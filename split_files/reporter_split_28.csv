10731383,"Diabetes affects more than 30 million Americans over the age of 18, including nearly one quarter of
Veterans. The estimated yearly cost of diabetes in the United States is $245 billion, and the medical
expenditures of people with diabetes is 2.3 times higher than they would be in the absence of diabetes. In
addition to the many medical complications and co-existing conditions associated with diabetes, diabetes also
confers a greater risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia. AD pathogenesis is thought to
begin many years prior to the clinical diagnosis, so there has been significant focus on the use of biological
methods to detect AD prior to the frank cognitive impairment that is observed in the mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) and dementia phases. While PET neuroimaging with radioactive tracers and lumbar puncture (LP) to
obtain cerebrospinal fluid levels of AD markers (Ab, p-tau, total tau) have drawn significant attention and are
important for our understanding of the pathogenesis of AD, these methods are not without limitations.
Specifically, these approaches are expensive, still in experimental phases in regard to understanding
implications of “positive” findings, invasive (require injection of radioactive tracers or LP), and often
inaccessible due to location (e.g., rural setting), cost, or medical contraindications (e.g., on blood thinners).
Therefore, there is a significant need to develop and implement sensitive neuropsychological markers that
capture subtle, preclinical cognitive changes, before objective impairment associated with MCI and dementia.
 The proposed study aims to examine neuropsychological (NP) process scores as a method for
detecting the earliest cognitive changes associated with diabetes and to use these scores to predict cognitive
and functional decline. NP process scores are derived from standard NP tests, but provide information about
how the Veteran obtained an overall total score (e.g., types of errors that were made, learning slope). Process
scores have been shown to add value in predicting future cognitive decline and can be used to identify subtle
cognitive decline in preclinical AD. This study will involve 1) a retrospective record review of 200 Veterans (100
with diabetes) without a neurocognitive disorder who previously completed a neuropsychological assessment
as part of their VA clinical care, 2) recruitment of a subset of these 200 Veterans (n=46; [23 with diabetes]) to
be followed longitudinally, and 3) prospective recruitment of 66 new Veterans (33 with diabetes) who will have
baseline arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging to examine cerebral blood flow as a potential
marker of cognitive inefficiency in diabetes; they will also be followed longitudinally [(total longitudinal
n=112)]. This study is highly innovative in that it is the first to use NP process scores to identify subtle cognitive
changes and predict future decline in diabetic Veterans that do not yet have a neurocognitive disorder.
 The goal of this Career Development Award (CDA-2) is for the candidate to develop the necessary
skills to become an independent scientist investigating the earliest cognitive changes and inefficiencies in
Veterans with diabetes. This CDA-2 application includes a comprehensive training program that builds upon
the applicant’s background and existing skills in NP assessment/diagnosis, cognitive aging, and longitudinal
analyses. The training plan is focused on building additional competencies in understanding diabetes
mechanisms and standards of care, neuroimaging of cerebral perfusion, and developing further expertise in
application of NP process scores. The multidisciplinary mentoring team includes an endocrinologist, a
magnetic resonance physicist, and neuropsychologists with expertise spanning both vascular risk factors and
process scores. The proposed project and the exceptional training opportunities available at the VA San Diego
Healthcare System and the University of California, San Diego will assist the applicant in accomplishing her
long-term career objective of transitioning into an independent VA clinical scientist conducting patient-oriented
research in the field of neuropsychology and dementia risk in diabetes."
10731384,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a human alpha herpesvirus (αHV), establishes lifelong latent infection in ganglionic neurons of >90% humans worldwide, reactivating in one-third to cause herpes zoster (HZ), debilitating pain and stroke. How VZV maintains latency remains unclear. Despite the availability of two FDA-approved HZ vaccines, it is likely that HZ will remain a common and clinically important disease for many years to come. Currently, the VZV latent state is resistant to antiviral targeting, and the triggers of reactivation remain poorly defined. We argue that better knowledge of VZV latency and reactivation will establish the basis for new anti- VZV strategies to reduce the HZ burden. There is no appropriate animal model to study VZV latency and reactivation. To study these processes, our groups pioneered the study of naturally VZV-infected human trigeminal ganglia (TG) and a human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cultured neuron model. We discovered the consistent detection of a novel spliced VZV RNA in human TG, the VZV latency-associated transcript (VLT), which has a genomic position similar to that in other neurotropic αHVs and is antisense to the VZV transactivator from open reading frame 61 (ORF61, ortholog of HSV ICP0). Notably, VLT encodes a protein of unknown function. Human TG also contains ORF63 RNAs, whose protein has roles in regulating viral gene expression and blocking apoptosis. Our overlying hypothesis is that VLT is important for VZV neuronal infection and the latent state, whereas ORF63 is involved in the initiation of reactivation. Our three specific aims are designed to address the VZV latent state genes in both cadaveric human TG and cultured neuron models of VZV latency and reactivation. In Specific Aim 1, we will perform in-depth in situ analyses of latently VZV-infected human TG and VZV-infected cultured hESC neurons to determine if specific human neuron subtypes host VZV latency and reactivation. In Specific Aim 2, we will dissect the mechanisms by which the VLT transcript and/or its encoding protein contribute to lytic, latent and reactivated VZV infections, by making several recombinant VZV VLT mutants and evaluating them in our hESC-derived neuron platform. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will determine the molecular chromatin modifications occurring at the VLT and ORF63 loci during VZV latency and reactivation in both human TG and hESC neurons, using chromatin immunoprecipitations to analyze CTCF binding, phospho/methyl switch of histone protein 3 and paused RNA polymerase II on VZV genomes. By sharing our complementary materials, methods and longstanding expertise in VZV biology, we are now uniquely positioned to characterize VZV latency ex vivo and systematically analyze the function of VLT and its encoded protein in vitro. Successful completion of our proposal will provide insight into molecular mechanisms that regulate VZV latency and reactivation. This will provide leads towards the development of novel intervention strategies that effectively target latent VZV and consequently the burden of HZ disease."

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a prominent contributor to disability, burden, and
increased mortality. Although impairments in self (RDoC Systems for Social Processes:
Perception and understanding of self) and interpersonal (RDoC Systems for Social Processes:
Affiliation) functioning originate in early childhood, little is known about the developmental
psychopathology of these core features in BPD, as opposed to a related psychiatric disorder that
often precedes and co-develops with BPD: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The current
proposal will establish developmental trajectories of interpersonal and self dysfunction from early
childhood into young adulthood, examining interactions with environmental factors and
associations with aberrant neural circuitry, to predict onset of BPD in early adulthood. In this
renewal, we leverage 17 years of previously collected longitudinal data (R01 MH090786) from
348 young children enriched for emotional dysregulation. Now young adults (19-25 years), 36%
exhibit BPD above diagnostic threshold. This sample offers an unparalleled opportunity to
understand specific developmental precursors for BPD onset. Rich phenotyping, including over a
decade of clinical interviews, narratives, questionnaires, observations, and repeated MRI and
EEG assessments make this the ideal and highly cost-effective dataset to investigate impairments
in self and interpersonal functioning that lead to BPD versus MDD. New data collection in young
adulthood includes multi-method assessments of interpersonal and self functioning alongside
psychiatric diagnostic interviews. Our motivating hypothesis is that in the context of emotion
dysregulation, peer acceptance and aggression (interpersonal dysfunction) from preschool
through middle childhood, interacts with self-functioning (unstable, incoherent self-worth and self-
concept) in adolescence to uniquely predict BPD onset in adulthood versus MDD. We will
examine: (1) how specific aspects of these constructs prospectively relate to adult BPD, as
opposed to continuation of MDD; (2) during which developmental periods these constructs
provide the most predictive utility, including the moderating effect of specific environmental factors;
and (3) assess the predictive and mechanistic role of neural correlates of these constructs in
forecasting BPD versus MDD. Findings will inform the optimal timing and content-focus (i.e.,
specific neural/behavioral self and interpersonal targets) of novel early-intervention for preventing
BPD during the earliest developmental periods. This longitudinal research will be able to identify
risk factors for the persistence or worsening of interpersonal and self dysfunction and BPD onset,
offering the best starting point toward developing a prevention strategy for BPD."
10897021,"The long-term goal of this project is to further reduce the biological uncertainty associated with surveillance for
favorable-risk prostate cancer. Although most men with favorable-risk disease are candidates for surveillance,
its use varies widely and ranges from 20 to 90% across individual providers. A major barrier to implementation
by providers, and acceptance by patients, relates to uncertainty around the biology of Grade Group 1 (GG1;
Gleason 6) prostate cancer. Key unresolved questions include: Does GG1 prostate cancer progress over time?
Does GG1 cancer share molecular origins with higher-grade disease and lymph node metastases? Are there
molecular features of GG1 tumors that predict the presence of synchronous, but undetected, higher-grade
disease elsewhere in the prostate? Is GG1 cancer more aggressive in African Americans? To be sure, the
biological trajectory of GG1 prostate cancer represents a critical knowledge gap. We hypothesize that GG1
prostate cancer rarely undergoes clonal grade progression, and that molecular changes in GG1 cancer do not
predict the presence of synchronous higher-grade disease. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following
aims: 1) to determine if high-grade prostate cancer arises clonally from GG1 prostate cancer in men on
surveillance over time, 2) to molecularly dissect GG1 prostate cancer both within and without the context of
synchronous grade discordant multifocality, and 3) to interrogate primary multifocal prostate cancer for shared
clonality between GG1 and higher-grade disease/lymph node or distant metastases. The successful
completion of the aims of this project will alter the way men with GG1 prostate cancer are clinically managed
by further reducing uncertainty about the clinical and molecular arc of favorable-risk disease. Practically, these
findings have the potential to provide confidence to providers and patients when selecting surveillance for GG1
prostate cancer by reducing concerns over clonal disease progression and by shedding light on the likelihood
of co-existing higher-risk cancer that has yet to be detected—factors that play key roles in the selection and
effective implementation of surveillance. Our research team composed of experts in prostate cancer
management, molecular profiling, and bioinformatics, coupled with our distinctive and extensive access to
relevant tissue resources, is uniquely poised to complete our research plan.

Asymmetric Synthesis of Nitrogen Heterocycles
Abstract
 Nitrogen is ubiquitously found in biologically active molecules and pharmaceuticals, the fourth most
common element after carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Its presence impacts interactions with biological targets,
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as myriad physical properties. Given the increased
importance of saturation in drug-like molecules, carbon-nitrogen bonds are increasingly stereogenic and thus,
methods to incorporate nitrogen should likewise address doing so in stereocontrolled fashion. We have long
been interested in constructing saturated nitrogen heterocycles from commonly available feedstocks to
address synthetic challenges associates with the most common rings such as piperidines and pyrrolidines.
With this competitive renewal, we seek support to address problems associated with acyclic nitrogen
containing molecules.
 Herein we propose a multi-pronged approach to synthesize complex structures containing nitrogen
substitution from simple precursors. We focus on using the most commonly available starting materials such as
alkenes and dienes, and forge a union to a modestly activated nitrogen coupling partner. Ideal among the latter
is the dioxazolone moiety, trivially assembled from carboxylic acids, hydroxylamine and a phosgene
equivalent. Importantly, after C-N bond formation, the product is the amide, thereby avoiding subsequent
derivatization. We further illustrate that this union can be conducted in an exceedingly complex setting.

10886804,"Ceramide constitutes a family of closely related molecules that function as bioeffector
lipids with roles in the regulation of stress responses and growth/death of various human
cancer cells. Critical missing elements in our understanding of ceramide stem from the
lack of defining compartment-specific functions of ceramides and from lack of molecularly-
defined targets of action. Studies in our lab supported by this project have identified
ceramide-activated Ser–Thr phosphatases (CAPPs), specifically PP1 and PP2A as direct
targets activated by ceramide in vitro. Recent results have provided us a breakthrough in
defining a specific pathway of ceramide generation at the plasma membrane (PM). Here,
we will investigate the hypothesis that ceramide generated at the PM acutely activates
PP1α that leads to the dephosphorylation of distinct proteins, launching a distinct program
of regulation of cell adhesion and migration. We are also developing a novel assay to
quantitate PM ceramide specifically. With this breakthrough, we will address these aims:
Aim 1. Develop a quantitative assay to measure ceramide generation at the PM and
define key enzymes of ceramide metabolism in this compartment (steady state). Aim 2.
Define stimulus-induced formation of PM ceramide and the mechanisms involved. Aim 3.
Define biochemical mechanisms of regulation of PP1a by PM ceramide. Taken together,
these approaches should result, for the first time, in clearly defining a specific, direct, and
relevant target for ceramide action (PP1) with a specific function in mediating the effects
of PM ceramide on cell adhesion and migration."

Apart from the acute illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, it is now clear that a significant percentage of patients
develop long-term conditions post COVID-19, including systemic and respiratory symptoms. Given the
catastrophic spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally, there are many individuals that recover from acute
COVID-19 and develop permanent impairment in lung function which can cause exertional dyspnea, fatigue (due
to chronic hypoxia), and other limitations. This number will become even larger as the pandemic continues to
progress.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms underlying the development of
chronic respiratory sequelae of COVID-19 to develop
preventive and therapeutic interventions.
In this application, we aim to unravel the driving mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets of chronic
lung sequelae following COVID-19. To achieve this goal, we propose two Specific Aims (SA) for the study. SA
1. Decipher cellular and molecular traits underlying chronic lung sequelae post-acute COVID-19.
We will
enroll
 a group of COVID-19 convalescents that are expected to develop chronic lung sequelae after prior severe
acute disease and a control population that completely recovered from previous mild or non-symptomatic
COVID-19 infection. We will conduct comprehensive clinical examination supplemented by quantitative chest
CT imaging and pulmonary function testing to determine clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of the
two populations. We will collect longitudinal blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) to obtain immune,
molecular, and viral profiles in COVID-19 convalescents and controls. This unique approach integrating
systemic and respiratory clinical, pathophysiological, cellular, molecular, and viral profiles of control or COVID-
19 convalescents will be highly compelling for future druggable target discovery. SA2. Model and validate
targets of chronic lung sequelae post-acute COVID-19 in an animal model. We will establish a mouse model
of chronic lung sequelae post-acute COVID-19. We will characterize systemic and respiratory host cellular and
molecular responses in the model. integrate mouse and human data for
validation of mechanistic links and discovery of new insights and/or targets for therapeutic interventions. We will
then use the model to test whether target dysregulated respiratory CD8+ T cell responses could ameliorate
chronic lung sequelae post-acute COVID-19.
We will employ system biology tools to
The successful completion of the study will generate unprecedented insights on clinical, viral, and immune traits
of pulmonary sequelae, and will identify key causal immune mechanisms and therapeutic targets against chronic
lung diseases post-acute COVID-19."

Tremendous advances have been made in the study of adipose biology but there are gaps in our understanding
of adipose development and functions. The long-term goal of our research is to understand how adipose tissues
regulate whole-body energy metabolism, insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. To achieve these goals,
we have developed cellular and animal models to study the effects of gene perturbations in relation to adipose
tissues development. One such gene is Four-and-half-LIM domain 1 (FHL1), a protein highly expressed in
skeletal and cardiac muscles, and has recently been implicated in human adipose tissue development. A case
report on a 15-year old patient with a complete deletion of FHL1 with adjacent MAP7D3 gene exhibited a near
total loss of adipose tissues accompanied by muscular hypertrophy, rigid spine and short stature. The specific
role of FHL1 in adipose development and function is unknown. In preliminary experiments, we identified FHL1
as a major co-transcription factor of PPARg, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation of adipose tissues. To
mimic the loss of adipose tissues in the human patient, we created a mouse model where FHL1 is globally
deficient. Whole body Fhl1 knockout mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity (DIO). Interestingly, a previous
study has shown that mice lacking a related paralog, FHL2, are also resistant to DIO. We found that FHL1
deficiency in murine preadipocytes partially attenuated differentiation into adipocytes, and a single amino acid
substitution from tryptophan to serine at position 122 within FHL1 specifically abrogated PPARg isoform 2
(PPARg2) expression, but not isoform 1 (PPARg1). In agreement, knockdown of FHL1 in human adipocytes
preferentially reduced PPARg2 expression, but not PPARg1. It has been reported that PPARg2 is adipose-
specific, necessary and sufficient in activation of adipogenesis in fibroblast. In addition to activation of PPARg,
FHL1 cooperates with PPARg in activation of PPARg-dependent gene expression. Based on our preliminary data,
we hypothesized that FHL1 regulates adipocyte differentiation, at least in part, through transcriptional regulation
of PPARg. This proposal seeks to investigate the cellular, molecular and physiological mechanisms by which
FHL1 regulates adipose tissue development and energy homeostasis. Specific Aim 1 will examine the roles of
FHL1 and FHL2 in murine adipocyte differentiation. Specific Aim 2 will address the underlying molecular
mechanisms linking FHL1 and transcriptional regulation of adipocyte differentiation. Specific Aim 3 will
investigate the in vivo functions of FHL1 in adipose-specific knockout mice and in human transplant models.
Together, the proposed experiments will provide mechanistic insights into adipose biology, pathophysiology of
obesity, potentially lead to novel therapeutic strategies for obesity and related metabolic diseases."

Parkinson’s disease is an umbrella of different subtypes that manifest with distinct clinical features and different
underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Genetics, inflammation, and accumulation of alpha-synuclein are the main
pathogenic drivers of the disease, playing a different role in sub-groups of patients. Stratifying patients based on
the main pathogenic mechanisms is becoming key in the scenario of precision medicine. Extensive
characterization of the role of these pathogenic mechanisms in early onset Parkinson’s disease (EOPD) is
lacking. EOPD is a rare condition where PD manifests in patients before the age of 50 years and thus affecting
large part of the lives of these subjects. Our central hypothesis is that EOPD implies different sub-types of
patients with prognostic outcomes related to diverse contribution of genetics, inflammation and alpha-synuclein
accumulation in their pathogenesis. The overall objective of this proposal will be to characterize the contribution
of genetics, inflammation, and alpha-synuclein accumulation in large cohort of EOPD and assess how these
mechanisms can guide the identification of EOPD sub-types. To achieve this objective the main aims of this
proposal will focus on 1) characterizing the clinical and genetic profile of a large cohort of EOPD; 2) assessing
the presence of alpha-synuclein in central and peripheral biosamples; 3) profiling the central and peripheral
inflammatory activation of EODP compared to late onset PD (LOPD) and non-affected subjects (CTRL). For the
first aim we will perform a deep phenotypical characterization of a population of EOPD patients and identify
phenotypical clusters through an unbiased hierarchical cluster analysis. Subjects will also be profiled genetically
through Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) for the identification of known and new genetic variants, and for
burden analysis of rare gene variants. In the second aim we will assess alpha-synuclein amplification assay, one
of the most promising innovative biomarkers for synucleinopathy, on skin biopsies and CSF of subjects with
EOPD. In the third aim we will characterize the expression profiles of single cells data and an extensive proteomic
panel for inflammatory markers from peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid of EOPD, LOPD and CTRL, to
determine inflammatory activation in EOPD and characterize cell-specific (innate vs adaptive immunity).
Finally, we will correlate data from the three aims to assess the profiles of genetics, clinical, inflammatory, and
biomarkers data in EOPD sub-types. While most of the current research on this topic focuses on single aspects
of the disease, this research proposal is innovative because it correlates different disease mechanisms to detect
subtypes of EOPD. The main significance of this project will be to provide new insights in the pathogenesis of
EOPD which will be informative to the design of mechanism-driven therapeutic approaches for EOPD, provide
useful information for patient counseling, and stratify patients for clinical trials."

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition diagnosed when dysfunction of organs results from severe infection.
Sepsis affects approximately 1 million patients in the United States each year. About one-half of patients with
sepsis have evidence of injury to the heart muscle called ‘myocardial injury’. Multiple pathways can lead to
myocardial injury during sepsis. Even though patients with myocardial injury during sepsis have worse
outcomes, there is currently little information to inform the best approach to evaluate these patients, to inform
the likely pathways leading to myocardial injury in individual patients, or to guide the selection of optimal
treatments. We propose the “Informing best practices for evaluation and treatment of myocardial injury during
sepsis” study to provide clinically actionable information to benchmark and guide the care of patients with
myocardial injury in sepsis. We will use existing longitudinal electronic health record data from two large
integrated healthcare systems in the United States to efficiently determine the patterns of testing and treatment
and the factors that predict the patients most likely to respond to treatments for pathways involving coronary
artery disease. We will also assess the effectiveness of commonly used blood thinners for myocardial injury in
sepsis. We have assembled a team with a record of collaboration and expertise in the use of electronic health
record data to study sepsis outcomes, mechanisms and biomarkers of myocardial injury, and observational
research methodology. Results from our proposal will inform current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and
guide the design and conduct of future randomized trials investigating optimal clinical pathways for patients
with myocardial injury in sepsis."

10892868,"The co-occurrence of age-related cognitive and sensory organ impairments exacerbates negative effects on the health, lifestyle, and quality of life of older adults. These age-related multimorbidities include Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD), in addition to sensory declines such as loss of vision, hearing, and olfaction (sense of smell). We hypothesize that these multimorbidities share common neurotoxicant risk factors that are present in the home environment. With the recent increase in time spent at home, the human exposure to home environment neurotoxicants is changing. However, the effects of these changes on the risk of developing neurocognitive-sensory aging and AD/ADRD are unknown and will take many decades to understand in humans. We propose to study pet (companion) dogs as an efficient sentinel model for the human health impacts of home environment-derived neurotoxicants. Pet dogs are promising sentinels as they share the human indoor and outdoor home environment, share similar exposure to toxicants in the home, yet have shorter latency of onset of toxic effects. Dog lifespan is significantly shorter than humans, yet both species experience similar multimorbidities of neurocognitive-sensory aging. Therefore, epidemiologic studies in dogs could help us quickly understand the human health implications of changes in risk factor exposure. We will determine shared human/dog neurotoxicant exposure and dog neurocognitive-sensory outcomes related to a common group of neurotoxicants found in the home environment, the toxic heavy metals As, Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb. These metals accumulate in neurologic tissues and have well-defined neurotoxic effects, but their effect on age-related neurologic decline is unclear. In Aim 1 we will establish shared risk of multimorbidity of neurocognitive-sensory aging in cohabiting humans and dogs. We will determine the cognitive and sensory function declines associated with aging in dogs and relate the trajectory of dog declines to cohabiting human declines. In Aim 2 we will validate companion dogs as sentinels for human and environmental heavy metal exposure by comparing drinking water and house dust concentrations of heavy metals with dog and human blood concentrations of heavy metals. In Aim 3 we will determine the impact of high heavy metal burden on dog neurocognitive-sensory aging multimorbidities, and on metabolism in the blood. The outcomes of this work will establish the companion dog as a relevant, expedient surrogate model of human age-related neurocognitive-sensory decline and AD/ADRD risk and confirm that humans and dogs share home environment heavy metal risk factors that increase the risk of metabolic dysfunction and neurocognitive-sensory decline in aging. Future studies could utilize this sentinel dog model to test promising therapeutics prior to translation to humans. This work is relevant to the mission of multiple NIH institutes as it encompasses the important topics of aging, cognitive decline, sensory decline, and toxicant risk factors for neurocognitive-sensory aging and AD/ADRD risk in a relevant animal model with an accelerated timeline."

Despite recent progress, clinical heterogeneity has likely hindered efforts to clearly delineate the genetic
architecture of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, this heterogeneity also
presents an opportunity for studying individuals with extreme phenotypes, virulent forms of the illness with
putatively more homogeneous etiologies. Early onset psychosis (EOP, onset prior to 18 years) represents such
an extreme phenotype, with dramatically higher rates of rare deleterious mutations in EOP than adult-onset
psychosis. Consequently, studying EOP cohorts provides a unique opportunity to discover rare genetic loci
influencing illness risk. We will deep phenotype and sequence 1900 EOP probands and 1900 non-psychotic,
demographically matched youth. For 400 probands, both parents and a non-psychotic sibling will be recruited
to facilitate the search for inherited and de novo mutations associated with EOP (n=1200 family members).
Children and adolescents and their families will be recruited from a single, large public pediatric psychiatric
hospital in Mexico City. To date, most psychiatric genetic studies focus on European-ancestry (EA) cohorts,
while excluding of other ancestry groups. Yet, no single population is sufficient to fully illuminate the genetic
architecture of complex traits like psychosis, and the EA focus could exacerbate health care disparities. Latinos
make up ~8% of the world population (~18% of the US population) but appear in less than 1% of published
genome-wide studies. Complicating matters, Latinos are genetically heterogeneous, with substantial
differences between Central and South American and Caribbean populations, reflecting continental-level
ancestral group admixture and the substructure of local Indigenous American populations. As 62% of the
Latinos in the US are of Mexican origin findings from the Mexican population are directly relevant for most
individuals in the nation’s largest racial/ethnic minority. During our initial 1-year project, we recruited 1000
participants from the same psychiatric hospital and using identical procedures, thus demonstrating the
feasibility of the current study. Combining these 1000 individuals with the additional 5000 participants we now
propose to acquire, we aim to: 1) characterize EOP probands and siblings in terms of cognitive and
psychosocial functioning, frequency of adverse life events, social determinants, and cannabis use; 2)
document the prevalence of rare loss of function mutations and CNVs previously associated with
schizophrenia or autism spectrum disorder in EOP participants relative to their unaffected family members and
demographic and population controls; and 3) utilize ancestry analysis to identify chromosomal regions and
runs of homozygosity shared in common by multiple unrelated EOP cases but not by unaffected individuals.

10728874,"Problem: Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severely limits quality of life. Current PTSD treatments have
limited and variable efficacy. New and more effective treatments are necessary. Patients with PTSD often have
disrupted sleep. These patients are more likely to wake up multiple times a night, and have decreased slow
wave sleep and increased REM sleep. Further, autonomic and behavioral components during sleep are
consistent with a continued fight or flight state while asleep. This includes higher heart rate, lower
parasympathetic tone, and greater likelihood of nightmares. PTSD is also associated with higher insomnia
severity scores as well as regional neurotransmitter disruptions in systems critical for the regulation of affect.
Poor sleep quality is associated with poor health outcomes that overlap with those that are experienced in
PTSD. These include associations with the development of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and inflammatory
diseases including arthritis. Effective treatment of sleep problems in this population could have substantial
impact on these symptoms and improve quality of life. Heterogeneity in PTSD, including hyperarousal
symptom expression and prior occurring mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), may influence individual
differences in treatment response. mTBI is a common occurring preceding injury to PTSD and damage to
limbic white matter structures may influence presentation of PTSD.
Current pharmacological approaches often have side effects like negative impacts on sleep architecture,
addiction, and cognitive performance consequences. Further, Veterans often report that they use alcohol and
other drugs in order to fall asleep and stop nightmares, compounding the issue. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS)
approaches have potential, especially in this population to improve sleep quality and to also improve
hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD.
Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) induces activation of the parasympathetic nervous system and suppression of
amygdala activity, addressing the core components of hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD. Conventional VNS
requires neurosurgery. However, we will investigate a novel, non-invasive approach: transcutaneous vagal
nerve stimulation (tVNS). tVNS has a high potential for success in this population.
Preliminary work. Our pilot data demonstrate increased slow wave sleep, and decreased REM sleep and
sleep latency after one hour of tVNS at “lights out.” The mechanism for this may be the result of decreasing
hyperarousal symptoms during the first hour of sleep; all participants showed increased high frequency heart
rate variability during tVNS compared with sham. We have also previously demonstrated tVNS improvement of
hyperarousal signs of PTSD including upregulation of parasympathetic nervous system and attenuation of
sympathetic nervous system activity during ‘startle’ in Veterans with PTSD with or without history of mTBI.
Plan Our objective is to use tVNS in Veterans with PTSD with or without history of mTBI to evaluate its efficacy
in changing sleep architecture (aim 1) and hyperarousal symptoms (aim 2). We will also assess the impact of
pre-occurring mTBI and heterogeneity of PTSD symptoms on treatment response (aim 3) as well as safety and
tolerability features. We will use a within-subject sham-controlled cross-over design to assess the impact of
tVNS administered at “lights out” for one hour on several critical sleep variables including sleep onset, slow
wave sleep, REM sleep, and autonomic nervous system behavior."

Dr. Mey is a productive young scientist applying for this mentored K01 award to transition to an independent research
career. He has a strong nutrition (registered dietitian) and metabolism (translational research) background, focusing on
metabolic disease. He has a history of growth and productivity throughout the evolution of his research career into his
current role as an assistant professor. His recent findings have directed his interest towards a major literature gap: the impact
of nutrition on asthma control and lung function – relevant to the mission of NHLBI.
An emerging concept in asthma pathophysiology is altered nutrient metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Nutritional
intake has a direct impact on whole-body and cellular nutrient metabolism, and several nutritional approaches show promise
to improve lung function. However, well-controlled feeding trials are lacking, leaving a major knowledge gap in our
understanding of nutrition in asthma. Further, nutrition research has come under intense scrutiny for major barriers,
including inter-individual variability, slow development and poor translation to clinical application.
To address this important knowledge gap and overcome critical barriers in nutrition research, the proposed aims will utilize
an innovative multi-diet crossover clinical feeding trial design in combination with an n-of-1 qualitative pilot. The feeding
trial will test three distinct, fully-provided, isocaloric diets to identify nutritional and metabolic factors that impact asthma
control and lung function. This will be followed by a qualitative pilot of an n-of-1 approach, which incorporates patient-
informed decisions into the nutrition treatment model and is critical to the progression of individualized nutrition care.
Additionally, untargeted plasma metabolomic profiling will be used in combination with machine-learning biostatistics to
generate preliminary precision nutrition models for future clinical research. Finally, an in vitro approach will define the
mitochondrial defects in airway smooth muscle cells from an asthmatic donor and determine whether chronic ketone
exposure can normalize altered mitochondrial bioenergetics. Together, the clinical findings, qualitative pilot and elucidation
of a biological mechanism defining the diet-asthma relationship will support Dr. Mey’s transition to independence.
To enable Dr. Mey to carry out these aims and transition his nutrition and metabolism expertise into the pulmonary field,
Dr. Mey has enlisted the mentorship of 5 established researchers and clinicians for the fulfillment of the training detailed
within this project, including: 1) academic and professional development in asthma and mitochondrial biology, 2) clinical
management of asthma, 3) support to implement a multi-diet crossover feeding trial, and 4) career development and grant
writing guidance. In addition, Dr. Mey assembled a team of 4 collaborators and advisors for technical and scientific insight.
Pennington Biomedical Research Center will provide an ideal learning environment, with exceptional core services to
conduct clinical trials, supplemented by training with physician-mentors both locally (Tulane) and abroad (Cleveland
Clinic). Together, this coordinated clinical-translational training will provide Dr. Mey with the tools to complete the
proposed aims, expand his expertise of nutrition and metabolism into the pulmonary field, and establish independence in
the pursuit of his long-term goal: to identify precision nutrition approaches for the treatment and management of asthma."

Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people—individuals whose gender identity differs from the sex they
were assigned at birth—comprise approximately 1.6% of U.S. adults. Gender identity represents one’s concept
of self and can be the same as one’s sex assigned at birth (cisgender), different from one’s sex assigned at
birth (transgender), or beyond traditional classifications (non-binary, gender fluid, gender diverse). TGD
populations are disproportionately burdened by physical and mental health inequities and are a designated
NIH health disparities population. The recent explosion of biobanking, and more routine collection of gender
identity data and affords an opportunity to study possible genomic associations with gender identity. Such
research could affirm gender identity, or be used to pathologize and discriminate, limit access to care, or
influence the use of reproductive technologies. We aim to guide the field in order to maximize benefit and
minimize harm of such studies and meet a time sensitive need to inform how genomic data are collected,
analyzed, and reported to benefit diverse TGD populations and to advance scientific understanding. Research
on genomics and gender identity should be conducted with, and not on TGD communities to ensure that we do
not repeat past wrongs, for example excluding racial/ethnic populations from the conduct and reporting of
research that impacts these populations and further reifying stereotypes and stigma. In partnership with and
guided by a racially, ethnically, professionally and geographically diverse Executive Stakeholder Board and
workgroups consisting of TGD community members, advocates, clinicians, and ethics, legal, and genomics
and health equity scholars, we will explore perspectives on the potential risks and benefits of studying genomic
associations with gender identity. Together we will: 1) assess gaps in the literature and define ELSI themes for
further exploration and inclusion in the Guidelines; 2) conduct a sequential mixed-methods study comprised of
in-depth qualitative interviews with TGD community members (N=40); quantitative surveys with TGD
community members (N=400); and listening sessions with key stakeholders (genomics researchers, TGD-
serving clinicians, ethical and legal scholars, institutional review board members) (N=32); and 3) convene a
larger Summit to develop the Guidelines. We will use a formal process of deliberative engagement led by a
facilitator with experience in facilitated dialogue in TGD communities to identify priorities, resolve conflicts,
make decisions, develop guidelines and recommendations, and widely disseminate these to policy, research
and TGD communities This project will address aspects of all four NHGRI/ELSI priority research areas. Our
work will result in standards and best practices to guide genomic research about gender identity. Our Board,
Workgroups and Summit participants will function as a national network to provide ongoing consultation,
guidance, and leadership on genomics research with TGD populations."

Adipose tissue (AT) is an active metabolic organ that contains a network of immune cells whose crosstalk
regulates adipose tissue homeostasis. In response to obesity, these immune cells can become activated,
expand, and secrete adipokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines that modify local and systemic insulin
sensitivity and contribute to the development of metabolic dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. Promotion and
maintenance of adipose tissue inflammation in the obese state has been shown to involve the activation of
adipose tissue T cells (ATT), which potentiate the activity of pro-inflammatory adipose tissue macrophages
(ATMs) in mouse models of obesity. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the mechanisms by
which ATTs are maintained, their diversity relative to other T cell subsets, and the signals to which ATTs
respond during adipose tissue remodeling and expansion. Our preliminary data assessing early ATT kinetics
demonstrated that ATTs proliferate in response to the rapid AT expansion induced by short-term high-fat diet
(HFD) feeding. Timepoints assessed in these experiments precede the substantial infiltration of pro-
inflammatory ATMs associated with the obese state, suggesting ATTs play vital roles in the initiation of AT
inflammation observed in the obese state. This proposal seeks to test the hypothesis that ATT proliferation in
response to short-term HFD feeding requires signals from antigen presenting cells (APCs). Further, the
proposed research will interrogate the establishment of memory ATT and the determinant which drive the
priming of their responses to AT changes in the obese state. Lastly, the PI’s prior research uncovered a unique
population of TCRαβ CD3+ CD4- CD8- double negative (DN) ATTs and will test the hypothesis that DN ATTs
possess an immunoregulatory phenotype and function in maintaining AT homeostasis and controlling effector
ATTs during development of obesity. To test these hypotheses, the proposed project will pursue the following
Aims during the K99 phase of this award: 1) To determine driver(s) of ATT proliferation during short-term HFD
feeding and 2) to identify phenotype and function of DN ATTs in the lean and obese state. During this time, the
PI will receive research training in nutrient metabolism in mice, bioinformatics and sequencing analysis, and
translational research in obesity and diabetes. During the independent R00 phase, the PI will continue these
Aims and seek to 3) determine establishment of resident memory ATTs and signals required for their induction
and maintenance. Completion of this work will have significant impact on identification of the regulators of ATT
functions in lean and obese states and elucidate novel targets to suppress obesity-associated AT inflammation
mediated by ATT responses. Training in proposed techniques outlined in the K99 phase will ensure successful
formation of the PI’s independent research program centering on obesity-associated inflammation and
metabolic dysfunction, and how ATTs contribute to the initiation, orchestration, and maintenance of AT
inflammation and subsequent insulin resistance."

 The metabolism of pathogenic microorganisms has to be flexible as the efficient replication of pathogenic bacteria in
the host depends on an active adaptation process. Human infection by the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae, requires
multiple adaptation processes that ultimately lead to robust virulence factor production in the small intestine. Although a
link between the metabolic status and virulence factor expression has been described in several pathogens, it has not been
investigated in detail in V. cholerae. Similarly, the role of membrane bioenergetics in bacterial virulence is not well
understood, although most pathogenic organisms extensively utilize membrane respiration for part of their physiology. Our
previous results suggest that changes in membrane bioenergetics affect virulence gene expression in V. cholerae. More
specifically, loss of the main V. cholerae respiration enzyme (NQR) leads to changes in virulence gene transcription. Here,
we propose to perform an investigation into the link between membrane respiration and virulence gene regulation in V.
cholerae, with an emphasis on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the quinone pool. It has been well documented that
multiple virulence-associated transcription factors sense oxidative stress in V. cholerae via post-translational modifications
such as thiol-switches. We have previously established NQR as a source of both periplasmic as well as cytoplasmic ROS.
Moreover, we recently developed a method to produce varying levels of ROS in V. cholerae by manipulating the expression
level of NQR and in parallel, the level of cytoplasmic ROS in live cells can be monitored using a novel, fluorophore-based
approach. This system enables us to quantitatively correlate ROS levels with the expression of genes encoding for virulence
factors in V. cholerae. Overall, we expect to gain important insights into the metabolic capacity of this organism per se and
its relation to virulence gene expression as an important aspect of pathogenesis. Our rationale for this project is that the
generation of fundamental information concerning V. cholerae metabolism and its link to virulence factor production will
provide potential opportunities for novel treatment strategies for infections."

The SETER/PR index of sensitivity to endocrine therapy measures endocrine receptor-related transcription from
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor sections and is highly reproducible within and between laboratories.
SETER/PR values correlate with the ligand binding activity of estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors,
predict early pharmocodynamic response to endocrine therapy and prognosis following endocrine therapy in
palliative and adjuvant treatment settings. Secondly, SET2,3 index adjusts the measurements of SETER/PR
index for baseline prognostic factors, enabling the assessment of endocrine-related transcriptional activity in
the context of baseline prognostic risk. Both indices add independently prognostic information to contemporary
genomic tests, likely due to stronger prediction of the cancer’s sensitivity to endocrine therapy.
The NSABP B-42 trial compared extended duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy with letrozole for 5 additional
years, versus placebo for 5 years, in patients who had completed 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy.
Extended endocrine therapy demonstrated improved disease-free survival at 10 years from randomization,
although there was no difference between treatments during the initial 4 years. To-date, correlative science
studies from NSABP B-42 have evaluated the Breast Cancer Index 2-gene ratio of HOXB13/IL17BR
expression, the 70-gene MammaPrint assay, and normalized ESR1 gene expression scores from the 21-gene
Recurrence Score. All failed to demonstrate predictive interaction in their respective primary analyses,
although exploratory analyses suggest that prediction will be possible with a more specific biomarker.
We hypothesize that SETER/PR index will predict benefit from extended letrozole therapy (ELT) in hormone
receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer. Specifically, that ELT offers most benefit to patients whose
breast cancer has a moderate degree of endocrine sensitivity. Our primary analysis plan is to test whether
SETER/PR index between 1.10 and 2.10 (inclusive) has significant interaction with lower rate of breast cancer-
free interval (BCFI) from extended letrozole treatment. This represents an inter-quartile range from a similar
population to NSABP B-42. Secondary analyses will evaluate other endpoints, subtypes defined by nodal
status or prior tamoxifen treatment, and other cutpoints of SETER/PR index. Secondly, we will evaluate SET2,3
for long-term risk of late relapse in patients from each treatment arm.
Clinically, a robust predictor of benefit from extended duration of endocrine therapy will be useful, as 10 years
of treatment is too long for many patients to tolerate and the absolute rate of benefit is small in the overall
population with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Current evidence shows SETER/PR index to be an
independently strong predictor of tumoral sensitivity to endocrine therapy, and associated prognosis, with
strong potential to predict who is likely to benefit from longer duration of endocrine treatment.

Advances in technology for measuring neural activity at ever-larger scales and with increasing spatial and
temporal resolution, concomitant with a decrease in costs of data storage, are driving a revolution in
neuroscience. As neural data accumulates worldwide, a new challenge faces the global neuroscience
community: how to make sense of these complex data to drive biological insight and to shed new light on
neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. This new, data-driven era of neuroscientific research demands
that investigators master rigorous research principles and know when and how to apply these principles.
Accessible resources to develop hands-on experience with these rigorous research techniques are lacking in
neuroscience. To address this current and growing challenge, we propose to develop educational units
focused on specific principles of rigorous research. To reach the largest target audiences - the biologists,
psychologists, and clinicians working directly with neural data - we will assume only a basic mathematics
background and limited familiarity with computer programing, common to those trained in biological sciences.
The proposed educational units will target investigators at all career levels - spanning from the beginning
undergraduate researcher to the established PI - to understand and apply principles of rigorous research to
neural data. Through an interdisciplinary case-study approach, we will use real-world data from neuroscience
to motivate the study and application of rigorous research principles. To engage learners, we will develop
multimedia material combining written text, short video lectures, and computer programming exercises, that
promote hands-on learning of the material. The modular format will provide multiple coherent learning paths
through the online content, and thereby allow personalized learning for individuals with varying quantitative
backgrounds and research interests. The educational unit format will also permit the developed resources to
be widely available, disseminated, and discoverable, and easily integrated into the CENTER framework. The
proposed educational units will prepare researchers with the fundamental skills required for the analysis of
neural data and elevate the general competencies in rigorous research principles across the research
workforce."

Advances in omics technology have the power to provide integrative models of disease risk and influence
health outcomes. However, the utility of these models has so far been limited to non-African populations, due
to biases in available datasets. Further, efforts to identify medically relevant genetic variants have included only
a subset of known genetic variants and have had limited focus on phenotypes most relevant to Africa. Newly
available genomic datasets from the African continent provide a rich opportunity to begin addressing this gap.
Most large genomics efforts in both Africans and non-Africans have focused on single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), excluding a large fraction of more complex and ancestry-specific variant types such as
genomic repeats. Here, we consider multiple complex variant types, focusing on tandem repeats (TRs). TRs
are well known to contribute to human disease. For example, large repeat expansions are implicated in
Huntington’s Disease and other disorders, and stepwise variation in repeat copy number at TRs has been
implicated in a variety of complex traits. Although their role in human phenotypes is well established, discovery
efforts in repeat regions have been largely limited to datasets and phenotypes dominated by non-Africans.
We hypothesize that detailed analysis of repeat variants in Africa will identify novel disease-associated
loci including pathogenic repeat expansions, as well as improve the utility of risk prediction models,
ultimately leading to improved diagnosis and health outcomes. Our proposal leverages existing and novel data
analysis approaches to interrogate technically challenging repetitive regions and integrates diverse genomics
datasets from across the African continent including (1) whole genome-sequencing (WGS) from more than
1,000 individuals, (2) SNP array data from more than 10,000 individuals, and (3) health outcome information
related to trypanosomiasis, HIV status, chronic kidney disease, cancer risk, and cardiometabolic traits with high
prevalence in African populations. We will further incorporate existing biobanks containing tens of thousands of
diverse genomes (admixed Africans from All of Us and UK Biobank) to validate findings and improve power.
The overall goal of this proposal is to improve health outcomes in Africa using innovative data analysis
and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we will characterize genome-wide TR variation in African
individuals (Aim 1), identify signals of positive and negative selection at these regions (Aim 2), and identify TRs
associated with medically relevant phenotypes and generate improved ancestry specific polygenic risk scores
(Aim 3). We bring together a diverse team spanning Africa (headed by MPIs Adebiyi and Jjingo) and the US
(MPI Gymrek) which has already initiated a fruitful collaboration. Further, analyses will be performed primarily
using existing African supercomputing infrastructure and led by new and early-stage African investigators and
trainees. Overall, the proposed aims will likely identify novel medically relevant genetic variants and continue to
foster data science capabilities within Africa."

Voice dysfunction impairs the quality of life of affected patients and treating these disorders is associated with
substantial and far-ranging social, psychological, and economic costs. Vocal fold (VF) inflammatory lesions
cause common voice disorders related to disrupted epithelial homeostasis accompanied by inflammatory
infiltrates and changes in the lamina propria. In studies of the epithelium from elsewhere in the body, cell types
that originate hyperplasic changes are epithelial stem cells. These cells have the capability to self-renew and
give rise to the progeny of differentiated daughter cells which is regulated by the local microenvironment and
cell-autonomously via Notch signaling. Inactivation of Notch1 in the presence of inflammatory cytokines can
lead to epithelial hyperplasia, which can be modeled using in vitro organoids. The overall objective of this
proposal is to provide a comprehensive characterization of VF epithelial stem cells, their requirements for self-
renewal and differentiation under physiological conditions and in response to stress factors, namely injury and
mechanical load, while also creating VF organoids to elucidate molecular mechanisms that underline aberrant
epithelial remodeling as seen in benign inflammatory VF lesions. To achieve our goal we will genetically label
epithelial stem cells targeting the Lrig1 gene that has been linked to stemness properties in majority of epithelia
and our preliminary data show that Lrig1 is also expressed in human and murine VF epithelial cells. In Aim 1,
we will perform transcriptome profiling of murine and human VF Lrig1 cells and measure Lrig1 cell responses
to mechanical load during homeostasis. We will delineate the mechanistic role of murine Lrig1 cells in
homeostasis, and genetically inactivate Notch1 in murine Lrig1 cells to determine its effect on proliferation and
differentiation in vivo. In Aim 2, we will induce VF epithelial injury in a murine model, perform transcriptome
profiling of murine Lrig1 cells and measure their responses to mechanical load during epithelial recovery. We
will determine the functional role of murine Lrig1 cells and Notch1 signaling in re-epithelization. In Aim 3, we
will determine differentiation potential of murine and human VF Lrig1 cells using in vivo subrenal graft assay
and in vitro organoids. We will utilize VF organoids to model Notch-mediated epithelial hyperplasia using
genetic, pharmacologic approaches, and inflammatory cytokines. We will create a reliable culture system that
will improve our understanding of VF epithelial cell biology related to VF inflammatory lesions in the context of
personalized medicine."
10893601,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) of the
pancreas are cystic tumors that represent a radiographically identifiable precursor lesion of
pancreatic cancer. Currently, IPMN represent our best opportunity for intervention - and
interception - prior to the development of an incurable cancer. The challenge however, is current
laboratory, endoscopic, and imaging technologies are unable to distinguish between IPMN that is
at low-risk (low-grade dysplasia) or at high-risk (high-grade dysplasia) of becoming an invasive
cancer. In addition, our ability to improve diagnostic accuracy - particularly through biomarker
development - has been difficult, as IPMN is very heterogeneous with multiple histologic sub-
types and grades of dysplasia existing within the same lesion. Over the past 18 months we have
designed and performed pilot studies utilizing a novel spatial transcriptomics platform as a means
to spatially identify precise, sub-type specific, epithelial markers of high-grade dysplasia in the
tissue from patients resected for IPMN. These studies have found significant differences in gene
expression between both low-grade and high-grade dysplasia - and for the first time - have clearly
defined gene expression differences between intestinal and pancreaticobiliary sub-type IPMN.
The importance of this latter finding cannot be overemphasized, as intestinal sub-type IPMN will
typically progress to invasive colloid cancer, which is a much less aggressive malignancy.
Furthermore, we have identified differences in cyst fluid protein abundances between intestinal
and pancreaticobiliary sub-type IPMN that mirror these gene expression differences. In this
project, we will utilize this spatial platform to expand our work and identify sub-type specific
epithelial markers of high-grade dysplasia. We will then assess cyst fluid for these proteins using
a novel proteomics platform (Olink Focus), and further develop a prediction model for high-risk
disease (validated during the previous project period, AUC approximately 0.8). Finally, we will
attempt to rapidly validate this model(s) by applying the model(s) to two separate cyst fluid
repositories developed by our group that contain cyst fluid from hundreds of patients who have
been managed for pancreatic cysts - and have mature follow-up. We believe this approach will
allow us to identify very specific cyst fluid protein markers to both epithelial sub-type and grade of
dysplasia and develop a very accurate test for high-risk IPMN. Patients with IPMN represent a
population in which the identification of accurate markers of high-grade dysplasia will allow for
curative intervention (resection) prior to the development of an incurable disease, while sparing
those with low-grade lesions the morbidity – and even mortality – of operation."
10735877,"Behavior is organized across multiple spatial and temporal scales, ranging from 
sub-second motor commands over multi-second movement plans to long term foraging patterns. 
Currently it is unclear how the brain solves this coordination of multiple intertwined 
temporal demands. While classical neuroscience experiments typically look at or engage a 
fixed temporal scale or horizon, ethological studies have long focused on the analysis of 
naturalistic behavior across freely elicited temporal scales. Here we will use novel developed deep 
learning pose estimation approaches to study the behavior and associated single unit physiology of 
foraging behavior in freely moving rhesus macaques. First we will establish that timescales of 
macaque pose behavior encode cognitive variables such as reward expectation. Second we will 
establish the link between neural and behavioral timescale coordinating in the decision to 
action axis of the medial prefrontal wall leading to the anterior cingulate cortex by 
recording multi-region wireless electrophysiology in freely moving rhesus macaques. Third, 
 using embedding and connectivity analysis we will uncover the mechanisms for inter and intra areal 
timescale coordination to understand how the brain balances temporal scale demands."
10735879,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Projects like the BRAIN initiative hold the potential for a fundamentally new approach to therapeutics for
severe mental illness. Neuromodulation technologies promise to allow selective intervention in which
pathophysiology is specifically targeted for correction. These initiatives are critically dependent on the correct
identification of circuit dysfunction that causes psychiatric symptoms. NIMH has prioritized this as a strategic
objective: Identify and characterize the neural circuit mechanisms contributing to human behavior and their
disruption in mental illnesses.
 Neuroimaging studies have generated promising leads while almost never demonstrating that these
findings represent targets that can be engaged for therapeutic benefit. We thus lack a key perquisite for
translation into the clinic: For imaging biomarkers to make the leap to translational use, they would need to
accurately identify the circuits that give rise to symptoms.
 In this project we seek to understand how brain circuit dysfunction causes auditory hallucinations in
schizophrenia. Published, technically challenging imaging studies provide a critical clue: These “symptom
capture” experiments that collect MRI imaging during hallucinations have identified a disparate pattern of
activations across multiple subcortical and cortical brain regions. Our hypothesis is that these brain regions
are part of a single circuit than spans cerebellar, thalamic, and cortical brain regions. In our preliminary data we
are able to identify the cerebellar node of this circuit, and then, in an independent cohort of participants with
schizophrenia, we used neuromodulation to manipulate this circuit. We observe that non-invasive
neuromodulation can manipulate connectivity across this entire circuit. Restoration of connectivity in this circuit
is reflected in reduction of hallucination severity.
 In this proposal we seek to confirm and extend this result. We will use non-invasive neuromodulation to
specifically target this circuit and observe change induced on the hallucination circuit in a sham-controlled
study. If successful, this project will establish a circuit-level understanding of how pathophysiology is causally
linked to hallucinations. This kind of mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia symptoms would be
unprecedented and would identify biological target for engagement to reduce these symptoms."
10735880,"Infections during pregnancy or the neonatal period account for more than two million deaths globally each year.
Frequently, the pathogens causing these infections begin as residents of the maternal vaginal microbiota and
ascend to the uterus during pregnancy. One such pathogen, group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a leading agent
of neonatal morbidity and mortality with conservative approximations attributing GBS to 147,000 stillbirths and
infant deaths annually. The primary sources of neonatal GBS exposure are thought to be the maternal vaginal
tract during labor and delivery or in utero GBS invasion of placental barriers resulting in fetal infection. Women
with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a 20-50% increased risk for GBS neonatal sepsis and maternal
invasive disease but mechanistic insight is lacking. While prophylactic antibiotics have decreased the risk of GBS
disease in the first week of life, incidence of GBS-induced stillbirth and preterm birth remains unimproved and
early exposure to antibiotics has long-term health consequences that are yet to be fully elucidated. Thus,
alternative preventative and therapeutic options are urgently needed and can only be achieved by deepening
our understanding of GBS pathogenesis. The aim of this proposal is to determine mechanistic factors that render
gestational diabetic hosts uniquely susceptible to GBS. To do so, I have developed an in vivo model of GBS
ascension in the reproductive tract of gestational diabetic mice. Preliminary data suggests that this model exhibits
increased risk of fetal GBS infection in gestational diabetes as seen in humans. Using this novel model of in
utero GBS dissemination in gestational diabetic mice, I will characterize how gestational diabetes alters GBS
virulence and host immunity in the maternal reproductive tract. I hypothesize that gestational diabetic conditions
perturb host immunity and increase GBS virulence. This hypothesis will be interrogated through specific aims
designed to determine: 1) The impact of gestational diabetes on host immunity and 2) the GBS genes that are
critical for uterine ascension in healthy and gestational diabetic pregnancy. These novel and advanced aims use
multiple innovative tools including a recently established murine model of in utero GBS dissemination in GDM
mice and utilization of mice that harbor a humanized microbiome to explore the role of reproductive tract
microbiota in shaping local immunity against GBS. The breadth of work, mentorship and training plan outlined in
this proposal will equip the candidate with the necessary expertise in mucosal immunology, bioinformatics and
reproductive pathophysiology to achieve independence as a physician-scientist with an exciting career trajectory
in the field of pediatrics. Together, this research proposal seeks to inform novel therapeutic strategies to better
protect maternal-fetal health while advancing our current viewpoint on the complex interplay of gestational
diabetes, immunity, local microbiota and GBS virulence in the maternal reproductive tract."
10735882,"Project Abstract.
The goal of this project is to introduce a new synthetic strategy to functionalize pyridine heterocycles. Pyridines
are the second most common nitrogen heterocycle found in FDA approved drugs, an unsurprising fact because
of their propensity for hydrogen bonding and suite of valuable physiochemical properties such as aqueous
solubility, net polarity, and resistance to oxidative metabolism. Synthetic methods to directly and selectively
functionalize pyridines are critical in drug discovery efforts because drug-developers require variation in
positional selectivity, various carbon- and heteroatom bearing groups on the scaffold a wide variance in their
steric and electronic properties. However, general approaches to transform pyridine C–H bonds into valuable
derivatives are lacking. In this proposal, we outline a dearomatization strategy by converting pyridines into Zincke
imine and iminium adducts. In effect, these adducts make pyridines react like a series of alkenes rather than an
aromatic system and thus open up the plethora of reactions associated with olefins that were previously
ineffective on pyridines themselves. We will show that pyridines can now participate in numerous processes,
such as halogenation, reaction with sp2-carbon electrophiles radical reactions that were either not viable or
operated under extreme reaction conditions. The processes will occur with exclusive control of regioselectivity
for the 3-position of Zincke intermediates and are also switchable to the 5-position based on the Zincke adduct's
structure. The ring-opening-functionalization-ring-closing is sequencable into one-pot processes in many cases.
We will also use the Zincke platform to access pyridine isotopologs for ADME studies and new methods to form
N–oxides. We plan to employ this strategy for simple building block pyridines, drug-like intermediates and for
late-stage functionalization of complex pyridine-containing drugs."
10852802,"Targeting posttranslational modification of CD73 in TNBC
The goal of this project is to determine the impact of proteolytic regulation of CD73 by the E3 ligase TRIM21 in
breast carcinogenesis and as a therapeutic target in breast cancer. CD73 is a multifunctional ectoenzyme
affecting both tumor cells and immune cells. Elevated tumor expression of CD73 is tightly correlated to poor
prognosis in various types of cancers, especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Furthermore, abnormal
accumulation of CD73 is thought to interfere with both chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and contribute to
tumor evasion/progression/metastasis and drug resistance. It is unclear whether the pathological accumulation
of CD73 in TNBC is caused by impaired regulation of protein turnover. We recently purified the CD73 protein
complex, which led to the identification of TRIM21 as a ubiquitin E3 ligase that governs CD73 ubiquitylation and
degradation. We found that TRIM21-facilitated proteolysis of CD73 determines an abundance threshold above
which adenosine signal-mediated T cell proliferation and activity regulates tumor invasion. In co-cultures of
TNBC cells and activated CD8+ T cells, depletion of TRIM21 or stabilization of CD73 in TNBC cells led to
elevation of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in significant suppression of T cell expansion
and enhanced T cell exhaustion. We further demonstrated that disruption of TRIM21-mediated CD73
ubiquitylation in a preclinical animal model led to tumor progression associated with an increase in adenosine
signaling by the tumor and inhibition of T cell proliferation/function. These data suggest that TRIM21 is a critical
player that determines CD73-mediated tumor evasion and invasion, and that manipulation of CD73 turnover may
be a novel therapeutic strategy that could be combined with current FDA-approved TNBC treatment regimens.
In this proposal, we aim to determine the pathophysiological role of CD73 ubiquitylation by TRIM21 in TNBC
progression through modulation of tumor immunity, and to examine the clinical relevance of the TRIM21-CD73
axis in TNBC therapy. We will test the hypothesis that loss of TRIM21-mediated CD73 degradation affects
tumor immunity to promote TNBC tumor evasion/progression and inhibit cancer therapeutic efficacy, and that
modulating the TRIM21-CD73 axis will reverse these processes in TNBC. We propose the following specific
aims to test this hypothesis: (1) Determine the mechanism by which TRIM21 regulates CD73-mediated tumor
immunity; (2) Determine the physiological relevance of CD73 ubiquitylation by TRIM21 in regulating tumor
immunity; and (3) Determine the relevance of the TRIM21-CD73 axis in anti-TNBC treatment in various
preclinical animal models."

Macrophage Immunosuppression by Quorum-Induced Streptococcus pyogenes
The human-restricted pathosymbiont Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS) uses the
Rgg2/Rgg3 QS system to modify the bacterial surface, allowing coordination of biofilm formation and lysozyme
resistance. Preliminary findings demonstrate that innate immune cell responses to GAS are substantially altered
by the QS status of the bacteria. Published and preliminary data show that macrophage activation, stimulated
by multiple agonists and assessed by cytokine production and NFB activity, was substantially suppressed upon
interaction with QS-ON GAS but not QS-OFF bacteria. Neither macrophage viability nor bacterial adherence
were seen as different between QS activity states, yet TNF, IL-6, INF levels and an NFB reporter were
drastically lower when QS was ON. Suppression required contact between viable bacteria and macrophages. A
QS-regulated biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in the GAS genome, encoding several putative enzymes, was
also required for macrophage modulation. Newly acquired transcriptomic analysis (RNA-Seq) of macrophages
infected with QS-ON and QS-OFF GAS indicate clear divergence in gene expression patterns between infection
types. QS-OFF infections induce macrophage characteristics with signatures of classic activation (M1-like),
whereas QS-ON infections produced genetic signatures consistent with alternatively activated (M2-like)
macrophages, where metabolic pathways of oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid beta-oxidation are induced.
We propose a model that upon contact with macrophages, QS-ON GAS produce a BGC-derived factor capable
of suppressing inflammatory responses. The suppressive capability of QS-ON GAS is abolished after treatment
with a specific QS inhibitor. These observations suggest that interfering with the ability of bacteria to collaborate
via QS can serve as a strategy to counteract microbial efforts to manipulate host defenses. This application
seeks to accomplish three primary objectives: 1) identify the QS-regulated factor generated by the BGC and the
biosynthetic intermediates; 2) identify the macrophage target and mechanism of NFB inhibition; and 3) evaluate
the physiological impact on immune cell activity and the advantage provided to GAS in vivo and in human explant
tissue models."
10879111,"About 80% of Americans experience periodontitis in their lifetime. Alveolar bone loss leads to loosening or loss
of teeth or dental implants that disrupts the most basic daily functions, such as eating and speaking. Various
bone grafts are being used to restore alveolar bone loss, but poor prognosis remains a long-standing problem.
Autografts are considered the gold standard, but these grafts exhibit significant volume loss in inflammatory
conditions. The available amount of material for autografts is limited, and surgical harvesting procedures are
often complex and associated with morbidity, pain, and infection at the donor site. Allografts and xenografts have
less bone formation capacity than autografts, while they are also associated with risks of infection, disease
transmission, and immunological rejection by the host. Synthetic bone grafts such as hydroxyapatite (HAP) and
beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) have also been widely used, mostly in granule or block form. However, none
of the existing synthetic bone graft materials exhibit sufficient bone formation capacity to restore inflammatory
alveolar bone loss to pre-disease levels. There is a significant unmet medical need for the development of a
next-generation bone implant that can effectively regenerate alveolar bone in chronic inflammatory conditions.
Alveolar bone almost never spontaneously regenerates in the presence of chronic inflammation. Excess
inflammation destroys tissues and supports the growth of pathogens leading to the realization that effective
control of microbiome dysbiosis in periodontitis cannot be achieved without effective control of inflammation.
Inflammation can be resolved by specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) that can rapidly restore tissue
homeostasis to stop the negative feedback loop of infection-inflammation and boost bone regeneration. SPMs
effectively regulate inflammation in utero through early childhood, but their production and effectiveness diminish
with age. In many instances, chronic inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis are associated with a failure
of natural resolution pathways. Here, we aim to develop an innovative 3D printed customized biomimetic and
immunomodulatory alveolar bone implant that can provide targeted key biological factors for inflammation
modulation and bone regeneration. We will use whitlockite (WH) nanoparticles, the second most abundant bone
mineral in humans with excellent bone formation capacity, to develop SPM-delivering bone-mimetic ink material
for 3D printing a customized, personalized bone implant that can stably fit into alveolar bone defects to effectively
resolve inflammation and boost bone regeneration. During this research project, we will establish a novel
bioengineering process for preparing this innovative alveolar bone implant that can later be used by clinicians.
The therapeutic effectiveness of the SPM-delivering bone-mimetic implant will be evaluated in a periodontitis
model with alveolar bone loss. We envisage that the proposed biomimetic immunomodulatory 3D printed bone
implant will significantly improve alveolar bone regeneration in severe inflammatory periodontitis or peri-
implantitis and lead to a breakthrough in the treatment of non-healing inflammatory skeletal defects."
10877007,"Medical diagnosis is a critical component of effective health care but misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis and incorrect triage
is common especially in urgent or emergency care settings, and a major contributor to adverse clinical events. While
improvements in health care are important in addressing misdiagnosis, patients have a key role by recognizing potentially
serious symptoms and seeking care in a timely manner. These concerns are of particular importance for patients requiring
urgent or emergency care with potentially life-threatening diseases, such as transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke or
myocardial infarction. They often fail to recognize the seriousness of their symptoms and may fail to seek care promptly,
resulting in missed treatments and poorer outcomes. Patients with stroke typically must be treated within 4 hours to
achieve a good response, and public education campaigns have not significantly helped. Smartphone apps for medical
diagnosis termed Symptom Checkers (SCs) are widely available to patients in the US and worldwide. They have been
shown to be usable by patients, and can affect patient decision making and care seeking behavior. Evidence from our work
and others has shown that, if used correctly, SCs can achieve accuracy of diagnosis and triage close to that of physicians
(relying on symptom data). However, most studies are based on case summaries created by physicians, SC apps are not
used by patients, and lack evidence on the effects of patient characteristics, or SCs influence on patient decision making.
 To address these gaps we will evaluate the safety, usability, diagnostic and triage accuracy of a leading symptom checker
in use by patients in an emergency department or urgent primary care, and the effect of SC outputs on patients’ decisions
to seek care. In aim 1 we will recruit 700 patients to use a SC app from Ada Health when they are seen in urgent primary
care or the emergency department at Rhode Island Hospital (RIH), including those with possible symptoms of TIA or stroke.
This builds on our previous studies of the Ada SC with 241 patients recruited in these locations. The level of urgency of
care they intend to seek will be assessed before and after use of Ada, along with a questionnaire on app usability.
Diagnostic and triage accuracy will compared to the assessment of the physician who saw the patient, and the Ada results
both compared with, and critiqued by, independent physicians viewing the symptom data collected by Ada. We will also
evaluate the effects of different presentations of diagnosis and triage data on patient decision making.
 In aim 2 we will utilize 2 unique data sets of 2300 patients with possible TIA or stroke seen in the ED at RIH, and use
machine learning techniques to create new algorithms to improve early diagnosis and risk stratification. Performance will
be compared with existing algorithms and guidelines on accurate diagnosis and effective management of these conditions.
We will also analyze a data set of 158,000 patients with possible TIA or stroke who used the Ada app in a community
setting, and evaluate the influence of patient characteristics, including age, sex, race, ethnicity, country, and socio-
economic group on their symptoms, comparing this to the RIH data set results. The results of these studies will improve
our understanding of symptom checker safety, ability to recognize high risk patients and direct them to seek care, and the
potential impact on health service use, for a broad range of patients including those with TIA or stroke."

Sensory hair cells of the inner ear experience continuous mechanical and metabolic stress. The maintenance of
hair cells is further challenged by damage from a variety of other ototoxic factors, including loud noise, aging,
genetic defects, and ototoxic drugs. Because mammalian auditory hair cells do not regenerate, the repair of hair
cell damage is important for continued auditory function. Our research program is especially interested in
molecular processes involved in the maintenance of the stereocilia filamentous (F)-actin core. Recent studies
have concluded that the stereocilia actin core is stable over months, implying that any structural damage must
be actively repaired. The stereocilia F-actin core can sustain damage, most notably by noise exposure, which
was shown to cause “gaps” in phalloidin labeling of F-actin in stereocilia. In preliminary studies, we found that
these gaps are repaired in days. We therefore propose to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which
the F-actin lesions are sensed and repaired. The proposed study was inspired by an emerging concept in
mechanobiology, according to which F-actin possesses intrinsic mechanosensory properties. In this model,
mechanical strain modulates the interaction of actin filaments with effector proteins. For a variety of actin binding
proteins, their constitutive binding to F-actin is merely tuned by force. A subset of LIM domain proteins however
are unique in that mechanical strain reveals previously hidden binding sites on F-actin, providing an on/off switch
for downstream processes. These processes were implicated in the recruitment of actin repair substrates and in
the prevention of F-actin fiber breakage. We reasoned that hair cells might employ a similar strategy to repair its
F-actin-based stereocilia. In our search for molecules involved in this process, we focused on proteins that are
enriched in the hair cell bundle, contain potential mechanosensor domains, and cause progressive hearing loss
in human or mice with loss of function. We identified two proteins, XIRP2 (Xin Actin Binding Repeat Containing
2) and CRIP3 (cysteine rich protein 3) that fulfill these criteria. We hypothesize that XIRP2 and CRIP3 are
mechanosensor proteins capable of sensing F-actin damage and recruiting additional repair factors,
thus playing essential roles in hair cell stereocilia repair and maintenance. To test this, in SA1, we propose
to test the hypothesized mechanosensor function of XIRP2 in fibroblasts. In preliminary studies, we discovered
a novel mechanosensor domain in the C-terminus of XIRP2. We will use live cell laser ablation and cell stretch
experiments to define the mechanosensor region, and investigate the mechanisms by which XIRP2’s
mechanosensor function is regulated. In SA2, we propose to test the mechanosensor and repair function of
XIRP2 in vivo, using a mouse model that lacks the mechanosensor domain. We will also perform ex vivo
experiments to test whether fluorescently tagged XIRP2 is recruited to stereocilia lesions. In SA3, in an effort to
investigate the involvement of additional repair factor candidates, we will test the mechanosensor and repair
function of the hair bundle enriched LIM domain protein CRIP3."

 A frequent side effect of chemotherapy is infertility and female patients newly diagnosed with cancer or
other malignancies are routinely counseled to undergo controlled ovarian hyper-stimulation as a means of
fertility preservation. For pre-pubertal girls or women requiring immediate chemotherapy, ovarian
hyperstimulation is unavailable and many of these patients opt to cryopreserve ovarian tissue with
subsequent auto-transplantation once in remission. The increasing frequency of ovarian tissue
cryopreservation (OTC) portends a surge in future demand for auto-transplantation, yet the
viability/function of grafts is significantly undermined by post-transplant ischemia. Moreover, the iatrogenic
influence of chemotherapeutic agents and/or the inflammatory milieu present following tissue auto-
transplantation upsets the inter-follicular homeostasis that governs healthy ovarian physiology. We have
developed an approach that utilizes cultured vascular cells to accelerate perfusion of transplanted ovarian
tissue. In addition, we have demonstrated the potential for an ovary-specific secreted factor, anti-Müllerian
hormone (AMH), to modulate follicular growth and activation. The goals of this proposal are to combine
these technologies to enhanced tissue viability and follicular output in the context of auto-transplantation
and/or mitigate the negative influence of chemotherapeutic agents on the ovary in situ. The proposal aims
to address this burgeoning unmet need by: 1) improving viability and output of ovarian tissue grafts by co-
transplanting patient-matched vascular endothelial cells isolated at the time of OTC; 2) manipulating
signaling within the graft site at the time of ovarian tissue transplantation to repress premature follicular
mobilization; and 3) mitigating the gonadotoxic influence of alkylating chemotherapy via pre-conditioning of
ovarian tissue with AMH. In pursuing these goals, the proposal stands to improve outcomes for thousands
of women who have undergone or will undergo OTC, while also aiming to forego in future patients the risk,
expense, pain, and uncertainty of OTC and auto-transplantation."

The mammalian hypothalamus plays a critical role in behaviors essential for survival. The lateral hypothalamic
area (LHA) occupies 55% of the hypothalamus and contains diverse neuron types, yet remains an
undifferentiated region in mouse atlases. Much remains unknown about its structural and functional organization
at the regional, cell-type specific, and individual neuron scales. Further, the hypothalamus is structurally and
functionally sexually dimorphic, yet differentiated brain atlases for the sexes is absent. We hypothesize that
multiscale heterogeneity of LHA structural organization underlies the specificity and properties of its cell type-
specific circuit functional organization. We will investigate this using established and innovative approaches to
correlate and synthesize molecular, cellular, and circuit-level LHA data into a multimodal, multiscale LHA
reference atlas. In Aim 1, we will construct a multiscale, multimodal, 3D reference atlas of the male and female
mouse hypothalamus based on the cyto- and chemoarchitecture of the LHA (Aim 1a). These volumetric 3D
lightsheet data will be registered to the Allen CCF and structural delineations will be conducted using a novel
cloud-based 3D approach. In Aim 1b, we will use our connectivity-based parcellation strategy to refine the
delineation of the LHA at a much higher granularity based on the systematic analysis of >300 sets of pre-collected
neural pathways and additional connectivity data collected via conditional (Cre-dependent) viral pathway tracing
methods. The refined parcellation of LHA subdivisions will be validated by investigating specificities of their
input/output organization. In Aim 2, we will systematically investigate LHA molecular diversity and network
organization across meso- and microscale resolutions. First, for each LHA subdivision, we will investigate the
molecular identities of target-specific GABA and GLU projection neurons by combining retrograde pathway
labeling with RNAscope or HiPlex RNAscope (Aim 2a). Then, for these target-specific GABA & GLU neuron
types, we will systematically examine their axon collateralizations (Aim 2b) and neural inputs (Aim 2c) using a 2-
way viral labeling method in Vgat-Cre and Vglut2-Cre knock-in mice. Finally, in Aim 2d, by combining a novel
genetic sparse labeling method (MORF) with brain clearing, 3D microscopic imaging, and computational
reconstruction algorithms, we will reconstruct the fine detailed single neuron morphology (dendrites and axons)
of >2000 GABA and GLU neurons in male and female LHA. All of the data will be registered into the newly
constructed 3D hypothalamic atlas (Aim 1) within the CCF to construct an unprecedentedly comprehensive
cellular atlas of the male and female hypothalamus. In Aim 3, we will establish a computational platform and a
specialized computational infrastructure for (1) circuit, neuronal, and synaptic reconstruction, annotation, and
error correction validated with efficient ground truth human assessments; and (2) for efficient data transfer,
storage, and dissemination. All CCF-registered neuronal morphology and connectivity data will be processed
and disseminated through our UCLA BRAIN data portal."

Multiple organ dysfunction is the most common cause of death in injured patients who do not die from brain
injury or uncontrolled hemorrhage. Older patients are at highest risk for morbidity with reduced probability to
return to productive life after trauma and shock. Current therapy is symptomatic without addressing the
underlying mechanisms for the increased morbidity seen in aged individuals. In the past, we advanced the
revolutionary idea that multiorgan dysfunction after trauma/shock is due to leak of the powerful digestive
enzymes across the intestinal mucosal barrier systemically. Specifically, enteral blockade of digestive proteases
in multiple forms of acute shock and sepsis significantly reduces diverse cell dysfunctions, morbidity and
mortality; this intervention is currently being tested in FDA-approved Phase III clinical trial after completion of
multiple successful Phase II studies in cardiac and gastrointestinal surgery patients. In this application we
hypothesize and provide preliminary results that demonstrate chronic escape of digestive enzymes in old
animals from the bowel into systemically, with subsequent infiltration into peripheral organs. Digestive enzymes
cleave extracellular matrix proteins and membrane receptors, causing cell and organ dysfunctions in the old.
When exposed to trauma/shock, the old are subjected to acute leak of digestive enzymes (just like the young)
but in addition, must contend with a chronically accumulated digestive enzyme load in their tissues, leading to
significantly increased multiorgan dysfunction after shock. Our Overall Objective is to use pretreatment of old
rats with inhibitors of digestive enzymes prior to acute trauma/shock to reduce their high level of multiple organ
dysfunction and mortality. Our Specific Aims are to
(1) determine the accumulation and activities of digestive enzymes in tissues outside the gastrointestinal tract of
old versus young rats of both genders. Preliminary results indicate that aged animals have significantly increased
levels of digestive enzymes in peripheral tissues and consequently reduced organ function.
(2) measure the protease activity and organ dysfunction in the old after treatment with digestive enzyme
inhibitors. Our rationale is that one-week blockade of digestive enzymes with competitive inhibitors at low level
(µM) reduces their activity in tissues outside the intestine and improves cell and organ function without
significantly affecting digestive enzyme activity and digestion inside the small intestine (at mM concentrations).
(3) determine multiorgan dysfunction and mortality after trauma/shock in pretreated old animals with attenuated
digestive enzyme activity in their tissues outside the intestine.
Our studies will bring to light a new mechanism for development of organ and cell dysfunction in the old that
is translatable to humans. We will determine the first time the accumulation and temporal activity of digestive
enzymes (including, but not limited to serine protease, lipase, amylase) in tissues outside the intestine, develop
new approaches to attenuate their activity and reduce multiorgan dysfunction upon exposure to trauma/shock."
10909282,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite continual improvement in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), achieving mucosal
healing remains difficult for many patients with IBD. A key hallmark of IBD is a compromised mucosal barrier
leading to erosions and ulcerations of the epithelium, which result in increased epithelial permeability and
uncontrolled immune response that induce and maintain intestinal inflammation. A healed and intact mucosa is
essential for preventing bacterial translocation from the lumen and modulating immune response to regain
intestinal homeostasis. However, limited success has been achieved for complete mucosal healing, likely due
to premature loss of drug efficacy and the off-target effect in normal tissue. Moreover, there remains a lack of
clear understanding on the complex healing process of the inflamed mucosa. Under chronic inflammation, how
the immune system and the microbiota may interfere with epithelial repair, thereby hindering healing, is largely
unknown. Therefore, there is a critical need for strategies that can target the inflamed mucosa to identify key
mediators in epithelial repair and promote healing. Without such strategies, mucosal healing will continue to be
a “therapeutic ceiling”. To address this challenge, we propose to engineer a biomaterial-based biomimetic
system that can selectively target the inflamed mucosa and locally release therapeutics to the
damaged epithelium. This system comprises a polymer-based hydrogel and drug-loaded nanoparticles
(NPs)—a hydrogel will create an interface at the inflamed mucosa, acting as a synthetic mucus layer, and the
NPs will release drugs locally to suppress bacteria, resolve inflammation, and repair the epithelium. Our
previous study showed that negatively charged hydrogels preferentially adhered to the inflamed mucosa based
on charge-mediated interaction in murine models of colitis and IBD patient biopsies. This proposed research
will combine the charge-based interaction with sol-to-gel transition using functionalized thermo-responsive
polymers to enhance the selective targeting. The NPs provide a platform for loading different drugs or drug
combinations to tackle the complex healing process at the site of inflammation. The overall objective of this
project is to maximize healing of the inflamed mucosa, enabled by drug delivery mimicking the natural mucosal
barrier and uncovering key mediators that regulate epithelial repair. The rationale is that determining
therapeutic efficacy of our biomimetic drug delivery system in preclinical models of IBD will provide a strong
scientific framework whereby new approaches to maximize mucosal healing can be developed. In this project,
we will pursue three specific aims: 1) a polymer-based synthetic mucus layer will be characterized and
optimized, 2) combinatorial NP drug delivery will be used to detect key mediators regulating epithelial repair,
and 3) therapeutic efficacy and mucosal healing by the drug-loaded biomimetic system will be determined.
These results will have a significant impact on repairing the mucosal barrier at the luminal-epithelial interface in
IBD, which may also open new horizons for treatment of many other mucosal barrier disorders."

 This basic science grant seeks to determine fundamental mechanisms as to how a physiologically relevant
cell controls the subcellular location of a signal to optimize the effect of that signal on cell function. We propose
to build on recent findings by our diverse investigative team to delineate how 3 different Gs-coupled receptors in
airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells - the 2AR, EP2, and EP4 receptors- have their signals compartmentalized
within the cell to regulate important ASM cell functions. Aim 1 will employ novel imaging approaches to delineate
spatiotemporal features of cAMP/PKA signaling by each receptor and demonstrate how this compartmentalized
signaling is shaped by receptor-specific complements of AKAP and PDE isoforms, and by the competing co-
activated Gq-coupled receptor. Aim 1 will also employ multiple subcellular-targeted biosensors to characterize
the capacity of each receptor to signal from intracellular membrane compartments. Aim 2 will assess how these
different receptors generate unique phosphoproteome signatures, and how manipulating the mechanisms
shaping localized cAMP/PKA signaling regulates these signatures. Aim 3 will establish how the mechanisms
dictating spatiotemporal features of ASM cAMP and the ASM proteome affect Gs-coupled GPCR regulation of
ASM contraction, migration, and synthetic functions. The proposed studies will provide a foundation for
understanding compartmentalized signaling in the form of both methodological advances and the knowledge
gained in how Gs-coupled receptors employ distinct signaling mechanisms to render efficient and specific
functional effects. From a translational perspective, our findings will constitute a critical basic science foundation
for developing new drugs that target mechanisms of signaling compartments, most readily applied to better
control asthma features such as airway hyperresponsiveness, airway remodeling, and possibly airway
inflammation."

HIV and AIDS continue to be significant public health issues, but with recent advances in treatment,
technology, clinical and social support, the research and treatment agenda now explicitly and
realistically includes bringing the decades-long pandemic to an end. The President’s Emergency Plan
for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is an ongoing multi-billion investment to deliver antiviral therapy to those in
low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), and has been regarded by many as the most successful public
health intervention in modern history, having dramatically reduced both prevalence and incidence of
HIV over the past two decades. With both clinical trials and observational studies conclusively
demonstrating that immediate treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the mosteffective way to
both treat HIV and prevent the transmission of new infections, retention in HIV care and suppression
of viral load through compliance with ART are arguably the most effective methods available for
bringing the pandemic to an end, and indeed are encoded in the UNAIDS 95-95-95 benchmarks of
having 95% of cases diagnosed; 95% of diagnosed cases initiated and retained on ART; and 95% of
treated individuals achieving viral suppression.
Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) tailored to the requirements of LMICs have been shown to
improve compliance with guidelines and quality of care by a range of healthcare staff. Use of machine
learning algorithms allows the development of prediction models for clinical complications and
outcomes, which can guide health care staff in early identification of problems and appropriate
interventions. The Specific Aims of this proposal therefore are (1) to use a large electronic health
record (EHR) database to develop and validate statistical machine learning models to identify patient
at high risk for loss to follow up and viral failure; (2) to develop and field test implementation of clinical
decision support tools based on these models that will be implemented at the point of care; and (3) to
evaluate the efficacy of the decision support tools, in terms of improving patient retention and reducing
viral failure, using a randomized comparison at the clinic level. Our project will be implemented at the
Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH), an HIV care program in western Kenya
serving nearly 200,000 people with HIV."

 Tissue stem cells stem cells of the epidermis protect us from external insults, grow hair, and repair wounds.
Extensive characterization of epidermal stem cells (IFE-SCs) and hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) has uncovered
how their transcriptional and signaling pathways regulate regeneration. Far less is known about how stem cells
incorporate metabolic inputs, which can profoundly affect the balance between proliferation and differentiation.
When regeneration is slowed in wound repair, it can be detrimental and lead to hyperproliferative states
associated with inflammation and malignancy. Therefore, a knowledge of how metabolism impacts the
regenerative capabilities of stem cells will fill a critical knowledge gap and an unmet and pressing need for new
ways to promote tissue regeneration and wound repair. Furthermore, it may provide novel avenues to curb
inflammation and metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs).
 Serine is an attractive candidate for therapeutic intervention, as we know that SCC cells become addicted to
serine uptake to avoid serine biosynthesis and production of the metabolite a-ketoglutarate (aKG). To be able
to clinically translate these findings, we must understand how serine impacts normal HFSCs and their two
regenerative processes: 1) HF regeneration, which involves lineage specification, and 2) wound healing, where
HFSCs re-epithelialize epidermis and undergo a fate switch to the IFE-SC lineage. These two processes entail
different stem cell fate decisions and demonstrate different responses to histone modifications. Given the
importance of aKG in regulating histone modifications and its accumulation upon exogenous restriction of serine,
I hypothesize that serine metabolism controls stem cell fate decisions in both wound healing and hair
regeneration via aKG-dependent histone demethylase enzymes (KDMs).
 My preliminary data demonstrated a striking acceleration in wound repair upon dietary serine/glycine
restriction, which results in increased de novo serine biosynthesis. I also observed a marked reduction in the
histone mark H3K27me3, implicating activation of aKG-dependent KDMs. Thus, in Aim 1, I will first test whether
dietary serine and glycine restriction controls HF regeneration. In Aim 2, I will test whether the effects of serine
and glycine restriction on HF regeneration and wound repair are HFSC-autonomous. In Aim 3, I will test whether
dietary ser/gly restriction alters the histone modification and chromatin accessibility landscape and dissect the
underlying mechanism behind it. I expect these studies to 1) provide the first direct evidence of whether serine
metabolism controls endogenous stem cells during tissue regeneration, 2) inform novel therapies to promote
wound repair, and 3) enable dietary or metabolic interventions in the prevention and treatment of SCC in ways
that do not harm normal regenerative processes."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and the World. Inefficient
prediction of functional tumor neoantigens and insufficient understanding of host anti-tumor immune responses
limit optimization of immunotherapeutic approaches. We recently demonstrated that programmed cell death 1
(PD-1) inhibitors, which lead to durable responses in a minority of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients,
have greater efficacy in patients with charged human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B binding pockets whose tumors
harbor mutation(s) leading to what we have designated as “motif neoepitopes”. Motif neoepitopes lead to an
amino acid substitution in the second position of a nonamer (anchor for HLA-binding), generating a change in
charge from the wild type peptide in which the resultant amino acid has a charge opposite to the HLA-B binding
pocket. This substitution leads to enhanced binding affinity to the corresponding HLA-B supertype demonstrated
by in vitro competition assays. These data suggest that optimal presentation of motif neoepitopes by
corresponding charged HLA supertypes results in effective host anti-tumor immune responses in vivo.
Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination has emerged as a potential component for immunotherapy due to both its
favorable toxicity profile and its essential role in antigen-specific T cell priming and activation. We have expertise
in clinical studies evaluating a DC in situ vaccination strategy in NSCLC. In this proposal, we intend to combine
DCs as functional antigen presenting cells (APCs) with putative motif neoepitopes as an innovative vaccination
approach to enhance host systemic tumor-specific T cell responses and potentiate clinical benefits of current
immunotherapies.
We hypothesize that 1) peptides derived from motif neoepitopes are functional neoantigens in vivo that are
capable of inducing host tumor-specific immune responses, and 2) autologous DCs pulsed with motif
neoepitope-derived peptides, particularly at optimal conditions, will induce systemic activation of motif
neoepitope-specific T cells. As part of this proposal, we are analyzing multiple biospecimens collected from our
ongoing phase I trial of intratumoral injection of autologous DCs combined with PD-1 inhibition in advanced
NSCLC. Collected specimens include serial blood and tumor biopsies as well as autologous DCs. We will
evaluate whether exposing DCs to peptides derived from motif neoepitopes can induce tumor-specific T cell
activation in co-culture experiments. We will assess the binding affinity of these peptides and the corresponding
wild type peptides to their respective HLA-B supertype. We will further optimize conditions, including addition of
PD-1 blockade, to achieve optimal T cell activation by autologous DCs pulsed with motif neoepitope-derived
peptides. These studies will greatly enhance our understanding of the potential function of motif neoepitopes in
inducing host anti-tumor immune responses, and lay the foundation for future clinical investigations of motif
neoepitope-pulsed autologous DCs as a novel treatment strategy for NSCLC."

overuse, is associated with a loss of muscle membrane integrity. Resealing the disrupted sarcolemma is a
critical step needed for muscle repair. Subtypes of muscular dystrophy arise from genetic mutations that
weaken the sarcolemma, rendering it prone to disruption and requiring robust repair mechanisms. Other
subtypes of muscular dystrophy arise from genetically-driven deficits in repair proteins, and these genetic
disorders have illustrated proteins and mechanisms that contribute to membrane stability and membrane
repair. Studies of injured muscle and dystrophic muscle have uncovered phases of muscle repair, an
immediate resealing phase followed by a rebuilding phase. Sarcolemmal resealing occurs through the
formation of a cap at the site of muscle membrane disruption. We and others have shown that this cap is
enriched for annexin proteins, especially annexin A6, a modifier of muscular dystrophy. Dominant negative
annexin A6 disrupts the formation of the repair cap, through its effects on annexin assembly, leading to
excessive membrane leak and ineffective repair. The repair cap is supported by a ring of “shoulder” proteins
that serve to reinforce the resealing process, and these proteins include dysferlin, MG53, and EHD proteins.
Within the muscle cytoplasm immediately abutting sarcolemmal disruption is an active area that is enriched for
actin and the dysferlin related protein, Fer1L5. Moreover, actin polymerization is required for normal resealing.
Recent work highlighted the role of muscle rebuilding, which follows sarcolemma resealing and includes
sarcomere assembly. Through this research program, we previously demonstrated the role of ferlin proteins
and annexins in sarcolemmal resealing by optimizing high-resolution real-time visualization. We also
developed novel genetic tools to elucidate the interaction of these proteins in membrane events. We now
propose to investigate the role of resealing proteins in their interaction with the actin-rich region in Aim 1. In
Aim 2, we will examine the molecular and temporal overlap of resealing and rebuilding during muscle repair. In
Aim 3, we will use biologically active decellularized matrices to define and probe the role of extracellular
annexins in regulating cellular contributions to muscle repair in health and disease. The outcomes of this work
will discover new protein-cellular interactions to guide the pharmacology of promoting muscle repair."
10927397,"Project Summary: Stakeholder Engagement Studio Core
The National Center for Engagement in Diabetes Equity Research (National CEDER) Stakeholder Engagement
Studio (SES) Core will expand and enhance the capacity for engaging in partnered research to advance T2D
health equity. The SES Core reflects an equitable partnership between UCLA (MPI Brown) and Visión Y
Compromiso (VyC) (Core Co-Lead Cordero-Bárzaga), and builds on an established history of collaborative
community-engaged research. The core will enrich an already strong foundation of existing community
relationships and stakeholder engagement mechanisms. It will use these to leverage resources from highly
successful partnerships—between researchers, clinicians, community-based organizations (CBOs), and
community members—to spur discovery; new approaches to prevention; and the development of effective
clinical and policy interventions to reduce risk, morbidity, and mortality of T2D-related conditions in diverse
communities. In all activities, the SES Core will support the iterative development of stakeholder engagement
through the Center's activities, in collaboration with the Administrative Core (AC) and Research Consultation
Services (RCS) Core, by promoting a culture of open exchange, equity, inclusion, advocacy, and sustainability.
The SES Core will use a community engagement studio model to improve the quality and relevance of T2D
programs, projects, and research. The overall goal of the SES Core is to deliver studios on the operations and
real-world application of stakeholder engagement in research. Specifically, the SES Core will: 1. Use equitable,
partnered approaches to tailor and modify existing stakeholder engagement studio (SES) models and pilot this
adapted model to improve equity in T2D research, treatment, and prevention interventions; 2. Deliver National
CEDER SES Core services to provide multi-sector stakeholder guidance on socially-, community-, and culturally-
aligned approaches for equitable engagement of diverse communities and individuals in all phases of T2D
research, including partnered study design, recruitment and retention strategies, analysis, and dissemination; 3.
Implement strategic processes to monitor, evaluate, and improve SES services along the research continuum;
and 4. Develop and disseminate recommendations and best practices that advance the translation of
stakeholder-engaged research to achieve equity in T2DM. The SES Core will advance a national model for
partnered research that enhances the quality, rigor, and engagement of diverse communities and stakeholders
in T2D research."
10927401,"Project Summary: Research Consultation Services Core
In order to reduce diabetes-related disparities, we must authentically prioritize community concerns and
strengthen trustworthiness of our academic and healthcare systems. The overall goal of the Research
Consultation Services (RCS) Core is to support the vision of National CEDER to foster and advance community-
led and –informed T2D equity research by providing expert consultations on research methods, frameworks, and
approaches. The structure of the proposed RCS Core is informed by health equity and meaningful community
engagement models and focused on structural and social determinants of T2D. The RCS Core is designed to
complement the Stakeholder Engagement Studio Core's efforts to provide expertise on the operations and
application of stakeholder engagement in research. The RCS Core will accomplish this by providing streamlined
access to faculty and community expertise in the research and practice methodologies needed to advance equity
in T2D research, including intersectionality frameworks, structural racism, implementation science and health
equity frameworks and metrics; life course methodology; mixed qualitative-quantitative methodology; pragmatic
trials and translational study designs; population health and health systems approaches; system dynamics
models; and legal, societal and ethical considerations in research. The RCS Core will coalesce this
multidisciplinary expertise across three collaborative resources (i.e. RCS resource pillars): (a) Community
Engagement Frameworks and Approaches (CEFA) (b) Social and Structural Determinants and Translational
Research Methods (STRM), and (c) Ethical Engagement & Dissemination in Diverse Populations (EDD). The
RCS aims to 1) refine a research consultation model that provides expertise in the theoretical frameworks,
research methodologies, and dissemination approaches needed to advance diabetes equity; 2) provide expert
consultations in theoretical frameworks, research methodology and approaches designed to support stakeholder
engagement in research and advance diabetes equity, 3) Monitor and evaluate the impact of research
consultation services on equitable and enhanced engagement of diverse communities and sectors in T2D
research; and 4) disseminate tools, recommendations, and lessons learned from RCS core service delivery. The
RCS Core is co-led by Drs. Earle Chambers and Carmen Isasi, and Ms. Chris Norwood, who bring together
more than two decades of leadership in diabetes research and practice and in building T2D research
infrastructure with an emphasis on diversity of research teams and equity in practice. The RCS Core will also
leverage institutional resources across NIH/NIDDK-funded Centers (e.g., CTSAs, CDTRs, DRCs, NORCs,
NIMHD Centers of Excellence) that are part of the National CEDER Partnership Hub, building upon active
collaborations that will generate synergistic and bidirectional collaborations to maximize resources."
10852977,"ABSTRACT – OVERALL
The induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) is
considered vital for an effective HIV vaccine. Rational vaccine design applying native Env-like trimers that target
the respective germline B cell receptor have evolved as the most promising strategy. Yet, so far, bNAb precursor
yields have not exceeded 50% of vaccinees. The goal of this Program aims to identify early determinants of
bNAb precursor induction, with a focus on the role of adjuvants and host microbiota, utilizing broad and integrated
omics approaches to decipher the mechanisms associated with bNAb development. In HIV infection, plasma
bNAbs develop in a minority of adults and only after several years, whereas bNAbs in infants with HIV can be
detected as early as one year post infection. Interestingly, bNAbs isolated from infants appear to require less
somatic hypermutations to achieve similar breadth as bNAbs of adults, implying potentially different mechanisms
of bNAb development. We present preliminary data that immunization of infant rhesus macaques (RM) with
BG505 germline-targeting (GT)1.1 SOSIP trimers adjuvanted with the TLR7,8 adjuvant 3M-052 resulted in the
induction of VRC01-like CD4 binding site bNAb precursors in 3 of 5 animals, a frequency comparable to that
observed in adult RM (6 of 12). Plasma antibodies of infant RM also targeted a broader array of epitopes
compared to adult RM, indicative of greater polyreactivity. Despite additional immunizations, the remaining 2
infant RM did not develop this neutralization signature, suggesting that early events are critical in driving bNAb
development. In infants, early immunity is partially defined by the evolving microbiota. The polyreactivity of many,
although not all, bNAbs, further supports a potential role of microbiota in bNAb development We hypothesize
that the dynamic state of the infant immune system and microbiota can be exploited to optimize the induction of
bNAbs by HIV vaccines. Leveraging the infant BG505 GT1.1 SOSIP vaccine model and applying systems
biology approaches, we will identify how the developmental pathways of bNAb induction are altered by the
modulation of the vaccine prime by different adjuvants (Project 1), the microbiome (Project 2), and the
interactions between host immunity and microbiota (Biostatistics and Computational Analysis [BCA] Core).
The Projects will be supported by the Nonhuman Primate (NHP) and the B Cell Cores, with organizational and
fiscal support by the Administrative Core. In Aims 1 and 2, we will define differences in early immune
responses and molecular signatures between vaccinees who do or do not develop bNAbs in response to BG505
GT1.1 SOSIP vaccination by modulating the vaccine prime via adjuvants (Project 1) and microbiota (Project 2).
Aim 3 will develop modeling approaches that integrate immune, microbiome, and molecular signatures to predict
the development of bnAb precursors. The results of the Program will identify critical determinants in the induction
of bNAb precursors. In future studies, we will modulate these factors to optimize HIV vaccine strategies. The
newly developed computational models will facilitate vaccine screening for the potential of bNAb development."
10852978,"ABSTRACT - Administrative Core
The Administrative Core (Admin Core) will serve to coordinate, direct, and integrate the Program’s operations,
facilitate synergy, and provide the infrastructure and oversight required to achieve the Program’s key scientific
goal of identifying the determinants of HIV broadly neutralizing antibody precursors in infant rhesus macaques.
The successful implementation and completion of this Program and its scientific goals will require a highly
efficient and responsive Admin Core. The Admin Core will be essential for the success of the Program because
it will provide 1) management of scientific projects and goals through coordination, relevant resources allocation,
and efficient data sharing and reporting; 2) coordination of financial management through close communication
and oversight; and 3) documentation of compliance, and thereby reduce the administrative burden of the
individual Program components, while guaranteeing efficiency and synergy across all Projects and Cores.
In addition, the Admin Core, with the guidance of the External Advisory Board (EAB) and NIH Program, will
provide scientific and managerial oversight over the Program’s activities to ensure that steady progress is made
towards scientific milestones. Specifically, Aim 1 of the Admin Core will provide overall coordination,
communications and data management with dedicated personnel to ensure seamless collaboration and scientific
progress and integrity. Aim 2 will ensure timely financial accounting and regulatory oversight to ensure
compliance with institutional, federal, and international guidelines.
By successfully completing its Aims, this Admin Core will ensure a unified research effort and support for the
Program’s overall goal to identify the early determinants of broadly neutralizing antibody precursor induction in
infant rhesus macaques. The Admin Core will guarantee efficient and coordinated conduct of all research
activities and ensure high relevance of research goals as the field evolves to achieve the Program goal of
optimizing HIV vaccine design for the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies."
10852979,"ABSTRACT – Nonhuman Primate Core (Core B)
The end of the HIV/AIDS epidemic will be achievable only when an effective vaccine regimen can achieve long-
term protective immunity, similar to that of vaccines that have nearly eliminated other global pathogens. The
induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against the HIV envelope (Env) is considered vital for an
effective HIV vaccine. Yet, despite the delineation of the coevolution of Env-specific antibodies and their cognate
Env intermediates from the germline BCR to bnAbs, few HIV vaccine strategies have been successful in eliciting
HIV Env Abs with broad heterologous neutralization capacity. Our knowledge about critical factors influencing B
cell differentiation and lineage commitment remains limited.
The proposed research is built on a foundation of prior research observations on the development of bnAbs in ~
50-60% of infant and adult rhesus macaques and humans immunized with germline-targeting (gt) BG505 GT1.1
SOSIP with adjuvant, and the opportunities provided by the infant RM model to define the specific biological
factors that determine B cell lineage commitment by comparing vaccinees with or without bnAb development.
Systems biology approaches can be useful to define early immune and molecular gene signatures after the
vaccine prime immunization and the role of the intestinal microbiome in vaccine-induced bnAb development.
Applying systems biology approaches, the objective of the overall studies is to determine how the modulation
of the vaccine prime by different adjuvants and vaccine delivery platforms (Project 1) and changes in the infant
microbiome (Project 2) alter the developmental pathways that lead to the induction of bnAbs. We hypothesize
that the dynamic nature of the infant immune system and microbiome can be exploited to optimize the induction
of bnAbs by HIV vaccines. These questions will be addressed via studies in the infant macaque model.
The Nonhuman Primate (NHP) Core is an integral component of the overall HIVRAD Program and
provides direct support to the Projects by coordinating and implementing all the NHP experiments
(including regulatory approvals, and all procedures related to immunizations and sample collections). This
Core has a longstanding track-record of collaboration with the 2 Project Leads/Overall P.I’s, and will
communicate frequently with both Projects and other Cores to assure all the experimental needs are met with
due diligence. The NHP Core uses the unique resources and infrastructure of the California National Primate
Research Center (CNPRC), out of which it operates, and the expertise of the Core Lead and staff. The CNPRC
is built on a service-oriented and interdisciplinary mission of advancing non-human primate models of human
diseases and translational research. Resources at CNPRC include a large rhesus macaque breeding colony,
experience with time-mated pregnancies and rearing of infant macaques, and all other procedures of
monitoring and sample collections that are essential to the successful completion of the Projects."
10844419,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The intensity of standard treatments (i.e., chemoradiation) for head and neck cancer
(HNC) has amplified over the last two decades, resulting in a 500% increase in acute toxicities. These
demanding regimens leave 90% of HNC survivors with adverse treatment effects. For some, radiation-induced
fibrosis (RIF) is progressive, leading to debilitating treatment-related effects. The most serious sequelae are
neck disability and dysphagia, which reduces QOL and survival. Our research team has empirically described
the burden and impact of neck disability and impairment in HNC survivors. Results showed that 54% of HNC
survivors reported neck disability and that increasing neck disability was associated with worsening dysphagia
symptoms. However, we know very little about the characterization of RIF and its co-occurring adverse
treatment effects trajectories (i.e., patterns of change over time), thus prohibiting the development of tailored
interventions to mitigate morbidity. Also, while reliable biomarkers to determine those at greatest risk for RIF do
not exist, our preliminary work indicates that specific circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) may be associated with
late RIF. There is a critical need to appreciate the clinical trajectories of RIF and subsequent adverse effects
and elucidate the factors underlying the development and variability in these trajectories to optimize HNC
survivors’ well-being. The purpose of this study is to determine the distinct trajectories of RIF and co-occurring
adverse treatment effects (i.e., neck disability, dysphagia) and the factors that impact those trajectories. Our
central hypothesis is that 1) substantial variability in RIF and co-occurring adverse treatment effects exist in
HNC patients receiving radiation, 2) this variability will cluster into distinct trajectories, and 3) group
membership will be explained by individual factors, cancer/cancer treatment characteristics, and miRNA
variations. This prospective study (n=334) uses a longitudinal design with assessments at pre-radiation (Time
0) and follow-up at 1 (Time 1), 6 (Time 2), 12 (Time 3), and 24 months (Time 4, exploratory) post-radiation.
Aim 1 is to characterize the trajectories of RIF and co-occurring adverse treatment effects (i.e., neck disability,
dysphagia) and their associations. In Aim 2, we will determine the individual and cancer/treatment factors that
explain variability in RIF and the co-occurring adverse treatment effects. Aim 3 will explore the trajectories of
RIF and co-occurring adverse treatment effects through 24 months post-radiation. Finally, Aim 4 will explore
circulating miRNAs associated with trajectories of RIF and co-occurring adverse treatment effects. Group-
based and dual trajectory modeling and multinomial logistic regression with model validation will be employed.
This study is essential to develop interventions to mitigate RIF and subsequent co-occurring treatment effects
HNC survivors experience to reduce morbidity, increase QOL and improve survival. Moreover, miRNAs have
the potential to serve as promising biomarkers to better determine survivors at risk for RIF before the clinical
manifestations of RIF occur and to assess therapeutic response to anti-RIF treatments."

Improving maternity care including the morbidity and mortality disparities amongst birthing people is a
national priority. U.S. professional perinatal care organizations recommend shared decision-making
(SDM) in maternity care as the way to provide person-centered, high-quality care to pregnant and
birthing people during their perinatal care; yet there is no valid and reliable measure of SDM for use by
patients. To address the SDM measurement gap, a reliable and valid measure is needed so that the
impact of SDM can be determined. The main objective of this proposal is to test the psychometric
properties of a revised previously developed measure of SDM. The measure, CHildbirth Options,
Information, and person-Centered Explanation (CHOICEs) evaluates SDM from the birthing person's
perspective and covers both prenatal and intrapartum hospital care. Pilot data provided preliminary
support for the psychometric properties of the CHOICEs items, but additional items are needed to
comprehensively measure SDM. The Revised-CHOICES and will be translated culturally and
linguistically into Spanish. To reach a representative, national sample, we will recruit 505 people who
have given birth within the previous six months through the Everyday Health apps: What to Expect, the
Baby Center, and What to Expect Español. To reach populations that do not traditionally participate in
research, we will use social networking recruitment through a community based, federally qualified
healthcare center, Mary's Center. The following aims will be addressed: Aim 1: Establish the
psychometric properties of a measure of shared decision-making in perinatal care in English
and Spanish. We will determine the score reliability, score validity and scalability of the Revised-
CHOICEs for prenatal and intrapartum care based on Rasch analysis and a Mokken non-parametric
scalability analysis. Validity testing will be conducted using Fit Indices from a Rasch analysis and
confirmatory factor analysis. Aim 2: Determine whether the shared decision-making items perform
equally across different clinical situations (first birth) and demographic groups (race, ethnicity,
age, education, income and insurance type). We will conduct statistical tests of mean differences in
scores across groups and differential item functioning (DIF) analysis based on Rasch analysis. Upon
completion of the proposed project, our expected outcome is a reliable and valid Revised-CHOICEs
measure of SDM for general use in perinatal care with instructions for interpretation of the scores.
Future research using the Revised-CHOICEs instrument will be done to focus on the impact of the use
of the measure on relevant clinical outcomes. This research aligns with AHRQ's mission to develop,
test, and evaluate meaningful person-centered measures addressing inequity and health outcomes."
10894325,"Project Summary/Abstract
Over the past three decades, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) emerged as the fastest growing cancer in the U.S.
With cure being possible in less than 10% of patients and 5 year survival rates less than 20%, attention to HCC
prevention is paramount. Large racial/ethnic disparities exist in the incidence of HCC in the U.S. where the
incidence rates are now 2-fold higher in African Americans than non-Hispanic whites. Differences in prevalence
of established HCC risk factors do not fully explain the disproportionately high HCC burden in African Americans,
and clinical interventions and policies to close these racial gaps have been largely ineffective because
fundamental questions about how this disparity arises remain unanswered. We hypothesize that host genetic
factors may predict HCC risk in African Americans and may contribute to the racial disparities in HCC incidence.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in European and Asian descent populations have been successful
in revealing common genetic risk alleles for HCC. However, germline genetics of HCC varies by the underlying
disease etiology and by genetic ancestry. To date, no HCC GWAS has been performed in African Americans. A
barrier to genetic studies of HCC in African Americans is the lack of comprehensive genetic, epidemiological and
environmental risk factor data from a large cohort of cases. We propose a GWAS of HCC in African Americans
using a proven state-wide (Texas) cancer patient contact study approach. In a case-control study, we will
investigate the relationship between common genetic variation genome-wide and the risk of HCC in African
Americans (Aim 1); these data will provide first insights into the germline genetics of HCC in an African ancestry
population. We will use independent GWAS data to validate our top hits and to perform cross-race comparisons
to assess the transferability of genetic findings across populations. It is plausible that host genetic factors may
also confer susceptibility to HCC risk among patients with cirrhosis, the precursor for HCC. Therefore, in Aim 2,
we will identify genetic risk factors for cirrhosis progression to HCC using two parallel case-control studies:
comparing cirrhosis patients with controls, and comparing HCC cases with cirrhosis patients. If variants associate
with HCC in the HCC versus control comparison (Aim 1) but not the cirrhosis versus control comparison (Aim 2),
we may also identify genetic risk factors associated with HCC in the absence of cirrhosis, a potentially growing
sub-population of HCC cases. Because early detection of HCC is critical, our last aim (Aim 3) will use information
on genetic and non-genetic risk factors to derive clinically applicable comprehensive prediction models for risk
stratification. This will be the largest study to date of HCC and cirrhosis in African Americans. Our comprehensive
evaluation of novel genetic markers underlying HCC risk in an unmatched cohort of African Americans with HCC
will have major translational implications for HCC prevention and early detection."
10851823,"Summary
The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neuroendocrine
prostate cancer (NEPC) that has the potential for translation to the clinic. NEPC is an aggressive form of
prostate cancer that is associated with rapid progression, resistance to treatments and a very poor outcome.
Currently, there are no effective therapies for treating NEPC. This revised proposal focuses on the hypothesis
that programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) has a causal role in the stemness and metastatic propensity
associated with NEPC. Although PD-L1 is best known for its role in immune suppression, its tumor cell
intrinsic functions that are independent of immune suppression can also contribute to cancer progression.
Specifically, PD-L1 has been implicated in tumor stemness, invasion and metastasis and there is
circumstantial evidence that it contributes to these functions in NEPC, although a causal role has yet to be
demonstrated. This novel function of PD-L1 can be exploited to improve the therapy of NEPC based on
compelling evidence that VEGF/NRP2 signaling sustains the expression of PD-L1 in prostate cancer.
Inhibiting VEGF/NRP2 reduces stem cell properties and promotes a more differentiated phenotype that is more
susceptible to chemotherapy, and it is likely that the mechanism involves reducing PD-L1 expression. Also, a
humanized mAb is available that inhibits the binding of VEGF to NRP2. This mAb does not cause toxicity in
mice and non-human primates and is being manufactured for use in clinical trials. Of note, this mAb diminishes
the expression of PD-L1 significantly in models of NEPC. Together, these observations formulate a central
hypothesis: PD-L1 has a causal role in NEPC by sustaining stemness and facilitating metastasis (cell
autonomous PD-L1 function) and by promoting immune cell evasion (non-cell autonomous PD-L1 function).
Both critical functions of PD-L1 can be blocked by therapeutic targeting of VEGF binding to NRP2 to improve
the morbidity and mortality associated with NEPC. The first specific aim will investigate a therapeutic strategy
for inhibiting tumor cell intrinsic functions of PD-L1 to mitigate stemness and metastasis in NEPC that involves
blocking the binding of VEGF to NRP2. The second aim will investigate therapeutic strategies that target PD-
1-dependent and PD-1-independent functions of PD-L1 in NEPC by blocking the binding of VEGF to NPR2
using immune competent models. The data generated in this proposal have the potential to provide sufficient
evidence to justify the initiation of clinical trials using NRP2 inhibitors, especially the function-blocking Abs that
are the focus of the experimental approach."
10932394,"The analysis of large datasets from computational biology and medicine represents an important chal-
lenge for Statisticians. These biomedical data typically have a large number of correlated features with rel-
atively weak signals for predicting phenotypes of interest. Examples include DNA sequences and GWAS,
mass-spectra, RNAseq and protein arrays. The broad goal of this ongoing three-investigator grant is to de-
velop and study statistical techniques that enhance the analysis and interpretation of these data. The team
combines experience in statistical modeling, algorithmic development, and theoretical analysis. Through
four Specific Aims, the new projects focus on development and validation of state-of-the art statistical
methods to use structure to learn from high-dimensional data to advance human population health.
1. Cluster-aware supervised learning. In “omics” settings, there are a large number of features that
 often exhibit sizable correlations. This aim proposes the Cluster-Aware Lasso, a statistical method
 which fits a lasso regression model that adaptively selects clusters of features using a hierarchical
 clustering-based approach, enforcing a notion of a tree-respecting solution. It will be validated on
 gene expression and mass spec data, and extensions to other supervised learning settings studied.
2. SNP Selection from GWAS summary statistics with FDR control. Genome-wide association studies
 often report findings for phenotypes in terms of summary statistics for individual SNPs. This aim
 develops a statistical method to identify causal SNPs while controlling the False Discovery Rate. It
 uses an estimate of the SNP correlation matrix based on linkage-disequilibrium data, an approximate
 multivariate lasso fit and model-X knockoff techniques, and will be validated on UK Biobank data.
3. Inference for high-dimensional genetic covariance matrices. Statistical estimation of large genetic
 covariance matrices is needed to learn whether genetic variation at phenome-wide scale is concen-
 trated in relatively few trait combinations, with implications for evolution and pleiotropy. This aim will
 explore biases in Restricted Maximum Likelihood and study alternative parametric and nonparametric
 methods of estimation both by asymptotic approximation and simulation.
4. Mixture lasso for multiple instance learning. It is often known whether a person is sick, but not which
 of their immune cells are responding to a particular illness, nor which parts of biopsied tissue are
 diseased. There is a label only for each patient, but data instances on a more granular level. The aim
 is to predict the labels of each data instance. This project proposes a supervised learning method
 based on mixtures and the lasso, with validation on viral sequence and mass spectrometry data.
 Working together, the investigators and their students will implement the new statistical tools into publi-
cally available software, following a pattern established in earlier cycles of this grant."
10894757,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Listening effort has large impact on quality of life, and thus warrants detailed and thorough study. There has
long been a conundrum over what effort is and how to measure it. We propose three new branches of work
that follow in the spirit of our previous grant cycle, building off of the key observations that listening effort is
tightly related to comprehension rather than phonetic accuracy, and that effort can emerge at distinct moments
in time before, during and after the listening process. The new aims focus on the effort of preparing to listen,
the effort of aiming attention at particular moments during listening, and the effort that lingers while a person is
comprehending the meaning of what was heard. The experiments are guided by the lived experiences of
people with cochlear implants, who regularly offer interpretation and suggestions on studies that illuminate the
situations that pose recurring problems in their daily communication. Our team of clinically trained scientists
and language/hearing experts integrates this input into rigorous designs that capitalize on our strength in
creating stimuli, measuring listening effort, and sharing our resources with the field. Different aspects of effort
need to be distinguished in order to better alleviate the associated costs. For example, effort of recovering from
mistakes is different than the anxiety of listening. Overall high overexertion could be distinguished from
exertion that simply lasts too long. The proposed work will build understanding of how effort changes on a
moment-to-moment basis before, during, and after listening, and how this is affected by hearing difficulty –
particularly the use of a cochlear implant."
10737608,"New Abstract: The causes of complex neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism remain poorly understood.   Importantly, many neuropsychiatric disorders are highly heritable, indicating the underlying cause is genetic rather than environmental.  Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to reveal specific genes associated with these disorders.  Among these, ANK3 (the gene coding for AnkyrinG (AnkG)) is potentially associated with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism.  However, how ANK3 variants contribute to these disorders remains unknown. Importantly a loss-of-function ANK3 splice variant containing a novel exon (termed BDex) found only in oligodendrocytes may be protective against bipolar disease.  We previously found AnkG in paranodes of myelinating oligodendrocytes, where it functions in the timely assembly of paranodal junctions during early development.  However, the function of oligodendroglial AnkG in older mice remains unknown.  We will determine the function of AnkG in oligodendrocytes, and more specifically the function of BDex.  We will define the precise location of BDex-containing AnkG in oligodendrocytes.  We will use loss-of-function and gain-of-function mouse models to investigate the role of oligodendroglial ANK3 variants in the brain.  We will examine node and paranode structure, myelin, myelinated axon physiology, and behavior.  Together, these studies will begin to uncover the role of oligodendroglial AnkG and BDex AnkG, and may reveal insights into the molecular pathophysiology of ANK3-associated neuropsychiatric disorders."
10916502,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heterotopic ossification (HO), a diverse pathologic process of formation of extraskeletal bone in muscle and
soft tissues, can be classified into hereditary and nonhereditary (acquired) HO types. A rare and devastating
form of hereditary HO is fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), caused by gain-of-function mutations in
Activin receptor A type I (Acvr1) gene. In the nonhereditary forms, HO frequently occurs in tendons and
ligaments and is commonly incited upon soft tissue trauma, orthopedic surgeries, combat-related blasts, and
burns. There are currently still no effective drugs to treat HO. Our long-term goal is to decipher the
mechanism(s) of HO and develop novel strategies for the clinical treatment of HO. The overall objectives are to
(i) elucidate the essential roles of cilia on the Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway and (ii)
determine its function using novel HO models. The central hypothesis is that primary cilia play central roles in
transducing normal and pathogenic BMP signaling and regulating the pathophysiological mechanism of both
hereditary and nonhereditary HO. The rationale is that both hereditary and nonhereditary HO formation are
primarily mediated by the BMP signaling pathway. However, it remains elusive where and how BMP signaling
is transduced and regulated in cells. Primary cilia are antenna-like structures protruding from the surface of
cells and are critical for proper transduction of many cellular signaling pathways. Dysfunctional primary cilia
result in a broad spectrum of human diseases collectively termed ciliopathies. Our preliminary data suggest
that primary cilia play central roles in transducing normal and pathogenic BMP signaling and regulate the
pathophysiological mechanism(s) of HO formation. The central hypotheses will be tested by pursuing these
specific aims: 1) Determine the ciliary components/pathways that govern normal and pathogenic BMP
signaling pathways. 2) Determine the regulatory function of cilia in our newly established nonhereditary
burn/tenotomy-induced HO mouse models that have abrogated ciliary signaling pathways. 3) Identify targets
for inhibition of cilium-related pathways as the basis for treatments in hereditary HO and nonhereditary HO.
The research proposed in this application is innovative because our preliminary data suggest that FOP and
perhaps other HO conditions represent cilium-mediated disorders, which provides a novel perspective for
future therapies. Mechanistically, we will systematically elucidate the function of cilia on BMP signaling
specifically as associated with HO mouse models. The proposed research is significant, and scientifically it will
build a new paradigm that primary cilium plays a central role in transducing BMP signaling in chondrogenesis
and/or osteogenesis that ultimately results in both hereditary and nonhereditary HO. Clinically, targeting the
cilia-mediated BMP pathway is an unexplored therapeutic strategy that could be applied not only for FOP but
also for other more common forms of HO, such as post-traumatic HO."
10896208,"Inotropic support for hearts progressing towards failure represents an unmet need. Direct attempts to improve
systolic function by activating -adrenergic receptor (-AR) signaling increases associated risk of heart failure
and death. Calcitropes (agents influencing Ca2+ handling) that bypass -AR signaling are not necessarily
proarrhythmic. Our working global hypothesis based on our recent and ongoing work studying RAD regulation
of the L-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC) is that bypassing -AR signaling to increase Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR)
provides safe, stable gain of function to counter heart failure progression. In this application we focus on the
mechanisms of Rad – LTCC interactions as a novel means to instill inotropic support to the heart. The LTCC is
a macromolecular hub that integrates multiple signaling pathways including protein kinase A (PKA) and Ca2+-
calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII). RAD is a member of the RGK family of monomeric G-proteins. RAD binds to
auxiliary CaV2 and CaV1.2, the pore-forming subunit of the LTCC. Deletion, or phosphorylation of RAD causes
LTCC current (ICa,L) modulation and facilitation. Modulation of ICa,L is commonly observed after -AR signaling to
activate PKA; facilitation is caused by CaMKII activation. In Specific Aim 1 we will dissect how RAD integrates
each of these signaling pathways using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches. In Specific
Aim 2 we will explore RAD – CaV1.2 structure-function using knock-in models of genetically modified mice that
allow us to explore RAD – LTCC effects retaining native stoichiometry of the LTCC heteromultimeric protein
complex. Specific Aim 3 explores RAD – LTCC interplay as an approach to attenuate progression of heart failure.
To achieve these goals, we will integrate findings among Aims using in vivo, ex vivo and cellular/molecular
approaches in animal models. Ex vivo human heart slices will be tested to evaluate the translational potential of
RAD – LTCC regulation in heart health and disease."
10914234,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The median survival in adults with repaired coarctation of aorta (COA) is ~55 years, and more that 50% of
deaths are due to end-stage heart failure and sudden cardiac death from left ventricular (LV) systolic/diastolic
dysfunction. LV dysfunction results from chronic pressure overload from hypertension, which in turn leads to
LV remodeling (increased fibrosis and stiffness, and impaired relaxation). LV dysfunction has been observed in
COA patients with borderline hypertension or stage 1 hypertension (B/S1) (blood pressure 120-139/80-89
mmHg), even though the severity of hypertension in these patients is considered significant enough to warrant
antihypertensive therapy based on the current guidelines. Additionally, COA patients with B/S1 hypertension
have impaired aerobic capacity and exhibit hypertensive response to exercise, both of which are associated
with cardiovascular adverse events The pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for LV remodeling and
abnormal hemodynamic response to exercise in this subset of COA patients are not well understood but are
postulated to be due to increased aortic stiffness. We recently demonstrated that a 2-week course of
angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) improved aortic stiffness, coronary flow reserve (CFR), cardiac output
reserve and vasodilatory reserve (VDR) during exercise. However, it is unknown whether these hemodynamic
changes will lead to LV reserve remodeling (decreased fibrosis and stiffness, and improved relaxation) and
improved aerobic capacity during long-term therapy. Our long-term goal is to prevent early cardiovascular
death in COA patients, by identifying and modifying the pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to LV
dysfunction and vascular complications in this population. Our overall objective for this application is to
determine whether ARB might promote LV reserve remodeling and improve aerobic capacity, and to delineate
the mechanisms of response to ARB. Our central hypothesis is that ARB will promote LV reserve remodeling
and improve aerobic capacity by improving CFR and VDR.
This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: (1) Determine whether ARB promotes LV reverse
remodeling in patients with repaired COA and B/S1 hypertension and delineate the mechanisms of response to
ARB; (2) Determine whether ARB improves aerobic capacity and delineate the mechanisms of response to
ARB. We will randomize 80 subjects 1:1 to ARB (losartan 50 mg) or placebo for 52 weeks. These subjects will
undergo multi-domain assessment of cardiovascular structure and function at baseline and after 52 weeks of
therapy. This proposal is innovative because it will novel magnetic resonance imaging techniques to assess
cardiovascular response to ARB in patients with repaired COA. The results will be significant because it will
enable the development of novel management paradigms for prevention of LV dysfunction and cardiovascular
death in this population."
10862768,"The perception and recognition of odors allow animals to identify food sources, avoid predators, and find
potential mates as they navigate their surroundings. These behaviors require at least three essential compu-tations: (1) the ability to discriminate between similar odors while simultaneously allowing generalization for
odor recognition; (2) acquiring and retrieving odor associations; and (3) assigning value to salient odors to
guide appropriate behaviors. Although the piriform (PCx) cortex is thought to be the locus for odor perception
and odor learning and memory, whether or how the PCx performs these essential computations remains
unknown. Our long-term goal is to mechanistically understand how odor information is processed to drive
appropriate behaviors. The objective of this proposal is to identify where and how the PCx performs these
three essential computations. The PCx has two major types of principal cells, semilunar cells (SLs) and py-
ramidal cells (PYRs), which have distinct morphologies, synaptic connectivity, and projection targets. Our
central hypothesis is that different PCx cell types play distinct and specific roles in these essential com-putations. To this end, we propose the following three aims.
Aim 1: To reveal the neural substrates of discrimination and generalization in PCx. We will train mice
to discriminate between two odorants and then record from identified SLs and PYRs as the mice are pre-sented with a morphing series of binary mixtures of the two. Our preliminary data support our hypothesis that
SLs discriminate and PYRs generalize responses to similar odors.
Aim 2: To reveal the neural substrates for acquiring and retrieving odor memories. We do not under-stand how odor memories are formed, or where and how are they stored and retrieved? We will use viral tools
with different transgenic mouse lines to selectively suppress activity in SLs or PYRs just before the acquisition
or before the retrieval phases of an odor memory task. We hypothesize that SLs are required for the acquisi-
tion but not the retrieval of odor memories, while PYRs are required for both acquisition and retrieval.
Aim 3: To determine how odor identity and value information emerge in the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC). mPFC receives direct projections from PCx and encodes odor value. We hypothesize that odor
information is directly routed from PCx to mPFC by one specific subset of PYRs (Tbr1 neurons); that
Tbr1 neurons encode odor identify but not odor value; and that the conjunction of odor identity and odorvalue
in mPFC occurs through strengthening connections between PCx Tbr1 neurons and their postsynaptic
partners in mPFC.
This study will reveal the distinct roles that different subsets of PCx neurons and circuits play in processing
odor information to guide flexible and appropriate behaviors, and can provide more general insight into how
information is transformed within and across canonical circuits throughout the brain."

 Nocturia (waking to pass urine during the main sleep period) occurs two or more times per night in
nearly 50% of older adults and is among the most bothersome urinary symptoms, due to its potentially severe
impact on sleep. However, nocturia in older adults is often viewed solely as a urological condition even though
it is also a sleep condition since it involves disturbances of the “main sleep period.” Bladder, prostate, and
antidiuretic medications, fluid restriction, bladder training, and pelvic floor muscle exercises are often
prescribed, but the effectiveness of all treatments is limited and medication side effects including delirium and
falls are concerning in older adults. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a safe, cross-specialty
treatment that will improve the lives of older adults with nocturia.
 One explanation for the high rates of nocturia despite available treatments is that current approaches
overlook non-lower urinary tract factors that contribute to nighttime awakenings. For example, cognitive
hyperarousal and decreased homeostatic sleep drive from daytime napping may increase the tendency to
arouse and sense the urge to void; and maladaptive compensatory behaviors may lead to excessive time in
bed, thereby increasing opportunity to sense the urge to void. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
effectively reduces nighttime wakefulness and early evidence suggests it also reduces nocturia. Unfortunately,
nocturia treatment crosses specialties, and delivering urological and sleep therapies in a coordinated manner
is a treatment barrier.
 The overall objective of the proposed project is to determine whether a coordinated, integrated non-
pharmacological, non-surgical treatment that simultaneously addresses both the urological and insomnia
factors contributing to nocturia is efficacious for improving nocturia, sleep, and daytime function. Results from
our NIA-supported R34 multisite planning grant demonstrate the feasibility of the novel Nocturia Insomnia
Program-Integrated Treatment (NIP-IT) program, which integrates best practice behavioral treatment strategies
for nocturia and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia components to reduce awakenings and urinary
frequency during nighttime awakenings due to other reasons. The rationale for the proposed research is that
addressing hyperarousal, conditioned responses, and maladaptive thoughts/behaviors and increasing
homeostatic sleep drive are critical to reducing nocturia frequency and nighttime wakefulness and improving
overall nocturia-related quality of life. We now propose a randomized trial (n=192) comparing NIP-IT to a
health education control program in adults aged > 60 with nocturia and insomnia symptoms to provide
rigorous, definitive evidence of the efficacy of the NIP-IT program to reduce both nocturia episodes and sleep
disturbance. We will also assess impact on nocturia and sleep-related quality of life."
10866564,"Liver cirrhosis is a major health crisis caused by chronic liver injury. Liver injury leads to fibrosis which impairs
liver function and can progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease if unchecked. Fibrosis can reverse with
removal of the injury; however, no therapeutics effectively targeted fibrosis. The major fibrogenic cells in the liver
are hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which produce and secrete matrix proteins into the extracellular space to drive
fibrogenesis. Production of matrix proteins in fibrogenic HSCs exceeds the folding capacity of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER), leading to ER stress and induction of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The UPR propa-
gates signaling cascades to increase protein folding demands, restore proteostasis, and promote cell survival
(adaptive UPR); however prolonged ER stress leads to apoptosis. We propose that targeting the adaptive
UPR in HSCs is an effective anti-fibrotic strategy, through disrupting proteostasis, promting apoptosis,
and limiting fibrogenesis. A major effector of the adaptive UPR is ATF6α. We found that ATF6α is necessary
and sufficient to promote HSC activation in vitro, and HSC-specific loss of ATF6α limited fibrogenesis in vivo;
however, the pro-fibrotic mechanisms downstream of ATF6α are unclear. To gain insight into these mechanisms,
we performed RNAseq on HSCs isolated from fibrotic Atf6aHSCΔ/Δ mice, revealing disruption of several pathways
compared to Atf6afl/fl HSCs, including pathways crucial for maintaining proteostasis through autophagy, protein
secretion, and cell survival. We hypothesize that ATF6α drives fibrogenesis through regulating proteosta-
sis in fibrogenic HSCs. Based on RNAseq as well as proteomics data from patient derived HSCs, this proposal
will focus on how ATF6α regulates proteostasis to drive fibrogenesis through three distinct mechanisms: protein
degradation, regulation of pro-survival signals, and protein trafficking. Degrading misfolded proteins is crucial for
relieving ER stress. Misfolded proteins in the ER can undergo ER-to-lysosomal associated degradation (ER-
LAD), with ERLAD receptors targeting misfolded proteins for lysosomal degradation. ERLAD activity and ERLAD
receptors increased in fibrogenic HSCs in an ATF6α-dependent manner. Aim 1 will study how ATF6α regulates
ERLAD to reduce ER stress and promote HSC survival and fibrogenesis. Second, ATF6α is crucial for survival
of secretory cells, and we show that ATF6α induces expression of GADD45A, a protein which binds to and
regulates several kinases. We show that GADD45A loss limits HSC activation in vitro, thus Aim 2 will study how
ATF6α regulates GADD45A expression and association with pro-survival kinases to promote HSC survival and
fibrogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we identified a potential role for ATF6α in procollagen I secretion through
SORT1. Aim 3 will utilize a combination of in vitro mechanistic studies, proteomics, and in vivo studies to reveal
how ATF6α regulation of SORT1 promotes procollagen I trafficking and secretion to drive fibrogenesis. Together
these studies will elucidate how ATF6α coordinates signaling mechanisms to restore proteostasis in
activated HSCs, and identify novel therapeutic targets to limit liver fibrosis in vivo."
10889277,"Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome-Like, WASL, is essential for F-actin dynamics within cells. WASL also has
fundamental, yet not well characterized, roles in transcription and epigenetic regulation in the nucleus that are
actin-dependent and actin-independent. The balance between these multifaceted roles of WASL is key in
understanding its regulatory function tying external environmental signals to cellular behavior and differentiation.
As dysregulation of these cellular processes have been tied to increased cancer invasiveness and neoplastic
cell transformation, it is essential to understand the dynamics of WASL regulation. We recently uncovered a
surprising role for WASL in regulating developmental patterning: We find that WASL is necessary for the
formation of skeletal pattern and increased WASL signaling leads to the formation of novel skeletal elements.
Importantly, we find that this patterning role for WASL is conserved across vertebrates. A developmental function
for WASL was previously unknown and unexpected given its core functionality in the cell. However, as
misregulated WASL activity results in disruption of both cytoplasmic F-actin regulation as well as changes in
transcription, it remains unclear how WASL orchestrates specific signals underlying these developmental events.
Here, we capitalize on new paired gain- and loss-of-function models in the zebrafish and the mouse to address
the central hypothesis that WASL regulates skeletal development through modulation of transcription
and is independent of its role in cytoplasmic F-actin dynamics. We outline three independent approaches
to directly address this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will take advantage of the modular nature of WASL protein and
remove specific regions of the protein required for establishing F-actin nucleation. These ∆VCA mutant alleles
of WASL will be compared against the specific gain-of-function WASL allele we have identified, both separately
as well as in cis, through analysis of WASL localization within the cell, cytoplasmic F-actin formation, Hox gene
transcription, as well as skeletal patterning. Then in Aim 2, we will use our models of loss and gain of WASL
activity to define the specific transcriptional and epigenetic changes associated with WASL regulation during
limb and fin development. This allows us to identify definitive transcriptional signatures of WASL in development
and their dependence on Wasl F-actin binding. We will further assess the dependence of F-actin formation in
WASL regulation of chondrogenic differentiation of limb bud cells and how this affects transcriptional modulation
during development. Lastly, in Aim 3, we capitalize on natural variation in WASL amino acid sequence to refine
specific phosphorylated residues as potential key regulators of skeletal diversification. Using our new
experimental tools, we will parse the regulation of WASL activity and function in skeletal growth and patterning
during development. Through the completion of these approaches we will broaden our understanding of the
intricate, and instructive roles of WASL in cell behavior and differentiation and how shifts in this integration can
lead to generation of novel structures and variation in form."

 African-American women have strikingly high rates of coronary heart disease (CHD)-related death and
disability compared to women of all other racial/ethnic groups. This excess burden has persisted for decades,
and is on the rise among young to middle-aged women. Emerging evidence suggests that sleep disturbance
(e.g., short sleep duration, poor sleep continuity) may be an important driver of CHD risk in African-American
women; however, because most research on sleep disturbance in African-American women has focused on
comparisons to women from other racial/ethnic groups, there are substantial gaps in knowledge about factors
that might promote and protect against sleep disturbance within African-American women. Such information
will be critical for the development of targeted intervention efforts to improve sleep and ultimately reduce CHD
risk in this population. The proposed project is designed to examine whether and how “Shifting” -- a novel,
sociocultural phenomenon hypothesized to be salient among African-American women-- might impact sleep
disturbance among this group. Shifting is defined as a seemingly adaptive practice in which African-American
women engage in self-altering behaviors to both fit in with dominant society and accommodate African-
American men. Although documented in qualitative studies and anecdotal accounts of African-American
women’s experiences over the past 30 years, empirical studies of shifting have only recently emerged, and
none have focused on health. We have compelling preliminary data on early middle aged African-American
women, indicating that reports of Shifting (e.g., changing speech patterns, downplaying accomplishments, self-
silencing) are associated with subjective sleep disturbance and body mass index (BMI), not explained by
depressed affect, or discriminatory or other chronic stressors. Building on this preliminary data, we will
examine the prospective interrelationships among shifting, day-to-day psychological processes, and sleep
disturbance in 400 African-American women aged 35-54 from a range of SES backgrounds. Shifting and
subjective sleep quality will be measured with validated questionnaires, and sleep duration and continuity will
be assessed via actigraphy over the course of 14 days at baseline, and in order to shed some light on
temporality, at a 12-month follow up. In order to provide us with a more in-depth understanding of how shifting
might contribute to sleep disturbance on a night-to-night basis, reports of day-to-day stress, negative affect and
vigilance will be assessed via daily diaries concurrent with the actigraphy assessment over the 14-day period.
Finally, we will examine whether our hypothesized relationships are exacerbated by socioeconomic status
(SES), which might increase the likelihood of Shifting, or ameliorated by resilience factors that promote positive
social interactions and self-care (emotional support, religious service attendance, self-compassion). An
exploratory Aim will also examine linkages between Shifting, sleep disturbance, and CHD risk."
10927432,"Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake controls many cell functions, including energy metabolism, signaling and dynamics. Mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation is supported by the robust driving force of the highly negative, inner mitochondrial membrane potential, but is activated only during Ca2+ signals, when cytoplasmic [Ca2+] is elevated. Ca2+ signals are propagated to the mitochondrial matrix through a channel, the calcium uniporter (mtCU), comprised of pore-forming MCU, scaffold EMRE, and Ca2+-sensing regulatory dimers of MICU1 with itself, MICU2 or MICU3. MICU1 deletion results in a permanently open mtCU, whereas MICU2 loss increases and MICU3 loss decreases the Ca2+ sensitivity of the mtCU gating. MICU1 deletion has been shown by us and others to cause perinatal death in mouse and both MICU1 and MICU2 mutations have been linked to human diseases. Evidence has also started to accumulate in support of MICU1 decrease in common disorders like ischemia-reperfusion and cancer. However, despite the MICUs broad disease relevance, their contribution to the organization of calcium signaling and organelle, cell and tissue structure and functions remains undetermined. Here we present preliminary data indicating cell-to-cell and intracellular heterogeneity in the MICUs, which might be relevant for specialization of cells in complex organs. MICU1 loss was shown to be followed by secondary mtCU composition changes, which might be either adaptive or maladaptive, however the temporal ordering of these changes and others beyond the mtCU itself are not known. Whereas MICU1 loss-induced cell injury has been attributed to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, our preliminary findings point to the importance of other contributors, namely mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and structural alterations. Thus, delineating the mechanisms by which MICUs contribute to the inter-and intracellular organization of Ca2+ signaling and the stability of mitochondrial structure and function are of vast significance. Here we pose the hypothesis that MICUs are important for individual cells’ Ca2+ signal fingerprints, for redox homeostasis and for fusion-fission and cristae dynamics of the mitochondria. To test these ideas, we have developed novel assays and assembled an array of cell and mouse genetic models. Our specific aims are to determine (1) if MICU1 gating of the mtCU creates intracellular heterogeneity in Ca2+ signaling; (2) if the control of mtCU gating by MICUs is relevant for mitochondrial redox homeostasis; (3) if MICU1, MICU2 and MICU3 contribute to the control of mitochondrial fusion-fission dynamics and cristae shaping and these contributions depend on the gating of the mtCU. Completion of these aims will provide clues to the mechanisms by which MICUs support mitochondrial membrane dynamics and signaling and to the pathogenesis initiated by perturbing mtCU structure and function."

In the U.S., more than 10% of infants are born with dental anomalies, including tooth agenesis, malformation,
and enamel dysplasia (ED). The study of tooth development is critical for understanding these congenital
disorders and developing novel therapies and treatments, and thus has implications for oral health. However,
the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that control tooth development is not well understood. The long-
term goal is to identify and characterize the transcription factors that function as important regulators of tooth
development in health and disease. The objective of this proposal is to understand the transcriptional and
epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying tooth enamel development and to address why loss-of-function
mutations of the p63 gene cause tooth anomalies, including ED. p63 is a master transcription factor of ectodermal
development and homeostasis, as evidenced by ectodermal dysplasia in individuals with p63 mutations, often
involving ED and other dental anomalies. However, the role of ΔNp63, the major isoform of p63, and the
mechanisms by which ΔNp63 regulates the chromatin and transcriptional regulatory environment in tooth
development is completely unknown due to lack of targeted genetic systems. In response to this need, a well-
defined ΔNp63 knockout mouse model was generated to perform robust, inducible deletion of ΔNp63 in the
developing enamel organ. Based on preliminary data and re-analysis of published work by others, it is
hypothesized that p63 functions as a major regulator of tooth enamel development by comprehensively activating
its target genes, which are essential for driving earlier cell fate specification and later cell differentiation events
in the enamel organ cells. Using genomics and epigenomics approaches and a newly developed mouse model
of ED in ectodermal dysplasia, in which ΔNp63 knockout is induced during tooth development, three important
questions will be addressed. Aim 1 will define the developmental mechanisms that require p63 action during
tooth development. Aim 2 willdefine the molecular mechanisms by which p63 directs tooth development. Finally,
Aim 3 will identify the cell-state transition dynamics and the underlying epigenetic mechanism governed by
ΔNp63 in tooth development. Collectively, these experiments will define the fundamental mechanisms that
govern tooth enamel development on a broad and dynamic scale, which will provide foundational information
essential for developing better ways to diagnose, treat, and prevent congenital and acquired dental disorders."
10888369,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Despite the recent surge in studies reporting on the prevalence and abundance of anaerobic
microbiota in the airways of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), their mechanistic contributions, if any, to
disease pathophysiology remain controversial and poorly understood. This knowledge gap is driven, in
part, by conflicting epidemiological and in vitro experimental data, a lack of suitable model systems to study
their interactions with the host, and the dearth of laboratory expertise in host-associated anaerobic
microbiology. Studies that generate greater insight into the role of anaerobes in CF lung infection,
particularly at early stages, are necessary to determine if, when, and how to target this group of organisms
therapeutically.
 Our team has shown that (i) anaerobes are early colonizers of the pediatric CF airways prior to the
acquisition of canonical pathogens, (ii) anaerobe bacterial communities elicit pro-inflammatory response
when co-cultured with bronchial epithelial cells, and (iii) anaerobe-mediated mucin degradation and cross-
feeding can shape the growth, virulence, and antibiotic susceptibility of canonical CF pathogens. Building
on these data, this project proposes to use a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate how individual
anaerobes interact with one another, the airway epithelium, and traditional pathogens (e.g., P. aeruginosa,
S. aureus) in the context of early CF airway disease. First, using an experimental microbiome model
system composed of 10 CF anaerobic species, we will determine how CF bacterial communities assemble
and how their assembly dynamics are shaped by host and microbial processes. Second, using an
innovative dual oxic-anoxic system that enables co-culture of anaerobic bacteria and airway epithelial cells,
we will use single-cell RNA sequencing to determine how anaerobes interact with the airway epithelium,
and how the host response varies by epithelial cell type. Finally, given that P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and
other aerobic pathogens co-colonize with anaerobic microbiota and rapidly adapt to the airways as patients
age, we will use an in vitro experimental evolution approach to test whether early CF microbiota are
sufficient to drive the adaptation of canonical pathogens to the nutritional milieu of the CF airways.
 At the completion of these aims, we will have defined how individual anaerobes interact with one
another, the host, and traditional CF pathogens. In doing so, these studies will have a meaningful impact
on our mechanistic understanding of the role of airway microbiota in chronic airway disease and may
motivate future studies targeting specific anaerobic bacteria, or even promoting their growth, as a means
of improving clinical outcomes. Finally, we use CF as our model system, but this work is broadly applicable
to other acute and airway infections (e.g., COPD, sinusitis, ventilator associated pneumonias) in which
anaerobes have been implicated but their mechanistic contributions remain undefined."

Antigen receptor genes are assembled from several gene segments via V(D)J rearrangement during
early lymphoid cell development to generate a diverse repertoire of antibodies. During early B cell
development in the bone marrow (BM), V(D)J and VJ joining occurs on the IgH and L chain genes,
respectively and is mediated by the RAG recombinase. VH genes are dispersed through 2.5 Mb of the
Igh locus. Locus compaction serves to facilitate spatial proximity between the rearranged DHJH join
and distal VH genes. Furthermore, V genes rearrange with very different intrinsic frequencies.
However, little is known about the precise looping structure of the Igh locus that leads to locus
contraction. We undertook an analysis of the entire Igh locus using chromosome conformation capture
(3C) based methodology to systematically characterize three-dimensional (3D) chromatin
organization on several genomic scales. We found that the Igh locus is compartmentalized into a
topologically associated domain (TAD) that is partitioned into three sub-domains. A set of pro-B cell-
specific very-long range looping interactions bridge the sub-domains and are Pax5-dependent. These
looping interactions are anchored at Sites I, II, II.5 and III and which are critical facilitators of Igh
locus contraction. We have now defined the DNA motifs in these loop anchors and discovered a series
of pro-B cell specific novel enhancers (NEs) that participate in a NE-NE-VH gene promoter
interactome. We have systematically characterized locus compaction using specific KO mice in
combination with chromatin-loop mapping methods and newly constructed NE1 KO mice and cell
lines. To begin to understand NE interactome function we asked whether those NEs engaged in E-E
and E-Pr looping are in an active state as defined by the H3K27Ac histone marks in single cells. We
discovered that the NEs are marked by remarkably large H3K27Ac foci. Here we will 1)
systematically characterize NEs individually and in the NE interactome as it relates to VH gene usage
during repertoire formation, and 2) examine the relationship between the NE interactome and
H3K27Ac foci. The presence of H3K27Ac foci on NEs may indicate the participation of the Igh locus
in transcriptional condensates which may define the molecular environment for V(D)J recombination."

Excessive alcohol consumption is a leading cause of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). ALD is a major
public health issue in the US due to its rising incidence and prevalence. A better understanding of the
mechanism of ALD pathogenesis is critical and may pave a way to identify potential therapeutic targets. H19 is
a long noncoding RNA; its expression is highly upregulated in the liver of patients with ALD and ethanol-fed
mice. However, the mechanism of H19 in ALD pathogenesis has not been fully explored. Our overarching
objective of this grant application is to understand the mechanism of H19 mediated alcohol-induced liver injury.
For specific aim#1, we plan to determine the molecular mechanism on alcohol induced hepatic H19 expression
by focusing on two major pathways, epigenetic regulation via DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation
by small heterodimer partner (SHP) and Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1). We will also employ our unique
mouse models, H19 maternal specific knockout (H19Mat+/-) and liver specific H19 DNA methylation domain
(DMD) knockout (H19DMDHep-/-) mice, to explore how loss of H19 function effects the hepatic phenotypes. In
specific aim#2, we will determine the molecular mechanism of how H19 mediates alcohol-induced liver injury.
We screened the H19 interacted proteins using RNA immunoprecipitation assay and found polypyrimidine tract
binding protein 1 (PTBP1) binds to N-terminal of H19 RNA. PTBP1 is an RNA-binding protein to act primarily
as repressive regulator of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) alternative splicing. We also found alcohol and H19
reduced PTBP1 expression levels and increased alternative splicing events. Therefore, we will determine the
effect of PTBP1 deficiency on hepatic phenotypes in ethanol-fed mice using our newly generated PTBP1 liver
specific knock out (Ptbp1Hep-/-) mice. Additionally, we identified that H19-PTBP1 axis mediates the splicing of
its novel target gene betaine and homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), which was a critical enzyme in the
methionine metabolism pathway. The splicing process led to a decrease in the BHMT protein coding variant
and the reduction in BHMT protein expression led to a dysregulation of methionine metabolism, which
contributed to alcohol induced liver injury. We will perform several mechanistic studies to determine the role of
H19-PTBP1 axis in mediating BHMT alternate splicing. Taken together, we have developed animal and
cellular models to mechanistically study both up and downstream pathways of H19-mediated ALD
pathogenesis. This proposal is of significance and it may lead to potential therapeutic interventions by
targeting H19-PTBP1-BHMT pathway in patients with ALD."

Asian Americans (AsA) are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the US, projected to double to 43 million
people by 2050; however, our understanding of the factors that lead to disease or health in AsA is limited because
AsA overall and specific AsA subpopulations have been severely under-represented in medical research. To
address key population health research gaps, the NIH has called for a new epidemiologic cohort among AsA
and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders (NHPI). We propose to serve in this nation-wide initiative as a
Clinical/Community Field Center for AsA in the New York Metropolitan Area.
The overarching rationale for a national Asian American Community Cohort (here named the AACC) is to
examine from a “populomics” perspective, the biological, lifestyle, behavioral/environmental and sociocultural
factors that impact the health of AsA, with the ultimate goal of reducing morbidity and mortality. In the NY area,
the AACC-NY will enroll Korean American adults—the most understudied AsA group—and Chinese American
adults—the largest AsA group. A strong feature of AACC-NY is our capacity to target often-marginalized, low-
income, non-English speaking communities in the NY area, who most often experience social and health
disparities and who are often under-represented in epidemiologic research. The New York Metropolitan Area is
home to the largest and most diverse AsA population of any urban region in the US, comprising 3.2 million
residents, of which ~40% are Korean or Chinese American. In the longer term, CVD and other metabolic
diseases such as type II diabetes will be our priority; however, the cohort also supports aims related to broad
health outcomes, particularly through collaborations within the overall national cohort framework.
In this funding period, leveraging our exceptionally strong community outreach, engagement, and community
based participatory research programs with AsA communities, in Aim 1 we will enroll a cohort of 3200 AsA (age
25–64 years, including 1600 Korean and 1600 Chinese) and conduct participant follow up and surveillance
activities, including ascertainment of events of clinical significance. In Aim 2 we will complete baseline exam,
including questionnaire survey, physical exam, subclinical measure of CVD, and biospecimen collection. In Aim
3, we will complete data harmonization and sharing with Other Clinical/Community Field and Coordinating
Centers. Aim 4 will focus on short-term research studies to examine the effect of sociocultural, diet/exercise,
environment, and biological (genetics, microbiome) factors in relation to subclinical markers for cardiometabolic
disease in overall and Korean and Chinese ethnic subgroups.
The AACC is a unique urban platform with integrated community participation to address priority knowledge gaps
regarding cardiovascular health and its disparities in specific AsA subpopulations. This research will provide the
scientific basis for addressing these challenges in AsA communities, including the often marginalized and
underserved."

Millions of individuals around the world are exposed to arsenic, mostly from contaminated drinking water sources,
including many areas in the U.S. Arsenic is a known human carcinogen, and exposure has been consistently
associated with other chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory disease risk with
emerging evidence highlighting its immunomodulatory effects. There is evidence that arsenic exposure
influences epigenetic programming and proposed to be a potential link between arsenic exposure and the latency
of many associated health effects, including cancer. The leading hypothesis that arsenic’s toxicity might involve
epigenetic dysregulation has been tested mostly in adult cross-sectional and birth cohorts with limited follow-up
of participants to test for persistence or clinical relevance of epigenetic changes. The proposed project will
leverage samples and data from a large epidemiological study in Antofagasta, the largest city in Northern Chile,
where extensive arsenic water concentration records exist. In 1958, two rivers with high arsenic concentrations
were diverted into the study region as the primary source of drinking water and this high exposure period ended
in 1970 when an arsenic water treatment plant was installed. As a result, there was a thirteen-year period in
which average arsenic concentrations were 860 µg/L, with much lower levels (<10 µg/L) before and after the
period. This tragic scenario provided a natural experiment to study the latency of health effects among people
exposed to high levels of arsenic with valid comparison populations from the rest of Chile. Studies from this
region have reported strong prospective associations and evidence that early-life arsenic exposure is associated
with increases in lung, bladder, and kidney cancers as well as increased risk of myocardial infarction, chronic
renal disease, bronchiectasis, and respiratory symptoms. These associations were only evident decades after
the peak exposure period and persisted among the exposed population decades after mitigation measures were
taken. We are leveraging already collected samples from individuals exposed in early-life and unexposed
matched study participants to test for persistence of epigenetic disruption decades later in mid-life (median age
~ 50 years). We will evaluate if exposed individuals have accelerated epigenetic aging across multiple epigenetic
clocks that reflect different aspects of biological aging, morbidity, and mortality risk. Additionally, we will test if
exposed individuals have different estimates of leukocyte composition and DNA methylation signatures. We will
match and control for key covariates, such as current urinary arsenic levels, historical arsenic exposure in
adulthood, diet, smoking, BMI, sex, and socioeconomic status. This approach will enable us to test for latency
of epigenetic disruption captured in DNA methylation of leukocytes independent of recent and current arsenic
exposure. If successful, our study will demonstrate that exposure to arsenic during early-life can persistently
program epigenetic biomarkers that are strongly associated with morbidity and mortality decades later."
10846789,"Our understanding of antifungal immunity remains relatively limited, and examples of fungal mechanisms to
modulate these responses are even rarer. C. albicans is a ubiquitous fungal component of mammalian gut
microbiota as well as the most common cause of fungal infections in humans. We identified the lip2-/- virulence
mutant in a screen of ~1500 C. albicans mutants in a mouse model of systemic infection (Basso et al., Cell Host
and Microbe, in press). Whereas a lip2-/- strain exhibits normal virulence attributes during the first 6 hours of
infection, including dissemination through the bloodstream, solid organ invasion, and yeast-to-hypha
morphogenesis, its titers progressively decline at subsequent timepoints, and the host typically survives. Immune
profiling of infected kidneys (the primary target organ in this infection model) revealed significant increases in
levels of IL-17 mRNA and protein in organs infected with lip2-/- compared to wild-type C. albicans (WT).
Strikingly, the virulence of lip2-/- was fully restored when infections were performed in Il17af-/- animals that fail to
produce IL-17. These results suggested that 1) IL-17 is required for a potent antifungal response during systemic
candidiasis and 2) Lip2 somehow opposes this response. We identified renal 𝛄δ T cells as a major source of IL-
17 in lip2-/--infected kidneys and renal dendritic cells as a major source of IL-23 (a cytokine known to stimulate
IL-17 production by 𝛄δ T cells). Further, under in vitro conditions, we observed that lip2-/- (but not WT C. albicans)
activates IL-23 expression by co-cultured bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Using BMDCs prepared
from Tlr2-/-, Tlr4-/-, Tlr2/Tlr4-/-, and Clec7a-/- animals, we further showed that TLR2 and/or TLR4 but not Dectin-1
are required for this response. Remarkably, immune activation was blocked when the coculture experiment is
performed in the presence of 0.1 𝛍M palmitic acid, a hydrolysis product of Lip2. The data support a model in
which WT C. albicans secretes Lip2 in solid organs, thereby raising local concentrations of palmitic acid, which
suppresses TLR2- and TLR4-dependent activation of tissue-resident DCs and, thereby, a downstream IL-17-
dependent antifungal immune response. Beyond unveiling a novel fungal virulence mechanism, this work unveils
a role for IL-17 during systemic fungal infection, in addition to its previously well-documented role in defense
against mucocutaneous candidiasis. To understanding this novel lipid-mediated modulation of the innate
response to C. albicans, we will use a forward genetic approach to identify factors required for modulation of the
innate responses to C. albicans by free fatty acids produced by its lipase activity. These exploratory, high-risk
studies will provide insights lipid-mediated immunosuppression, a novel mechanism of fungal pathogenesis and
immune modulation."

The components of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) include calcitriol deficiency,
hyperphosphatemia, and excesses of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH), all
of which consistently and strongly associate with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with kidney failure
on dialysis. Vascular calcifications are present in >80% of these patients and may be a mechanism through
which CKD-MBD increases CVD risk. Intravenously-administered (IV) vitamin D receptor agonists (VDRA) are
routinely used as first-line therapy for CKD-MBD in kidney failure, supported by experimental and
epidemiological evidence that suggest VDRAs improve CVD and survival. However, the long-term risks and
benefits of the current treatment approach, which encourages escalating VDRA doses to reduce PTH
concentrations towards the normal range, have never been tested by clinical outcomes trials. This approach
often leads to high VDRA doses which incur several risks: (1) a dose-dependent rise in FGF-23, a major risk
factor for CVD that is associated with monotonically increasing risk of death in kidney failure; (2)
hypercalcemia, a key promoter of vascular calcification; (3) low turnover bone disease, which drive calcium
and phosphate into the vasculature because they cannot deposit into bone; (4) held doses of VDRA as a result
of (2) and (3), which interrupts therapy and deprives patients of its likely health benefits.
The goal of this project is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of a low fixed-dose vitamin D strategy
to treat CKD-MBD in kidney failure to move the field towards identifying an optimal strategy that balances the
risks and benefits of VDRA use. The two Aims proposed will leverage a unique partnership with Northwest
Kidney Centers (NKC), the largest provider of dialysis in Seattle, WA. Aim 1 is a 12-month pragmatic
randomized clinical trial of 90 NKC patients on hemodialysis that will compare the effects of a low fixed-dose
oral calcitriol strategy (intervention) with the current usual care of PTH-titrated IV VDRAs (control) on a
comprehensive panel of biomarkers assessing mineral metabolism, bone turnover, and serum calcification
propensity, as well as measures of feasibility and acceptability. Aim 2 is a complementary retrospective cohort
study using the NKC electronic health records database that will test associations between mean VDRA dose
and variability in VDRA doses with CVD event and hospitalization rates. These Aims test whether a low fixed-
dose vitamin D strategy has causal effects that improve intermediate outcomes (Aim 1) and associate with
improved clinical outcomes (Aim 2), building a foundation for future large-scale clinical outcomes trials.
Integrated with this research agenda is a career development plan designed to position me to become a
successful independent investigator in the field of disordered mineral metabolism in CKD. This mentored
approach to training includes regular meetings with co-mentors who are established leaders in multi-
disciplinary fields, structured didactics, attendance at local and national conferences, and experiential training."
10925382,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prescription opioid misuse is a significant burden on adolescent public health in the United States. Opioid
misuse often starts with prescribed opioids, with surgery representing a key pathway by which adolescents are
first prescribed opioids for the management of acute pain. Yet, little is known about the critical period following
surgery during which adolescents initiate prescription opioid misuse or the modifiable behavioral mechanisms
contributing to this process. These are critical gaps in our knowledge impeding our ability to identify
adolescents at increased risk for opioid misuse and to develop interventions aimed at reducing prescription
opioid misuse. Sleep deficiency (including sleep deprivation, noncircadian sleep, sleep disorders, and poor
sleep quality) is an important proximal risk factor for prescription opioid misuse. Sleep is often disturbed during
the perioperative period, a time when many adolescents are exposed to their first opioid prescription. Indeed,
in our own preliminary study, we found that sleep deficiency present both before surgery and during the
immediate postsurgical period was associated with increased opioid use. However, this pilot study did not
allow us to characterize aspects of sleep most strongly related to opioid use and did not allow us to evaluate
mechanisms, such as pain and psychological factors, underlying the sleep – opioid use relationship.
Furthermore, data are urgently needed to determine how sleep deficiency prospectively predicts the
development of opioid misuse behaviors in the context of other putative factors, such as a history of substance
use, pain intensity, psychosocial (e.g., depression), peer, and family factors. Given that sleep deficiency is
modifiable, it is a critical focus of research aimed at reducing the development of adolescent opioid misuse
behaviors. Therefore, this project aims to 1) test the direct and mediation pathways of sleep deficiency, pain,
psychological factors, and opioid use following sports-injury surgery, and 2) develop and validate a
multivariable prediction model to identify adolescents at increased risk of prescription opioid misuse over the
24 months following surgery. To address these aims, we propose a prospective, observational study of N= 400
adolescents (10-19 years) who receive their first ever opioid following sports injury surgery. Presurgery,
participants will undergo comprehensive multimodal sleep assessments (surveys and actigraphy monitoring) to
measure sleep deficiency. Participants will also report on previous substance use, pain intensity, psychosocial,
peer, and family factors. Adolescents will then be followed over the first 14 days after surgery using ecological
momentary assessment to capture real-time daily data on sleep, pain, psychological factors, and opioid use.
We will use an innovative electronic medication monitoring methodology to accurately measure opioid use
(total number of doses and duration) following surgery. Follow-up assessments at 3-months, 6-months, 12-
months, and 24-months will track opioid misuse developing over time. We will apply modern machine learning
algorithms to develop and validate models predicting adolescent prescription opioid misuse."

Low-grade gliomas (LGGs), a heterogeneous group of primary central nervous system tumors, are one of the
most common solid tumors in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population. LGGs can progress to high-
grade gliomas (HGGs) via a process known as malignant transformation (MT), resulting in dismal prognoses.
The mechanisms driving MT of LGG remain poorly understood. In contrast to LGGs, we and others have shown
that HGGs have increased levels of bone marrow-derived myeloid cells (BMDMs) and myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs) in peripheral circulation, with an intra-tumoral enrichment of tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) and a paucity of CD8+T and natural killer (NK) cells. Although myeloid cells are known to
accumulate during glioma progression, it remains unclear if these cells have a causal role in driving MT. Central
hypothesis: Reductions in anti-tumor reactive CD8+T and NK cell-dependent immune surveillance are
responsible for LGG to HGG malignant transformation in AYA patients and these reductions are dictated by
increased infiltration and immune suppressive activity of tumor infiltrating BMDMs. We have identified two
independent myeloid associated pathways that are responsible for these BMDM phenotypes and we propose to
test the central hypothesis through the following two aims: Aim 1. Delineate the dependency of BMDM cell
differentiation on inhibitor of DNA binding protein 2 (ID2). Using AYA RCAS/tv-a glioma mouse models, we will
knockdown ID2 in BMDMs before and during MT. We will examine effects on pro-tumoral myeloid cells and
evaluate intra-tumoral T and NK cells and mobilization in blood, spleen, and bone marrow at various times with
scRNAseq, mass cytometry, and fluorescent-activated cell sorting. We will also leverage digital spatial
transcriptomics (DSP) in ID2 modulated tumors and validate ID2 signaling in human paired LGG /HGG samples
to dissect the expression of myeloid, NK, T cell markers, and checkpoint molecules to illuminate ROIs critical to
MT. Results will illuminate ID2 mechanisms of BMDM cell differentiation to pro-tumoral myeloid cells. Aim 2.
Determine if the CD74/macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) axis regulates BMDM cell differentiation
during LGG malignant transformation. We will investigate CD74’s role in MT using pharmacological treatments
or transplant wild-type or CD74 KD/KO bone marrow cells in a murine RCAS/tv-a glioma model. We will analyze
peripheral blood and the glioma TME using scRNAseq, mass cytometry, and FACS. We will validate findings with
bulk RNA sequencing data on paired LGG/HGGs from AYA patients and investigate how CD74/MIF signaling
drives reduced T and NK cells which supports LGG MT. We will also leverage DSP in CD74/MIF modulated
tumors and validate CD74 signaling in human paired LGG/HGG samples to dissect the expression of myeloid,
NK, T cell markers, and checkpoint molecules to illuminate ROIs critical to MT that will indicate potentially
targetable vulnerabilities. Overall Impact: Our studies will illuminate novel insights that may enable us to translate
into enhanced immune surveillance approaches to delay and/or prevent MT for AYA LGG patients."

Treatment tailored to specific patient characteristics (i.e. precision medicine) has the potential to offer more
effective options for post-operative pain management. Chronic pain conditions are a heavy burden to society
due their economic impact and individual suffering they cause; and developing precision medicine approaches
are a high priority for the Federal Pain Research Strategy. Accordingly, in this proposal, we will initiate a
precision medicine approach for total shoulder arthroplasty by identifying a risk phenotype that is predictive of
chronic post-surgical pain. Biologic, psychologic, and social factors (alone and in combination) will be
considered as candidates for the risk phenotype. Additionally, changes in biochemical biomarkers and
psychologic factors will be considered as post-operative time-varying factors to enhance predictive accuracy
of the risk phenotype. This proposal will support a prospective cohort study of 461 individuals undergoing
primary total shoulder arthroplasty (anatomic or reverse) at Duke Health. The primary outcome is chronic post-
surgical pain 12-months after total shoulder arthroplasty. Risk phenotype measures will be collected pre-
operatively and time-varying factors will be collected pre-operatively and post-operatively. We will investigate
novel combinations of biologic, psychologic, and social factors to determine a chronic post-surgical pain risk
phenotype for total shoulder arthroplasty. Additionally, time-varying factors will be tested for improving
predictive accuracy of the risk phenotype. This proposal will advance the pain research field by addressing
important knowledge gaps in chronic post-surgical pain development for adults with osteoarthritis that are
undergoing a surgical procedure that is a) rapidly increasing in volume and b) has a high risk of post-operative
pain. Successful completion of the study has the potential to alter standard of care for surgical selection and
provide new avenues of precision medicine for post-operative pain management. Specifically, completion of
this study may allow for risk stratification approaches that improve surgical decision making to be implemented
in health care systems and/or identify novel treatment targets that could be tested for effectiveness in
preventing chronic post-surgical pain."
10930903,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer and has a very poor
prognosis due to its tendency to metastasize and relapse. Immune checkpoint blockade (immunotherapy) plus
chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for metastatic TNBC, but the tumor responses are limited and not
durable. Additionally, the lack of robust predictive biomarkers of response remains a limiting factor in
maximizing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a more effective
immunotherapy combination and establish novel biomarkers to identify TNBC patients who will benefit from
this treatment. Because the tumor microenvironment (TME) critically influences TNBC response to
immunotherapy, we set out to identify mechanisms that broadly mediate the immune response in TNBC. Our
preliminary studies showed that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway acts as a TME master switch in
promoting a persistent immunosuppressive TME in TNBC. Building on this evidence, our central hypothesis is
that JNK inhibitors (JNKi) synergize with immunotherapy by converting the TNBC TME from an
immunosuppressive to an immunoactive state. Our hypothesis will be tested through 3 specific aims: Aim 1)
Determine how JNK regulates the immunosuppressive TME and aggressiveness in TNBC; Aim 2) Establish
JNK signaling-related biomarkers of the immunosuppressive status of the TNBC TME; and Aim 3) Develop an
optimal JNKi-immunotherapy combination for TNBC. Completing these aims will provide a robust scientific
framework for developing effective therapeutic strategies for TNBC. The experimental approach will be as
follows: In Aim 1, we will investigate how JNK promotes TNBC aggressiveness by immunologically modulating
the TME using clinically relevant immunocompetent syngeneic TNBC mouse models with well-defined immune
TMEs. We will also identify molecules responsible for JNK’s immunological modulation of the TME. In Aim 2,
we will establish novel JNK signaling-related biomarkers reflecting the immunosuppressive status of the TNBC
TME using patient samples. In Aim 3, we will test whether JNKi synergize with immunotherapy in TNBC by
promoting an immunoactive TME, using clinically relevant immunocompetent syngeneic TNBC mouse models
and our established patient-derived xenografts of TNBC molecular subtypes (sensitive or resistant to
immunotherapy) in humanized mouse models. We expect to 1) generate sufficient preclinical data to support
the development of an effective JNKi-immunotherapy combination for patients with TNBC and 2) establish
biomarkers of the immunosuppressive status of the TNBC TME. The proposed research is significant because
it will fundamentally advance our understanding of mechanisms by which cancers promote suppression of the
response to immunotherapy and may lead to the development of a novel combination immunotherapy that
improves the survival of TNBC patients."

The majority of Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients have a clinical syndrome of dream enactment that
typically develops years before the onset of cognitive impairment. Under normal physiological conditions, rapid
eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by vivid dream mentation combined with skeletal muscle atonia.
This REM paralysis is lost in REM sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD), resulting in patients who trash, punch and
kick at night. RBD is a common condition affecting 80 million people worldwide and >5% of those older than
70. The presence of RBD is highly indicative of underlying neurodegeneration as nearly 75% will develop a
neurodegenerative disorder in 12 years, most commonly DLB or other disorder of alpha-synuclein pathology
such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Among patients with RBD approximately half have developed, or have had
exacerbated, their dream enactment after starting a serotonergic antidepressant (usually a selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor-SSRI). This emergence of dream enactment after starting an SSRI, is termed serotonergic
RBD (5-HT RBD) and was until recently assumed to be caused by a toxic effect on REM sleep circuitry.
However, careful scrutiny of patients with 5-HT RBD reveals neurodegenerative findings suggestive of
impending DLB, such as impaired color vision, mild cognitive impairment and subclinical motor deficits. These
insights suggest that SSRI antidepressants do not induce RBD but instead unmask RBD in an individual who is
already burdened by early alpha-synuclein pathology. However, this has not been proven, and it remains
critical to understand whether 5-HT RBD is, as we suspect, an indicator of prodromal Lewy-body type
pathology. This project will test the hypotheses that people with 5-HT RBD have systemic alpha-synuclein
pathology, brainstem lesions in regions that control REM sleep, and prodromal DLB signs. AIM 1 will seek to
detect abnormally phosphorylated alpha-synuclein aggregates on skin biopsy in a cohort of people with 5-HT
RBD and matched controls (taking SSRIs but without RBD). Aim 2 will use ultra-high field MRI at 7T to
examine the pontine region of the coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex for evidence of neurodegeneration as well
as segment and parcellate REM sleep related neuronal structures. Aim 3 will test for prodromal deficits in
speech consistent with Lewy body disease. While these Aims are independent we suspect that the severity of
speech deficits will correlate with loss of neuromelanin signal on MRI and pathology on skin biopsy. These
studies are important because confirming neurodegeneration in 5-HT RBD would be a breakthrough in
understanding the natural history and progression of DLB pathology. Most importantly, by identifying an early
prodromal syndrome and biomarkers of disease progression, this project will help speed up the development of
therapies to impede or prevent the progression of Lewy body pathology."

African Americans (AA) are less likely to receive quality end-of-life (EoL) care. For example, goals of care
conversations, which are critical discussions between clinicians, patients and families near the end of life, are
less likely to occur for AAs than for Whites, and preferences are less likely to be followed when they do occur.
Instead, families are more likely to be labelled as “difficult” if their decisions are incongruent with clinicians’
recommendations. EoL decisions for many AA persons are rooted in both culture and a lifetime of experiences
of structural racism. Efforts to address disparities need to address multiple factors such as patient-level cultural
identity and EoL care values, interpersonal- and community-level norms for EoL communication and treatment,
and healthcare institutional-contexts for delivering EoL care in a setting affected by institutional racism. Our
research group began to address this need with ‘African American Community Speaks’, a proof-of-concept
prototype of a community-developed training program for clinicians caring for AA older adults with serious illness.
The program originally focused on rural Southern older AAs and is not broadly generalizable across the US due
to geographic differences in culture, attitudes, and communication preferences among AA persons in the US.
Thus, we propose to adapt our prototype program to urban-dwelling Southern and Northern older AA adults
using our established platform of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) in two geographically
diverse regions: Birmingham, Alabama and the Bronx, New York. To create the new training program called
‘Caring for Older African Americans’, our team of experts in CBPR, medical sociology, and clinical trials will
work with local Community Advisory Boards to: 1. Conduct a comparative ethnographic study of urban-
dwelling AAs in the North and South to describe AA community values and preferences related to EoL care; 2.
Adapt of our prior community-developed training program by integrating community-developed storytelling
videos for empathizing with experiences of racism in EoL care, guidelines for culturally concordant EoL care
deliver, and adapting an existing implicit bias management program to goals of care communication; and 3.
Conduct a cluster randomized trial in which we will randomize training times to 1 of 4 start dates using a
stepped wedge design to accommodate training of all clinicians and to mitigate the effect of secular trends.
Patients’ personal experience of racism will be measured using the discrimination subscale of the Group Based
Mistrust Scale. The primary outcome will be patient/family’s perception of therapeutic alliance using The Human
Connection Scale. Secondary outcomes will be family-reported goal-concordant care, and clinicians’ knowledge
of cultural values, awareness of implicit bias, and confidence to change practice. This innovative effort will be
the first training program that: 1. addresses culturally concordant care, systemic racism and implicit bias
management, the three key elements in enhancing the provision of equitable care; and 2. is designed and
implemented in full partnership with two distinct AA communities in the South and the North of the US."

Retinal astrocytes form the integral part of the neural-glial-vascular network in the retina. They
contribute to the establishment of the retinal vasculature, maintenance of the blood-retina barrier
and health of retinal ganglion cells. Although several signaling pathways are known to be active
in astrocytes, how they are integrated to regulate astrocyte development and physiology is still
poorly understood. This project will investigate the role and mechanism of PDGF and FGF
signaling, two closely related receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, in astrocyte development. By
generating mouse mutants and performing living imaging, we will delineate the PDGF signaling
cascade specific to astrocytes and understand how it regulates the migratory behaviors of
astrocytes. Furthermore, we will investigate the molecular mechanism of FGF signaling in
regulating astrocyte maturation. Lastly, we will test the hypothesis that FGF and PDGF signaling
are required for suppression of astrocyte maturation and induction of angiogenesis. Astrocytic
malfunction can lead to impaired retinal vascularization, breakdown of the blood-retinal-barrier
and reactive gliosis, contributing to a cohort of blinding diseases such as retinopathy of
prematurity (ROP), coloboma, and glaucoma. This project is expected to illuminate the
mechanism of PDGF and FGF signaling in astrocytes, which will contribute to understanding and
treatment of ocular diseases."

The stunning clinical success of Gleevec (imatinib) two decades ago appeared to usher in a new era for
cancer treatment, whereby a molecular defect in a patient’s tumor was known and could be exploited with
a selective drug. A suite of such selective drugs were envisioned, 100s of different drugs that could be
prescribed to appropriate patients based on tumor profiling of 100s of different potential defects.
Unfortunately this vision has not come to pass, and, with only a handful of approved drug-target pairs, the
full potential of personalized medicine in oncology has not been realized. While drugs such as imatinib (and
vemurafenib, osimertinib, and a few others) have been game-changers for those cancer subtypes (e.g.,
certain cancer types with Bcr-Abl translocation, BRAFV600E mutation, and EGFRT790M mutation, respectively),
there remain 100s of cancer subtypes and hundreds of exploitable molecular defects that are not matched
with drugs. The plodding progress of traditional drug discovery in this realm suggests new approaches are
needed to fully realize the potential of targeted therapy for oncology. My lab has developed a discovery
platform – from compound synthesis, to cell culture, to target identification, to sophisticated animal models,
to translation – that has resulted in 4 novel cancer drugs licensed and moving to cancer patients in 15 years.
Building off the observation that truly selective drugs that are successful in human cancer patients also show
exquisite selectivity in cell culture, we have identified compounds that have wide activity differential for killing
sensitive cell lines versus non-sensitive cell lines; through this method we have identified compounds with
>100-fold selectivity and that have advanced (or are advancing) to human cancer patients. In work for the
OIA we will create an unprecedented collection of complex-and-diverse compounds, with the novel twist
that these compounds will be biased for anticancer activity through incorporation of an electrophile.
Compounds able to induce selective death in a panel of >100 cancer cell lines and normal cell types will be
advanced through medicinal chemistry optimization. Top compounds will then progress through two parallel
tracks, 1) discovery of the biological target (basis for the anticancer selectivity), with our experience showing
that in most cases this work will reveal novel exploitable defects in cancer, and 2) translational advancement
through the pharmacokinetic/toxicology/efficacy studies and assessment of the ability to engage the immune
system, experiments needed to move the very best compounds to clinical trials in cancer patients. We have
demonstrated the ability to accomplish all parts of this workflow at a high level, enlisting key collaborators
as needed. Through this OIA we will increase our output 2-5-fold, meaning the discovery and development
of 4-10 novel cancer drug/target pairs during the 7 year OIA. As importantly, this work will provide a blueprint
for success that others can mimic, which will ultimately enable full realization of the potential of personalized
medicine, with hundreds of drugs for the hundreds of different cancer subtypes."

In partnership with Deaf-owned agency National Deaf Therapy (NDT), we propose the first-ever full-scale
psychotherapy trial conducted in the Deaf community. The U.S. Deaf community – more than 500,000
Americans who communicate using American Sign Language (ASL) – experiences nearly triple the rate of
lifetime problem drinking compared to the general population and twice the rate of trauma exposure. Hearing
individuals have access to several validated treatments for comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) and trauma;
yet there are no evidence-based treatments to treat any behavioral health condition with Deaf clients.
Available behavioral health treatments fail to meet Deaf clients’ unique language access needs. Deaf people’s
median English literacy level falls at the fourth grade and health-related vocabulary parallels non-English-
speaking U.S. immigrants. Leveraging extensive community engagement to address these barriers, the PI’s
team of Deaf and hearing researchers, clinicians, filmmakers, actors, artists, and Deaf people with AUD/PTSD
developed and pilot tested Signs of Safety, a Deaf-accessible toolkit to be used with the Seeking Safety
treatment protocol. The Signs of Safety toolkit provides a supplemental therapist guide and population-specific
client materials (e.g., visual handouts, filmed ASL teaching stories) to meet Deaf clients’ language needs.
Preliminary data from the Signs of Safety single-arm pilot and randomized feasibility pilot showed reductions in
alcohol use frequency and PTSD severity from baseline to follow-up. The delivery of the experimental
intervention was deemed feasible by study therapists and was well-received by participants, especially when
moved to a virtual platform in response to the COVID-19 pandemic – an acceleration of the inevitable
development needed to scale Signs of Safety to a national level for the proposed clinical trial.
Leveraging the existing infrastructure and robust referral network of NDT, we will enroll 144 Deaf adults with
past-month PTSD and problem drinking into a national, full-scale, virtual clinical trial comparing (1) Signs of
Safety with (2) treatment as usual and (3) a no treatment control. Primary clinical outcomes at immediate post-
treatment and post-treatment follow-up are past 30-day alcohol use frequency/quantity (Alcohol Timeline
Followback) and past 30-day PTSD severity (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5). Assessment will occur at baseline,
mid-treatment, immediate post-treatment, three-month post-treatment follow-up, and six-month post-treatment
follow-up. Additionally, we will analyze potential moderators and mediators that lead to positive outcome,
including coping self-efficacy, self-compassion, motivation for treatment, and access to health information.
Our proposed aims build on eight years of KL2 and R34 empirical work, moving this program of research from
Stage IB (two-arm feasibility and pilot testing) to Stage II/III (real world efficacy). The proposed R01 will
potentially validate the first-ever evidence-based therapy for Deaf people, as well as provide future behavioral
health researchers with a vital roadmap for conducting community-engaged clinical trials with Deaf people."

Fluid shear stress-dependent vessel remodeling is an essential regulatory mechanism in embryonic
development and in adult vascular homeostasis where it optimizes blood flow to target tissues. Conversely, un-
or mis-regulated remodeling results in vascular malformations, while poor remodeling is a key aspect of blood
flow restriction in coronary and periphery artery disease. Our preliminary data reveal the existence of a regulatory
network with two mutually inhibitory states, one associated with vessel stability and one with physiological
outward remodeling or pathological AVM formation. These results allow us to propose a unifying hypothesis that
links physiological and pathological remodeling, and suggest the existence of control points that can be
manipulated to either increase or decrease vascular lumen diameter. The project aims to elucidate these
regulatory mechanisms and then harness these new insights to investigate their relevance to vascular
development, to identify therapeutic targets for HHT patients who suffer from excessive pathological remodeling,
and identify therapeutic targets for coronary and peripheral artery disease patients where physiological
remodeling is impaired. We will define the molecular basis of this novel EC shear stress mechanism, determine
its biological role and develop and test therapeutic applications based on this knowledge."

 Tear secretion (lacrimation) is an essential mechanism that lubricates our eyes and helps reduce eye
irritants and microbial infections. Lacrimal deficiency is associated with many systemic or ocular diseases
including primary Sjögren's syndrome, lupus, dry eyes, congenital alacrima, and viral infections. Previous studies
have suggested that the superior salivatory nucleus (SSN) controls lacrimation. However, direct molecular and
genetic evidence is lacking. We recently identified a highly restricted neuronal population in mouse SSN. Ablation
of this neuronal population remarkably reduces lacrimation in mice, suggesting that this neuronal population
controls lacrimation. To test this hypothesis, we will first determine the efferent targets and physiological
properties of these SSN neurons (Aim 1). Results from these experiments will provide valuable information
regarding the encoding and transmission of lacrimal signals. Second, we will investigate the role of these SSN
neurons in controlling lacrimation by specific ablation or activation of this neuronal population (Aim 2). Results
from these experiments will provide functional evidence for SSN control of lacrimation. Finally, we will test these
SSN neurons receive sensory inputs from ocular surface and mediate reflex lacrimation (Aim 3). Results from
these experiments will help define previously unrecognized connections between ocular sensory inputs and SSN,
offering novel insights into the neural mechanism underlying the reflex lacrimation. In summary, our proposed
research will help reveal the neural circuit for lacrimation and provide foundational knowledge for future studies
of lacrimation deficiency associated with ocular or systemic diseases."

The goal of this work is to refine neuroimaging methods to enable quantitation of choroid plexus (ChP) anatomy
and function non-invasively in vivo, and subsequently to use these methods to test fundamental hypotheses
regarding ChP activity, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, and anatomical and protein markers of molecular
clearance dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRDs). The premise for this
work is based on the known role of the ChP complexes for CSF production, and the recent link between
bulk and perivascular CSF flow dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders, yet a lack of robust
methods for quantifying these pathways in humans. We have shown that arterial spin labeling (ASL)
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods and deep learning algorithms can be re-parameterized to enable
reproducible estimates of ChP perfusion (ml/100g/min) at high spatial resolution and accurate automated
localization, respectively: in preliminary data from 139 volunteers, we have (i) demonstrated abilities to
obtain reproducible ChP perfusion estimates in healthy adults (n=10); (ii) observed that improvements
in vascular health reduce ChP activity (n=23) and progressive intracranial vasculopathy increases ChP
perfusion (n=75); and (iii) report here that in older adults with ADRDs, ChP is elevated relative to age-
matched adults without dementia (n=31). These data highlight the possibility of evaluating ChP function in
vivo in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease. However, extant methods require refinement to improve
ChP localization and quantitative accuracy, including an expanded knowledge of ChP physiology and how ChP
activity relates to anatomical markers of molecular clearance and symptomatology. Here, we propose to address
these gaps in our understanding. In Aim (1), we will perform systematic measurements of ChP MRI relaxation
times and circulatory dynamics; findings will improve ChP perfusion accuracy beyond current approaches that
utilize convenience calibration values from other tissues. In Aim (2), we will extend prior studies demonstrating
circadian variation in CSF production to quantify diurnal variation in ChP perfusion during sleep and wakefulness;
results will serve as a necessary prerequisite for future studies that utilize ChP function as a surrogate or
complement to glymphatic or CSF flow dysfunction. In Aim (3), we will quantify ChP perfusion in participants
with ADRD in sequence with bulk CSF flow velocity through the cerebral aqueduct, parasagittal dural volume,
and proteinopathy. Data will be used to test fundamental hypotheses regarding the relevance of ChP activity and
impaired trans-molecular passage in the setting of normal and heightened amyloid burden and clinical dementia.
Findings will provide the first data on how ChP activity, quantified non-invasively in vivo from high
spatial resolution perfusion MRI, reflects variation in traditional or novel fluid efflux. Successful
completion will provide new acquisition and post-processing resources, which will provide a foundation
for using these methods in the growing number of applications of CSF clearance dysfunction."

The US population is rapidly aging and becoming more diverse. Yet substantial disparities in health outcomes
remain for older adult populations from diverse communities. In order to achieve health equity for older adults,
NIA’s Strategic Directions for Research, 2020-2025 Goal F is to ‘understand health disparities related to aging
and develop strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations.’ Accordingly, the
Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) at the University of California San Francisco’s research
theme is to understand multilevel social and behavioral mechanisms of health disparities impacting older adults
and develop interventions to achieve health equity. Growth and diversification of the research workforce to
investigate the mechanisms of health disparities and identify solutions for older adults is crucial. NIA’s Goal G
is to ‘support the infrastructure and resources needed to promote high-quality research’, a goal shared by
CADC. A Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) since 1997, CADC has a successful track
record of providing pilot study funding, comprehensive training in behavioral and social research on aging and
older adults (aging-related health disparities research), and longitudinal mentorship of early-stage diverse
researchers until they obtain independence. CADC’s Faculty have a multiplicity of social and behavioral
focused aging-related health disparities research expertise and a wealth of experience mentoring diverse
early-stage investigators in establishing sustained research careers. CADC has closely mentored 99 diverse
Scientists (20 in the 2018-2023 cycle) from traditionally excluded and underrepresented in research groups.
CADC’s goal for this proposed renewal is to build on our position of strength to advance NIA's Strategic Plan.
With a focus on our research theme, CADC will accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1) select 3-4 CADC
Scientists per year, provide pilot study funding, train them in social and behavioral research methods tailored to
their pilot and subsequent research and mentor them to develop independent, sustained careers in aging-
related health disparities research; 2) develop methodological resources as needed by our Scientists to
promote and build capacity in utilizing optimal methods in aging-related health disparities research and
disseminate these resources through publications and our website; 3) expand joint research and mentoring
collaborative activities between CADC and our newly affiliated Hispanic serving institution, University of
California Merced (UCM), and between CADC and other UCSF NIA/NIH sponsored centers, programs, and
aging-related researchers; 4) maintain CADC’s structure, processes, and culture of diversity, equity, inclusion,
and accessibility (DEIA) to effectively mentor CADC Scientists and coordinate all CADC Core activities and
external activities with other RCMARs and the RCMAR Coordinating Center. Through impactful research,
CADC Faculty and Scientists will contribute to improving the health status for older adults in diverse

 Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common cause of dementia, often triggers progressive
cognitive impairment similar to that of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The current treatment strategies focusing on
local lesions for AD and dementia have not led to satisfactory outcomes. Therefore, comprehensively
understanding of the pathogenesis of VaD and AD is urgently required to address the unmet scientific and clinical
needs. Vascular pathologies across all vasculature have also been linked to VaD and AD. Most notably,
atherosclerosis, stroke and hypertension accelerate the progression of cognitive impairments and dementia of
all causes. Multiple large genome-wide studies identify the atherosclerosis risk gene apolipoprotein E (APOE)
as a strong genetic risk factor for AD. However, despite shared genetic risk factors, atherosclerosis and AD are
often separated in clinical management and mechanistic studies. Pan-vascular diseases represented by
coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, aneurysm and peripheral artery disease are all associated with VaD,
thus, investigating pan-vascular changes that impact cognitive functions may open up new avenues to
understand VaD and AD. The current application represents our long-term goals to uncover novel mechanisms
linking vascular dysfunctions in the cardio and cerebrovascular systems to VaD and AD. Our effort has led to
the discovery of a new role of the Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) in regulating both aortic and cerebral
vascular pathologies and cognitive functions. We and others previously reported that Runx2 is an integral
regulator for vascular calcification. Our preliminary studies identified novel function of Runx2 in regulating
atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in mice; and uncovered upregulation
of Runx2 in aging, atherosclerosis and AD mice as well as in human AD/VaD tissues. Single cell RNA
sequencing analysis further discovered a novel regulation of Runx2 on SMC phenotypic switch, beyond its known
activity in promoting SMC calcification. With an array of molecular, biochemical, proteomics and bioinformatics
approaches, preliminary studies uncovered Runx2 interaction with an essential contractile SMC regulator, serum
response factor (SRF), supporting a novel Runx2/SRF regulatory network in SMC phenotypic switch and
calcification. Elucidating the novel function of Runx2 and Runx2-dependent signaling in regulating VaD will
provide new insights to fill the knowledge gaps, which may lead to novel strategies for clinical management or
treatment of VaD and AD."
10930101,"Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases of childhood, and a leading cause of pediatric emergency
department (ED) visits in the US. Guideline-based asthma management, including treatment with daily
preventive medications, can reduce severe asthma flare-ups requiring acute healthcare services. Unfortunately,
many children in the ED with asthma are not adequately treated with preventive medications. Children from low
income and historically marginalized populations are disproportionately likely to be diagnosed with asthma and
require emergency asthma care, yet least likely to be prescribed preventive medication. Poor rates of primary
care follow-up after ED discharge result in missed opportunities to optimize treatment and home management
and reduce preventable morbidity. Our prior work has demonstrated that a school-based telemedicine
intervention for children 3-12 years can facilitate follow-up assessments by primary care providers after ED
discharge, and lead to increased prescriptions for preventive medications. Despite access to appropriate
treatment, however, the intervention did not lead to improved adherence or reduce symptoms and repeat ED
visits. Reducing morbidity for children with asthma in the ED will require a comprehensive guideline-based
approach that combines primary care follow-up and treatment with preventive medications, with patient-centered
education to support home management and adherence. To enhance home management, we also successfully
piloted an intervention of hospital-to-home educational support for children (5-13 years) admitted with asthma
that features pictorial materials, health literacy techniques, and a pair of in-home telehealth visits for educational
reinforcement after discharge. In response to NOT-OD-21-100: Improving Patient Adherence to Treatment and
Prevention Regimens to Promote Health (PA-20-183), we now propose a 2-group randomized trial to test the
TEACH-ER (Telehealth-Enhanced Asthma Care for Home after the Emergency Room) intervention vs an
enhanced care (EC) control group. The TEACH-ER intervention combines and expands upon our prior work,
and includes: 1) brief initial teaching in the ED; 2) in-home telehealth follow-up visit with primary care providers,
with a prompted recommendation for guideline-based preventive treatment and home delivery of prescriptions
with a pictorial action plan; 3) two additional in-home telehealth visits to deliver health literacy-informed asthma
education and home management support. We will enroll 430 children (ages 3-12 yrs) from the two dedicated
pediatric EDs in our region. We will assess the effectiveness of the program in reducing morbidity (e.g. repeat
ED visits or hospitalizations for asthma, symptom severity, quality of life), improving adherence, and improving
preventive asthma care. Participants will complete telephone follow-up assessments 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after
enrollment; we will also collective objective data on acute care use from the electronic medical record and
prescription fill data. At the study’s completion, the effectiveness of this novel system of care will be better
defined as a sustainable means to improve preventive care and reduce morbidity for children with asthma."

Viruses have imposed a significant global burden of morbidity and mortality for millennia. Just in the last
century, highly pathogenic RNA viruses such as influenza A, HIV and SARS-CoV-2 resulted in devastating
pandemics that directly impacted millions of individuals and altered socioeconomic dynamics worldwide.
Fueled by major advances in sequencing during the last decades, the emerging field of archeovirology has
begun identifying viruses that severely impacted humans prior to the 20th century. To this day, however, the
pathogens responsible for important past epidemics are still unknown and there are significant gaps remaining
in the evolutionary history of certain viral families, especially for RNA viruses. Using a highly collaborative and
innovative approach to overcome intrinsic limitations in the identification of viral genomes from human remains,
this proposal will uncover the viral diversity that existed during periods of notable epidemic outbreaks and
expand our knowledge of the origins and evolution of highly pathogenic viruses. In particular, this proposal
seeks to identify and characterize genomes from centuries-old RNA viruses, a goal that so far has remained
elusive. Using well-established ancient DNA techniques, forensic proteomics, and improved RNA isolation
methodologies, our team will reconstruct viral genomes from human remains of deadly epidemics in early
colonial Mexico and preserved lung specimens from pathology collections corresponding to the industrial
revolution in Great Britain. Guided by archeological and historical documentation in these two distinct historical
contexts, this work will identify viruses that existed in the past ~500 years, study their origin and evolutionary
relationships to modern viruses, and characterize the evolution of viral protein function in relation to their
human hosts. Together, this proposal will generate a comprehensive characterization of the properties of past
viral infections that will not only lead to the identification of viruses responsible for epidemics that profoundly
altered human history but will also uncover evolutionary adaptations between past and present viruses and
define the origins of highly pathogenic RNA viruses, providing key molecular information to prepare against the
(re)emergence of highly virulent viruses in the future."

Current ulcerative colitis (UC) treatments only alleviate symptoms and maintain remission of UC. Thus, studies
to identify new regulatory factors are required. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) account for a significant
proportion of the human genome and have been implicated in the development of chronic and inflammatory
diseases. To date, a small number of studies have indicated that lncRNAs play a role in regulating intestinal
epithelial barrier integrity, and lncRNA expression has been shown to correlate with disease progression in UC.
Yet, the physiological functions of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of UC remain unknown. Recent studies indicate
that lncRNAs can localize to specific organelles and regulate cellular metabolic pathways. However, there is a
significant gap in our knowledge of the physiological function of these subcellular lncRNAs in the tissue
microenvironment.
During my postdoctoral studies in the laboratory of Dr. Kate Fitzgerald at UMass Chan Medical School, I identified
a novel transcript of the lncRNA HOXA11os that translocates to the mitochondria in colonic cells. Through direct
interactions with proteins associated with the Krebs cycle and complex I of the electron transfer chain,
HOXA11os regulates oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in the distal colon to restrict intestinal
inflammation. This study pioneered our understanding of lncRNA function in colonic tissue and provided the first
evidence of a lncRNA that localizes to the mitochondria to regulate its activity. The question remains whether
additional lncRNAs localize to other organelles and regulate metabolic pathways. Thus, the overall goal of this
proposal is to identify and characterize organelle-residing lncRNAs that regulate tissue homeostasis
and inflammation through direct regulation of organelle function and metabolic pathways.
This proposal is focused on three Research Areas. The first Research Area will focus on identifying endogenous
lncRNAs that localize to organelles and the molecular mechanisms regulating their subcellular trafficking and
organelle import. The second Research Area will focus on characterizing the precise molecular mechanisms by
which organelle-residing lncRNAs regulate protein activity in metabolic pathways associated with UC. The third
Research Area will focus on identifying the physiological role of organelle-residing lncRNAs in the onset and
progression of UC to target them for treating UC. Together, these studies will identify novel lncRNAs that regulate
the function of metabolic organelles to maintain homeostasis and restrict intestinal inflammation.
The goals of this proposal are highly relevant to the mission of the NIAID and will enhance our understanding of
distinct lncRNA biology in the colon microenvironment. Ultimately, this work will aid in the design and
development of therapeutics for the treatment of UC and will potentiate future studies to assess the role of
organelle-residing lncRNAs in other inflammatory diseases."
10914257,"Flask shaped invaginations known as caveolae function as important regulators of cellular and physiological
processes and have been linked to a number of diseases ranging from cardiovascular disorders to cancer.
The caveolins, a family of monotopic membrane proteins, serve as fundamental building blocks of caveolae.
Remarkably, caveolins have eluded high resolution characterization since their discovery in the early 1990s.
This has made it nearly impossible to understand the exact mechanisms by which caveolae form and function
or how defects in caveolae give rise to disease. To fill this critical gap in knowledge, we have assembled an
investigative team consisting of experts in single particle electron microscopy, the structure of membrane
proteins, computational analysis of protein structure, and the cell biology and biochemistry of caveolins. Our
combined efforts have now led to the first atomic structure of human caveolin-1 (Cav1) assembled in an
oligomeric form required for caveolae assembly, the 8S complex. This represents an enormous step forward
for the field, which up until now has operated in the absence of definitive structural insights into how Cav1
oligomerize to form complexes or what regions of Cav1 are required to bind other proteins and lipids to build
functional caveolae. Here, we propose to leverage our success in determining the structure of the Cav1 8S
complexes to address a new series of questions about the structural and functional properties of this enigmatic
protein family using a combination of structural, computational, biochemical, and cell biological approaches.
First, we will interrogate the role of key residues and domains in controlling the formation and structure of
human caveolin 8S complexes and its sensitivity to naturally occurring pathogenic mutations. Second, we will
test the hypothesis that the ability of caveolins to assemble into membrane-associated oligomeric complexes
capable of remodeling membranes is one of their most ancient functions by studying representative caveolins
across the evolution. Third, we will probe the ability of structurally diverse caveolins, generated either as a
consequence of genetic variability or evolutionary divergence, to support the biogenesis of functional caveolae.
Successful completion of these studies will provide a much-needed framework to understand how Cav1
assembles into caveolae capable of ensuring proper function of multiple cell types and organ systems, how
disease-associated mutations of Cav1 interfere with these processes in humans, and how evolution has
harnessed this protein to accomplish its many roles in organisms across Metazoa and beyond."
10898807,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a multifunctional signaling lipid and central biosynthetic intermediate that is subject
to strong homeostatic regulation, with its levels tightly controlled in space and time. Though many PA-
metabolizing enzymes and PA transporters are characterized, it is not well understood how cells sense changes
in PA levels and how homeostasis is achieved. To both elucidate mechanisms underlying the spatiotemporal
regulation of PA metabolism and reveal a broader spectrum of effector proteins that propagate PA signaling, we
posit that new strategies to rapidly perturb PA levels with organelle-level precision are required. We have begun
to develop precision “membrane editing” tools for the rapid installation of physiologically active pools of PA on
target organelles. An optogenetic phospholipase D (optoPLD) uses blue light to recruit a bacterial PLD to desired
organelle membranes, where it generates transient pools of PA via phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, and recent
directed evolution efforts have yielded second-generation, super-active optoPLDs (superPLDs). The
combination of superPLD-mediated membrane editing and organelle membrane proteomics via proximity
biotinylation using a membrane-tethered TurboID, which we term a “feeding and fishing” (F+F) strategy, has
afforded us a global view of rapid changes to the integral and peripheral membrane proteomes of the plasma
membrane during conditions when its lipidome is edited using superPLD to transiently elevate PA levels. Beyond
detecting known regulators of PA metabolism, we identified and validated new candidate proteins for sensing,
transporting, and signaling the presence of PA in these membranes. Yet, several critical issues remain
unaddressed, related to both method development and mechanistic understanding of hits from our screens. The
overall objective of this proposal is to deploy new optogenetic and proteomics tools to understand how cells
establish and maintain functionally distinct PA pools in different locations to balance biosynthetic and signaling
needs. First, we will develop ultralow-background, next-generation optogenetic PLDs and apply them to elucidate
roles for PA in mediating crosstalk between two major cell signaling pathways and discover new regulators of
PA homeostasis. Second, we will elucidate roles for a new player implicated in the interorganelle transport of PA
using a combination of cellular and in vitro studies. Third, we will elucidate the molecular details and functional
importance of the interaction of PA with a newly discovered PA-binding protein whose mutation causes a
heritable musculoskeletal disease. Collectively, our studies will yield widely useful tools for membrane editing
and deciphering PA signaling and establish a mechanistic framework for understanding how cells exert
spatiotemporal control over the levels and bioactivity of a pleiotropic lipid to maintain homeostasis and direct
specific physiological and signaling events."

Compared to Caucasians, African American (AA) kidney transplant recipients have twice the risk of graft loss.
Despite recent studies demonstrating marginal improvements in access to transplant, a kidney transplanted
today functions about half as long in AA recipients as compared to Caucasians. Our formative research
demonstrates that in contemporary kidney recipients, several late (≥2 years) post-transplant clinical markers,
including acute rejection, high tacrolimus trough variability and sub-optimal control of hypertension and diabetes
can explain disparities in AAs. We completed a 60 patient prospective interventional pilot study demonstrating
significant improvements in the control of hypertension and diabetes through a technology-enabled intervention.
This study demonstrated that clinical improvements in hypertension control were more substantial in AAs. We
also completed two randomized controlled trials demonstrating that real-time medication adherence monitoring
is feasible and highly accepted within kidney recipients. This demonstrates a technology-based automated
medication monitoring system is a promising intervention to identify and prevent late medication non-adherence,
thus reducing high tacrolimus variability and the risk of late rejection. Based on this formative research, we
propose to conduct the Multifaceted Intervention to Improve Graft outcome disparities in African American
Kidney Transplants (MITIGAAT) study. The overarching hypothesis for MITIGAAT is that the increased burden
of late clinical events and comorbidity burden within AA kidney transplant recipients are the primary contributor
to disparities in graft survival and a multimodal intervention that achieves improved identification and
management of these issues will address this disparity. We will test this hypothesis through a rigorously
conducted large-scale, long-term, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial in kidney transplant recipients
aiming to demonstrate improved tacrolimus trough variability and control of hypertension and diabetes in those
randomized to the intervention arm, as compared to the control arm while reducing disparities in AAs. Our
secondary aim is to conduct a cost benefit analysis to demonstrate that the intervention reduces healthcare
utilization and associated costs; our exploratory aim is to measure the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss
in AA kidney recipients, comparing this between the intervention and a control cohort. The enduring goal of this
proposal is to demonstrate an effective, efficient, and feasibly deployable method to improve long-term outcomes
in AA kidney recipients while reducing health disparities."

This application investigates the relationship between mitochondrial RNA, inflammation, senescence, and aging.
Cellular senescence is a well-established driver of tissue and organismal aging, a process thought to be partly
mediated via the induction of a chronic Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Consequently,
there is great interest in selectively targeting senescent cells as a strategy to promote healthy aging. Our work
has demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of cellular senescence and a driver of the SASP
and that by targeting them we may be able to suppress the detrimental SASP known to contribute to aging.
Mitochondrial double-stranded RNA (mtdsRNA) when present in the cytosol is known to be especially
immunogenic and trigger an inflammatory response. We observed that senescent cells contain increased levels
of cytosolic mtdsRNA together with increased expression of RNA sensors. Furthermore, we found that
transfection of cells with mtdsRNA triggers an inflammatory response and inhibition of mitochondrial DNA
transcription in senescent cells, decreases the SASP. Finally, we observed that mtdsRNA requires the cytosolic
DNA sensor cGAS to induce inflammation suggesting an interplay between RNA and DNA sensing pathways in
the process. This led us to hypothesize that cytosolic mdsRNA plays a role in the regulation of the SASP and
may be a novel target for interventions to improve healthspan during aging.
In this project, we will dissect the mechanisms by which mtdsRNA increases in the cytosol of senescent cells as
well as investigate if activation of RNA sensing pathways contributes to the SASP. Additionally, we will explore
the mechanisms mediating the interplay between mitochondrial DNA and RNA in the development of the SASP.
Our ultimate goal is to identify new interventions that target senescent cells to alleviate age-related dysfunction."

Child maltreatment (CM) is a broad-ranging risk factor associated with compromised development and
maladaptation. Yet, there is vast heterogeneity in the experience of CM and its developmental outcomes. Several
of the field’s most pressing developmental questions involve exploring such heterogeneity. However,
investigating risk heterogeneity in CM populations requires sensitive longitudinal studies of high-risk, hard-to-
reach subjects with adequate power to detect unique subgroups who differ in the experience and consequences
of CM—such studies are costly, arduous, and rare. This project aims to address this gap.
The overall objective of this project is to apply Integrative Data Analysis (IDA)—a principled set of methodologies
and statistical techniques used to conduct simultaneous analysis of raw data pooled from multiple datasets—as
a method to address questions about risk heterogeneity that may not be addressed through individual CM studies
alone. This project will use IDA to pool data from 7 NIH-funded CM cohorts that used gold-standard methods to
examine the development of long-term CM sequelae across biopsychosocial domains. Pooling original data from
multiple CM studies stretches the developmental period under observation, generates a more heterogenous
sample, and increases statistical power to examine important sources of risk heterogeneity. IDA will yield an
integrated sample (N = 2,898) that includes assessment of an array of biopsychosocial processes from ages 4
through 40. The IDA dataset will be used to address three aims: A1) determine how heterogeneity in CM
exposure (i.e., variation in types, developmental timing, and chronicity of exposure) differentially influences
developmental sequelae; A2) identify heterogeneity in the developmental outcome trajectories of CM survivors
and examine which features of CM exposure are associated with specific trajectories; A3) explore how CM
exposure and subsequent developmental processes differ based on racial/ethnic heterogeneity.
This project is innovative because it will leverage $25 million of NIH investment in CM research to unlock the
constraints of isolated studies, creating a pooled source of CM data that is more powerful and diverse than any
individual cohort, maximizing the value of complementary efforts in the field. This contribution will be significant
because it will help to parse risk heterogeneity in CM survivors, which is necessary to improve the precision of
our interventions. Further, this project will create an integrative CM dataset that will be a shared data resource
for the field, resulting in exponential contributions that extend beyond this K01. Finally, this proposal will greatly
enhance the PI’s career development and enable him to advance toward his long-term goal of becoming an
independent investigator who can advance the fields of child development and CM via innovative methods.
Training-mentorship will be provided to learn IDA methodologies; gain expertise to study risk heterogeneity;
acquire skills in longitudinal data analysis; and gain team science skills."
10924007,"SUMMARY
 Stem cell exhaustion is one of the key hallmarks of aging. In tissues throughout the body, there is a
decline in stem cell number and function with age, leading to a loss of tissue homeostasis and
regenerative capacity. Restoring youthful functionality to aged stem cells has been shown to improve
the structure and function of aged tissues. As such, understanding the drivers of stem cell aging has
the potential to reveal targets for rejuvenating tissue and even organismal aging.
 Despite the wealth of information on the phenotypic changes of stem cells with age, little is known
about the underlying molecular mechanisms that drive those changes. Among those potential
molecular mechanisms, we have explored genomic instability (another hallmark of aging) as a feature
of aged stem cells. In the proposal, we propose that genomic instability and the accumulation of DNA
damage underlie the age-related decline in stem cell number. Using muscle stem cells (MuSCs) as a
model system, we have reported evidence of increases in DNA damage in aged MuSCs. This
accumulation of DNA damage leads to an increased propensity of MuSCs to undergo a form of cell
death called mitotic catastrophe when they attempt to enter the cell cycle when they are called upon to
repair muscle. We found that this increased risk of cell death is associated with an age-related
decrease in p53 activity, and that stabilizing or enhancing p53 reduces mitotic catastrophe and
promotes muscle repair in aged mice. At the same time, we have found that that ATR, a key mediator
of the DNA damage response (DDR), is highly active in quiescent MuSCs. The primary goal of the
studies of this proposal are to explore the mechanistic relationship between two hallmarks of aging -
genomic instability and stem cell exhaustion.
 Toward this goal, we will pursue three independent Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will explore the role
of p53 in the regulation of MuSC number during aging. We will use gain-of-function and loss-of-function
genetic models to test this hypothesis. In Aim 2, we will examine the role of ATR in MuSC maintenance
with age. These studies will include an unbiased phosphoproteomic screen to determine downstream
mediators of ATR in MuSC maintenance. Aim 3 will focus on a p53 target gene, NDRG1, which has
been shown to regulate genomic integrity in cancer cells under conditions of low proliferative states. In
Preliminary Studies, we have found that NDRG1 slows MuSC activation, which is essential for the
repair of DNA damage prior to cell division. We will examine the role of NDRG1 in MuSC activation
during aging, again using gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches. Together, these studies will
advance our understanding of stem cell aging and highlight approaches to restore youthful function to
aged stem cells as a way to enhance tissue homeostasis and repair in older individuals."

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), a clonal hematological malignancy of early childhood, has limited
therapeutic options. While the current standard of care for patients with JMML relies on allogeneic stem cell
transplant, relapse remains the main cause of treatment failure, most likely due to the persistence of leukemic
stem cells (LSCs), a small population of self-renewing precursor cells that gives rise to the bulk of tumor cells.
This reservoir of tumor cells is responsible for the long-term maintenance of leukemia growth and is also a major
source of drug resistance. It remains a critical challenge to develop effective therapeutics to eradicate these
tumor initiating cells. A novel treatment approach focused on the unique characteristics and vulnerabilities of
LSCs is needed in order to address this problem. JMML is associated with genetic mutations in the signaling
proteins involved in the Ras pathway, among which the protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn11 (Shp2), a positive
regulator of Ras signaling, is most frequently mutated (heterozygous). These mutations cause greatly increased
catalytic activity of Shp2, and JMML patients with Ptpn11 mutations have the worst prognosis in all subtypes of
JMML. We created a line of conditional knock-in mice with the Ptpn11E76K mutation, the most common mutation
found in JMML. Induction of the Ptpn11E76K/+ mutation in the hematopoietic system (Ptpn11E76K/+/Mx1-Cre+ mice)
resulted in JMML-like myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with full penetrance, suggesting a causative role of this
mutation in the pathogenesis of JMML. With this unique mouse model, we have recently discovered that while
the Ras/Erk signaling pathway was aberrantly enhanced, Stat3 activity as reflected by tyrosine phosphorylation
(Tyr705) decreased by ~70% in Ptpn11E76K/+ mutant stem cells (referred to as LSCs since they could reproduce
the same hematological malignancy in transplants) compared to that in wild-type (Ptpn11+/+/Mx1-Cre+) control
stem cells. The decrease in Stat3 activity was apparently caused by the accelerated dephosphorylation of Stat3
by the hyperactive Shp2 E76K mutant because Stat3 is one of Shp2 substrate proteins. Importantly, Ptpn11E76K/+
LSCs appear to rely on Stat3 for self-renewal and maintenance - the deletion of Stat3 dramatically decreased the
LSC pool in Ptpn11E76K/+/Mx1-Cre+/Stat3fl/fl double mutant mice. Consequently, these double mutant mice died
rapidly, while none of Ptpn11E76K/+/Mx1-Cre+/Stat3+/+ or Ptpn11+/+/Mx1-Cre+/Stat3fl/fl single mutant mice did. The
synthetic lethality induced by Stat3 deletion in Ptpn11 E76K mutant stem cells raises an intriguing possibility, that
is, diminished Stat3 activity is an Achilles' heel of Ptpn11 mutated (Shp2 hyperactivated) LSCs, making them
vulnerable to pharmacological inhibition of Stat3. We plan to test this hypothesis and accomplish the objective of
this proposal by pursuing the following two aims. 1) To define the role of Stat3 in maintenance of LSCs in Ptpn11
(Shp2) mutated JMML. 2) To test the therapeutic effects of the Stat3 inhibitor atovaquone in the mouse model

Prevalence of oral feeding difficulty in infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is
increasing. This not only leads to prolonged NICU stay, but an escalation of healthcare costs as well. A
major contributor is the increase in large for gestational age (LGA) infant birth rate because of rising
maternal obesity and diabetes during pregnancy. LGA infants are considered poor oral feeders. Significant
knowledge gaps exist in understanding the complex mechanisms implicated in LGA infants with oral
feeding difficulty. LGA infants are exposed to excess energy in utero and body composition studies have
shown that they have higher fat mass (FM) and lower fat-free mass (FFM) proportion. Oral feeding ability
can be influenced by hunger and satiety, which may have a feedback mechanism with the state of the
body's energy stores (FM as proxy) and resting metabolic rate (RMR, FFM as proxy), and these effects
may be mediated through the appetite-regulating hormone (ARH) levels. Our preliminary data suggest that
infants with a higher FM and lower FFM proportion (disproportionate body composition) took longer to
reach independent oral feeds, required longer hospitalization, and required higher g-tube placement. FFM
is better associated with oral (energy) intake than FM, suggesting that FFM is major determinant of energy
intake and appetite in infants. The standard NICU feeding strategy is focused on promoting weight gain
irrespective of birth weight or body composition, which is inappropriate in LGA infants as LGA infants who
demonstrated ‘catch-down’ growth in early infancy had better long-term outcomes. These infants had a
greater proportion of FM loss compared to FFM during the catch-down period. LGA infants with oral
feeding difficulty in the NICU are dependent on tube-feeding and the feeding intake is regulated by the care
team rather than being infant-driven. The lower FFM% in these infants may reduce their ability to meet the
standard oral intake volumes indexed to total mass (150 ml/kg/day). The continued provision of excess
calories above the metabolic needs from tube-feeding may increase their body adiposity, prevent natural
catch-down growth, and exacerbate their oral feeding difficulty. The proposed research will evaluate the
interrelationship between body composition, oral feeding ability, and ARH levels in LGA infants. Further, we
will evaluate the effects of a short-term FFM-indexed feeding (target feeding volume indexed to FFM)
versus the standard approach to feeding (target feeding volume indexed to total mass) on oral feeding
outcomes, catch-down weight, and body composition in LGA infants with oral feeding difficulty. Knowledge
gained from this proposal will provide a rationale for future studies designed to evaluate precision
nutritional therapies for LGA infants. This may ultimately shorten the length of hospital stay and enhance
the quality of life for these infants."

Young adults with cancer need tailored behavioral interventions to improve their psychosocial health. Any
cancer diagnosis in early adulthood can create debilitating life disruptions that increase social isolation that in
turn can compromise psychosocial health. Social isolation also predicts mortality comparably to other well-
established risk factors, including tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, and sedentary status.
This conclusion—described as “unequivocal”—was established by a large-scale meta-analysis and now fuels
the call for low-cost and scalable behavioral interventions optimized for vulnerable populations to increase
social connectedness. The demand for such interventions is especially pressing for young adults with cancer,
whose unique needs have long gone unmet. The broad, overarching objective of this work is to optimize an
evidence-based social connectedness intervention for young adults with cancer and test whether it improves
their psychosocial health. This intervention, delivered digitally and effective among young adults (noncancer
samples), prompts individuals to increase the emotional quality of their in-person social encounters. Our multi-
disciplinary team will carry out a rigorous, randomized controlled trial—the Keep Social RCT—using our
simulated social media platform to deliver intervention messages optimized for young adults with cancer while
collecting repeated measures of day-to-day experiences and psychosocial health outcomes. This program of
research is designed to meet three specific aims. SPECIFIC AIM 1 is to optimize our social connectedness
intervention for young adults with cancer. This aim will be met using a human-centered communication science
approach to enhance the positive reception of health messages with social context cues (human imagery, peer
stories), and conduct an online experiment with 400 young adults with cancer to identify the most effective
intervention messages for use in the Keep Social RCT. SPECIFIC AIM 2 is to pilot, conduct, and analyze the
Keep Social RCT to test whether our social connectedness intervention, delivered via social media, improves
psychosocial health in young adults with cancer. After thorough pilot testing, this aim will be met by conducting
our placebo controlled Keep Social RCT with repeated assessments over six weeks. These data will allow us
to test whether our intervention raises social and emotional well-being (primary outcomes) and improves
resilience and negative mental health symptoms (secondary outcomes). SPECIFIC AIM 3 is to extend data
analyses of the AIM 2 Keep Social RCT to test theory-based mechanisms and explore moderators of
intervention effectiveness to pave the way for further optimization. This aim will be met with statistical modeling
to identify how and for whom our social connectedness intervention improves psychosocial health among
young adults with cancer. Our multi-disciplinary team brings together expertise in social psychology, emotion
science, communication science, and oncology to pursue these aims to produce translation-ready pragmatic
knowledge to improve the quality of life among young adults with cancer in the United States."

Memory impairment is a common and devastating comorbidity of temporal lobe epilepsy. The network
mechanisms underlying memory impairments are poorly understood. Micro-electrode recordings from temporal
lobe epilepsy patients reveal frequent focal epileptic discharges (FEDs) that are only detectable with invasive
recordings. Preliminary studies performed in our laboratory in a chronic epileptic mouse model revealed that
mice experience frequent FEDs while they performed a spatial working memory task. Intriguingly, FEDs
occurred robustly at specific locations on the maze, where healthy hippocampus normally generates population
activity (sharp wave ripples, SWR) necessary for working memory. These data support the overall hypothesis
that the cellular networks that normally partake in memory processes are hi-jacked by FEDs. We will test this
hypothesis with three aims. For Aim 1 we will perform large scale tetrode recordings from freely moving mice to
test the hypothesis that neurons active during FEDs overlap with neurons active during working memory SWR
(wm-SWRs). For Aim 2 we will combine high-density linear probe recordings and chemogenetic inhibition to
test the hypothesis that FEDs are generated in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Finally, in the same
animals as used in Aims 1 and 2, we will perform multi-day 24-hour recordings to test the hypothesis that
FEDS occurring during working memory share cellular and network mechanisms with the early phase of
behavioral seizures. The proposed research could help fill vital gaps in our knowledge about focal epileptic
discharges – both in terms of their mechanisms and how they impact memory processing. We hope to
elucidate which neurons participate in them, develop selective interventions to inhibit them, and determine how
they impact behavioral seizures."

The goal of this proposal is to understand how transitions through pregnancy influence the molecular and cellular
state of mammary epithelial cells and oncogenesis. Numerous epidemiological studies have found that
pregnancy alters the risk of breast cancer. These studies have shown consistently that a full-term pregnancy
prior to the age of 25 is associated with a one-third decrease in the life-time incidence of breast cancer. While a
protective effect of pregnancy has been validated in rodent models of cancer, the underlying molecular basis for
this effect remains unclear.
We have found that pregnancy leads to persistent changes in the epigenome and enhancer landscape of MECs.
Using an inducible c-MYC mouse model, we also find that oncogenesis and the transcriptional output
downstream of this oncogene are reduced in post-pregnancy MECs. In this proposal we will investigate the
molecular basis underlying these robust phenotypes. We will use epigenomics, ex vivo, in vivo and biochemical
methods to define how the transcriptional function of c-MYC is modulated by pregnancy. We hypothesize that c-
MYC interactions with cofactors and with specific cis-regulatory elements are altered in this system.
We will also study how specific chromatin regulators contribute to pregnancy-mediated epigenomic rewiring.
These efforts will build upon our recent data suggesting that EZH2 supports the post-pregnancy epigenome in
wild-type mice. Collectively, this research will provide fundamental insights into the cell biology of the mammary
gland and carry the potential for discoveries that could be harnessed to develop preventative treatments that
modulate breast cancer risk in humans."

Modern cardiovascular (CV) trials often collect data on a wide array of fatal and nonfatal events (e.g., heart
failure, heart attack, stroke, chest pain, and etc.) with different implications for patient health. In recent years,
new methods have started to emerge which seek to capture more events than the traditional endpoint of each
patient’s first event. However, to account for the totality of a composite endpoint while differentiating the
importance of its components (e.g., death vs CV hospitalization) is not easy. As it stands, investigators still lack
adequate tools to measure treatment effects, design future trials, assess risk factors, and build prediction models.
In this project, we address these gaps via four specific aims. In Aim 1, we consider a general class of
nonparametric effect-size estimands defined though pairwise comparison (both overall and subgroup-wise), in
which one component can be readily prioritized over another using a hierarchical rule of comparison. The inverse
probability censoring weighting (IPCW) and augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) techniques are
adapted to U-statistic estimators to correct for censoring bias and to improve efficiency (and thus reduce trial
cost) using patient data both pre- and post-randomization. In Aim 2, we develop routines to calculate power and
sample size for newly proposed methods for composite endpoints, such as the restricted mean time in favor of
treatment and while-alive loss rate, under both fixed and group sequential designs. In Aim 3, we propose novel
semiparametric regression models for composite endpoints following earlier work on the proportional win-
fractions (PW) model. In particular, the generalized semiparametric proportional odds (GSPO) model
accommodates nonproportional win fractions by extending traditional PO models to multiple events with ordered
severities. In Aim 4, we extend survival trees as a predictive tool from univariate to composite endpoints. Drawing
on classification trees for ordinal response, we develop time-integrated versions of the weighted Gini index and
twoing approach for node-splitting, and of a generalized concordance index for cross-validative pruning, thereby
accounting for both the timing and severity of the outcome events. The methods developed will be used for
secondary analyses of the recently concluded INfluenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop cardio-Thoracic Events and
Decompensated heart failure (INVESTED) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02787044). Meanwhile, they will be
incorporated into new and existing R-packages on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN.R-project.org)
for public use by practitioners."
10866531,"The multitude of mechanisms that lead to general break of tolerance and organ pathology in
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have challenged both basic immunologists
and translational researchers. Our studies in people and mice with SLE have documented
molecular mechanisms that account for the opposite production of interleukin 2 and interleukin
17, both of which are being exploited in clinical trials to treat people with SLE. We found that
the transcription factor cAMP response element modulator, which accounts for the opposite
transcription of the genes encoding for these two cytokines, controls also the expression of
ADAM9, a disintegrin metalloproteinase. Early information indicates that ADAM9, a new comer
in the field of autoimmunity, controls peripheral autoimmunity and organ inflammation. ADAM9
is expressed at increased levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes, lymphocytes entering tissues
and tissue resident cells. We have built the hypothesis that ADAM9 controls systemic
autoimmunity and organ damage through distinct molecular mechanisms. Using human cells
and tissues and a series of newly constructed mice and novel technology to alter gene
expression by delivering gRNA in a cell-targeted manner, we will establish that ADMA9 controls
autoimmunity in SLE, that tissue hypoxia further promotes the expression of ADAM9 by cells
entering tissues and its expression by tissue resident cells and how ADAM9 is involved in the
aberrant tissue growth factor beta cell signaling in SLE T cells. Through this work
metaloproteinases are introduced in the field of autoimmunity for the first time. The value of the
work is based on the parallel use of human cells and tissues, novel engineered mice and
cutting-edge approaches to alter the expression of molecules involved in the pathogenesis of

10912724,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunotherapy using CAR-T cells has induced dramatic responses in hematological malignancies, but
extending this success to more common epithelial cancers, which cause the greatest mortality, has proved more
challenging. In a phase 1 trial we conducted, CAR-T cells targeting the tumor-associated antigen ROR1 induced
responses in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia but became terminally exhausted in breast and lung
cancer patients, indicating that strategies to preserve CAR-T function are needed to achieve efficacy in solid
tumors. Recent work has demonstrated that a subset of PD-1+Tcf1+ “precursor” exhausted cells (Tpex) is critical
for mediating successful tumor responses to immunotherapy. Tpex retain a stem-like capacity for self-renewal,
proliferation, and the ability to differentiate into effector-like cells. Interestingly, Tpex preferentially co-localize
with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and reside in tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLN), where they may be
protected from factors in tumors that drive terminal exhaustion, such as more chronic antigen stimulation, mTOR
activation, and hypoxia. Unlike conventional T cells, CAR-T cells are activated by intact antigen expressed on
tumor cells, not by peptide/MHC complexes expressed on both tumor cells and APCs. This design restricts CAR-
T activation exclusively to tumors, where preservation of stem-like qualities may be impaired relative to tdLNs.
To test this, we developed a Kras/p53 (KP) autochthonous model of ROR1+ lung cancer that recapitulates the
dysfunction of ROR1 CAR-T cells we observed in patients. Using this model, we found ROR1 CAR-T cells did
not accumulate in tdLNs and showed faster attrition of Tpex and terminal exhaustion in tumors compared to
tumor-specific T cells (TCR-T) that were cultured identically prior to infusion. Tcf1+ CAR-T cells showed greater
proliferative capacity, stem-like self-renewal, and tumor control compared to Tcf1- CAR-T cells, suggesting that
strategies to preserve Tcf1+ CAR-Ts could significantly improve efficacy. Interestingly, CAR-T cells in tdLNs
formed a small reservoir of “pre-exhausted” PD-1-Tcf1+ central memory cells that we could increase by
vaccination and that may be able to generate more polyfunctional effectors than Tpex, which are epigenetically
committed to producing hypofunctional effectors. We hypothesize that insufficient activation of CAR-T cells by
APCs in tdLNs impairs maintenance of stem-like Tpex reservoirs, resulting in less durable tumor control, and
that using vaccination to increase reserves of Tcf1+ CAR-T cells in LNs will overcome this barrier. In this proposal,
we will use the KP model to determine: 1) whether CAR-T are impaired in maintaining a stem-like Tcf1+ reservoir
relative to TCR-T cells and whether this is due to insufficient activation by APCs; and 2) whether activating CAR-
T cells with endogenous APCs in LNs via a novel vaccine platform will improve numbers of Tcf1+ CAR-T cells,
tumor control, and response to PD-L1 blockade. Our results will reveal whether CAR-T exhaustion in solid tumors
is driven in part by impaired Tpex formation and will evaluate a novel vaccine platform to overcome these defects
that can be translated to the clinic to enhance the efficacy of CAR-T cells in patients with solid tumors."

Oxygen sensing with high precision & high spatial localization can provide new insights into the action and effects
of ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) radiation therapy (RT), known as FLASH-RT. When compared to RT delivered
at conventional dose rates (C-RT), FLASH-RT has been shown to inflict lower radiobiological damage to normal
tissues while still preserving the same tumor killing efficacy. This enhanced selectivity has become known as the
‘FLASH’ effect. Oxygen (O2) has been suggested to underpin the FLASH effect, with several theories centered
on increased consumption of oxygen upon application of UHDR radiation. However, our in vitro and in vivo
oxygen measurements using the phosphorescence quenching method were the first to show that compared to
C-RT, FLASH-RT leads not to higher, but actually lower O2 consumption per unit radiation dose. Additionally,
we have been the first to establish that the oxygen consumption rate during FLASH-RT is dependent upon the
baseline oxygen level within tissue, indicating that the oxygen fixation effect may be oxygen dependent. Based
on these results, we hypothesize that the FLASH effect originates not from fast depletion of oxygen and
radiobiological hypoxia, but rather from a dose rate dependent oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) from
differences in oxygen consumption and damage fixation between FLASH-RT vs C-RT. This original hypothesis
can be tested only with accurate measurement of the acute change in oxygen partial pressure (pO2), as an
indirect biomarker of the oxygen fixation happening. If this is via variation in peroxyl formation, measurement of
pO2 is an ideal surrogate of changes in DNA damage from variations in dose rate delivery parameters. In this
project we will develop a unique high-resolution O2 imaging method to track and optimize the FLASH efficacy by
combining phosphorescence quenching oximetry in vivo with Cherenkov Excited Luminescence Imaging (CELI)
to dynamically quantify oxygen in tissues with spatial resolution of ~1 mm. In CELI, X-ray beams of RT generate
localized optical field, which excites phosphorescence deep within tissues, and the phosphorescence, imaged
with external detectors, reflects tissue oxygenation. This work will pioneer a new approach to oxygen
measurements in RT and will provide mechanistic insight into FLASH radiochemistry with the important potential
to optimize the radiobiological efficacy of FLASH-RT. The teams and resources at Wisconsin, Dartmouth and
UPenn are unparalleled in their experimental potential for this project, and the work will provide fundamentally
new capabilities in guidance of RT, with guidance by key consultants. The components of our work have been
based upon high impact publication of original in vivo data with both electrons and protons. The fundamental
insights that can be gained here are very timely, as the search for the origins of the FLASH effect in normal
tissue is happening now. As we find ways to understand the mechanisms, that can help us optimize its effect,
and test the dose rate beam delivery and oxygenation conditions for tissues that lead to its optimization."

are critically involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Despite being
implicated in pathophysiology of several neurological diseases, the mechanisms through which human kinome
controls neurogenesis and how its dysfunction manifests in disease remain major gaps in the field of
neurodevelopmental biology. In this proposal, we will investigate the role of an autism susceptibility gene,
TAOK2, which encodes a serine threonine kinase, in human neural stem cell development and function. Both
loss-of-function and activating TAOK2 mutations have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
Further, TAOK2 is one of the genes in the 16p11.2 genomic locus, copy number variation (CNV) of which is
the most prevalent genetic risk factor associated with ASD. While work by us and others has demonstrated
compelling evidence that TAOK2 is important for neuronal and synaptic development, the role of TAOK2 in
human neural progenitor cell (NPC) development and differentiation has not been investigated. Further, the
contribution of TAOK2 in the pathology associated with 16p11.2 copy number variation is unknown. Based on
the strength of our preliminary findings, the central hypothesis of this research proposal is that TAOK2 kinase
orchestrates a signaling hub at the centrosome that regulates human neural progenitor stem cell development,
and that perturbation of this signaling pathway contributes to pathogenesis of ASD. We will elucidate the role of
TAOK2 in NPC development through use of 2D and 3D human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) models
(Aim1). Next, mechanisms through which TAOK2 regulates ciliary growth and signaling will be determined
using super-resolution imaging and biochemical approaches (Aim2). The contribution of TAOK2 in the ciliary
defects observed in patient-derived NPCs from 16p11.2 deletion and duplication carriers will be determined
through application of quantitative proteomics and genome editing techniques (Aim3). Utilizing a combination
of innovative approaches and human disease relevant model systems, we seek to understand how TAOK2
kinase signaling mediates neural stem cell development, and how perturbations in its signaling pathways
contribute to the clinical neuropathology of 16p11.2 CNV.

develop PTSD, though the mechanisms controlling this sex-dependent predisposition remain equivocal.
Recently, work from our group and others have implicated protein degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-

Osteoporosis is a major public health problem in our aging population. New bone anabolic strategies to treat
this disease are desperately needed. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a central regulator of calcium
homeostasis. Through its rapid actions in bone, PTH quickly liberates skeletal stores of calcium and maintains
normal blood calcium levels. In addition, PTH also stimulates bone formation, and this property is exploited in
the form of once daily injections (teriparatide and abaloparatide) for osteoporosis treatment. Widespread use of
PTH therapy is limited by the need for daily injections. In addition, we still do not fully understand why
intermittent PTH effectively builds bone while continuous hyperparathyroidism leads to loss of bone mass and
some suppression of osteoblast activity. In this research program, we will understand how PTH stimulates
bone formation and then use that information to develop next generation orally available bone anabolic
therapies. Towards those goals, we recently defined a role for salt inducible kinases (SIKs) as key intracellular
mediators of the actions of parathyroid hormone in bone cells. PTH signaling via cyclic AMP and protein kinase
A blocks SIK2 and SIK3 activity in cells. Accordingly, genetic and pharmacologic experimental strategies that
block SIK2/SIK3 activity effectively mimic the actions of PTH in bone. Here, in Aim 1, we will develop, evaluate,
and test ‘next generation’ orally available compounds that block SIK2/SIK3 action and boost bone formation
and bone mass in preclinical hypogonadism-associated osteoporosis models. In doing so, we will merge
genetic and pharmacologic approaches to ensure that these compounds indeed act via their intended targets
(SIK2 and SIK3) to stimulate bone formation. Having demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of novel small
molecule SIK2/SIK3 inhibitors, next we will define their mechanism of action in bone cells in Aim 2. Unbiased
phospho-proteomic profiling revealed potential control of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and AKT signaling by the
PTH/SIK pathway. This observation may explain why continuous hyperparathyroidism fails to fully stimulate
bone formation by osteoblasts. Here we will study how PTH/SIK signaling intersects with the AKT pathway in
bone cells at the level of cellular energetics, and then use this information to test the model that reduced AKT
activity helps explain bone loss due to continuous hyperparathyroidism. Taken together, these inter-related
Aims will elucidate novel signal transduction models in bone cells and define the mechanism of action of a
new, orally-available osteoporosis bone anabolic therapy."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have improved outcomes in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
and providers may now choose between multiple first-line ICI-based regimens including ICI monotherapy and
ICI with chemotherapy. However, this increase in options has complicated clinical management, with few
biomarkers to guide upfront ICI treatment selection, and incomplete metrics for early on-treatment assessment
of response to ICI therapy. Hence, there is an urgent need for novel analytics tools to optimize and personalize
immunotherapy treatment strategies. While prior biomarker efforts have focused largely on tissue-based
molecular profiling, these have demonstrated limited predictive power and are difficult to implement due to
practical limitations in acquiring pre- and on-treatment tissue. In contrast, imaging and blood-based assays offer
a unique and non-invasive mechanism by which the biology of the tumor and the changes on treatment can be
studied and modeled. Thus, we propose an integrated radiomic-blood analysis to develop predictors of pre- and
on-treatment response to guide the clinical management of NSCLC. Our primary goal is to develop radiomic-
blood signatures for precision immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC by leveraging our expertise in data science,
thoracic oncology, cancer genomics, computational oncology, clinical assay development, and established
research collaborations. Our preliminary data demonstrates our success in utilizing multi-parametric profiling of
circulating tumor DNA to identify molecular phenotypes associated with ICI outcome and disease recurrence,
and in developing novel radiomic subtyping techniques with superior outcome prediction and demonstrated
association with underlying lung cancer biology. Hence, we hypothesize that coupling radiomic and blood-based
metrics can non-invasively inform therapeutic decision-making in NSCLC management while advancing our
understanding of NSCLC biology. To advance this hypothesis, we have assembled a unique set of cohorts of
metastatic NSCLC patients treated with ICI regimens with high-quality radiographic scans, blood samples, and
molecular and clinical data: our in-house lung cancer database (GEMINI, n=5000); a validation dataset from our
collaboration with the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cancer Center (MGH, n=600); the multicenter
collaborative Stand Up 2 Cancer/Mark Foundation cohort (SU2C, n=400), and a prospective phase III ICI trial
(LONESTAR, n=300). Our proposal builds on these unique cohorts and our promising preliminary data to
construct predictive models to guide up-front ICI therapy selection and improve on-treatment response
assessment, while complementary investigations will uncover the biology underlying these clinical predictors. A
major strength of our proposal is our interdisciplinary team’s expertise in developing, validating, and translating
these innovative predictive models toward highly relevant clinical questions. The development of integrative
blood- and imaging-based radio-genomic biomarkers will help improve the clinical management of patients with
metastatic NSCLC while helping progress the field toward a new era of non-invasive precision immunooncology."
10737626,"Cells possess enzymes and proteins that can write (kinase), erase (phosphatase), and read (phospho-specific
binding domains) phosphorylation modifications across the proteome to form a complex signaling system for
regulating proliferation, differentiation, and transcriptional activation. Aberrant phosphotyrosine (pTyr) signaling
underlie many human diseases and the identification of molecular components of pTyr processing has
uncovered fundamental principles of signal transduction and furnished new targets for therapy. A key example
is the oncogenic BCR-ABL fusion protein that exhibits constitutive tyrosine kinase activity resulting in excessive
pTyr modifications to transform cells in cancer. The development of small molecule (GleevecTM) and antibody
(HerceptinTM) therapeutics that target pTyr signaling continues to transform anti-cancer treatment options in the
clinic.
 Despite enormous clinical potential, a critical barrier that remains in the biomedical field is the ability to
assign site specific phosphorylation events to functional changes for therapeutic targeting in human disease.
Technologies capable of overcoming the low abundance and substoichiometric phosphorylation-site occupancy
of phosphoproteins are needed to address the challenge of functional phosphoproteomic profiling. This is
especially true for phosphorylation of Tyr. Compared with phospho-Ser and -Thr, pTyr modifications represent a
rare subset (~1%) of the human phosphoproteome.
 The objective of the proposed studies is to apply a site trapping by covalent probes (dubbed SiteTraP)
methodology to assign substrate specificity to the PTP oncogene, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor
type 11 (SHP2). The significance of the proposed studies is development of a chemical proteomics strategy to
assign substrate specificity – at the protein and pTyr site level – to individual PTPs directly on native proteins in
lysate and cellular studies.
 We will test 2 independent, yet related specific aims directed at benchmarking: (Aim 1) pTyr specificity of
SiteTraP in the presence of phospho-Ser and -Thr in complex proteomes, (Aim 1) Sensitivity of SiteTraP for
capturing SHP2-specific dephosphorylation of pTyr sites in complex proteomes, (Aim 2) Capability of SiteTraP
for capturing global pTyr activation in PTP-disrupted live cells, and (Aim 2) Sensitivity and specificity of SiteTraP
for assigning substrate specificity to SHP2 and determining how SHP2 inhibitors disrupt these networks in live
cells.
 Broadly, our proposed studies will be important for the biomedical community by 1) guiding PTP inhibitor
development for targeting specific pTyr modifications in human disease, 2) revealing differences in active site
and allosteric SHP2 inhibitor mode of action for basic and translational understanding of PTP pharmacology,
and 3) gain a deeper understanding of PTP-substrate networks and regulation in live cells."

based cancer immunotherapy: some tumor cells are resistant to cytotoxicity of NK cells that have a short life span
after infusion into patients. Thus, further understanding of NK cells will be critical to better harness this population
for immunotherapy. Our data recently published in Nature Immunology show that an important transcription factor,
XBP1s, encoded by an unconventionally spliced mRNA of X-box binding protein (XBP1), positively regulates NK
cell survival and effector functions. XBP1s regulates NK cell cytotoxicity and GZMB gene expression via direct
promoter binding. XBP1s physically interacts with T-BET, a master regulator in NK cells, suggesting that XBP1s
can recruit T-BET to the promoters of target genes. This discovery fills a current gap in the field, as T-BET is known
to positively regulate the expression of GZMB despite lacking direct T-BET binding sites on the GZMB promoter.
Moreover, IL-15, one of the most important cytokines regulating NK cell survival, development, and effector
functions, activates AKT signaling to increase stability of XBP1s protein via deubiquitination, leading to XBP1s
nuclear accumulation. Consistent with these human data, conditional knockout of Xbp1 in mice shows a decreased
number of NK cells and impaired NK cell anti-tumor activity. We believe that we have identified a novel IL-15-AKT-
XBP1s signaling pathway that plays key roles in regulating multiple aspects of NK cell biology. Thus, our overall
hypothesis is that this IL-15-AKT-XBP1s signaling pathway newly identified by our group positively
regulates NK cell survival and effector functions and can be utilized to improve NK cell or CAR NK cell-
based cancer immunotherapy. We propose mechanistic studies regarding how XBP1s regulates NK cell survival
and effector functions. We also propose combinational therapies of IL-15/IL-15Rα with CS1-CAR NK cells or with
B-I09, a novel drug targeting XBP1 splicing to XBP1s that has strong activity in treating various cancers including
MM. IL-15/IL-15Rα can selectively stabilize the XBP1s protein and prevent B-I09-mediated downregulation of
XBP1s and the associated inhibition of functions in NK cells. We will engineer CS1-CAR NK cells to express IL-
15/IL-15Rα or XBP1s to have enhanced in vivo persistence of these cells for continuous tumor eradication. Three
Aims are proposed. Aim 1: Study the mechanism and functional consequences of enhanced XBP1s protein
expression levels via IL-15-AKT signaling in NK cells. Aim 2: Study whether and/or how XBP1s regulates NK cell
survival, proliferation, and trafficking. Aim 3: Study the role of XBP1s in combination therapies of IL-15/IL-15Rα
with a novel drug targeting XPB1s, B-I09, and/or with CS1-CAR NK cells for the treatment of MM. Our project is
significant and timely as IL-15 and IL-15/IL-15Rα are top agents for cancer immunotherapy and are being actively
tested in the clinic. Our studies will lead to new insights into NK cell biology, improve outcomes for NK cell-based
immunotherapy, and facilitate developing innovative cancer immunotherapeutics."
10737628,"Atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities are common and potentially lethal if not treated with a
pacemaker. We recently discovered that macrophages inhabit the mouse and human AV node, and that
depletion of macrophages in the Cd11bDTR mouse leads to complete AV block. In the normal murine AV node,
macrophages electrically couple to conducting cells via connexin 43. This electrotonic coupling creates a
source-sink relationship between macrophages and conducting cardiomyocytes. Genetic interference with
macrophage-myocyte coupling weakened AV conduction while optogenetically enhanced communication
improved AV node function. These data, which we recently published in Cell, establish that resident
macrophages augment the fidelity of AV node conduction. We have continued this work by performing survival
studies after macrophage depletion, finding that all mice with AV block die. In preliminary work for this
application, we adopted an implantable pacemaker system for mice, and were able to pace mice for several
weeks. We here propose to use this technique in Cd11bDTR mice. We will conduct studies to better understand
the function of AV node macrophages in order to advance our long-term translational goal to one day develop
macrophage-targeted therapeutics as a new option for conduction disorders. We will implant pacemakers into
Cd11bDTR mice and pace them for up to three months after macrophage depletion. We will test the hypothesis
that, if the mice are supported with a pacemaker, spontaneous recovery of AV node conduction will occur due
to recovery of tissue macrophages. We will test for AV node recovery by ECG telemetry in conjunction with in
vivo electrophysiological and ex vivo optical mapping studies to provide a comprehensive assessment of AV
node function. After recovery, we will isolate AV nodes to investigate the cellular and structural landscape with
special focus on macrophage numbers, subset heterogeneity and spatial distribution by FACS, single-cell
RNA-sequencing and imaging. Using parabiosis, we will determine whether cardiac macrophages repopulate
from circulating monocytes or from tissue progenitors. We will further test whether enhancing tissue
macrophage numbers will influence AV node recovery. Since AV node macrophages are reduced in mice
lacking macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), we will treat macrophage-depleted mice with M-CSF to
test the hypothesis that such treatment will increase local proliferation of remaining AV node macrophages, and
thus ushers in recovery of AV node conduction. We will also explore other growth hormones with influence on
myeloid cell replenishment. In a translational aim, we will study macrophages, other non-cardiomyocytes and
structural remodeling processes in human AV nodes obtained from patients with AV block. Our collaborative
application unites an interdisciplinary team with expertise in electrophysiology, immunology and
bioengineering. While the novel research plan is ambitious, we believe that our preliminary data demonstrate
feasibility and provide us with a unique opportunity to study a question with high clinical relevance."
10927448,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Given the generally incurable nature of metastatic cancer, patients and their family caregivers are at high risk of
experiencing depressive symptoms and spiritual distress (e.g., lack of meaning and peace, despair, alienation).
As caregivers struggle with their own fears and stressors, providing quality support and care to the patient may
be difficult. Moreover, psychospiritual distress is interdependent in families coping with cancer suggesting the
need for a dyadic approach to psychospiritual supportive care. Despite accumulating evidence that highlights
the value of positive psychology interventions in improving depressive symptoms and spiritual wellbeing,
evidence-based dyadic interventions are limited in the palliative care setting. To address critical knowledge gaps
and build upon our pilot work, we propose an adequately powered efficacy trial of a 4-session family-focused
meditation (FFM) intervention targeting psychospiritual outcomes. Patient-family caregiver dyads will be
randomized to either the FFM intervention, a usual care (UC) control group or a dose-matched attention control
(AC) group receiving a social support intervention. To enhance accessibility and scalability for future
dissemination, the FFM and AC interventions will be delivered via videoconferencing. To increase generalizability
of our findings, we will use a multi-site enrollment strategy and recruit families from a community hospital caring
for a diverse including underserved patient population. We will administer all study procedures including the
 Patients and caregivers will complete
assessments at baseline (prior to randomization) and then again 6, 12, and 24 weeks later. Guided by our
exciting pilot findings, we propose a multi-method assessment strategy to uncover a priori intervention
mechanisms. In addition to self-reports, at baseline and the 6-week follow-up, patients and caregivers will wear
a device called the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR), an innovative, in vivo naturalistic observation tool
that will allow us to objectively assess changes in observed behaviors in daily life as a function of group
assignment to evaluate mechanisms of intervention efficacy. We propose depressive symptoms as the primary
outcome given the prognostic value of depression in the survival of metastatic cancer patients and family
caregivers; and spiritual wellbeing as the secondary outcome as it protects against the desire for a hastened
death, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation independent of depression in patients with metastatic cancer. For
families who transition to end of life care over the course of the study, we seek to explore their experiences with
this transition and if the FFM program improves patient and caregiver psychospiritual adjustment at this crucial
timepoint. The knowledge gained from this randomized controlled trial will advance the science of behavioral
medicine, and, ultimately, inform the clinical care of a vulnerable and understudied patient-caregiver population.

The Research Education Component (REC) of the proposed renewal of Penn’s Center for Improving Care
Delivery for the Aging (CICADA) builds upon the major contributions and lessons learned from the CICADA
program’s initial funding period and is responsive to recent dynamic changes in society, aging, health care, and
research methods. Using an equity-first approach, the renewal is designed to strengthen the training and
mentoring of CICADA’s current RCMAR Scientists and expands the program’s outreach to form career-long
relationships with CICADA Alumni. In this renewal, the CICADA REC will provide mentoring and training in
equity-integrated health services research (HSR) focused on aging to RCMAR Scientists from minoritized and
underrepresented backgrounds, with the goal of strengthening diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility
(DEIA) in the field. We target three categories of trainees to become RCMAR Scientists: (1) MD or MD/PhD
clinical fellows who have completed their residency, (2) PhD postdoctoral trainees, and (3) MD/PhD, MD, or
PhD junior faculty, defined as Instructor or early-stage Assistant Professor (<3 years in the role). To help build
our pipeline of promising researchers, we will continue to engage in targeted efforts to identify undergraduate
and graduate students from minoritized and underrepresented groups to participate in mentored research
experiences.
In keeping with our first funded cycle, the CICADA REC will select three new RCMAR Scientists each year
through a competitive call for pilot applications. Each RCMAR Scientist will conduct a 1-year pilot research
project with funding and high-quality, intensive mentoring and training provided by CICDADA REC and
established Penn and Penn-affiliated health services researchers and mentors, focusing on aging and equity-
integrated HSR. CICADA mentors have experience in guiding and nurturing developing investigators,
particularly those from minoritized and underrepresented groups. Once the RCMAR Scientists have completed
their 1-year pilot project, they will remain a part of the CICADA community as CICADA Alumni and continue to
benefit from CICADA's research training, mentoring, sponsorship, and support, as they develop into successful
independent researchers in equity-integrated HSR for aging populations, mentors, and eventual leaders in
academia. To meet its goals, the REC has the following Specific Aims (1) To identify, recruit, and select
CICADA's RCMAR Scientists and support them in conducting 1-year pilot research projects focused on priority
HSR and aging areas of inquiry; (2) To provide CICADA's RCMAR Scientists with structured training and

UIC by building behavioral and social research infrastructure (Aim 1), diversifying the AD/ADRD research
workforce through mentorship and training for early-career Scientists (Aim 2), and supporting pilot research
(Aim 3). The research supported by CHECA will address 3 complementary themes: (1) advancing our

health promotion approaches to innovate our understanding of structural, social, and behavioral drivers of
ADRD inequities and to maximize our intervention effects. In all of its work, CHECA is committed to centering
diverse perspectives, intra-group variations, and an intersectionality lens across overlapping identities (e.g.,
race, ethnicity, gender and sexual identity, class, disability). The Leadership and Administrative Core (LAC) will
provide scientific and intellectual leadership, strategic direction, and administrative oversight to produce
synergy across CHECA cores. The Research Education Component (REC) will provide a mentoring program
for RCMAR Scientists to support their long-term careers, will implement the pilot funding program (solicitation,
review, and selection of pilot studies for funding), and will empower CHECA Scientists with tools and training
relevant to the CHECA themes. The Analysis Core (AnC) will support Scientists' pilot projects through
statistical/methodological consultation and mentoring while also enriching CHECA's methodological
infrastructure accessible to all CHECA-affiliated scholars and faculty members. The Community Liaison
Recruitment Core (CLRC) will provide CHECA Scientists and their mentors with training opportunities and
resources for conducting community-engaged research, and will facilitate bi-directional collaborations between
CHECA and community partners. Establishing CHECA will enable an increasingly diverse cadre of scholars at
UIC to build on our strong track record of research with older underrepresented minority populations locally

10914633,"Project Summary
Racial and ethnic disparities in both economic and health outcomes are pervasive in the United States, so it is
plausible that racial and ethnic minorities may experience worse health and economic burden resulting from
occupational injuries and illnesses. Research on the financial losses caused by workplace injury has relied on
administrative data with little or no information on race and ethnicity, however, and so racial and ethnic
disparities in the economic consequences of workplace injuries have not yet been studied.
This study would overcome this data limitation by imputing race and ethnicity information in a large database of
earnings linked to workers' compensation claims from California. Our key innovation will be to apply a validated
imputation algorithm known as modified Bayesian Improved First Name Surname Geocoding (mBIFSG) to
workers' compensation claims with linked earnings data, allowing us to estimate racial and ethnic differences in
economic outcomes after injury. Our observational research design will use workers with minor, medical-only
injuries as a comparison group for workers with lost-time injuries, a strategy that has been widely used in past
research. This approach will enable us to document, for the first time, whether there are racial and ethnic
disparities in post-injury employment, earnings, workers' compensation benefits, or wage replacement rates.
We will also use Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions and related methods to explore mechanisms that drive
differences in post-injury economic outcomes, focusing on those that are amenable to policy interventions.
The specific aims of this project are:
 1. Using administrative data on California workers' compensation claims linked to unemployment insurance
 earnings data, impute race and ethnicity using the validated RAND mBIFSG algorithm.
 2. Estimate the causal effect of workplace injury on earnings and employment for up to five years after
 injury, and test whether there are race and ethnicity disparities in the economic consequences of injury.
 3. Measure the extent to which racial and ethnic disparities in the economic consequences of injury reflect
 differences in target characteristics such as job physical demands and, workplace job security, observed
 non-target characteristics like age, or unobserved factors (including employment discrimination).
 4. Estimate the degree to which workers' compensation benefits replace lost earnings and determine the
 extent to which benefits and replacement rates vary by race and ethnicity.
This work will advance our understanding of disparities in the burden of occupational injury and illness and the
mechanisms that drive them. Study findings will offer guidance for policymakers and researchers about where
to focus future efforts at reducing disparities. By developing data necessary to study disparities in the nation's
largest workers' compensation system, this project will also build a foundation for future study."
10907737,"Expression of immune check point (ICP) molecules on tumor cells and the host immune
cells, especially T-cells present in the tumor milieu, negatively impact the cancer treatment
outcome resulting in inefficient tumor eradication. Data also exist showing chemo- and radio-
therapy induce ICP proteins on tumor cells and thereby contributing to inactivation of tumor
infiltrating T-cells, resulting in the inability to host a robust antitumor response and culminating in
treatment failure, and disease recurrence. Hence, understanding how a cancer drug impacts
ICP will lead to development of new therapeutic strategies that can circumvent ICP-mediated
treatment failure. One such approach is to incorporate immune check point inhibitors (ICPi)
which can rekindle T-cell response and enhance the efficacy of anticancer drugs.
 Studies from the PI's laboratory and others have demonstrated genetic and pharmacologic
inhibition of the human antigen R (HuR), an mRNA-binding protein that is overexpressed in
human cancer cells, results in growth inhibition, reduction in metastasis, and in increased
animal survival. While these findings support advancing HuR-targeted therapy for clinical
translation, the PI's lab has recently made a serendipitous discovery showing siRNA-
mediated silencing of HuR using a lipid-based nanoparticle (HuR-NP) induced programmed
death-ligand (PD-L)1 expression in lung cancer cells. PD-L1 is one among several ICP proteins
which when expressed by tumor cells suppress T-cell function. HuR-NP markedly induced PD-
L1 mRNA and protein expression in human lung cancer cell lines. Molecular studies showed
HuR binding site in the promoter region of PD-L1. Finally, a negative correlation between HuR
and PD-L1 expression was observed in human lung cancer tissues. To our knowledge, apart
from our own observation reported herein, there are no prior reports demonstrating the ability of
HuR to regulate PD-L1 and testing of HuR-nanotherapy with PD-L1 immunotherapy for cancer.
On the basis of our novel findings, we posit that combining HuR-nanotherapy with PD-L1
immunotherapy will demonstrate superior anticancer efficacy by eliciting strong immune
response, and reducing disease recurrence. We will test our hypothesis with three aims: Aim 1.
Determine the therapeutic benefit of LNP targeting HuR in combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy
in vitro. Aim 2. Demonstrate LNP targeted HuR treatment in combination with PD-L1
immunotherapy in in vivo using lung tumor models elicits immune response and enhanced
antitumor activity. Aim 3. Investigate the molecular mechanism by which LNP targeting HuR
modulates PD-L1 expression in lung cancer cells."
10883645,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Ras/MAPK pathway is activated in 85% of human cancer. Nevertheless, attempts to target Ras/MAPK
signaling have produced only limited efficacy. We hypothesize that one reason for the failure to successfully
target this pathway is that the targeting efforts have focused on the active sites of kinases in this cascade, which
has failed to provide long-lasting benefit. We hypothesize that the failure of this approach results from two
causes: 1) Active site inhibitors, which resemble adenosine triphosphate (ATP), must overcome the exceedingly
high cytosolic ATP levels in cancer cells; and 2) critical kinases in this cascade (e.g., ERK1/2) have distinct
substrate interactions domains that can perform antagonistic roles in regulating cancer progression.
Consequently, active-site focused inhibition is akin to simultaneous depression of the accelerator and brake
pedals of an automobile. We hypothesize that a more successful approach will be to develop inhibitors which
preserve kinase activity, but divert it exclusively to “brake pedal” substrates. In support, we have demonstrated
that the two substrate binding domains of ERK2, termed the D and DPB domains, play opposing roles in the
pathogenesis of JAK2-kinase driven myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Indeed, the DBP and D domains act
like brake and accelerator pedals, opposing and promoting disease progression, respectively. Consequently,
pharmacologic attenuation of the accelerator pedal (D-domain) or its substrates should impair tumor progression
more potently than active site inhibition, because it selectively interferes with the disease promoting activity of
ERK2, while preserving the tumor suppressive function of the DBP-domain. While we have compelling evidence
for the opposing roles of the ERK2-D and DBP domains, the molecular basis for their action remains unclear
and this is an impediment to developing effective, pharmacologic interventions focused on the ERK2 D domain.
We now seek to address this gap in knowledge according to the following aims. We will: 1) Assess the generality
of the opposing functions of the ERK2-D and DBP domains in the pathogenesis of distinct MPN subtypes; 2)
Understand the mechanistic basis by which the ERK2-D and DBP domains exert their distinct functions; and 3)
Assess the efficacy of pharmacologic targeting of the ERK2-D domain and/or its targets in inhibiting cancer
progression. Through these efforts we expect to bring new insights into the role of ERK2 substrate binding
modules in regulating cancer progression and how to exploit this information therapeutically. While we begin with
MPN, these findings may have far reaching implications for other Ras/MAPK driven cancers."

Inflammation, the primary biological response to injury and infection, is essential for survival and under precise
neuronal control. Sensory neurons, which densely innervate all bodily tissues, report the occurrence of
inflammation to the brain, because cytokines and other inflammatory mediators stimulate action potentials. The
arrival of incoming sensory signals stimulates brain neurons to send regulatory signals that return to the body
and regulate cytokine production. The vagus nerve, a major conduit for body-brain signaling, inhibits
inflammation and cytokine production in arthritis, colitis, ischemia, organ transplantation, anxiety-depression,
diabetes, and other conditions. In preliminary studies, we (1) used optogenetics and functional mapping to reveal
cholinergic neurons in the brain stem significantly increase splenic nerve activity and inhibit TNF production via
a significantly specific neuronal pathway; (2) assembled a unique bioelectronic vagus nerve recording toolkit and
nociceptor transgenic mouse colonies to reveal sensory vagus nerve pathways activated by IL-1 and TNF; and
(3) adapted Cre-based mouse lines and virus constructs enabling the functional combination of mapping
activated brain networks and subsequent targeted reactivation of these networks using pharmacogenetics. We
identified brain neural networks that respond specifically to IL-1 and TNF, but the function of these networks on
the development and progression of inflammation remain undefined. Our long-term goal is to reveal brain neural
networks regulating the onset and progression of inflammation, particularly within the setting of inflammatory
arthritis in which sensory neuron activation plays a key etiologic role. The objective of this grant is to characterize
the role for brain neural network activity in arthritis onset and progression. The central hypothesis is that brain
neural network activity plays a critical role in regulating inflammatory arthritis, and the activation of these neurons
regulates inflammation. Despite the clinical relevance and the direct importance to understanding basic
functional neurological mechanisms of inflammation, the role of brain networks controlling the onset and
progression of inflammatory arthritis is completely understudied. Our rationale is that identification of the
mechanism(s) to modulate brain neurons in the setting of inflammatory arthritis will reveal new therapeutic
opportunities. Here, we will leverage powerful genetic, pharmacogenetic, optogenetic, and bioelectronic
approaches for functional mapping and neural circuit analysis to unravel how brain networks are activated by
peripheral signals and how they relay outputs to the vagus nerve to impact inflammatory physiological responses.
We Aim to use (1) our recently developed genetic techniques which we have used to “trap” subsets of neurons
during conditions of activity induced by exposure to cytokines to define brain neural network activity during the
onset and progression of inflammatory arthritis and (2) our recently developed pharmacogenetic techniques to
selectively “reactivate” these same brain network neurons to assess the mechanisms by which these networks
modulate vagus nerve signaling, and therefore, the onset and progression of inflammatory arthritis. The
proposed research is innovative because we investigate the effect of brain neural network activity on
inflammatory arthritis, a previously unstudied mechanism.

Urine culture is the most common microbiological test in the outpatient setting in the United States.
Unfortunately, contamination during collection is prevalent and undermines test accuracy, leading to incorrect
diagnosis, unnecessary treatment, wasted laboratory resources, and inflated costs. Unnecessary antibiotic
treatment increases the risk of developing antimicrobial resistance, one of the most serious threats to patients
and public health. We previously found that more than half of 1,265 urine cultures collected from women and
men in two primary care clinics were contaminated. Prior trials that attempted to reduce urine contamination
using patient education had mixed results. However, these prior studies did not include stakeholder
engagement and were not preceded by pilot studies, a critical step in the process of intervention development.
Until we have an effective intervention, contaminated samples will continue to give meaningless results, trigger
undue antibiotic use, and inflate costs. The overarching goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of
urinary diagnostic testing, thus furthering antibiotic stewardship in ambulatory care settings. We will create a
novel patient education intervention that incorporates stakeholder input and addresses previously identified
barriers to proper midstream clean-catch urine sample collection. Key barriers include competing nursing
priorities, patient language barriers, poor health literacy, and reticence of nurses and medical assistants to
discuss essential anatomic details. To address these barriers, our animated video and pictorial flyer in English
and Spanish will provide step-by-step guidance for urine collection for women and men. The content and
presentation of our intervention will be developed in collaboration with stakeholders central to this process:
patients, nurses and medical assistants. The overall objective of the proposed project is to design and test a
bilingual educational intervention to reduce urine contamination in a diverse patient population visiting safety
net primary care clinics. In Aim 1 (intervention development), we will iteratively develop an educational
intervention (instructional video and flyer) with input from a patient advisory board, nurses, and medical
assistants. The video and flyer will provide step-by-step guidance to patients for collecting a urine sample. In
Aim 2 (pilot study), we will assess and improve the intervention’s acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility
using a mixed methods approach that includes a quantitative survey and qualitative interviews with
stakeholders. In Aim 3 (randomized controlled trial), we will test the effectiveness of our patient education
intervention at reducing urine contamination and antibiotic use associated with urine cultures. The proposed
research is significant because it will develop an intervention to reduce contamination of urine cultures. The
proposed research is innovative because it uses a stakeholder-centered approach. If successful, this
intervention can be disseminated to other clinical settings in which urine culture contamination drives antibiotic
overuse, including emergency departments and long-term care settings."

St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes a spectrum of
manifestations in people ranging from febrile illness to encephalitis and death. Clinical disease caused by
SLEV is indistinguishable from related West Nile virus (WNV). Although critical for understanding disease and
evaluating countermeasures, current SLEV mouse models are limited in several ways. Prior studies used
inbred or immunodeficient mice restricting assessment of the role of innate immunity, intracranial inoculation
that artificially bypasses neuroinvasion, and virus strains that were serially passaged in mouse brains which
artificially selects for neurovirulence. Compared to inbred or immunodeficient mice, recombinant mice better
represent of human genetic diversity which can translate to similar disease to humans. Recombinant
Collaborative Cross (CC) mice that were generated from a panel of 8 recombinant inbred strains represent the
myriad of outcomes in people infected with the flaviviruses Zika, Powassan, and WNV. WNV-infected CC mice
develop a spectrum of outcomes including asymptomatic, symptomatic with central nervous system (CNS)
disease, and asymptomatic with CNS disease, where the innate immune response is the major mediator of
protection from CNS disease. To circumvent limitations of existing SLEV mouse models, the goal of this
project is to develop immunocompetent recombinant CC mouse models of SLEV. We hypothesize that
CC mice model human SLEV including to produce clinical disease, viral tropism, and kinetics that parallel the
spectrum of human SLEV outcomes, and that protection from CNS disease associates with robust innate
immune responses manifest as higher expression or levels of interferon stimulated genes including the antiviral
sensor RIG-I and effector cytokines including interferons (IFN)-α/β/γ. These hypotheses will be tested in two
project Aims. Aim 1: Define SLEV clinical disease and viral tropism and kinetics in CC mice. We will use
CC strains that manifest variable WNV outcomes and inoculate animals via the footpad with a SLEV mosquito-
transmitted doses. We will assess clinical disease, infection kinetics and tropism, and viral genomic changes
that associate with neuroinvasion. Aim 2: Link elevated innate immune responses to control of SLEV CNS
disease in CC mice. We will measure innate responses via gene expression analyses and levels of signaling
and secreted effector proteins and correlate these changes with clinical disease, virus levels in blood and
target tissues, and histopathologic lesions in the brain. Augmented disease in CC mice treated with IFN-
receptor blocking antibody will support IFN signaling as the mediator of protection. This project will develop
new human-relevant mouse models of SLEV which can be further used to study the spectrum of pathogenesis,
define virus-host interactions and host genetic determinants of susceptibility and severity, test interventions like
therapeutics and candidate vaccines, and rapidly adapt to model disease for other new or re-emerging
encephalitic flaviviruses."

Both private entities and academic groups are pioneering B cell editing for therapeutic purposes,
either to express therapeutic antibodies from their native Ig loci, or other transgenes from an
ectopic locus. BCR editing is currently performed with CRISPR/Cas system and a homology-
directed repair template. Non-BCR trasngenes are introduced by retroviral transduction or
transposon-based random insertion. Both nuclease-based and insertion-based B cell engineering
techniques carry risks associated with chromosomal deletion (CRISPR/Cas) or insertional
mutagenesis (retroviruses/transposons). Furthermore, efficient editing is only possible by
isolating and editing B cells ex vivo meaning that therapies based on these editing protocols will
likely be very expensive.
We have discovered a method of B cell editing that requires no exogenous nucleases and does
not rely on random insertion. Our method relies on transducing class-switching B cells with a DNA
template supplied by a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector. The inverted terminal
repeat (ITR) sequences in the rAAV naturally integrate into double-strand breaks created by the
B cell class-switch machinery. With the right expression cassette designs, we can replace the
endogenous heavy chain variable (VH) segment or even express a non-antibody transgene from
within the BCR locus. This nuclease-free technique has potential advantages in terms of safety
and, because it requires only a single rAAV transduction event, it also promises a simple, cost
effective means of editing B cells in vivo.
Here we aim to develop our nuclease-free editing technique and provide proof-of-concept for
therapeutic applications. In Aim 1, we will optimize the design of our rAAV-delivered repair
template, and demonstrate the relative safety of our approach compared to CRISPR/Cas-based
editing. In Aim 2, we test different expression cassette designs for antibody and non-antibody
transgene expression and determine whether or not inclusion of cis-acting genetic elements that
increase somatic hypermutation can enhance affinity maturation of our edited B cells. In Aim 3,
we will address in vivo editing. We will determine whether or not in vivo nuclease-free editing
efficiency can be enhanced by vaccinating mice prior to rAAV administration to drive B cell class

10724258,"Dilated and “burnt out” hypertrophic cardiomyopathies are common genetic cardiomyopathies that lead
to heart failure. Currently over 115,000 Veterans annually receive care for heart failure from the VA Health
Care System. Despite efforts to implement guideline-directed medical therapy, the overall 5 year mortality is
~50% after diagnosis, so clearly this is a disease important to not only Veterans but also the general
population.
 Myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7) mutations are common causes of hypertrophic and dilated
cardiomyopathies. Genetic testing for MYH7 variants have been limited by frequent identification of variants of
unknown significance and the lack of disease-modifying therapies when pathogenic variants are identified. This
proposal will identify MYH7 variants that will cause contractile dysfunction, the first step to the development of
heart failure, and study the disease pathogenesis in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
cardiomyocytes.
 Mutations in either the MYH7 S2 domain or the C1C2 domain of cardiac myosin binding protein C
(cMyBPC) that disrupt the normal protein-protein interaction between S2/C1C2 have recently been shown to
induce heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. This leads to the hypothesis that a subset of MYH7
mutation-induced cardiomyopathies are due to impaired interaction between these two proteins. The proposed
work uses saturation mutagenesis and high-throughput modified yeast two-hybrid assays to identify nearly all
mutations in the MYH7 S2 domain that disrupt normal protein-protein interaction with the C1C2 domain of
cMyBPC. This will assist in identifying all clinically relevant MYH7 S2 variants that are susceptible to
developing heart failure and generate a “look up” table that would enable the confident identification of patients
that could benefit from therapeutic intervention (Aim 1). Abnormally functioning mutant MYH7 protein raises the
possibility of increased myosin degradation. This is supported by recent work demonstrating an upregulation of
muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), an E3 ligase that targets MYH7 and other sarcomeric proteins for
degradation, in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes expressing the pathogenic MYH7
E848G variant. This leads to the hypothesis that MuRF1 upregulation in MYH7 mutation-induced
cardiomyopathies contributes to systolic dysfunction and that reducing MuRF1 levels will increase contractility.
The proposed work will use gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments to elucidate the role of MuRF1 in
MYH7 mutation-induced cardiomyopathies (Aim 2). If successful it will determine if MuRF1 can be a novel
therapeutic target for these genetic cardiomyopathies.
 The proposed work uses several innovative techniques. It combines cutting-edge high-throughput
functional assays with mechanistic studies in genetically-edited human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
cardiomyocytes to identify patients with MYH7 mutations that are at risk of developing heart failure and then
determines the suitability of a potential novel disease-modifying intervention. The high-throughput assays will
integrate well with the proposed training in computational genomics. The method in Aim 1 can later be applied
to interactions between MYH7 and other sarcomeric proteins to potentially identify all clinically relevant MYH7
variants. The mechanistic studies in human induced pluripotent stem cells in Aim 2 will help elucidate the
pathogenesis of MYH7 mutation-induced cardiomyopathies and together with Aim 1 will form the basis for a
future Merit Award proposal during the 4th year of the CDA2 award. Overall, the CDA2 will provide the
additional training necessary for the nominee to use iPSC-based disease modeling with computational
genomics to discover new disease-modifying therapies with precision medicine approaches."

 We are submitting this proposal in response to PAR-20-147 (Extracellular RNA carrier subclasses in
processes relevant to Substance Use Disorders or HIV infection).
 The opioid epidemic in the United States has far reaching consequences for public health. In recent decades,
the rate of newborns born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has increased dramatically. However, not
all neonates exposed to opioids during gestation develop NAS or require treatment. NAS is a complex and
idiosyncratic condition, and it is currently not possible to predict even at birth which infants will require
pharmacotherapy or be susceptible to its worst outcomes. Accessible biomarkers for fetal brain and CNS
development during opioid exposure would be highly valuable for deciding which infants will need opioid therapy
for NAS and making personalized risk assessments for opioid exposed infants. They could also shed light on
the biological pathways that lead to the worst effects of opioid exposure during gestation.
 Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from the Fetal brain and central Nervous system (FNEV) can cross the
fetal/placental barrier and can be isolated from maternal blood. They represent a powerful accessible tool to
provide insight on fetal neurodevelopment and damage. However, EVs are highly heterogeneous, with a diverse
set of surface proteins and intra-vesicular cargo, such as RNA. Current approaches to the isolation and study of
EVs lack the necessary sensitivity and precision to characterize EV subpopulations. To address the current
limitations of EV analyses, we developed a high-throughput single-EV flow analyzer and sorter capable of
detecting single dye molecules.
 This new technical capability allows us to exquisitely define the profiles of plasma FNEV during pregnancy.
Our studies could lead to assays that define NAS risk pre-birth and bring new insights into the mechanistic
pathways of fetal brain injury."

 Each year in the U.S., millions of Spanish-speaking Hispanics experience negative consequences from
harmful alcohol use. Hispanics suffer from alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-related liver disease at rates
similar to non-Hispanic Whites. However, Hispanics with AUD are less likely to receive treatment than non-
Hispanic Whites. Hispanics also face greater socioeconomic, cultural, and linguistic barriers to treatment for AUD
than non-Hispanic Whites. These barriers include limited access to Spanish-speaking providers and culturally
adapted evidence-based treatments. Computerized treatments and mobile technology have significant potential
to increase access to evidence-based treatments in a cost-effective manner for Spanish speakers. A culturally
adapted computerized treatment for Spanish-speaking Hispanics with substance use disorders has
demonstrated efficacy at reducing rates of alcohol and drug use in a randomized clinical trial (Computer-Based
Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Spanish CBT4CBT). Several other clinical trials have supported
the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of English versions of CBT4CBT. Rapid, mobile delivery of CBT skills would
facilitate treatment feasibility during risky periods for drinking in daily life (e.g. weekend evenings). But, CBT4CBT
modules each require 35-40 minutes of sustained attention to complete and cannot be used quickly during high-
risk drinking periods. This project proposes to develop a concentrated mobile version of Spanish
CBT4CBT to rapidly deliver treatment content on high-risk drinking days: Aim 1) Identify Spanish
CBT4CBT module topics associated with greater reductions in daily alcohol use and psychiatric symptoms. Aim
2) Develop a concentrated version of Spanish CBT4CBT consisting of a subset of content from the current
modules. Aim 3) Test the feasibility and acceptability of using smartphones to deliver a concentrated version of
Spanish CBT4CBT on high-risk drinking days.
 To complete these aims, my career development plan includes mentored training in the following domains:
1) conducting clinical trials of treatments for AUD; 2) designing culturally adapted treatments for Hispanics; 3)
delivering treatment components through smartphones; 4) using mixed methods to explore stakeholders’
perspectives on treatments for AUD; 5) fostering professional development through grant writing, publishing,
leadership, and networking. This award will provide me with hands-on experience in ongoing clinical trials of
computerized treatments for Spanish speakers with AUD. I will participate in NIH training programs on digital
technologies, minority health, and professional development, including the MOSAIC UE5 leadership forums. I
will complete Yale University courses on clinical trial methods, qualitative research, and grant writing. These
activities will build on my prior expertise with using mobile technology and advanced statistics to study the
temporal dynamics of motivation for drinking and social processes. This award will support my transition to an
independent research career developing mobile treatments for Hispanics to target drinking in real-time."
10922839,"ABSTRACT: Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the commonest cause of spinal cord dysfunction in
older adults and an important cause of disability and impaired quality of life. Conventional MRI, which is used for
surgical planning, does not distinguish irreversible spinal cord damage and is frequently inconsistent with clinical
examination. Routine clinical assessment for DCM relies on subjective symptom scores, and lacks objective
quantifiable measures of function. Neither of these current standards of practice overcome the disassociation
between radiology and clinical function in DCM, and neither are strong predictors of surgical outcome. To
overcome the lack of pathological specificity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we developed filtered diffusion
weighted imaging (fDWI), which enhances detection of axonal injury. We developed metal-suppression multi-
spectral diffusion weighted imaging (MSI-DWI) to assess post-surgical spinal cord microstructure in the presence
of spinal instrumentation. To better identify the functional correlates of these novel imaging approaches, we
demonstrate techniques to assess subtle sensorimotor dysfunction in DCM. The long term goal of this project is
to incorporate advanced multi-parametric spinal cord MRI in the routine clinical assessment of DCM to improve
diagnosis and prognostication of surgical outcome. The overall objective of this project is to determine if
quantification of spinal cord microstructure and function can disambiguate clinico-radiologic data in DCM and
improve prognostication of outcome after surgery for DCM. The first aim will determine if multi-parametric MRI
measures of axonal injury (fDWI) and demyelination (magnetization transfer [MT] imaging) can outperform
conventional MRI for structure-function correlations. To achieve the second aim, we will use quantitative tests of
motor, sensory and balance function to objectively track functional recovery after surgery and determine if these
measures are superior to standard symptom scores. The third aim will use post-surgical MSI-DWI to detect
microstructural changes in the decompressed spinal cord that are associated with quantitative function after
surgery. Together, the successful completion of these aims will advance the clinical translational of
multiparametric spinal cord MRI for diagnosis, prognostication and monitoring of spinal cord integrity in DCM."

Prostate cancer (PC) patient although initially respond to androgen deprivation therapy, most patients develop
the resistance developing a stage referred to as the Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). Prostate
cancer is a non-inflamed or “Immune desert” tumor where no immune infiltrate is observed, suggesting that
failure has occurred somewhere in the process of T-cell priming, or T-cell trafficking back to the tumor. Not
surprisingly, prostate cancer is highly refractory to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies exhibiting
marginal efficacy in clinical trials, both as a single agent or in combination with other agents. Precisely how
prostate cancer enforce evasion of anti-tumor immune response is not fully understood.
Previously, we uncovered that a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, ACK1 deposited novel pY88-H4 epigenetic marks
in AR gene enhancer, regulating AR/AR-V7 expression. Building on this discovery, we developed a new ACK1
small molecule inhibitor, (R)-9b, which suppressed enzalutamide-resistant tumor growth. To examine ACk1
signaling further, we generated a viable conditional ACK1 knockout (KO) mice, and noticed a significant increase
in activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in KO mice, causing loss of syngeneic prostate tumor growth.
The subsequent studies have revealed a crucial role for ACK1 kinase in the initiation of T cell antigen
receptor (TCR) signaling by phosphorylation of CSK at a previously unknown site, Tyr18. CSK phosphorylated
LCK at Tyr505 promoting auto-inhibition, inhibiting an adaptive immune response. Thus, ACK1 KO mice, or the
(R)-9b injected mice exhibited increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells activation and inhibition of tumor growth. In
addition, (R)-9b functionally reinvigorated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the CRPC patients to
mount robust immune response against CRPC organoids. Together, these data indicate that (R)-9b fulfills a
unique niche, wherein it not only suppresses AR/AR-V7 within the tumor cells, but also activates host immune
system to mount a robust `dual’ anti-tumor response. The specific aims of this project are:
Aim 1: Examine roles of ACK1-mediated CSK Tyr18-phosphorylation in T cell quiescence
Aim 2: Interrogate role of renewed pACK1/pY18-CSK/pY505-LCK signaling in silencing of anti-tumor immune
response
Aim 3: Evaluate therapeutic efficacy of (R)-9b in models of prostate cancer"

The molecular pathways underlying cognition and vocal communication remain largely unknown. The genes and
mechanisms governing these processes are disrupted in many neurodevelopmental disorders, including
intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to study the normal
function of genes disrupted in disorders with deficits in cognition, communication, and social behavior, to gain
mechanistic understanding that can be leveraged for treatment opportunities. Mutations in the gene encoding
the ubiquitin ligase UBE3B have been identified in patients with intellectual disability and lack of speech. The
specific mechanism(s) that give rise to the neurodevelopmental phenotypes and the UBE3B substrates that
mediate these mechanisms are completely unknown. Our preliminary studies suggest a role for UBE3B in brain
development and vocalization. In addition, we identified the branched-chain a-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase
(BCKDK) as a substrate for UBE3B. We propose to dissect the molecular networks regulated by UBE3B
and its role in mediating vocalization, through the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the role of
UBE3B in vocalization; 2) Identify the neuronal substrates of UBE3B through quantitative proteomics and
biochemical validation experiments; 3) Rescue the neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with UBE3B loss
of function by targeting its substrate BCKDK. Together, these aims will identify the molecular networks regulated
by UBE3B that may underlie the lack of speech and other neurodevelopmental phenotypes observed in patients
with UBE3B disruption. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide new insights into pathways
regulating vocalization, increase our knowledge of the specific pathogenic mechanism underlying
neurodevelopmental disorders with communication deficits, and examine new therapeutic approaches."

 Smokers partnered with other smokers (i.e., dual-smoker couples) represent ~2/3 of all smokers. Dual-
smoker couples (DSCs) are less likely to try to quit smoking and more likely to relapse during a quit attempt,
reducing overall smoking cessation rates and representing a high-risk clinical population. Despite their high
prevalence and risk for persistent smoking, however, there are limited data on smoking cessation interventions
among DSCs. Building on previous research that suggests a) financial incentive treatments (FITs) are effective
at increasing quit rates; and b) dyadic adaptations of FITs are feasible for implementation in DSCs, the proposed
randomized controlled trial (RCT) will systematically examine two adaptations of FITs to enhance smoking
cessation among DSCs. In addition to determining the efficacy of these FITs for smoking abstinence in DSCs,
we will examine mechanisms of change, secondary endpoints and outcomes, and the cost effectiveness of each
adaptation. We will address these questions in a three-group RCT that is informed by a highly supportive pilot
trial we have completed on FITs for DSCs (R21CA241570). In all conditions, treatment-seeking smokers who
are part of a DSC (i.e., targets) will receive usual care (combination fast and slow acting Nicotine Replacement
Therapy + quitting resources). In two experimental conditions (single FIT and dyadic FIT, SFT and DFIT),
participants will receive incentives for abstinence at three time points (1-, 3-, and 6-months post-baseline). In the
SFIT condition, only the target in a couple will be offered incentives; in the DFIT condition, both target and partner
in a couple will be offered incentives. Primary efficacy outcome is biochemically-verified abstinence at 6-months
post-baseline among targets. We will concurrently evaluate candidate mechanisms of change (e.g., partner
support, individual and partner motivation) to understand how FITs confer benefits and inform optimization.
Secondary outcomes are point-prevalence abstinence at 1- and 3-months during the treatment and 6-months
post-treatment (12-months post-baseline), as well as partner smoking outcomes. As FITs inherently rely on
financial resources, cost-effectiveness analysis will quantify the cost and relative cost of positive outcomes within
and across conditions. These data on the efficacy, mechanisms, and costs of FITs for DSCs will inform
population level implementation and promote successful quitting in this treatment refractory population."
10737610,"Macrophage (MΦ)-driven inflammation is at the core of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis
(RA), signifying imbalance between circuits that turn inflammatory genes on and off. The `on' state is conferred
by transcription factors such as NFκB that activate basal transcription machinery and chromatin at pro-
inflammatory enhancers and promoters. An equally robust `off' signal is conveyed by the glucocorticoid (GC)
receptor (GR) which, upon ligand binding, tethers to NFκB and represses its targets. Notably, these genes
form distinct classes: those for which RNA polymerase (Pol) II recruitment and transcription initiation are rate-
limiting, and those whose promoters are pre-loaded by initiated but paused Pol II and pause-enforcing factors,
NELF and DSIF. Pause-release requires the positive elongation factor, P-TEFb, a kinase that phosphorylates
Pol II, NELF and DSIF leading to NELF release and productive elongation. Importantly, assembly of the Pol II-
NELF-DSIF `paused complex' is tightly regulated by another kinase, CDK7. To date, the role of post-initiation
control of transcription in immunity and disease is unknown. Our preliminary data in MΦ reveal transcriptome-
wide Pol II pausing and unexpectedly dynamic behavior of NELF upon inflammatory stimulation. NELF deletion
dramatically shifted the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and blunted inflammatory responses
over time. The pausing complex is also a critical target of GC - the cornerstone of anti-inflammatory therapies.
Although basal machinery and chromatin were once considered too general to be `druggable', pioneering work
in cancer research uncovered the benefits of targeting epigenetic regulators and, more recently, CDK7. In RA,
the transformation of the synovial lining into aggressively proliferating cartilage- and bone-invading tissue is
often viewed as malignant. Like tumor cells, synovial MΦ enter a state of transcriptional dependency with a few
super-enhancers dominating the inflammatory transcriptome. These data point to CDK7 inhibition as a novel
promising avenue to treat RA as a monotherapy or in combination with GC. Our objective is to dissect the
specific contribution of post-initiation control to inflammation - in MΦ and in mouse models of RA. Our central
hypothesis is that pausing plays an essential `permissive' role in MΦ-driven inflammation by constraining anti-
inflammatory gene expression. We further propose that genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of Pol II
pausing will yield important insights into the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as RA, with potential
to be translated into advances in patient care. Our Specific Aims are to: 1. Dissect the role of the pause-
release checkpoint in inflammatory gene induction in MΦ; 2. Evaluate early elongation and higher-order
chromatin interactions in MΦ as targets for GR; 3. Assess the utility of manipulating elongation control in vivo
using inflammatory arthritis models. The successful completion of this project will: i) reveal the contribution of
Pol II pausing to inflammatory MΦ activation; ii) help refine the anti-inflammatory actions of GC; iii) uncover the
potential of new therapeutic strategies targeting the early elongation checkpoint in preclinical models of RA."

Improved survival of very preterm infants has not translated into improved neurodevelopment at school age.
One promising neuroprotective therapy is the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) such as
darbepoetin. Preclinical and preliminary clinical data suggest that darbepoetin treatment will lead to improved
neurodevelopmental outcomes in high-risk preterm infants. The NHLBI-funded “Darbepoetin Trial to Improve
Red Cell Mass and Neurodevelopment in Preterms” (Darbe Trial) is a multicenter masked, randomized trial
to test the hypothesis that darbepoetin leads to improved neurodevelopment at 2 years in very preterm
infants. In the current application, we propose the Darbepoetin Kindergarten Development Study
(Darbe-KIDS) in which we will evaluate neurodevelopment in the same children at preschool and
school age. The specific aims of Darbe-KIDS are to (1) test the impact of neonatal exposure to darbepoetin
on neurodevelopment and behavior at 4.0-5.0 and 6.0-7.0 years corrected age; (2) test the impact of
neonatal exposure to darbepoetin on longitudinal neurodevelopment and behavior from 2.0 to 7.0 years
corrected age; and (3) evaluate mediating and moderating factors on the effects of darbepoetin on school
functioning at 6.0-7.0 years corrected age. We hypothesize that preschool children treated with darbepoetin
will have better cognitive, motor, and behavior outcomes at each time point and over time, as compared to
those treated with placebo. Further, we hypothesize that executive function and cognition will be significant
mediators and biological sex and family socioeconomic status will be significant moderators of the effects of
darbepoetin on pre-academic skills and teacher-reported behavior and social skills. Darbe-KIDS builds on
the collective expertise in follow-up of preterm infants among our core group of investigators and at the 16
clinical sites that enrolled children in the Darbe Trial and capitalizes on the existing infrastructure that
supports both the Darbe Trial and other ongoing school-age studies funded by NHLBI. The study is led by a
highly collaborative, interdisciplinary multi-PI team with extensive relevant experience studying the impacts
of ESAs in preterm infants and a long history of successful collaborations in conducting high-quality
developmental follow-up through school-age in large cohorts of high-risk infants. Darbe-KIDS will be the first
comprehensive evaluation of developmental impacts over time and school functioning at school age in a
large, multicenter cohort of school-age children treated with darbepoetin. In addition to providing critical data
about the multidimensional effects of darbepoetin on outcomes through school age, Darbe-KIDS will yield
novel and important data on school functioning in a large contemporary cohort of preterm infants treated in
U.S. neonatal intensive care units. Results of this study will directly impact interpretation of the Darbe Trial
and influence whether darbepoetin should be adopted as a neuroprotective therapy to improve outcomes for
preterm infants."

Radiation induced lung injury is a crucial dose-limiting factor in patients receiving thoracic radiotherapy, affecting
a significant proportion of patients even with use of newer radiotherapy techniques. This proposal investigates a
novel pathway regulating fibroblast activation that can be directly targeted to limit progressive radiation-induced
lung fibrosis. We found that the thromboxane-prostanoid receptor (TPr) was constitutively expressed in human
and murine fibrotic pulmonary fibroblasts and that pharmacological inhibition or conditional genetic ablation of
the TPr markedly attenuated pulmonary fibrosis in mice resulting from ionizing radiation, bleomycin-induced
oxidative stress or Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. Although thromboxane A2 is a major ligand for TPr, we found
that TPr signaling was being driven by F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs), resulting from non-enzymatic, free-radical
oxidation of arachidonic acid. We have demonstrated that ionizing radiation induces F2-IsoP generation in cell
culture and in murine pulmonary tissue in vivo, as does bleomycin. F2-IsoPs are increased in idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis due to oxidative stress in this disease, but whether they are increased in patients who develop
radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF) is unknown, although preclinical and clinical studies provide key
support for the overall hypothesis that non-enzymatic free radical-induced oxidation of arachidonic acid signaling
significantly contributes to RIPF. We hypothesize that a contributing factor is via calcium-induced calpain-
mediated release of TGFβ from the latent complex in lung fibroblasts. The small molecule ifetroban is a TPr
antagonist that has undergone extensive human testing and has an excellent safety profile. Thus, research
validating TPr antagonism in inhibiting RIPF could result in rapid translation via repurposing of existing and safe
drugs. However, there are key gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled before a clinical trial would be
appropriate. First, the therapy would need to work in the context of existing standard of care, including immune
checkpoint therapy. Second, although it is likely that there is an increase in either thromboxane or F2-IsoPs in
RIPF, we need to verify that patients receiving thoracic radiation actually show an increase in one or more of
these molecules. Finally, we need a better understanding of the mechanism by which TPr regulates pulmonary
myofibroblast differentiation and activation in the context of radiation. The goal of this proposal is to fill these
gaps."

Whereas traditional models of transcription cast lysine acetyltransferases (KATs, also known as HATs) as tran-
scriptional coactivators and lysine deacetylases (KDACs, also known as HDACs) as corepressors, an abun-
dance of evidence demonstrates that KDACs can facilitate transcription in a gene-dependent fashion. However,
the mechanisms underlying their transcription-promoting functions are poorly understood. The long-term goal of
our work is to define mechanisms by which KDACs, KATs, and acetylation regulate signaling-modulated tran-
scription. The proposed study utilizes glucocorticoid signaling as a model system. Published studies from the lab
demonstrate that KDACs are required not only for glucocorticoid-mediated transcriptional repression but also for
transcriptional activation of target genes. Preliminary studies show that KDAC1 is required for GR-activated
transcription by multiple mechanisms, depending on the target gene, acting either upstream or downstream of
RNA polymerase II recruitment to the transcription start site (TSS). The next logical step is to identify the KDAC1
complexes involved and investigate their roles in glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-activated transcription. The objec-
tive of the proposed study is to define the roles of KDACs in the dynamics of the transcriptional cycle at gluco-
corticoid receptor (GR)-activated genes. The central hypothesis is that KDAC1-containing complexes act within
regulatory elements and/or gene bodies to facilitate efficient transcriptional initiation and elongation at GR-acti-
vated genes in a gene-specific fashion. This hypothesis will be tested experimentally through three specific aims.
In the first specific aim, the impact of Class I KDACs on the kinetics of transcriptional bursting at GR-activated
genes will be measured, working from the hypothesis that their inhibition will decrease the size and/or the fre-
quency of bursts at KDAC-sensitive GR target genes. This will be tested using single molecule fluorescent in
situ hybridization (smFISH) and live cell imaging of transcription. In the second specific aim, the functional impact
of KDAC activity on transcriptional initiation and elongation at GR-activated enhancers and within GR target
genes will be defined. Next generation sequencing approaches (ChIP- and nascent transcript-sequencing) will
be used to address the hypothesis that Class I KDACs facilitate GR-induced transcriptional initiation or elonga-
tion in a gene- and enhancer-specific fashion. In the third specific aim, the identity of the KDAC1-containing
complexes that facilitate GR transactivation and their sites of action around GR target genes will be determined.
Using biochemical, molecular, and single cell approaches, the working hypothesis that KDAC1 facilitates GR
transactivation in the context of the RCOR and/or NuRD complexes active at regulatory elements or within gene
bodies will be addressed. This work will generate novel mechanistic knowledge of the transcriptional functions
of KDACs that is relevant to basic understanding of cellular processes as well as treatment of disease through
modulation of the epigenome. The study is innovative because it will move this new paradigm of KDACs as
coactivors beyond traditional static models of transcription by incorporating transcriptional dynamics."

tive of the proposed study is to define the roles of KDACs in the dynamics of the transcriptional cycle at gluco-
corticoid receptor (GR)-activated genes. The central hypothesis is that KDAC1-containing complexes act within
regulatory elements and/or gene bodies to facilitate efficient transcriptional initiation and elongation at GR-acti-
vated genes in a gene-specific fashion. This hypothesis will be tested experimentally through three specific aims.
In the first specific aim, the impact of Class I KDACs on the kinetics of transcriptional bursting at GR-activated
genes will be measured, working from the hypothesis that their inhibition will decrease the size and/or the fre-
quency of bursts at KDAC-sensitive GR target genes. This will be tested using single molecule fluorescent in
situ hybridization (smFISH) and live cell imaging of transcription. In the second specific aim, the functional impact
of KDAC activity on transcriptional initiation and elongation at GR-activated enhancers and within GR target
genes will be defined. Next generation sequencing approaches (ChIP- and nascent transcript-sequencing) will
be used to address the hypothesis that Class I KDACs facilitate GR-induced transcriptional initiation or elonga-
tion in a gene- and enhancer-specific fashion. In the third specific aim, the identity of the KDAC1-containing
complexes that facilitate GR transactivation and their sites of action around GR target genes will be determined.
Using biochemical, molecular, and single cell approaches, the working hypothesis that KDAC1 facilitates GR
transactivation in the context of the RCOR and/or NuRD complexes active at regulatory elements or within gene
bodies will be addressed. This work will generate novel mechanistic knowledge of the transcriptional functions
of KDACs that is relevant to basic understanding of cellular processes as well as treatment of disease through
modulation of the epigenome. The study is innovative because it will move this new paradigm of KDACs as
coactivors beyond traditional static models of transcription by incorporating transcriptional dynamics."

Neonatal thymic-derived Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (tTregs) are required for the development of immune
homeostasis and limiting organ specific autoimmune disease. The molecular details of TCR-pMHC
interactions, and the specific downstream signaling pathways that allow neonatal tTregs to develop, seed
peripheral tissues and regulate acute inflammation are not well understood. We hypothesize that a subset of
neonatal tTregs distinguishes health from disease via the expression of TCR with specificity for self-ligands that
are upregulated during inflammatory conditions. This tTreg TCR recognition property manifests as graded
levels of immune suppression based on the context and magnitude of the inflammatory setting. Preliminary
data further suggest that the development of these tTreg clones within the neonatal selection window is
temporally constrained by negative selection, and is predicated on kinetic proofreading, with TCR-self-pMHC
dwell times within a conventional binding mode as a key to specifying tTreg development. To test our
hypothesis, we will first identify endogenous self-ligands recognized by Foxp3+ CD4 tTreg cell subsets. Our
approach is based on our proven ability to identify self-ligands recognized by T cells, paired with mass
spectrometry of MHC-II bound self-peptides presented on APC isolated from different anatomical locations, as
well as high-throughput pipelines for determining recognition properties of individual T cell clonotypes. Using
paired sets of TCR-self-pMHC combinations our second aim will directly examine whether neonatal tTreg
selection is based the dwell time of the interaction, and assess the influence of “unconventional” TCR/self-
pMHC binding modes in selecting the neonatal tTreg repertoire. Aim 3 will identify synergies between self-
pMHC presentation by thymic APCs and the quality of TCR signals generated by thymocytes that define the
neonatal tTreg selection window. Signaling by the Tec family kinase, Itk, is proposed to regulate a signaling
threshold that separates Foxp3 Treg selection from late stage deletion by amplifying pro-survival TCR signals
derived from moderate dwell-time ligands via NFAT and NF-κB signaling pathways. Finally, in mature tTregs,
we propose that Itk functions to amplify weak TCR responses, thereby allowing mature Tregs to recognize
gradients in self-antigen displayed. These studies will provide important insights into the fine-tuning of T cell
responses and the signaling pathways that discriminate effector cells from regulatory cells, leading to rational
approaches in the design of therapeutics to manipulate immune responses for treatments of cancer and
autoimmune diseases.

 Vascular calcification in blood vessels, stiffens artery and predicts adverse cardiovascular mortality and
morbidity. No therapies developed so far directly targeting vascular calcification. Strong evidence has now
determined the osteogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) into “bone-like” cells is critical
for the development of vascular calcification. We and others have demonstrated SMC-derived Runx2 (Runt-
related transcriptional factor 2) is essential in regulating osteogenic differentiation of VSMC, which induces
vascular calcification in atherosclerosis, diabetes and kidney disease. Using single cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) analysis, we discovered a novel Runx2 suppressor and its impact on SMC phenotypic switch in
atherosclerosis. Specifically, we determined that the protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) plays a
critical role in inhibiting Runx2 and modulating SMC phenotypic switch. PRMT1 is an emerging regulator in
human pathological processes, however, its function in vascular calcification and atherosclerosis is entirely
unknown. It is thus incumbent upon us to provide additional evidence as to how PRMT1 acts as a new Runx2
suppressor in the modulation of vascular phenotypic switch and calcification. Prompted by the intriguing
observations of an inverse correlation between upregulation of Runx2 and marked downregulation of PRMT1 in
the calcified atherosclerotic lesions in human and mice, we carried out functional studies using the PRMT1 gain-
and loss-of-function VSMC and our novel SMC-specific PRMT1 transgenic mice. Our preliminary studies
demonstrated a causative role of PRMT1 in regulating Runx2, SMC phenotypic switch and calcification in vitro;
and SMC-specific transgenic PRMT1 inhibited aortic Runx2 and the development of atherosclerosis in vivo in
the ApoE-/- mice. Further evidence implicates that PRMT1-directed regulation of Runx2 is mediated through
methylation of Runx2. Unbiased proteomics analysis of Runx2 interactome uncovered the interaction of Runx2
with serum response factor (SRF), an essential transcriptional regulator for contractile SMC marker genes, which
dysregulates SRF-dependent expression of SMC marker genes. Based on these new and exciting findings, we
hypothesize that PRMT1 is a key Runx2 suppressor, which regulates VSMC Runx2 and governs VSMC
phenotypic switch and calcification in atherosclerosis. Utilizing the new SMC-specific PRMT1 transgenic
mouse model and comprehensive multi-Omics approaches, the proposal will uncover a novel regulatory
paradigm highlighting the PRMT1/Runx2 signaling axis in modulating VSMC phenotypic switch and calcification."
10884922,"Colorectal, lung, and female breast cancers are major public health burdens and there are clear geographic
and racial/ethnic disparities in their incidence. Each of these cancers has been linked to neighborhood factors
including socioeconomic deprivation, the built environment, and environmental pollutants in attempts to explain
existing disparities in risk. While associations exist, most previous studies considered neighborhood exposures
at only one time (e.g., time of diagnosis) and used only single measures of neighborhood exposures (e.g.,
neighborhood deprivation or singular environmental pollutants), which is a simplification of the multifactorial
nature of cancer. As a result, the relative importance of exposure domains is unknown, effects may be
underestimated, and a cumulative assessment of risk factors is lacking. Increasing interest in the exposome
calls for a more thorough assessment of neighborhood exposures over time that could better explain the
factors leading to disparities in cancers. Therefore, we propose to study comprehensive neighborhood
disadvantage (ND), a combination of socioeconomic deprivation, racial segregation, environmental pollutant,
and built environment domains, to provide stronger evidence of neighborhood associations and identify risk
factors that could be modified to eliminate geographic and racial cancer disparities. The important limitations of
existing work that this proposal overcomes are 1) the temporality and extent of exposures (i.e., earlier life
exposure, later life exposure, or cumulative lifetime exposure), 2) the identification of key neighborhood
exposure variables for cancer incidence, and 3) consideration of different domains of the neighborhood
exposome over time both independently and in combination to more comprehensively consider relationships
with cancer. Our specific aims are to estimate exposure effects for ND domains over time and study the
trajectories of these domain exposures and effects by cancer site, race, and sex. We will bring together data
from the Virginia and Pennsylvania state cancer registries, population-based controls, residential histories, and
exposure data documenting historical disadvantage indicators. Highly innovative aspects of our approach
include: 1) examination of historical levels of exposure to several important neighborhood disadvantage
domains and 2) the application of novel Bayesian statistical methods that our team has been refining for
estimating neighborhood disadvantage and its effects. We hypothesize that our novel approaches to estimating
neighborhood disadvantage will better explain variation in cancer incidence than existing methods and will
identify the most influential exposure variables over time for each cancer. This study is highly significant as it is
the first study to estimate neighborhood disadvantage effects for multiple cancers that considers cumulative
risk from several historic exposure domains using residential histories. The expected outcomes of this research
will be the identification of historic neighborhood disadvantage exposures associated with significant cancer
risk to target for policy development and interventions and to help reduce disparities in cancer."

Growing evidence suggests the link between right ventricular (RV) fibrosis, poor function of the pressure-overloaded
RV, and mortality in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH patients with decompensated RV failure (RVF) have
persistent RV fibrosis even when treated with the conventional therapies for PAH. RVF is the main cause of death in
PAH and maintaining RV function in PAH is associated with improved patient survival. However, there are currently no
available therapies that specifically target RV fibrosis. Therefore, identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying RV
fibrosis in PAH is urgently needed to develop novel therapeutic approaches targeting RVF in PAH.
We recently reported the significant roles of o
xidative stress-sensitive protein kinase
D (PKD) at outer
mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and its substrate dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a mitochondrial fission protein, in
dysregulating CM functions. We also showed that DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission limits the size of the matrix
cavity, thus causing elevated and sustained mitochondrial Ca2+ (mtCa2+) transient in response to cytosolic Ca2+ elevation.
Using a preclinical rat PAH model with RV hypertrophy, failure, and fibrosis that significant
, we found
PKD activation
and DRP1 phosphorylation occurs specifically
in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in the RV (RV-CFs), but not in CMs under
PAH, which subsequently causes an PKD-dependent increase in mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (mROS), and CF proliferation. Moreover, we found that PKD activation is associated with increased
phosphorylation of a pro-apoptotic protein Bax, which inhibits apoptotic pore formation in the OMM and potentially
contributes to the anti-apoptotic phenotype of RV-CFs in PAH. Lastly, we also found that mtCa2+ uptake via mtCa2+
uniporter (MCU) is required for mROS elevation and subsequent activation of proliferative signaling in CFs. Based on
these findings, we hypothesize that 1) PKD-dependent Bax phosphorylation allows RV-CFs to be resistant to apoptosis
under PAH; 2) PKD-dependent mitochondrial fission limits mtCa2+ and antioxidant capacity by decreasing the size of
the matrix cavity and causing increased mtCa2+ and mROS levels, thus acting as a molecular “switch” for proliferative
signaling for RV-CFs in PAH; and 3) CF-specific inhibition of PKD at the OMM in vivo can be leveraged as a novel
therapy to attenuate cardiac fibrosis in response to stress/injury such as PAH. In Aim 1, we will establish Bax as a novel
PKD substrate in the mitochondria and assess the impact of PKD-dependent Bax phosphorylation on OMM permeability.
To specifically inhibit PKD activity only at the OMM, we will use an OMM-targeted dominant-negative PKD1 (mt-PKD-
DN) that we have newly validated. In Aim 2, we will test whether PKD-dependent enhancement of mitochondrial fission
facilitates RV-CF proliferation via increased mtCa2+ and mROS levels. In Aim 3, we will test the therapeutic potential of
mitochondrial PKD inhibition by mt-PKD-DN in the quiescent CFs before they transform into myofibroblasts by CF-
specifically expressing mt-PKD-DN in a preclinical rat PAH model.
The proposed project is designed to determine the
role of mitochondrial fission, Ca2+, and mROS in RV-CF hyperproliferation and RV fibrosis in PAH, which will lead to
develop a novel strategy (i.e., PKD inhibition) for the management of RV fibrosis and failure in the setting of PAH."
10845633,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over one in three Americans regularly sleep less than the recommended 7 hours per night. Alarmingly, adults who maintain
habitual short sleep durations (HSSD), such as medical and military personnel, emergency responders, shift workers, and
students, are alarmingly ~30% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) versus adults who maintain adequate sleep
durations. Furthermore, data show that experimentally imposed sleep restriction lasting ~3 days to 2 weeks can impair
insulin sensitivity to levels commonly observed in people with pre-diabetes or in aging. However, it is not known if data
from rigidly controlled laboratory studies of experimental sleep restriction translates to people with real-world naturalistic
HSSD. Furthermore, neither the existing data from epidemiological nor laboratory-controlled studies inform mechanisms
or potential health benefits of interventions targeting HSSD. Molecular biomarkers that link risk of T2D with HSSD
could help overcome these knowledge gaps by: (1) identifying mechanisms underlying risk of T2D linked to real-
world HSSD and (2) informing whether sleep extension reverses such risk. Our preliminary data identified ceramides
as important candidate biomarkers that link risk of T2D with short sleep duration. Ceramides are central intermediate lipids
in sphingolipid metabolism and are particularly deleterious as they induce insulin resistance and are consistently
associated with incidence of cardiometabolic disease including T2D. Thus, our central hypothesis is that ceramides are
biomarkers that link risk of T2D with HSSD, and sleep extension is expected to lower plasma ceramides and improve
insulin sensitivity. To test our central hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial with real-world sleep
extension in overweight and obese adults with HSSD. Participants will complete 1 week of baseline monitoring and then
be randomized to either sleep extension (target ≥8 hours of nightly time in bed) or HSSD maintenance for 8 weeks at home
(intervention segment). Following the baseline and intervention segments participants will complete rigorous overnight
laboratory visits to assess plasma ceramides (targeted metabolomics assay) and insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic-
euglycemic clamp). Aim 1 will determine the impact of sleep extension on plasma ceramides and Aim 2 will determine
the impact of sleep extension on insulin sensitivity. Our expected findings will advance the field by identifying biomarkers
that link risk of T2D with HSSD and informing whether sleep extension reverses such risk. This knowledge could improve
our ability to quantify, track, and reduce an individual’s risk of T2D over time, which could be especially impactful for
people who are less successful with current diet and physical activity-based interventions. If effective, sleep extension would
therefore help improve quality of life and reduce the health and economic burdens of T2D on society."
10883646,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer cells express high levels of PD-L1, a ligand of the PD-1 receptor on T-cells, allowing tumors to
directly suppress T cell activity. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies induce potent anti-tumor immunity and have been
approved as a first-line therapy for lung cancer. However, only ~20% of all non-small cell lung cancers
(NSCLCs) benefit from checkpoint blockade. A further understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the
immune checkpoint in lung cancer is therefore needed. To address this, my laboratory used CRISPR-based
screening to identify regulators of PD-L1 in lung cancer cells, revealing potent induction of PD-L1 upon
activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Mechanistically, ISR activation resulted in
enhanced PD-L1 translation and suppression of anti-tumor immunity. We further demonstrated that ISR-
dependent translation of PD-L1 requires the alternative translation initiation factor eIF5B. The canonical role of
this GTPase is to catalyze ribosomal subunit joining, ensuring 80S ribosome assembly and efficient start codon
selection. eIF5B overexpression and/or amplification is frequent in human lung cancers and is associated with
poor prognosis. Remarkably, eIF5B overexpression is sufficient to induce PD-L1 protein levels even in the
absence of ISR activation. These findings uncovered a new mechanism of immune checkpoint activation and
suggested that eIF5B may be a novel target for lung cancer intervention. We further demonstrated that
enforced expression of eIF5B accelerates proliferation in lung cancer cells, in mouse syngeneic models, and in
human bronchial epithelial cells suggesting that it also promotes tumor growth in a cell-autonomous manner.
We propose to elucidate the role of eIF5B in lung tumorigenesis by testing the following central hypothesis:
EIF5B functions as an oncogene in human lung cancer by inducing PD-L1 translation and by driving a
tumor-promoting translational program. Three Specific Aims will be pursued in order to test this
hypothesis: In Aim 1, we will dissect the mechanisms through which eIF5B promotes translation of PD-L1 and
additional oncogenic mRNAs in lung cancer. In Aim 2, we will functionally evaluate the oncogenic activity of
eIF5B using a novel transgenic mouse model with conditional eIF5B overexpression. In Aim 3, we will
characterize the effects of eIF5B loss of function on cell autonomous tumor growth versus its effect on T cell
responses in the KrasLSL-G12D; Tp53 fl/fl mouse model using a newly generated conditional floxed knockout
allele and a heterozygous germline knockout mouse. These aims will take advantage of our expertise, and
that of our collaborators, to evaluate eIF5B oncogenic activity, and elucidate the mechanisms through which
this translation initiation factor promotes lung tumorigenesis. We anticipate that these studies will provide new
insights into mechanisms of translational control in tumor progression and immune evasion."
10932302,"Project Summary/Abstract
Burn care in older adult patients has been extremely challenging. Not only do elderly burn patients have an
increased susceptibility to burns, but more importantly, they have a substantially increased morbidity and
mortality compared to adults. The cause and underlying mechanisms for these adverse outcomes are
essentially unknown. We recently conducted several studies in older adult burn patients and aged mice to
understand the pathophysiology after a burn. We found that older adult burn patients are hypo-inflammatory
and hypometabolic. It, therefore, appears that elderly burn patients cannot initiate ubiquitous life-saving
responses to burn. As we have recently shown that the adipose tissue is a central mediator for post-burn
immune-metabolic responses, we investigated the response of the adipose tissue after a burn in older adult
burn patients and aged mice. We found that older adult burn patients have an absence of the adipose tissue
adaptive response, namely the browning of the adipose tissue and its ensuing immune-metabolic responses.
Looking at a more molecular level, we found that older adult burn patients have profound mitochondrial
dysfunction and depleted NAD levels. These findings indicate that the structure and the immune-metabolic
function of the adipose tissue are substantially different in older adults compared to adults after a burn leading
us to hypothesize that the adipose tissue is a central mediator in the post-burn response of older adults. To
enable mechanistic studies, we conducted several experiments to determine if the previously mentioned
phenomena can be recapitulated in aged mice. We found that aged mice underwent the same functional and
structural changes of the adipose tissue and very similar immune-metabolic responses compared to older adult
burn patients. Therefore, we concluded that aged mice could be used for our proposed studies, allowing
translation from aged mice to older adult patients. Our overarching hypothesis is that the adipose tissue and its
ensuing immune-metabolic responses are central to survival in burn patients. The dysfunctional adipose tissue
found in older adult burn patients is one of the key mechanisms resulting in poor outcomes in this patient
population."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, which includes chronic bronchitis and
emphysema) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are both common diseases with major
cardiovascular sequelae. The concomitant presence of COPD and OSA is referred to as overlap
syndrome (OVS), which has a very poor prognosis with his risk of cardiovascular mortality. Our
data demonstrate an association between OSA treatment and improved mortality in individuals
with OVS, but to date data are not definitive and underlying mechanisms are undefined. In theory,
in individuals with baseline (sustained) hypoxemia, further intermittent hypoxemia due to OSA
may promote pulmonary vasoconstriction and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Thus, the
right ventricle (RV) may be particularly affected by OVS. Of note, we have robust preliminary data
showing the impact of OVS on the RV and reversibility with intervention. To investigate these
concepts further, we propose two specific aims. First, we will perform a cross-sectional study to
compare specific markers of cardiovascular risk among those with OSA vs. COPD vs. OVS. This
aim will test the hypothesis that OVS has worsen endothelial function as compared with
individuals afflicted with either disease alone. We will quantify other markers of cardiovascular
risk such as cardiac MRI and plasma biomarkers including novel microRNAs. We have recent
prominent publications suggesting a major role of miR-210 in the pathogenesis of OSA induced
vascular risk. We will also employ novel imaging methods to assess potential biomarkers for
mechanistic insights and to identify robust surrogate outcome measures for subsequent studies.
Second, we will perform a mechanistic clinical study to compare the improvement in RV mass
among individuals who receive bi-level positive airway pressure (PAP) as compared to individuals
who receive oxygen (O2), which is the current standard of care. This aim will test the hypothesis
that bi-level PAP therapy improves markers of cardiovascular risk as compared with O2 therapy.
In addition to cardiac MRI we will assess other biomarker of cardiovascular risk as in Aim 1. Such
findings will lay the groundwork for a multicenter randomized controlled trial, which we believe will
be required to change the current standard of care. Our proposal will also inform basic research
on the interactions of sustained plus intermittent hypoxemia. Given the high vascular risk among
these individuals, the very high population prevalence of disease and the lack of current data,
further mechanistic research is imperative."

10914241,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The essence of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) phenotype is a decline in memory. Well before the onset of
obvious dementia, there are changes in memory that patients and family members notice which diminish
quality of life for those impacted. Therapeutic interventions that target the presymptomatic and early
symptomatic stages of AD often choose a cognitive endpoint to demonstrate efficacy, but conventional
memory assessments often fail to capture these subtle changes that occur early in the disease. One reason is
that conventional memory assessments do not reflect how memory is relied upon in the everyday lives of
participants. For example, it is very distressing for patients to experience memory lapses like forgetting first
names, losing personal items, or having difficulty remembering the plot of a book or film. Conventional memory
testing assesses recall at short periods, typically 30-minutes or less after learning the information, whereas in
the everyday lives of patients, critical information must be recalled over much longer periods like hours, days,
or even weeks to maintain quality of life. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that extending recall of
newly learned information past the usual 30-minute or less delay period to much longer intervals dramatically
increases the rate of decay, a concept known as accelerated long-term forgetting (ALF). We have shown that
participants who carry a mutation for autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease (ADAD) but who are
presymptomatic, perform similarly to non-carriers on conventional memory testing. Critically, when we tested
mutation carriers on their long-term recall at 7 days, they had lost much more information than non-carriers,
suggesting that extending the recall period may reveal important differences in memory consolidation that
manifest well before the onset of noticeable dementia symptoms.
 An obvious challenge for measuring ALF in clinical populations is burden. Conventional testing would
require multiple visits from study participants and require multiple interactions with study personnel, which is
practically and financially unfeasible. The increasing ubiquity of smartphones provides an opportunity to assess
cognition in populations at risk for AD, while allowing for longer-term follow-up without excessive burden or
financial impact. In this study, we will develop novel ALF measures for smartphone-based administration and
validate their effectiveness in presymptomatic autosomal dominant AD. Our development process will include
user experience studies and clinical trial readiness audits, and the resulting application source code will be
made freely available. The ultimate goal is to develop a highly sensitive, accessible, and clinically meaningful
cognitive endpoint for use in international AD clinical trials, including adding ALF measures to the Dominantly
Inherited Alzheimer Network-Trials Unit (DIAN-TU)."

The prevalence of diabetes has rapidly risen during the last decades at an alarming rate, and more than 54.9
million Americans (15.3% of the population) are predicted to suffer from diabetes by 2030. Diabetic patients are
highly susceptible to bone infections (osteomyelitis) and have poor bone regeneration capacity, placing them at
a risk of amputations that dramatically impacts the quality of life. Even though osteomyelitis is one of the oldest
diseases in human history, the existing medical approach to treat infected bone still has serious limitations while
encountering new challenges. The effectiveness of the current treatment approach of debridement of the bone
followed by antibiotics application is critically limited by (a) the formation of strongly assembled bacteria (biofilm)
that are difficult to remove, (b) evolution of bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics, and (3) non-degradability
of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement, which is used to locally deliver antibiotics but requires
additional surgery to remove it afterward and is bioinert with potential toxicity of unreacted monomers. Therefore,
there is a significant unmet medical need for the development of a next-generation antibiotic and an advanced
antibiotic delivering system that can effectively cure the infection and improve the recovery of bone tissue.
To solve this important problem, in this project, we aim to develop an innovative drug-device combination based
on a novel dual-targeting antibiotic that can effectively retard bacteria resistance and an advanced biodegradable
nanostructured bone cement that can induce a sustained release of antibiotics and enhance bone regeneration.
We propose (1) to use whitlockite (WH) nanoparticles to develop a next-generation biodegradable bone cement,
leveraging the excellent bone regeneration capacity and biodegradability of WH nanoparticles. WH also has a
highly functionalized surface and can form nanostructured cement that can provide a large binding site for
antibiotics; (2) to rationally develop next-generation antibiotics to have enhanced bactericidal capacity and
compatible with our new degradable bone cement via computer-aided design and multiple screening processes.
This is a significant advance from currently used antibiotics, which were originally never developed for bone
infection or delivery from bone cement. We have already demonstrated that our preliminary model of dual-action
antibiotics can significantly retard the evolution of bacterial resistance and is effective against biofilms; and (3)
to validate the therapeutic efficacy of our dual-targeting antibiotic-impregnated WH bone cement in a diabetic
osteomyelitis model in vivo by evaluating bone regeneration rate and conducting a comprehensive toxicological
test. We envisage that this project will generate the first rationally designed antibiotic-delivering biodegradable
cement that can treat biofilms, overcome drug resistance and regenerate the bone, thereby addressing a major
clinical need. This research will also be beneficial for inhibiting infections in general orthopedic surgeries and
thus, can lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment of bone infection."

Aging is one of the major risk factors for the development and progression of cerebrovascular, cardiovascular,
and neurodegenerative diseases, contributing to long-term disability and mortality in the elderly. Aging-
associated progressive structural and functional decline of vascular cells lead to vascular dysfunction such as
decreased cerebral blood flow. While the vasculature is one of the most important targets of aging, it is not
clear whether accumulating vascular pathologies or aging drives vascular dysfunction. The overall long-term
goal of this project is to elucidate aging, and brain hypoperfusion-associated temporal changes in the cerebral
vasculature. We will test the hypothesis that brain hypoperfusion exacerbates aging-associated compromised
blood-brain-barrier integrity facilitated by mitochondrial dysfunction. To test our overall hypothesis, we
proposed two specific aims. We will use young and old, male, and female mito-Dendra2 expressing and wild
type mice in the proposed studies. Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) will be used to mimic
cerebral hypoperfusion. The therapeutic potential of vascular mitochondria will be tested using a mitochondria
targeted tetrapeptide. Two-photon microscopy will be used to determine how hypoperfusion exacerbates
aging-associated BBB dysfunction in vivo, to map the brain vasculature, and vascular mitochondrial dynamics
real time. Our studies will be complemented with immunofluorescence studies, discovery-based proteomics
approach, and Western blot. The proposed research will reveal how aging and cerebral hypoperfusion affect
endothelial mitochondria, and will elucidate mechanisms that might contribute to aging-related pathologies
such as Alzheimer’s disease."
10922868,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The impact of suicide reaches well-beyond individual suicide decedents. For each suicide death, an estimated
135 people are exposed to the potential trauma of suicide loss. Research indicates that exposure to suicide
loss can result in mental and physical health distress, with those experiencing adverse outcomes called
“suicide loss survivors.” At the same time, the literature is severely limited by a lack of appropriate comparison
groups (e.g., accident death loss), examining a limited number of outcomes without considering comorbidity,
and focusing on one type of familial relation (e.g., spouses) while ignoring non-familial loss survivors (e.g.,
cohabitants). Consequently, the lack of high-quality population-level longitudinal epidemiologic studies of
suicide loss survivors hinders our ability to understand the full health effects of suicide and the full extent of the
suicide public health crisis. The overall goal of this project is to use Danish national registry data to document
the mental and physical health outcomes and comorbidities among the population of individuals exposed to
suicide loss over a 30-year period. Denmark has a universal healthcare system, with government supported
nationwide electronic health and social registries, and the ability to link records across registries and
individuals using unique personal/family identifiers and address information. Our project will leverage the
registries to directly address gaps in the suicide loss literature. We will develop a cohort of all first-degree
relatives and cohabitants exposed to suicide loss between 1994 and 2024, as well as two comparison cohorts
(1) exposed to accident loss, and (2) from the general population (Aim 1). The cohorts will include all available
socio-demographic and electronic medical record data over the 30-year follow-up period. These data will be
used to conduct an epidemiologic outcome-wide analysis of suicide loss (Aim 2). We will identify all mental and
physical health ICD-coded diagnostic outcomes that are specific to suicide loss (compared to accident loss and
the general population), and examine how outcomes vary by time since loss, relationship type, and sex. This
approach will inform novel and more precise targets for prevention and intervention within the field of suicide
postvention. The cohort also will be used to identify the most salient patterns of diagnostic comorbidity that
follow suicide loss (Aim 3). Unsupervised machine learning will identify latent subgroups of suicide loss
survivors characterized by common patterns of mental and physical health comorbidity, with the goal of
informing transdiagnostic prevention/treatment and generating mechanistic hypotheses. This study is an
efficient way to lay a foundation for the epidemiology of suicide loss. Our results will provide clinicians and
policymakers with the information needed to design and study both disorder-specific and transdiagnostic
interventions to prevent and treat currently unexplored and underexplored effects of suicide on loss survivors.
The cohort also can serve as an enduring resource for future research on suicide loss. Going forward, results
can be replicated across other populations (e.g., smaller US samples) to further contextualize our findings."
10851940,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is the most common
liver disease in the United States and it increases the risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Prior
research shows that dysregulated lipid partitioning in liver mitochondrial oxidative metabolism pathways [i.e.,
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and ketogenesis] is fundamental to liver
steatosis and oxidative stress that underlie NAFLD. A traditional view of mitochondrial lipid partitioning is that
lipids are fated to ketogenesis when the capacity of terminal oxidation (TCA cycle and OXPHOS) is exceeded,
but ketogenesis is limited when the TCA cycle and OXPHOS can support terminal oxidation or under states of
high hepatic energy demand. However, this dualist view of lipid partitioning fails to describe heterogeneity in
mitochondrial function across the NAFLD spectrum and reveals knowledge gaps in our understanding of how
liver mitochondria may coordinate lipid catabolism. The objective of this project is to test the innovate premise
that ketogenesis actively supports TCA cycle function and that loss of this salutary coupling contributes to
NAFLD. This is based on our preliminary data from mouse models of varying NAFLD severity. Initial studies
used phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT)-null mice that exhibit NASH owing to reduced
phosphatidylcholine, which is characteristic of human NASH. PEMT-null mice showed lower liver NAD+ and
molecular indices of terminal oxidation, however, in vivo TCA cycle flux was unaltered and ketogenesis was
increased. This phenotype in mice mimics our preliminary data in humans with NASH which showed elevated
ketogenesis and preserved TCA cycle flux. Notably, PEMT-null mice fed a high-fat diet and wild type mice fed
a ketogenic diet had lower liver nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), which may lead to greater NAD+
salvage to facilitate TCA cycle flux that would otherwise be impaired. In addition, knockdown of ketogenic
enzyme 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) in mice on a high-fat diet resulted in lower liver
ketogenesis (as expected) and NAD+. Our central hypothesis is that ketogenesis enhances TCA cycle flux via
acute and chronic NAD+ provision under conditions of excess lipid availability. This hypothesis will be tested
via two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will demonstrate that a ketone body-NNMT-NAD+ axis mitigates liver steatosis by
promoting TCA cycle flux in NASH. Mice lacking liver HMGCS2 will receive a Gubra Amylin NASH (GAN) diet
and will be independently crossed with liver-specific NNMT knockout mice or provided nicotinamide riboside to
increase NAD+. Aim 2 will determine that an increased NAD+/NADH ratio supported by ketogenesis facilitates
lipid disposal in response to exercise. HMGCS2 and β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 will be deleted in
livers of mice fed a GAN diet to impede ketogenesis and NAD+ provision. Acute and chronic exercise protocols
will be completed. Impact: This project will lead progress in creating a paradigm shift by advancing our
understanding of how ketogenesis facilitates lipid disposal and informing new therapies for preventing NASH."
10849829,"Despite the increasing availability of monoclonal antibody (mAb) drugs and their proven success in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and many other diseases, the early identification of the protein candidate molecules with desirable manufacturability, stability and delivery attributes remains a big challenge. Self-association and poor solution behavior, manifested in high viscosity/opalescence at relevant concentrations or in phase separation and stability issues, are major limiting factors in development of mAb therapeutics. Solution behavior is believed to be governed by protein self-association, however, measurement of these associations experimentally and prediction of the solution behavior are challenging using the current methods. The objective in this application is to develop a versatile method that directly measures the protein self-association under relevant conditions and is predictive of the important attributes in drug development and formulation. This proposal is significant because it increases the potential to identify the candidates with weak solution behavior and susceptibility to aggregation which, in turn, can lead to enhanced efficiency in development of much needed mAb therapeutics. In addition, having reliable predictive methods at the early stages of drug discovery and development would eliminate the early, unwarranted removal of therapeutically promising mAb drug candidates from development pipelines."
10724253,"Staphylococcus aureus is a gram positive bacteria that possesses a multitude of virulence
factors. It is a frequent and severe pathogen in hospitals and of increasing concern in the
community, where it results in severe skin infections, pneumonia, sepsis and lethal
bacterial endocarditis. A significant proportion of these infections are the result of
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). We have developed a highly immunogenic
prototype nanoparticle vaccine capable of rapidly eliciting antibody against the pore
neutralizing determinant (PND) within alpha toxin (AT), a ubiquitous and critical
virulence factor of MRSA. Previous work has demonstrated that Ab against the PND is
highly efficacious in preventing tissue injury and bacterial growth in a rigorous mouse
dermonecrosis model, and in protecting mice in a lethal model of S. aureus pneumonia.
In this project, we will utilize the human hepatitis core antigen platform to develop
nanoparticle vaccines capable of neutralizing the key leukotoxins including gamma
toxin, Panton Valentine leukocidin, LukED and LukGH, which are critical, secreted
virulence factors which enable S. aureus to evade host immunity, and a nanoparticle
vaccine targeting the previously validated PND of AT. The vaccines emerging from
these studies will be uniquely effective against MRSA infections and will ideally be the
basis of an efficacious, multivalent nanoparticle vaccine for MRSA."

10737629,"Abstract
Breast cancer recurrence remains a significant risk among node-positive patients. Breast cancer stem or stem-
like cells (BCSCs herein) disseminate and evade first-line therapies, and account for high mortality among
patients with advanced endocrine-resistant disease. The objective of this proposal is to define the signaling
pathways that drive the emergence and expansion of endocrine-resistant BCSCs, with the goal of blocking
epigenetic events to specifically target this population of tumor cells. Filling this knowledge gap will pave the way
for intervention that blocks BCSCs and ensures long-term disease-free survival. We identified the chromatin-
associated, steroid receptor (SR) transcriptional coregulator, PELP1, as a mediator of BCSC expansion. Utilizing
mass spectrometry, we identified the steroid receptor coactivator-3, SRC-3 (also known as AIB1), as a novel
and preferential interactor with cytoplasmic relative to nuclear PELP1. Notably, PELP1 increased activation of
SRC-3 in BC cells, while SRC-3 knockdown blocked PELP1-induced BCSC expansion, suggesting an essential
role for active PELP1/SRC3 complexes in BCSC outgrowth. In follow-up studies, we found that cytoplasmic
PELP1 promotes the phosphorylation of SRC-3 on Thr24 and Ser857. Work of others has implicated SRC-3
pSer857 in breast cancer metastasis as a key substrate of the bifunctional kinase/phosphatase known as
PFKFB4. In related work, we showed that PELP1 forms constitutive transcriptional complexes with both estrogen
(ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors in breast cancer models and patient tumors; a scaffolding action of PR-
B, but not progesterone, was required for ER phosphorylation and regulation of genes by ER/PR/PELP1
complexes, including gene sets important for tamoxifen resistance. Herein, we hypothesize that
ER/PR/PELP1/SRC-3 complexes recruit and amplify key cytoplasmic signaling pathways that mediate
epigenetic events required for chromatin remodeling and reprogramming of steroid receptor (SR)-regulated
transcriptomes required for expansion of therapy resistant BCSC populations. We will test this hypothesis in
breast cancer models and in the following Specific Aims:
• Identify PELP1/SRC-3-activated signaling pathways essential for BCSC expansion and therapy resistance.
• Determine how PELP1/SRC-3 complexes reprogram SR transcriptomes.
• Determine if PELP1/SRC-3/SR cooperation promotes tumorigenesis in vivo.
Current therapies primarily inhibit BC proliferation, but fail to adequately target BCSCs. Understanding the
mechanisms of PELP1/SRC-3/SR signaling and reversible epigenetic regulation of BCSCs will reveal novel
therapies that target the required components of this complex (i.e. other than ER) or downstream signaling
molecules and prevent or reverse this process, thus significantly impacting on the longevity of patients with
metastatic breast cancer."
10929438,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The act of swallowing food and liquid is a basic human function that most people take for granted. Yet,
approximately 15% of older adults suffer from impaired swallowing which can lead to malnutrition, frailty and
pneumonia. Our previous NIH-funded research has confirmed that age-related decline in the muscles of the
pharynx (throat) is associated with negative changes to swallowing mechanics and function, putting older
adults at risk for serious health consequences. Given that exercise and nutrition are known powerful
stimulators of positive muscular change, we propose to investigate these methods to reverse age-related
decline of the pharyngeal swallowing muscles. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that proactive
swallowing exercises (+/- daily protein supplement drinks) will improve the composition, force, and physiology
of the pharyngeal muscles. Our study design begins with 12 weeks of no-treatment control, allowing each of
our 80-community dwelling older adult participants to serve as their own experimental control. Next,
participants will be randomized to complete 12 weeks of pharyngeal exercises (5 days per week) with or
without protein drinks. Before and after each phase, our study team will conduct a comprehensive battery of
outcome measures to quantify changes to the pharyngeal muscles. Specifically, we will capture pharyngeal
muscle composition with magnetic resonance imaging, pharyngeal muscle force with high resolution
manometry, and pharyngeal muscle physiology with videofluoroscopy. We expect that proactive swallowing
exercises will improve the composition, force, and physiology of the pharyngeal muscles and that these gains
will be enhanced in the +protein condition. Finally, we are motivated to identify health-related predictors of
treatment success. To that end, we will assess the influence of baseline measures of nutritional status and
physical function on treatment success by analyzing biochemical markers extracted from blood samples and
by conducting comprehensive analyses of body composition. The global population is rapidly aging and thus
many older adults will experience the debilitating impact of impaired swallowing. Therefore, research
establishing effective interventions to reverse and/or prevent age-related swallowing muscle decline is timely
and important. Building a physiologic reserve in the swallowing muscles can improve the health and quality of
life of community-dwelling older adults."
10842384,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, featured by movement
disorders. PD affects nearly one million Americans and ten million people worldwide. While aging is the major
risk factor, PD can also be caused by genetic mutations. More than ten PD-associated genes have been
identified, and LRRK2 mutations are the most common cause of both familial and sporadic PD cases. LRRK2
gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a large multidomain protein with both kinase and
GTPase activities; most of the LRRK2 disease mutations show increased kinase activity. Therefore, inhibiting
LRRK2 kinase activity holds great potential for treating PD, and numerous pharmaceutical companies are
making tremendous efforts to develop specific inhibitors. Our previous work has revealed the first cryo-EM
structures of full-length human LRRK2, providing the atomic architecture of this 286-kDa kinase in an inactive
conformation. Here we propose to further investigate the working mechanism of LRRK2 by combining cutting-
edge structural biology techniques such as single-particle cryoEM with biochemical, biophysical and cell
biology approaches. We hypothesize that understanding the structural basis of the LRRK2 recruitment,
activation and substrate recognition could provide novel directions for the development of allosteric
inhibitors. In this proposal, the working mechanism of LRRK2 will be dissected at atomic details by
addressing the following fundamental questions. i) How do Rab GTPases recruit LRRK2? ii) What is the
active conformation of LRRK2? and iii) how does LRRK2 specifically recognize its substrates? The
successful outcome of this proposal will provide a molecular picture of the LRRK2 recruitment, activation and
substrate recognition processes in atomic details and, therefore, could serve as the conceptual framework for
designing allosteric LRRK2 inhibitors to treat PD."

12/14 APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center
We submit this application in response to RFA-DK-22-506. UCSF is a current member of the APOLLO
Consortium. This Consortium was established in 2017 to work seamlessly with the Association of Organ
Procurement Organizations (AOPO) to enroll participants in the largest observational study to date of kidney
transplant recipients and donors to evaluate APOL1 gene mutations as a risk factor for graft loss. Our Clinical
Center has been a leader on the West Coast, collaborating with our sites at University of California Los
Angeles, University of California Davis (UC Davis), California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC), Stanford
University, and University of Southern California. In Phase 1 or APOLLO, we have successfully enrolled a total
of 223 participants across these centers, with DNA specimens in hand for 221/223. Our site has overseen the
careful collection of clinical data from the electronic medical record at our own site and those of our engaged
centers to complete the APOLLO Consortium Data forms accurately and completely. In Phase 2, we will
continue to obtain critical follow-up data on all participants and ensure completion of data abstraction from
electronic medical record continues at our engaged sites, to provide patient-level detail not available in
databases maintained by United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and the Scientific Registry of Transplant
Recipients (SRTR). We will ensure a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is measured in all participants, at all
sites, at a longitudinal follow-up time point at least two years after transplantation in APOLLO Phase 1. We will
collect additional biospecimens for contribution to the biorespository as well as unstained biopsy slides as we
have been doing through Phase 1. We will work with the Scientific Data and Coordinating Center to ensure
return of genotype results to all study participants who desire this information. We will also continue to recruit
living donors at our site. Continuation of the APOLLO Consortium will lead to important advances in our
understanding of APOL1 high-risk status and its influence on graft function as well as the biology of APOL1
gene effects."
10735795,"Background: SSIs are common and preventable adverse surgical outcomes that account for substantial
morbidity and mortality. Pre-operative antimicrobial administration reduces SSI; post-operative antimicrobials do
not reduce SSI but do increase other post-operative adverse events. In 2005, the VA implemented the Surgical
Care Improvement Project (SCIP) to increase compliance with peri-operative quality metrics, including
appropriate antimicrobial use. SCIP included a set of publicly reported evidenced-based antimicrobial guideline
compliance metrics targeting high-risk surgeries. The metrics required resource-intense manual review as part
of the VA’s External Peer Review Program (EPRP). In 2015, SCIP achieved sustained compliance with
antimicrobial use metrics exceeding 95% and the program was retired due to the high costs of manual review
with minimal expected additional benefit. This IIR proposal is guided by the Dynamic Sustainability Framework
and examines whether the antimicrobial practice changes achieved by SCIP were sustained and how they
spread to surgeries and practice areas beyond the original scope of the program. This multiple PI submission by
Dr. Hillary Mull, PhD and Dr. Westyn Branch-Elliman, MD, MMSc builds and expands upon their prior VA-funded
collaborative work applying electronic algorithms to measure antimicrobial use and identify adverse outcomes.
 Significance/Impact: Improving antimicrobial prescribing and surgical quality are major VA goals. In FY
2018, within the VA, there were 190,000 surgeries among SCIP-targeted specialties (cardiac, orthopedic,
general/colorectal, gynecology and vascular). Of these, 64% were outpatient, where the PIs found high rates
guideline discordant post-operative antimicrobial use, which contribute to substantial patient harms. Thus, the
potential impact of the research on direct clinical care is high. In addition, there are limited studies examining
what happens to practice change after discontinuation of active programs designed to support compliance with
evidence-based guidelines. The proposed study will close this gap in implementation science research.
 Innovation: In line with the VA’s Learning Health System directive, this project will use the VA’s electronic
health record data to develop algorithms to identify pre-and post-operative antimicrobial use based on the PI’s
prior work. These electronic data mining algorithms capture structured and text note data and represent a
significant technological advancement over costly manual review. This study also answers important questions
about the sustainability of practice change after discontinuation of an active policy with input from frontline staff.
 Specific Aims: 1) Measure sustainability of antimicrobial prophylaxis guideline compliance after SCIP
retirement and assess whether practice changes spread to SCIP-excluded procedures; 2) Assess facilitators
and barriers to implementation sustainability through staff interviews, and map results to implementation
strategies; 3) Develop an implementation playbook with assessment tools, training curricula and other elements
to support scale-up and spread of evidence-based antimicrobial practices in a future HSR&D Hybrid III trial.
 Methodology: Aim I will adapt existing informatics algorithms to extract pre-and post-operative antimicrobial
use from clinical note texts and antimicrobial orders for each of the SCIP surgeries. Previously manually reviewed
2005-2015 EPRP data will be used as the gold-standard for adapting and refining the data mining tools. SCIP
sustainability will be measured by applying the validated antimicrobial compliance algorithms to 2005-2020 data
and performing interrupted time series analyses. SCIP spread within specialties will be assessed with regression
models. Aim II will use qualitative interviews with frontline staff to identify reasons for sustainability of evidence-
based practice using constructs in the Dynamic Sustainability Framework and will triangulate qualitative and
quantitative data to ascertain the long-term impacts of SCIP. Aim III will develop an implementation playbook
with input from our Operational Steering Committee comprised of national and local VA surgical stakeholders.
 Next Steps/Implementation: Test implementation playbook in a Hybrid Type III study to improve practice."

A Fully Patterned Human Neural Tube Model Using Microfluidics
The development of vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) begins with the formation of neural tube (NT)
and its regional patterning to generate neuronal subtypes along the rostral (R)-caudal (C) and dorsal (D)-
ventral (V) axes. Regional patterning of the human NT is a tightly regulated process, deviation from which can
result in neurodevelopmental disorders and may lead to distinct neurological and psychiatric diseases later in
life. Regional patterning of the human NT remains incompletely understood due to limited access to human
embryonic tissues. Animal models have been instrumental in understanding the development of human CNS
and associated disorders. However, they are limited in revealing some fundamental aspects of development,
genetics, pathology, and disease mechanisms that are unique to humans. Stem cell-based in vitro models of
human nervous system development, including neural organoids and bioengineered NT development models,
are emerging as promising experimental tools. However, none of the current stem cell-based neural
development models is capable of recapitulating neural patterning along two orthogonal axes in a 3D tubular
geometry, the hallmark of NT patterning in vivo. Furthermore, the existing neural development models only
recapitulate certain aspects of the development of either human brain or spinal cord regions but not both.
 In our preliminary study, we have successfully leveraged the developmental potential and self-
organizing property of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in conjunction with microfluidics to develop the
first of its kind, synthetic, fully patterned human NT model. Using this microfluidic platform, exogenous
morphogen gradients along two orthogonal axes can be established to achieve regional patterning of the
microfluidic human NT-like structure along both the R-C and D-V axes, in both brain-like and spinal cord-like
regions. This microfluidic patterned human NT-like structure exhibits many hallmarks of NT development,
including a tubular geometry, a single continuous central lumen enclosing by neuronal progenitor cells,
patterned expression of canonical R-C and D-V regional markers including HOX genes, and the emergence of
neural mesodermal progenitors and the isthmic organizer. Thus, the development of the microfluidic human
NT-like structure closely mimics NT development, offering for the first time an in vivo-like tissue architecture
with consistent spatiotemporal cell differentiation and organization.
 The goal of this R01 research is to develop this exciting microfluidic human NT-like model (Aim 1) and
leverage its technical advantages to study the roles of different exogenous morphogen signals in neural
patterning (Aim 2 & 3). Genetic perturbations and lineage tracing assays will be conducted to study human
neural mesodermal progenitor development (Aim 2). In Aim 3 we further aim to achieve D-V patterned human
NT-like structures with either forebrain or spinal cord identities and use these structures to recapitulate
interregional cellular interactions and excitation-to-inhibition interplays during cortical development."
10865027,"ABSTRACT:
 The sense of touch is critical for daily tasks including tactile discrimination, social interaction, and
environmental exploration. The overall objective of this project is to identify the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying the sense of touch in mammals. Previous studies have shown that Merkel discs, a
main type of tactile end organ, play a central role in the sense of touch. Merkel discs are located in touch
sensitive spots throughout the body especially at human fingertips and whisker hair follicles of non-primate
mammals. A Merkel disc consists of a Merkel cell and an Aβ-afferent ending (Merkel ending) to form a
synapse-like structure. We and others have previous shown that the Piezo2 channel on Merkel cells is the
sensor of touch. We have further shown that tactile stimuli activate Piezo2 channels in Merkel cells to result in
Ca2+-action potentials, which leads to Aβ-afferent impulses and behavioral tactile responses. However, the
mechanism by which tactile-induced excitatory signals on Merkel cells are transmitted to Merkel endings
remains elusive and is the focus of this renewal application. Our central hypothesis is that acid sensing ion
channels (ASICs) are the excitatory postsynaptic receptors and proton is the principal transmitter to mediate
excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and synaptic transmission at Merkel discs. We will test this novel
hypothesis with the following specific aims. Aim 1. Characterize the fundamental nature of EPSCs at Merkel
endings of Aβ-afferent fibers. Aim 2. Demonstrate that EPSCs are mediated by ASICs located at Merkel
endings. Aim 3. Elucidate that activation of ASICs by protons is responsible for the generation of EPSCs at
Merkel endings. Aim 4. Identify the isoform of functional ASICs that mediate EPSCs at Merkel endings.
Pressure-patch-clamp recordings will be applied at the heminode of Merkel endings in rodent whisker hair
follicles to record EPSCs that are evoked by mechanical stimulation, and other techniques including synaptic
physiology, pharmacology, immunohistochemistry, and mouse genetics will be used to achieve the above
aims. By completing the above aims, we will have uncovered a new fundamental mechanism mediating
synaptic transmission of tactile signals at Merkel discs. This will significantly advance scientific knowledge
about molecular mechanisms underlying the sense of touch. It may also have important implications in
mechanical sensory dysfunctions (e.g., loss of touch sensation) seen under clinical conditions such as
diabetes and chemotherapy."
10892912,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a devastating and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a
polymorphic CAG repeat in the HTT gene. Although the underlying genetic mutation was discovered over 25
years ago, there is still no cure or effective treatment despite extensive efforts. The CAG repeat mutation
undergoes time- and CAG length-dependent somatic expansion and recent genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) support somatic CAG expansion as the first step of the pathogenic process, required to elicit cellular
toxicity and ultimately clinical disease. GWAS identified several genes involved in DNA repair as modifiers of
age of onset, among which is LIG1, encoding DNA ligase 1. The biological function of DNA ligase 1 implicates
it in somatic CAG expansion, however this gene may also alter processes that impact on cellular toxicity.
Overall, the mechanistic underpinnings of disease modification remain obscure. Independent LIG1 modifier
chromosomes can be distinguished in the human genetic data: one, tagged by a predicted deleterious SNP
encoding a K854N substitution, is onset-delaying, while another is associated with increased LIG1 expression
and is onset-hastening. In this study, we will perform experiments to test hypotheses rooted in human genetic
data to understand the functional consequences of these LIG1 modifier effects. In Aim 1 we will use a knock-in
mouse model of HD to test the impact of the K>N substitution mutation introduced into the mouse Lig1 gene,
and to test the impact of Lig1 upregulation, on somatic CAG expansion and phenotypic expression. In Aim 2
we will use HD patient-derived and isogenic neuronal progenitor cells and neurons harboring LIG1 modifier
alleles to identify their cellular and molecular consequences and to test their impacts on phenotypes elicited by
the HTT mutation. In Aim 3 we will perform biochemical, structural and functional analyses of the LIG1 K845N
variant. Together, these experiments will provide novel insight into mechanisms by which genetic variation in
LIG1 modifies disease in patients, ultimately revealing therapeutic avenues that can be pursued for disease-
modifying treatments."

the US. The expected growth of the elderly population including Veterans is estimated to be paralleled by a
significant increase (50% in the US) in the number of patients diagnosed with HF every year. Although PCI
restores blood flow to the heart and improves myocardial function in patients with HF, the contrast
media used for the procedure can cause CA-AKI, possibly mediated by contrast–induced
vasoconstriction of renal blood vessels and free radical–mediated direct renal tubular toxicity. The
incidence of CA-AKI is estimated to range between 10 and 50% in patients undergoing coronary
angiography and PCI with higher rates in patients with HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF). In the U.S, approximately 1.4 million coronary angiogram procedures are performed each year.
Among the U.S Veterans alone, approximately 30,000 coronary angiograms are performed annually, and
over 1 million contrast-enhanced imaging studies are performed for other various purposes. This estimate
is expected to increase exponentially in the next few decades. With increasing use of contrast media, the
prevalence of CA-AKI is also expected to rise. CA-AKI predicts elevated risk of heart attack, longer hospital
stay, more complicated hospitalization course, and higher in-hospital mortality. Although, periprocedural
administration of isotonic saline intravenous fluid (IVF) has been the standard intervention to prevent CA-
AKI, patients with HF with reduced LVEF may not tolerate IVF. Unfortunately, all the major clinical trials
evaluating prophylactic IVF and other agents excluded patients with HF. Currently, there is no alternative
preventive therapy for CA-AKI in patients with congestive HF with reduced LVEF who cannot
tolerate IVF. This study proposes remote ischemic pre-conditioning (RIPC) elicited by application of one or
more, brief episodes of ischemia and reperfusion of a limb, as a promising alternative therapy for
preventing or attenuating CA-AKI. Given that renal ischemic injury and tubular toxicity are the most
common pathophysiological concepts of CA-AKI, it stands to reason that RIPC may prevent CA-AKI via
nitrite-induced vasodilation and damage associated molecular protein -mediated renal cell protection. In the
preliminary analysis of data of patients with heart attack, an association of RIPC with lower rate of CA-AKI
and in-hospital mortality was observed. In the subgroup with HF with reduced LVEF, RIPC was associated
with lower incidence of CA-AKI, HF symptoms and lower level of plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).
Taken together, these observational data suggest a role for RIPC in renal protection and improvement in
HF symptoms in a population of patients who may not tolerate the standard therapy, isotonic saline IVF.
Therefore, this study is intended to fill a critical void in the prevention of CA-AKI in a population of
Veterans with congestive HF undergoing life-saving coronary angiography and/or PCI. This study
proposes a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to determine the effect of RIPC on CA-AKI (primary outcome),
and to characterize the effect of RIPC on BNP, functional capacity determined by 6-minute walk test
distance, and major adverse kidney events at 90 days (MAKE-90, secondary outcomes) in patients with
congestive HF and LVEF <50% undergoing coronary angiography and/or PCI. This research project will
determine the effect of RIPC on CA-AKI in Veterans with HF with reduced LVEF who cannot tolerate IVF.
The findings from this study will inform the design of a larger multi-center RCT to determine the long-term
effects of RIPC on morbidity/mortality in HF population. It will help develop new therapies for AKI and HF."

10731358,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
One in four women dies from cardiovascular disease (CVD), and living in a postmenopausal estrogen-deficient
state increases susceptibility to metabolic dysfunction and CVD. The candidate’s long-term goal is to develop
an independent research career as a translational endocrinologist focused on the development of novel science-
based strategies for treating or preventing metabolic syndrome and associated comorbidities in menopausal
women. The overall research objective for this Career Development Award (CDA-2) is to identify the effect of a
novel menopause hormone therapy (a combination of conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene (CE/BZA)) on
glucose and lipid homeostasis in obese menopausal women veterans with prediabetes and early diabetes. The
central hypothesis is that treatment with CE/BZA will improve beta-cell function and therefore glucose
homeostasis and promote hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) without promoting hepatic lipid accumulation. The
rationale for the proposed research program is that its successful completion will provide important new insights
regarding the use of CE/BZA to prevent or treat estrogen deficiency-induced metabolic dysfunction in obese
postmenopausal women, while at the same time providing the means to establish the candidate’s early research
independence as a translational scientist. Two specific aims are proposed: 1) Validate that CE/BZA improves
beta cell function, and 2) identify the mechanisms of CE/BZA on hepatic DNL. The physical and intellectual
research environments at Southeast Louisiana Veterans Healthcare System (SLVHCS) are supportive of
professional development in the areas of sex hormones and diabetes. Three training goals are proposed: 1)
Gaining expertise in prospective clinical study design and implementation, 2) obtaining proficiency in commonly
used basic and translational science research techniques for assessment of glucose homeostasis and lipid
metabolism, and 3) expanding the candidate’s professional portfolio, including grant proposal writing, networking,
mentoring and communication skills. The proposed research is significant because in the future, with more
insight into the clinical and molecular mechanisms of CE/BZA, it may be possible to prevent or treat estrogen
deficiency-induced metabolic dysfunction, including obesity, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in postmenopausal women, all of which play a key role in cardiovascular
complications. Findings from the proposed research are expected to position the candidate to submit a
competitive VA Merit application focusing on treating or preventing metabolic syndrome and associated
comorbidities in menopausal women veterans. Ultimately, results of this research continuum are expected to
have an important positive impact on developing innovative therapies to decrease risk for CVD, the leading
cause of death for women worldwide."

Parkinson disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease affecting a large number of U.S. veterans
that causes significant motor symptoms such as slow movement and tremor, as well as non-motor symptoms
such as cognitive decline and dementia. Development of therapies to slow PD progression requires validated
biomarkers of pathologic processes that predict progression. The brain’s inflammatory response is increasingly
recognized as an important source of pathology in PD, and imaging biomarkers of neuroinflammation in PD are
needed. A novel Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique, Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI), is
sensitive to intermingled changes in brain microstructure, and has the capacity to measure the component of
inflammatory cells within a volume of tissue, and distinguish this component from neurodegenerative pathology
or anatomic variation. DBSI MRI has been recently shown to quantify neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis
and Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we will develop and validate this measure in PD. We will determine how the
DBSI measure of neuroinflammation compares to quantitative immunohistochemistry in already-collected
antemortem MRI data with corresponding postmortem fixed brain tissues from people with PD (Aim 1).
Prospectively, in PD and control participants we will compare DBSI measures to the positron emission
tomography (PET) marker of neuroinflammation, PBR28 (Aim 2), and to the activation profile of T cells in blood
and cerebrospinal fluid (Aim 3). We will correlate cross-sectional and longitudinal DBSI measures with clinical
features of motor and cognitive disease progression (Aim 4). In this manner, we will develop a strong
mechanistic understanding of changes in both neuroimaging and T cell biomarkers of inflammation, and how
these relate to motor and cognitive decline in PD. This project holds great promise for identifying and validating
biomarkers of neuroinflammation for prediction of PD progression, patient stratification for trials, and evaluation
of new treatments targeting the immune system in PD. Because DBSI MRI only requires sequences that are
already Food and Drug Administration approved and available on existing clinical MRI scanners, it could be
quickly scaled to clinical applications and clinical trials."

10889976,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a devastating complication of epilepsy and a leading cause
of premature death in persons with chronic uncontrolled epilepsy. Despite the major impact on life expectancy
in these individuals, no targeted SUDEP preventive strategies currently exist. Most SUDEPs occur after a
generalized convulsive seizure, and victims are typically found in bed in the prone position. Until recently, SUDEP
was thought to be due to cardiovascular failure, but research on patients who died while being monitored in
hospital epilepsy units reveal that most SUDEP is due to post-convulsive central apnea. Crucially, a three-minute
post convulsive window of opportunity was identified, beyond which the terminal cascade of respiratory and
cardiac failure appears irrevocable. By advancing our understanding of forebrain breathing networks, we can
develop neuromodulatory strategies for respiratory facilitation and apnea rescue that may prevent SUDEP during
this critical time window. The objective of this project is to understand forebrain modulation of breathing by using
anatomically precise intracranial stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) data that can determine optimal
stimulation paradigms for breathing enhancement. The study population are patients with medically refractory
epilepsy undergoing 1) intracranial SEEG evaluation with implanted depth electrodes for epilepsy surgery, and
2) simultaneous polygraphic cardiorespiratory monitoring of thoracoabdominal excursions, nasal and oral
airflow, oxygen saturation, carbon dioxide, plethysmography and EKG. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1, we will
identify forebrain regions in which electrical activity is coupled with respiratory activity by using spontaneous and
task-related breathing data and monitoring simultaneous brain signal dynamics. We will further analyze functional
connectivity to graph networks as a function of breathing tasks, in order to establish network hubs as candidate
regions for stimulation targets and in order to reveal a comprehensive cortical connectome. In Aim 2, we will
apply electrical stimulus to these regions to assess neuromodulatory effects on respiration. Effective stimulation
paradigms/sites will be tested in the immediate post-convulsive state in the latter part of this study, to prove
feasibility of neuromodulation in this state, and these seizures will be compared with non-stimulated seizures
obtained from the NINDS Center for SUDEP Research, using 1:5 matching (matched for age, sex, SUDEP risk
factors-duration of epilepsy and GCS frequency). Our project will identify effective stimulation sites and
paradigms for breathing rescue as well as will establish feasibility of stimulation approaches in the post-
convulsive state. Our results will set the stage for a clinical trial of efficacy of neuromodulation for apnea rescue
as potential anti-SUDEP therapy, in individuals who at high SUDEP risk. This work will also provide insights into
potential treatment of central apnea associated with other neurological diseases, heart failure, and stroke.

Ischemic coronary heart disease is the world’s leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Within this complex
disease entity, many patients suffer from myocardial ischemia but are found to have no obstructed coronary
arteries (INOCA). These patients have a high risk of cardiovascular events. Yet current methods for accurately
diagnosing and assessing the physiological effects of INOCA are limited. Catheter-based approaches are
invasive, with added risk, procedural time, and cost. Positron-emission tomography (PET) and cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR), both noninvasive techniques for clinically assessing INOCA, have limitations such as
claustrophobia (CMR), cost and radiation dose (PET), and local expertise and availability (both). None of these
noninvasive tests accurately yields both anatomical information on the extent of coronary atherosclerosis and its
pathophysiological consequences. We have developed a noninvasive, low-dose dynamic CT perfusion
technique that can accurately measure myocardial perfusion in mL/min/g. This procedure combines patho-
anatomical assessment using CT calcium and CT angiography, as well as pathophysiologic assessment using
CT-derived stress flow (in mL/min/g) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), which are combined to calculate coronary
flow capacity. The current study seeks to test this novel cardiac CT method for assessing patients with INOCA.
Our technique’s accuracy in measuring stress flow and CFR has been validated in preclinical models, and its
preliminary validation, safety, and feasibility shown in patients. We propose to study prospectively its accuracy
for assessing INOCA. The study aims to (1) test the hypothesis that rest flow, stress flow, and CFR measured
by noninvasive dynamic CT perfusion highly correlate with that by invasive measurement in patients with INOCA;
(2) establish a stress flow and CFR reference range determined by noninvasive dynamic CT perfusion that could
be used to set the minimum normal thresholds for stress flow and CFR; and (3) test the hypothesis that
comprehensive cardiac CT can be used to differentiate between patients with and without physiologically
significant coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with suspected INOCA. Aim 1 will enroll 150 patients with
positive stress test and INOCA. Patients will undergo our comprehensive cardiac CT followed by invasive stress
flow and CFR tests. Aim 2 will enroll 50 patients with negative stress test and measured invasive stress perfusion
greater than 1.21 mL/min/g and CFR > 2.0 to establish the normative range of CT-based stress flow and CFR.
Aim 3 will discriminate between patients with and without physiologically significant CAD with dynamic CT
perfusion, using invasive stress perfusion and CFR as the reference standard. The study’s successful completion
invasive tool that allows comprehensive concurrent evaluation of coronary anatomyand physiology in
symptomatic patients with INOCA."

The state-of-the-art x-ray photon-counting CT (PCCT) generates images in multi-energy bins simultaneously
with high spatial resolution and low radiation dose for tissue characterization and material decomposition. FDA
has approved the techniques in 2021. Both clinical PCCT and micro-PCCT scanners are now commercially
available. This opens a new door to opportunities for functional, cellular, and molecular x-ray imaging with novel
contrast agents such as bismuth and gold nanoparticles. However, x-ray photon-counting detectors are not
perfect, and it remains challenging to reconstruct high-quality PCCT images for various clinical applications.
Over the past several years, deep learning-based tomographic imaging has become a new frontier of image
reconstruction. Different from compressive sensing (CS) methods, which totally rely on the prior information in
terms of an accurate mathematical constraint, the emerging deep learning-based approach is empowered by big
data with which a deep network can be trained for superior tomographic reconstruction. However, a recent study
published in PNAS revealed three types of instabilities of deep tomographic reconstruction networks, which are
believed to be fundamental due to lack of kernel awareness and “nontrivial to overcome”, but CS-based
reconstruction was reported in that study to be stable because of its kernel awareness. Meanwhile, it is hard to
collect large amounts of data with ground-truths for supervised network training up to the clinical image quality.
To overcome the aforementioned challenges in the context of a clinical trial with PCCT using Medipix detectors,
our overall goal is to develop an Unsupervised Deep Learning Approach (UDLA) for few-view and low-dose
image reconstruction based on our Analytic Compressive Iterative Deep (ACID) architecture but specific to PCCT
data, with much higher spatial resolution and computational efficiency, and without the requirement of ground-
truth for training. ACID combines the data-driven power of deep learning, the kernel-awareness of CS, and
iterative refinement to deliver image reconstruction results accurately and stably. To achieve our goal, three
specific aims are defined as follows. Aim 1: UDLA will be designed, developed, optimized, and integrated into
an open-source platform, including a deep end-to-end reconstruction network and an advanced CS module with
a multi-constraint model; Aim 2: UDLA will be tested for stability and generalizability, and accelerated via
software optimization on a high-performance computing platform; and Aim 3: UDLA will be evaluated and
validated in simulation, experiments, and retrospective use of clinical extremity imaging PCCT data.
Upon the completion of this project, the UDLA software should have been characterized for clinical extremity
imaging using Medpix-based PCCT to outperform contemporary iterative algorithms, without the vulnerabilities
of existing deep reconstruction networks and the requirements of ground-truth for network training. In a broader
perspective, our approach represents a paradigm shift towards the integration of model-based and data-driven
reconstruction methods, and may have a lasting impact on PCCT and other tomographic imaging modalities."
10885197,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The tumor suppressor protein p53 is the most frequently mutated protein in human cancers. About 600,000
new cancer patients in the United States are diagnosed each year with tumors expressing mutated p53. Most
of the mutations are missense mutations that affect one of six hotspot sites in the p53 DNA binding domain.
These cancers express full length p53 that has lost tumor suppressor activity, but has acquired gain-of-function
oncomorphic properties that provide selective advantage to cancer cells.
The large number of affected cancers make p53 an exquisite target for cancer therapy. However, therapeutic
approaches require reactivation of mutated p53. Developing “reactivation or corrector drugs” is challenging in
itself, but further complicated by very limited experience in pharma, biotech, and academia in this domain.
These challenges in exploring novel therapeutic approaches by developing p53 corrector drugs have led to
very slow, and limited success in clinical trials with proposed p53 reactivator compounds. It recently emerged
that several of the reported compounds are likely not acting on mutant p53 in vivo, but rather exploit redox-
sensitivity of cells expressing p53 mutants. Development of bona fide p53 mutant corrector drugs that bind p53
and restore a wild-type like conformation/activity in p53 cancer mutants, thus remains a central goal with
potentially very high impact. To achieve this goal mechanistic understanding of the p53 cancer mutant
reactivation process is essential, but currently mostly lacking due to the lack of genuine p53 corrector
molecules with the exception of compounds developed specifically for the relatively rare p53-Y220C allele.
We have extensively studied genetic and pharmacological p53 reactivation. We found that Intragenic rescue
mutations and small molecules we are developing induce a similar conformational change and stabilize an
active conformation of p53 hotspot mutants. Although reactivation mutations have no direct therapeutic
potential, they help in our understanding of p53 mutant reactivation mechanisms and can guide corrector drug
development. Using information obtained from reactivating second-site mutations, we have developed tool
compounds that bind mutant p53 and thereby restore DNA binding activity of mutant p53 in a reconstituted
purified in vitro system. p53 target genes are induced when cells harboring p53 hotspot mutants are exposed
to these compounds. Furthermore, cell proliferation is halted and apoptosis is induced in a p53 mutant
dependent manner. Importantly, growth of tumors carrying p53 mutants is blocked by this compound series in
animal models. Tumors lacking p53 or expressing wild-type p53 are not affected by such treatment. These
compounds provide strong support for feasibility to develop drug-like molecules that act as genuine p53 mutant
correctors. We now propose to use these tool compounds as well as well-characterized rescue mutations to
develop detailed molecular understanding of the reactivation process for p53 hotspot mutants. Findings from
these studies will be essential to jump start the development of chemically diverse p53 corrector drugs."
10903900,"Limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) is a late-onset progressive muscular dystrophy resulting from
mutations in the dysferlin gene. Dysferlin is a membrane-associated protein, highly expressed in skeletal and
cardiac muscle fibers where it orchestrates membrane repair in response to various injuries. Currently, there are
no ongoing clinical trials or therapies to slow disease progression or cure LGMD2B. While useful for in vivo
mechanistic studies, dysferlin-deficient (BLAJ) mice, a model of LGDM2B, exhibit a mild disease phenotype
compared to humans, limiting mouse utility for translational studies. Developing a high-fidelity in vitro model of
human LGMD2B muscle would complement mouse studies and allow patient-specific disease modeling and
drug discovery. Thus, the overarching goal of this project is to engineer a novel 3D human skeletal muscle tissue
model (“myobundle”) that replicates the main structural, functional, and metabolic features of LGMD2B.
Specifically, we will utilize human iPSC lines from three healthy and three LGMD2B donors to engineer LGMD2B
myobundles that exhibit reproducible deficits in muscle contractile function, calcium homeostasis, and lipid
handling, while showing drug responses consistent with studies in BLAJ mice and LGMD2B patients. Importantly,
a defining feature of LGMD2B muscle is the ectopic fat formation suggested to occur due to adipogenic
differentiation of muscle interstitial cells (MICs). We will thus develop a novel tissue-engineered model of
intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) accumulation in LGMD2B muscle by co-culturing MICs isolated from
LGMD2B human muscle biopsies and iPSC-derived muscle progenitor cells. In this novel co-culture system, we
will identify pro-adipogenic factors secreted from LGMD2B muscle and study their ability to induce ectopic fat
formation. Since immune cell infiltration and biased macrophage polarization are additional defining features of
LGMD2B muscle, we will engineer co- and tri-cultured muscle-macrophage myobundles to further characterize
roles of heterocellular interactions and inflammatory milieu in injury response and fat accumulation in LGMD2B.
Finally, our preliminary studies suggest that the cholesterol metabolism in LGMD2B muscle is impaired and
contributes to the disease, which we will further study pharmacologically, biochemically, and histologically in
LGMD2B myobundles and BLAJ mice. Overall, we expect that the novel tissue-engineered model of human
LGMD2B muscle developed in this project will enable new mechanistic and pharmacological studies, eventually
leading to first clinical trials for LGMD2B."

The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is responsible for approximately 200,000 new cancer cases each year worldwide.
Among these, EBV+ Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is an emergent global cancer threat in patients
without overt immunosuppression, irrespective of age, and represents a growing unmet medical need. New
therapeutic approaches are needed to treat EBV+ DLBCL. Only one viral-encoded protein, EBNA1, is
consistently expressed in all known EBV-associated malignancies and is a validated target for inhibition of EBV-
dependent transformation and carcinogenesis.
Investigators at the Wistar Institute have developed VK-2019, a first-in-class EBNA1 inhibitor as a therapeutic
agent, selecting it from over 2500 candidate inhibitor compounds during the hit-to-lead and lead optimization
phases. VK-2019 meets or exceeds industry-accepted criteria for potency, selectivity, metabolic stability, drug
suitability, drug safety, toxicology and bioavailability. We anticipated that VK-2019 would have a favorable safety
profile because there are no human orthologs of EBNA1. Based on preclinical evidence and a first-in-human
Phase I clinical study in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), VK-2019 met all safety,
tolerability and pharmacokinetic endpoints with few documented adverse events (AEs) or Severe Adverse
Events (SAEs). In this early study, we observed stable disease in more than a third and a significant decrease
in EBV plasma levels, a known biomarker of NPC progression, in more than half of the patients, that correlated
with pharmacokinetic exposure. We believe that data from this Phase I study are encouraging in terms of both
on target effect and clinical benefit, and supports a follow-on proof-of-concept study in patients with EBV-positive
DLBCL.
The purpose of this grant is to fund a phase Ib clinical trial of daily oral administration of VK-2019 to (1) further
confirm the safety profile and determine any dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) in advanced EBV+ DLBCL patient
populations; (2) understand the effects of treatment on EBV-specific biomarkers, including EBV and cellular gene
expression and (3) study the effects of treatment on the tumor microenvironment and immune response.
The clinical trial infrastructure necessary for the conduct of this study is already in place at the Sidney Kimmel
Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University. This clinical trial will provide critical information on the safety,
tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of VK-2019 in a EBV+ DLBCL patient population. This application brings
together basic and translational investigators to understand whether EBNA1 inhibitors can be a therapeutic
option for latent EBV infection and cancer and examines the mechanism of action."

Hypertension is the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factor and disproportionately responsible for adverse
outcomes in African Americans. African Americans with hypertension are also more likely to be unaware of
elevated blood pressures, which further exacerbates complications of cardiovascular disease. Thus, detection
of accurate blood pressure in African Americans is a critical step towards alleviating hypertension disparate
outcomes. The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive cuffless blood pressure monitor for
measurement and identification for masked hypertension in communities of color. Current state of the
technology that incorporates cuffs is cumbersome and does not allow for passive/frequent measurements. The
trends for cuffless solutions are primarily focused on photoplethysmography (PPG) which does not operate
well on darker skin tones and on participants with higher BMIs. This project leverages bioimpedance as a
sensing modality in the form of a finger-worn device, like smart rings. Our device provides robust and nearly
continuous bioimpedance readings, corresponding to blood volume and hemodynamic changes, that will be
translated to blood pressure using machine learning and AI algorithms. Bioimpedance does not have the
limitations of PPG; it is insensitive to varying skin tones and has deep penetration capabilities and therefore a
higher BMI (and a thicker layer of fat under the skin) does not impact the measurements. The principal focus of
our investigation is to gain insights into masked hypertension with the objective of capturing blood pressure
frequently during the day and at nighttime. Our proposed technology can help identify certain short-term
dynamics inclusive of variations of blood pressure and allows effective monitoring of response to medication
for African American in Atlanta, GA and African American and Latinx communities in College Station, TX. This
project incorporates two aims. Aim 1 intends to validate the smart ring technology that has been developed
at Texas A&M on African American and Latinx participants (N=60) with varying BMI in lab settings, with no
known pre-existing condition beyond obesity, in presence of various blood pressure maneuvers (cold pressor,
handgrip and exercise) and for three postures (supine, standing and sitting). Aim 2 expands the validation of
our technology in African American patients (N=144) with and without a history of hypertension in
Atlanta, GA in mixed lab and ambulatory settings with a unique focus to explore the reported phenomenon
of masked hypertension and to advance technology acceptance and social relevance in communities of color.
After nearly ten years of industrial and academic technology development to extract blood pressure indices
using PPG, to our knowledge, this effort for the first time addresses the limited effectiveness of PPG on darker
skin tones and those who have a higher BMI. The literature demonstrates the higher prevalence of
hypertension in African American communities and among those who have obesity, which further calls for BMI
independent technology development and validation."

Cannabis is widely used worldwide and is associated with negative outcomes including cannabis use disorder

“medical” cannabis globally, the increasing availability of cannabis, the higher potency of cannabis, the
availability of highly potent cannabinoid products, the commercialization of cannabis, and the rising rates of
cannabis use, it is critical to understand how genetic factors influence 1) an individual's vulnerability for
addiction and psychosis, 2) the response to cannabinoids, 3) the response to novel treatments for CanUD.CUD

outcomes including schizophrenia (SCZ). SCZ is highly heritable and population-based and genetics studies
both support a bidirectional genetic relationship between SCZ and CanUD. However, the precise contribution of
genetic factors in the development of psychosis outcomes related to cannabis are not clear.
 We propose a translational research program bringing together two highly productive and complementary
research groups (genetics [Gelernter] and cannabinoid pharmacology [D'Souza]). 1) We will conduct a
genomewide association analyses and meta-analyses of CanUD to compute PRS for CanUD (CanUD-PRS)
based on best- and largest-available datasets. that includes existing and new data releases of MVP, AllofUs;
FinnGen and other relevant data that becomes available over the course of the project. We will study genetic
overlap and causality of CanUD with other complex traits in EA, AA, and other ancestry groups. 2) We will also
determine the extent to which CanUD-PRS and SCZ-PRS influence the acute effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis in a Human Lab Study (HLS). Lastlywe will explore the
extent to which 3a) CanUD-PRS predicts response to FAAH-Inhibitor
treatment
and also severity of CanUD
pretreatment in a completed NIDA funded trial, and 3b) CanUD-PRS and SCZ-PRS, respectively influence the
efficacy and safety of cannabis derivatives in a prospective large VA-funded multicenter trial with cannabinoids.
 Successful completion of this study is expected to 1) identify many more genetic risk loci for CUD, 2) in
European and non-European populations, 3) with post-GWAS statistical analysis to understand the biologyof
CUD, 4)translation via human experimental studies to increase our understanding of the response to THC
infusion, and its implications for the development of cannabis use disorder and psychosis, and 5) the genetic
influence on response to novel treatments for cannabis use disorder and cannabinoid treatments for
neuropathic pain."

 Epithelial cells carry out secretory and absorptive functions that require the polarized distribution of
transporters, receptors and adhesion molecules at the apical and basolateral plasma membranes. Acquisition
and maintenance of apical-basolateral polarity involves sorting of plasma membrane proteins along the
biosynthetic and recycling pathways. The question of how apical and basolateral proteins in transit to the plasma
membrane are sorted in endosomal compartments has been at the center of research effort for decades. An
important mechanism of protein sorting is mediated by the clathrin adaptor protein AP-1B, which is a feature of
epithelial cells. AP-1B recognizes cargo at discrete sorting motifs and it was initially identified as mediator of
basolateral sorting. However, recent research by the applicant and others has determined that AP-1B also
mediates apical sorting. Moreover, some epithelia like the kidney proximal tubule and the retinal pigment
epithelium constitutively lack AP-1B. Therefore, additional mediators of polarized sorting must exist in these
epithelia. This fact, and our fluid understanding of AP-1B-mediated trafficking warrants revisions of the traditional
models of polarized protein sorting in epithelial cells. Filling these gaps in knowledge will reveal mechanisms
that can be exploited to understand and treat pathologies where epithelial physiology is compromised. The
applicant’s research program aims to characterize mechanisms of polarity in AP-1B-deficient epithelia and their
role in tissue organization, homeostasis and disease. The focus of the current R35 application will be on epithelial
cells of the kidney proximal tubule and retinal pigment epithelium, which lack AP-1B. We will study the roles of
an endosomal sorting protein previously characterized in non-polarized cells, sorting nexin-27 (SNX27) and
vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs) in polarized trafficking. We will also employ proteomics and
high throughput approaches to identify additional molecular mediators of polarized trafficking. We will test
whether the identified mechanisms mediate apical delivery of Megalin, a physiologically relevant surface receptor
expressed in kidney proximal tubule and retinal pigment epithelium. The R35 funding mechanism is an excellent
fit for achieving these goals, since it is intended to support the pursue of ambitious and flexible ideas with the
intent of developing the applicant’s research and training program, rather than an individual project. At the same
time, completing this proposal will lay out foundations for future advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention
of diseases, therefore directly contributing to the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences."
10892268,"Chronic psychological stressors, including work-related stress, poor socioeconomic status and social isolation —
all heightened by recent Covid-19 lockdowns — are major risk factors for hypertension and cardiovascular
disease. Stress-activated regulatory mechanisms that stimulate the sympathetic nervous system to elevate blood
pressure and redistribute blood flow to vital organs have evolved as life-protecting measures. From an
evolutionary perspective, enhancing cardiovascular responses through long-term sensitization of these
mechanisms is advantageous to organisms subjected to repeated stressors. However, in modern society, where
coping with stressful situations rarely requires marked elevations in blood pressure, these actions become
detrimental, as repeated unnecessary overload of the cardiovascular system exerts irreversible cardiac, vascular,
and renal damage. Accordingly, augmented cardiovascular sensitivity to stressors in young, normotensive
individuals is strongly correlated with the risk of becoming hypertensive later in life. Our long-term goal is to
investigate the central mechanisms that determine the magnitude of blood pressure elevations elicited by stress
in order to identify novel anti-hypertensive therapeutic targets. Here, we propose to investigate a novel signaling
cascade mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in
the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), a brain region that plays a key role in orchestrating
neuroendocrine and cardiovascular stress responses. BDNF expression is upregulated in the PVN during stress
in response to increased excitatory input and neuronal activity. We have previously shown that BDNF elicits
important adaptive changes within the PVN to elevate sympathetic activity and blood pressure. Our preliminary
data suggest that BDNF stimulates mTOR, as part of mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) in PVN neurons, and mTORC1
can fundamentally change neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity, resulting in elevated neuronal
excitability to augment cardiovascular stress responses and promote hypertension. To test our hypothesis, we
employ a comprehensive array of in vitro patch-clamp studies, neuronal morphology analysis, as well as in vivo
experiments using viral vector-mediated genetic manipulation of BDNF and mTORC1 and telemetric monitoring
of cardiovascular parameters in rats. In Aim 1, we test whether mTORC1 activation in the PVN elevates blood
pressure, augments cardiovascular stress responses, and mediates hypertensive actions of BDNF. In Aim 2, we
determine whether BDNF–mTORC1 signaling regulates structural and functional characteristics of PVN pre-
sympathetic neurons, resulting in enhanced excitability. In Aim 3, we test whether inhibition of BDNF–mTORC1
prevents chronic stress-induced hypertension in borderline hypertensive rats. These studies have the potential
to significantly advance the field by establishing the BDNF–mTORC1 axis as a highly important regulator of
autonomic and cardiovascular function that determines the amplitude of blood pressure elevations during stress
and elicits long-term adaptive mechanisms in the PVN that promote the development of hypertension."

 In skin epithelium, a population of progenitor cells distinctly capable of proliferation, self-renewal, and terminal
differentiation into post-mitotic progeny, is responsible to sustain tissue homeostasis throughout life. In particular,
the dynamic choice between renewal and differentiation has emerged as a critical regulator of the long-term fate
of epidermal progenitors with cancer-driver oncogenic mutations, which are either rapidly eliminated through
increased differentiation or tolerated as growth suppressed clones due to a stringent renewal/differentiation
equilibrium.
 Our long-term objective is to establish how epidermal progenitor cells balance growth in the presence of
oncogenic mutations to maintain tissue homeostasis. To do so, we will employ: (i) a mouse model that can initiate
expression of oncogenic Hras in a single epidermal progenitor, (ii) intravital imaging to document growth from a
single oncogenic cell to a stably integrated clone, (iii) a novel progenitor renewal assay to quantify dynamic cell
fate choices accompanying clone expansion, and (iv) our recently developed methods to modify gene function
in epidermal and stromal cells surrounding the oncogenic clone, to explore specific cellular and molecular
mechanisms we hypothesize function are the interface of oncogenic cells and their microenvironment, and
ensure skin homeostasis.
 This application aims to test the hypotheses that: 1.) Balanced progenitor renewal, critical to epidermal
tolerance of oncogenic mutations, is coordinated across the tissue through short- and long-range non-cell
autonomous interactions; 2.) Signaling between oncogenic clones and the surrounding normal epidermis,
mediated by traditional axon guidance molecules, is required for balanced progenitor renewal and skin
homeostasis; and 3.) Skin site-specific interaction between epidermal and stromal compartments can override
oncogenic tolerance and lead to loss of tissue homeostasis.
 The results of our research are expected to immediately integrate our growing understanding of cell
autonomous mechanisms of oncogenic tolerance into the broader, tissue-wide context critical to skin
homeostasis. We expect these findings to inform future development of comprehensive strategies, focused on
both the progenitor cell and its microenvironment, to manipulate its renewal potential and treat conditions marked
by unrestrained epidermal growth."

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a highly fatal condition characterized by diffuse pulmonary
infiltrates and severe hypoxemia. The outcomes of ARDS are significantly worse in older adults, a finding that
has been underscored by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. ARDS is known to be more severe with advanced
biological age, as demonstrated by the relationship between telomere length and severity of ARDS. Aging is
characterized by inflammation and cellular senescence, two processes which may mechanistically explain worse
outcomes seen in older adults with ARDS. Recently, two inflammatory subphenotypes have been described in
ARDS. The hyperinflammatory subphenotype has a higher mortality, similar to that of older adults. A
considerable overlap exists in the protein biomarkers which define the hyperinflammatory subphenotype and
those which circumscribe the age defining process of senescence, suggesting that age may play a role in the
biological heterogeneity of ARDS. Furthermore, inflammation and cellular senescence are both canonical age-
related processes. The proposed research will test the relationships between aging, inflammation, and outcomes
in ARDS and determine whether biological age differs between the two previously defined inflammatory
subphenotypes of ARDS. Finally, this work will attempt to define novel senescent subphenotypes of ARDS and
establish the degree to which these subphenotypes overlap with the already defined inflammatory
subphenotypes. This work will be performed in two distinct cohorts, a COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohort
allowing for additional analysis regarding whether the relationship between age, inflammation, and outcomes is
differentially expressed in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 ARDS. This work will contribute significantly to a
deeper mechanistic understanding of ARDS and will support predictive enrichment in ARDS clinical trials which
will contribute to more effective therapies for older adults with ARDS."
10898730,"Modest response rates to first-line antidepressant treatment for late-life depression (LLD) expose individuals to
prolonged depressive symptoms that worsen their prognosis and associated health risks. Biomarkers of
treatment response can alleviate this burden by identifying individuals most likely to benefit from
antidepressant treatment. MRI measures of brain structure and function are a promising tool to identify such
biomarkers, though the performance required for clinical translation has remained elusive. The goal of this
proposal is to integrate complementary network measures from structural and functional MRI with
clinical measures to generate biologically relevant features that can improve prediction of treatment
outcome in LLD. The anticipated impact of this research will provide improved personalization of LLD
treatment (NIMH Strategic Objective 3.2), while elucidating the neural circuitry indicative of treatment outcome
(Objective 1.3). To achieve this goal, structural, resting state, and diffusion-weighted MRI will be collected from
75 participants with LLD before commencing an algorithmic antidepressant treatment protocol. The role of
resting state functional connectivity as a mediator of the relationship between structural connectivity and
clinical measures (baseline depression severity and change in depression severity over treatment) will be
investigated within key neural circuitry at the group level. Individual Multimodal Pathway Statistics (IMPathS)
will be derived to quantify the personalized importance of functional connectivity to the relationship between
structural connectivity and depression severity for prediction of treatment outcome at the individual level. Utility
of IMPathS will be assessed by their ability to improve performance beyond unimodal MRI and clinical
predictors. Dr. Gerlach has a PhD in nuclear engineering and radiological sciences and is completing a
transition from computational physics to computational neuroscience. He will require additional training in 1)
the neurobiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of LLD, 2) diffusion-weighted imaging processing and
analysis, 3) advanced statistical training for development and testing of IMPathS, 4) human subjects, study
design, and data collection. Completion of the training and research plan in this career development award will
enable Dr. Gerlach to progress to an independent investigator focused on investigating the neurobiology of late
life anxiety and mood disorders through improved integration of multimodal neuroimaging measures. Dr.
Gerlach will execute this training and research with the full support of the Department of Psychiatry at the
University of Pittsburgh, which is a highly collaborative environment focused on the development of early
career scientists."

 Neural activity in the neocortex is plastic over a range of temporal scales. Learning associations between
sensory stimuli and behaviorally relevant outcomes drives cortical plasticity and is fundamental to an organism’s
survival. Chronic stress can also impact neural circuits although its contributions to sensory cortex connectivity
and sensory encoding is unclear. Changes in information processing in the neocortex can take place at different
spatial scales: in local microcircuits made up of heterogeneous excitatory and inhibitory cell types and in larger
interconnected cortical networks. Rodent studies from the last decade have revealed an elaborate network of
secondary visual areas that may be involved in visually-guided behaviors such as associating initially neutral
visual stimuli with aversive events. However, the dynamic network connectivity of these secondary areas and
their distinct contributions to learned, visually guided fear behavior is unknown. Fear-learning enhances the
cortical representation of stimuli that predict a foot shock, but it is currently unknown if different inhibitory
elements support these changes in visual stimulus representations.
 Using innovative imaging approaches this proposal will address 3 Aims: (1) Determine the changes in
network dynamics and functional connectivity that accompany fear learning. The proposed experiments will
investigate primary and secondary visual cortical contributions to learned fear behavior using simultaneous dual
2-photon/widefield imaging and cortical inactivation approaches. (2) Determine the microcircuits that contribute
to fear-learning related changes in cortical responses. Using cell-type specific 2-photon imaging and
optogenetics Dr. Moberly will test the hypothesis that VIP-mediated disinhibition enhances cortical output neuron
responses. (3) Investigate the consequences of stress for functional sensory cortical network architecture and
its relationship to ongoing behavioral state.
 Dr. Moberly will conduct this research in the labs of his mentors Drs. Jessica Cardin and Michael Higley
at the Yale University School of Medicine with input from advisory committee members, Drs. Marina Picciotto
and Michael Crair. In the K99 period, Dr. Moberly will learn new technical skills in cellular 2-photon and
simultaneous dual 2-photon/widefield imaging in combination with optogenetics and quantitative behavioral
approaches. The proposed experiments and multifaceted training plan will impart Dr. Moberly with a unique
combination of skills that will position him to transition into a successful independent career as a systems
neuroscientist."
10912785,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An estimated eleven million individuals are released from U.S. jails and prisons each year. Individuals with a
history of incarceration have higher rates of cardiovascular events and mortality compared to the general
population, especially in the weeks following release. An especially underexplored factor in the epidemiology of
cardiovascular disease in this population is sleep health. Incarcerated people may have unique reasons for
being sleep deficient at the individual, environmental, and institutional policy levels. They have higher rates of
mood disorders and chronic pain, which amplify sleep deficiency. Exposure to extreme temperatures, noise,
and light within correctional facilities and halfway houses may impact sleep. Exposure to violence and the
conditions of confinement are associated with increased rates of psychosocial stress or post-traumatic stress
disorder, contributing to sleep-disrupting nightmares and insomnia. The overarching aim of this study is to
understand how incarceration, especially correctional and post-release social and physical environments,
contribute to sleep deficiency and cardiovascular disease risk. The central hypothesis of this study is that sleep
deficiency is associated with the factors in the social and physical environment during incarceration and after
release. I propose a mixed methods study with the following aims: 1) Identify population-specific risk factors in
the social and physical environment that contribute to sleep deficiency during and after incarceration and
potential opportunities to improve sleep health; 2) Characterize using geospatial analysis the environmental
factors during incarceration and post-release that may contribute to sleep deficiencies; 3) Develop and pilot
instruments to assess sleep deficiency and sleep environment among people with a history of incarceration. To
achieve these aims, I will leverage the existing infrastructure of an ongoing NHLBI R01 study (JUSTICE,
1R01HL137696-01A1) and the expertise of the SEICHE Center for Health and Justice, the Yale Program in
Sleep Medicine, the Sleep and Health Research Program and Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at the
University of Arizona, and the National
Environmental
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Social and
Determinants of Health Group.The proposed research and training in sleep medicine and
cardiometabolic outcomes, environmental factors in sleep health, and intervention development will facilitate
my transition to a career as an independent researcher in sleep health disparities among people with a history
of incarceration and position my research to impact public health interventions and policies."

Mucor circinelloides is a Mucoralean mold and a primary causative pathogen of mucormycosis, a severe and
life-threatening infection among immunocompromised patient populations. Unfortunately, M. circinelloides
possesses a high degree of intrinsic resistance to antifungals, leaving clinicians with few options when treating
patients with mucormycosis. A critical barrier to the development of strategies to overcome M. circinelloides
infections is a current lack of available genetic tools and a consequent lack of understanding of the genetic and
molecular basis of its ability to resist antifungals. Our long-term goal is to advance the treatment of invasive
fungal infections by developing new therapeutic strategies to overcome difficult-to-treat fungal pathogens. The
overall objective of this proposal is to develop a recyclable and Mucor circinelloides-optimized Cas9 gene-drive
system capable of multi-target gene-editing, and to implement the M-Drive system to identify and characterize
the specific M. circinelloides efflux pump-encoding genes which impact M. circinelloides antifungal susceptibility
and represent novel genetic and molecular weak-points which can be therapeutically exploited for the
development of future antifungal therapies. To achieve this, we will test our central hypothesis that 1) that the
multinucleate nature of M. circinelloides cells can be exploited to implement an efficient and recyclable Cas9-
mediated gene-drive system, 2) disruption of specific M. circinelloides efflux pump genes which are responsive
to posaconazole treatment will have an impact on M. circinelloides antifungal susceptibility, and 3) leveraging
the M-Drive system will allow for the rapid identification and characterization of these M. circinelloides efflux
pump-encoding genes which influence antifungal susceptibility. In Aim 1, we will utilize our M. circinelloides
pyrG- marker system to construct the M-Drive compatible (Cas9+) strain and confirm the functionality and
efficiency of the M-Drive system by disrupting the previously characterized carRP and cnbR genes
simultaneously. In Aim 2, we will implement the M-Drive system to disrupt a prioritized set of efflux pump-
encoding genes which are transcriptionally up-regulated in response to posaconazole treatment and determine
their impact on susceptibility to posaconazole as well as other antifungal agents. Our approach is innovative
and contains important technical and conceptual advances that are expected to contribute significantly to the
study of mucormycosis and to have a positive impact on the understanding of the genetic liabilities of M.
circinelloides. The proposed research is significant in that upon completion, we will have created Mucor-
optimized genetic tools will make possible, for the first time, rapid and efficient gene-editing in this model
Mucoralean pathogen. These studies will then accelerate the comprehensive characterization of M. circinelloides
genes and gene families which are required for M. circinelloides to resist antifungal agents and establish a
foundation for the development of therapeutic strategies to overcome mucormycosis."

Chagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc), represents the highest parasitic disease burden in
Western hemisphere. Chagas patients experience high incidences of thromboembolic events and stroke that
result in ~7000 deaths every year. The economic burden of CD is estimated at ~$10 billion due to healthcare
costs and lost productivity by premature deaths, and it provides a strong rationale for investment in the
development of new therapies for CD. Studies in humans and our preliminary data in experimental models
show that coagulation factors (CFs) expression and activation were increased during early phases of CD,
before the clinically symptomatic cardiac disease and ischemic stroke incidences become clinically apparent.
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) regulates CFs gene expression, and we found that Tc-induced DAMPs
signal a hepatic increase in HNF4 (1 adult and 3 fetal isoforms) expression and transcriptional activity in
CD. Publicly available ChIP-seq datasets and our preliminary results suggest that HNF4 may influence the
assembly of the nucleoproteins complex and DNA-histones epigenetic signature to regulate CFs gene
expression. Thus, in this project, we will test the hypothesis that Tc and Tc-induced DAMPs dysregulate
coagulation hemostasis at the gene expression and activation levels, and normalizing the HNF41/3 levels
will stabilize the procoagulants - anticoagulants dynamics and limit the prothrombotic and pathogenic events in
CD. Using our mouse model of infection and primary and cultured hepatocytes with cutting-edge molecular
tools, we will test our hypothesis in two aims. In aim 1, we will evaluate the longitudinal changes in CFs
expression, activation, and thrombogenesis during CD development; and examine if treatment during the
indeterminate-to-chronic phase with anti-parasite drug or molecular decoys to normalize HNF41/3 levels
would prevent hypercoagulability and vascular thrombi in brain and heart of chagasic mice, thereby controlling
CD pathogenesis. In aim 2, we will obtain a molecular view of the changes in the expression, distribution, and
activity of HNF4 isoforms and core DNA nucleoproteins during CD and examine how HNF4 interactions with
nucleoproteins and histone epigenetic marks on target gene promoters influence the hepatic expression of CFs
in CD. We believe these studies will provide novel insights into how HNF4 defects contribute to hemophilia
and may lead to novel therapeutic strategies (eg, antisense oligonucleotides to correct HNF4 isoforms) to
control Chagas and other cardiac and neurological disorders in which thrombophilia is a key etiologic factor."

The extreme emotional strain of parenting an infant in the fast-paced medicalized Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
(NICU) setting can be detrimental to mental health and functioning with up to 70% of parents experiencing
clinically significant levels of depression, anxiety and trauma symptoms. Poor parental mental health contributes
to maladaptive coping and can impair parental functioning, parent-infant attachment, and long-term infant
development. Therefore, early identification of and support for parents at-risk for clinical distress is of paramount
importance. Clinical and research experts have recommended universal screening and ongoing mental health
assessment for all NICU parents to identify specific needs and offer appropriate levels of support. Unfortunately,
widespread implementation of a clinically practical approach has not been achieved. Barriers to screening
include competing demands on parents’ time and focus during daytime hours, such as participating in infant
care, pumping/breastfeeding, meeting with health care providers (HCPs), and making complex decisions about
life-threatening medical procedures, as well as job demands and caretaking for their other children. Obstacles
such as staff availability (e.g., to screen and treat during evenings and weekends) and staff burden limit service
implementation to parents given the focus on medically complex infants receiving intensive care. Mobile health
(mHealth) interventions offer an innovative approach to tackle these barriers. The overarching goal of the current
proposal is to develop and test a novel mHealth app entitled, EmBRACE (Empower NICU – A Bridge to
Resources for Adjusting and Coping with Emotions) to establish: 1. Universal mental health screening while
giving NICU parents control over when and where assessments are completed; 2. Ongoing mental health
monitoring using a set of quick daily assessments (via ecological momentary assessment) and weekly
screenings; 3. Provision of customized microlearning education (e.g., 1-3 minute videos) tailored to assessment
results and referrals in a stepped-care approach; and 4. Use of a sustainable contingency management
approach to increase parent compliance with assessments, microlearning, and referral follow-up. In the R21
phase, we aim to 1) conduct formative research with NICU parents and HCPs that leverages a user-centered
design and the PRECEDE-PROCEED theoretical model to develop the EmBRACE prototype; and 2) evaluate
the feasibility (usability, acceptability, and clinical applicability) of EmBRACE with 20 current NICU parents. In
the R33 phase, we aim to 1) revise the EmBRACE platform; and 2) conduct a multisite, pilot randomized
controlled trial in NICUs located across the U.S. with 120 current NICU parents to test EmBRACE’s efficacy
relative to an active comparator group. EmBRACE has the potential to reduce the significant gaps in mental
health care for NICU parents by providing universal screening, ongoing monitoring, and linkage to tailored
psychoeducation and referrals, thereby assisting overburdened NICU HCPs, and ultimately promoting best
practices to optimize parent and infant outcomes."
10892861,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The objective of this proposal is to identify new approaches for targeting clonal hematopoiesis (CH). CH is
characterized by selective expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) clones harboring
mutations in genes such as TET2 and DNMT3A. These HSPC in turn produce pathogenic mutant myeloid cells
that can contribute to several aging-related co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause
mortality. An expanded mutant HSPC pool may also contribute to increased risk of hematological malignancies.
CH prevalence is significantly elevated in the elderly and individuals with prior genotoxic exposures, smoking
history, and/or chronic inflammatory disease. These conditions are associated with chronically perturbed
physiological homeostasis, characterized by hyper-inflammation. Understanding the mechanism(s) promoting
the selective expansion of mutant HSPC is crucial for prioritizing therapeutic targets that can suppress CH.
A central premise of our application is that that CH arises from a targetable interplay between inflammatory
signals and altered metabolic programming that supports the energetic needs and thereby the preferential
expansion of CH HSPC. Using the mouse as a model representing key features of human CH, our preliminary
data show that CH HSPC exhibit increased levels of the transcription factor Hif-1 aberrant glycolytic
metabolism and increased ATP production relative to wild-type HSPC. We find that inflammatory cytokines,
particularly IL-1 strongly potentiates CH HSPC expansion, glycolytic metabolism and Hif-1 activity. Strikingly,
treatment of CH mice with OLT-1177, an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor that prevents cleavage and activation
of IL-1 potently suppresses CH. We hypothesize that CH is the result of an interdependent mechanism in which
NLRP3-mediated IL-1 production potentiates Hif-1 and downstream glycolytic activity to support CH HSPC
expansion. We propose that NLRP3 inhibition disrupts this circuit, limiting expansion of CH HSPC.
To address the mechanism, we propose two Specific Aims: 1) we will characterize the metabolic features of
Tet2/, Tet2+/ and Dnmt3aR878H/+ CH HSPC using in vivo mass spectrometry- and flow cytometry-based
analyses of metabolism and glucose flux. We will also identify the extent to which CH HSPC rely upon Hif-1
and glycolysis for their energetic needs; 2) we will evaluate the requirement for NLRP3 in promoting aberrant
glycolytic activity and/or preferential expansion of CH HSPC. We will use molecular genetics approaches to
assess the role and mechanism of Hif-1 and NLRP3 in regulating CH HSPC metabolism and promoting their
expansion in vivo. Using our non-conditioned adoptive BM transfer mouse model of CH, we will validate our
mechanism using pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 with OLT-1177 and establish whether NLRP3 blockade
suppresses HSPC expansion, aberrant metabolic activity and accumulation of inflammatory immune cells in the
heart and other tissues. This work has the potential to re-frame CH as a therapeutically targetable metabolic
phenotype, significantly improving health among groups with high prevalence of CH such as the elderly."

One in six children aged 6-17 years had a behavioral health (BH) diagnosis in 2016, with estimates climbing to
more than one in four during the COVID-19 pandemic. Limited access to BH services has long presented
challenges for most children. Efforts to address the shortcomings of the specialty BH care system, such as
integrating BH care into pediatric primary care settings, and state programs that offer telephonic psychiatry
consultation to pediatricians, have helped improve care, but immense gaps in care and disparities persist.
Accountable care organizations (ACOs) incentivize care integration and population health, which promotes
community-health care linkages, care coordination, and interventions to address social determinants of health.
The innovative reform introduced by ACOs has the potential to improve BH care delivery, but their impact for
pediatric populations is largely unknown. Studies of adult populations suggest that ACOs with certain
organizational features (e.g., type of contract) may improve quality of care for chronic diseases but the few
studies of the impact of ACOs on quality of care and outcomes for children have not focused on this large,
high-risk population of children with BH disorders. This study will be the first to address this critical gap in
knowledge by taking advantage of the natural experiment taking place in Massachusetts (MA), a state with a
high prevalence of children with BH diagnoses. In 2018, MA, launched 17 new Medicaid ACOs with
heterogeneous organizational features (e.g., size; physician vs. hospital-led; age mix. We will leverage MA’s
innovative Medicaid ACO ‘experiment’ to address the following aims using mixed methods: 1) Evaluate the
impact of ACOs on BH care quality, outcomes, and disparities for Medicaid-insured children; 2) Discern how
ACO heterogeneity modifies ACOs’ effects on BH quality and outcomes; 3) Determine the relationship
between parent reported experience with their child’s Behavioral Health care and organizational features of the
Medicaid ACOs. Fundamental changes in healthcare are needed to address socioeconomic and racial/ethnic
disparities in BH care quality and outcomes for children in vulnerable populations. Our innovative mixed
methods approach to examining the association between exposure to a new heterogeneous group of Medicaid
ACOs and BH care and outcomes uses state-level administrative claims and survey data and key informant
interviews with ACO leaders and parents to begin to address this large gap in knowledge. This new information
is expected to benefit providers, payers, and policy makers responsible for the care of vulnerable populations
of children with BH disorders."
10766277,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Progeroid syndromes mimic aging at an accelerated rate and are key to understanding both premature
and normal aging. One class of progeroid syndromes results from defective DNA repair pathways. For example,
Werner syndrome (WS)—a rare inherited disease characterized by premature aging and cancer—is caused by
mutations in the DNA repair helicase WRN. WS patients closely recapitulate many normal aging phenotypes,
making WS a model system for aging. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in WS
pathologies remain poorly understood. Here, I propose to answer critical questions regarding the functions of
WRN via an interdisciplinary approach that includes structural biology, single-molecule biochemistry, and cell
biology.
 My career goal is to establish an independent research program dedicated to understanding the
molecular and cellular mechanisms of genomic instability associated with aging and aging-related diseases. As
a first step to achieving this goal, I have pursued postdoctoral training in single-molecule microscopy and
biochemistry, complementing my background in structural biology and biophysical techniques. The mentoring
phase of the K99/R00 award will provide me with additional training in cryo-electron microscopy, cell biology,
telomere biology, and the biology of human aging through an expert group of mentors and advisors. Here I
propose to: (1) Determine the molecular architecture of full-length WRN (2) Identify how the nuclease and
helicase activities of WRN are regulated (3) Determine how WRN cooperates with telomeric proteins to unwind
G-quadruplexes during telomere replication to prevent telomere loss, and (4) determine how WRN-deficiency
leads to inflammation and premature cellular senescence. Completion of these aims will represent a major step
forward in our understanding of WRN’s role in preventing genomic instability and will lay the groundwork for my
long-term goals to determine the mechanisms of genome maintenance by other DNA repair enzymes and their
importance in human aging and age-related pathologies.
 A K99/R00 award will allow me to establish an independent research program that will make me a strong
candidate for a tenure-track position at a leading U.S. research institution. My work will provide important insights
into how WRN and its interaction partners maintain our genomes and help us understand the biological
consequences of WRN dysregulation. Furthermore, these studies will provide a more detailed understanding of
how WRN-deficiency leads to accelerated aging phenotypes found in WS."

Dr. Haghighi's research specialty is in medical epigenetics with applications to traumatic brain Injury (TBI),
depression, and suicidal behavior. These epigenetic studies involve how genes are differentially transcribed
and regulated, within human clinical and postmortem brain samples, providing a snapshot of potential
transcriptional regulatory abnormalities associated with disease neuropathology. Dr. Haghighi's clinical studies
show how environmental exposure affects the epigenome. Specifically, in her studies involving traumatic brain
injury, she investigates how response to repeated blast-exposure induces long-term transcriptional regulatory

Additionally, she investigates how the role of stress, specifically chronic stress, induces epigenetic changes
associated with depression and suicide in the Veteran population."
10901922,"By 2030, three-quarters of the 22 million US cancer survivors will be 65 and older and the number of older
Hispanic and Black survivors will have grown three times faster than Whites. These shifting demographics are
driving a crisis in cancer care due to a paucity of evidence to guide care for older survivors, especially older
racial/ethnic survivors for whom data is virtually lacking. Filling these gaps will require an understanding of
several complex multidirectional relationships at the intersection of health disparities, aging and cancer.
Compared to older White survivors, older racial/ethnic minority survivors have had more lifetime exposures to
adverse social determinants of health. These exposures accelerate aging processes. Aging increases the risk
of developing cancer through accumulated damage and mutations. Cancer and its therapies, in turn, are disease
drivers of aging. Together, these intersecting forces are likely to exacerbate current racial/ethnic cancer
disparities in the health and quality of life of older survivors. The vision for this Outstanding Investigator Award
is to fundamentally shift how we approach cancer disparities by providing a mechanistic understanding of the
role of cellular aging in the relationships between social determinants of health and survivorship outcomes. I will
use a conceptual model that integrates a multi-level disparities framework with oncology and geroscience
perspectives to conduct research using transcriptomic and other -omics analyses, epigenetics, machine learning,
mediation models, meta-synthesis and population simulation methods. The broad goals of my transdisciplinary
research program are to: 1) discover cellular aging processes in large cohorts of older Black, Hispanic and
White survivors that explain relationships between health determinants and quality of life (e.g., via stress
signaling and downstream effects on cellular aging via inflammatory gene expression), 2) define mechanistic
pathways suggested by cohort results and test the impact of interventions targeting those pathways in a
preclinical model of cancer survivorship and 3) translate results to practice and policy. During my continuously
NIH-funded research career, I have made transformative contributions that support my proposed research
program. There are few population scientists with the unique background and proven track record to successfully
conduct this in-depth research program spanning the full translational continuum from preclinical to cohort
studies and practice and policy. Collaboration with scientists from outside my discipline will support my success
and generate novel insights. The newly established Georgetown Lombardi Institute on Cancer and Aging that I
lead and exceptional institutional commitment and infrastructure provide an exceptional environment. This
Outstanding Investigator Award will provide me with the stability needed to accelerate knowledge in an
understudied research area with high public health significance and clinical relevance. Identification and testing
of aging mechanistically-based interventions will support efforts to tailor clinical care for the burgeoning older
minority survivor population and could to transform how we approach cancer disparities in the context of aging."

 Tick-borne diseases are on the increase and are responsible for nearly all of the vector-transmitted disease
in the US. Vector-borne pathogens face the dual challenge of adaptation to two very different host
environments: the arthropod vector and the mammalian host. Ticks contain distinct physiological cues
including disparities in body temperature, nutrient availability, physiological architecture, and unique
immunological pressures. Once in the tick, A. phagocytophilum must further adapt to construct a replicative
niche within the arthropod’s cells. In response to the tick environment, A. phagocytophilum differentially
transcribes 41% of its genes when infecting tick cells in comparison to mammalian cell culture. It is not known
what controls this extensive reprogramming or how it facilitates A. phagocytophilum adaptation to the tick. One
predicted transcription factor, tr1, displays the highest tick-specific expression of all A. phagocytophilum genes.
Our structural modeling identifies Tr1 as a homo-dimeric helix-turn-helix DNA binding protein in the xenobiotic
response element family of transcription factors. Disruption of tr1 by transposon insertion had no impact on
bacterial burden in mice or growth in human cell lines. However, A. phagocytophilum lacking tr1 was greatly
attenuated for acquisition by ticks and is unable to survival in tick cells. Given the importance of Tr1 for survival
in the arthropod vector and its predicted role as a transcriptional switch, we hypothesize that: Tr1 operates as a
master regulator for tick adaptation by orchestrating the expression of tick-specific gene networks. In this study
we will identify the DNA sequences bound by Tr1 and its mode of transcription regulation. Further, we will
identify how Tr1 contributes to completion of the tick cell infection cycle and measure how Tr1 remodels the A.
phagocytophilum transcriptome during tick cell infection. Revealing how A. phagocytophilum adapts to infect
tick cells will open the door to development of vector targeted interventions to reduce transmissibility of the
pathogen."

Cryptococcus neoformans is a devastating opportunistic fungus that causes hundreds of thousands of deaths
each year, mainly in developing countries. The most abundant component of its plasma membrane is ergosterol,
which is also a compelling topic of study because it is the target of the most powerful antifungal drugs available.
How this compound is transported within the cell has never been studied in C. neoformans, constituting a major
gap in our knowledge of a critical lipid. Our preliminary results suggest that novel factors are involved in this
movement, and that identifying them may be amenable to genetic approaches.
The long-term goal of our research is to define the mechanisms of lipid transport in C. neoformans, to advance
our fundamental understanding and improve the outcome of this dangerous infection. In this R21 proposal we
focus on ergosterol transport. In Aim 1 we will apply a whole genome-scale genetic screen to discover genes
whose products influence ergosterol levels at the plasma membrane. In Aim 2 we will isolate and investigate
sequences that suppress a defect in retrograde traffic of ergosterol from the plasma membrane to the endoplas-
mic reticulum. In Aim 3 we will address the functions of prioritized genes from the first two aims, including studies
of growth, virulence, sterol content, and protein and lipid localization. These experiments will be enabled by our
expertise in cryptococcal biology and advice from expert colleagues, which we will integrate into thoughtful and
rigorous studies. Together, they will increase our understanding of cryptococcal ergosterol transport and position
us for further mechanistic investigations of proteins that we discover to be involved in this process.
Current antifungal drugs that target ergosterol and its synthesis are hampered by factors that include toxicity,
drug interactions, and resistance. It is therefore critical to find other vulnerabilities in this system that can be
productively exploited – our proposed studies are a focused step on this path. Completing them will advance
genomic methods for fungal discovery, deepen our knowledge of lipid transport, and open the door to future
mechanistic studies."
10863892,"Project Summary - Abstract
Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are key components of the airway epithelium playing a major role in mucociliary
clearance, the first line of lung defense against inhaled pathogens. MCCs are well-known targets of viral
pathogens, including influenza A, SARS-COVID2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), often resulting in severe
respiratory conditions with long-term sequelae and morbidity. Still there are major gaps of knowledge on the
mechanisms by which these pathogens trigger airway disease. MCCs require production and apical localization
of a large number of proteins essential for the assembly of hundreds of cilia per cell during multiciliogenesis. The
mechanisms that allow efficient production and local translation of these proteins in MCCs are still poorly
understood. There is evidence that during viral infection, the host’s cellular translation machinery is hijacked to
produce viral proteins for replication. How local translation is established in MCCs and targeted in viral infection
will be studied in this proposal. Our preliminary studies revealed a striking expression of translation initiation
factors (eIFs), ribosomal proteins and nascent polypeptides colocalized with miRNAs, Trinucleotide repeat-
containing 6a (TNRC6a) and Argonaute 2 (AGO2) in immature MCCs undergoing multiciliogenesis. These
signals were concentrated in not yet reported apical cytoplasmic granules, which we named as Localized
Translation granules (LT granules). Surprisingly, unlike other granules traditionally associated with miRNA
function, no enzymes required for mRNA degradation were detected in LT granules. Instead, LT granules were
highly active sites of protein translation. Notably, disrupting Tnrc6a expression, disturbed local translation and
resulted in defective multicilia formation, a phenotype we also observed in RSV-infected MCCs. Here we will test
the hypotheses that i) components of the miRNA pathway recruit subsets of mRNAs and the translation
machinery to LT granules for local efficient large-scale protein synthesis during MCC differentiation; ii) disruption
of this local translation program is a key determinant in the pathogenesis of RSV infection. Thus, we propose to
identify mechanisms that target mRNAs (Aim 1) and recruit the translation machinery (Aim 2) to LT granules in
MCCs, and determine how RSV disrupts these mechanisms to infect the human airway epithelium (Aim 3). The
knowledge generated from these studies will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms of local
translation in multiciliogenesis and the pathogenesis of RSV infection in the respiratory tract.
RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are crucial components of the defense
mechanisms of the lung. Viral infections in the immature epithelium of conducting airways can have devastating
effects in infants or adults with compromised respiratory function. Novel information generated from these studies
will advance our understanding of how proper ciliogenesis is regulated, and how viral infections, such as RSV
disrupt cilia formation in immature respiratory tract."
10886104,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The spread of antibiotic resistance is a growing concern as the emergence of resistance mechanisms
among human pathogens is occurring more rapidly than the development of new antimicrobial agents. This issue
contributes to the inability to fully clear persistent infections such as chronic wound and lung infections, which
represent a major source of human morbidity and mortality. In turn, the inability to eradicate these persistent
infections creates more opportunities for the evolution of novel microbial mechanisms to circumvent therapeutic
treatment, exacerbating the problem of antibiotic resistance. There are multiple aspects of the chronic infection
environment that contribute to therapeutic failure and the emergence of antibiotic resistance. First, several
stressors encountered at the host-pathogen interface are mutagenic, which helps drive evolutionary adaptation
in these sites. Second, the polymicrobial nature of many chronic infections can contribute to the spread of
resistance mechanisms via horizontal gene transfer. The presence of polymicrobial communities can also further
compound the issue of therapeutic clearance of infection since interspecies microbial interactions are known to
alter bacterial physiological and lead to antimicrobial tolerance. In this proposal, we seek to target both the
microbial evolutionary trajectory at the host-pathogen interface and the polymicrobial nature of chronic infections
to design improved therapeutic strategies for eradication of pathogens contributing to otherwise persistent
infections. In Aim 1, we propose to target antibiotic resistant isolates through the identification of vulnerability
tradeoffs that can occur as the cell shifts its fundamental physiology to cope with antibiotic exposure. In addition
to published examples of this phenomenon, we demonstrate our ability to uncover novel examples of tradeoffs
that can be exploited to eradicate otherwise recalcitrant microorganisms. We seek to uncover more examples of
vulnerability tradeoffs and determine the effectiveness of targeting these tradeoffs in a murine model of chronic
wound infection. In Aim 2, we establish polymicrobial community wound pathogen models and use a
methodology that we propose can be adapted for use in the clinical laboratory to demonstrate shifts in antibiotic
efficacy driven by polymicrobial interactions. We demonstrate that both polymicrobial synergism (a reduction in
antibiotic efficacy in complex bacterial communities) and polymicrobial antagonism (an increase in antibiotic
efficacy in the context of a polymicrobial consortium) can be readily observed. Preliminary data suggest that
combinatorial treatment strategies can be developed to exploit polymicrobial antagonism to overcome synergistic
interactions. We propose to validate this strategy in a murine model of chronic wound infection. Together, these
Aims will be used to identify antibiotic treatment strategies that will extend the efficacy of the currently available
repertoire of antibiotics."

The costs and management of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders are borne by families, the backbone
of the care system for persons living with dementia (PLWD). More than 11 million informal caregivers currently
guide the daily lives, fortunes, and care system interactions of PLWD. Promoting effective coping behaviors by
strengthening caregivers’ capacities for navigating interactions with systems and structures that provide
needed care for PLWD may reduce the high levels of caregiver stress. Ensuring that these systems and
structures are effectively accessed and deployed may benefit PLWD. The purpose of this study is to test the
Caregiver as Navigator: Develop Skills Online (CAN-DO) program on caregiver mastery and emotional well-
being as well as caregiver-reported quality of life and behavioral symptoms of their person.
CAN-DO focuses on healthcare navigation to include interactions with health, legal, social service, financial
and family care systems and care management activities, recognizing that social determinants affect these
interactions. This proposal builds on a wait-list control pilot study, Caregiving during Crisis, which assessed the
acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a self-paced, online, asynchronous educational program
developed to promote caregivers’ mastery of skills for managing care and navigating care systems during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Pilot results confirm the pilot study’s primary and secondary hypotheses. We found a
significant group x time difference (p=.041) with a moderate effect size (d-0.524) between the intervention
(N=37) and usual care wait-list control (N=38) group at the 2-month point on the key measure of caregiver
mastery and comparable significant results for improvements in caregivers’ depressive symptoms and
caregiver burden. Participant feedback also guides this iteration of content expansion and course interactivity.
The CAN-DO study will employ a three-arm wait-list RCT design in which data will be gathered at baseline and
then 2, 4, 6, and 8 months later using standard instruments. We will enroll and intentionally diverse sample of
270 caregivers to be clustered in cohorts of 15 and then randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to three study
groups: CAN-DO; a “Healthy Living” attention control condition of comparable size and interactivity; and usual
care. We will conduct qualitative interviews to guide further enhancements."
10881981,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Significance: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an extremely devastating disease with reported median survivals ranging
from 13 to 73 months and 5-year survivals of less than 20% in children and about 15 months with less than 5%
5-year survival rate for adult patients. Cancer immunotherapy using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T
cells is a promising treatment, however its efficacy in GBM has been limited.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the fierce competition for nutrients within the tumor microenvironment,
especially glucose, between tumor cells and the immune system, imposes an abundant metabolic pressure to
CAR T cells dampening their effector function and intratumoral infiltration, expansion, and persistence.
Objective: The goal of this study is to validate a new strategy to overcome this metabolic imbalance and provide
a competitive advantage to CAR T cells over tumor cells. We propose to improve CAR T cell therapy by
enhancing metabolic fitness to outcompete GBM cells for nutrients like glucose.
Methods: Our approach will be to directly target the first step of glucose metabolism (i.e., uptake) by permanent
overexpression of GLUT1 or GLUT3 and generating the following CAR T cells: CD70CAR.G1 and CD70CAR.G3.
The murine model of glioma KR158B, derived from Nf1;Trp53 mutant mouse, that we engineered to express
CD70 as well as CD70 expressing human GBM patient-derived cell lines will be used for the following aims:
Specific Aims
 1. Investigate the phenotypic and functional characteristics of metabolically modified CD70CAR T cells,
 2. Evaluate in vivo the metabolic TME of animals treated with CD70CAR.G1 or CD70CAR.G3,
 3. Examine the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of CD70CAR.G1 or CD70CAR.G3."
10890164,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: A nationwide moratorium was instituted on all elective clinical services in March 2020 to slow the
transmission of COVID-19, safeguard patients, and preserve healthcare resources. This led to a major
disruption in cancer screening and diagnostic procedures. Among Veterans nationwide, we found a significant
and persistent decrease in the detection of new cancers. Without routine screening and easy access to
medical care, cancer patients may go undetected, only presenting when the cancer is beyond curative therapy.
The unprecedented COVID-related disruptions may also have exacerbated preexisting disparities in cancer
outcomes among disadvantaged populations.
Significance: With no information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer outcomes or changes
in outcome disparities, health systems cannot identify populations at risk or implement programs to mitigate
current deficits. We need a comprehensive evaluation of how pandemic disruptions to cancer care are
affecting cancer outcomes. In addition, we need a surveillance system to assess changes in cancer outcomes
over time, as the impacts of the pandemic evolve and mitigation efforts are implemented. We hypothesize that
cancer outcomes in the COVID era will worsen, with higher rates of 1) mortality, 2) cancer recurrence, and 3)
metastatic disease at presentation. Additionally, disparities in the above outcomes will be exacerbated in the
COVID era among patients in the following vulnerable subgroups: female, age > 60 years, Black, Latino, rural,
or in zip codes with lower SES. We will evaluate these hypotheses through the following Specific Aims: 1)
Identify differences in cancer outcomes between the COVID and pre-COVID eras by cancer type. 2) Identify
disparities in cancer outcomes among disadvantaged populations in the COVID era.
Methodology: Using detailed, nationwide, patient-level data from the Veterans Administration Informatics and
Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), we will evaluate changes cancer outcomes from the pre-COVID (March 1,
2018 through February 29, 2020) to COVID (March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2025) era. Poisson and Cox
Proportional Hazards models will be used to analyse the change from the pre-COVID to COVID era by cancer
type and among vulnerable subgroups.
Next Steps/Implementation: The VINCI dataset offers a unique opportunity to provide near real-time
assessment of the impacts of ongoing disruptions in new cancer identification on cancer outcomes and the
exacerbation of existing disparities in a healthcare crisis. This project will allow us to develop actionable data
and a system of surveillance to guide interventions that address the identified disparities. Using the validated
system developed in this project, we will expand to populations outside of the VA and initiate interventional
studies to mitigate or eliminate the identified disparities."

 Leishmania parasites cause a suite of devastating Neglected Tropical Diseases that afflict as many as
one million people per year. Genetic tools for understanding important questions in Leishmania biology are
currently quite limited. Most Leishmania species lack the capacity for RNA interference (RNAi), precluding the
implementation of genome-scale RNAi library screens like those that have revolutionized molecular genetics in
the related kinetoplastid T. brucei. However, the Viannia subgenus, which includes Leishmania braziliensis,
has retained the RNAi machinery. We have developed the first inducible RNAi system for L. braziliensis and
have adapted it for high throughput Loss-of-Function RNAi screens. The overall goal of this proposal is to
generate and validate a novel, genome-scale, inducible RNAi library in L. braziliensis that will serve as a
versatile new genetic tool for the field. Despite differences in the capacity for RNAi, the genome organization,
life cycle stages, and disease pathology of L. braziliensis are very similar to other Leishmania species, making
it likely that results from L. braziliensis RNAi screens will be broadly applicable.
 Our inducible expression system is based on conditional site-specific recombination by a split-Cre
recombinase (DiCre) that is only active in the presence of the inducer rapamycin (Rap). For inducible RNAi,
Rap treatment activates DiCre to invert a pair of tandemly duplicated RNAi target sequences into an
antiparallel orientation. Transcription of this inverted repeat generates a long double-stranded RNA stem-loop
that serves as a trigger for RNAi knockdown of the targeted mRNA. Specific Aim 1 has three components: 1)
We will generate a genome-scale plasmid library of random ~1 kb L. braziliensis genomic DNA fragments that
will serve as RNAi targeting sequences. 2) This plasmid library will be converted to a barcoded inducible stem-
loop RNAi library via a method developed in our lab called Strand Displacement Duplication (SDD); 3) The
inducible stem-loop RNAi library will be stably transfected into a DiCre-expressing L. braziliensis strain, using
CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage to improve library integration efficiency. Because the overall goal is to make the RNAi
library available as a resource for the community, we will validate the library by performing proof-of-principle
screens to identify drug resistance genes (Gain-of-Fitness) and pathways required for normal growth (Loss-of-
Fitness) (Specific Aim2). The representation of RNAi target sequences in library under various growth
conditions will be assessed via an adaptation of the barcode sequencing method (Bar-seq).
 The L. braziliensis RNAi library platform will provide an innovative and much-needed new tool for high
throughput genetic screens in Leishmania. We anticipate that genome-scale RNAi screens will have a
sustained impact on the field by revealing mechanisms of drug action and resistance, and uncovering proteins
and pathways required for surviving any growth condition or lifecycle stage."
10909300,"Calorie restriction (CR) has anti-aging effects, prolongs lifespan and reduces the incidence of age associated
diseases. Experimental evidence in animal models indicates that CR ameliorates the neuropathologic and
behavioral abnormalities seen in transgenic models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our previous work
demonstrated that one mechanism by which CR promotes longevity is by reducing core body-temperature (Tb).
Since virtually all proteins are sensitive to heat denaturation, nature has created cellular systems to protect cells
from even small quantities of abnormally folded toxic proteins as far back in evolution as bacteria. We now
hypothesize that the beneficial effects that CR has on the AD models are at least in part due to its ability to
reduce Tb and the subsequent proteotoxic stress. Here we propose experiments to test our hypothesis regarding
the role of lowering body temperature as being a major factor in both life extension and the salutary effect of CR
in the well validated Tg2576 transgenic model of human AD."
10899687,"Most people living with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (PLWD) prefer to remain at home in the community, yet research shows that they are less likely than people without Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) to successfully return to the community following nursing facility stays. Medicaid’s Money Follows the Person (MFP) program has successfully helped over 100,000 individuals return to community living after nursing facility stays, and Connecticut has one of the highest rates of participation among over 40 participating states. Research finds PLWD have decreased access to the MFP program and lower odds of successfully moving out of nursing facilities, yet it is unknown what mechanisms are leading to these disparities. This study asks why these disparities exist and what is causing them in order to identify policy levers to improve equity for PLWD. We will also analyze differences by race and ethnicity, based on evidence that in Connecticut non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic MFP participants are more likely than non-Hispanic White participants to complete moves back to the community. Using a mixed-methods approach we will identify individual, family, organizational, and community factors which influence three distinct outcomes: applications submitted to the MFP program, completed moves from nursing facility to community homes, and sustained community living. The study’s three aims include: Aim 1: in-depth interviews with individuals with and without AD/ADRD and their informal caregivers to identify barriers and facilitators of their participation and success in MFP; Aim 2: asking staff involved in each step of the MFP program about mechanisms contributing to different experiences for PLWD and potential levers for change; and Aim 3: identifying how mechanisms such as individual health, family support, and organizational practices contribute to disparities in MFP applications, completed moves, and sustained community living through quantitative analysis of approximately 55,000 Connecticut Medicaid nursing facility residents. This study builds upon our team’s 14+ years as the evaluator of the state’s MFP program, our long-standing relationship with Connecticut’s Department of Social Services (the state Medicaid administrator) which is enthusiastic about improving health equity in MFP for this population. The study also leverages a constellation of rich MFP data collected by and uniquely accessible to our team and merges it with Medicaid and Medicare claims data and Minimum Data Set (MDS) data to create a powerful analytic dataset for analyzing MFP outcomes. The study is innovative in conceptualization of three outcomes representing different potential points where disparities emerge along the MFP process continuum, taking advantage of rich untapped and unique data on the MFP program and participants, and an academic-government research partnership with a commitment from our state policy partner who is ready to modify Connecticut’s MFP program to improve health equity for PLWD."

Mineralized enamel is the hardest tissue in the human body, and its proper formation is critical for the protection
and maintenance of healthy teeth for a lifetime. Enamel biomineralization is directed by the epithelial-derived
ameloblasts. Ameloblasts secrete enamel matrix proteins first, which are then hydrolyzed and replaced by
hydroxyapatite crystals in the maturation process. During the maturation process, the pH of the enamel matrix
modulates periodically to be acidic in approximately 80% of the maturation stage, with the remaining
approximately 20% of the time remaining neutral. Maturation stage ameloblasts also modulate periodically along
with the matrix pH cycling, changing cell morphology and functions. When pH cycling is disrupted by gene
mutants or environmental factors that dysregulate ameloblast modulation, enamel maturation is dysregulated,
resulting in hypomineralized, poorly formed enamel. However, the mechanisms that drive both matrix pH cycling
and ameloblast modulation interactions are poorly understood. In preliminary studies, we found amelogenins
can differentially affect cell morphology and adhesion in a pH-dependent manner; and ameloblast modulation is
associated with changes in focal adhesion-P13k-AKT signaling pathways. Furthermore, we identified possible
contributions of matrix pH to the function of the pH-dependent multifunctional enzyme, transglutaminase 2, in
regulating amelogenin hydrolysis in the maturation of enamel matrix. In these proposed studies we will address
the central hypothesis that enamel matrix pH regulates ameloblast function, protein structure, and matrix
mineralization. We will use both in vitro and in vivo models with alterations in endocytosis, calcium transport,
matrix hydrolysis and pH, to test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims. 1) To determine the
effect of extracellular pH on adhesion and modulation of maturation stage ameloblasts; 2) To determine
the effect of pH and calcium on integrin-mediated focal adhesion - PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathways
of ameloblasts; 3) To determine the significance of matrix pH on Transglutaminase 2 activity in the
maturation stage enamel matrix. These studies will allow us to better understand the etiology of enamel
hypomineralization, and they will allow us to apply this knowledge to reduce the risk of enamel defects.
Furthermore, the findings from these studies will contribute to our long-term goal to identify strategies for enamel
tissue bioengineering, repair, and the use of enamel proteins therapeutic purposes."

Disrupted attention is among the earliest-emerging, lifelong features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and
research suggests a critical point in the neonatal and early infant period at which disrupted attention may be
detectable. The timing of this disruption aligns with key maturational shifts in neurodevelopment, but the
neurobiological mechanisms associated with disrupted attention in ASD remain elusive. One neurobiological
system that regulates attention from early infancy is the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Broad ANS
dysfunction is observed in older children already diagnosed with ASD, but whether and when ANS dysfunction
contributes to attention abnormalities in ASD remains unknown. The overall goal of this study is to examine
how atypical autonomic regulation of attention may be associated with the emergence of ASD symptoms. A
key marker of autonomic regulation of attention is heart defined attention. Accordingly, maturation of heart
defined attention in the early infant period and the developmental consequences therein for the emergence of
interactive behaviors and ASD symptoms will be examined. A critical innovation of this study is leveraging a
three-group design in which infants who experience elevated ASD symptoms (infant siblings of children with
ASD; ASIBs) will be compared to typically developing (TD) and preterm (PT) control groups. Infants born
preterm experience broad ANS dysfunction from birth and comparing ASIBs to PTs will help delineate how
attention-specific ANS dysfunction predicts the emergence of ASD-specific symptoms. Aim 1 will compare the
emergence of autonomic regulation of attention during a very critical period of neurodevelopment (1-3 months)
across ASIBs, PT infants, and TD infants. Aim 2 will quantify the association between heart defined attention
and interactive behavior on a moment-to-moment basis at 6, 9, and 12 months, and compare across the three
groups. Aim 3 will utilize machine learning techniques to predict ASD symptoms at age 3 years from early
autonomic and attentional features (from Aims 1-2). Determining the specificity of autonomic regulation of
attention as a key, early emerging feature associated with ASD, has significant translational potential for a
cost-effective biomarker. This work will inform developmental models of ASD wherein disrupted autonomic
regulation of attention has proximal effects on real-world interactions that may interfere with learning and have
cascading effects on long-term outcomes."

 use initial feedback from interviews to “optimize material”.
 pilot the interactive mobile-friendly web application
 obtain feedback from investigative teams from across the country on the feasibility and acceptability of
 incorporating multi-media materials in real-world assent/consent implementation.
To accomplish these aims, the infrastructure for semi-structured interviews will be established in Aim 1. Then

 Despite the remarkable successes of targeted cancer therapies, certain cancers, including lung, breast, and
prostate cancer and melanoma, invariably become resistant to therapy. One mechanism of secondary
resistance—lineage plasticity—arises when cells transition into aggressive states, and, in the case of prostate
cancer, acquire a neuroendocrine histology. This results in a rapid downhill course for a subset of the so–termed
castrate–resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. This, in essence, not only poses a clinical challenge, but
also confronts us with a wide–open biological question—what are the molecular underpinnings of lineage
plasticity, and importantly, can the process be reversed? We have very recently documented that the activation
of JAK/STAT and FGFR signaling pathways promote lineage plasticity and result in complete insensitivity to
androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) [*Chan, *Zaidi, et al., Science, 2022, PMID: 35981096, *co–
first authors]. Importantly, we found that FDA–approved inhibitors of JAK/STAT (ruxolitinib) and FGFR
(erdafitinib) synergize to reverse lineage plasticity and restore ARSI sensitivity. We therefore hypothesize that
signals downstream of JAK/STAT and FGFR, including novel transcription factors, interact to promote lineage
plasticity, and their timed perturbation can reverse plasticity and ARSI insensitivity. Thus, in Specific Aim 1, to
study how FGFR signals synergize with JAK/STAT to impart plasticity, we will use chemical inhibitors and
CRISPR–Cas9 to delete specific molecules in TP53/RB1–null mouse and human tumor organoids. Specific
Aim 2 will focus on further deconvoluting the molecular complexity of lineage plasticity through unbiased single
cell paired RNA and ATAC (multiome) sequencing in murine organoids. We expect to identify novel transcription
factors and study their DNA accessibility post–TP53/RB1 deletion across the evolution of lineage plasticity, with
and without ruxolitinib and/or erdafitinib. In Specific Aim 3, in proof–of–concept in vivo studies, we will examine
the efficacy of combined treatment with ruxolitinib plus erdafitinib in reversing lineage plasticity and restoring
ARSI sensitivity. For this, the ruxolitinib+erdafitinib combination will be studied in NOD SCID mice grafted either
with TP53/RB1–null murine organoids, orthotopically, or with the human tumoroid MSK–PCA3, subcutaneously.
These studies will not only inform future therapeutic strategies to subvert drug resistance in CRPC patients but
should also provide a unique platform for my Training Aims. Under the tutelage of my primary mentor, Dr.
Charles Sawyers, and my Advisory Committee, I expect to enhance my competencies in advanced computation,
cancer modeling and genetic editing, and bedside translation. Together with the rich scientific environment and
vast array of resources at MSKCC, my research and training should position me to achieve my goal of becoming
an independently funded physician–investigator in genitourinary oncology by the end of this grant period."

The recent convergence of the overdose epidemic and continued racialized police violence has accelerated
efforts to mitigate the racially disparate harms of policing toward people who use drugs (PWUD) by aligning
law enforcement’s role as first responders with evidence-based public health approaches to drug use rooted in
harm reduction. Police departments now commonly equip officers with naloxone, participate in partnerships
with healthcare service providers, and have a lead role in celebrated diversion programs targeting PWUD and
other marginalized populations. Despite initial evaluations of these approaches showing promise in isolation,
widespread and enduring reform across the institution of policing has not materialized. Punitive enforcement of
drug offenses remains central to the institution of policing. True harmonization of criminal justice and public
health systems requires broad changes to well-established cultural and institutional norms. The proposed R36
application builds on pilot program evaluations and studies examining changes in isolated measures of police
enforcement by examining how police officers in Baltimore City, Maryland, negotiate, contest, and make sense
of drug policy reforms and guidance from public health authorities in order to understand how the broader
cultural shift toward evidence-based approaches to substance use is being translated into policing practices
that are ultimately experienced by PWUD. Through in-depth interviews with Baltimore Police Department
(BPD) leadership (n=20), observations of BPD public-facing events (n=15), and observational ride-alongs with
street-level officers (n=60), this research aims to qualitatively explore, 1) how police leadership integrate harm
reduction approaches to drug enforcement into the department’s organizational approach to PWUD, and 2)
street-level officers’ beliefs, attitudes, and enforcement practices towards PWUD. Analysis of interview
transcripts and observation fieldnotes will be conducted using an abductive approach, drawing on theories and
concepts from studies of organizations and organizational change, police culture, risk environments and
structural determinants of health. The PI of the proposed R36 application, Bradley Silberzahn, is a doctoral
candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin). Brad will lead all
study procedures, as well as a broader expert panel comprised of faculty from UT Austin, Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health, and New York University’s School of Global Public Health. This research
will inform ongoing debates over drug policy and the role of law enforcement in harm reduction, as well as
identify barriers and avenues for widespread and enduring police reform that facilitates police enforcement
practices that are in alignment with, not antithetical to, public health."
10891713,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular death is the number one cause of mortality for children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) once
they reach adulthood. There is limited knowledge of the biochemical pathophysiology of left ventricular
hypertrophy (LVH) and ventricular dysfunction (VD), prognostic markers of future adverse cardiac outcomes in
pediatric CKD, and a dearth of targeted or preventive interventions. Metabolite associations with cardiac
outcomes in children with CKD have been identified through plasma untargeted metabolomic profiling in the
Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study. Multi-omics investigations can better elucidate
pathomechanism and have to led to significant discoveries; however, studies in pediatric CKD have been limited.
This proposal builds upon previous metabolomics work by integrating genotyping data to identify causal gene-
metabolite axes with left LVH and VD in pediatric CKD. This work seeks to answer two specific aims, 1) if there
is genetic variation associated with circulating metabolite levels that have been previously associated with
pediatric CKD cardiovascular outcomes and 2) if circulating metabolite levels have causal effects on LVH and
VD in pediatric CKD. Circulating metabolite levels' association with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will
be assessed through metabolomics-genome wide association studies (mGWAS) analyses. Metabolite causality
on LVH and VD pathogenesis will be assessed with bidirectional Mendelian randomization, leverage genotype
data as instrument variables. Elucidation of pathophysiology of LVH and VD in pediatric CKD may inform
continued research investigations and development of therapeutic targets, aiding in the eventual prevention and
treatment of cardiac risk factors in this underexamined population in clinical practice. In addition to the scientific
pursuits of this career development award, Dr. Arthur Lee will make significant advances toward developing his
career as an independent clinician investigator. Dr. Lee's career goals are to 1) extend the science of his R38
metabolomics work through the integration of genomics data, 2) gain skills in biostatistics by working with
genomics data and multi-omics analyses, and 3) to continue receiving mentorship and formalized didactical
training in large data-based clinical research. Dr. Lee will meet regularly with his primary mentor and two working
groups, and will receive feedback from his mentoring committee quarterly. Dr. Lee will pursue a Masters of
Science in Translational Research (MSTR), with a concentration in Bioinformatics, which advances future
researchers through didactive coursework, a formal mentorship program, research training, professional skills
development program, and guidance towards protocol and grant development. Completion of this K38 research
will result in abstract submissions to national conferences and first-author manuscripts for each aim. Altogether,
this proposal will serve as a bridge leading to a NIH early career funding proposal, analogous to how the R38
served as a pipeline to this K38 application."
11170047,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Diagnostic errors affect 12 million patients in the U.S. and contribute to 80,000 deaths per year. The main causes
for diagnostic errors include cognitive biases introduced by healthcare providers, miscommunication between
healthcare teams, lack of access to key data, and not recognizing time-sensitive data in the electronic health
record (EHR). The cognitive burden from information overload in the EHR cause clinicians to take decisional
shortcuts with biased heuristics and miss critical data in the EHR, leading to missed opportunities for timely and
accurate diagnoses. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and clinical Natural Language Processing (cNLP) provide
opportunity to help understand medical text and can automate EHR analysis, pointing to the promising direction
of invoking medical knowledge and clinical experience as humans do. However, the majority of the cNLP tasks
are not designed for bedside application to generate diagnoses and augment bedside decision-making. We have
have gathered preliminary data and designed cNLP benchmark tasks for clinical diagnostic reasoning. Our tasks
address key cognitive processes to build models in this proposal that can synthesize EHR data to generate
diagnoses that align with evidence-based medicine and medical knowledge representation. The proposal aims
to develop novel cNLP models that understand and integrate multi-modal EHR data, and conduct reasoning over
a large-scale medical knowledge base to build a model that provides higher accuracy than current neural network
models. I will first develop a multi-modal generative model that reads in both structured and unstructured EHR
data to output diagnoses using a two-stage training process (Aim 1). In a separate aim, I will construct a
knowledge base using a neural symbolic approach from medical concepts and relations sourced from the
National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The knowledge base will be part of
the model to generate diagnoses given the information from a daily care note collected in the EHR (Aim 2). The
third aim will design and pilot a clinical diagnostic decision support system using human-centered design
principles. The best models from Aims 1 and 2 will be evaluated for diagnostic accuracy by clinicians in the
system using previously validated instruments for patient safety and diagnostic error (Aim 3). Completion of the
aims will inform future clinical studies on developing NLP-driven clinical decision support tools for reducing
diagnostic error. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my co-mentors and advisors who have
expertise in developing clinical neural language models, implementation of AI-driven tools in health systems,
and clinical decision support systems with augmented intelligence. Together, this multidisciplinary team brings
nationally renowned expertise in clinical informatics with a track record of successful mentorship. My 4-year
proposal with intensive mentorship, clinical research training, formal coursework in health systems engineering
and informatics, and computing resources at the University of Wisconsin-Madison will ensure my success as I
grow into an independent scientist."
10913592,"Project Summary/Abstract
In this R21 proposal, we will use implementation science approaches to study delivery of equitable syphilis
prevention, doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP), in a clinic-based setting. Innovative strategies for
syphilis prevention are needed to address the growing national epidemic, with disproportionate burden of disease
among Black and Hispanic/Latinx sexual and gender minority persons (SGM) who have sex with men. In
Chicago specifically, syphilis rates have been rising steadily, syndemic with HIV transmission. Existing public
health responses – contact tracing, testing, and treatment – have not stemmed these rising rates. Recent data
show that doxycycline, taken after sexual activity, is very effective at prevention of syphilis for those who may be
exposed. As an emerging evidence-based intervention, key implementation information is needed to ensure
equitable delivery of doxyPEP to maximize impact on the syphilis epidemic. As has been recognized with other
biomedical prevention tools such as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, early identification of barriers to delivery is
imperative. The proposed study will address gaps in doxyPEP delivery using implementation frameworks in
partnership with an SGM-focused health system in Chicago, Illinois, to meet the following aims: 1) Assess
determinants of doxyPEP use at the patient, provider and health system levels; 2) Identify and select community-
informed implementation strategies to support doxyPEP use among populations most affected by the syphilis
epidemic; and 3) Develop and evaluate acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of a doxyPEP
implementation strategy package among patients, providers, and health systems stakeholders. Our mixed
methods approach will be rooted in the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the
Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation Model of Behavior (COM-B), incorporating qualitative methods and
conjoint analysis approaches, to identify important determinants of doxyPEP service delivery. The proposed
research will result in implementation strategies to guide equitable use of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis
among populations most impacted by syphilis."

Organismal and cell rejuvenation are exciting new approaches to counteract aging, and recent breakthroughs
have brought them to the forefront of aging research. For examples, systemic factors in young blood was found
to rejuvenate various mouse tissues and brain function, and partial reprogramming with four stem cell
transcription factors (TFs) (Yamanaka factors) rejuvenate tissues and cells and extend the lifespan of mice.
These discoveries demonstrate that “young” and “old” can be described as different states, and the “old” state
can be reversed back into a “young” state through transcriptional reprogramming.
We hypothesized that there might exist many solutions to human cell rejuvenation through transcriptional
reprogramming, and some of the solutions may be safer and more potent than Yamanaka factors. In a recently
completed project supported by an NIH/NIA R21 grant, the Li lab developed a systematic approach to test this
hypothesis and to find the solutions. Using a human cell culture model of replicative aging employed by
Hayflick (continuously passaged human fibroblast cells), we developed a high throughput screen using
Perturb-seq to identify the potential rejuvenating TFs -- those that when over-expressed or repressed in old
cells, are capable of reprogramming the global gene expression program from the old state back to a younger
state. We identified four TFs/chromatin modifier (E2F3, EZH2, STAT3, ZFX) that when over-expressed or
repressed individually, are able to rejuvenate human fibroblast cells aged in vitro.
Here we propose to further test the rejuvenating effect of these four factors in human fibroblast cells aged in
vivo in their natural tissue environment, and in mouse liver. We will also develop new technologies to screen
for more potent rejuvenating TF combinations and test them in aged human fibroblast cells and in mouse liver.
If successful, this proposed study will identify TFs/TF combinations that can rejuvenate in vitro and in vivo aged
human fibroblast cells and mouse liver. This will set the stage for transgenic mouse study and translation to
human therapies. The methodologies developed in this proposal can be generalized to identify combinatorial
transcriptional programs that produce any desired cellular phenotypes, e.g., the reversion of the cellular state
from disease to normal in cell culture models of diseases."
10892878,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Midline crossing by dorsal commissural axons is a prominent feature of vertebrate and invertebrate nervous
systems, necessary for the left-right coordination of sensory and motor systems, locomotion, and posture. In the
vertebrate spinal cord, dorsal commissural axons extend towards and cross the midline floorplate, and then turn
longitudinally to ascend towards the brain. While the growth cone’s voyage to and across the floorplate has been
intensively studied, its final decision—whether to ascend or descend after emerging from the midline—is less
well understood. Genetic studies clearly implicate the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway in this decision, but
our understanding of how PCP signaling guides the growth cone is incomplete. The PCP pathway is a cell-cell
contact-mediated signaling pathway that transmits polarity information between cells to orient them for directed
migration. Yet our mechanistic understanding of the role of PCP signaling in commissural axon guidance is
largely informed by studies of isolated growth cones in vitro. Thus, A major gap in our understanding of
commissural axon guidance is the role that cell contact-mediated cues play in longitudinal guidance. Using the
transparent zebrafish embryo to visualize the axons and growth cones of single identified pioneer commissural
interneurons in PCP mutants, we have found that core components of the PCP signaling pathway are required
equally within the commissural neuron and in its environment for correct axon targeting. PCP proteins localize
to the growth cone and to the cells on its trajectory. We hypothesize that the growth cone uses PCP signaling to
polarize its growth in response to planar-polarized cues in its immediate neuroepithelial environment. In Aim 1
we will test this hypothesis by locating, in space and time, the requirement for PCP core components in the
growth cone environment, and by quantitative live imaging of growth cone membrane and actin dynamics as it
is making its anterior targeting decision. In Aim 2 we will expand our scope to discover the commissural axon
guidance role of proteins that have been implicated in PCP signaling elsewhere through a targeted G0 CRISPR
screen. Finally, in Aim 3 we will expand our scope once again to test the hypothesis that PCP signaling functions
broadly in longitudinal axon guidance in the spinal cord. The successful outcome of this work will be a deep
mechanistic understanding of how the dorsal commissural neuron growth cone is polarized for anterior growth
in vivo by the Planar Cell Polarity pathway, to enable it to build sensory circuits controlling locomotion and
posture."

The goal of this proposal is to understand how visual signals are transmitted from the outer to the inner retina
through cone bipolar cells (CBC), with a focus on detailed synaptic mechanisms and functional circuits between
morphologically and physiologically identified cone bipolar cell types and specific ganglion and amacrine cell
types in the whole-mount mouse retina. This investigation is motivated by an important observation that,
although recent transcriptomic, connectomic, and imaging studies have significantly advanced our
understanding of bipolar cell classification and anatomical structure, our knowledge of the detailed physiology of
the synapses and circuits formed by these classified CBC types remains very limited. To address this
fundamental gap in our understanding of retinal processing, we developed a new experimental approach, using
dual pre- and post-synaptic patch-clamp recording from pairs of morphologically identified CBC types and
ganglion cell types in the whole-mount mouse retina in conjunction with two-photon optical recording and
targeted expression of genetically encoded glutamate and Ca sensors. This approach allowed us to correlate
the anatomical structure of each morphological CBC type with its intrinsic and receptive-field physiology and,
more importantly, to directly measure, at a millisecond resolution and under voltage-clamp condition, synaptic
transmission from identified CBC types to their postsynaptic targets in a structurally intact retina. Our preliminary
results revealed novel kinetic and circuit properties of CBC that suggested a new mechanism of synaptic
integration using both chemical and electrical synaptic transmission. Based on these preliminary results, we
propose a dual-mode synaptic mechanism by which CBCs transmit both a direct synaptic signal and a gap
junction-coupled network signal to their postsynaptic targets. This hypothesized mechanism will be tested
through the three Specific Aims. Aim 1, dual patch-clamp characterization of synaptic transmission and
functional connectivity between morphologically identified CBC types and a diffused ganglion cell type (W3) in
the whole-mount retina. Aim 2, understand the chemical and electrical synaptic interactions underlying signal
transmission from identified CBC types to W3 cells in the whole-mount retina. Aim 3, determine the functional
impact of different modes of CBC synaptic transmission on diffused and narrowly stratified postsynaptic target
cells. Results from this study are expected to provide novel insights into the synaptic mechanisms and functional
circuitry of cone bipolar cell types in the mammalian retina and shed light on chemical and electrical synaptic
integration in the CNS in general."

How do T cells find and their targets? Thanks to studies using high abundance, high affinity agonists and
antibodies, many of the signaling pathways downstream from TCR engagement – through lck, ZAP-70, LAT,
and further adapters and transcription factors – are described. Decades of structural analyses have also revealed
the critical residues for ligand binding. Yet, as we have attempted to make T cells more tuneable and use them
as cellular therapies, it is evident that we still cannot create a T cell that has all the features—sensitivity,
specificity, effector functions—that we want in order to achieve clinical efficacy.
Receptors reside on cell membranes. Cell membranes move and bend and provide 3D surfaces on which
receptors can transit, both individually and in patches. We hypothesize that the relationship of T cell receptors
to their underlying membrane is critical for determining their function.
This proposal will study the effect of the subsurface domain distribution of receptors, achieved through
engineering of T cells (Aim 1), engineering of surrogate ligands and cells (Aim 2) and through adoption of cell-
cell fusogens that alter the immediate sequellae of membrane-membrane apposition (Aim 3). In all cases, we
will be studying the output across a range of measures, starting by studying the 3D distribution of engineered
receptors over time, moving to studying the effect of the perturbation on activation measures, and finally
assessing these modification in models of human disease. The results of these studies will provide us with critical
information about the interacting nature of receptors and membranes as they influence T cell activation."

Spontaneous patterns of activity is thought to be instructive for the assembly and maturation of multiple brain circuits across several species. Spontaneously driven activity is expected to guide the formation of a neonatal architectural circuit template, which in turn impacts neocortical function throughout life. Disturbances of spontaneous activity patterns have great clinical relevance, as they are liable to lead to permanent miswiring of neocortical circuits, a leading cause for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Accordingly, various studies reveal that disturbances in genetic and environmental factors during neonatal development present high risk for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Yet little is known about how spontaneous patterns of activity control the emergence and maintenance of neocortical connectivity, and how it ultimately impacts in vivo circuit function. Our goal is to understand how spontaneous patterns of network activity orchestrate the proper maturation and function of the visual cortex. The central hypothesis is that spontaneous neonatal activity, such as retinal waves, is critical for the establishment of precise long-range and local neocortical circuits, and that altered visual processing and cognitive functions develop when activity dependent connectivity is disrupted early in life in the primary visual cortex. The rationale for these studies is that they will provide novel insights into neocortical dysfunction in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The specific aims are: 1) Assess the role of spontaneous activity on neonatal gene expression in the visual cortex. 2) Assess the role of spontaneous activity on visual cortex synaptic connectivity. 3) Determine the impact of neonatal spontaneous patterns of activity on visual processing at later ages. Under the first aim, single-cell RNA sequencing experiments will be performed in order to elucidate how spontaneous activity impact gene expression at neonatal ages. Under the second aim, slice electrophysiology experiments will be performed in order to elucidate how spontaneous activity impact synaptic maturation. Under the third aim, in vivo recordings will be performed in order to investigate the role of spontaneous activity for the in vivo function of the visual cortex. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it will open new avenues for studying the role of spontaneous activity for transcriptomics, connectivity, and in vivo function of the neocortex. The proposed research is significant because it will provide novel mechanistic insights into how spontaneous activity might guide the formation of a neonatal architectural circuit template, which in turn impacts neocortical function throughout life."
10839906,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is known to damage the brain and central nervous system directly and indirectly through
infected lymphocytes. These viruses are latent in healthy conditions but reactivate in immunocompromised
individuals with severe consequences. Meanwhile, increasingly diverse literature has established that microRNAs
(miRNAs) are extensively engaged in typical brain development, function, and dysfunction. In humans, 20~23-
nucleotide (nt) miRNAs are loaded into four Argonaute (AGO) proteins, forming RNA-induced silencing complexes
(RISCs) to repress the translation of mRNAs complementary to their miRNAs. Thus, proper gene regulation by
miRNAs is indispensable for generating the neurological system, and their atypical expression patterns reflect the
pathogenesis of neuronal diseases. Since miRNAs are known to circulate in serum, plasma, and other bodily fluids,
they are used as biomarkers for diagnosing many diseases. In this context, we recently discovered that AGO-
associated miRNAs are trimmed to 14-nt or shorter tiny RNAs (tyRNAs) by three 3′→5′ exonucleases: interferon-
stimulated gene 20 kDa (ISG20), three prime repair exonuclease 1, and enhanced RNAi 1. ISG20 is highly expressed
during EBV replication. Notably, our dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that 14-nt tyRNAs no longer retain
gene-silencing activity. These results suggest that viral infection globally converts miRNAs to tyRNAs, thereby making
the gene expression drastically different. According to PubMed, the study of miRNAs has steadily increased, and
more than 200,000 papers have already been published. In contrast, there have only been about 10 papers
discussing tyRNAs, including our recent work, which demonstrates that little is known about tyRNAs. With the
following two specific aims, we will determine the tyRNAs in the four different stages of EBV-infected cells: 1) no
infection, 2) de novo infection, 3) latency, and 4) lytic reactivation (Aim 1). In addition, we will validate the hypothesis
that the herpesvirus infection enhances tyRNA generation in neurodevelopmental disorder patients whose AGO has
specific single-point mutations (Aim 2). The successful outcome of the proposed study will provide the first
comprehensive data sets of tyRNAs as new potential biomarkers. The long-term goal of this study is to provide a
foundation to establish a new frontier in understanding how herpesvirus infection generates tyRNAs and thus
dysregulates gene expression. Obtaining the comprehensive profile of tyRNAs in the proposed project is an essential
first step to proceeding towards a deeper study. The determined tyRNAs are expected to serve as biomarkers and
make previously identified miRNA biomarkers more informative."

In the pediatric emergency department, children who belong to racial, ethnic, and language minority groups are
less likely to receive interventions such as antibiotics and pain medication. Importantly, minority children are
more likely to die of emergency conditions, including sepsis and cardiac arrest. Eliminating inequity requires
strategic and rigorous approaches across multiple levels. Dr. Colleen Gutman is an Assistant Professor of
Pediatric Emergency Medicine at the University of Florida. Her long-term goal is to become an independently
funded physician-scientist with a focus on investigating and implementing strategies to promote equitable,
patient-centered pediatric emergency care. Through the support of a KL2 award, Dr. Gutman gained
introductory skills in multi-center health disparities research, qualitative analysis, and health communication
science. To achieve a successful transition to research independence, Dr. Gutman and her multidisciplinary
mentorship team devised a career development plan that builds from that foundation. With this K23 award, Dr.
Gutman will develop advanced skills in 1) the identification and measurement of implicit bias, 2) the science of
patient-centered communication, 3) advanced mixed methods, 4) academic leadership, and 5) scientific
writing. The career development plan will be complemented by mentored research experiences. Using the
NIMHD Research Framework, the proposed research seeks to define elements of the physician-parent
interaction that contribute to child health disparities. The objective is to define how implicit bias affects
physician behavior in the pediatric emergency department. This is a necessary first step that will inform
targeted interventions aimed at reducing child health disparities. In Aim 1, Dr. Gutman will use a parent-
engaged modified Delphi approach to establish physician behaviors (e.g., assumptions about parent
characteristics and access to resources; communication with parents) that may mediate the relationship
between physician implicit bias and child health disparities. In Aim 2, she will collect paired questionnaires from
pediatric emergency physicians and parents. She will analyze physician-parent response concordance on
items evaluating parent characteristics and access to resources. Through this analysis, she will assess for
systematic differences in the accuracy of physician assumptions based on parent race, ethnicity, and
language. In Aim 3, she will video-record pediatric emergency department encounters to analyze the
relationship between physician communication and parent race, ethnicity, and language. Physician behaviors
that differ for minority parents may mediate the relationship between physician implicit bias and child health
disparities. The findings will inform a multicenter R01 proposal that is fully powered to conduct a mediation
analysis assessing the relative importance of the defined behaviors on patient-centered disparities outcomes.
Long term, this research will inform targeted interventions to reduce disparities in child health."

K24 award will leverage these two trials by applying the RE-AIM framework to examine the interventions’
reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, cost, and maintenance. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Estimate
the short-term cost, population reach and effectiveness of Water First and Heathy Drinks, Healthy Futures
interventions in increasing water intake, decreasing SSB intake, and preventing overweight, 2) Examine the
impact of the interventions among different subgroups (by age, sex, racial/ethnic background, English
proficiency and acculturation level), and 3) Describe how the impact of the interventions differ by fidelity to the
intervention implementation strategies. These data will be used to translate evidence into practice and adapt
the interventions for “real-world” settings. The research will also provide a platform for training experiences in
conduct of CRTs, community-engaged research, dissemination and implementation science, intervention
development, mixed methods, dietary assessment, and statistical analysis. The award will also allow Dr. Patel
to expand her mentoring of early stage clinical investigators pursing translational POR and support her own

Amyloid-beta and tau are hallmarks of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The
relationships of in-vivo amyloid-beta, tau, and neurodegeneration with cognitive, clinical, and genetic markers
are not well understood. Patients with AD pathology exhibit heterogeneity in their clinical symptoms and illness
course. Understanding the underlying neurobiological heterogeneity mechanisms of AD and improving the
outcomes have been the central goals. This proposal leverages complementary information of in-vivo amyloid-
beta positron emission tomography (amyloid PET), tau PET, structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI),
cognitive, clinical, and genetic measurements via advanced machine learning methods and investigates the
relationships among these measurements in patients with MCI/AD relative to normal controls. The proposal will
study the data from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; N = 898) and the Washington
University’s Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC; N = 1,121). This study will be the first to
examine regional amyloid PET, tau PET, and sMRI markers and their relationships with cognitive, clinical, and
genetic phenotypes using machine learning predictive modeling and heterogeneity analytics in AD research. The
proposal will quantify regional PET outcomes as distribution volume ratio (DVR) and sMRI as the volumes and
investigate their associations with cognitive [Mini-mental state examination (MMSE)], clinical [clinical dementia
rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB) and CDR], and genetic [polygenic risk scores (PRS) and apolipoprotein E (APOE)]
measurements. Aim 1 will develop machine learning modeling methods to study the relationships of amyloid
PET, tau PET, and sMRI with cognitive and clinical phenotypes and test the hypothesis of whether regional
brain-based imaging measurements exhibit multivariate predictive associations with cognitive and clinical
phenotypes in MCI/AD patients and controls. Aim 2 will study the regional heterogeneity of amyloid PET, tau
PET, and sMRI outcomes via semi-supervised machine learning methods. The study will compare the imaging
outcomes between identified subgroups of patients or controls vs. each subgroup of patients to test the
hypothesis of whether imaging markers differ between subgroups of patients. Aim 3 will examine the
relationships of amyloid PET, tau PET, and sMRI heterogeneity signatures with cognition and genetics to test
whether imaging signatures associate differentially with cognition and genetics in the subgroups of MCI/AD
relative to controls. Overall, this innovative proposal will yield critical information on AD heterogeneity
mechanisms, and contribute to precision medicine of diagnosis and treatment of AD.

10910122,"Social Connection & Suicide Risk in ADRD Caregivers
Providing care for a family member or friend with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD,
‘caregivers’) is a common experience for adults in mid- and later-life and can foster experiences that are
beneficial to mental health (e.g., purpose, mastery), but can also lead to anxiety, depression, and suicide
ideation. Our scientific premise is that social disconnection—the quality and quantity of social ties with others—
contributes to the most severe mental health problems during caregiving, including suicide ideation and
behavior. Social disconnection is a common experience among caregivers and is one of the strongest risk
factors for suicide ideation, attempts, and deaths. The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide proposes that stressors
such as caregiving increase suicide risk by impacting two forms of social disconnection—feeling lonely (also
termed low belonging) and like one is a burden on others (perceived burden). In line with NIA priorities of
promoting well-being in caregivers and understanding mechanisms, our objective is to examine loneliness (and
low belonging) and perceived burden on others as mechanisms that increase suicide risk in ADRD caregivers.
This study builds on our team’s work on social connection in ADRD caregivers via the Rochester Roybal
Center for Social Ties & Aging Research. Our pilot studies routinely assess suicide risk given the robust link
between social disconnection and suicide risk. We found that at least 10% of caregivers screened for our pilot
studies report suicide ideation in the past month. We propose an observational study of n=200 ADRD
caregivers who report caregiving stress, loneliness, and recent suicide ideation in which subjects complete
baseline interviews (to characterize caregiving and obtain histories of suicide ideation and behavior), 10 days
of smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (daily caregiving stressors and benefits, social
connection, and suicide ideation), and 6-month follow-up (changes in care receiver functional status). Our first
aim is to examine whether daily caregiving experiences are associated with daily variations in loneliness and
perceived burden. We hypothesize that caregiving mastery and sense of purpose in life will be associated with
lower loneliness and greater perceived burden, while caregiving strain, losses, and relationship conflict will be
associated with greater loneliness and perceived burden. Our second aim examines whether loneliness and
perceived burden predict daily variation in suicide ideation. We hypothesize that caregiving stressors will
predict suicide ideation via increases in loneliness and perceived burden. Our third aim is to examine whether
suicide ideation in caregivers is associated with worse caregiving outcomes in the short-term (next day
caregiving stress, fewer positive interactions) and longer-term (functional decline at 6-month follow-up).
Understanding mechanisms whereby caregiving may increase suicide risk could identify social connection as
an intervention target and also increase knowledge about the role of daily stressors in the link between social
disconnection and suicide in mid- and later life."
10916416,"Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is a significant cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, affecting c.
17M people. PACG is more prevalent among women; unfortunately, the underlying reasons for this unequal
prevalence are unknown. Factors other than sex, such as anatomical deficits in the anterior chamber, race, and
age, are associated with PACG, with anatomical deficits being the accepted primary clinical criteria used to
assess PACG risk. However, several clinical trials have shown that such anatomical factors are surprisingly poor
predictors of PACG development, indicating the involvement of other unaccounted factors in PACG.
The pathophysiological mechanisms of PACG are closely related to the biomechanics of the iris. Specifically, in
pupillary block (PB), a key feature of PACG, contact between the iris and the lens induces a pressure gradient
between the anterior and posterior chambers. Subsequently, PB leads to occlusion of the outflow pathway (i.e.,
angle closure [AC]) by anterior deformation of the iris, with associated elevation of intraocular pressure and
potential glaucomatous vision loss. We and others have shown that by using pupillary reflexes (e.g., triggered
by light), one can non-invasively evaluate the biomechanical properties of the iris. Interestingly, in patients with
a history of PACG, the iris is stiffer compared to controls. However, the role of iris biomechanics in inducing AC
and PACG is unknown.
Our central hypothesis is that iris biomechanics plays a crucial, unappreciated role in developing PACG, based
on the natural connection between iridial deformations and iridial biomechanical properties. Therefore, this pro-
ject objective is to investigate the role of iris biomechanics in PACG through the evaluation of iridial biome-
chanical properties and mechanics of AC and PB. In addition, we will investigate sex-dependent differences in
iris biomechanics and their potential role in predisposing women to a higher risk of developing PACG.
This project s specific aims (SA) are: SA1 - Investigate sex differences in the biomechanical properties of the iris
using a hybrid in vivo/ex vivo approach in rabbits (K99 mentored phase). SA2 - Investigate sex differences in
biomechanical properties of the human iris using in vivo and ex vivo (cadaver) analyses. SA3 - Investigate bio-
mechanical conditions required to induce AC and PB, and their relation to sex and history of AC (R00). These
studies will provide an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of PACG and a unique opportunity to
combine engineering, basic science, and clinical research to address a significant public health issue.
During the mentored phase, the applicant will learn multiple foundational techniques, including in vivo animal
studies in rabbits, biomechanical analysis of active (muscular) tissue, histology, OCT imaging, and human sub-
ject studies. In addition, he will significantly expand his professional training through various mechanisms. The
skills and techniques learned during the mentored phase will build on the applicant s background in tissue bio-
mechanics and allow him to pursue a successful and impactful independent academic career."
10906158,"Project Summary
The long-term objective of this project is to develop a revolutionary quantum mechanical solid-state
magnetometer designed to non-invasively detect femtoTesla (fT) scale magnetic fields derived from the brain’s
electrical activities during natural human experiences. The project has been designed to address the vision of
the NIH Brain Initiative: Transformative Brain Non-invasive Imaging Technology Development. The core
component of the magnetometer is a quantum-based magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), a nanoscale sensing
device with potentially unprecedented sensitivity and performance. Through a series of steps and
interdisciplinary collaboration, this project is expected to increase the sensitivity of the current MTJs by several
orders of magnitude and to develop triaxial MTJ sensors capable of recording the brain's magnetic fields with
the highest information density. Once the desired sensitivity is achieved, the project will build a whole-head
300-channel magnetoencephalographic (MEG) system based on MTJs, which can operate fully untethered,
without the need for an expensive magnetically shielded room or nulling coils. By design, the sensors will be
immune to natural head motion, further enabling the system to function in natural environment. The project will
address several challenges in designing and producing sensors that can detect magnetic fields as low as 50
fT. First, the project will improve the detectability of current prototype sensors by several orders of magnitude
by using a series of innovative approaches in sensor design, atomic engineering, fabrication, and noise
reduction. Second, the project will design and package triaxial sensors that can simultaneously measure
tangential and radial magnetic fields. Third, the project will reduce the size of the sensors by more than five
times compared to other technologies, so that more sensors can be implemented on a full-head helmet to
improve spatial resolution and localization. Finally, and importantly, the project will increase the field dynamic
range of the sensors over the technologies based on OPM (optically pumped magnetometer) and SQUID
(superconducting quantum interference device), so that the MTJ-MEG system can operate without the need of
magnetic shielding to allow real-world applications. Once these groundbreaking MTJ sensors are developed,
the project will integrate the MTJ-MEG system architecture and make it available for verifying performance
versus competing technologies. The project will use the MTJ-MEG system to assess brain related signals
during sensory stimulation, cognitive processing, and motor actions. If successful, this project will develop a
transformative MTJ-MEG system with unpresented levels of performance to produce a dynamic picture of the
brain under natural settings covering the whole lifespan."
10873873,"The goal of this K23 application is to provide Dr. Bishara with the necessary research experience and
time to establish himself as a primary investigator focused on designing and implementing machine learning
(ML) and artificial intelligence in the perioperative setting. The career development activities in this application
include early intensive course work in ML and statistics focused on improving model development and causal
inference techniques. Then coursework focuses on clinical trial training, grantsmanship, responsible conduct of
research, and culminates in a course studying implementation science and algorithmic human-robot interaction.
Augmenting this training are project-specific tutorials with experts to improve the models proposed in this
application with a focus on real-time prediction of perioperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and describing the risk
landscape of perioperative AKI. To achieve these goals, Dr. Bishara has assembled a team of experts and
mentors in the areas of data science, AKI, ML, and statistics. Dr. Atul Butte, his primary mentor, is an expert in
data science and ML and has trained nearly 100 post-doctoral fellows, undergraduate and graduate students,
and staff. Dr. Kathleen Liu is a thought leader in the field of AKI with an active research program focused on AKI
and critical care clinical trials. She has mentored numerous junior faculty, including previous NIH K23 awardees.
Dr. Romain Pirracchio is an expert in biostatistics and ML in acute care. He has collaborations with Berkeley and
the FDA and over 100 publications in the realm. These three mentors and the impressive team of advisors will
guide Dr. Bishara to complete the project described below and to grow into an independent investigator.
 There has been a recent surge in the published literature on ML in medicine, and studies have shown
patient care improves when provider expertise is augmented by ML. Unfortunately, implementing published ML
models to inform clinical care is not trivial, as many obstacles exist. This application focuses on exploring and
overcoming those obstacles by implementing specific models in the perioperative setting. Dr. Bishara has
developed novel ML visualization technology that allows for improved interactions between providers and
models, which provide predictions and recommendations to those providers. This technology also allows for
improved regular monitoring and interpretation of the model to assure sustained accuracy and reliability. He will
apply this new technology to predict perioperative AKI in real-time, building upon models he has developed.
Postoperative AKI is a major public health problem affecting up to 47% of patients and is consistently associated
with adverse outcomes, including, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), increased healthcare costs,
and death. Randomized controlled trials show that implementation of kidney-protective strategies prevents AKI
for high-risk patients. Evidence suggests these strategies are underutilized as risk of AKI is often underestimated
in the perioperative setting. Dr. Bishara hypothesizes his ML models will identify those patients who will most
benefit from timely kidney protective interventions at the time when preventative strategies can be initiated."

The overall goal of this research and training plan is to define the molecular mechanisms underlying
tauopathies in diverse populations. Currently, the contribution of specific MAPT mutations to tau toxicity, the
mechanisms by which tauopathies occur, and the contribution of different genetic backgrounds to these
mechanisms remain poorly understood. This project aims to define druggable molecular signatures of MAPT
mutations using stem cell models from African (Nigeria), Asian (Japan), and South American (Brazil)
populations.
The investigator, Dr. Miguel Minaya, will gain advanced training in stem cell biology and functional genomics in
support of an innovative approach that establishes novel cell models that use human induced pluripotent stem
cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, diverse populations, and CRISPR-based screens to study the extent to which
MAPT mutations occurring in diverse genetic backgrounds will produce common and/or unique molecular
signatures of disease. The mentors who were selected for this training, Drs. Celeste Karch, Carlos Cruchaga,
and Martin Kampmann, are internationally recognized experts in the fields of tau biology, human and molecular
genetics, stem cell biology, genome editing, and functional genomic screens using CRISPRi.
The goal of this proposal is to define druggable molecular signatures of MAPT mutations using stem cell
models from diverse populations. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that MAPT mutations
occurring in diverse genetic backgrounds will produce common molecular signatures of disease. To define
these common mechanisms, I will define molecular changes in iPSC-derived neurons from iPSC lines with
engineered MAPT mutations and will then functionally annotate those genes using CRISRPi screens. Through
this research and mentored training plan, Dr. Minaya will make fundamental contributions to our knowledge of
the mechanisms by which disruptions in the MAPT gene are associated with tauopathies and will establish new
experimental tools and approaches that will form the foundation for a career as an independent, translational
neuroscientist."
10883772,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chromosomal translocations involving Nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) are observed in approximately 5% of pediatric
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with resistance to therapy and poor outcome, with
approximately 35% 5 year overall survival. NUP98 rearrangements lead to expression of oncogenic chimeric
gene fusions involving the intrinsically disordered, N-terminal region of NUP98 and the C-terminal region of one
of over 30 identified partner genes. The partner genes commonly have domains with key functional properties,
including homeodomain moieties (e.g. HOXA9) and roles in transcriptional regulation (e.g. NSD1, KDM5A). In
complex with other machinery needed for gene regulation, NUP98 fusion oncoproteins (FOs) bind to the
promoters of many developmental genes. This leads to changes in chromatin structure, increased expression of
target genes, and aberrant hematopoietic self-renewal. Recent studies, including my own, have shown that the
ability of NUP98 FOs to localize within the nucleus in membrane-less organelles, or “puncta” formed through
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), is necessary for transformation and deregulated gene expression
phenotypes. Nevertheless, which proteins interact with NUP98 FOs in puncta and the importance of puncta
formation for effective therapeutic targeting of NUP98-rearranged cells is not known. This research proposal
seeks to identify the proteins found in NUP98 FO-associated puncta, uncover how puncta alter gene regulation,
and determine if puncta disruption correlates with effective treatment of NUP98-rearranged cells. Aim 1 will
examine the role of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex members, which my preliminary data identified as
key NUP98 FO interacting proteins, in NUP98::KDM5A FO-driven cell transformation. I will perform
CRISPR/Cas9 editing of HAT complex genes in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from our
Nup98::Kdm5a mouse model and study the in vitro and in vivo consequences of these alterations. I will also
examine gene expression and chromatin remodeling in Nup98::Kdm5a HSPCs with and without HAT complex
disruption. Aim 2 will determine whether effective therapeutic targeting of NUP98 FOs leads to puncta disruption.
I will perform co-localization experiments for FO with proteins involved in nuclear transport and gene regulation.
I will then pharmacologically inhibit these interacting proteins using available small molecule inhibitors and
assess changes in puncta features and cell viability over time to determine if puncta disruption correlates with
drug efficacy. In Aim 3, I will identify interacting proteins that are vulnerabilities in NUP98-rearranged cells and
use pharmacologic inhibition of crucial interactors to identify how they are involved in cell transformation, gene
regulation, and LLPS. Together, these studies will identify critical interacting proteins in leukemias bearing
NUP98 gene fusions, examine how they contribute to leukemogenesis, and uncover how they might be targeted
for therapeutic benefit."
10914972,"Project Summary/Abstract
The primary objectives of the Deep South RCMAR Community Liaison and Recruitment Core (CLRC) are
to 1) educate, train, and mentor Scientists in community-engaged theory-based approaches to engaging older
Black/African Americans (B/AAs) in health-related intervention research, 2) assist RCMAR Scientists in
recruiting older AAs into their research studies, and 3) build a sustainable infrastructure that will generate and
disseminate new knowledge regarding the science of recruitment and retention. Our approach to recruitment
and retention draws upon research that addresses the role of culture in promoting health among older AAs.
There are cohort differences between younger and older AAs because of greater institutional policies of racism
and discrimination experienced by minority elders. Consequently, for health information, older AAs rely, to a
greater extent, on their minority segregated communities, their cultural values, and their kinship systems. In
addition to family and extended kinship networks, older AAs place high value on their religious beliefs and
practices. Because of this, recruitment and retention endeavors should reflect this rich cultural fabric and
employ community engagement strategies that are theory-based and culturally relevant.
In this application, we build upon our existing community-based infrastructure that has fostered community
capacity for active engagement in clinical research and has served as a catalyst to increase participation of
older AAs in health-related intervention research studies. Through the activities of the CLRC, we expect that
RCMAR Scientists will continue to have access to evidence-based recruitment and retention tools for both
urban and rural older AAs, and realize enhanced participation of older AAs, greater community “buy-in” to
research projects, and clearer routes of dissemination and intervention sustainability. Our CLRC has
successfully engaged rural and urban communities via broad-based efforts aimed directly at individuals, as
well as organizational conduits such as community-based groups and agents of change. We envision
continued mutually beneficial engagement fostering opportunities both for the CLRC and RCMAR Scientists to
solicit community input on the development of potential research questions and for community members to
enjoy enhanced access to state-of-the-art clinical research focused on older AAs.
To accomplish these broader goals, we propose the following specific aims for the Community Liaison and
Recruitment Core of the Deep South RCMAR:
1. Work collaboratively with the Research Education Component (REC) to educate, train, and mentor
 RCMAR Scientists regarding the theory and approach to community engagement and assist
 RCMAR Scientists in recruiting older AAs to their research studies
2. Advance scientific knowledge in recruitment and retention of older urban and rural AAs by
 empirically testing recruitment and retention strategies developed in partnership with community
members
3. Expand capacity for community-academic partnerships by providing health education seminars
 and grant-related education for community partners. Many community partners are interested in
 securing small funds to support their community-related projects.
4. Disseminate research findings to the scientific community and the communities we serve."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) disproportionately impact Hispanic Americans,
who exhibit AD/ADRD rates 1.5 times higher and average onset 7 years earlier than do older Whites. Predicted
growth of the US Hispanic population, faster in Texas portends exacerbation of the elevated health and
economic burdens of AD/ADRD in Hispanics. A shortage of researchers focused on AD/ADRD in Hispanic
Americans, particularly from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, restricts progress in this area, and is a key
factor contributing to the severe underrepresentation of Hispanic Americans in research studies in AD/ADRD.
To overcome these barriers, responding to NIA's AD/ADRD RCMAR Program (RFA-AG-23-025), and
leveraging the robust mentorship and research infrastructure our RCMAR developed during the first 5-yr
funding cycle, we aim to continue the Rio Grande Valley AD/ADRD RCMAR: Partnership for Progress at the
University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), one of the nation's largest Hispanic-serving institutions. We
will combine evidence-based mentoring and support mechanisms to develop and promote a first-rate regional
and national cadre of researchers from underrepresented groups, to analyze the complex mechanisms and
interacting factors that contribute to disparate Hispanic AD/ADRD vulnerability. The Center will support
development of social and behavioral interventions using the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention
Development, considering pathways and developmental time points at which changes in social circumstances
and behavior can exert the largest favorable impacts on the prevention and progression of AD/ADRD among
Hispanic populations. The Center will also exploit its unique resources to develop infrastructure and data
collections that will attract and support researchers from multiple disciplines to conduct research aimed at
reducing impacts of AD/ADRD on Hispanics. UTRGV's socio-demographic profile reflects that of its local
community, positioning it uniquely to advance studies of disparities in health & health care and contribute
innovative solutions to improve minorities' health. To achieve the Center's goals, the aims are: 1) Identify,
engage, mentor, and provide high-quality training and individualized career development support to
outstanding faculty, especially from underrepresented groups; 2) Support innovative, high-impact
multidisciplinary pilot projects; 3) Continue providing expertise and resources for culturally-sensitive measures
& analysis of cognitive risk factors in older Hispanics, including behavioral, neuropsychological, neuroimaging,
cardiovascular, and genetic traits; and 4) Create needed expertise & resources to develop social/behavioral
interventions at different ecological levels, via sustained community engagement of older Hispanics and their
care partners in South TX. We will achieve these aims by continuation of 3 Cores (Leadership & Admin.,
Analysis, Community Liaison/Recruitment) and the Research Education Component. The Center will also
leverage & build upon experience of collaborators at the UTRGV Institute of Neuroscience and the South TX
Diabetes & Obesity Institute, and NIA-South Texas AD Research Center."

Sudden and Unexpected Infant Deaths (SUID), which include Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and
unintentional injury-related infant deaths, remains a leading cause of US postneonatal mortality, with ~3400
deaths/year. Many SUIDs are preventable with greater adherence to safe infant sleep guidelines. There are
racial and socioeconomic disparities in adherence to these guidelines and in SUID rates. We conducted the
successful Social Media and Risk-Reduction Training for Infant Care Practices (SMART; 1R01HD072815)
study in which 1600 mothers at 16 US birth hospitals were randomized to receive short educational videos,
delivered by email or text message, focused on safe sleep (TodaysBabyTM) vs. control, in the first 2 months
after birth. Compared to mothers receiving attention-matched control messages, those receiving this
intervention had ~10 percentage point higher rates of following safe sleep practices. Importantly, racial and
socioeconomic disparities in safe sleep practices were eliminated among the study population. Given that we
have demonstrated effectiveness in the SMART intervention, we now propose GET SMART (Get Social Media
and Risk-Reduction Training), a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness cluster randomized trial of 20
hospitals to determine optimal strategies to implement this intervention in real-world conditions. We will
compare the “high touch” (HT) implementation strategy used in SMART (hospital staff introduced the program,
obtained informed consent, watched 2 videos with them) with a “low touch” (LT, i.e., less resource-intensive)
strategy, which will leverage social marketing techniques in a direct-to-consumer approach to reach mothers
during the postpartum hospitalization through QR codes easily visible in the hospital environment that mothers
will use to sign up for the TodaysBabyTM program. Given the disparities in SUID and safe sleep practices, GET
SMART will occur in hospitals serving predominantly low-income populations in counties with >1.5 times the
national SUID rate. We will use the Proctor Conceptual Model of Implementation Research to inform our
implementation strategies and outcomes. We will compare the impact of the hospital-based HT and LT
strategies with regards to differences in penetration (proportion of eligible mothers who sign up for
TodaysBabyTM), equity of penetration according to income and race/ethnicity, and the program cost per mother
sign up. Secondary implementation outcomes will be feasibility, acceptability, sustainability; and fidelity to the
intervention (number of videos watched). Effectiveness outcomes will be adherence to 4 safe sleep practices
(sleep position, sleep location, nonuse of soft bedding, pacifier use) after the 2-month intervention. After
completion of this implementation-effectiveness study, we will be able to generate valuable policy-relevant data
for an easily replicated mobile-delivered video safe sleep intervention needed for decision-making by public
health organizations and health care systems to inform broad scalability among groups with historically high
rates of SUID."
10867418,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 80-85% of primary liver cancers, and mainly occurs in patients
with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Prognosis of HCC is dismal primarily due to
advanced stage of disease at diagnosis. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend HCC surveillance by
biannual liver ultrasound with/without serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for at-risk patients to achieve the goal of
detecting HCC at a curative stage. However, their accuracy remains relevantly low with sensitivity between 60-
70% at a specificity of 90%. As such, novel biomarkers for early detection of HCC are still desperately needed.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous group of lipid nanoparticles that are released by all types of
cells, and even more so by tumor cells and those cells within tumor microenvironment. Tumor-associated EVs
are present in circulation at relatively early stages of disease and are readily accessible across all disease stages.
Since the surface proteins of tumor-associated EVs could mirror those of the parental tumor cells and those cells
within tumor microenvironment, exploiting the diagnostic potential of HCC-associated EVs’ surface protein
signatures as a novel biomarker for early detection of HCC holds great promise to significantly augment the
ability of current diagnostic modalities.
We propose an HCC EV Surface Protein Assay (SPA) to quantify subpopulations of HCC-associated EVs for
detecting early-stage HCC. The proposed HCC EV SPA couples two powerful technologies: Click Chemistry-
mediated EV Click Beads for isolating different subsets of HCC-associated EVs, and downstream 4-plex real-
time immuno-PCR for quantification of the isolated subsets of HCC EVs. One of the major challenges emerging
in the field of EV utilization for clinical use is the lack of robust and reproducible methods for the isolation of
subpopulations of tumor-associated EVs. Conventional methods for isolating EVs, such as ultracentrifugation,
filtration, and precipitation, are incapable of isolating subpopulation of tumor-associated EVs from total EVs. New
research efforts have been devoted to exploring immunoaffinity-based capture techniques for enriching tumor-
associated EVs from the plasma samples of patients with different solid tumors. However, there are challenges
identified for the single antibody-mediated tumor-derived EV enriching approaches, such as limited
sensitivity/specificity and a need for multiple capture antibodies to overcome the tumor heterogeneity. In order
to address these concerns, our research team developed HCC EV SPA, which combines a click chemistry-
mediated tumor-associated EV isolation, and downstream 4-plex real-time immuno-PCR. HCC EV SPA is
capable of highly sensitive and specific quantification of 32 subpopulations of HCC EVs in patients’ plasma
samples, based on the combined use of 8 different HCC-associated surface protein markers and four EV surface
markers. The long-term goal of this R01 proposal is to develop, refine, and validate the HCC EV SPA for
detecting early-stage HCC from at-risk liver cirrhotic patients by quantifying subpopulations of HCC EVs."
10909368,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Individual neurons within the visual cortex exhibit variable responses when repeatedly presented with the same
stimulus, and these fluctuations predict whether or not a faint target will be detected. In the prior round of funding,
this team discovered that “intrinsic traveling waves” (iTWs) occur spontaneously in visual area MT of the awake
marmoset. Previous studies had observed iTWs, but since the animals were anesthetized, it remained unknown
(1) if iTWs occur in awake animals and (2) what role, if any, iTWs play in perception. The team found that iTWs
create periods of both elevated and suppressed spiking activity. They also found that iTWs conjointly modulate
both stimulus-evoked spiking responses and perceptual sensitivity in a visual detection task. A large-scale
spiking network model developed by the team predicts that iTWs are a result of the time delays from axonal
conduction along the long-range horizontal fibers common across visual areas. These results raise the possibility
that iTWs are a new, dynamic mechanism of gain control. In this competitive renewal, this experiment- and
theory-driven team is well positioned to conduct experiments to test this role for iTWs by uncovering their
connection to specific patterns of connectivity in the visual system. This work will progress in three Specific
Aims. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that iTWs fall into distinct motifs that regulate neural response gain and
perception in a feature-selective manner. The team’s network model predicts that clustered, feature-specific
connectivity among cortical columns in area MT will create iTWs that traverse subnetworks of like-tuned neurons.
They will test this theory-driven prediction in recordings from Area MT. Aim 2: Test the prediction that iTWs vary
in their impact and timing across layers of the cortical column. Using combined laminar and ECoG array
recordings, they will examine the impact of iTWs in the supragranular, granular, and infragranular layers of area
MT. Aim 3: Test competing published models of iTWs that make opposite predictions about their role in behavior.
One class of models predicts that iTWs drive pairwise correlations in ongoing undriven activity (so-called “noise
correlations”), which impair sensory discrimination. iTWs are thus, according to these models, a source of
information-limiting correlations that need to be diminished to improve sensory processing. The model of iTWs
developed by this team predicts, instead, that iTWs make no measurable contribution to pairwise correlations in
undriven activity and that they improve sensory processing by regulating the gain of sensory evoked responses,
an effect analogous to the benefits that stem from attention-dependent regulation of gain. Taken together, the
proposed experiments will elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying iTWs and probe their roles in both
detection and discrimination of stimuli. In addition, these experiments will test a new hypothesis about the role
of long-range horizontal fibers that link similarly tuned neural populations. This team will test if these pathways,
which are themselves sculpted by the natural statistics of the visual environment, guide iTWs and in so doing
provide a novel means of selectively sampling visual features that are typically found in the environment."
10894314,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ongoing evaluation of cost-benefit tradeoffs guides action selection during adaptive decision making. When
outcomes change, the utility of potential actions is re-evaluated to determine whether to persist or deviate from
an existing strategy. Disturbances in the neural mechanisms underlying cost-benefit decision making can lead
to pathological behavior (e.g., addiction, OCD, depression/anxiety). Effort-based decision making is specifically
disrupted in patients with depression, schizophrenia and substance use disorders. Although pathological
behavior in these conditions is linked to dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, we lack the detailed
neurobiological understanding necessary to design targeted therapeutic interventions. We will address this deficit
using cutting edge tools for measuring and manipulating neural activity in freely behaving animals. We will test
the specific hypothesis that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) projection neurons
encode updates to action selection policies based on new effort-reward tradeoffs, and that inputs to the NAc
instantiate new, effortful choice strategies. In Aim 1, we will use miniaturized head-mounted microscopes to
determine how ACC and ACCàNAc projection neuron activity is organized to represent effort-related cost-
benefit computations influencing action selection. In Aim 2, we will manipulate the activity of ACCàNAc
projection neurons with optogenetics, during flexible decision making driven by changes in effort-related value.
Finally, in Aim 3, we will focus on prefrontal projections to the NAc, measuring and inhibiting activity at ACCàNAc
terminals and comparing with inputs from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We will do this during decision making
in the context of both effort and delay-costs as a tool to further refine our understanding of how NAc integrates
prefrontal inputs and translates these into action selection. This proposal directly addresses a pressing need to
understand the cell-type and circuit-specific mechanisms that mediate cost-benefit decision making. Our
research can inform pharmacological, psychotherapeutic and brain stimulation interventions for a variety of
psychiatric conditions characterized by disordered cost-benefit evaluations and decision making."
10899669,"Cellular mechanisms of state-dependent processing in visual cortex
Current understanding of neuronal mechanisms mediating processing of visual information and visual perception is largely
based on results from experiments on either anesthetized or awake and attentive brains. However, these two states represent
two extremes on a continuum of states of alertness, and it is known that both humans and animals perceive and respond to
stimuli when non-attentive, nonalert and even during light sleep. Indeed, recent studies in awake mice and rabbits revealed
that transitions between alert and nonalert states dramatically change the operation of thalamic and cortical neurons along
the visual pathway. However, we have a limited knowledge of changes of synaptic inputs, receptive fields and response
properties of different types of cortical neurons over a broad range of states, the cellular mechanisms that drive these state-
dependent changes, and how these state-dependent changes affect cortical processing of visual information. To address
these gaps in our knowledge, we will exploit advantages of the visual system of rabbit, an experimental animal that can sit
quietly for hours and exhibits very limited eye movements while spontaneously and naturally transitioning between alert,
nonalert/drowsy and sleep states. We will make intracellular recordings from visual cortex (V1) neurons and extracellular
recordings from neurons in the visual thalamus (LGN) in retinotopically aligned regions, in chronic experiments, while
drug-free subjects transition between different brain states. We will (a) identify different types of cortical projection neurons
and interneurons in different cortical layers electrophysiologically and using antidromic and ortodromic microstimulation
in different brain structures; (b) characterize their receptive fields and response properties using a battery of visual stimuli;
(c) assess the contribution of excitation and inhibition in neuronal responses, and characterize single-unit computations by
analyzing the transformation of subthreshold activity into spike trains during responses to visual stimuli and injection of
fluctuating currents; (d) rigorously quantify each brain state and transition between them using their characteristic signatures
in the EEG recorded in the hippocampus and neocortex. These experiments will provide unique data on how thalamic inputs,
visual responses and receptive fields in cortical neurons of different types change over a broad range of brain states, and
investigate mechanisms of this state-dependence in terms of changes of synaptic inputs, single-unit computations, and
excitation/inhibition balance. Results of the proposed research will help to achieve the next level of understanding of how
brain state affects visual processing and visual perception.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 1,550 people are killed and over 71,000 are
injured each year in accidents caused by decreased attention and drowsiness. The proposed work will lead to a better
understanding of state-dependence of visual processing and will inform further research and development of tools for
detection of decreased attention and prevention of ""drowsy driving"" accidents. It will also inform further research into
cognitive disorders associated with deficits in perception caused by impaired attention and/or dysfunction of mechanisms
regulating wake-sleep cycle."

Sleep is essential to our well-being, yet sleep problems are pervasive across mental health disorders and are

the longitudinal course of sleep neurophysiology, brain maturation, emotion reactivity, and memory
generalization and their relation to emotional health from the onset of adolescence through mid-late
adolescence to inform novel treatments and minimize emotional health risks during this critical developmental
window. In our ongoing R01, we have focused on mechanisms related to negative overgeneralization – a core
dimension of anxiety that is poorly understood. We have found that sleep fails to depotentiate the response of
the amygdala to negative stimuli in participants with elevated anxiety and negative overgeneralization emerges
from an interplay between the amygdala at encoding and pattern completion supported by activity in the CA1
subfield of the hippocampus during retrieval. This proposal builds on and extends our ongoing R01 by
longitudinally following the same individuals to investigate our hypothesis that altered emotional reactivity,
sleep neurophysiology, and overgeneralization of negative memories arise from an imbalance between the
amygdala and the hippocampus. Further, we posit that the amygdalo-hippocampal imbalance, exacerbated by
the emotional and social changes prevalent during adolescence, contributes to the escalation of internalizing
symptom severity often noted during this developmental window. The current renewal proposal tests this
model using an accelerated longitudinal approach combining multiple methods – detailed clinical assessment,
neuroimaging, polysomnography, and emotional memory task – across three time points, collected every ~18
months, in each participant to examine longitudinal maturation from peri-adolescence through mid-late
adolescence. Youth (retained: n=140; newly recruited: n=80; total: N=220) across a continuum of anxiety
symptoms, assigned to one of four cohorts based on their age at baseline will be enrolled in the proposed
renewal study. Aim 1 will utilize the nocturnal polysomnography and structural and functional neuroimaging
data collected at baseline and the two follow-up sessions to evaluate the longitudinal relation between
amygdalo-hippocampal function and changes in sleep. Aim 2 will focus on behavior from the emotional
memory task and functional neuroimaging data collected across waves to evaluate the longitudinal relation
between amygdalo-hippocampal function and changes in negative overgeneralization. Aim 3 will incorporate
the detailed clinical assessments collected across waves to investigate the longitudinal relation between
amygdalo-hippocampal function, sleep neurophysiology, negative overgeneralization, and internalizing
symptom severity. This project will provide critically needed data to advance mechanistic understanding of how
sleep and neuromaturation influence emotional health in this sensitive period."
10739312,"DEVELOPMENTAL CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the Developmental Core (DC) of the Southern California Center for Children’s Environmental
Health Translational Research (SC-CCEHTR) is (1) to nurture and mentor junior investigators developing new
translational research strategies and approaches to children’s environmental health science (CEHS), and (2) to
develop a Catalyst Project Program addressing time-sensitive or emerging challenges in CEHS and testing novel
multidisciplinary translational approaches to identify the causes and reduce the burden of environmental disease.
A Career Development Program (CDP) will develop CEHS expertise and identify and promote training
opportunities that are concordant with the Center theme of Urbanism, Air Pollution, Children’s Health and
Environmental Justice. The CDP will distinguish itself by promoting integration across diverse fields largely
new to CEHS, including communication, policy and urban design, sociology, dramatic arts, education, network
analysis and implementation science, among others; and traditional CEHS population sciences. Junior
investigators will be supported by Catalyst Program pilot project funds with a goal of increasing CEHS
translational impact, productivity, competitiveness for peer-reviewed external funding in CEHS, and progress to
research independence. An innovative CD Seminar, a forum for mentoring, especially peer mentoring,
information exchange and development of new interdisciplinary translational teams, will help promote integration
across disciplines. Center enrichment activities, including Center seminar series, workshops, associated visiting
scientist symposia, Focus Area working groups, yearly Center retreats, and travel support will all have a focus
on junior investigators’ CD. An innovative partnership with the International Society for Children’s Health and the
Environment (ISCHE) will expand the reach of the CDP. ISCHE will train junior investigator “Fellows” in policy,
science communication and community science. The Center will support travel of approximately 10 ISCHE
Fellows and participants in the SC-CCEHTR CDP who are ISCHE members to an ISCHE Retreat in Years 3 and
5. Fostering interactions with junior investigators from other institutions regionally and across the country will be
a Center priority. External investigators from ISCHE, other Children's Environmental Health Research
Translation Centers, and other partners will have priority for the Catalyst Program pilot projects and Center CD
resources in order to promote mutually beneficial collaboration. The DC will also leverage a broad spectrum of
training opportunities developed across three other NIEHS-funded centers at USC, focused on CEHS, that have
a track record of successfully mentoring junior faculty to independence and tenure-track faculty positions. The
DC will be a model for promoting better understanding of CEHS that leads to reduced air pollution exposure and
healthier communities."
10739314,"TRANSLATION CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Translation Core (TC) supports the mission of Southern California Center for Children’s Environmental
Health Translational Research (SC-CCEHTR) to leverage the existing scientific knowledge base to build diverse
interdisciplinary teams and foster multidirectional stakeholder engagement. In addition to traditional children’s
environmental health scientists, the TC brings together experts in communication, policy, dramatic arts, urban
planning, land-use design, implementation science and program evaluation around the Center’s theme of
Urbanism, Air Pollution, Children’s Health and Environmental Justice. The Translation Core will draw on
the Center’s extensive scientific base from which to build diverse interdisciplinary teams and community
partnerships around three Focus Areas: 1) Youth Engagement & Community Science; 2) Urban Design & Policy
Solutions and 3) Communication & Public Knowledge. These are needed to translate research effectively and
reduce the burden of air pollution-related disease, disability and environmental health disparities in children. The
overarching goals of the TC are to increase environmental health literacy among the public and policymakers to
inform action to protect children’s environmental health; collaboratively develop and disseminate key research
findings to local and national audiences through innovative journalism; build knowledge and capacity of urban
environmental justice communities to leverage scientific studies and resources; and provide tools and strategies
to eliminate, reduce or mitigate adverse environmental exposures. A robust evaluation mechanism leveraging
multidisciplinary expertise in communication, network analysis, and implementation science will assess efficacy
and provide a strong basis for scholarship. The TC will build upon two decades of experience at the intersection
of air pollution, children’s health and translation that has resulted in successful models to engage communities
and decision-makers to address environmental health disparities related to traffic and goods movement in
Southern California. Investigators have collaboratively created models to democratize the use of scientific
information as a tool for action at the community and policy level. The TC will use this experience to develop and
integrate novel methods to train residents, youth, and policymakers in air pollution science, collaborate with
multiple stakeholders implementing an effort to assess and reduce toxic air emissions at a neighborhood scale,
and expand our engagement program to include storytelling, participatory urban planning and theatre. In
addition, we will leverage traditional and nontraditional communications techniques such as social media,
geographically targeted email, newsletters and infographics to update stakeholders on current science and
engage the power of communities to reduce environmental health burdens through policy change."

Poverty affects over 37 million individuals in the U.S., subjecting them to syndemics – clustered, mutually enhancing
epidemics such as obesity, diabetes, and depression that arise from and perpetuate socioeconomic inequality. Syndemic
theory underscores a pathway to mitigate syndemics by intervening on a single target within the cluster. Obesity’s high
prevalence in poverty; role in increasing leading causes of death (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia); and
adverse psychosocial effects (e.g., increased depression) make it a crucial, high priority target. While structural and social
factors contribute to obesity in poverty, research shows the effectiveness of individual-level interventions in improving
health behaviors and weight when highly responsive to overburdened populations’ needs. At the same time, evidence
guiding refinement of interventions is sparse as participants with socioeconomic disadvantage are underrepresented in
obesity treatment research. Reflecting this phenomenon, Rx Weight Loss, a fully automated online obesity treatment, has
seen limited use among patients with low income despite past work showing it can be delivered effectively through
primary care at low cost. Since 72.8% of adults in poverty have a usual primary care provider, and 83% have Internet
access, this gap in adoption represents a significant opportunity for public health impact through adaptation of RxWL that
increases relevance for traditionally underserved populations. Further, this research is poised to fill a critical gap in
obesity treatment literature. Thus, this application aims to revise RxWL content and the process by which primary care
providers refer patients to the program (referenced collectively as the “RxWL package”) to maximize responsiveness,
reach, and effectiveness for those in poverty. Using mixed methods data collection, this project structures research
activities using the Social Marketing Assessment and Response Tool (SMART) and examines implementation outcomes
identified by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Primary care provider (n = 23) and
patient (n = 16) stakeholders will provide feedback on the existing RxWL package (Aim 1); insights and scientific
knowledge will be integrated to produce a low-cost RxWL package prototype (i.e., a PDF with embedded links
approximating the intended program) for usability testing (n = 8 providers, 10 patients; Aim 2); and data will drive
development of a finalized RxWL package to disseminate through primary care and evaluate in an open trial (n = 12
providers, 32 patients; Aim 3). Aim 3 will examine both implementation and preliminary clinical outcomes, including
effects on weight loss and syndemic sequelae; obtain insights for further refinement; and indicate readiness for a larger R-
funded clinical trial. Revising RxWL holds high potential to reduce health disparities for those from socioeconomically
disadvantaged backgrounds. Moreover, findings will make significant contributions to the literature on recruitment and
retention of patients in poverty in obesity treatment research; adaptation of obesity treatment to fit the unique needs of
traditionally underserved populations; and impact of social determinants of health on the course of obesity treatment."

The cerebellum controls behaviors that depend on prediction, including motor learning, eye movements,
balance, and cognitive-affective functions. The cerebellar cortex transforms mossy fiber (MF) inputs into
Purkinje cell (PC) outputs. It is vital to delineate the elements of this circuit and their connectivity to relate
circuit properties to function and disease. To improve our understanding of transformations in the cerebellar
cortex, this proposal seeks to delineate the circuit properties of the most abundant type of interneuron in the
cerebellum, the molecular layer interneuron (MLI). MLIs inhibit PCs and other MLIs to control the output of the
cerebellar cortex. However, single nucleus RNA sequencing recently identified two molecularly distinct types of
MLIs, MLI type 1 (MLI1) and MLI type 2 (MLI2). Intriguingly, MLI1s express connexin 36, whereas MLI2s do
not. This suggests that MLI1s might be gap junction coupled with each other, which could promote
synchronous firing and make MLI1s well-suited to controlling the timing of PC outputs. The circuit properties of
MLI1 and MLI2 are not known. Here I will clarify MLI1 and MLI2 connectivity using slice electrophysiology and
serial electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions in mice. The first aim of this proposal is to determine the
outputs of MLI1 and MLI2 using paired whole-cell recordings in brain slice. First, I will characterize MLI1 and
MLI2 synaptic connections onto PCs. I will also characterize the contributions of MLI1 and MLI2 to ephaptic
inhibition, which arises from large extracellular signals near MLI specializations known as pinceaux that
surround PC axon initial segments. Lastly, I will characterize synaptic connections and electrical coupling
between MLI1 and MLI2. The second aim of this proposal is to characterize the ultrastructural circuit
specializations of MLI1 and MLI2 and generate a comprehensive map of MLI1 and MLI2 synaptic and ephaptic
connectivity using large-scale EM reconstructions. The complementary approaches of electrophysiological
characterization and EM reconstructions will provide a complete picture of the functional properties and the
anatomical connectivity. Preliminary findings suggest that MLI1 and MLI2 target different cells, with MLI1s
mainly inhibiting PCs, whereas MLI2s primarily inhibit other MLIs. Based on these preliminary studies, my
working model is that MLI1s are well suited to controlling the timing of PC outputs, whereas MLI2s promote PC
excitability by disinhibiting PCs. Completion of the proposed work will define the properties of these circuit
elements, and if preliminary results are confirmed, it will be necessary to revise the circuit diagram of the
cerebellar cortex. These experiments will also lead to future studies that will determine the in vivo firing
properties of MLI1 and MLI2 and determine how MLI1 and MLI2 contribute to processing, learning and
behavior. These studies promise to shed light on mechanisms of cerebellar computations that are relevant to
neurological disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases."
10875436,"ABSTRACT
Obesity is a critical public health problem associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Binge eating
(BE), a compulsive episodic overeating behavior, is associated with increased rates of obesity and weight gain.
Despite the negative impact of BE on physiological health and obesity risk, the underlying neural mechanisms
contributing to BE are largely unknown. Loss of control (LOC) over eating - i.e., being unable to control the
quantity of food consumed - is a core feature of BE and a significant predictor of obesity. However, there have
been no mechanistic investigations of in vivo neural activity patterns underlying LOC during BE, limiting
development of new treatments. LOC is associated with difficulties disengaging from eating (i.e., feeding
offset), and pre-clinical models are an optimal system to precisely measure this behavioral event. In this set of
integrated training and scientific Aims, the candidate will identify neural correlates of feeding offset using an
animal model for BE to understand the underlying neural substrates of LOC. Data in mice show that activity in
dorsolateral striatum (DLS), a key region associated with behavior cessation, is blunted at feeding offset after
chronic BE. Preliminary data also suggest that activity in secondary motor cortex (M2) to DLS projecting cells
is reduced prior to feeding offset. This project will examine the role of DLS and M2 to DLS projecting cells in
feeding offset using a robust behavioral paradigm for binge eating in mice. The overarching hypotheses are: 1)
D1 and D2 spiny projection neurons in DLS will differentially contribute to feeding offset in BE vs. non-BE mice;
2) reversing blunted DLS activity in BE mice via closed-loop stimulation will improve pathologic behavior; 3)
specific ensembles of M2 to DLS projecting cells tuned to feeding offset will be less active in BE mice; and 4)
increasing activity of M2 to DLS specific neurons will improve maladaptive feeding behavior. Cellular resolution
in vivo calcium imaging will be used to identify neural activity patterns in specific DLS cell populations during
feeding offset (Aim 1). Closed-loop optogenetics will be used determine whether manipulation of neural activity
in DLS cell populations facilitates changes in feeding offset (Aim 2). Finally, in vivo calcium imaging and
optogenetics will be used to identify, track, and manipulate M2 to DLS projecting cells at feeding offset in BE
and non-BE mice to investigate a potential cortical treatment target for non-invasive treatment of BE (Aim 3).
The integrated training plan will ensure the candidate achieves her career goal of developing an independent
program in translational BE and obesity research. The candidate will expand her training in 4 core areas: 1)
learn cellular resolution in vivo calcium imaging; 2) develop statistical analysis skills applicable to complex
neural data aligned to behavioral events; 3) apply circuit manipulation techniques to inform future treatment
interventions; and 4) refine measurement of novel BE behaviors to maximize translational impact. Completion
of this K08 will contribute to a program of research that will increase our understanding of how core circuits
underlying BE can be manipulated to minimize maladaptive feeding that contributes to obesity risk."

We hypothesize that drug trials, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have failed in humans because AD entails both
proteotoxicity (involving at least Aß and tau) AND microglial activity (clearly demonstrated by GWAS studies),
probably with hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines. Successful treatments will probably require drugs that
ameliorate proteotoxicity AND microglial hypersecretion of cytokines, rather than targeting levels of a single
protein or peptide. We propose that a phenotype-based screening approach is more likely to lead to overall
successful therapies for AD and aging related diseases in general. Although 5 drugs are approved to treat AD,
they only treat symptoms, not causes of AD, and it is widely agreed that the clinical significance of these drugs
is modest at best. An increasing number of pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the search for
treatments for AD. We therefore developed an innovative high-throughput drug screening platform and
conducted two unparalleled high-throughput drug-repurposing screens for their ability to protect against Aß
toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans as a model for the more general process of proteotoxicity in vivo. In
subsequent studies, the most protective drugs in C. elegans were then rescreened in microglia for their ability to
reduce cytokine release (primarily TNF-alpha and IL-6). These screens led us to prioritize approximately 50 FDA-
approved drugs that were protective in these phenotypic assays. The objective of the presently proposed studies
is to evaluate if treatment with these FDA-approved drugs (or drugs in similar categories) reduce the risk of AD.
We propose to use population-level administrative claims data collected from the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) to assess if FDA-approved drugs that are protective in a C. elegans model of AD also
lower the risk for AD and related dementia in humans. The proposed project is an observational retrospective
pharmaco-epidemiological case-control study. The team will use a cox proportional hazard regression to obtain
hazard ratios of AD associated with each prioritized FDA-approved drug. Data will be acquired from CMS to
cover 5 consecutive years and all models will be fitted and adjusted to the covariates. The end goal of the study
is to identify drugs to be repurposed to treat AD and related dementia and to accumulate strong epidemiological
evidence in addition to the existing evidence from the model organism C. elegans and cell culture studies.
This transdisciplinary research between aging biologists, geriatricians, and epidemiologists will yield data and
experience essential to launch the applicant’s subsequent research and independent research career. The
results of the proposed study will be further compared with data from other population health records and
incorporated into the design of a future clinical trial. The research will take place at the Icahn School of Medicine
at Mount Sinai, which has a leading Geriatrics Department and world experts in pharmaco- epidemiology."
10894754,"Regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy is a highly promising approach for controlling unwanted or pathogenic immune
responses in autoimmune disease, transplantation or in anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation following the
administration of biotherapeutics such as clotting factor VIII (FVIII) replacement therapy in hemophilia A. Lack of
specificity and limited persistence impedes clinical application of polyclonal Treg therapy, which can be surmounted
by expressing antibody-based synthetic receptors such as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or TCR fusion
construct (TRuC) to redirect antigen specificity. TRuCs utilize the internal signaling machinery of a TCR by
reconfiguring endogenous TCR-CD3 signaling to respond to antibody-based recognition. We recently showed in a
preclinical hemophilia A model of FVIII deficiency that engineering antigen specificity by TRuC expressing Tregs
delivers durable suppression of ADA responses by more faithfully mimicking the physiological TCR signaling of
endogenous Tregs. However, dual recognition by both the synthetic receptor and endogenous TCR can increase
the likelihood of off-target suppressive effects and lead to competition for extracellular expression and downstream
signaling mediators.
In this proposal, we will evaluate a novel synthetic hybrid receptor generated by replacing the α and β variable (V)
regions of the TCR with the VH and VL domains of a FVIII specific antibody (FVIII V-swapTCR). A single-step
CRISPR/Cas mediated integration of FVIII V-swapTCR into the TCRα constant (TRAC) locus should abolish
endogenous TCR expression, thus eliminating dual antigen specificity, while allowing for more precise control of
synthetic receptor expression. In Aim 1, we will establish the specificity, and functionality of TCR KO FVIII V-
swapTCR Tregs. We will extensively characterize the phenotype and molecular pathways utilized by TCR KO FVIII
V-swapTCR Tregs. Functional suppression by the single-specific engineered Tregs will be assessed in a model of
ADA formation to FVIII replacement therapy in hemophilia A. In Aim 2, we will explore an innovative single chain
immunocytokine to drive the selective proliferation of TCR KO FVIII V-swapTCR Tregs in vivo, thereby improving
durability of suppression. The results of this study will provide pre-clinical evidence for effective suppression of ADA
responses to biotherapeutics and enable rational therapeutic design and applicability to other immune disorders.
Validating the principles of TCR KO Vswap TCR will provide proof of principle and will be a first step in engineering
single-antigen specific “off the shelf” antigen specific TCR and MHCI KO FVIII V-swap Tregs to overcome
alloreactive barriers, contributing to our long-term goal to generate universally applicable Tregs from healthy donors."
10847455,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Apicomplexa phylum contains many parasites that infect and cause disease in humans and animals,
including the agents that cause malaria, toxoplasmosis, and babesiosis. Babesia is a tick-borne intracellular
parasite that causes severe to fatal diseases, with broadening geographic distribution because of climate change
and increasing suburban developments in forested areas. There is no vaccine against human babesiosis, and
the current therapies have limited efficacy. Considering the complex life cycle of Babesia species, their survival
depends on the precise control of their gene expression, which is mostly regulated post-transcriptionally (e.g.,
during protein synthesis). Babesia species have a unique, non-photosynthetic organelle named apicoplast,
derived from a secondary endosymbiotic event. In addition to having ribosomes in its cytoplasm and
mitochondria, the apicoplast contains its own ribosomes. Little is known about the structure of these ribosomes,
although they are thought to be highly simplified, with prokaryotic-like components. They are inhibited by
antibacterial drugs that have some limited antiparasitic activity. The absence of a molecular structure of any
apicoplast ribosomes limits the rational design of antibiotics with improved antiparasitic properties. In the first
aim of this research proposal, we will establish a Babesia divergens strain expressing an hemagglutinin (HA)-
tagged triose phosphate transporter on the outer membrane of the apicoplast. This strategy will allow the affinity
purification of a high-quality organelle preparation, followed by the purification of apicoplast ribosomes. In the
second aim, we will define the components of apicoplast ribosomes and determine their structure using cryo-
electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our goal is thus to elucidate the fundamental molecular machinery that
apicomplexan parasites use to synthesize proteins in the highly specialized apicoplast organelle. Our work will
lay the foundation for studies that interrogate these parasites' gene regulation mechanisms and help inspire the
design of better antiparasitic agents."

Research (AD-RCMAR) will attract and support researchers from multiple disciplines with the goal of reducing
health disparities in the Hispanic American population with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders
(AD/ADRD). The Leadership and Administrative Core (LAC) will be the central executive unit of the UTRGV
AD/ADRD-RCMAR, providing leadership and coordination/communication among all activities and Cores. The
LAC will also provide programmatic direction and oversight of functions, including regulatory compliance,

The number of people living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) is expected
to almost triple by 2050. In the US, Hispanic Americans will comprise an ever-larger fraction of this population,
as their numbers are increasing, and they have higher risk for and earlier onset of AD/ADRD. Despite much
effort and funding to focused on developing effective drug therapies, breakthroughs remain challenging. An
urgent need persists to develop efficient social and behavioral interventions to support people living with
dementia and their caregivers. Also, there is a need to refine AD/ADRD risk stratification and responsiveness
to treatments. A key barrier to understanding how complex social/behavioral structures impact aging of
Hispanic Americans is that they are vastly underrepresented both in the research workforce and as participants
in research studies. To overcome these challenges, the Analysis Core (AnC) of the Rio Grande Valley (RGV)
AD/ADRD Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (AD/ADRD-RCMAR) at the University of Texas Rio
Grande Valley (UTRGV) will support high-quality, cutting-edge research in priority areas of behavioral and
social science research on AD/ADRD by RCMAR scientists, focusing on Hispanic Americans, and particularly
Mexican Americans of the impoverished US-Mexico border region in Texas. The breadth and depth of
AD/ADRD-RCMAR projects require state-of-the-art analytic approaches that enable longitudinal, high-
dimensional, and integrative analyses of data at the phenotypic, genetic, and environmental levels to exploit
relevant biomarkers and biological risk determinants that can point to interacting factors that may be targets for
interventions. The AnC will conduct such analyses for AD/ADRD-RCMAR scientists and further meet the field’s
needs by providing instructional higher-order analytical skill-building and technical training to fully prepare a
cadre of diverse minority early career stage investigators. The AnC, led by experts with a broad range of
complementary expertise, will serve as a critical mechanism for maximizing rigor and impact of the research
conducted by AD/ADRD RCMAR scientists. For the new funding cycle, we will achieve our objectives via the
following Specific Aims: 1) Provide analytical expertise and training in relevant statistical and bioinformatics
methods appropriate for complex, multisystem, and high dimensional data, including a novel integrative
analytical framework for diverse large data sets. 2) Maximize cross-study and cross-modality analyses among
all AD/ADRD-RCMARs’ projects by organizing and make available existing data sets on aging Mexican
Americans residing in South Texas into a central repository hosted in our high-performance computing cluster.
3) Disseminate scientific information on measurement tools, novel methodological developments, and new data
resources produced by and/or available to the AD/ADRD-RCMAR. Unique strengths of the RGV AnC include
experienced core leaders, a rich training and mentoring environment, the ability to foster careers of minority

10907833,"Project Summary – Research Education Component
The overwhelming burden of suffering, disability, and years of life lost due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) represent a global crisis. Hispanic Americans are at higher risk for
AD/ADRD and less likely to receive care and participate in research and service efforts designed to decrease
health disparities in AD/ADRD than their non-Hispanic White counterparts. This is particularly evident among
Hispanic Americans residing in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV), an area classified as persistent poverty and
medically underserved, where the prevalence of dementia is among the highest in the country.
Reaching and studying this population requires culturally-attuned and appropriately-trained investigators who
are prepared to advance social, behavioral, and community-engaged research with translational impact. There
is an equally great concomitant need to diversify the AD/ADRD research workforce, increasing representation
of members of the many communities, identities, races, ethnicities, backgrounds, abilities, cultures and beliefs,
including underserved communities, that make up the American people. The AD/ADRD-RCMAR’s Research
Education Component (REC) at the University of Texas RGV (UTRGV) puts into place a comprehensive
research education program with two overarching objectives: 1) to prepare a diverse body of early-career
junior faculty to grow into enduring careers as successful research scientists, and 2) to contribute in an
impactful way to the body of knowledge on health disparities in AD/ADRD among the growing US Hispanic
population, particularly aging Mexican Americans, along the Texas-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley
and South Texas. The REC will leverage the research expertise and resources of experienced, successful,
interdisciplinary investigators and leaders in these fields to achieve the following specific aims: (1) Identify and
support innovative pilot projects, focused on social or behavioral problems, aspects, or correlates of AD/ADRD
in minority populations. (2) Support the continued development of pilot project grant recipients as researchers.
(3) Provide training in grant preparation, administration, and budgeting. (4) Provide a series of
didactics/seminars on: a) Health disparities research survey; b) AD/ADRD-RCMAR Cores and key unique
research resources and their potential application to AD/ADRD health disparities research; c) AD/ADRD
research in Texas; and d) responsible conduct of research. (5) Provide continued mentoring. To accomplish
these goals, we have built a leadership team with extensive experience in research education, planning and
evaluation of mentoring, and leadership of collaborative interdisciplinary research efforts aimed at improving
minorities' and Hispanics' health in targeted geographic populations, and we have accounted for all needed
administrative and logistic support. Trainees and mentees will engage in and benefit from a rich immersive
experience in developing collaborative research addressing social and behavioral contributors to AD/ADRD
and its impacts in the poverty-stricken, primarily Hispanic US-Mexico border region of the RGV."

effort to train and support a diverse group of promising scientists in theory-based approaches for the
engagement of older Hispanics, especially Mexican Americans, and their families in social and behavioral
AD/ADRD research. The CLRC will also strengthen existing infrastructure for dissemination and translation of
research advances impacting the engaged communities, and to obtain community feedback and direction
aiming to establish true bi-directional learning, reciprocal expertise transfer, and enhance the Center Scientists’
expertise and commitment. The CLRC's Specific Aims are: (1) Working collaboratively with the Research
Education Core (REC), educate, train, and mentor AD/ADRD-RCMAR scientists in theory and approach to
community engagement for minority health disparities and assist AD/ADRD-RCMAR scientists in recruiting
older Hispanics and their families into their research studies; (2) Expand community-academic partnerships
and capacity to support recruitment and retention of older urban and rural Mexican Americans and their
families in South Texas, especially along the US/Mexico border; and (3) Disseminate research findings to the
scientific community, health care providers, and the South Texas communities served. We will achieve these
aims through strong mentorship of AD/ADRD-RCMAR scientists, linkage of scientists with established
investigators conducting community-based research in rural and urban Hispanic populations, and community
training to facilitate the widespread adoption of best practices for optimizing participation in research studies.
The results will create a state-of-the-art infrastructure for researchers, health care providers, advocates, and
policymakers interested in decreasing health disparities affecting older Hispanics, and in particular those
affected by AD/ADRD. To accomplish these goals, we have built a diverse team of scientists with extensive

diseases such as aplastic anaemia, or immunodeficiency diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency,
are life-threatening diseases and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a preferred curative therapy
for these serious conditions. BMT outcomes are limited by transplant related complications, mainly graft-versus-
host disease (GVHD) and opportunistic infections. Indeed, 15-20% of BMT patients will develop severe GVHD
that is fatal, particularly when involving the GI tract. Current prevention and treatment of GVHD rely on the broad
suppression of T cells and remains suboptimal. The initiation and maintenance of T cell responses are dependent
on activities mediated by antigen-presenting cells (APC) but the types of APC that initiate GVHD and the factors
that promote their function is currently limited. This is the focus of this proposal. In particular, we will build on our
preliminary data to test the hypothesis that epithelial APC in the ileum initiate lethal Th1 dependent acute GVHD.
We will utilize cutting-edge mechanistic preclinical murine studies with parallel clinical analysis, using advanced
flow cytometry, single cell RNA/CITE-seq and ATAC-seq with new spatial protein and sequencing platforms to
focus on antigen presentation in the gastrointestinal tract, identifying clinically tractable pathways that will prevent
the development of lethal acute GVHD. This R01 renewal will continue to identify new, rapidly testing therapeutic
approaches to prevent GVHD based on the inhibition of disease initiation (i.e. alloantigen presentation) rather
than broad T cell suppression in the late effector phase of disease, as is current practice."
10840877,"Malaria parasites contain a plastid organelle called the apicoplast that is required for parasite survival in
humans and for transmission to mosquitoes. The apicoplast has long been recognized as an important source
of new drug targets to combat the inevitable problem of drug resistance, however, it has proven difficult to
identify and validate apicoplast proteins that are essential for parasite survival. This goal is now achievable
using new genetic tools in combination with metabolic bypass of the apicoplast. Blood stage parasites treated
with the isoprenoid precursor IPP (isopentenyl pyrophosphate) survive apicoplast inhibitors - even those which
result in disruption of the organelle and loss of the organellar genome. We built on this finding by creating a
metabolic bypass parasite line that produces isoprenoid precursors in the cytosol using an engineered four-
enzyme mevalonate pathway. We propose to use a combination of genetic approaches in conjunction with
metabolic bypass to identify all nuclear-encoded proteins which are essential for apicoplast function and
parasite survival. We will also use new conditional tools (knockdown, conditional localization, DiCre) to further
characterize the roles of specific proteins and the phenotypes associated with their loss. Our experiments will
help to build a more complete picture of the metabolic pathways and non-metabolic processes required for
apicoplast function and parasite survival. Ultimately, we intend to identify novel targets and to validate known
targets for future development of drugs to cure malaria and stop its transmission."
10911276,"Chronic pelvic pain is debilitating and afflicts millions of patients in the U.S., yet pelvic pain
etiologies and effective therapies remain elusive. Microglia are CNS immune cells that play
significant roles in pain and are poised to respond to changes in microbiota, yet the roles of
microglia in pelvic pain are not fully described. Similarly, the microbiome influences many
biological processes and is recently appreciated to modulate pain, and we have identified gut
dysbiosis in pelvic pain patients and clinically relevant mouse models of pelvic pain. Microglia can
transduce microbiome signals by virtue of Toll-like receptors, but their roles in mediating pelvic
pain modulation by microbiota have not been explored. Here, we will evaluate the role of
microglia responses to microbiota in clinically-relevant models of pelvic pain. We hypothesize
that TLR4 mediates microglial responses to gut microbiota. We will test this hypothesis using two
clinically relevant mouse models of distinct underlying mechanisms that mimic postulated
etiologies of urologic pelvic pain, an infection model and a genetic susceptibility model. In Aim
1, we will quantify the role of microglia in rodent correlates of pain responses and cognitive
function and define microglial phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will define the role of TLR4 in microglia-
mediated pain. And in Aim 3, we will examine microglial responses to microbiota. Together, these
rigorous and innovative studies will provide the first characterization of TLR4 in microglia-
dependent pelvic pain responses to microbiota and thus pave the way for future probiotic
strategies for the treatment of urologic chronic pelvic pain."
10861872,"Abstract
 Anxiety and fear related disorders comprise some of most common mental illnesses. For anxiety disorders
alone, approximately 1 in 3 U.S adults will be affected at some point in their life. Currently available treatments
leave approximately 40% of patients without symptom resolution underscoring the need for new therapies to
be developed. A key to the rational development of new treatments is improved understanding of the
neurobiological mechanisms that regulate the neurons and circuits involved in fear and anxiety behaviors.
Areas of the brain involved in emotion, such as the basolateral amygdala (BLa) and medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) rely on synchronized neuronal oscillations in the theta band (4-12 Hz) to entrain local pyramidal
neurons (PNs) and synchronize activity across brain regions for proper long-range communication, and
information processing. Aberrant synchronization in these circuits contributes to deficits in emotion that
underlie fear disorders. However, despite the established role for theta oscillations in mPFC and BLa during
fear states, the mechanisms through which oscillations are generated in the BLa and synchronize with mPFC
are poorly understood. Critical to the function of these regions is the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh),
which promotes emotional learning and theta oscillations in BLa and mPFC. Supporting the vital role of ACh in
emotional circuits is the finding that perturbations of cholinergic signaling produce a range of behavioral
effects, including anxiogenic, or anxiolytic states, depressive symptoms, and disrupted fear and extinction
learning. Moreover, in all mammals, including humans, the BLa receives by far the most robust cholinergic
innervation of any target of the cholinergic basal forebrain. Despite its remarkably dense cholinergic
innervation, and critical importance in emotional memory, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms
through which ACh modulates BLa circuits. Therefore, the objective of these studies is to determine at a
cellular and circuit level how endogenously released ACh modulates amygdalar microcircuits to regulate fear
behaviors. Our central hypothesis is that ACh acts on distinct inhibitory microcircuits in the BLa to promote
local oscillations and synchrony between BLa and mPFC and enhance emotional memory. Our hypothesis is
based on preliminary data showing that basal forebrain-derived ACh alters BLa circuitry and facilitates
oscillatory synchrony with mPFC by differentially modulating distinct types of inhibitory interneurons in BLa.
Here, we propose to use electrophysiology, intracranial EEG recording, cell type specific targeting,
optogenetics, and behavior to determine the circuit mechanism by which synaptic acetylcholine modulates
local BLa oscillations (Aim 1), facilitates BLa-mPFC oscillatory synchrony and gates fear learning (Aim 2) and
regulates discrimination between safe and threatening cues (Aim 3). These studies will shed new light on
mechanisms underlying anxiety and fear disorders and the role of ACh in emotional processing."
10912769,"Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term goal of this project is to develop of a rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive screening
diagnostic based on an innovative broad proteomic approach to improve our ability to diagnose
infectious disease, monitor changes in the microbiome, measure the state of the host immune system,
and identify disease specific biomarkers. Specifically, the initiative will provide proof of principle for a
method to achieve simultaneous multi-pathogen detection and deep proteomic microbiome
characterization. We will work to detect the presence of several hundred pathogens while also
identifying thousands of microbes at clinically relevant levels. The short amino acid sequences or
peptides from the proteins will provide markers that range from the virus variant level, such as SARS-
CoV-2 variants of concern, to the family level, such as coronaviridae. In developing this diagnostic, a key
challenge is to maximize the sensitivity of peptide marker detection while analyzing for many clinically
relevant viruses and bacteria. We will therefore compare the performance of (a) a data-dependent
acquisition method that searches a custom database and (b) a data-independent acquisition method
that can identify thousands of proteins. The proposed study will begin with the analysis of
approximately twenty model pathogens before proceeding to the more ambitious analysis of more than
230 oro-respiratory samples. We will assess the primary factors that determine the performance of each
method and use our milestones to select one approach for further development. In the end, this
research will demonstrate the feasibility of a broad protein-based screening diagnostic that can detect
numerous pathogens and provide microbiome profiling to ultimately improve the diagnosis of disease
and assessment of human health. The project team includes researchers with diverse expertise from
Penn Engineering, Microbiology, and Penn Medicine."
10874560,"Synthetic hydrogels offer a promising platform for volumetric augmentation of the aerodigestive
tract for precision medicine approaches. We propose that an ideal biomaterial platform for PPW
augmentation to treat VPD would provide a durable tissue bulking effect, maintain implant
configuration, and avoid FBR within a dynamic tissue environment. Specifically, Microporous
Annealed Particle (MAP) hydrogels are an ideal material platform for the minimally invasive
treatment of VPD. This novel biomaterial is a promising scientific advancement that has
implications for improving VPD in patients with cleft and craniofacial conditions, particularly
related to pharyngeal wall augmentation for managing VPD. There is a pressing need to utilize
novel biomaterials and minimally invasive approaches to improve long-term outcomes for
managing and resolving VPD. To address this need, we have developed a novel iteration of MAP
hydrogel that is optimized for muscle implantation, tolerates dynamic movement, promotes
excellent tissue integration, and provides persistent tissue bulk via 1:1 volume replacement with
tissue de novo. Application of this unique biomaterial for PPW augmentation in an animal model
will allow for novel analyses and new clinical applications for the MAP hydrogel. This proposal
specifically aims to (1) quantify changes in pharyngeal wall anatomy in a rabbit model after
pharyngeal wall augmentation and (2) identify the host-implant microenvironment required to
achieve in situ tissue regeneration following optimized MAP gel pharyngeal wall augmentation."
10935954,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
If a facile method to site-selectively install prosthetic groups at internal sites in genetically-encoded RNA were
available, then it would be possible to modify RNAs and ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) in native
structural and intracellular context, thus elevating studies on RNA folding, trafficking, lifetime, interactomes and
regulatory pathways. The objective of this application is to test the extent to which compact U-rich internal loop
(URIL) sites can be used as a general targeting motif in structured RNAs. If it were possible to selectively
target the URIL motif with chemical probes, then juxtaposition of the URIL site with protein binding RNA motifs
would enable tracking and chemical modification of ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs). This would enable
elucidation of motif-specific RNA location and interactome by fluorogenic and proximity (biotin) labeling of URIL
RNPs; such unbiased motif-centered interactome readout is not possible with existing methods. We
hypothesize that appropriately modified, URIL-targeting bifacial peptide nucleic acids (bPNAs) could enable
intracellular fluorogenic URIL (FLURIL) RNA tracking and proximity labeling of URIL (PLURIL) RNPs,
respectively. Our proposed plan begins with the synthesis of bPNA probes, followed by rigorous in vitro and
intracellular evaluation, optimization and validation with existing tools and known interactome partners. FLURIL
RNP tagging will be benchmarked against MS2-labeling, the gold standard in RNA tracking. PLURIL tagging
will be tested by its efficacy in identification of known RNPs. Further, we will test the extent to which URIL tags
can be used to probe disease-relevant RNP biology in the intracellular context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS), using patient-derived cells. Investigation of ALS pathology is a highly active area, with attention focused
on two major forms: C9-ALS and Fus-linked ALS. While C9-ALS represents a majority of ALS cases,
Fus-linked ALS is most commonly found in juvenile, aggressive early-onset cases; notably, the pathological
mechanisms of these two forms appear to be distinct. Dysregulated RNP biology centered on C9orf72 RNA
(C9-ALS) and U1snRNA (Fus-linked ALS) identifies these transcripts as prime substrates for URIL tag probes.
The rigor in the prior research lies in the substantive preliminary and published data supporting intracellular
fluorogenic and proximity labeling of URIL-RNPs. These data form a strong scientific premise for the impactful
and unique application of motif-specific URIL-tagging as a broadly enabling discovery tool in ALS pathology
and other RNP-centered diseases."
10868647,"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a leading cause of biofilm-associated prosthetic joint infection (PJI)
characterized by antibiotic tolerance and evasion of immune-mediated clearance. Our laboratory has established
a critical role for granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs), a pathologically activated neutrophil
precursor, in attenuating monocyte/macrophage (MФ) proinflammatory properties and neutrophil bactericidal
activity that leads to S. aureus biofilm persistence. The metabolic attributes of leukocytes are intimately linked
with their inflammatory properties, relationships encompassing the emerging field of immunometabolism. This
has been best described for MФs, where biases towards aerobic glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation
(OxPhos) dictate pro- vs. anti-inflammatory activity, respectively. In contrast, little information is available
regarding the metabolic tendencies of G-MDSCs during infection and our preliminary studies are the first to
demonstrate that G-MDSCs exhibit a glycolytic bias following S. aureus biofilm exposure in vitro and in vivo.
Importantly, blocking glycolysis in G-MDSCs attenuated their suppressive activity resulting in decreased biofilm
burden in vivo. This provides proof-of-concept that targeting G-MDSC metabolism is a tractable and novel
approach to promote biofilm clearance. Recent studies have revealed that mitochondria can directly traffic
between cells in vitro and in vivo via tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), where mitochondrial transfer in recipient cells
promotes their OxPhos activity. However, most of these reports examined TNT-mediated mitochondrial transfer
between mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells or cardiomyocytes, whereas this mechanism of
intercellular metabolic rewiring has not been explored in the context of MФ-G-MDSC crosstalk. These studies
will leverage MФs as a source of mitochondria for reprogramming G-MDSC metabolism, which originated from
our prior work showing that MФ adoptive transfer reduced S. aureus biofilm burden in vivo. Indeed, our
preliminary data support this innovative concept, where MФs transferred their mitochondria to G-MDSCs in a
cell contact-dependent manner, which skewed G-MDSC metabolism towards OxPhos. This R21 revision will
investigate the hypothesis that increasing mitochondrial abundance in G-MDSCs will result in metabolic
reprogramming from glycolysis to an OxPhos bias coincident with diminished immune suppressive activity,
resulting in improved biofilm clearance. Understanding how mitochondrial transfer from MФs can reprogram G-
MDSC metabolism will be examined leveraging natural transfer and exogenous mitochondrial treatment
paradigms in the following Specific Aims. 1) Identify the functional implications of mitochondrial transfer on G-
MDSC anti-inflammatory activity and 2) Determine whether augmenting G-MDSC mitochondrial activity improves
S. aureus clearance during PJI. These studies will inform our long-term goal of targeting critical metabolic nodes
to reprogram aberrant leukocyte anti-inflammatory responses to eradicate biofilm together with antibiotics."
10912039,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An estimated 20% of hospitalized older adults were discharged to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) in 2019 with
many subsequently experiencing potentially adverse outcomes, including hospital re-admission, entering long-
term care (LTC) rather than returning to the community, and death within 6 months. During this critical
transition period following a hospitalization, clinicians, patients, and families often have discordant expectations
about the trajectory of the SNF stay which can lead to dissatisfaction with care and disagreements over care
plans. For SNF clinicians managing these patients, decision making around management of acute and chronic
conditions, treatment preferences, and advance care planning is hindered by a lack of accurate prognostic
information. Providing individualized risk estimates for a variety of outcomes following SNF admission can help
frame these important discussions and facilitate shared decision making. Given that there are no widely used
prognostic tools for older adults specifically discharged to a SNF, the objective of this study is to develop an
easy-to-use and parsimonious prediction model that jointly models multiple outcomes. A 20% sample of
community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older discharged from a hospital to a SNF will
be used to investigate two specific aims: (1) develop and internally validate a Day 1 prognostic model to be
used on day 1 of SNF admission that provides risk estimates of multiple outcomes including hospital re-
admission, discharge home without readmission, prolonged SNF stay >100 days (suggesting transition to
LTC), and 6-month mortality and (2) develop an Updated model which provides refined estimates using
detailed information from the Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment that may not be readily available or widely
collected by clinicians on day 1 of SNF admission. The result of these aims will be 2 easy-to-use parsimonious
models that can provide accurate and well calibrated estimates of outcomes following a SNF admission.
Significance and Innovation: Results from the proposed research project will directly inform clinical practice by
allowing SNF clinicians to input specific patient characteristics into a web calculator to obtain risk estimates for
multiple outcomes that can frame conversations with patients and families around clinical management
decisions and future planning. This project is innovative because it will be the first SNF outcome prediction
model to predict multiple clinically relevant outcomes simultaneously using a minimal number of variables that
can be easily implemented in clinical practice. Future directions of this work will involve investigating more
advanced modeling techniques, such as dynamic predictions and multi-state modeling, and ultimately explore
how providing this prognostic information can improve satisfaction with care and other patient-centered
outcomes in a randomized clinical trial."
10900616,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are at higher risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) compared to
the general population. As such, they are considered an ideal target population for anti-AD therapy trials;
however, there is no reliable measure for predicting dementia onset in this population. Intraindividual cognitive
variability (IICV), a measure of variability in neuropsychological test performance within a person at a single
timepoint, is a novel, low-cost, non-invasive biomarker of neurodegeneration and early dementia for the general
population. However, IICV has not been investigated in adults with DS. Therefore, the current proposal will fill
this knowledge gap by characterizing the associations between IICV, AD biomarkers, and dementia in adults
with DS. Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal use data from the Alzheimer’s Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome
(ABC-DS) study, which is currently composed of cognitive and biomarker data collected at two different
timepoints (baseline and 18 months), to calculate IICV measures for memory, executive function and processing
speed, visuospatial construction, and multidomain cognition in 300 adults with DS. Using the longitudinal ABC-
DS data, we will first examine whether IICV is associated with AD plasma biomarkers (β-amyloid 42/40, p-
tau217, and NfL) and/or AD-related pathology (Aβ-PET and tau-PET) (K99, Aim 1). We will also examine
whether IICV is associated with the clinical presentation of dementia and cognitive decline (K99, Aim 2).
We expect our analyses to show that IICV is positively associated with AD-related biomarkers and pathology,
and that IICV at baseline is associated with a follow-up diagnosis of dementia as well as cognitive decline from
baseline to follow-up. These data will be critical for optimizing the design of a new cohort study of adults with DS
that will test the outcome measures from Aims 1 and 2 in a new, more diverse, cross-cultural cohort of
adults with DS from Washington State and São Paulo, Brazil, and include comparisons with a control
group of individuals with autosomal dominant AD, due to its similarity with DS in early striatal amyloid-
β deposition (R00, Aim 3). To complete these aims, we have developed a comprehensive, mentored training
plan for me to (1) gain expertise in the relationship between neuropsychology, plasma biomarkers and
neuroimaging; (2) broaden my knowledge of the similarities and differences between autosomal dominant AD
and AD in DS; (3) explore cross-cultural similarities and differences in AD risk; and (4) develop advanced
statistical skills. The data and training obtained in the K99 phase will lead to the successful implementation of a
high-quality, international research program focused on IICV and AD biomarkers in DS. Findings have great
potential to be used with the DS population worldwide, increasing the chances of early interventions and inclusion
in anti-AD trials. The intense training in the K99 and the support of mentors with extensive expertise in all areas
of the proposal, will provide the foundation for an independent scientific career on cross-cultural AD risk
prediction in DS and other high-risk populations."
10893567,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are considered a source for allogeneic therapies to treat
diverse diseases. Due to the exponential increase in demand, there is a need for new strategies to produce
potent hMSCs to serve diverse patient populations. Currently, conventional planar culture and bioreactors are
used as scale-up manufacturing methods. However, these are not specifically tailored for hMSCs expansion.
They may alter the cell phenotype and secretome, affecting clinical effectiveness. Further studies to understand
the role of substrate mechanics on hMSC expansion are required to achieve reproducible production. Numerous
scaffolding alternatives replicate several characteristics of the native extracellular matrix (ECM). However, its
dynamic mechanics, which plays a fundamental role in regulating crucial cellular processes, has not been amply
studied yet. Furthermore, most in-vitro substrates are static and supraphysiologically stiff. Static substrates have
offered a substantial benefit for generating high cell numbers; however, hMSCs have been shown to retain
mechanical information, limiting therapeutic capabilities. To address this problem, this proposed research seeks
to investigate the role of dynamic cell-matrix interactions and nano-topographical cues on the immunomodulatory
potential of hMSCs using a composite of electrospun-fibers encapsulated in a dynamic hydrogel, with the
hypothesis that this composite biomaterial will promote high hMSCs production with relevant therapeutic value,
while eliminating the limitations reported for the conventional cell culture systems. The K99 period will focus on
engineering and characterizing the dynamic nanofibrous hydrogel composites to propel me toward establishing
the mechanisms by which they modulate cell quality and potency attributes with relevant therapeutic value
(during the R00 phase). In Aim 1, we will develop the dynamic nanofibrous system using a hyaluronic acid
hydrogel network crosslinked via dynamic covalent hydrazone bonds that capture the viscoelasticity of ECM in
tissues. Four variables, including the encapsulation of the electrospun collagen nanofibers at various densities,
fiber diameter, fiber length, and the stress relaxation timescale of the hydrogel will be characterized in this aim
to promote hMSC viability and proliferation. In Aim 2, hMSCs cell quality and potency will be assessed by
measuring the effect of hydrogel parameters on cellular secretory activity. Immunomodulatory properties will be
evaluated by quantifying lymphocyte suppression in co-culture, as well as expression of hMSC surface markers.
The capacity of the hMSCs to differentiate will also be assessed. In aim 3, the mechanism linking the biophysical
parameters of the nanofibrous hydrogel to hMSC secretory activity will be probed by examining cell adhesive
proteins and the activation of transcription factors or sensors of mechanical cues. In sum, the proposed research
will lead to new insights to produce hMSCs with high therapeutic value, which will enable new culture substrates
that achieve control in reproducibility and cell quality to serve diverse patient populations."

Understanding and manipulating cell signaling processes is crucial for adoptive cell therapies (ACT), which
show significant promise in treating diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Many of the current challenges in
manufacturing these therapeutics are related to our lack of control over ex vivo T cell activation. Though
tremendous progress has been made in understanding how extracellular signaling cues influence intracellular
states, our understanding of detailed mechanisms governing these processes is incomplete. Mounting
evidence suggests that cell signaling is regulated by the physical arrangement of signaling structures at the
surface of cells. However, determining how the spatial arrangement of signaling structures guides cell behavior
is very difficult due to the nanoscale size of these structures, which is below the resolution limit of traditional
light microscopy.
This study will provide crucial information towards elucidating the role of spatial organization in T cell
regulation, as well as test the feasibility of novel tools to study and manipulate structures on the nanoscale.
Our objective is to determine how 3D spatial arrangements of signaling molecules affect T cell behavior. To do
so, we will use DNA origami nanostructures to arrange ligands into nanoscale 3D patterns, then present these
patterned ligands to T cells and characterize signaling dynamics, we will also assess ACT-relevant parameters
such as T cell proliferation rate and IL-2 secretion. Our rationale is that by defining the relationship between
ligand arrangement and T cell signaling, we will better understand how the organization of signaling molecules
at the cell surface regulates intracellular pathways, which will guide the development of optimized reagents for
efficient ex vivo T cell activation. This project will leverage nanotechnology, biochemistry, and cell to
accomplish three Specific Aims: 1) determine the relationship between extracellular receptor kinase dynamics
and 3D stimulatory ligand arrangement, 2) determine the spatial dependence of inhibitory receptors on T cell
activation, and 3) create patterned T cell signaling reagents that can trigger ex vivo primary T cell activation.
We will define the relationship between the spatial organization of signaling molecules and intracellular
pathways, and in establishing the foundation for nanopatterned immunotherapy reagents. This knowledge will
allow us to more deeply understand the mechanisms underlying T cell activation and differentiation, enabling
efficient and efficacious manufacturing of cell therapies for cancer, diabetes, and other diseases."
10875446,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 T cells specific for pancreatic beta cell antigens drive an autoimmune response leading to type 1 diabetes
(T1D). During the onset of T1D, many immune cell types infiltrate into pancreatic islets, but the infiltration of each
individual islet varies substantially within an individual mouse or human. Additionally, the interactions between
immune cells and resident islet cells vary over the immune response within the microenvironment of an individual
islet from infiltration and initial activation to a period of regulation before eventual destruction. A better
understanding of factors that control autoreactive T cell function in the islets could lead to therapies for T1D that
target the underlying mechanisms that cause disease. Based on our published work and new preliminary data,
our central hypothesis is that autoreactive CD8+ T cell destruction of beta cells is determined by activation of the
basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors in response to the islet antigens and the local cellular
microenvironment. We predict that these programs are differentially induced in CD8+ T cells by the cellular
microenvironment of each individual islet. We propose two aims to test these predictions during onset of T1D in
NOD mice using novel single cell functional genomics approaches. In Aim 1 we will determine the contribution
of the bZIP transcription factors family to autoreactive T cell function in the pancreas. In Aim 2 we will determine
impact of macrophages on the transcriptional programs of individual cells between separate pancreatic islet
microenvironments. The expected results of our study will address unanswered questions about the fundamental
mechanisms controlling T cell activity and immune cell interplay during autoimmune disease."
10878886,"Giardia lamblia is a widespread protozoan parasite of humans and animals causing significant diarrheal disease
worldwide. Giardia cysts are transmitted between hosts through feces. Once ingested, cysts transform into
trophozoites that colonize the duodenal epithelium – a region of varied nutrients, redox stress, and immune
responses. Unknown external cues in the gut trigger trophozoites to encyst, and then cysts are passed to new
hosts. Giardia is also reported to have a quasi-meiotic stage, termed diplomixis, that occurs in late encystation
and is characterized by fusing and exchange of DNA between cyst nuclei. Due to a historical lack of molecular
genetic tools, the pathogenesis and basic biology of Giardia is grossly understudied. Developmental transitions
and environmental responses are commonly mediated by transcription factors (TFs) – modular proteins that often
contain DNA binding domains (DBDs). However, only 36 TFs with DBDs are predicted in the Giardia genome
as compared to about 200 predicted in similar sized eukaryotic genomes. Over 500 proteins have more general
motifs such as basic leucine-zipper domains, and these can also function as TFs. Only a handful of Giardia TFs
have been studied in any detail; all are associated with early to mid-encystation. Basal TFs, redox responsive TFs,
late encystation/diplomixis TFs, or cell cycle related TFs have not yet been identified. Our lack of knowledge of
the identities and functions of Giardia TFs has severely limited our understanding of genetic regulatory
networks throughout the Giardia life cycle, particularly those associated with cell division and pathogenesis.
To address these deficits, we will use an unbiased, high-throughput, genome-wide yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) screen
to identify additional DNA binding proteins likely representing candidate TFs (Aim 1). In many systems, such
screens are commonly used to define genome-wide protein-DNA interactions. Using robotic screening of arrayed
“prey” libraries, we will screen a total of nine promoter “baits” (three constitutive loci; three redox stress-
associated loci, and three encystation loci) against three “prey” cDNA libraries (constitutive; redox stress; late
encystation/diplomixis) for a total of 27 (3 x 3 x 3) combinations. Both predicted DBD proteins and candidate TFs
identified in the Y1H screen will be additionally prioritized by CRISPRi mediated knockdown, with phenotypic
screening for defects in growth, mid-encystation and genetic marker exchange in cysts (diplomixis), and redox
stress. Knockdowns of candidate TFs with strong defects will be further characterized using promoter-luciferase
assays and a novel dCas-TF luciferase fusion assay to evaluate transcriptional activation or repression (Aim 2).
Overall, this project will define and prioritize Giardia TFs as groundwork for future interrogation of Giardia
regulatory networks throughout the life cycle."

American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) are increasingly
concerned about Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), as these conditions will soon have a major
impact on their communities. Although AI/ANs and NHPIs are culturally diverse, they share a high prevalence of
ADRD risk factors. Life expectancies for AI/ANs and NHPIs have improved resulting in a tripling of their
population share of people aged 65 and older. These changing demographics make ADRD much more visible
in AI/AN and NHPI communities. AI/ANs and NHPIs also face challenges related to their physical, mental,
spiritual, and emotional health over the life course that increases their disparities in health outcomes, reduces
their resiliency in mid- and late-life, and increases their vulnerability and risk of ADRD. The confluence of
perceived need, high risk, and limited data serves as the basis for the renewal application of the Native
Alzheimer’s Disease Resource Center in Minority Aging Research (NAD-RCMAR). Our transdisciplinary
research team offers unique scientific resources and integrates perspectives from multiple disciplines and an
extensive network of community partnerships. Based at the University of Miami along with Washington State
University, Northern Arizona University, University of New Mexico, Wake Forest University, and a network of
Satellite Centers led by Indigenous researchers covering 7 Health and Human Services regions and Hawaii, we
will continue to create and grow an innovative program to understand, intervene on, and mitigate the ADRD-
related health disparities experienced by AI/ANs and NHPIs. Our overarching goals are to fund meritorious Pilot
Studies led by early-stage investigators known as NAD-RCMAR Scientists, whose work will advance our
understanding of ADRD health disparities in AI/AN and NHPI communities; provide NAD-RCMAR Scientists with
mentorship in study design, culturally appropriate research methodology, biostatistical approaches so that their
work meets the highest scientific standards; deliver career development activities to enhance NAD-RCMAR
Scientists' academic advancement and the pursuit of independent careers in ADRD research; and contribute
empirical evidence regarding ADRD in other minority populations. Our Specific Aims are to 1) Build a dynamic
infrastructure, and provide scientific expertise and resources to enhance the diversity of the ADRD research
workforce; 2) Recruit and mentor promising NAD-RCMAR Scientists, especially those of AI/AN, NHPI, and other
URM backgrounds, to conduct Pilot Studies in the social, behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical sciences on
ADRD; and 3) Promote advances in ADRD research and increase the number of independent AI/AN, NHPI and
other URM researchers who can address the health and well-being of AI/AN and NHPI elders. The leadership,
resources, and experience of our team offer an unprecedented opportunity to address NIA’s research priorities
for ADRD among URMs with themes articulated in the 2019 NIA BSR Report. Our Center directly responds to

Healthy People 2030, a decennial public health roadmap set by the US Department of Health and Human
Services, calls for public health research and policy focused on improving health equity, with key objectives
related to social determinants of health, including resilience against negative health outcomes. Despite prior
Healthy People objectives to address health disparities among different racial/ethnic groups, the conditions of
birth, learning, labor, and aging continue to unduly influence health outcomes, further exacerbated by prevalent
socioeconomic inequities. Disparities affecting American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) and Native
Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHPI) are exceptionally persistent, and are especially problematic in diseases of
aging, such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). A key knowledge gap is that methods to
identify, diagnose, and risk stratify patients have not been adapted for use in AI/AN and NHPI, who have unique
social, environmental, and access pressures influencing ADRD prevalence, diagnosis, and characterization.
Thus, specific approaches for studying ADRD in AI/AN and NHPI are urgently needed. This Native Alzheimer’s
Disease Resource Center in Minority Aging Research (NAD-RCMAR) is well positioned to enable early-stage
investigators to conduct impactful Pilot Studies on ADRD risk and resilience factors in AI/AN and NHPI, by using
mentoring and structured analytic techniques designed to yield strong conclusions and serve as preliminary data
for grant proposals. The NAD-RCMAR Analysis Core (AnC) is structured to emphasize methods training,
mentoring, and support in ADRD research affecting AI/AN and NHPI populations. Our AnC is well positioned to
support NAD-RCMAR Scientists with methods mentoring and biostatistics support for Pilot Studies; methods
consultation for grant writing; partner with other NAD-RCMAR components to provide didactic instruction; and
develop a research resource of datasets focused on ADRD risk and resilience in AI/AN and NHPI. Our Specific
Aims are to (1) Collaborate with Research Education Component (REC) to provide mentoring and didactic
instruction to NAD-RCMAR Scientists, with a focus on methods for data collection and analysis in risk and
resilience of ADRD disparities affecting AI/AN and NHPI; (2) Collaborate with NAD-RCMAR faculty so that NAD-
RCMAR Scientists can design, conduct, analyze and interpret high-quality research on risk and resilience
disparities in ADRD among AI/AN and NHPI; (3) Provide structured support to NAD-RCMAR Scientists in data
management, analysis, and inference; (4) Maintain and develop a database of studies with data on ADRD risk
and resilience in AI/AN and NHPI; and (5) Work with RCMAR Coordinating Center to share data and information.
Overall, this AnC will help NAD-RCMAR Scientists to maximize scientific rigor while accommodating logistical
and methodological challenges in studying ADRD in AI/AN and NHPI. Our overarching goal is to optimize the
quality of research publications and grant proposals produced by NAD-RCMAR Scientists, to prepare them for
independent contribution and success in a rapidly expanding field of research."
10907795,"ABSTRACT – Research Education Component
More than 6 million people in the US have Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD). The extant
literature suggests that the risk of ADRD are higher among racial and ethnic minorities, especially American
Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) and Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders (NHPIs). Unfortunately, there is a
paucity of critical research on ADRD in Indigenous peoples. A search of the PubMed database using MeSH
terms “Alzheimer’s disease” and “American Indian or Alaska Native” retrieved just 32 relevant publications, while
a parallel search for NHPIs returned only 19 publications. AI/ANs and NHPIs are also underrepresented in the
NIA-funded Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers Program with only 454 of 45,923 participants in the 37
Centers over the past 17 years primarily identifying as AI/AN or NHPI. Because the data from these Centers
lead to some of the most influential ADRD studies, poor representation of AI/AN and NHPI participants assures
that they make limited contributions to research findings, healthcare policy or clinical treatment standards.
Furthermore, because very few AI/AN or NHPI scientists conduct ADRD research. The goal of the Native
Alzheimer’s Disease Resource Center in Minority Aging Research (NAD-RCMAR) is to build research capacity,
enhance diversity in the professional workforce, and nurture innovative social, behavioral, epidemiological, and
clinical research in ADRD. The scientific focus of the Research Education Component (REC) will be health
disparities related to ADRD in AI/ANs and NHPIs by focusing on modifiable risk and resilience factors occurring
in mid- and late-life that both increase the risk of ADRD and are highly relevant to AI/AN and NHPI communities.
The REC will enhance the diversity of the ADRD research workforce by mentoring promising NAD-RCMAR
Scientists especially from underrepresented minority (URM) groups, focusing on AI/ANs and NHPIs. The REC
will offer NAD-RCMAR Scientists support in study design and measurement for our Pilot Studies and will deliver
a workshop modelled after the highly successful Grantwriting Uncovered: Maximizing Strategies, Help,
Opportunities, Experiences (GUMSHOE) program. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Offer logistical, and scientific
resources to support innovative Pilot Studies on ADRD in AI/ANs and NHPIs to generate preliminary data for
publications and subsequent grant applications; (2) Increase the number of AI/AN, NHPI, and other URM
investigators conducting ADRD research; (3) Initiate and maintain mentoring relationships between senior
researchers and NAD-RCMAR Scientists; (4) Improve the methodological skills of NAD-RCMAR Scientists
through didactic educational sessions on research methods and their conduct of Pilot Study research; and (5)
Ensure Pilot findings are published in high-impact refereed journals and lead to extramural funding. The NAD-
RCMAR will require representation of AI/ANs and NHPIs in ADRD studies, while engaging early- and mid-stage
professionals in career training and research activities that will prepare them to become independent
investigators, thereby enriching and advancing this field of inquiry and diversifying the workforce."

Attention deficit (AD) is a reported concern across mental health and neurological disorders. It exists as an extreme
condition of a continuously distributed trait in the general population. AD as a key component of ADHD is often associated
with impairments in multiple neurocognitive domains, particularly in attention/vigilance, working memory, processing
speed, and response variability. To date, most investigations on AD focus on frontal-parietal circuity, and less is known
about the frontal-thalamo-cerebellar circuitry (FCC) relates to AD. To extend our knowledge on neural mechanisms of AD,
this study aims to delineate FCC alteration in relation to neurocognition and AD symptoms, leveraging longitudinal brain
imaging data, genomics, neurocognition, environmental data in ABCD cohort. First, in Aim 1 we will apply advanced deep
learning algorithms to model the relationship between multimodal brain image data in FCC (gray matter, white matter, rest
state fMRI functional connectivity, and emotional N-back task fMRI activation) and neurocognitive measures in the four
domains (attention/vigilance, working memory, processing speed, and response variability) at baseline. And then we will
apply the transfer learning techniques to the latent neuroimaging features underlying neurocognition to estimate AD. Then,
in Aim 2 we will focus on the relation between longitudinal changes of FCC neuroimaging features and the changes in
neurocognition and AD in two years. We will apply advanced machine learning methods just as in Aim 1 to identify FCC
dynamic features underlying longitudinal changes in neurocognition, and then transfer to AD. AD symptoms and symptom
changes are also affected by genetic profiles and environmental factors. In Aim 3 we will apply multivariate data mining
algorithms to extract genetic factors associated with FCC neuroimaging features, and build a prediction model for AD and
changes of AD using genetic factors extracted, social demographic and environmental factors, in addition to FCC
multimodal neuroimaging features. Lastly, in Aim 4 we will validate the FCC-genetic-environmental-AD model using Year
4 follow up data in ABCD cohort and validate the FCC-genetic-AD model using an independent PNC cohort. The findings
from this study will specify alterations in crucial regions of FCC underlying each neurocognition domain and contribution
of each neurocognition domain to AD symptoms mediated by FCC neuronal features. Brain, gene, and environmental model
of AD will help identify a subpopulation with risk for AD due to FCC alterations in the general population, and help specify
patients across the boundaries of mental disorders who are risk for worsening AD due to FCC abnormalities."

Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is the most common hematologic disorder affecting millions of people worldwide.
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment but is associated with a
significant risk of treatment-related organ toxicities and graft failure. While myeloablative total body irradiation
(TBI) conditioning facilitates full engraftment, it is associated with higher organ toxicities. Conversely, reduced
intensity conditioning is associated with less organ toxicities, but the risk of graft rejection is higher, and partial
chimerism achieved with RIC cannot resolve the hematological abnormalities in most cases. Therefore, a
conditioning regimen that can increase chimerism while lowering regimen-related toxicities is an unmet need to
treat SCD. We recently successfully treated our first SCD patient with image-guided total marrow irradiation
(TMI), delivering 6 Gy of radiation to the bone marrow (BM) while limiting the vital organ dose to 0-2 Gy,
followed by matched donor HCT, which resulted in full chimerism without adverse events. Yet, the exact
mechanism of the enhanced donor chimerism after TMI is not clear; emphasizing the need for preclinical
studies. We have developed the first preclinical 3D image-guided TMI bone marrow transplant (BMT) model,
using immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice and humanized homozygous BERK sickle mice (SS). Initial work
suggests TMI-based bone marrow targeted dose escalation is feasible in the SCD mice model supporting
increased chimerism and reduced organ damage. In collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, we will test a
thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetic drug (TPOm, aka JNJ-26366821), which is a fully synthetic, PEGylated TPO
receptor, c-MPL agonist peptide. The safety of TPOm has been proven in Phase I clinical trials and is phase II
ready. Our preliminary data in a mouse model suggest post-BMT TPOm administration can enhance HSC
regeneration, mitigate radiation damage, and support vascular regeneration. We hypothesize that the TMI-
based dose escalation will facilitate engraftment (higher homing and chimerism) with minimal toxicities to other
organs, resulting in improved pathophysiology of SCD. We further hypothesize that TPOm intervention along
with TMI will improve BM vascular recovery, HSC expansion, and engraftment. To test the hypothesis, we will
Optimize donor cell homing, engraftment, and expansion after BMT in a rodent SCD model using the following
sub-aims. We will identify the optimal TMI dose to enhance donor chimerism and full engraftment which will
reduce hemolysis, anemia, and tissue damage. We will investigate how TMI-based differential dose escalation
activates SDF-1 gradient to support increasing donor cell homing to the bone marrow. Investigate if adding
TPOm can further improve engraftment by augmenting BM vascular recovery and donor HSC expansion.
The overarching goal of our interdisciplinary proposal is to produce a clinically relevant, effective, and safe TMI
dose escalation alone or in combination with TPOm to improve chimerism and vascular regeneration while
lowering regimen-related toxicities after HCT for SCD."

Diabetes disproportionately impacts the 60 million individuals living in rural areas where the prevalence of Type
2 diabetes (T2D) is ~17% higher than in urban areas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC)
National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) which includes a minimum of 16 weekly core sessions over 6
mos. and 6 monthly maintenance sessions provides the framework for the prevention of T2D in the U.S.
NDPP recognized programs are available in ~28% of U.S. counties; however, access to at least 1 NDPP
recognized program is significantly lower in rural (2.6%) compared with urban areas (11.1%). The Cooperative
State Research, Education and Extension Service, a partnership between the U.S Department of Agriculture,
land-grant universities and county governments represents a potentially effective but underutilized site for
delivery of NDPP to rural residents. However, evidence to support the effectiveness of the NDPP lifestyle
intervention in rural adults with prediabetes defined by CDC criteria, with the intervention delivered by
Cooperative Extension staff who have completed CDC approved training and using CDC recommendations for
both program curriculum and meeting schedule is unavailable. Distance learning, e.g., group video using
Zoom®, for delivery of NDPP is currently approved for CDC recognition. Remote delivery platforms provide a
potentially cost-effective strategy for improving participation and retention, which are both important predictors
of weight loss and reduced diabetes incidence in NDPP. The proposed 12-mo. Type II hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial will compare the effectiveness of the NDPP protocol delivered via distance learning by
agents associated with Kansas State Research and Extension (KSRE) serving as a lifestyle coach (GV-NDPP)
vs. a self-directed control arm (SD-NDPP) which will receive the NDPP curriculum on the same schedule used
for the GV-NDPP arm delivered to individual participants via an iPad® with available lifestyle coach support.
Ten KSRE local units/districts serving rural Kansas counties will be allocated to either active (n=5) or passive
recruitment (n=5). Active recruitment will form collaborations with rural health clinics to identify potential
participants using clinic electronic health records. Passive recruitment will use traditional recruitment
techniques, e.g., flyers, email list serves, media advertising etc. Each of the 10 sites will recruit 16 adults with
prediabetes defined using current NDPP criteria living in the county served by KSRE (n=160) who will be
randomized (1:1) to one of the 2 intervention arms. Aim 1 will compare weight change between the GV-NDPP
and SD-NDPP arms across 12 mos. Secondarily, we will compare the proportion of participants meeting CDC
weight loss (≥5%) and physical activity goals (≥150 min./wk.), and changes in hemoglobin A1c across 12 mos.
between intervention arms. Aim 2 will compare the effectiveness of passive and active recruitment. Aim 3 will
compare the cost and cost effectiveness of delivery (GV-NDPP vs. SD-NDPP) and recruitment (passive vs.
active) methods."

Germ cells have the extraordinary potential to generate every cell type in the body. Yet, the molecular program
that protects and sustains this promise for totipotency in germ cells, which can last more than forty years in
humans, is poorly understood. To face this challenge, germline regulators assume dual roles in maintaining germ
cell identity: activating a germline transcriptional program while simultaneously protecting germ cells from
reprogramming to a somatic cell fate. Indeed, genes involved in germline specification, such as the conserved
RNA-binding protein Nanos and the transposable element (TE) regulator Piwi, are erroneously upregulated in
certain human tumors. These tumors are thought to undergo soma-to-germline transformations to acquire a
more immortal, germline-like state. However, a specific program for germ cell transcriptional activation has yet
to be described, mainly because a ‘master-regulator transcription factor’ for germ cell fate is missing. This
proposal uses a multipronged approach to systematically characterize the gene expression program in primordial
germ cells (PGCs) and identify prime regulators of germ cell fate. The goal is to distinguish between a ‘default’
model, by which repression of the somatic program ‘allows’ the PGC program, and an ‘instructive’ model, by
which PGC specification is actively controlled. In Aim1, we probe the instructive model to uncover the germline
transcriptional program. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we have detected specific, temporally-regulated
germline genes. To identify the transacting regulatory factors, we will use ATAC-sequencing, characterize known
factors with matching binding activities, and identify potential new regulatory candidates for germline genes. In
Aim2, we address the function of a critical regulator of germ cell fate, the conserved RNA regulator Nanos. Using
the RNA target identification method hyper-TRIBE and ribosome profiling, we will identify Nanos targets and
functionally distinguish between those targets that promote the germline program and/or repress the somatic
program. Aim3 focuses on the piRNA pathway, which provides maternally inherited immunity against TE activity
by controlling the transcription of TE elements, specifically in germ cells. Using a novel degradation strategy to
specifically degrade components of the piRNA pathway in PGCs without impacting oogenesis, we will determine
the role of this pathway for embryonic PGC gene expression beyond TE control. By integrating multiplex findings,
this proposal will uncover the regulatory landscape of early germ cells, thereby providing a necessary
understanding of the process of gonadogenesis and, ultimately, the survival of the species."

Adult zebrafish have a remarkable capacity to regenerate the heart with minimal scarring. Understanding the
underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms will help addressing the regenerative deficiency in the adult
mammalian heart. We recently found that the zebrafish epicardium (the outermost layer of vertebrate hearts)
regenerates after injury by the creation of a leader region of polyploid cells (having two or more copies of the
genome). Polyploidy has been observed in many mammalian organs following injury and recently has been
invoked in mechanisms of tissue repair. However, the functional significance of polyploidy, as well as its
underlying mechanisms in tissue repair, remains elusive, representing a major knowledge gap in harnessing the
advantages of polyploidy in tissue repair. We found that, through collective cell migration, these leader epicardial
cells guide a trailing population of much smaller, dividing follower cells to repopulate the wound. The leader cell
population is established and maintained by endoreplication and is eliminated through apoptosis upon
completion of regeneration, indicating a transient role. The elevated cellular tension in the leader cells drives
endoreplication. This coordinated behavior of leader and follower cells facilitates robust regeneration of the
epicardium. Also, we found that the polyploid epicardial cells are a major source of paracrine secretion for heart
regeneration. The overall objective of our proposal is to understand the mechanisms that regulate spatiotemporal
cell behavior of the epicardium and how defects in this behavior impact heart regeneration. Through single-cell
RNA sequencing, reporter assays, and pharmacological treatments, we have discovered a novel signaling
pathway together with Yap signaling that participate in the spatiotemporal polyploidization in the epicardium. We
will 1) characterize the signaling cascade that involves mechanical cues, Yap, and the new pathway in regulating
spatiotemporal polyploidization during epicardial regeneration, 2) define the leader signals that drive leader-
follower coordination in epicardial regeneration, and 3) investigate the functional significance of epicardial
polyploidy in heart regeneration. The proposed research will define a new signaling paradigm in guiding cell
cycle decisions for efficient heart regeneration. Moreover, polyploid cells are present in normal tissues such as
the mammalian cardiomyocytes, as well as in pathological processes such as lung injury, acute kidney injury,
and cancer. Results from our study will unearth conceptual innovations concerning the regulation of cell cycle
decisions to mediate physiological and pathological polyploidization and robust tissue regeneration."

Cellular contractility plays a critical role in both development and disease. Recent evidence suggests that even
within a cell population derived from the same source, vast heterogeneity exists in terms of cellular contractility.
Dysregulation of spatiotemporally organized cellular contractility often results in developmental defects. In
invasive diseases like cancer which are often highly contractile, the existence of a weakly contractile
subpopulation is receiving increasing attention. Adherent cells are known for their ability to sense and
dynamically adapt to their local microenvironment. Hence, the heterogeneity in mechanical phenotype may be a
result of genetic heterogeneity or cellular plasticity and mechanical adaptation. Mechanomedicines or mechano-
based therapies that target specific physical cellular and tissue interactions, including abnormal cellular
contractility, in diseases like cancer, fibrosis, and cardiovascular disease, as well as aging, are emerging and
hold great potential. While mechanical heterogeneity and plasticity are known to contribute to resistance to
therapies that target a specific molecular pathway, it is not clear whether a change in mechanical phenotype
predicts disease outcome or if mechanical adaption happens as a result of disease progression. This project
proposes to phenotypically sort adherent cells into subpopulations with distinct contractile phenotypes and use
these sorted subpopulations to test the hypothesis that the initial contractile phenotype and heterogeneity
determine the disease outcome against the alternative hypothesis that mechanical adaptation to the local
microenvironment and phenotypical switching contribute to disease progression regardless of the initial
mechanical heterogeneity. Cancer metastasis will be used as the main biological model for hypothesis testing.
In Aim 1, the engineering approach for cell sorting based on cellular contractility will be optimized. Fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) will be coupled with an engineered high throughput cell contractility screening
platform, automated microscopy, and photoactivation and fluorescent labeling of cells for cell separation. In Aim
2, the sorted contractile subpopulations will be used to test the main biological hypothesis in vitro and in vivo
against the alternative hypothesis. Engineered systems mimicking the environmental conditions in cancer
progression will be designed to characterize the migration, proliferation, survival, and metabolism of the
subpopulations, as well as their mechanical adaptation. The metastatic potential of these subpopulations and
their mechanical adaptations at various stages along the metastatic cascade will be examined in a mouse tumor
model. The innovative aspect of this proposal is the concept to sort by cellular contractility with the goal of
uncovering the role of initial mechanical phenotype in the progression of diseases like cancer and in development.
This project will use the novel engineered cell sorting approach to dissect the respective roles of mechanical
heterogeneity and adaptability in disease progression, thus laying the foundation for future work to identify the
key molecular pathways to precisely target for the development of mechanomedicine."

Sepsis is a leading cause of death in critical care units. Our long-term research goal is to
understand the mechanisms of sepsis-induced multi-organ failure and to identify
potential new therapeutic opportunities for this devastating clinical condition. Studies
proposed in this application are designed to elucidate novel pathological functions of an
immunometabolism regulator, growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), in
sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy using preclinical models.
Recent studies revealed that macrophages localized in the heart are originated from
different sources. With diversified functions ranging from reparative to inflammatory, the
dynamics of changing these macrophage subsets forms a diagram of cardiac
macrophage plasticity. Our ongoing investigation have obtained exciting preliminary
evidence showing that GHS-R is a critical cellular switch that reprograms macrophage
polarization to an inflammatory state. Furthermore, in a newly generated genetic mouse
model, our data showed that ablation of myeloid linage macrophage-specific GHS-R
attenuated systemic inflammation and improved heart function in response to
endotoxemia challenge, which benefits were well associated with responses in
metabolism, mitochondria, and autophagy in the heart. In this exploratory project, we will
use in vitro and in vivo approaches to test the hypothesis that macrophage GHS-R
reprograms cardiac macrophage plasticity and stimulates inflammation during sepsis
(aim 1). We will further address whether macrophage GHS-R stimulates mitochondrial
deficiencies, metabolic perturbations, and maladaptive autophagy in the heart during
sepsis (aim 2). Together, this investigation is expected not only to advance the
fundamental understanding of sepsis pathology but also to evaluate whether targeting
GHS-R signal improves cardiac outcomes in sepsis, laying a scientific foundation for
future development of novel therapies."
10892293,"Abstract
 Despite extensive studies, environmental cues and signaling circuits regulating onset of autoimmune
diseases are not completely understood. Here we report that a receptor of the TGF-β cytokine family, Bone
Morphogenetic Protein Receptor 1α (BMPR1α, Alk-3) has important immunoregulatory functions. BMPR1α is
upregulated by activated effector and Foxp3+ regulatory CD4+ T cells (TR cells) and modulates functions of
both of these cell types. BMPR1α regulates inflammation by inhibiting generation of Th17 cells and sustaining
TR cells. Abrogation of BMPR1α signaling in TR cells resulted in a gradual loss of Foxp3 expression and
upregulation of transcription factors and cytokines specific for Th effector lineage including Rorgt, Batf, Hif1a,
IL-17 and IFN-g. This data suggests that BMPR1α controls phenotypic stability of TR cells and regulates
Th17/TR balance, critical for maintenance of peripheral tolerance and protection from autoimmune diseases.
Cells which downregulate Foxp3 convert into effector Th cells (exTR cells) which produce proinflammatory
cytokines and contribute to disease pathology in a number of autoimmune diseases. A recent RNA-seq
transcriptome analyses of BMPR1α-deficient TR cells in situ showed upregulation of a number of epigenetic
modifiers and transcription factors specific for effector Th cells including Med14, Supt16H, Setbp1, Tbx21
(Tbet) and Maf.
 These new data demonstrate that BMPR1α-deficient TR cells in unmanipulated mice are predisposed to
follow epigenetic and transcription programme to dedifferentiate to exTR cells when subject to antigenic
stimulation and inflammation.
 To gain mechanistic insight on the immunoregulatory role of BMPR1α we will combine ATAC-seq and RNA-
seq analyses of epigenetic profile and transcriptomes to identify molecules involved in TR/exTR transition.
 We will test if TR/exTR transition can be regulated by pharmacological modulation of BMPR1α dependent
signaling pathways. We have found that at the molecular level BMPR1a deficiency in TR cells led to
upregulation of Kdm6b (Jmjd3) demethylase, an antagonist of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). We will
examine if phenotype of BMPR1a deficient TR cells could be sustained by Kdm6b inhibitor. We will also
generate mouse models to test additional compounds for their ability to impact BMPR1a signaling and
modulate TR cell stability. In summary, proposed research will contribute to our understanding of
immunoregulation and has the potential to outline new therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and autoimmune
diseases."

The national suicide rate has grown by 30% over the last twenty years, and nearly 46,000 people died by
suicide in 2020. The rate of drug overdose death has grown even more dramatically over the same period.
Nearly 108,000 people died by drug overdose in 2021, an all-time high. Substance use and suicidal ideation
are strongly correlated. This overlap makes intent difficult for death investigators to classify in fatal drug
overdoses. Consequently, many overdose deaths ruled unintentional or “undetermined” may in fact be suicide
victims. This project will leverage data from death certificate, toxicology, police, and coroner/medical examiner
reports to investigate how medicolegal death investigators classify intent within fatal drug overdoses. The data
sample contains three states in a region with high rates of drug abuse and overdose death. With a mixed
methods approach of quantitative and linguistic analysis, the project will first identify which factors are most
predictive of intent classification. Potential factors include characteristics of decedents, death investigation
systems, and the socioeconomic conditions of communities. The principal data sources are the National
Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) and the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System
(SUDORS). Both sources contain decedent-level information. Whereas NVDRS contains intentional deaths by
drug poisoning (suicide), SUDORS contains unintentional (accidental) and “undetermined” deaths. The
combination of these sources will provide novel insight on suicidal intent among fatal drug overdoses. The
project will also develop a statistical adjustment to estimate underreported suicide deaths. This adjustment will
build from a model of suicide deaths by drug poisoning (in NVDRS) to estimate rates of underreported suicide
deaths in the unintentional and “undetermined” fatal overdose deaths (in SUDORS). The project will therefore
help identify populations in critical need of mental healthcare access and treatment. Furthermore, unintentional
drug overdose deaths and suicide deaths require a different set of prevention strategies and policies. Accurate
mortality surveillance systems are therefore central to either prevention effort. The analyses in this project will
inform points of intervention for death investigator instruction on the important classification of intent within fatal
drug overdoses."

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the major cell type of medium- and large-sized arteries, undergo
phenotypic switching in vascular diseases such as post-angioplasty restenosis and atherosclerosis.
Understanding the key players that promote VSMC plasticity will inform targeting strategies for downstream
signaling pathways and nuclear events effecting pathological changes in gene expression. Myocardin (MYOCD)
is a potent transcriptional coactivator of the VSMC differentiated state and loss of expression portends vascular
pathology. Despite the hundreds of papers describing MYOCD expression and activity in various contexts, its
transcriptional regulation in vivo is virtually unknown. I have discovered a binding site for Myeloid Ecotropic Viral
Integration Site 1 (MEIS1), a previously unrecognized transcription factor in VSMCs, in the 5’ promoter region of
Myocd, and preliminary studies show MEIS1 binding and transactivation of the Myocd gene. MEIS1 is reduced
in human VSMCs of atherosclerotic coronary arteries and transcriptomic profiling from Biobank of Karolinska
Endoarterctomy (BiKE) showed significant down-regulation of MEIS1 in plaques versus normal arteries as well
as in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients. To date, there has been only one report of MEIS1 in VSMCs
and nothing known beyond descriptive findings in pulmonary hypertension. Previous Meis1 loss-of-function and
protein expression studies have been difficult to interpret because of the lack of a true null mouse model and
faulty commercial antibodies. Preliminary studies below show an increased proliferation and migration of VSMCs
with loss of Meis1 function; gain-of-function studies reveal the maintenance of the contractile state. I have
generated a versatile mouse model representing the first true null Meis1 allele and its detection at the protein
level. An important component of my studies will be the utilization of a new VSMC-restricted Cre driver I have
helped characterize (Itga8-CRERT2) for more refined in vivo loss-of-function studies. Additional studies support
multiple enhancers that drive VSMC expression of Meis1. Collectively, the preliminary work support my
hypothesis that MEIS1 is a VSMC enriched transcription factor that promotes VSMC differentiation via
transactivation of Myocd. I propose to test this hypothesis in three aims over the course of this K99/R00 award.
The K99 Aim 1 will elucidate the VSMC phenotype with loss of endogenous MEIS1. R00 Aim 2 will elucidate the
transcriptional regulation of Myocd in vivo through an evolutionarily-conserved MEIS1-response element using
state-of-the-art genome editing in mice. R00 Aim 3 will elucidate the functional cis-regulome of MEIS1 in vascular
disease. Completion of the proposed studies will provide new insight into the contribution of MEIS1 to VSMC
differentiation and vascular homeostasis and the mechanistic regulation of Meis1 in vascular diseases.
Conceptual and experimental training related to multi-omics related research during the K99 phase will help me
pursue advanced MEIS1 studies as an independent investigator during my R00 phase and position me well for
my first R01 application."
10861079,"Abstract:
Could fusion between two disparate cell types generate an unconventional memory of infection? Would this
hybrid cell protect against tomorrow’s pandemics or promote neurodegeneration and cognitive decline? In virally
infected mice, we serendipitously discovered the presence of long-lived cellular fusions between astrocytes, a
major glial cell type in the central nervous system (CNS), and antiviral CD8+ T lymphocytes (T cells), which
infiltrate the CNS following an upper airway infection. Remarkably, these T cell/astrocyte hybrids retain the
cellular structure of an astrocyte but maintain gene expression only present in the T cell genome. While tissue-
resident memory T cells are known to remain in the CNS after infection, T cell/astrocyte fusions represent an
entirely novel cell fate that we consistently observe. This suggests that the transfer of genetic material from T
cells could represent a widespread phenomenon associated with astrocyte reactivity. Histological studies of
human brains have described hematopoietic fusions within the CNS, particularly in inflammatory settings, but
the driving forces, mechanisms, and implications are unknown. Human pathogens, including those that cause
upper respiratory infections (URI), directly infect or impact the CNS with symptoms ranging from mild
inflammation to overt encephalitis and have been associated with cognitive changes and neurodegeneration,
including “brain fog” associated with Influenza and Covid-19. These varying impacts on brain function are likely
multifactorial but regional alterations in CNS gene expression are readily observed in animal models. We
hypothesize that T cell/astrocyte hybrids represent a novel cell type possessing an engrained memory of
inflammation that contributes to inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. We will establish parameters

10875447,"Project Abstract: There is a fundamental need to understand the temporality of the mechanism for Vancomy-
cin Acute Kidney Injury (VAN AKI) because mechanistic knowledge to date has not led to safer care. However,
doing so requires serial biopsy and has been deemed impossible in traditional rodent experiments and unethi-
cal in humans. Our swine model of intubated, sedated, and paralyzed pigs offers physiologic and situational
similarity to human critical illness and further allows serial biopsy and moderate volume phlebotomy. Defining
the inciting mechanism will pave the way for AKI prevention studies that will precisely target: A) avoidance of
cellular accumulation such as through cellular uptake at the proximal tubule cell for vancomycin and many
other nephrotoxins, e.g., megalin mediated uptake or B) tubular conditions that minimize the likelihood of uro-
modulin complex formation, e.g., osmotic gradient management. The long-term goal of this research program
is to improve the kidney safety profile for critically necessary antibiotic therapies. Vancomycin (VAN) is an ex-
emplar study drug, as it is the most prescribed antibiotic in the hospital setting and causes kidney damage that
leads to excess morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this application are to: 1) define the mechanistic
temporality of VAN AKI so that prevention strategies can be focused later and 2) identify the metabolomic path-
ognomonic signature in blood that precedes VAN AKI. The central hypotheses in this proposal are that: 1)
temporality of the previously defined VAN AKI mechanisms is critically important, with the first event initiating a
chain reaction leading to toxicity. Identifying this ignition point will allow prevention strategies to be precisely
targeted, and 2) characterizing the blood metabolome will identify pathognomonic signatures that precede sus-
tained injury and will represent substantial improvements over the status quo monitoring approaches such as
serum creatinine or urinary biomarkers that are subject to variability from dilution. The rigor of prior research
demonstrates that: 1) VAN causes histopathologic kidney damage and changes to glomerular filtration rate. 2)
Our very small pilot data with three swine demonstrate promise for identifying metabolomic signatures that pre-
cede AKI. In this proposal, we AIM to 1) Determine the inciting mechanism and temporality of vancomycin AKI
in swine and classify the corresponding the changes in glomerular function and other gold standards and 2)
Characterize the blood metabolome of swine that develop and do not develop AKI. This project is innovative
as no previous approaches have been able to answer mechanistic temporality, and identifying blood metabo-
lomic signatures is likely to advance the status quo for timely kidney injury detection. Identification of early in-
jury is especially translational since it will be identified from a model that is physiologically and situationally sim-
ilar to the human condition of critical illness. These contributions will be significant because VAN kidney injury
is common with current approaches, and proposed methodologies are relevant to understanding other drugs
(e.g., polymyxin b and cisplatin) that cause AKI. Results from this proposal will lead to directed clinical trials."

 Relevance to public health. Microglia, the inflammatory cells in the brain and spinal cord, participate in the
development of neuropathic pain (NeuP) after nerve injury by releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
proinflammatory cytokines. NeuP affects >16 million Americans, is associated with a severe reduction in quality
of life. NeuP is often refractory to conventional analgesics, and opioids have only limited efficacy increasing the
risk of their misuse. Medications not typically used as analgesics are often the first-line treatment of NeuP. How-
ever, <50% of patients report pain relief with current treatment, and side effects are common. We offer evidence
that suppressing the voltage-gated proton channel (Hv1) in microglia can reduce inflammatory mediators release
and attenuate NeuP. We propose to identify small-molecule Hv1 blockers by high-throughput screening (HTS)
of plant extracts and botanical compounds as a step toward new drugs for NeuP.
 Brief background. This application builds on: (i) our publication that Hv1 controls ROS and proinflammatory
cytokines release in microglia and contributes to the development of NeuP, (ii) our preliminary finding that C6, a
designer peptide blocker of Hv1, suppresses ROS and proinflammatory cytokine release by microglia and atten-
uates NeuP after peripheral nerve injury in mice, and (iii) our successful pilot screening of a small compound
library and eight exemplar plant extracts using a novel live-cell, fluorescence-based HTS assay. The HTS assay
employs a pH-sensitive fluorescent protein genetically linked to the human Hv1 channel (hHv1-VFP-H148G),
allowing real-time monitoring of Hv1 operation and the identification of Hv1 blockers.
 Unique features and innovation. Our target choice is innovative because no clinically approved drugs se-
lectively target microglia and Hv1 lacks potent and specific small-molecule blockers. Our HTS assay is innovative
because there is no reported HTS method for proton channels. We identified unique reagents: C6 (the first
specific blocker of Hv1), C6 variants, F6 (a small molecule that inhibits Hv1 in the HTS), and Lavender (a plant
extract that inhibits Hv1 in the HTS) to facilitate the development, refinement, and validation of the HTS assay.
We will employ the HTS assay to screen a unique plant extract library with >1,500 species (with >15,000 esti-
mated compounds), many of which have been used historically for anti-inflammation and pain-relief.
 Three specific aims. (1) Optimize the HTS assay (R61 phase) seeks to improve and validate the HTS assay
for plant extracts and botanical compounds. (2) Select leads from a unique library of plant extracts (R33 phase)
seeks to screen the plant extracts library and identify potent and specific botanical Hv1 blockers. (3) Study sup-
pression of the microglial inflammatory response and NeuP with identified botanical Hv1 blockers (R33 phase)
seeks to validate the efficacy of identified botanical Hv1 blockers in microglia cells and a mouse model of NeuP.
 Significance. This work addresses an unmet medical need for NeuP therapeutics and has a broader influ-
ence because Hv1 in microglia is complicit in additional inflammatory disorders, such as ischemic stroke."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects 10 million people worldwide.
Its motor symptoms result from selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars
compacta, leading to a loss of their long-projecting axonal inputs to the striatum. Conventional cell therapy
involves implanting dopaminergic neurons into the striatum; however, this strategy disregards the important
systems-level implications of the native neuroanatomy. Pathway reconstruction strategies aim to address this
limitation by replacing both neurons and axonal fibers in a manner that restores the anatomy – and hence
circuit function – of the lost pathway. We have developed a reconstruction strategy whereby tissue-engineered
nigrostriatal pathways (TE-NSPs) are pre-fabricated in vitro featuring a population of human stem cell-derived
dopaminergic neurons and their long-projecting axonal tracts encased within a biocompatible tubular hydrogel.
TE-NSPs may be implanted to directly replace the pathway, supplying both dopaminergic neurons to the nigra
and providing axonal inputs to the striatum, thereby restoring crucial interconnectivity of the basal ganglia. In
this proposal, we will answer a fundamental and neglected question in cell therapy for PD by characterizing
whether pathway reconstruction with the TE-NSPs enables improved restoration of motor function compared to
conventional striatal grafts in a rat model of PD. Our overarching hypothesis is that TE-NSPs will lead to more
robust motor recovery than striatal grafts through a mechanism involving the reestablishment of physiological
innervation and striatal dopamine regulation patterns more closely matching those of native basal ganglia. This
hypothesis will be tested over three Aims: (1) Establish the ability of TE-NSPs to reconstruct basal ganglia
circuitry via axonal-dendritic synaptic integration; (2) Demonstrate real-time efficacy of TE-NSPs in restoring
nigrostriatal functionality; (3) Assess the influence of TE-NSP activity on motor recovery. TE-NSP mechanisms
and efficacy will be compared to hydrogel-encased nigral or striatal grafts, acellular hydrogel implants, as well
as non-implant and non-lesioned animals out to 24 weeks post-implantation. Motor function will be evaluated
with rotational, forelimb asymmetry and adhesive removal tests. Innervation and connectivity patterns will be
assessed with immunohistochemistry and monosynaptic rabies tracing, while ex vivo and in vivo voltammetry
and [18F]F-DOPA positron emission tomography will be used to analyze real-time dopamine release and
uptake in the striatum. We will also employ chemogenetics to silence neural activity in TE-NSPs to test the
effects on motor function. Overall, TE-NSPs address a crucial gap in clinical treatment by providing a means to
directly replace the nigrostriatal pathway, which may yield significant benefits over other methods by providing
properly-regulated dopamine in the striatum as characteristic of integrated basal ganglia circuitry. These
studies will further the long-term goal of advancing TE-NSPs as a Tissue Engineered Medical Product to
mitigate the neuronal-axonal loss underlying the motor symptoms in patients afflicted by PD."
10868714,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) has been recognized as an autoantigen (autoAg) in EAE and as
a putative T cell and antibody (Ab) target in MS. Recently, MOG has been identified as the target in several CNS
autoimmune conditions, including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), optic neuritis (ON), and
transverse myelitis (TM). Collectively, this spectrum is known as MOG Ab-associated disease (MOGAD).
Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for MOGAD. Key aspects regarding MOGAD pathogenesis
have not been elucidated. MOG-specific Abs in MOGAD are T cell-dependent and are not pathogenic in the
absence of T cell-mediated CNS inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that MOG-specific T cells have a
central role in MOGAD and cooperate with B cells, and possibly MOG-specific Abs, to promote CNS injury.
 MOG-induced EAE is an invaluable model to evaluate how MOG-specific T cells cooperate with MOG-
specific B cells and Abs in MOGAD. Like MOGAD, MOG-induced EAE manifests as ON, TM and
encephalomyelitis. Besides serving as a source of MOG-specific Abs, B cells are Ag presenting cells (APC). EAE
induction by MOG protein is B cell MHC II-dependent. Whether B cell Ag presentation promotes development
of a distinct pathogenic T cell repertoire is unknown. We hypothesize that B cell Ag presentation expands a unique
TCRa/b repertoire of MOG-specific pathogenic T cells. Susceptibility to MOG protein-induced EAE is sensitive
to certain human-specific amino acid (aa) sequence differences. Novel MOG T cell epitopes identified from
studying MOGAD patients are located within the region where many aa sequence differences are clustered. To
understand cellular and humoral responses to human MOG, and to better translate our findings, we created
humanized MOG knock-in mice by replacing mouse MOG genomic sequence with human genomic MOG.
 In this program, we propose: (1) To identify and characterize MOG-specific T cells in patients with distinct
MOGAD phenotypes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected from patients enrolled at three
collaborating institutions. MOG specificity will be determined by stimulation with overlapping MOG peptides
and TCRa/b repertoire will be examined by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). (2) In subaim 2a we will
determine how B cell Ag presentation in vivo may shape development of the pathogenic MOG-specific T cell
repertoire. T cells from wild-type, B cell-deficient and MOG-specific B cell receptor (BCR) mice immunized
with MOG protein (B cell-dependent) or MOG peptide (B cell-independent) will be subjected to TCRa/b repertoire
analysis by scRNA-Seq. In subaim 2b, our humanized MOG mice will be characterized for MOG-specific T cell
and humoral responses, and requirement for B cell-T cell cooperation in EAE. Serum MOG-specific Abs from
MOGAD patients will also be tested for pathogenic potential in recipient humanized MOG mice.
 Our results should provide invaluable knowledge regarding MOGAD pathogenesis and insights regarding B-
T cooperation in MOGAD and other organ-specific autoimmune diseases."

Some of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, are characterized by
chronic demyelination and a tissue environment that prevents efficient myelin repair and remyelination. While
cell therapies have the potential to promote remyelination and restore lost neurological function, major barriers
remain that hamper their successful translation to clinical treatment. Among these, survival of donor
oligodendrocytes cell (OPC) preparations and maintenance of OPC fate are key obstacles. Notably, more than
95% of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) transplanted into models of spinal cord injury die following injection 1,2,
while only 1-3% of NPCs survive when transplanted into ischemic tissue 3,4. The result of such excessive cell
death is the release of intracellular alloantigens, which likely exacerbate local inflammation and may predispose
the graft for eventual rejection. Indeed, following initial trials of glial cell replacement therapy in human congenital
hypomyelination, half of the subjects developed alloantibodies even in the context of prolonged
immunosuppression 5. In this proposal, we seek to address these major challenges. In aim 1, we will design,
synthesize and characterize a series of novel shear-thinning and bioactive hydrogels to promote survival and
minimize cell death when human (h)OPCs are subjected to shear stress during injection. In aim 2 we will use
the optimal shear-thinning hydrogel (STH) formulation to deliver cells into the corpus callosum of Shiverer/Rag2-
/- mice, a model of congenital hypomyelinating disease that has been widely accepted as the gold standard for
the assessment of myelinating cell preparations. In aim 3, we will employ a large animal model (rabbit) of
demyelination that we recently developed in our laboratories and better mimics the state of demyelinating
disease like multiple sclerosis. We will also design programmable (p)STH to retain hOPC at the site of injury and
control cell fate to maximize the myelogenic potential of transplanted cells into the injured rabbit brain. Overall,
this is a very innovative MPI proposal that combines state-of-the-art biomaterials, neuroscience and unique
animal models driven by the complementary expertise of two PIs, a bioengineer and a neuroscientist. Successful
attainment of our goals will likely lead to design of novel hydrogels and development of animal models that may
improve the potential of cell therapies for the treatment of devastating myelopathies."

 Osteoarthritis (OA) affects more than 50 million people in the US, eventually leading to chronic pain and
disability. Currently, no FDA-approved biomarkers for OA exist, limiting a clinician’s ability to detect early-
stage disease. Early detection of OA is a rate-limiting step toward improved clinical care because recent
studies show that early intervention can limit or reverse OA symptoms. However, early detection of OA is not
currently possible.
 Metabolomic profiling is an innovative approach to characterize biological systems like synovial joints.
While OA is classically described by degeneration of the articular cartilage, the pathophysiology of the disease
involves cell stress, inflammatory activity, and abnormal tissue metabolism. Since the synovial fluid contains
many of the molecules produced by the articular joint’s multiple cell types (eg chondrocytes, synoviocytes,
and osteoblasts), metabolic profiling of the synovial fluid could provide a unique window into active disease
processes in the OA-affected joint, and metabolomic profiles from synovial fluid could facilitate early detection
of OA.
 While synovial fluid is “the scene of the crime” for OA, plasma is easier to obtain clinically. Because
metabolites are smaller than 1000 Daltons, plasma metabolite profiles may also reflect OA pathophysiology,
and the goal of this proposal is to advance global metabolite profiles as clinical biomarkers of OA grade. Our
vision is to identify a panel of metabolite biomarkers that aid in the detection OA before the onset of symptoms.
 In Aim 1, metabolomic profiles of synovial fluid will be used with statistical learning to develop metabolite
biomarkers that predict both radiographic (e.g. KL-score) and symptomatic (e.g. pain) OA. The largest
available clinical cohort of human synovial fluid and plasma (n=1850, University of Oxford) will be used for
metabolite biomarker development, with model training, testing, and validation performed on a random
independent subsets. Because there is substantial heterogeneity in OA, molecular endotypes (i.e. molecular
OA profiles) will be developed from these metabolomic profiles that may yield important information on OA
pathophysiology. The cohort also contains paired plasma, and studies of Aim 2 will assess the correlations of
each metabolite between synovial fluid and plasma. Because plasma is easier to obtain, these correlations
will define which joint metabolites can be assessed in the circulatory compartment.
 The expected outcomes of this project are (1) a validated set of synovial fluid metabolite biomarkers that
predict OA grade and pain levels (2) identification of metabolomic endotypes of OA, and (3) assessment of
correlations between metabolite levels in the synovial fluid and the plasma. This will provide both clinicians
and basic scientists with improved information for diagnosing and treating debilitating osteoarthritis."

Comprehensive voice evaluation requires assessment of the essential subsystems, including the respiratory
subsystem. However, surveys of assessment and treatment practices by speech-language pathologists (SLPs)
both in and outside of the United States indicate that respiratory and aerodynamic measures are rarely used in
the assessment of voice disorders, mainly due to lack of access to expensive equipment. The proposed series
of studies seeks to overcome this serious deficiency in the voice assessment practice of SLPs by combining
concepts and techniques from clinical voice science, acoustics, statistical methods, and aerodynamic
engineering. The result will provide accurate, low-cost measures of respiratory capacity and phonatory airflow
via the development and validation of a uniquely designed vortex whistle and accompanying signal analysis
software. A vortex whistle is a non-mechanical, non-electronic device that provides a whistle frequency that
varies proportional to the inlet airflow rate. When frequency is mapped to the inlet airflow rate, the area under
the frequency-flow curve obtained from the vortex whistle can be used as an estimate of volume. Rather than a
replacement for spirometry and other pneumotachometer-based aerodynamic instrumentation, our vortex
whistle design is optimized to obtain accurate measures of vital capacity (VC) and mean phonatory airflow (PA)
in sustained voicing that have important application to the assessment of respiratory and laryngeal function
essential for effective voice production. The vortex whistle can be manufactured for a tiny fraction of the cost of
pneumotachometer-based or other aerodynamic instrumentation. In addition, the platform-independent
analysis software can be used with low-cost computers and can be easily translated to mobile platforms.
The specific goals of this project are to: (1) develop a more complete understanding of the acoustic-
aerodynamic capabilities of the vortex whistle via computational aeroacoustic (CAA) modeling, (2) assess
hardware and software analysis modifications that can optimize the ability to provide accurate VC and PA
estimates from the vortex whistle via physical aeroacoustic (PAA) modeling that incorporates an actuated
syringe methodology for the production of highly controlled and repeatable airflows and volumes, (3) compare
and correlate measures of VC and PA obtained via the vortex whistle system (VWS) with high-quality
pneumotachometer-based aerodynamic instrumentation including the Koko SX 1000 spirometer and the
Phonatory Aerodynamic System (PAS), (4) correlate voicing onset frequency-flow characteristics with
underlying driving pressure (Psub), and (5) demonstrate the VWS as a noninferior alternative to “gold”
standard pneumotachometer-based instrumentation for measures of VC and PA in groups of nondysphonic
subjects across the lifespan and as a treatment outcome measure in a group of unilateral vocal fold paralysis
(UVFP) patients pre- and post-surgical medialization."

In recent decades, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants associated with
a variety of traits and diseases, a critical first step towards understanding the molecular mechanisms that
underlie common health conditions. In many cases, however, the functions of GWAS genes, the mechanisms
and consequences of their dysfunction, or the relevant cell types in which their dysfunction manifests a
clinically significant phenotype remain poorly understood. The GWAS gene DSP encodes a junctional protein
found in desmosomes that provide structural integrity to epithelial cells in tissues that experience mechanical
stress, such as skin, heart, and lung. A variant associated with DSP expression in lung but not other tissues,
rs2076295, has been linked to both pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
susceptibility in GWAS. In recent years, we and others have developed protocols to differentiate, mature, and
model disease in human AT2s derived from iPSCs (iAT2s) and in preparation for this proposal we have
adapted this model system to interrogate lung disease-relevant GWAS discoveries. We hypothesize that
reductions in DSP mediated through rs2076295 destabilize desmosomes to regulate AT2 phenotypes through
modulation of Wnt/Tcf signaling either at homeostasis or in the setting of injury that impairs AT2 differentiation
capacity and induces a profibrotic mesenchymal phenotype. To test this hypothesis in this proposal, we will
test the mechanisms through which DSP regulates iAT2 maturation through CRISPR-based knockdown or
overexpression of DSP or its binding partners. We will identify the contribution of reduced DSP expression on
iAT2 transdifferentiation capacity and potential emergence of cells in a transitional state. We will then test the
contribution of DSP to AT2 regenerative capacity and associated fibrotic lung injury in vivo using AT2-specific
Dsp deletions in mice in combination with bleomycin injury. Finally, we will leverage LTRC data to determine
mechanisms through which rs2076295 regulates gene expression and then validate those predictions in
patient iAT2s."
10890843,"Summary
The long-term goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms of chaperone-mediated, protein
quality control (PQC). Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is known to bind client proteins and make the “decision” to
either fold or degrade them. How does Hsp70 make this choice? Why does it sometimes make the “wrong”
decision? Severe neurodegenerative disorders, including spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are associated with a failure of the Hsp70 system to adequately clear damaged
clients, such as polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor (polyQ-AR) and microtubule-associated protein tau
(MAPT/tau). We envision that mechanistic knowledge of Hsp70-mediated PQC will uncover new drug targets
that might be used to restore normal protein homeostasis and, ultimately, treat these diseases. Indeed, in the
previous funding cycles, we made substantial progress towards this goal. Specifically, we found that prolonged
binding of Hsp70 to polyQ-AR or MAPT/tau creates a “signal” that recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase, CHIP, and
triggers a degradation cascade. These new insight were revealed using our chemical probes that selectively
control protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Namely, we have developed molecules that inhibit PPIs between
Hsp70 and its major co-chaperones, the J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). In
the course of this R01 (2008-present), we have shipped these reagents to 100+ laboratories worldwide, enabling
important discoveries about the role of Hsp70 sub-networks in many biological models. Now, in this competitive
renewal, we are excited to propose the next generation of important mechanistic questions and PPI targets. In
preliminary studies, we identified which peptide sequences in polyQ-AR and MAPT/tau bind to Hsp70 and the
JDP, DnaJA2, a potent suppressor of aggregation Taking advantages of these insights and leveraging new
technical innovations, we propose to create “molecular glues” that promote selective and potent binding of polyQ-
AR and MAPT/tau to (SA1) Hsp70 and (SA2) DnaJA2. We also propose to (SA3) create “molecular glues” that
promote binding of Hsp70s and JDPs to each other. As envisioned, these drug-like compounds will stabilize PPI
contacts in the Hsp70 sub-network, promoting selective recognition of polyQ-AR and MAPT/tau and enhancing
their degradation. Thus, we anticipate that these new chemical probes could be the starting point for exciting,
new therapeutics. There is considerable enthusiasm for “molecular glues” in oncology and we are enthusiastic
about taking the lessons (and technologies) from that emerging field and applying them in new ways to probe
Hsp70 sub-networks in models of neurodegeneration. More fundamentally, we expect that these studies will
reveal the molecular logic by which Hsp70 systems conduct PQC and maintain protein homeostasis."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Up to 30% of patients may be
eligible for surgical resection for treatment. Currently, however, more than half of patients undergoing lung
cancer resection are older adults (≥65 years) and 70% of thoracic surgery patients are “pre-frail” or
“frail.” Frailty portends poor perioperative outcomes, such as increased postoperative complications,
length of stay, hospital costs, post-discharge institutionalization and mortality. The American College of
Surgeons and other international societies recommend frailty mitigation by offering patients prehabilitation
(prehab) programs that focus on exercise, nutrition, and social support. Yet, despite evidence of efficacy in
clinical trials, only 10-30% of patients actually adhere to prehab programs and the translation of these
programs into clinical practice has been challenging. In our pilot study of BeFitMe™, a prehab smartphone
application that provides, encourages, and tracks self-guided at-home exercise, based on the National
Institute of Aging Go4Life exercise videos, only 14% of patients downloaded the app. However, those who did
download the app averaged 38 ± 8.8 minutes of daily exercise, 1,862 ± 2000 steps per day, and 11.9 ±4.3
days of prehab activity; non-users were more likely to be older, male, and Black. Lack of robust “end-user”
input into intervention design, particularly behavioral interventions, can lead to poor acceptability and
adherence. Indeed, we are unaware of any current prehab program that applied a user-centered design
approach to fully ascertain and address the specific needs, values, and preferences of the end-users,
particularly older adults. Furthermore, no programs report using implementation science principles to introduce
and adapt the intervention to varied clinical contexts. As a Stage I study in the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral
Intervention Development, we propose to (1) Gather end-user (patients, caregivers, clinicians) perspectives
and engage them as co-designers to redesign and enhance BeFitMe™ to increase its use and participation
among older adults undergoing lung cancer surgery and (2) Use an implementation framework to increase
reach, adoption, and sustainability of the prehab program. To achieve my immediate goal of enhancing the
existing prehab app to optimize its use by prefrail/frail older adult lung cancer patients who will undergo
resection, I have convened a team of experts in user-centered design, implementation science, qualitative
research, prehab, geriatric oncology, lung cancer, and thoracic surgery. My long-term goal is to become an
independent investigator focused on optimizing the pre-hospital, in-hospital, and post-hospital phases of
surgical care for prefrail/frail older adults with lung cancer."
10891726,"Project Summary Vascular malformations (VMs) are resulted from developmental abnormalities
in vasculatures including veins, arteries, capillaries, and lymphatic vessels. Treatment of VMs is
a big challenge due to the large variety of lesion types, complexity of symptoms, and limited
interventional options, which results in unsatisfied therapeutic outcomes. Port Wine Birthmarks
(PWB) is one of the most common types of VMs. It mainly appears on the face and can be highly
associated with Sturge Weber Syndrome (SWS) with brain blood vessels’ involvement and
seizure disorders. One long-term obstacle to our understanding of the disease causes of PWB
and the therapeutic development for it has been a lack of clinically relevant cell and animal models.
In this proposal, we will take advantages of utilizing our current advancements in the generation
of PWB-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) and their differentiated lineages such as
endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular spheroids/organoids (VSs). VSs derived from PWB show
larger diameters, longer lengths, and more tortuous branches as compared to the VSs derived
from normal IPSCs. In addition, such vascular phenotypes can be reproduced in vivo after an
implantation of spheroids/organoids into the mouse skin. These proof-of-principle and feasibility
studies let us propose to develop in vitro and in vivo clinically relevant cell and organoid models
derived from PWB patient’s IPSCs and validate them subsequently. For evaluation of in vitro cell
and organoid models, we will perform a series of molecular and phenotypic characterizations of
ECs and VSs derived from PWB IPSCs as compared to normal IPSCs. Furthermore, next
generation sequencing approaches will be used to explore and integrate the molecular, epigenetic,
and signaling pathway profiles that underlie the abnormal cell-fate and lineage-specification in
PWB. These molecular pathological features will be further validated with PWB skin lesions. For
evaluation of the in vivo model, we will implant VSs into skins in mice, monitor and characterize
the dynamics of the vasculature formation and remodeling. We will determine the recapitulated
PWB pathologies in this in vivo model as compared to the existing data from PWB skin lesions.
The project is highly innovative as it aims to develop clinically relevant and paradigm-shift cell and
organoid models for mechanistic and therapeutic studies of PWB. The use of patient-derived
IPSCs, ECs, and VSs are unprecedented; the data is translational. These models are not only a
significant evolution in disease model development for understanding of pathological
characteristics of PWB, but also a substantial advancement in development of a novel platform
for clinical therapeutic studies."
10840864,"Chronic vascular inflammation is a hallmark of atherosclerosis, pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH) and related conditions. It is also one of the principal causes of endothelial-
to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). We have recently demonstrated that disruption of EndMT,
achieved by inhibiting endothelial-specific TGFβ signaling input, results in extensive (~70%)
regression of established atherosclerotic lesion and prevention of development of new ones. It
also prevents development of hypoxia-induced PAH. These data suggest that EndMT is key to
the development and progression of illnesses associated with chronic inflammation, such as
atherosclerosis, PAH, and transplant arteriopathy.
 However, a therapeutic strategy that relies on suppressing EndMT via control of endothelial
TGFβ signaling is complicated because of the need of endothelial-specific delivery of
therapeutic agents (systemic inhibition of TGFβ signaling is fraught with side effects and has
been shown to promote atherosclerosis via its effects on smooth muscle cells). For these
reasons, we focused on identifying another EndMT control point that can serve as an effective
therapeutic target. Since endothelial cells have unique metabolic requirements and pathways,
we concentrated on identifying potential metabolic-related control of EndMT.
 Our preliminary studies indicate that there indeed is metabolic control of EndMT that
operates via acetylation-dependent regulation of TGFβ signaling. Moreover, the Ac-CoA needed
for these acetylation events appears to be in large part derived atypically from acetate. Our goal
in this application is to rigorously define and characterize the unique endothelial metabolic
pathway that leads to generation of cytoplasmic Ac-CoA from acetate and the role that this Ac-
CoA plays in TGFβ signaling. This will be tested in vitro and in vivo using genetically engineered
mice. Finally, we will test two distinct translational strategies – a nanoparticle-based EC-specific
RNAi delivery, and an oral specific inhibitor to test the effect of suppression of acetate-based
Ac-CoA production on the development and progression of atherosclerosis"

Cortical activity changes dramatically upon changes in behavioral state of an animal with different behavioral states, such
as sleep and wake, having profound impact on cortical processing. The circuitry responsible for sensing behavioral state
and modifying cortical activity to generate cortical states remains unknown. However, inhibitory neurons (INs) have been
recently implicated in this role. Interestingly, both dysregulation of behavioral states and disruptions in INs are hallmarks
of major neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, I propose that a specific sub type of inhibitory neuron in the cortex plays a role
in the generation of low-frequency oscillations, a hallmark of multiple cortical states. I propose that the long-range inhibitory
neurons of the cortex play a crucial role in the generation of low-frequency oscillations.
Long-range inhibitory neurons are highly distinct from other cell types in the cortex both in terms of their morphology and
gene expression. While other INs in the cortex project locally, long-range inhibitory neurons project across many
millimeters, in the mouse, and across cortical areas. Previous studies of the connectivity of these cells have been hampered
by the necessity to slice tissue and fill cells to generate morphologies limiting our knowledge of these cells. In my first aim,
I plan to address these issues using tissue clearing and light sheet microscopy to determine the postsynaptic areas targeted
by these cells. I will compliment this with 2-photon recordings of the activity of these cells performed across behavioral
states to determine the activity patterns affecting downstream areas.
In my second aim, I will perform in vivo function characterizations of long-range inhibitory neurons using optogenetics and
electrophysiology. Ex-vivo studies suggest that long-range inhibitory neurons are active during slow wave sleep, a period
of low-frequency oscillations. I will perform in vivo extracellular electrophysiology while using optogenetic tools to
manipulate the activity of long-range inhibitory neurons. I will use excitatory opsins with frequency modulated stimulation
and an inhibitory opsin. I will measure the responses of single units and network oscillations to this stimulation. I will
perform manipulations in long-range inhibitory neurons and other neuronal types to show specificity of results testing the
hypothesis that these cells regulate the generation of low-frequency oscillations.
Together these two aims provide the first in vivo characterizations of the activity of long-range inhibitory neurons. When
completed, I will be able to relate the connectivity, morphology, and activity patterns of this cell type to understand the role

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality among American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN), and
AI/AN have worse lung cancer incidence rates, survival, and death compared to the general population.
Because lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been shown to reduce
lung cancer mortality by roughly 20%, the United States Preventive Services Task Force now recommends
LCS for men and women aged 55-80 years who meet specific eligibility criteria (grade-B evidence), and
subsequently the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) opted to cover this test. However, the
uptake of LCS implementation has been slow in most healthcare systems, and LCS implementation among
AI/AN has never been studied. To address this knowledge and implementation gap, we prose the “Tribally
Engaged Approaches to Lung Screening (TEALS)” study, which is a collaborative effort between the Choctaw
Nation of Oklahoma, the Stephenson Cancer Center, and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center
that directly addresses the low uptake of LCS in tribal settings through the development of a theory-driven LCS
implementation program within the Choctaw Nation Health Services Authority (CNHSA). Over the course of 5
years, TEALS will: 1) Conduct focus groups and semi-structured interviews with CNHSA patients, clinicians,
and health administrators to elucidate individual- and system-level barriers and facilitators that affect the
implementation of LCS; 2) Develop, and iteratively refine an LCS care coordination intervention that will identify
eligible persons for LCS, help these patients navigate the screening process, and link them with smoking
cessation services, when applicable; 3) Measure the impact of the TEALS intervention on the receipt of
screening and a set of patient- and practice-level outcomes by conducting a cluster-randomized clinical trial of
LCS implementation; and 4) Disseminate the TEALS program to other researchers and healthcare systems
that serve AI/AN patients. TEALS will bridge the gap between evidence and clinical practice for LCS in a high-
need, low-resource setting by intervening at the level of the healthcare system. System-level interventions for
guideline implementation tend to be understudied compared to those evaluating individual-level, behavioral
interventions. However, the careful development and evaluation of an LCS screening program at the level of
the healthcare system would be critical to ensure that more patients can receive LCS when appropriate.
Through TEALS, our research will create a critically needed platform from which future studies could be
launched that will examine how to tailor the application of the LCS guideline to the individual preferences of
AI/AN patients. TEALS will establish an effective LCS program in a tribal system and thus provide a direct
benefit to the Choctaw Nation by increasing LCS participation. TEALS will serve as a blueprint for establishing
a sustainable and accessible infrastructure for LCS in AI/AN and other community health systems. By
increasing screening for early stage lung cancer, TEALS could ultimately reduce lung cancer mortality in AI/AN
communities, many of which are in great need of effective strategies to reduce longstanding cancer disparities."

 In this MOSAIC K99/R00 Pathway to Independence application, Dr. Brian O’Grady proposes training in
models of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and development of therapeutics that will strategically compliment
his expertise in the development of arteriole-specific growth of ex vivo brain tissue in a biomimetic hydrogel and
3D printed microfluidic fabrication. The training plan is paired with scientific studies that will develop and apply a
novel microfluidic device for modeling subarachnoid hemorrhage stroke events and for use as a screening
platform for a dual-targeted nanoparticle as a potential therapeutic for the damage caused by SAH and delayed
cerebral ischemia. Dr. O’Grady’s primary goal is to become an independent researcher focused on
creating biomimetic in vitro models of the brain vasculature and developing novel therapeutics for
neurological diseases. The rigorous training described and the outstanding team of mentors in vascular biology
(Dr. Lippmann), neurological disease pathology (Dr. Jefferson), and nanoparticle development and therapeutics
(Dr. Duvall) will ensure his success in transitioning to independence. Through his training plan, Dr. O’Grady will
gain 1) deeper knowledge of blood-brain barrier physiology and the neurovascular unit; 2) experience
synthesizing and characterizing nanoparticles; 3) knowledge of modeling SAH and neurological disorders in
vitro; and 4) strategies for running a successful interdisciplinary and collaborative research lab.
 SAH is defined as a cerebrovascular disease with the initial event of a ruptured brain aneurysm and accounts
for 5% of all types of strokes. Despite this small percentage, SAH accounts for one third of all stroke-related
years of potential life lost before the age of 65. While a new era of neurocritical care management has contributed
to improved outcomes for SAH, the secondary consequences result in delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). DCI has
varying degrees of patient functional outcome and has no known interventions to improve quality of life. This
lack of effective treatments is largely attributed to the high failure rate of translating brain-targeting drugs from
animals to humans. Recently, there has been a global effort to produce a tissue engineered, in vitro model
system that can represent the complex vascular anatomy and microenvironment of the neurovascular unit. Dr.
O’Grady’s preliminary work demonstrates that a novel biomimetic hydrogel supports induced pluripotent stem
cell-derived neural, mural, and glial cells and induces arteriole-specific growth of ex vivo human brain
vasculature. This new vasculature consists of anatomically correct, concentric layered structures that were
previously unobtainable. When supported by a microfluidic device, the arterioles anastomose and can be lumen-
perfused and photoablated. Based on his preliminary data, Dr. O’Grady hypothesizes that the dynamic
neurovascular microenvironment of a stroke-like event can be accurately modeled by this new in vitro system.
In addition to developing a new in vitro model of SAH, this project will test and validate the neural protective
efficacy of a dual-targeted therapeutic for SAH and DCI in the human in vitro model."
10895536,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
People with disabilities experience pregnancy at the same rate as people without disabilities but have
disproportionately higher rates of adverse outcomes including pregnancy, labor and delivery complications,
severe maternal morbidity, maternal death, preterm birth, stillbirth, low birth weight, and infant mortality rates.
Although there is limited information about the extent of racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and newborn
health outcomes among those who are disabled, current evidence suggests that these inequities are even
more pronounced among racial and ethnic minorities compared to their White counterparts. Developing
effective interventions to eliminate inequities at the intersection of race, ethnicity, and disability requires a
comprehensive understanding of the relationships between these multiple levels of inequity and associated
birth outcomes. This project aims to fill this research gap using a social determinants of maternal health lens to
analyze linked maternal-infant Medicaid claims, natality, and mortality data files. Three research aims are
proposed. Aim 1 focuses on the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in low birthweight, small for
gestational age, preterm birth, and neonatal mortality at the intersection with disability; Aim 2 evaluates the
extent to which disparities in these outcomes at the intersection of race, ethnicity, and disability are moderated
by area-level socioeconomic inequities; and Aim 3 evaluates the association between race, ethnicity, and
disability in nationally established quality measures for maternal-infant health. The proposed aims are
supported by the PI’s career training goals, which include developing expertise in 1) using Medicaid claims
data to produce measures of adverse birth outcomes by race, ethnicity, and disability, 2) analyzing area-level
social determinants and quality of care measures associated with maternal and newborn health disparities, and
3) understanding disability measurement, public insurance coverage, risk factors for poor health, and
community priorities needed to design effective interventions to reduce maternal and infant health inequities in
this population. The proposed project supports the PI’s long-term career goal to become an independent
investigator and advocate for maternal and newborn health equity in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on
identifying and addressing the disparities resulting from social inequities using rigorous methodologies. Career
development will include a series of formal courses, training workshops, and directed readings that will be
completed with faculty at Dartmouth and other institutions over the first two years with additional topics covered
as needed in the subsequent years. Attendance at conferences and related workshops will also be added to
stay informed of current developments in the field. The award will be followed with a Research Project Grant
(R01) to develop and test an intervention to improve outcomes among those most burdened by adverse
outcomes at the intersection of race, ethnicity, and disability in the U.S."
10919822,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Most adolescents (61-88%) who present to treatment with alcohol use disorder (AUD) have a co-occurring
psychiatric diagnosis. Youth with AUD and a co-occurring diagnosis exhibit poorer general functioning and
worse treatment outcomes compared to those with AUD alone. Unfortunately, treatments for adolescent AUD
lag behind those for adults and show small effect sizes. To improve interventions for this population, there is a
need to understand how and why adolescent AUD treatments work and to identify transdiagnostic treatment
mechanisms that can target symptoms of multiple disorders simultaneously. Emotion regulation skill use is one
such mechanism. This proposal leverages ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to study the change in
emotion regulation skill use within a treatment context as well as examine its influence on relevant AUD and
co-occurring disorder treatment outcomes. The proposed research will examine these processes within a
community sample of adolescents (aged 13-18) undergoing an intensive outpatient program for AUD and co-
occurring disorders. Given the cost and labor-intensive resources required for EMA research and the little work
using EMA with this population, the K99 project will consist of a pilot study to test the feasibility and
acceptability of the EMA protocol, will identify barriers to compliance, and will refine the protocol. (Aims 1a-1c).
The R00 project (N = 80 adolescents) will consist of a 10-week study during which participants will complete
two 3-week bursts of EMA reports. Aims of the R00 project are to examine prospective momentary
associations between emotion regulation skill use and momentary treatment outcomes (Aim 2), to characterize
the extent of change in emotion regulation skill use across treatment (Aim 3a) and examine whether changes
in emotion regulation skill use coincide with changes in treatment outcomes across treatment (Aim 3b).
Findings will serve as pilot data to a larger NIAAA R01 grant submission in this area of work. Importantly, this
K99/R00 application will serve as foundational training for Dr. Jenzer's development as an independent
scientist. Mentors (Drs. Miranda, Magill, Weiss, Litt) are committed to the candidate's training and each will
provide unique expertise to the research and training plan."
10862838,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) are among the primary
causes of health burden worldwide. MDD is a leading cause of disability associated with increased morality
risk, and both MDD and GAD result in considerable economic costs, loss of functioning, and decreased quality
of life. One of the biggest challenges in responding to current calls for population-level screening is to monitor
MDD and GAD at a large scale while minimizing assessment burden. Existing assessment methods, however,
rely on subjective measures, are based on diagnostic approaches, and are burdensome in the extent needed
to characterize MDD and GAD in their heterogeneity, which would require combined evaluation of all
symptoms. New methods are needed to accurately assess behavioral health, overcome barriers to monitoring
and care, and advance the scientific understanding of depression and anxiety.
 The proposed study aims to address these gaps by deconstructing MDD and GAD into Digital
Biomarkers (DB) based on linguistic features identified by large language models. State of the art artificial
intelligence and Natural Language Processing methods allow representation learning of DB from cognitive and
emotional domains captured from linguistic information. While effective, passive, and at-scale monitoring are
the primary benefits of DB, we will also use them to study relevant Research Domain Criteria (RDoC),
including negative valence system reactions and positive valence traits. The study goals are to: 1) Design DB
of MDD and GAD symptoms using deep learning methods, by training an attention-based language model on a
very large corpus of de-identified psychotherapy treatment transcripts; 2) Examine preliminary performance
and feasibility of the DB model in a highly characterized sample of MDD and GAD patients, and compare
results with clinician ratings; 3) Explore improvements to the DB model based on research paradigms
consistent with RDoC constructs, to further refine DB model pipeline and future deployment in clinical settings.
 The program of research and training described in this mentored patient-oriented research career
development award is aimed at developing systematic digital health approaches to allow dimensional
conceptualization of MDD and GAD consistent with RDoC, enhancing the ease and consistency of detection to
ultimately support targeted interventions. The proposed project is strongly supported by a multidisciplinary
team including the mentorship of Drs. Naomi Simon and Kyunghyun Cho, and the domain expertise of Drs.
Paul Glimcher, Tim Althoff, Zhe Chen, and Tanzeem Choudhury. The experience gained from the award will
enable the pursuit of future R-level studies focusing on advanced computational psychiatry approaches to
further refine DB models to improve passive and objective assessment of behavioral health, and ultimately
improve our empirical understanding of depression and anxiety."
10890865,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Chronic inflammatory diseases afflict millions of Americans and place devasting burdens
on patient’s lives. Effective treatments for these disorders are lacking, partly because the multicellular
interactions between bodily systems (e.g. the peripheral nervous and immune systems) that drive inflammation
are poorly understood. For example, it is known that sensory neurons play context-dependent roles in a variety
of inflammatory disorders by modulating the immune response. The specific neuronal subtypes and molecular
mechanisms that contribute to this remain unclear. The overarching goal of my research is to unravel the precise
mechanisms by which peripheral sensory neurons influence the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases of the
skin and visceral organs and how sensory neurons are in turn influenced by the immune system. A subtype of
sensory neuron that detects itch (pruriceptors), expresses a number of receptors for pro-inflammatory and
immunomodulatory molecules. Thus, these pruriceptors are attractive candidates for orchestrating multicellular
interactions during inflammation. However, the role of these specific sensory neurons in inflammatory disease is
unstudied as, until recently, the tools to precisely target these neurons were lacking. To bridge this gap in
knowledge, this proposal will elucidate the contribution of pruriceptors to distinct inflammatory states. The
proposed research will interrogate pruriceptor function using genetic and viral approaches in mouse models to
selectively target and ablate these neurons and measure the effects of these manipulations on mouse models
of inflammatory diseases. Specifically, I will test the hypothesis that pruriceptors, as polymodal sensors of
aversive chemical, mechanical, and immune stimuli, drive hypersensitivity and local inflammatory responses in
a context-specific manner. During the K99 phase, I will leverage my proven track record in studying neuroimmune
interactions with innovative techniques I am learning to target and manipulate specific subsets of sensory
neurons and ultimately map and elucidate multicellular circuits in inflammation. Aim 1 will establish th e
contributions of pruriceptors to chronic itch-evoked skin inflammation by combining viral and genetic approaches
to selectively ablate pruriceptors with behavioral, immunological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic read-
outs to understand how pruriceptors contribute to skin inflammation. As molecularly similar sensory neurons of
unknown function also innervate the gut, Aim 2 will translate this approach to the study of gastrointestinal tract
inflammation and gut function using a model of gastritis. I will dedicate part of the K99 phase to career
development activities such as mentoring, presenting at conferences, and publishing research articles. A portion
of both Aims will carry over into the independent R00 phase of the award. This proposal will provide fundamental
insights into the multicellular interactions underlying chronic inflammatory disease from a neuron-focused
perspective. Successfully executing this training plan with the help of The Scripps Research Institute will prepare
me to lead an independent research program."
10849821,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Excessive intravascular hemolysis of red blood cells (RBCs) leads to numerous complications associated with
uncontrolled inflammation including pain, vaso-occlusion, and organ damage that underlie the pathophysiology
of several disease states including sepsis, intravascular hemorrhage, and sickle cell disease (SCD). The primary
mediator of this inflammation is heme released from damaged RBCs. The applicant’s goup recently reported
that heme activates the inflammatory caspases, caspase-1, caspase-4, and caspase-5 to coordinate the
cleavage and release of the apical pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Importantly, unlike caspase-1, caspase-4
and caspase-5 are activated independently of inflammasome assembly. Thus, heme is one of the first examples
of a DAMP (damage associated molecular pattern) that activates the non-canonical inflammasome pathway.
The applicant has shown that heme binds caspase-4 and caspase-5 and induces oligomerization of these
caspases. The central hypothesis is that heme directly binds to caspase-4 and caspase-5 to induce
oligomerization and activation. The hypothesis will be tested by the following Aims: 1) to determine the
biophysical composition of heme-induced inflammatory caspase complexes and 2) to identify the protein
components required for heme-induced inflammatory caspase activation. Under the first Aim full length
recombinant caspase proteins will be produced and the ability of heme to bind caspases and to induce caspase
oligomerization and cleavage will be assessed. Under the second aim the amino acid residues required for heme
binding, oligomerization and cleavage will be identified as well as the type of cytosolic factors, if any, contribute
heme-induced caspase activation. This work will provide an in vitro assay that will be the basis for future rational
drug design approaches and a source of purified caspases that can be used for future studies to determine the
structures of the heme-induced caspase complexes. Understanding the mechanisms of inflammatory caspase
activation with provide justification for targeting these proteins to improve clinical outcomes in hemolytic
conditions."
10867462,"Project Summary
 Clostridium perfringens type A strains cause 80-90% of all cases of gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis),
which involves infection of muscle. Gas gangrene is nearly 100% fatal unless promptly treated, which often in-
volves amputation of limbs. Even with treatment, this infection still causes 67% mortality in diabetics. However,
only a small percentage of wounds infected with C. perfringens progress to gas gangrene, highlighting the im-
portance of host factors in this disease. A well-recognized host risk factor for gas gangrene is type 1 or 2 diabetes.
 The basis for the association between C. perfringens gas gangrene and diabetes is incompletely understood.
However, we detected strongly upregulated expression of the C. perfringens brnQ2 gene encoding a branched
chain amino acid (BCAA) transporter when a type A strain was co-cultured with C2C12 differentiated muscle
cells. We hypothesize that this observation helps to explain why diabetics are more prone to develop gas gan-
grene. This hypothesis is supported by additional facts. First, C. perfringens cannot synthesize its own BCAAs
so, to grow, this bacterium must obtain these amino acids from the host using a BCAA transporter(s). Second,
clinical studies found that diabetics (both type 1 and type 2) have elevated BCAA levels in their blood and, likely,
muscle cells. Therefore we postulate that, during gas gangrene (particularly in diabetics), C. perfringens growing
in muscle uses a BCAA transporter(s) to take-up BCAAs from blood and/or toxin-damaged muscle cells.
 To test our hypothesis and identify which BCAA transporter(s) are important for C. perfringens growth and
survival in gas gangrene-relevant environments, Aim 1 will evaluate C. perfringens growth and survival in gas
gangrene-relevant blood or the presence of toxin-damaged differentiated C2C12 muscle cells. First, C.
perfringens type A strain ATCC3624 null mutants unable to produce the toxins involved in gas gangrene (i.e.,
perfringolysin O and alpha toxin) will be compared against wild-type ATCC3624 for their growth/survival using,
and ability to release BCAAs from, C2C12 cells. If viable bacterial numbers and BCAA release are less for the
toxin mutants, they will be complemented and re-assayed to rule out secondary mutation effects. Aim 1 will then
use the brnQ2 null mutant and a complementing strain to assess BrnQ2’s role in BCAA uptake and its importance
for ATCC3624 growth/survival using blood or toxin-damaged C2C12 cells. Similar studies will be performed
using ATCC3624 mutants unable to produce brnQ or brnQ3, which encode the other two BCAA transporters of
C. perfringens. Aim 2 will evaluate whether BKSdb/db mice (a mouse model for type 2 diabetes that has high
blood BCAA levels) are more susceptible than normal mice for developing gas gangrene. This Aim will then use
the Aim 1 BrnQ-family null mutants and complementing strains to identify which of those BCAA transporter(s)
are important contributors to gas gangrene in diabetic and/or normal mice. If our hypothesis is verified, and a
BCAA transporter(s) involved in gas gangrene virulence is identified, that BCAA transporter(s) could be a
potential target for inhibitor development that could improve gas gangrene therapy."
10885191,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Senescence is a state of permanent cell cycle arrest, and can occur during development (programmed
senescence), or be triggered by a variety of stressors, like telomere shortening (defined as replicative
senescence), oxidative stress DNA damage, and oncogene activation (stress-induced premature senescence).
Senescent cells remain metabolically active and secrete high concentrations of signaling molecules into the
tissue microenvironment (known as Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype, or SASP). These secreted
factors can activate immune systems to initiate clearance of senescent cells, which contribute to tumor
suppression, would healing and tissue homeostasis. When the immunosurveillance fails to eliminate senescent
cells, their accumulation causes inflammation and contributes to a variety of diseases, including cancer,
metabolic disorders, fibrosis, diabetes, brain disorders, osteoarthritis, and kidney disease.
 These complex and important roles in ageing and diseases prompt extensive interest in developing
imaging methods to detect senescence cells. A number of optical imaging probes have been developed by
targeting senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-b-gal) activity. However, their use in vivo is limited
due to poor penetration and scattering photons in living tissues. Several SPECT, MRI, and PET probes have
been reported to address this limitation, but they displayed either poor cell permeability and/or sensitivity. In
the case of PET tracers, they generally suffer from a lack of efficient signal retention mechanism.
 This research proposes to develop a novel PET tracer for in vivo imaging of senescence in a mouse
model of cancer by targeting a novel lysosomal enzyme and using an in celluo probe assembly retention
strategy. There are two Specific Aims: 1) synthesize the PET tracer and assess its capacity to detecting
senescence in cell culture; 2) validate the PET tracer in animal models of therapy induced senescence. This
project would provide a more specific and sensitive PET tracer for imaging cell senescence in vivo and for
future translation into human studies."

This new R61/R33 application responds to NOT-NS-22-095: “Development and Validation of Pain-Related
Models and Endpoints to Facilitate Non-Addictive Analgesic Discovery.” In 2017, the National Institutes of Health
launched the HEAL initiative, and one major goal of this initiative has been to develop new, non-addicting
analgesics. Analgesic drug discovery depends on preclinical models of pain and analgesia for early-stage
evaluation of candidate therapeutics, but conventional models that rely on reflex-withdrawal responses elicited
by thermal or mechanical stimuli have significant deficits in face and predictive validity. To address these deficits,
we have spent more than a decade developing and refining novel behavioral endpoints that focus on pain-related
depression of normal behavior. Assays of pain-depresse behavior improve face validity because behavioral
depression and functional impairment are cardinal signs of pain diagnosis, and restoration of normal function
and behavior is often a major goal of pain treatment. These assays also significantly improve predictive validity
by eliminating false-positive effects with drugs that produce motor impairment. This application seeks funding
for further validation of a new procedure for use in mice that measures unconditioned locomotor activity in a
complex environment as a new type of assay for pain-depressed behavior. Preliminary data suggest that the
procedure elicits high and replicable baseline behavior, reliable depression by an acute visceral pain stimulus,
and reversal of pain effects by clinically effective analgesics as positive controls but not by two prominent classes
of non-analgesics as negative controls. The procedure also has attributes to promote replicability of results,
efficiency of experimental design, assessment of sex as a biological variable, and quantitative objectivity of data
collection. Proposed studies for further validation would proceed in two phases. In the first R61 phase (Year 1),
we propose further studies to meet three milestones. (1) Further validate our procedure with additional positive
and negative controls against our visceral acute pain model. (2) Evaluate selectivity of drug effects to restore
behavioral depression by acute pain in comparison to behavioral depression by a non-pain treatment (lithium
chloride). (3) Evaluate sensitivity of behavioral endpoints to models of more sustained cutaneous and visceral
inflammatory pain (intraplantar complete Freund’s adjuvant, Ipl CFA; post-surgical abdominal-incision, AI). In
the second R33 phase (Years 2-3), we propose to collaborate with colleagues at VCU and Wake Forest
University to scale up and extend the model in three ways. (1) Extend from ICR outbred mice to an inbred strain
commonly used to generate gene-altered mice (C57BL/6J). (2) Extend to three additional disease models of
chronic pain (mononeuropathy pain using spared nerve injury, SNI; irritable bowel disease, IBD; sickle-cell
anemia, SCA). (3) Evaluate independent replication of key results at a partner academic institution (Wake Forest
University). Successful completion of the project would provide a comprehensive empirical foundation for broad
use of this procedure in efforts to discover non-opioid non-addicting analgesic drugs."

10851942,"SUMMARY
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin condition that paradoxically increases the risk of skin infections.
The most common bacterial infection of clinical significance is Staphylococcus aureus, while the herpes
viruses herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) greatly affect quality of life and can lead to
severe infections requiring hospitalization. While it is known that AD dysregulates the barrier function of the
skin, how this impacts immunity against microbial pathogens is poorly understood. Improved insight into how
immune mechanisms in the skin are initiated and resolved may underpin future development of preventive and
therapeutic strategies.
Interleukin-36 (IL-36) represents IL-36a, IL-36b and IL-36g, which are related to IL-1a and IL-1b. Elevated IL-
36 levels are associated with S. aureus colonization and severe AD. Using HSV1 as a model herpes virus, we
published studies on the roles IL-1 and IL-36 play in initiating protective immune responses. Additional data
from our lab identified critical activities that contribute to inflammation and the elimination of S. aureus. These
findings improved our understanding of functions that are common for both IL-36 and IL-1. New unpublished
data indicate mechanisms whereby the two cytokine groups also have distinct functions and how they may
contribute to AD when dysregulated. To elucidate these mechanisms, we will here use mouse models of in
vivo skin infections with HSV1 and S. aureus to identify the IL-1 and IL-36 sensing cell types essential for
immune responses that promote inflammation and restrict the pathogens. These studies will involve a new
floxed IL-36 receptor mouse strain we developed, in conjunction with an existing floxed IL-1 receptor strain.
Complementary and mechanistic studies will also be conducted in human and mouse primary cells. A
comprehensive in-depth understanding of these systems is needed to successfully suppress immune
responses therapeutically, while at the same time maintaining functional protective immunity against
pathogens such as HSV and S. aureus."
10896403,"Retinal neovascularization (RNV) is one of the major factors in vision loss, particularly in diabetic patients. In
fact, WHO reported that by 2040, out of 642 million people with diabetes globally, 35% (224 million) of them
will develop some form of diabetic retinopathy, and 11% (70 million) will suffer with sight-threatening
retinopathy. The animal models mimicking retinal vasculopathies identified a dominant role for VEGF, which
subsequently led to the development of anti-VEGF therapies targeting RNV. However, these anti-VEGF
therapies are not selective in inhibiting RNV alone, as they also affect developmental and reparative
angiogenesis. Furthermore, long-term use of anti-VEGF regiments can cause degeneration of normal blood
vessels and angiofibrosis of neural retina and choroid resulting in vitreous hemorrhage. Therefore, it is
necessary to find therapeutics that target only pathological but not physiological signaling of VEGF. To this
end, we found that GRP78 was induced robustly by OIR and possessed the capacity to influence RNV. GRP78
is the main regulator of ER stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR). In addition to its role in UPR,
GRP78 has been shown to be involved in tumor cell survival, proliferation, and drug resistance. Besides, a
correlation between GRP78 levels and RNV has also been reported. However, a causal link between these
two events is unknown. In this regard, our preliminary results revealed that GRP78 not only was induced by
OIR but also its conditional deletion in ECs reduced hypoxia-induced RNV. Furthermore, we observed that
GRP78 by triggering Wnt-independent release of b-catenin from adherent junctions and its complex formation
with STAT3 leads to cyclin D1 expression in enhancing EC proliferation and migration. Parallel to b-catenin-
STAT3-Cyclin D1 signaling, GRP78 via non-canonical NFkB RelB activation also mediates IL-8/Cxcl1/2
expression in the modulation EC sprouting. Based on these novel observations, we hypothesized that GRP78
plays a crucial role in RNV. We will address this major hypothesis by testing the following three specific aims.
Aim 1. UPR-independent activation of ATF6-GRP78 signaling is essential for VEGF/OIR-induced retinal
neovascularization; Aim 2. GRP78-mediated Wnt-independent activation of b-catenin is required for
VEGFA/OIR-induced cyclin D1 expression and retinal neovascularization; and Aim 3. Non-canonical NFkB,
RelB-mediated IL-8 expression is required for VEGFA/OIR-induced retinal neovascularization. The outcome of
these studies may identify selective drug targets for the treatment of RNV, including proliferative diabetic
retinopathy."
10907815,"Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in epilepsy. Many SUDEP cases
had genetic variants linked to cardiac arrhythmias, particularly Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). Our lab and others
showed that LQT2 patients are at a >2-fold higher risk of epilepsy, compared to genotype negative family
members. LQT2 is caused by KCNH2 variants that encode a K+ channel protein (Kv11.1), which produces K+
current (IKr). It is critical for cardiac repolarization, stabilizes the neuronal resting membrane potential, and
suppresses repetitive firing. People with KCNH2-mediated epilepsy and LQT2 need safe and effective anti-
seizure medications (ASMs). A critical barrier is the lack of a clinically relevant animal model of LQT2 with
epilepsy. We will develop the first translational model of Kcnh2-mediated epilepsy, SUDEP, and LQT2. As LQT2
patients with KCNH2 pore-domain variants are at the highest risk of seizures, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate
rabbits with a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the Kcnh2 pore-domain (Kcnh2(+/mut)). This model has superior
construct validity. Due to rodent vs. human differences in cardiac electrical function, and unphysiological Kcnh2
expression patterns, present models are not appropriate for translational studies of Kcnh2-mediated neuro-
cardiac pathologies. Many rodent models fail to reproduce the natural progression of clinical epilepsy, include
non-seizure related neuronal damage, require triggers that are not physiologically relevant, and have low
predictive validity for ASM screening. Rabbits are established models for drug testing, and studying seizures,
arrhythmias, and sudden death. In contrast to rodents, neuronal cell-types are similar in humans and rabbits.
R61: External Face Validation: Using quantifiable and clinically relevant endpoints, we will test if Kcnh2(+/mut)
rabbits reproduce the neuro-cardiac pathologies seen in LQT2 patients with epilepsy. Preliminary data indicates
that we generated a clinically-relevant rabbit model of Kcnh2-mediated epilepsy, SUDEP, and LQT2. There is
reduced Kv11.1 expression in the brain and heart, QTc prolongation, spontaneous noncardiogenic epileptic
seizures, and spontaneous seizure-mediated sudden death. R33: Despite LQT2 patients being at a high risk of
epilepsy and SUDEP, there are no established ASMs for LQT2 patients with epilepsy. We demonstrated that
LQT2 patients are at an increased risk of arrhythmias when on vs. off ASMs, particularly Na+ channel blocking
ASMs (e.g., phenytoin). External Face Validation: (1) We will demonstrate that myocytes and cortical neurons
from Kcnh2(+/mut) rabbits have reduced IKr and are hyperexcitable. (2) Similar to LQT2 patients, cellular and in
vivo assays will test if phenytoin has adverse cardiac effects in Kcnh2(+/mut) rabbits. Preliminary data indicates
phenytoin blocks IKr and causes a larger increase in QTc in Kcnh2(+/mut) vs. WT rabbits, which suggests predictive
validity of our model. Impact: We will develop a model of Kcnh2-mediated epilepsy, SUDEP, and LQT2 that
reproduces human LQT2 neuro-cardiac pathologies. It will provide a platform for identifying effective and safe
ASMs to reduce seizures and SUDEP in LQT2, and complements our research using the LQTS patient registry."

 Parkinson disease (PD) is a common and growing source of disability worldwide, and adjunctive surgical
treatments are often necessary to optimize treatment in more advanced stages of the disease once medical
therapy becomes insufficient. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become the most common and effective surgical
neuromodulatory technique for motor symptoms of PD, however selection of patients and surgical targets is
limited due to an incomplete understanding of predictive factors for DBS outcomes. Historically, levodopa
responsiveness has been the primary factor used to establish DBS candidacy, but this correlates only modestly
with motor benefit, does not predict cognitive and psychiatric effects, and offers little information on optimal DBS
target. Alternative preoperative predictors based on demographics, volumetric analysis, and functional
connectivity have been described, but these predictors vary across studies and have not been validated for
clinical use. As such, a comprehensive understanding of clinical and neuroimaging predictors of DBS effects is
necessary to improve outcomes for those with advanced PD.
 The purpose of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to enable the
candidate to develop a funded research program focused on the creation of a model of DBS effects, integrating
clinical data and preoperative MRI data to improve patient and target selection in DBS for PD. The candidate's
long term goal is to become an independent clinician-scientist investigator capable of developing and
implementing clinical neuroimaging tools to investigate DBS mechanisms, improve DBS outcomes, and develop
novel DBS applications for individuals with PD and other neurological disorders. Training and mentorship are
proposed in three key areas: (1) conducting clinical research, including study design and ethical conduct, (2)
performing advanced statistical analyses including multivariate modeling , and (3) obtaining additional skills in
neuroimaging tools and analysis, including functional and structural MRI. The research plan for this award will
be supported by the training plan as well as an expert team of mentors and an outstanding institutional research
environment. The objective of this plan is to develop and validate a model of DBS responsiveness, integrating
clinical data and preoperative MRI data, which will improve patient and target selection in DBS for PD.
Specifically, this project aims to (1) build a model of motor response to DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN)
using preoperative behavioral, volumetric, structural and functional connectivity measures, (2) validate this model
using prospective data of individuals undergoing STN DBS for PD, and (3) construct similar predictive models
for cognitive and psychiatric outcomes of STN DBS. This will set the stage for future interventional studies using
this model as a basis for patient and target selection, and lead to use of more comprehensive objective behavioral
and neuroimaging data in the preoperative evaluation and planning for DBS in PD."

Up to 36 million Americans provide caregiving to disabled adults and approximately 16.1 million provide
informal caregiving to people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Given the rising number
of older adults with disability and ADRD and the accompanying shortage and cost of paid caregivers, family
and other unpaid caregivers are increasingly vital in the long-term care of older adults. Caregiving is often
shared across multiple social partners across the life course, across generations within family, extended family,
stepfamily and non-family ties who may experience heterogeneous burden. Yet, most research focuses on
spouse and child caregivers. Digital technology-enabled studies of daily stress exposure (e.g.,
interpersonal tensions, work stress) and reactivity (i.e., the link between exposure and daily well-being
outcomes) may provide crucial information regarding the mechanisms by which caregiving is linked
with greater burden or worse psychological and physical health outcomes. The present study develops
and administers new survey instruments in the Understanding America Study (UAS) to identify caregivers and
implements new EMA assessments and wearable devices to capture caregivers’ daily experiences and their
links with daily emotional and physiological well-being among ADRD and non-ADRD family and non-family
caregivers ranging in age from young adulthood to old age. The UAS is a well-established, probability-based
Internet panel currently comprising 10,000 individuals ages 18 and older and is expected to grow to 20,000
respondents by 2027. We address three aims:
1) Build a representative, life-course sample of unpaid caregivers to follow longitudinally and collect
real-time daily experience and physiological data, called UAS-Caregiving Lifecourse Experiences
Assessed in Real-time (UAS-CLEAR). 2) Compare daily experiences (stress exposure, stress reactivity)
among ADRD and non-ADRD family and non-family caregivers from young adulthood to old age. 3)
Identify individuals who are more or less resilient to daily stress and examine whether resilience
factors vary between ADRD and non-ADRD family and non-family caregivers. Family caregivers are
essential to the nation’s well-being and economy yet little information exists regarding the daily lives of ADRD
and non-ADRD caregivers across the diverse social partners who provide care. Understanding daily
experiences and reactivity and the factors that predict greater resilience and vulnerability to stress in a national
sample of caregivers will provide unprecedented information regarding potentially modifiable risk and
protective factors for improving caregiver health and well-being."

Acute and chronic wildland fire smoke inhalation have been linked to increased mortality as well as respiratory
and cardiovascular morbidity, though the extent to which the frequency and duration of exposure or the
chemical and particle profiles of the smoke contribute to the observed health effects remains unknown. As the
occurrences of wildland fires and number of people living at the wildland urban interface (WUI) continue to
increase, prolonged inhalation of wildland fire smoke poses a serious threat to public health. Due to this, there
is an urgent need to better understand the adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes associated with the exposure to
wildland urban smoke. The smoke that arises from wildland fires at the WUI is a complex mixture of gases,
trace metals, and fine and ultrafine particles. The latter are particularly dangerous for human health, since they
deposit in the deep regions of the lungs and may translocate into the blood stream, increasing the oxidative and
inflammatory burden, both locally and systemically. Prolonged inflammation can lead to the development of
obstructive lung disease and atherosclerosis. To investigate the link between exposure to WUI smoke and
development of cardiopulmonary dysfunction, our interdisciplinary team brings together expertise in fire
generation and characterization, rodent aerosol exposures, respiratory mechanics, lung biology, and
cardiovascular physiology. To fulfill our goals, we will create lab-scale smoke using materials representative of
WUI regions in Southern California and we will deliver it to mice. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of
frequency and duration of the exposure, as well as particulate concentration of the wildland fire smoke. In Aim
2, we will focus on the relative contribution of different fuel sources characteristic of the WUI. Furthermore, as
part of this ONES early-stage-investigator project, the PI and co-Is will generate an external advisory panel
consisting of inhalation toxicology researchers, public health advocates, and fire protection experts.
Dissemination of new knowledge gained from this proposal to the community will be a vital part of this
endeavor."

Influx of eosinophils is typically associated with type II responses during allergy. More recent reports indicate
that eosinophils have essential immunoregulatory roles, as well as key anti-microbial effects against helminths,
viruses, and some bacterial species. However, the mechanisms underlying how eosinophils contribute to
eliminating bacteria are understudied, and results are diametrically different depending upon the infecting
pathogen and in acute versus chronic infection. In this application, we propose to investigate the role of
eosinophils during persistent Salmonella infection within mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of 129X1/Sv/J mice.
Our unpublished data show that eosinophils, which we have localized to STm-containing granulomas, increased
significantly over the first 8 weeks of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (STm) infection, correlated with an
increase in the eosinophil chemoattractant CCL11. In addition, depletion of eosinophils in STm-infected mice
rendered mice more susceptible to infection. Importantly, eosinophil-depleted mice had a significant reduction of
IFNγ-producing cells and lower tissue levels of IFNγ compared to IgG2 controls, suggesting that eosinophils
contribute to pathogen control by influencing the granuloma microenvironment to be Th1 skewed. Our central
hypothesis is that the functions of eosinophils within infected tissues are regulated by microenvironments, such
as the granuloma, and function to contain the pathogen during persistent infection. The impact of eosinophils on
granuloma formation and pathogen control via the production of extracellular DNA traps and possible
manipulation by bacterial virulence factors will be investigated (Aim 1). In addition, we will characterize the
immunoregulatory effector functions of eosinophils during STm persistence in the MLNs (Aim 2)."

Allergic immune responses contribute to the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. Antibodies of the IgE isotype
play a critical role in the initiation of allergic immune responses. In allergic individuals, IgE is produced with
specificity for environmental or food antigens. Typically, this IgE production occurs in response to repetitive
antigen exposure. However, at a fundamental level, remarkably little is known about the cellular dynamics of
IgE production upon repetitive antigen exposure in antibody recall responses. In order to overcome technical
difficulties in studying the cells that produce IgE, we and other groups developed methodology, including the
generation of fluorescent IgE reporter mice, to directly detect IgE B cells and plasma cells by flow cytometry
and microscopy. These methodological advances have thus far provided critical new insights into the distinct
characteristics of B cells and plasma cells expressing IgE compared with other isotypes during primary
immune responses. We now propose to apply this methodology to directly study IgE-expressing B cells and
plasma cells in the context of re-exposure to antigen. The overall objective of this study is to characterize
features of antibody recall responses that promote or suppress IgE production. The specific goals of this study
are to: 1) determine the cellular origin(s) of IgE plasma cells in antibody recall responses and 2) elucidate how
memory B cells and germinal center B cells affect IgE responses to secondary immunization. These studies
will provide critical new insights into how IgE responses are regulated during antibody recall responses, which
will increase our understanding of how IgE production occurs in allergic disease."

The Leadership and Administrative Core (LAC) provides coherent administrative leadership and
organizational oversight of the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR).
The extraordinary stability of MCUAAAR leadership and Center productivity is directly related to the skills of
MCUAAAR’s long-time Principal Investigator Dr. James Jackson who was the PI of the Center from its
inception in 1997 until his death in 2020. Dr. Jackson created a succession plan for the 2018-2023 period
that integrated Dr. Robert Joseph Taylor into the administrative core and led to him becoming the PI in
2020. In this proposal Dr. Taylor and long-time co-director Dr. Peter Lichtenberg become MPIs for the
MCUAAAR. The three main goals of the MCUAAAR from 2023-2028 include: (1) Utilizing our three-
university partnership to achieve exceptional productivity and collaborations with key NIA and other funded
Centers; (2) Continue the long-term focus on Diversity Equity Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA) among core
faculty of MCUAAAR and building the next generation of MCUAAAR leaders, as well as insuring
accessibility for our scientists and community members attending our events and; (3) Continue the
integration of Michigan State University into the MCUAAAR with special attention paid to the maturation of
the community core efforts in Flint. The LAC specific aims are to (1) Provide the leadership, structure, and
proven methods and technologies necessary to ensure the optimal performance and integration of core
functions and participants, (2) Coordinate short- and long-term mentoring, retention efforts, and follow-up
for 15 ethnic minority junior faculty whose research focus is on the unique aspects of stress and coping
among older African Americans using a life course approach, and (3) Enhance our established nationally
recognized model for successfully engaging with African American communities. The LAC will oversee the
extraordinary partnerships the MCUAAAR has with NIA Centers (MCCFAD, an AD-RCMAR, MADRC, an
Alzheimer’s Center, NACDA and the Pepper Center) as well as other NIH Centers/Projects (e.g. HRS,
CURES). The LAC’s Dr. Robert Joseph Taylor has a strong history with research leaders at five HBCUs
who are proposed to become partners with the MCUAAAR. The LAC’s structure ensures the integration of
all its cores with the REC and with each other as well as ensures regular executive committee meetings,
evaluations of all programmatic aspects and a process of recruitment and selection of pilot scientists. The
proposed activities of the LAC and the MCUAAAR as a whole will allow for even more significant advances
in research, faculty development and community member engagement in the research process."

Targeted therapeutic agents range in size from very small organic molecules (100’s of Da) to
protein-based molecules like monoclonal antibodies (~150,000 Da). Small disulfide bonded
peptides have evolved in many species, including plants and animals, to have ideal
pharmacological properties including high affinity target binding, stability to proteases, heat and
other stresses. Such peptides include “cyclotides” or “knottins” which can inhibit enzymes, ion
channels, and GPCRs with high potency and are often the major active component of venoms
of many predator organisms. We have uncovered convergent evolution between ultralong third
complementary determining regions (CDR H3s) in the heavy chain of an unusual class of cow
antibodies and cyclotide/knottin peptides. We can produce these “knob” peptides in microbial
systems and they retain the binding and potency properties of the parent antibody. These tiny
peptide-based molecules are small (~4-6 kDa), highly stable, and can bind targets at
subnanomolar KD. We have already developed a panel of virus neutralizing knob peptides
against SARS-CoV-2 which bind unique epitopes, and some of which maintain high affinity
binding to various SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the recent ‘delta’ and ‘omicron’ strains. The
high stability, potency, and straightforward manufacturing path enables multiple routes of
administration, potentially including inhaled or intranasal delivery, which could be very important
prophylactic or treatment in the current or future coronavirus pandemic. Our goals in this project
are to further develop the technology to identify peptidic knob domains, expand our panel of
knobs against SARS-CoV-2 variants and other coronaviruses like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-
1, understand the structural basis of their binding, and validate their activity in vitro and in vivo.
The knobs identified here can potentially be used as monotherapy or combination therapy in the
current or a new coronavirus pandemic, and will be a valuable new therapeutic class to add to
the arsenal against coronavirus disease."
10741686,"NMARC is a NIAAA-designated Specialized Alcohol Research P50 Center comprised of teams of preclinical and
clinical scientists with a history of collaborative research interactions, whose expertise and contributions have
synergized the center’s research environment and is facilitating progress towards the achievement of NMARC’s
three strategic objectives. These objectives are to: 1) Advance our understanding of how prenatal alcohol
exposure (PAE) affects basic neurobiological mechanisms resulting in functional brain damage, which can lead
to life-long adverse neurobehavioral consequences. 2) Develop more effective approaches for the diagnosis of
individuals with FASD by establishing more sensitive and clinically reliable biomarkers of PAE that are detectable
earlier in life, are prognostic of functional brain damage, and could predict long-lasting neurobehavioral
consequences in patients with FASD. 3) Develop interventions more effective for PAE-related behavioral deficits.
Better interventions may require combinations of neurobehavioral, educational and/or pharmacotherapeutic
approaches to ameliorate the often subtle, but long-lasting impact of PAE. NMARC’s prevailing philosophy is
that a research center organized to maximize the coordination, communication and synergistic integration across
multiple lines of preclinical and clinical investigation provides the best long-term prospect of achieving significant
progress towards the dual clinical goals of better diagnosis and interventions that are more effective for patients
with FASD. NMARC’s specific aims as an integrated whole during the P50 Phase III will continue to be to: 1)
Accelerate progress on each on NMARC’s three strategic objectives. 2) Catalyze the expansion of NMARC’s
research capacity and capabilities. 3) Enhance our ability to disseminate knowledge about FASD through
seminars, symposia and community outreach activities. 4) Increase the number of undergraduate and graduate
students, fellows and residents training in the FASD research field. This competing renewal contains three
preclinical and one clinical research components, each consisting of teams of investigators whose projects
address one or more of NMARC’s three strategic objectives. Three core components support the research
program: 1) A Pilot Project Core of two two-year projects involving faculty investigators new to FASD research.
2) A Scientific Core supporting production of experimental offspring for preclinical projects and recruitment of
human subjects for the clinical project, as well as data management and statistical support for all NMARC-
affiliated projects. 3) An Administrative Core providing scientific and administrative leadership for the entire
NMARC, along with administrative support and budgetary oversight of all NMARC-related activities. The
Administrative Core and a Steering Committee are also responsible for ensuring progress towards achieving the
Specific Aims of the Center as a whole. Assessment of NMARC’s progress towards the achievement of these

that will support, enhance and integrate human and animal studies. Specifically, the Scientific Core will support
the recruitment of human subjects for research components and future pilots via the Neurodiagnostic Clinic
(Center for Developmental Disability (CDD)-Department of Pediatrics). This will ensure that clinical projects
focused on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders have access to appropriate subject populations. The Scientific
Core will also consolidate and standardize prenatal and postnatal alcohol exposure procedures and mouse
colony management for preclinical components. In addition to reducing research costs, this will allow
investigators to query relationships between their findings and those obtained in other research components
and, thus, facilitate integration of the research components. The Scientific Core will provide research support to
all Components and Pilot Projects in several ways including providing bio-statistics support for all of the research
components, as well as assisting with study design and data analysis to ensure both rigor and reproducibility of
results and consistency in approach across projects where appropriate. The Scientific Core will facilitate the use
of the Center for Brain Recovery & Repair Pre-Clinical Core for studies proposed in several Center components
(e.g., automated behavioral testing, slide scanner, Imaris image analysis software). The Scientific Core will also
support development of new research directions by assisting investigators with implementation of novel
behavioral and alcohol exposure paradigms (including pilot projects). Besides reducing research costs, the
centralized services of the Core will allow investigators to query relationships between their findings and those

10741689,"The cognitive and behavioral effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) have broad, lifelong impacts on
individuals with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), with fewer than half of individuals with an FASD
able to live independently as adults. Combined with the current prevalence estimates of FASD, at up to 5% of
the population in the United States, this leads to considerable societal costs. Despite this disease burden,
there are no pharmaceutical agents and few interventions specific to FASD. This project will facilitate forward
and backward translation between animal and human models with a long-term goal of guiding development of
interventions to alleviate the effects of PAE. Neural oscillations are ubiquitous in mammalian brains and are
measurable using local field potentials and noninvasive measures. Using magnetoencephalography in
adolescents 12-16 years of age, this clinical project will elicit neural oscillations in two cognitive tasks and
rest, which have been reliably used in both rodent and human models, and assess structural connectivity
using diffusion tensor imaging. We have shown previously that alpha oscillations are altered due to PAE
during rest and alpha power was linked to cortico-thalamic connectivity in younger individuals with an FASD.
We hypothesize that these alterations in alpha oscillations persist into adolescence and are related to cortico-
thalamic connectivity as examined in Component 4 (functional connectivity) and Component 6 (structural
connectivity). We have previously identified altered gamma oscillations in adolescents with an FASD in basic
sensory tasks and here we hypothesize that gamma alterations will be evident during cognitive tasks and
related to cognitive effects of PAE that persist into adolescence. In aim 1, we will test these hypotheses by
quantifying the group differences of alpha and gamma oscillations during performance of a visual spatial
working memory task, a set-shifting task, and during rest. In aim 2 we will test the underlying mechanisms
related to altered neural oscillations using the Human Neocortical Neurosolver computational model designed
to model noninvasive population responses measured with MEG. We hypothesize that altering cortico-
thalamic model parameters will alter alpha oscillations in line with empirical findings. We further hypothesize
that altering excitatory/inhibitory input parameters due to the effects of PAE on inhibitory interneurons will best
match alterations in gamma oscillations measured empirically. Finally, aim 3 will examine the effects of
chronic stress, often experienced by individuals with an FASD, on alpha and gamma oscillations to gain a
broader understanding of how environment combines with the effects of PAE to alter brain function in
adolescence. This aim will align with Component 5. This innovative project is the first to link noninvasive
measures of neural oscillations to PAE preclinical studies using similar tasks, the first to apply a biophysical
computational model to link clinical and preclinical findings in PAE, and to examine the role of chronic stress
and PAE on neural oscillations and their relation to cognition and behavior."

The recent major breakthroughs in the development of accurate blood-based Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers,
including phospho-tau217 (pTau217), have the potential to truly revolutionize AD diagnostics. However, these
novel biomarkers must now be thoroughly validated in a prospective fashion in clinical practice before they can be
implemented in the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of AD in specialist clinics and primary care globally. This
validation is urgently needed because of the relatively low accuracy of the clinical diagnostic work-up without
support of accurate AD biomarkers, resulting in misdiagnoses of 25-30% of AD patients in specialist memory
clinics and >50% in primary care. Furthermore, it is important to determine in which patients and real-world clinical
settings these novel blood AD biomarkers clearly improve diagnosis, treatment, and care, which is essential for
reimbursement in many countries. Finally, we also need accurate prognostic tools to identify those individuals with
early AD who are most likely to show imminent clinical decline, because this group may benefit most from targeted
interventions. This is highly timely considering the recent advent of disease-modifying AD therapies that may soon
become widely available.
 Given the excellent infrastructure of the primary care system in Sweden and research biomarker protocols
already approved and fully integrated in clinical practice, we have a unique opportunity to test these novel blood
AD markers in broad, diverse, and unselected populations that are generalizable to other real-world settings. To
achieve this ambitious goal, we will conduct two novel and unique prospective studies in specialist memory clinic
(n=800) and general primary care (n=800) settings. First, we aim to prospectively validate plasma AD biomarkers
for the diagnosis of patients with cognitive symptoms evaluated in either specialist memory clinics or in primary
care. Following recent expert consensus recommendations, we will use i) predefined biomarker cut-offs, ii) bi-
weekly analysis of the plasma samples and iii) appropriate reference standards (i.e., PET/CSF). We anticipate that
we will identify - within 48 months - AD blood biomarkers with high potential for implementation in memory clinic
and/or primary care settings. Second, we will determine whether blood-based AD biomarkers improve patient
management in specialist memory clinic settings and general primary care settings. Demonstrating improvements
of the AD diagnostic work-up and treatment when compared to “care-as-usual” is essential for regulatory authorities
to approve future reimbursement of blood-based biomarkers. Third, we aim to optimize the prognosis of patients
with early AD by combining (prospectively analyzed) plasma AD biomarkers with brief digital cognitive tests. The
expected outcome is a combination of easily accessible and time- and cost-effective blood biomarkers and digital
cognitive tests that can predict short-term cognitive decline and progression to AD dementia in primary care.
 At the end of this project, our expected goal is that blood-based biomarkers and prognostic algorithms will be
ready for clinical implementation in both specialist clinics and primary care."

 This proposal presents a five-year research career development program on the study of lysosomal
pH and function in aging and disease to expand our understanding of the mechanisms by which aging
contributes to neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The candidate, Dr. Courtney
Lane-Donovan, is currently a Clinical Fellow in Neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, in
the division of Memory and Aging. The outlined proposal builds on Dr. Lane-Donovan’s previous research
experience in mouse models of AD to gain new domains of expertise represented by her mentor team of
primary mentor Dr. Aimee Kao and co-mentor Dr. Anna Molofsky of the departments of neurology and
psychiatry, respectively, at UCSF. The proposed experiments, didactic work, and training in academic
skills will provide Dr. Lane-Donovan with a unique skillset that will enable her transition to independence
as a physician scientist leader in the field of aging and neurodegenerative diseases.
 As our nation ages, the burden of the aging-related neurodegenerative diseases has increased
substantially. How aging promotes protein aggregation in certain brain regions – and more importantly,
how to reverse the effect – remains unknown. Protein aggregates can accumulate when protein
degradation by proteases in the lysosome is impaired, and several genetic risk factors for AD encode
proteins involved in endolysosomal function and autophagy. Lysosomal proteases function optimally at an
acidic pH, and data from invertebrate models suggest that age and stress cause lysosomes to lose their
acidity, resulting in impaired function; however, the relevance of these findings to human aging and disease
is unclear. Regional variation in lysosomal protease activity may contribute to the selective vulnerability of
certain brain regions to the accumulation of protein aggregates; however, regional lysosomal function is
not fully characterized and thereby poorly understood. Together, this suggests a tantalizing hypothesis -
regional variability of lysosomal protease expression leaves certain neurons more vulnerable to the
lysosomal dysfunction caused by lysosomal alkalinization with age. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 utilizes
the novel lysosomal pH reporter, FIRE-pHLy (Fluorescent Indicator Reporting pH of the Lysosome) to
delineate the effect of aging and amyloid beta accumulation on lysosomal pH. Aim 2 will determine regional
changes in lysosomal protease activity and expression in the aging brain by combining lysosome
isolations, immunohistochemistry, and spatial transcriptomics. The data generated by this study can be
used to propose new models of lysosomal dysfunction in aging and disease and identify new therapeutic
targets for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative disease."

Numerous promising investigational therapies for the treatment of epilepsy have been identified using well-
established animal models of seizure and epilepsy for over 80 years. In this time, the maximal electroshock
test in mice and rats, the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol test in mice and rats, and more recently the 6 Hz
assay in mice, have all been utilized as primary models of electrically or chemically evoked seizures in
neurologically intact rodents. In addition, rodent kindling models, in which network hyperexcitability has
developed, have been used to identify new and highly impactful agents, such as levetiracetam. This screening
approach has successfully identified several marketed drugs to manage the symptomatic seizures associated
with epilepsy. Despite the numerous antiseizure drugs (ASDs) on the market today, nearly 30% of patients with
epilepsy are resistant to these currently available medications. Further, no treatment has yet been identified to
slow or prevent the development of epilepsy altogether. To address this unmet medical need, more effective
and better tolerated treatments are still desperately needed by the patient with epilepsy. Our group has
recently uncovered the antiseizure efficacy of several repurposed therapeutic agents that engage untapped
molecular targets associated with normal nervous system development and tissue homeostasis in adulthood.
Further, we have demonstrated in a mouse model of evoked chronic seizures that repeated administration of
repurposed agents is well-tolerated and can possibly disrupt the formation of a hyperexcitable neuronal
network, suggesting a possible disease modifying effect. This study will therefore extend the antiseizure
efficacy profile of these two promising investigational compounds for the treatment of symptomatic seizures to
establish a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship, as well as assess their potential to prevent
epilepsy altogether in well-established rodent seizure and epilepsy models. We will use a clinically relevant rat
model of acquired epilepsy that provides a valid platform on which to evaluate the disease-modifying potential
of two promising candidate compounds. This study aims to further characterize the therapeutic potential of two
promising compounds for the treatment of acute seizures, as well as define the extent to which treatment
modifies the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures, i.e., demonstrate whether epilepsy is delayed or
prevented. Further, this study will determine whether the use of novel repurposed agents with promising
preliminary efficacy profiles demonstrate the potential to be first-in-class therapies for the treatment, and
possibly prevention, of epilepsy."

Most human cancer cells exhibit genome instability, ranging from elevated mutation rates (base substitutions
and indels) to chromosomal rearrangements (CRs) and aneuploidy. The application of next generation
sequencing (NGS) technologies to analyze cancer genomes has resulted in a wealth of information on the
spectrum of genomic instability, and led to the identification of specific mutation and CR signatures associated
with loss of different DNA repair pathways. The prevailing view is that CRs are generated through error-prone
processing of damaged chromosomes. Although the nature of the initiating lesions for CRs is unknown, much
of the genetic evidence from yeast and human cells implicates DNA replication errors as a source of the
broken chromosomes that fuel CRs. The two aims outlined in this proposal will address the source of initiating
lesions for CRs, and measure the frequency and spectra of CRs in wild type and repair-deficient cells in
response to defined DNA damage. In the first aim, we will induce site-specific DSBs using CRISPR-Cas9 in
yeast or human cells and determine the full spectrum of CRs in surviving cells. The experiments will be
performed in cells lacking specific components of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homology-dependent
repair (HR) or DNA damage signaling pathways to determine how distinct types of CRs are suppressed. We
expect to define unique CR signatures for each deficiency that could guide identification of novel CR
signatures in tumor DNA. In the second aim, we will compare the types of CRs formed in response to a stalled
replication fork with CRs resulting from endonuclease-induced DSBs. We will use the bacterial Tus/Ter system
to create a site-specific stalled replication fork in yeast or human cells, identify the resulting types of CRs and
the factors that suppress different CR outcomes. The powerful genetic screens proposed should enable
identification of mutational events (base substitutions and indels) in addition to CRs and we will also
characterize these events and the repair pathways that suppress their formation. We expect the knowledge
garnered from these studies will aid in identifying new mutational signatures and their underlying pathologies."

 Genomic instability is a hallmark of human cancers. Both ATM and BRCA1 (Project 1) are ubiquitously
expressed tumor suppressor genes implicated in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. Yet, their losses cause
very different types of cancers – predominantly lymphomas in ATM-deficiency, and breast or ovarian cancers in
BRCA1-deficiency (Project 1). The causes for such tissue-specific malignancy risk are not fully understood.
Sequence analyses of human cancers identified a unique substitution and rearrangement signatures, some of
which (e.g. substitution signature 3 and short tandem duplications) have been linked to BRCA1 deficiency. ATM-
loss has not been linked to any signature, in part due to the low frequency (2-8%) ATM-inactivation in many
cancer types. As such, the ATM-loss signatures is concealed by tissue-specific genomic signatures and the
heterogeneity of human genomes. Here we use inbred mouse models (identical genome) to uncover ATM-loss
associated substitution and rearrangement signatures in lymphocytes (uniform cell type) and use the High
Throughput Genomic Translocation Sequencing (HTGTS) to examine lymphoma relevant translocations from
antigen receptor genes. Using ATAC-seq, which measures chromosomal accessibility via Tn5 transposase
insertion, we observed temporal changes of local accessibility around DSBs and, surprisingly, polarization of
global accessibility in regions distant from the targeted breaks: increases accessibility of accessible regions and
decrease the accessibility of non-accessible regions in a 53BP1-dependent manner. And the high accessibility
regions are also at risk for additional breaks measured by End-Seq and chromosomal translocations measured
by HTGTS. Since ATM phosphorylates histone H2AX and 53BP1 to promotes their recruitment to nucleosome
occupied regions, we hypothesize that DNA damage response leads to redistribution of the chromatin
bounded factors (e.g. 53BP1) based on nucleosome density and contribute to cell type specific genomic
instability (breaks and translocations) and malignancies. To test this, we will 1) address the molecular
mechanisms by which ATM mediated DNA damage response regulates the pattern and outcome of
chromosomal translocations during the assembly and modification of antigen receptor gene products and during
lymphomagenesis, 2) characterize the impact of cell cycle phases (G1, G2, proliferating) on translocation pattern,
and 3) elucidate the translocation outcome of different type of breaks – clean breaks, RAG or AID initiated
breaks and replication stress induced lesions. In collaboration with others in the P01, we will integrate the
damage induced accessibility changes with substitution and rearrangement signatures (Project 1 & 2), cell cycle
(Project 2 & 4) and 3D organization (Project 4). By comparing the signatures from ATM-deficient vs BRCA1-
deficient (Project 1) cells, the results will shed lights on how loss of these two major tumor suppressors cause
different genomic instability signatures and eventually lead to tissue/organ specific malignancies."

Exercise is increasingly being seen as an effective form of therapy against many diseases. Maternal exercise,
especially during pregnancy, has long-lasting effects on childhood wellbeing. Part of these beneficial effects
come from the secretion of exercise-induced hormones called exerkines. While research into exercise and
exerkines as medicines continue to grow, methods to longitudinally quantify exercise efficacy remain to be
elucidated. This research builds tools and methods to track exercise efficacy using metabolic imaging.
We hypothesize that exercise in mice will result in activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT). This metabolic
activation can be detected using hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (HP-MRI). HP-MRI is a cutting-
edge metabolic imaging platform that can quantify metabolic flux. HP is a method that increases the sensitivity
of non-radioactive, stable carbon-13 labeled molecules, such as [1-13C] pyruvate. This increased sensitivity
enables detection of pyruvate conversion to lactate, as well as bicarbonate as surrogate markers of metabolism.
Therefore, we hypothesize that HP-MRI will enable non-invasive detection of BAT activation, due to exercise
and exerkine exposure.
In Aim 1, we longitudinally track BAT activation in a mouse model of exercise using HP-MRI. We pioneer the
development of two different HP imaging probes, [1-13C] pyruvate and diethyl-[1-13C]-α-ketoglutarate (DE--KG).
We will then compare HP-MRI with gold-standard plasma exerkine measurements, to confirm metabolic
activation.
In Aim 2, we extend our experiments to use HP-MRI in offspring of exercised mice. Finally, we ask if HP-MRI
can detect metabolic changes in offspring challenged with high-fat, high-fructose diets. Taken together, our Aims
provide conceptual and technical innovation, pioneering a non-invasive imaging method to study the effects of
exercise in pregnant mothers and their offspring.
To ensure success, our research team consists of a unique combination of expertise in biochemistry, imaging,
and exercise biology. Successful completion of the aims will have a major impact on our understanding of the
long term effects of exercise, in both pregnant mothers and their offspring, well into adulthood."

10747379,"Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCMs) are common neurovascular lesions made of endothelium clusters
filled with blood surrounded by gliosis. CCMs affect ~1/200 children and adults, causing a lifetime risk of
hemorrhagic strokes and neurologic deficits for which there is no current effective pharmacologic therapy. Loss
of function mutations in three CCM genes propels brain vascular changes. However, the propensity of CCM
lesions to form in the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma relative to other tissues has not been fully
explained, and the heterogeneity in disease severity suggests that environmental or biological factors (e.g. other
genes, neural cells) act as disease modifiers. We and others have demonstrated that increased vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and associated vascular leakage are significant contributors to CCM
disease. Our preliminary data show that hypoxic conditions contribute to an aggressive onset and progression
of CCM disease. We observed that hypoxia acts as an accelerant of CCM disease by exacerbating the number
and size of brain vascular lesions in CCM animal models. We also observed that mouse and human CCM tissue
results in increased hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1a) activity, and that proliferative astrocytes influence
CCM pathogenesis. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that hypoxia exacerbates CCMs through
hypoxic programs from astrocytes and endothelium, leading to abnormal vascular development and stroke due
to intracranial hemorrhage. Moreover, we hypothesize that intermittent hypoxia (that occurs with patients with
obstructive sleep apnea) will further exacerbate CCMs. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that hypoxia
exacerbates CCM formation by elevating hypoxia-driven genes in astrocytes in murine CCM. We will
investigate the effect of hypoxia on astrocyte gene expression (e.g., hypoxic program, VEGF) by profiling
translated mRNAs obtained from the purification of the EGFP-tagged ribosome in astrocytes in the presence or
absence of CCM lesions. Co-culture in vitro models will be used to define the interaction between CCM
endothelium and astrocytes that propels vascular dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that
hypoxia exacerbates CCM formation by HIF-1a protein stabilization in the brain endothelium in murine
CCM. We will investigate the role of endothelial HIF-1a on changes in the endothelial barrier function, gene
expression, VEGF signaling using CCM mouse models. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that
intermittent hypoxia exacerbates murine CCM. We will investigate the role of intermittent hypoxia-driven CCM
lesion burden, using mouse models of CCM under intermittent hypoxia that partially recapitulates nocturnal
oxygen profile in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The proposed research may lead to a new
therapeutic approach (e.g., combination therapies for activated astrocytes and CCM endothelium) and
preventive measures by defining how environmental (e.g., high altitude) or pathological factors (e.g., OSA,
chronic lung disease) that alter oxygen levels may act as risk factors for patients affected with CCMs."

 Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. The FDA-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors
targeting PD1 and CTLA4 and the targeted therapies against BRAF and MEK have greatly improved overall
survival in metastatic melanoma. Nevertheless, many patients die from metastatic melanoma including those
with inflamed tumors (i.e., tumors bearing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes). There is therefore room to improve
melanoma treatments for human patients.
 Here we propose the development of therapeutic mRNA vaccines against melanomas. Specifically, our
proposal leverages a materials optimization approach to identify an Optimized Tannic Acid Lipid Nanoparticle
Formulation that can suppress melanoma growth by delivering mRNAs encoding Melanoma-Associated
Antigens into Dendritic Cell Populations. In undertaking this approach, this proposal aims to further our
understanding of the mRNA delivery capabilities of Tannic Acid Lipid Nanoparticles while simultaneously laying
the groundwork to advance therapeutic mRNA vaccines against melanomas toward the clinic."
10844626,"Project Summary
In 2020 alone, about 200 million oral antibiotic prescriptions were dispensed by outpatient healthcare providers
in the United States. Broad-spectrum antibiotics make up most of these prescriptions. However, in addition to
targeting the intended pathogen, broad-spectrum antibiotics alter the composition of the human microbiome
(dysbiosis). Dysbiosis caused by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment can increase susceptibility to or worsen
the outcome of disease, including inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and psychiatric and neurodegenerative
disorders. Therefore, it is important to develop therapeutic strategies that minimize the collateral damage of
broad-spectrum antibiotics. Here we propose to explore molecules that selectively antagonize the activity of
broad-spectrum antibiotics as a strategy to minimize dysbiosis. The advantage of selective antidotes over the
alternative strategy of developing narrow-spectrum or pathogen-targeted antibiotics is to be able to continue to
use already developed broad-spectrum antibiotics. Proof-of-concept for the selective antidote strategy has been
recently provided. From the four previously identified antidotes, three are not available in the US due to their
toxicity, and the remaining one has poor water solubility and unfavorable pharmacokinetics. We have recently
discovered a family of depsipeptide natural products we named pseudovibriamides. Pseudovibriamides are
produced by Pseudovibrio bacteria that are part of the healthy microbiome of marine sponges. Interestingly,
Pseudovibrio has been proposed to contribute to marine sponge health by producing broad-spectrum antibiotics
that can prevent the growth of pathogens. Marine sponges are ancient animals that form important symbiotic
relationships with their microbes. Thus, broad-spectrum antibiotics known to be produced by Pseudovibrio and
other sponge bacteria would cause dysbiosis in the sponge animal. We hypothesize that pseudovibriamides act
as selective antidotes to protect commensal bacteria and the sponge host but allow activity against pathogens.
We envisage the ecological role of pseudovibriamides may be translated into pharmaceutical applications. This
proposal has two aims. Aim 1 is to improve access to pseudovibriamides using biosynthetic methods and Aim 2
is to explore their antibiotic and strain spectra. We will use sponge bacteria commensals and pathogens as
controls to test the hypothesis. We will then explore the spectrum of antidote activity of pseudovibriamides with
widely used antibiotics and the human pathogens they are intended to treat, and with prevalent and abundant
human commensals. Thus, this proposal will enable facile access to and will explore the antidote spectrum of a
family of bacterial natural products shown to have antibiotic antidote activity. What we learn will serve as
steppingstones for future studies on their mode of action to enable the discovery of further antidotes."

this by implementing a clearly defined recruitment program that attracts promising Scientists to address the
RCMAR’s theme and aims, including a new initiative of ‘pipeline scientists’ that are engaged a year ahead of
their start in the program. We anticipate a new cohort of four new Scientists each year. Aim 2: Create and monitor
an Individualized Career Development Plan for each Scientist. Upon recruitment, a 2-year Plan as RCMAR
Scientist will identify a lead mentor and mentoring team members with defined roles, regular meetings, and
specific professional development experiences. The Plan will include benchmarks, timeline, and outcomes. Aim
3: Implement and monitor a Structured Program of Mentoring and Research Education, with activities for
the scientists in the program. The Pilot Project in year-1 of their Plan will serve as the platform for the structured
program to boost the scientists’ career in minority aging, followed by a focus in year-2 on productive team science
and seeking external funding. Activities will include biweekly group meetings, training in social and behavioral
aspects of minority aging and health disparities, team science, the preparation and submission of grant
proposals, a K-award discussion group, and training in the responsible conduct of research. RCMAR Scientists
will maintain a Scientific Portfolio that documents milestones and reflects progress, which will be used in a formal

aging and health disparities. We are a research-based, mentoring partnership of four academic institutions:
The University of Alabama at Birmingham, The University of Alabama, Morehouse School of Medicine, and
Tuskegee University working together to recruit minority investigators, provide education in aging and health
disparities research, guide career development through collaborative mentoring, and sustain progress to
successful, independent research careers. The research focus of the Deep South RCMAR is on reducing
health disparities between Black/African American (B/AA) and White older adults in the Deep South, the region
of the country where the majority of older B/AAs live and health disparities have been particularly persistent.
We focus on health problems particularly prevalent among older B/AAs in our region and for which disparities
have been identified in both rural and urban settings. Our specific aims are to: (1) identify, engage, and
mentor outstanding faculty under-represented in academia who are committed to academic careers in
aging and health disparities research; (2) provide high quality research education and individualized career
development support; (3) support innovative, high impact pilot projects that will advance the science of
minority aging and health disparities; (4) provide expertise and resources for working collaboratively with
communities in areas of interest to them and in the recruitment and retention of older B/AAs in research; (5)
provide expertise and resources for study design, culturally sensitive measurement, data analysis, and
access to databases for secondary analysis; and (6) disseminate to scientific, professional and lay audiences
research results addressing the reduction of health disparities through the improvement of minority health,
particularly for older B/AAs. We propose continuation and enhancements of the cores established during
the first three funding cycles: the Research Education Component, the Leadership and Administrative Core,
the Analysis Core, and the Community Liaison and Recruitment Core. Over the next five years, we will fund
at least 15 pilot projects; provide research education through our inter-disciplinary Health Disparities Research
Education Program; and assist RCMAR Scientists to obtain career development or independent research
grants. With renewal of the Deep South RCMAR, we also propose innovations in each core to enhance our
overall program effectiveness in recruiting minority investigators, providing education in aging and heath

10916500,"SUMMARY
Visual perception is a confluence of visual input and attentional state. How visual inputs are processed and
represented in human visual cortex is being captured with increasing accuracy in the field. However, a critical
gap in our understanding is how top-down inputs from higher order areas influence and sculpt sensory
processing—especially an understanding grounded in direct causal manipulations. The long-term goal of the
proposed research is to develop causal perturbation methods that modulate visual processing in ways that
mimic attentional processes. To achieve this goal, we will use electrical stimulation to test, refine, and extend
a quantitative model of feedback information flow to the ventral temporal cortex (VTC). Our research
leverages a recent clinical shift in epilepsy surgery from brain surface recordings with electrocorticography to
stereo-electroencephalographic (sEEG) depth electrodes: sEEG provides unique opportunities to measure
VTC and electrically stimulate feedback projections from gyral and sulcal parietal, frontal and anterior
temporal regions as well as the white matter pathways that connect these areas to VTC. In Aim 1, we will
determine how stimulating these different feedback locations affects neuronal activity in VTC and simulate
VTC signals in a model of a cortical column. VTC electrodes will be localized functionally with a scene
perception task and structural connections will be identified from preoperative diffusion MRI measurements
on Mayo Clinic’s novel compact 3T scanner with high performance gradients and distortion free imaging. In
Aim 2, we will determine the optimal stimulation frequencies for feedback pathways to VTC. Electrodes in
feedback pathways will be stimulated with different temporal frequencies and measurements in VTC will be
used to characterize optimal response frequencies. In Aim 3, we will test predictions of a previously proposed
model of feedforward drive and feedback modulation in VTC. We will present visual scenes while delivering
electrical stimulation of feedback pathways and measure changes in sEEG neural responses and behavioral
reaction times. This combination of electrical stimulation and visual perception allows us to test and refine an
extant model of how interactions between VTC and the intraparietal sulcus affect visual processing and
contribute to visual perception. Overall, this multidisciplinary proposal will deliver a set of empirical
measurements and models that describe the causal influence of feedback pathways on human VTC. These
studies will provide the groundwork for future research to design perturbation based strategies that mimic
human attentional conditions."
10930877,"Hydrocephalus is a common condition caused by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, with symptoms that include headaches, lethargy, seizures, coma, or death, and affects > 1 million patients in the United States. It is usually treated with the surgical implantation of a catheter, known as a ventricular shunt, which diverts the excess CSF in the brain to a distal absorptive site. Overall, 125,000 shunts are implanted or replaced annually in United States, with costs estimated at $2 billion per year. We have identified two unmet needs in hydrocephalus diagnostics: (i) precise, rapid, noninvasive way to monitor shunt function; (ii) a large gap in clinical knowledge of CSF hydrodynamics through shunts owing to a lack of a direct, continuous flow monitoring technology. To address this need, Rhaeos has developed the first wearable, wireless sensor for CSF flow monitoring. Our first platform, Flow Sense, exploits miniaturized thermal sensors and actuators to map thermal transport through the skin as a measure of subdermal fluid flow to make rapid spot checks to address the first challenge outlined above. Expanding these capabilities to include continuous monitoring, 24-hour of CSF flow, particularly during periods of sleep, would benefit the treatment, care and understanding of hydrocephalus. We hypothesize that continuous measurements will provide and allow for robust out-patient monitoring and enhancing in-patient monitoring capabilities, particularly in emergency departments. The resulting technology, if successful, could reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and lower in- patient stay periods by allowing for direct monitoring in patient homes. Additionally, understanding CSF hydrodynamics during sleep will be valuable in enhancing a basic scientific understanding of hydrocephalus and the glymphatic system. To address the goal, we will develop the first sensor capable of continuous, 24-hour CSF flow measurements. In the UG3 phase we will modify our hardware and software platform for safety, comfort, robustness, and usability for continuous, uninterrupted wear at home. Additionally, we will undertake DFMEA and design for manufacturability efforts in compliance with an FDA- and ISO13485 compliant quality management system. The completion and successful outsourced manufacturing run of a sensor capable of continuous use over 1 week will form the core of a set of go/no go milestones to transition to the clinical UH3 phase. In the UH3 phase, we will conduct a 1-week double-arm, single-center, blinded, longitudinal clinical study with historically stable shunt patients and patients with recent shunt revisions."
10909288,"Conformational switching associated with the conversion of a protein structure from a water-soluble to a
membrane-inserted form is a critical step in several cellular processes; our ability to predict and manipulate such
switching can be beneficial to human health. Notable examples of conformational switching include tumor
targeting by the pH Low Insertion Peptide (pHLIP), cellular entry of bacterial toxins, and membrane-induced
activation of the Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulators. While these processes are of fundamental biomedical
importance, the mechanism of conformational switching needs to be better understood. Specifically, the role of
lipid composition and divalent cations in modulating membrane insertion remains largely unexplored, despite the
mounting evidence of their physiological importance. We will test our hypothesis that changes in lipid
composition, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations, and pH play key roles in modulating conformational switching on
membrane interfaces. In Aim 1, we will decipher the thermodynamic rules for predicting protein-membrane
interactions by characterizing the protonation- and Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent bilayer partitioning of model peptides.
We will use our findings to advance the existing tools for sequence-based predictions of membrane interactions
and make them readily applicable to more realistic descriptions of the complex cellular environment. Specifically,
we strive to predict the effects of divalent cations and the changes in pKas of titratable amino acid residues on
membrane interfaces, which are critical for understanding membrane-dependent conformational rearrangements
that underlie the functioning of many systems of biomedical importance. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of
lipid composition in modulating the pH-dependent and Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent folding and transmembrane
insertion of pHLIP. This will include (a) deciphering the coupled effect of Ca2+/Mg2+ and lipid composition on
pHLIP targeting to model membranes, (b) determining the conformation of pHLIP-lipid complexes by molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations and spectroscopic experiments, (c) establish the role of individual acidic residues in
the conformational switching of pHLIP and (d) determining the protonation of anionic residues in membrane-
inserted pHLIP by NMR spectroscopy. In Aim 3, we will test whether the molecular determinants identified in
Aim 2 are sufficient to describe the behaviors of pHLIP in complex lipid systems containing de-mixed liquid
domains, and in mammalian cells (i.e., we will determine the effect of pH, divalent cations, PS, and cholesterol
on the interaction of pHLIP with cellular membranes)."

Lyme disease is an emerging tick-borne disease and an important public health problem in the
United States. The causative agent, Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), must dramatically alter its gene
expression as it traverses its enzootic cycle between the arthropod vector (Ixodes ticks) and rodent
mammalian hosts. In the past several years, the PI’s previous work discovered a central regulatory
pathway, the RpoS pathway, in B. burgdorferi. The RpoS pathway is a gatekeeper for B. burgdorferi
to exit from ticks and infect mammals. RpoS control many antigens and virulence factors for
mammalian infection. The PI’s previous work, along with others, demonstrated that transcriptional
activation of rpoS is under the control of the sigma factor 54 (σ54) and a bacterial enhancer-binding
protein (EBP), Rrp2. It is well established in other bacteria that EBP is essential and sufficient to
activate a σ54-type promoter both in vivo and in vitro. Surprisingly, another regulator, BosR, was
discovered independently by two groups a decade ago and showed that BosR directly regulates rpoS
transcription from its σ54-type promoter. How BosR fits into this pathway is a significant gap in our
understanding of the RpoS pathway. Based on our Preliminary Studies, we propose a provocative
hypothesis: BosR is not a transcriptional activator; instead, BosR is a novel RNA binding protein that
binds to rpoS mRNA and stabilizes its turnover. We will test this hypothesis in Aim 1. Given that few
factors have been identified for regulating the RpoS pathway, we have successfully developed a
genetic screen for identifying genes that influence the regulation of RpoS. Such screen allows us to
identify genome-wide novel factors that modulate the RpoS pathway, uncover a comprehensive
picture of how the RpoS pathway is regulated and how multi-signals influence the pathway in the
enzootic cycle of Bb between the tick vector and the mammalian host, which is proposed in Aim 2."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. It is characterized by the
progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta, and their projections onto
striatal neurons and the accumulation of α-Synuclein aggregates often into Lewy bodies. The pathogenesis of PD
is not fully elucidated but there is vast evidence supporting complex loops of neuroinflammatory cascades,
mitochondrial dysfunction, degenerating neurons, sustained microglial activation and other pathophysiological
mechanisms that together amplify a relentless progression towards neuronal loss in the nigra and beyond. α-
Synuclein (α-S) aggregates are implicated either directly in serving as a template that is transmitted
transneuronally and seeding further aggregation, and/or in amplifying the neuroinflammatory loop, leading in
both cases to neuronal dysfunction and death. To date, there are no therapeutic options that lead to the
regeneration of lost neurons or to the restoration of circuitry. Our group has pioneered the derivation of
functional dopamine neurons from human embryonic stem cells (hES) and we have just completed a Phase 1
clinical trial for the bilateral intrastriatal grafting of these cells. There is much excitement about the restorative
potential of stem cell derived neurons in PD, but there remain multiple challenges. Here we propose to study the
impact of microenvironmental alterations in the brain in the context of 2 different mouse models: the 3K mouse
model which expresses a triple mutant form of α-synuclein based on the human E46K mutation, and exhibits
histological hallmarks of PD as well as progressive motor and other behavioral abnormalities; the second model
consists of the intrastriatal injection of preformed α-synuclein fibrils (PFF) which spread transneuronally
through the brain to form pathogenic α-synuclein inclusions, leading to loss of DA neurons and behavioral
deterioration. These models are predicated on two different hypotheses and will serve as great tools to study
inflammation and its impact on behavior. In addition, we will graft the mice with the same hES cell derived
dopamine neurons used in the clinical trial to analyze the impact of the microenvironment on the neurons'
survival and phenotype, as well as on their ability to rescue behavior. We will capture grafted cells as well as host
microglia and astrocytes at key timepoints during the in vivo lifespan of the grafts to establish dynamic maps of
cell lineages, maturation, microglial and astrocytic phenotypes and potentially activation of neurotoxic signals.
In the last aim, we will engineer the human ES cells to delete the SNCA gene encoding α-synuclein in an attempt
at increasing the resistance of the grafts to neurotoxicity and potentially the transmission of pathogenic α-
synuclein. Data obtained in this proposal will serve to further enhance our understanding of neuro-inflammation
in different PD microenvironments and could result in enhanced strategies for cell grafting including the use of
gene edited cells that are resistant to neuroinflammation."
10896390,"Opioid drugs are essential medications for the relief of serious pain, with no substitutes currently available for
postsurgical and other severe indications. Long term use of opioids, however, leads to numerous side effects,
and to substantial risk of substance use disorder (SUD). SUD or “addiction” is diagnosed based on behavioral
characteristics that manifest broadly as loss of control or “compulsive” drug seeking and impaired decision making
or “cognitive flexibility” even after months to years of abstinence. However, the majority of preclinical research
of drug abuse focuses on models of drug-taking and reward-seeking rather than on the long-lasting changes in
behavioral flexibility that underlie human SUDs. In addition, preclinical studies of SUD mechanism have been
limited to comparing animals that have or have not taken drug. This has made it difficult to dissociate opioid-
induced changes in biology and behavior that occur merely due to drug exposure from those that actually underlie
the pathology of a SUD. We have developed a unique tool to circumvent this significant confound in opioid abuse
research. Specifically, we have developed a knock-in mouse that expresses a modified mu opioid receptor
(MOR) with altered signaling properties. The MOR when activated by its endogenous ligands, endorphins and
enkephalins, engages G protein signaling to control neuronal activity. Following G protein activation by
endogenous ligand, most G protein coupled receptors (GPCR), including the MOR, then rapidly recruit arrestins
that silence the G protein signal and promote receptor endocytosis and, for the MOR, rapid recycling. This
mechanism thereby carefully titrates G protein signal with a precision and time course ideally suited to respond
to transmitters that are released in a pulsatile manner. In contrast, MORs activated by morphine and all its
derivates effectively engage G protein signaling but poorly engage arrestins. In the current vernacular of GPCR
pharmacology, morphine is termed a “biased” agonist, signaling preferentially to G protein over arrestins while
endorphins are “balanced” agonists, engaging both G proteins and arrestins. The RMOR receptor was
engineered to effectively engage both G protein and arrestin when activated by morphine without altering
signaling in response to endogenous transmitters. Importantly, in our extensive previous work, we have found
that RMOR mice do not develop tolerance or dependence to morphine nor do they transition to compulsive drug
seeking in a model of SUD under conditions where wild type (WT) mice do. More recently, we have found while
morphine causes long-lasting changes in cognitive flexibility in WT mice, this effect is also absent in RMOR mice.
Here we will use WT and RMOR mice and single cell RNAseq to pinpoint molecular mechanisms that underlie
SUDs in a paradigm where all mice receive drug but only WT show pathologic morphine responses. We propose
that any morphine-induced changes that occur in both genotypes is likely to reflect a response to drug exposure,
whereas changes confined to WT mice likely contribute to the pathology of SUDs."

The health, social and economic issues associated with dementia, and the inequitable burden of dementia across
different racial/ethnic populations, are of such magnitude and complexity that they require a vantage point from
multiple disciplines. Generating scientific evidence to advance dementia health equity requires rigorous methods
applied to the best available data. The University of Southern California’s Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s
disease Related Dementias Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (USC AD/ADRD RCMAR) brings a
distinct capacity for integrating theories and tools from myriad disciplines including but not limited to economics,
sociology, and gerontology, using large, complex data sets, and applying rigorous panel data and quasi-
experimental methods to generate innovative AD/ADRD disparities research. Our interdisciplinary faculty have
the support and expertise to advance research in our focus area: pathways by which social, behavioral and
economic factors, and policies and health systems affect disparities in risk of AD/ADRD, and affect disparities in
the health, health care and economic outcomes of persons living with dementia. We build upon our successful
10-year history of advancing the research and careers of underrepresented scholars. We bring together the
infrastructure, leadership, interdisciplinary expertise and resources to: (1) increase the number, diversity, and
scholarly achievements of scholars of dementia health equity research and; (2) develop new, innovative lines of
research to advance dementia health equity. The USC AD/ADRD RCMAR is housed in the Schaeffer Center for
Health Policy and Economics, which brings together expertise in AD/ADRD from across USC’s schools, and
maintains a large data core, analytical programming team, and external affairs team to support AD/ADRD
research and disseminate findings for impact. To this we add resources and leaders from our partner NIA funded
centers: USC’s Roybal Center for Behavioral Interventions of Aging, Alzheimer Disease Research Center,
Center for Economic and Sociodemographic Study of AD/ADRD, and USC/UCLA Center on Biodemography
and Population Health. Importantly we have partnered with two HBCUs, Spelman College and Howard
University, and California State University Fullerton - an Hispanic and Latinx serving institution. Their junior
researchers and senior scholars and leaders are uniquely positioned to bring diverse perspectives and broaden
the field of AD/ADRD research. We propose a set of interrelated activities across three cores: (1) a Leadership
and Administration Core to provide leadership, management, communication, and evaluation systems for
achieving our goals; (2) a Research Education Core to selectively provided pilot research awards to junior
scientists and team-based mentorship and professional development to support rigorous research and enhance
the diversity of dementia disparities researchers; (3) an Analytical Core to develop new data and analytical
resources to support innovative dementia disparities research."
10879175,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anhedonia, a core symptom of depression and other forms of psychopathology characterized by loss of
interest or pleasure, is associated with a range of negative health outcomes, including suicide risk, and poor
treatment response. Low activation of positive valence systems, particularly low reward responsiveness (RR),
is a key brain-behavioral process underlying anhedonia. Critically, there is growing evidence that low RR is
observable in children at risk for anhedonia due to maternal symptomatology and reflects a vulnerability for the
later emergence of anhedonia and depression. Thus, targeting RR in high-risk children is critically needed to
prevent the development of anhedonia, alter risk trajectories, and mitigate the tremendous health burden of
anhedonia-related psychopathology. Combining principles from adult positive affect treatment and family
cognitive behavioral preventive interventions, we developed an innovative, neuroscience-informed dyadic
preventive intervention, Family Promoting Positive Emotions (F-PPE), for 8- to 12-year-old children and
mothers with a history of major depressive disorder with anhedonia. F-PPE is designed to specifically target
RR in children, assessed at the neural level using well-validated electroencephalogram methods. The first
phase of the project (R61) will focus on target engagement, testing whether F-PPE increases child neural RR
relative to an active comparison. Children (N=60) will complete neural measures of RR pre-intervention, 4-
weeks into the intervention to determine dose effects, and post-intervention (8 weeks). Biological mother-child
dyads will be randomized to F-PPE or a psychoeducation preventive intervention comparison. Target
engagement will be defined as an increase in neural RR in the F-PPE relative to psychoeducation group with
at least a medium effect size (d > .40). Change in the target at 4 weeks will be examined to determine dose
effects and integrated with participant feedback to refine F-PPE for the R33 phase. The R33 phase will be a
replication and extension to clinical outcomes with 100 biological mother-child dyads. Dyads will again be
randomized to F-PPE or a comparable number of psychoeducation sessions. In addition to neural RR,
ecological momentary assessment of real-world experiences of interest and pleasure and clinical symptoms of
anhedonia will be assessed pre- and post-intervention and at a 6-month follow-up assessment. We will
examine effects of F-PPE on momentary experiences of interest/pleasure and symptoms of anhedonia across
the longitudinal follow-up and test change in RR as a mechanism of clinical effects of F-PPE. These projects
will take critical next steps in translating developmental affective neuroscience research to prevention and
moving towards precision medicine to reduce the burden of anhedonia and associated psychopathologies."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy but remain effective in only a
subset of patients and tumor types. The successful treatment of tumors that lack T cell infiltration, known as
immunologically cold tumors, remains a major roadblock in cancer immunotherapy. Tumor mutational burden
has been correlated with ICI efficacy due to the abundance of neoantigens that are recognizable by the
immune system after ICI. This proposal aims to enhance the visibility of multiple tumor types with low
mutational burden by inducing the expression of neoantigens through RNA editing approaches. Our
preliminary data in a highly aggressive, immunologically cold model of murine melanoma show that the
combination of RNA editing and anti-PD-1 ICI results in a significant survival benefit over anti-PD-1 alone. We
hypothesize that the induction of neoantigens enhances T cell infiltration into the tumor and promotes epitope
spreading such that the immune system recognizes endogenous tumor antigens in addition to induced
neoantigens. We will test this hypothesis with two specific aims. Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanism of action
of this novel cancer immunotherapy through transcriptomic profiling of isolated tumor cells, analysis of tumor-
infiltrating immune cells, and evaluation of the abscopal effect whereby growth of a distant tumor is suppressed
following localized treatment of the primary tumor. Aim 2 will determine the generalizability of this approach to
additional immunologically cold murine cancer models as well as its translation to human cancers through
evaluation in multiple patient-derived tumor organoids. The successful completion of these aims would provide
preclinical validation and further support the advancement of this innovative approach. This strategy has the
potential to diversify the neoantigen repertoire and expand ICIs as frontline therapies in many tumor types,
improving clinical outcomes for cancer patients."
10893574,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung function measurements are routinely compared to racial/ethnic norms, biasing interpretation and
perpetuating asthma disparities. The race/ethnicity-based lung function reference equations used to calculate
these norms do not account for genetic ancestry—the genetic origin of one’s population, which can explain over
15% of lung function variation within a racial/ethnic group. Consequently, race/ethnicity-based equations
misestimate lung function, often resulting in delayed disease detection and inadequate treatment, especially
among populations disproportionately affected by asthma. Dr. Witonsky (candidate) derived equations that use
genetic ancestry instead of race/ethnicity to more accurately predict lung function. While genetic ancestry-
informed equations appear to remove racial/ethnic bias from lung function measurement, establishing their
clinical utility and equity requires evidence that they better predict asthma-related outcomes. In addition, further
research is needed to disentangle the social and genetic determinants of genetic ancestry differences in lung
function. The proposed mentored research will address these knowledge gaps using data from existing and new
cohorts of Black and Hispanic/Latino individuals with and without asthma via three specific aims: (1) to evaluate
genetic ancestry-informed, race/ethnicity-based, and “one size fits all” lung function equations for predicting
asthma-related outcomes, (2) to quantify the proportion of genetic ancestry differences in lung function that is
explained by social exposures, and (3) to quantify the proportion of genetic ancestry differences in lung function
that is explained by known lung function-associated genetic loci. In support of this research and Dr. Witonsky’s
goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, this K23 proposal includes formal training with experts in
the areas of asthma translational and clinical research (Dr. Prescott Woodruff, primary mentor); advanced
statistical and predictive analytic methods (Dr. Stephen Shiboski, co-mentor); social epidemiology and health
disparities research (Dr. Luísa Borrell, co-mentor); genetic epidemiology (Dr. Elad Ziv, co-mentor); and statistical
genetics (Dr. Noah Zaitlen, advisor). In addition, professional development planning will involve structured
meetings with Dr. Woodruff and a leader within Dr. Witonsky’s Division of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology, and
Bone Marrow Transplant (Dr. Morna Dorsey, advisor). As a faculty member in the Department of Pediatrics at
the University of California, San Francisco, Dr. Witonsky will have access to world-class biomedical and research
facilities, workshops and seminars, and an NCATS-funded K Scholars Program. Completion of the proposed
research and career development activities in this application will inform the development of an R01 proposal
and enable Dr. Witonsky to develop an innovative research program applying computational precision health
methods that integrate clinical, social, and genomic data to reduce asthma disparities."
10728872,"As stroke is a leading cause of disability among veterans, there is a compelling need to develop
treatments that improve motor ability after a stroke affects those brain networks relevant to motor function.
Our goal is to improve motor function after stroke through methods that combine brain stimulation with
practice. To advance this goal we need an understanding of the network changes that underlie recovery of
useful motor behaviors such as reaching. Non- primary cortical motor areas have been shown to have
strong connections with other motor areas, including the primary motor cortex, and there is some evidence
that their functional role changes after stroke. We and others have also demonstrated the ability to influence
reaching behavior with focal cortical stimulation, and to influence the cortical representation of reaching
movement through the combination of cortical stimulation with reaching practice.
We will use this new knowledge and increase our understanding of brain network changes and the effects
of brain stimulation and practice by completing the following three aims: 1. Quantify effects of disrupting
activity in PMd and PMv in each hemisphere during reaching tasks in participants with and without
capsular stroke. The functional role of each region will be assessed through the effects of brief trains of
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the dorsal and ventral premotor areas of each hemisphere
during reaching tasks in human participants with and without capsular stroke. The specifics of white
matter damage will influence which region on each side affects connectivity most. 2. Quantify connectivity
with M1 and other motor regions in human participants with and without capsular stroke. This will be
assessed by resting state & task-related connectivity using fMRI, and will demonstrate differences between
the three types of functional connectivity measures: TMS regional effects on motor output, resting state
fMRI, and dynamic causal models of task-related fMRI. The relationship between motor function and
functional connectivity will therefore have been tested. 3. Evaluate the effects of movement-
synchronized TMS of the most facilitatory region on the effects of practice on motor output and
behavioral performance. TMS of the most functionally relevant premotor region will be synchronized with
practice of the affected upper extremity. An innovative feature of this work is the study of internal capsule
stroke, which is a more homogeneous and appropriate population than the overall set of stroke types that
affect movement, which has a great deal of variety. These findings will allow us to formulate clear
hypotheses about which premotor area should be modulated after stroke, and when, in the context of
movement practice. We will be able to design a novel treatment protocol that delivers precisely timed
stimulation during practice of reaching movements."

Age related hearing loss is insidious, common and often mistaken as an inevitable part of aging. Untreated
hearing loss is a public health issue, and is strongly associated with social isolation and an array of negative
health effects including cognitive impairment and poor quality of life. Given its insidious and typically
unrecognized onset, opportunities to address hearing-related communication difficulties are often missed in
primary care where most older persons receive medical care.
Primary care settings may be an effective setting to address age-related hearing loss, given that many adults
have not sought hearing treatment within the current model of hearing health delivery, or ever had hearing
screening. The current model of audiological care lacks efficiency and scalability to address the true burden of
this chronic condition. Hearing aids are in limited use due to cost and logistics limiting access and this is
particularly relevant to those with the greatest need. Newer, more innovative pathways to deliver hearing care
are needed.
The overall goals of this GEMSSTAR application are to: 1) test the feasibility of a hearing program including
screening and alternative rehabilitation strategies to in older adults in public hospital-based primary care clinic
using a convergent mixed method design. 2) establish the first steps needed for an implementation science
career in hearing healthcare disparities from the perspective of an otologist/ear specialist to improve the quality
and equity of hearing care for older adults.
During a primary care visit, we will screen and identify participants with hearing loss and then randomize to a)
counseling on accessible assistive listening devices or b) referral to traditional audiology care pathway alone.
Feasibility measures will demonstrate our ability to screen patients, randomize them to interventions and
complete the follow up in preparation for a larger efficacy trial on the impact of this program on hearing and
communication. Future work will seek to demonstrate improvement in longer-term outcomes impacting overall
biopsychosocial health."

Nucleic acids (NAs) are the major information carrying molecules of life. The ability to use
computation to model the structure, dynamic and interactions of DNA and RNA is a key adjunct
to experimental study of these biomolecules. For example, pseudouridine-containing mRNA
vaccines against Covid-19 are a critical tool in battling the pandemic. DNAs, mRNAs, and
miRNAs are targets for a number of antibacterial and antiviral drugs. Design of small molecule
drugs binding to nucleic acids in the treatment of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases is
one of the hottest topics of current pharmaceutical research. Under this project, we will
investigate several key aspects of nucleic acids, and develop the polarizable multipole
AMOEBA+ model for simulation of NAs and their interactions. This new force field will be further
enhanced via coupling of a machine learning-based potential for local valence features with
classical long-range nonbonded interactions. The resulting AMOEBA+NN force field promises
chemical accuracy in the calculation of binding for NA systems. Parameters for the AMOEBA+
and AMOEBA+NN potentials will be generated using the new, automated Poltype2 package.
Implementation of the force fields into the existing GPU-capable Tinker9 molecular dynamics
software will enable state-of-the-art simulation and binding free energy estimation.
The applicability of molecular simulation to design of therapeutics is limited by efficiency and
accuracy of the calculations. The objective of this proposal is to enable routine, accurate
computation of the thermodynamics of binding of small-molecule ligands to NAs. Toward that
end, several current systems of biological relevance will be investigated, including binding of
metal ions to G-quadruplex structures, fluorogenic ligands with RNA aptamers, novel antibiotic
drugs with the FMN riboswitch, and conformational dynamics of the P5abc domain of the
Tetrahymena group I ribozyme. The structures and functions of NAs are highly dependent upon
their ionic environment. The interplay between RNA local structural dynamics and global/tertiary
folding is an intriguing question being addressed experimentally. The ability to simulate these
complex energetic effects in the design of novel small molecule drugs and synthetically modified
oligonucleotides will be an important growth area for future medical advances. Development of
the accurate and transferable next-generation AMOEBA+ and AMOEBA+NN force fields will
open new paths toward understand and prediction of the behavior of natural and designed
nucleic acid molecules."
10857195,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Contractile force in the heart is generated by densely packed subcellular structures known as sarcomeres.
Mutations in sarcomeric genes have been repeatedly linked to potentially lethal conditions known as
cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM) forms. Optimal clinical management of
HCM/DCM requires identification of at-risk individuals before they experience symptoms. Genetic testing can
be useful, but results are not always definitive enough to support clinical decision making. This is because
genetic variants found in patients are often unique to their family. These so-called variants of unknown
significance (VUS) could be pathogenic or benign. Unfortunately, testing each VUS experimentally is
prohibitively expensive, and generic pathogenicity algorithms are proving unreliable for prediction of
cardiomyopathies. The goal of this proposal is to create an accurate and scalable computational method for
classifying sarcomeric variants of unknown significance so that more HCM/DCM families can benefit from
genetic screening and early diagnosis. Our long-term approach to solving this critical shortcoming is to create a
computational pipeline to predict pathogenicity of novel sarcomeric gene variants, providing cardiologists with a
biophysical basis for performing risk stratification in HCM/DCM patient families. Our work during the last
funding period was focused specifically on mutations to the protein tropomyosin (Tpm), leading to important
milestones in genotype-phenotype predictive modeling. For this renewal, we aim to expand these capabilities
to include characterization of highly prevalent VUS in Tpm’s binding partners, troponin I (TnI) and troponin T
(TnT). This will widen the impact of our work, encompassing families with VUS in TPM1, TNNI3, or TNNT2.
Breakthroughs documented in our recent published work on the actin/Tpm/troponin regulatory complex have
allowed us to construct increasingly precise maps of the binding interactions among these proteins at an
atomic level, including the specific amino acid sidechains upon which binding and regulatory function depend.
Our hypothesis is that these refined structural interaction maps will allow us to make more accurate predictions
of thin filament VUS pathogenicity using our computational pipeline. We will test this hypothesis in three aims.
Aim 1 experiments will extend our preliminary tests of the interacting pairs hypothesis through the study of 18
additional mutations scattered strategically across our three proteins of interest. In Aim 2, twelve mutations in
TPM1, TNNT2, and TNNI3 that are known to produce clinical disease in humans will be analyzed in our dual
computational/experimental pipeline. These real-world cases will make it possible to define what constitutes a
meaningful mutation-induced change in muscle function. Having established model accuracy (Aim 1) and
thresholds of pathogenicity (Aim 2), in Aim 3 we will perform a computational screen of 200+ VUS from the
ClinVar database and validate twelve of these HCM/DCM pathogenicity predictions in engineered heart
tissues. This project will continue our successful efforts to achieve sarcomeric genotype-phenotype predictions."
10899685,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In many lung diseases--including asthma--excessive mucus disrupts clearance and obstructs airflow, but mucus
dysfunction is not effectively treated by existing therapies. The chief macromolecules in airway mucus are
MUC5AC and MUC5B. To study them causatively, we made Muc5ac and Muc5b knockout mice. We discovered
that Muc5b is required for mucociliary clearance (MCC) in health, but Muc5ac is dispensable. Instead, Muc5ac
causes mucus plugging and is required for airway hyperreactivity (AHR) in models of asthma. Nonetheless, despite
its homeostatic requirements in mice and humans, we now know that excessive MUC5B/Muc5b can itself be
detrimental in lung fibrosis (PF). These findings show significance, but they also highlight the need to find ways to
prevent mucus dysfunction while also preserving defense. We postulate that this can be accomplished in part
through an improved understanding of MUC5AC and MUC5B assembly mechanisms.
 MUC5AC/Muc5ac and MUC5B/Muc5b are very large proteins that form even larger polymers via linkages
between their carboxyl (C-) and amino (N-) termini. Their pathologic properties depend on covalent disulfide bonds
whose reduction reverses AHR and improves MCC, suggesting that therapeutic intervention targets could be
revealed by determining precisely how mucins assemble. Mucin C- and N-terminal polymerization domains are
homologous with the protein von Willebrand Factor (VWF). Cysteines required for VWF assembly are conserved in
mucins. We have identified which are required for airway mucin assembly and function. Here we seek to continue
determine structural requirements and cellular mechanisms for mucin polymerization and function.
 Emerging data suggest that a cluster of three cysteines referred to as a “cysteine triad” is crucial. One of
member of the triad is the cysteine that forms an inter-molecular disulfide. This requires the acidic environment
provided in the Golgi to facilitate disulfide exchanges that liberate cysteines needed for intermolecular disulfides.
Low pH also protonates histidines in domains that surround the triad. The cysteine triads and pH-sensing histidines
in VWF are conserved in mucins. We hypothesize that airway polymeric mucin biosynthesis is regulated by Golgi
specific mechanisms that mediate mucus function and dysfunction. We will test this by 1) examining how assembly
is regulated by Golgi-localized cysteine-triad dependent mechanisms, 2) determining the conserved histidine
residues are required for pH-dependent N-terminal assembly, and 3) demonstrating how these affect mucin
polymerization airway mucus functions. Studies here will advance the mucin biology field while laying groundwork
for approaches to prevent mucus dysfunction while preserving defense. While research here focuses on asthma,
results will have implications for diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), CF, and other
conditions where mucus dysfunction is prevalent."

Natural product leads from marine life continue to inspire new drugs, with nine approved for clinical use since
2010. A historical challenge with developing marine organism-derived bioactive chemicals has been one of
limited supply. Often, natural drug leads are isolated from rare or environmentally sensitive marine invertebrates
and algae, which challenges the pre-clinical evaluation of promising candidates when demands outweigh natural
supplies. Some terrestrial plant-derived drugs can now be produced in genetically engineered microbial cell
factories, an approach that would be attractive for marine-derived molecules. However, the biosynthetic
machinery responsible for the biosynthesis of bioactive natural products in marine animals and algae is largely
unknown. Until now. We have discovered and validated the first steps of biosynthetic pathways in corals and
algae that lead to over 6,000 terpenoids, including the anti-inflammatory pseudopterosin and anticancer
halomon. We propose a multidisciplinary project to investigate the molecular basis of terpenoid diversification in
marine eukaryotes that harbor terpenoids with promising biological properties. Significant outcomes of this
research project will include a new paradigm for terpenoid biosynthetic logic in marine eukaryotes, and the
application of this basic knowledge toward the microbial production of marine animal and algal molecules. We
propose three specific aims, namely: 1) To develop a marine eukaryotic genome mining platform for algae and
corals; 2) To functionally characterize marine eukaryotic terpene synthases for high yield terpene production;
and 3) To discover and characterize terpene tailoring enzymes (halogenation/oxygenation) associated with
bioactive coral and algal natural products."
10857341,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer and chronic virus infections are significant causes of morbidity and mortality. While cytotoxic CD8 T
cells are the main killers of tumors or virus-infected cells, persistent stimulation of CD8 T cells during chronic
infections or cancer results in a gradual loss of their cytotoxic function as T cells progress towards a fully-
exhausted state. While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy allows partially-exhausted CD8 T cells to
functionally recover by blocking inhibitory signals, terminally-exhausted T cells remain nonresponsive to this
therapy. The inability of terminally-exhausted T cells to recover after ICB may explain why many cancer patients
fail to mount durable responses to ICB. We recently showed that de novo DNA methylation programming is
causally linked to the progression of T cells toward terminal exhaustion and poor response to ICB. Importantly,
we discovered that targeting T cell-intrinsic epigenetic programs synergized the efficacy of ICB during chronic
infection or cancer. Yet, the following questions represent major gaps in our current understanding of T cell
exhaustion: (1) How are these epigenetic changes acquired in exhausted T cells? (2) What are the upstream
signals that regulate the specificity of de novo DNA methylation programs in exhausted versus functional T cells?
(3) Can we reverse the epigenetic programming in exhausted T cells to the functional state while avoiding
transformation? Bridging these gaps will allow us to identify and target factors that apply “epigenetic brakes” to
CD8 T cell function. To address these questions, we have developed a novel in-vitro model of stable human T
cell dysfunction as a tractable tool that can guide our in-vivo experiments by providing first-line mechanistic
studies. First, we will employ cutting-edge approaches, such as CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and retroviral
transduction, to test the hypothesis that specific tumor microenvironmental signals regulate epigenetic
programming in persistently stimulated CD8 T cells, which promotes their resistance to ICB therapy. We aim to
block and/or revert the progression toward the terminally-exhausted state by targeting components of this
signaling pathway while promoting counteracting pathways. Second, we aim to rebalance specific
microenvironmental signals to restore functionality and response in terminally-exhausted T cells. Using novel in-
vitro model systems of T cell dysfunction and complementary in-vivo models of chronic viral infection and cancer,
as well as cutting-edge technologies to profile DNA methylation, open chromatin landscape, and transcriptome
in CD8 T cells, our proposed studies can determine if targeting specific factors can remodel chromatin back into
an accessible state at effector and/or stemness-associated genes, leading to functionally-rejuvenated T cells.
These proposed studies will provide insights into how epigenetic programming can be reversed during
progression to T cell exhaustion that can be translated to reprogram terminally-exhausted T cells in clinical
settings, ultimately enhancing the efficacy of T cell immunotherapies."

Despite broad availability and extensive use of the vaccine Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) and sterilizing
chemotherapies, tuberculosis (TB) remains responsible for more than 1.5 million deaths annually. Although
COVID-19 caused more deaths than TB in 2020 and 2021, TB is expected to resume the position it held for most
of the last 100 years as the leading cause of death associated with an infectious agent. The mechanisms through
which Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) successfully evades vaccines and effective chemotherapies remain
unknown. We hypothesize that Mtb persister cells enter a physiological state that prevents them from
succumbing to death and sterilization. This proposal will use in vitro and in vivo models to dissect the
mechanisms enabling persistence, building on our preliminary data showing that persistence is a multifactorial
phenomenon involving amino acid metabolism, other metabolic pathways, interactions with the host immune
response, and effects on bacterial chromosome structure. Persisters were first identified as the 0.1% to 1% of
streptococci and staphylococci that survive treatment with the bacteriocidal antibiotic penicillin. We have
established similar, highly robust, reproducible models for isolating Mtb persisters using either isoniazid (INH) or
amikacin. In our INH model, 99% to 99.9% of Mtb cells are killed within 3 days of in vitro exposure. Microarray
analysis of surviving cells revealed a defined stress-associated signature. We compared the RNA sequencing
results for amikacin and INH persisters to those for Mtb under other persister-inducing conditions, including
hypoxia, nutrient starvation, and stationary phase. We found 25 commonly upregulated genes, which we
hypothesize are important genes for persister formation. We propose to construct deletion mutants for all 25
genes to define pathways leading to persistence. We further hypothesize that Mtb persisters evolved to prevent
sterilization by the adaptive immune response, supported by our studies of a new conditionally immune-sterilized
auxotrophic (CIMSAUX) Mtb mutant that contains deletions in methionine, leucine, and pantothenate
biosynthesis genes. The CIMSAUX mutant persists indefinitely in immunocompromised mice but is sterilized in
immunocompetent mice. The genetic factors contributing to the CIMSAUX mutant phenotype will be analyzed,
and additional CIMSAUX mutants will be isolated. Novel fluorescent reporter constructs will be engineered to
monitor the growth and persistence of the multiple mutants generated in this study. We present preliminary
evidence that deletion of the gene encoding the structural maintenance of the chromosome (SMC) protein in Mtb
results in a persister formation–defective mutant (Mtb Δsmc), suggesting that Mtb chromosome structure
contributes to persister formation. To test this hypothesis, we will delete genes with the potential to impact
chromosome structure in wild-type Mtb and Mtb Δsmc and test their persister capacities in vitro and in mouse
models. These studies will (i) provide new insights into the Mtb persister phenotype, (ii) generate valuable models
for investigating persistence, and (iii) lead to improved strategies for sterilizing Mtb infections."

The continuous adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 generates variants of concern (VOC). New VOCs arise
independently and outcompete previous ones, consistent with ever increasing viral fitness. Most VOC
adaptations reside in the spikes (S), the complex multidomain glycoprotein trimers that bind viruses to cells
and mediate virus-cell membrane fusion. Well-characterized adaptations in the S receptor binding domains
(RBDs) alter RBD structural dynamics, receptor affinities, and antibody interactions. However, adaptations in
other S domains remain largely under-evaluated. This includes the S2 domains that execute virus-cell
membrane fusion. This proposal aims to elucidate consequences of VOC adaptive changes in the S2 domains.
The current VOC, omicron (o), has accumulated over six S2 mutations. Our central objective is to evaluate the
ways these and other S2 adaptations alter S protein dynamics to facilitate human cell entry. We will utilize a
collection of viral membrane fusion and cell entry assay systems to determine whether S2 changes reset the
dynamics of transient S protein intermediate states. These transitory states include RBD elevations that control
receptor binding and S2 refoldings from prefusion to fusion intermediate and through to postfusion
configurations. Our assay systems will employ fusion-competent virus-like particles (VLPs) for sensitive
evaluation of entry steps, soluble receptors as probes for RBD exposures, HR2 peptides for detection of
specific S transitional intermediates, replication-competent VSVSARS-CoV-2-S for selecting HR2 peptide-resistant
variants, and SARS-CoV-2 replicons and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses for convincingly assigning specific
S2 amino acid substitutions to consequential redirection of virus-cell entry pathways.
Our preliminary results suggest that omicron S2 adaptations operate allosterically to alter S-receptor
interactions. The first aim will determine how S2 fusion domains control RBDs and their interactions
with receptors. We will identify specific VOC S2 mutations that control receptor reactivity and S stability. We
will determine how these mutations change viral entry requirements. Our initial results also suggest that
omicron S2 mutations change the pace of the conformational transitions facilitating membrane fusion. The
second aim will determine how S2 mutations control dynamics of fusion domains. We will determine
whether the rates of S2 structural transitions vary between VOCs. We will also select and characterize variants
resistant to inhibitors of the S2 structural dynamics and will find out whether these resistant variants have
unique requirements for the receptors and proteases that determine cell susceptibility to infection.
The results of this study will clarify currently obscure selective forces driving the human adaptation of past (α,
β, γ, δ), current (ο), and future VOCs. We expect the results will illuminate properties of the membrane fusion –
inducing S2 domains in ways that reveal new targets for inhibition of CoV entry."

The rapid adoption of genetically modified animals and fluorescently labeled biocompatible nanoparticles for
drug delivery in biomedical science have increased demand for imaging technologies capable of fast
volumetric imaging to enable longitudinal investigations of cell dynamics in their natural environment. The
complexity of information required to understand tissue response to injury and treatment has also generated
increased interest in multimodal imaging systems that combine complementary performance strengths.
In this regard, we have developed an integrated dual-modality imaging system that combines optical
coherence microscopy (OCM) and dual-channel confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) to enable the
simultaneous measurements of fluorescence and reflectance from deep tissue layers. The combined system
provides a unique opportunity to inform cells’ behavior in their natural environment by offering complementary
information not available with either system alone. CFM interogates the distribution of fluorescently labeled
molecules in cells. OCM is a label-free, episcopic method providing information about the cell boundaries,
extracellular matrix, and thickness changes in layers of normal and pathogenic tissues.
Despite its potential, the integration of these technologies is incomplete without the capability of concurrent
volumetric imaging allowing the tracking of cell dynamics progressively in the same specimen. As for scanning-
based systems, fast volumetric imaging in OCM and CFM requires dynamic focusing at the level of individual
scanning points, which is challenging due to the limited temporal resolution of dynamic focusing devices.
This project aims to establish the capability of the tunable acoustic gradient lens, the fastest dynamic
focusing technology to date, in OCM and CFM to enable a fast volumetric and concurrent imaging of
depth-resolved reflectance and fluorescence from deep tissue layers in vivo. This integration will have a
tremendous impact on biomedical research as OCM and CFM technologies remain the most affordable, flexible,
and the latter is readily available in many research facilities. We propose the following two specific aims:
Aim 1: Enable fast volumetric imaging in confocal fluorescence microscopy.
Aim 2: Enable extended depth-of-field in optical coherence microscopy.
Significance
The ability to concurrently acquire volumetric information such as reflectance and fluorescence rapidly from
deep tissue layers will provide a powerful tool for longitudinal investigations into developmental and
pathophysiological mechanisms in various research fields and facilitate in vivo cell tracking in the same
specimen while increasing the rigor and reproducibility of studies by decreasing the inter-subject variability that
can affect the outcomes of cellular processes."

Most colorectal cancer (CRC) patients do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies due to poor T
cell infiltration and an immune suppressive environment. The pathological characteristics of CRC are unique due
to the complex microbiome in the tumor microenvironment. Diverse bacterial species and metabolites in the
tumor can alter the activity and function of infiltrating immune cells, regulating the tumor's immune environment.
Therefore, understanding how tumor-enriched metabolites change the immune environment is crucial for
developing novel microbiota/metabolite intervention approaches.
We observed that macrophages resembling an M2-like phenotype are in a higher proportion in CRC samples
compared to patient-matched normal tissues. Our metabolomic analysis of CRC tissues showed increases in
essential amino acids, which strongly correlate with altered macrophage phenotype. Further, monocytes
exposed to tumor-enriched metabolites such as tryptophan and phenylalanine increase markers associated with
immunosuppressive macrophages. However, whether microbial-derived metabolites alter macrophage
polarization and contribute to immunosuppressive phenotypes, which can influence the immune environment in
CRC, remains unknown. We hypothesize that altered enrichment of metabolites in CRC correlates with
immunosuppressive macrophages and that critical tumor-enriched metabolites modulate the macrophage
phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will assess the impact of tumor-enriched metabolites on macrophage phenotype. In
Aim 2, we will functionally validate key metabolites influencing macrophage polarization in CRC organoid
coculture models.
We will use a metabolite screening approach using human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
healthy donors and CRC patients to assess whether tumor-enriched metabolites can promote
immunosuppressive macrophage phenotypes. In addition, we will use human microsatellite stable and
microsatellite instable CRC organoids cocultured with patients matched undifferentiated monocytes and tumor-
enriched metabolites to assess shifts in macrophage subtypes. We will identify critical metabolites that can alter
macrophage phenotype and function, contributing to a sustained immunosuppressive tumor environment.
Impact. Determining interactions between tumor-enriched metabolites and macrophage phenotype will increase
the clinical implications of this study by solidifying the premise that the immune environment can be manipulated
by endogenous metabolic regulation."

The health, social and economic issues associated with dementia, and the inequitable burden of dementia across
different racial/ethnic populations, are of such magnitude and complexity that they require a vantage point from
multiple disciplines. Generating scientific evidence to advance dementia health equity requires rigorous methods
applied to the best available data. The University of Southern California’s Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s
disease Related Dementias Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (USC AD/ADRD RCMAR) brings a
distinct capacity for integrating theories and tools from myriad disciplines including but not limited to economics,
sociology, and gerontology, using large, complex data sets, and applying rigorous panel data and quasi-
experimental methods to generate innovative AD/ADRD disparities research. Our interdisciplinary faculty have
the support and expertise to advance research in our focus area: pathways by which social, behavioral and
economic factors, and policies and health systems affect disparities in risk of AD/ADRD, and affect disparities in
the health, health care and economic outcomes of persons living with dementia. We build upon our successful
10-year history of advancing the research and careers of underrepresented scholars. We bring together the
infrastructure, leadership, interdisciplinary expertise and resources to: (1) increase the number, diversity, and
scholarly achievements of scholars of dementia health equity research and; (2) develop new, innovative lines of
research to advance dementia health equity. The USC AD/ADRD RCMAR is housed in the Schaeffer Center for
Health Policy and Economics, which brings together expertise in AD/ADRD from across USC’s schools, and
maintains a large data core, analytical programming team, and external affairs team to support AD/ADRD
research and disseminate findings for impact. To this we add resources and leaders from our partner NIA funded
centers: USC’s Roybal Center for Behavioral Interventions of Aging, Alzheimer Disease Research Center,
Center for Economic and Sociodemographic Study of AD/ADRD, and USC/UCLA Center on Biodemography
and Population Health. Importantly we have partnered with two HBCUs, Spelman College and Howard
University, and California State University Fullerton - an Hispanic and Latinx serving institution. Their junior
researchers and senior scholars and leaders are uniquely positioned to bring diverse perspectives and broaden
the field of AD/ADRD research. We propose a Leadership and Administration Core (LAC) to provide visionary
leadership and management for effective implementation of activities of LAC, Research Education and Analysis
Cores; to support the selection of junior scientists and their pilot research proposals to meet goals of rigor in
research and enhance diversity of dementia health equity scholars; evaluate mentorship and scholarship
activities to learn and improve our practices; to structure and maintain active and effective internal and external

Dysregulated Th2 responses are central to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. The central dogma is that
classical dendritic cells (cDCs) are the primary drivers of Th2 cells, this has been largely established using
strategies targeting CD11c, which while expressed by cDCs, is also present by other cells like monocytes and
macrophages. Our data demonstrates the existence of population of MafB+CD11c+MHCIIhi interstitial
macrophages (MHCIIhi IMs), significantly induced in response to house dust mite (HDM). Thus, previous
strategies aimed at cDCs may have co-targeted these IMs. Using specific targeting, we show for the first time
that these MHCIIhi IMs are central to driving allergen-induced Th2 responses in the airways. Our data propose
that the development of Th2 immunity, which has long been the purview of dendritic cells, now includes a central
role for MHCIIhi IMs. Consistently, we also find that HLA-DRhi macrophages are elevated in the tissue of patients
with allergic nasal polyps. Although their regulation during allergy is not understood. Using chemogenetic
approaches, we find that pulmonary innervation emanating from the vagal ganglia (VG) directly induces MHCIIhi
IM accumulation during HDM-induced allergic airway inflammation, strongly indicating that VG neurons
contribute to IM accumulation in response to allergen. Therefore, vagal ganglion-neuropeptide-IM crosstalk acts
as a potential axis mediating airway allergy. Exploring the bioenergetics of these cells, we find that MHCIIhi IMs
appear to rely heavily on glucose metabolism for function. They express the highest levels of glycolysis-
associated genes, and impairing glucose metabolism decreases their ability to take up HDM, something not seen
in cDCs in vivo, suggesting that IMs are intrinsically different than cDCs in their reliance on glycolysis for antigen-
presenting function. Further, blocking glycolysis reduces eosinophils, Th2 cells, and IgE, but not neutrophils,
cDCs, or IL-13+ILCs. Lastly, we found that HDM-elicited MHCIIhi IMs are also highly enriched for arginase-1, a
canonical marker of M2 macs, more so than any other myeloid cell type, including AMs. We postulate that innate
cytokines act as microenvironmental signals that condition IMs, favoring the development of Th2 cells. Seeking
to understand this mechanism, we found that IMs express high levels of the IL-33 receptor, ST2 and eliminating
IL-33 signaling impacts arg1+IMs, but not total IMs. Moreover, we found that neuronal inputs induce ST2
expression, thus sensitizing macs to IL-33. In sum, we hypothesize that HDM-elicited IL-33 promotes an M2-like
polarization state, favoring an MHCIIhi IM-T cell dialog that drive Th2 responses. To examine this, we propose
to: 1) Examine the neuronal pathways regulating MHCIIhi IM accumulation, 2) Examine the glycolytic program of
MHCIIhi IMs, and test its requirement for Th2 responses, 3) test neuropeptide-IL-33 axis that drives alternative
MHCIIhi IMs polarization favoring Th2 development."

Genetic disruptions such as pathogenic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in clock genes can perturb
circadian rhythms and cause sleep disorders. For example, the tau mutation in the CK1ε gene causes dramatic
shortening of the wake-sleep cycle in animals, ~20 hrs instead of normal 24 hrs. The same mutation has been
reported as a SNP in humans. Because the circadian clock mechanism is conserved across mammalian
species, affected humans would be predicted to have the same altered sleep cycle. Structural and biochemical
assays have predicted many potentially pathogenic mutations exist for clock genes. However, we do not yet
understand the in vivo significance of these potentially pathogenic mutations. A critical bottleneck in studying
the pathogenesis of genetic disruptions is lack of an efficient in vivo system that uses cell models instead of
resource-intensive, live animal models.
Aim 1. Develop an efficient platform to study mammalian clock mechanisms and identify pathological
mutations. To test the hypothesis that functionality of SNPs in clock genes can be studied in a human cell-
based platform, we generated endogenous Per1-luc and Per2-luc reporters in U2OS cells where diverse SNPs
will be generated and assessed accurately. We have validated the system by confirming consistent knockout
phenotypes between our reporter cells and mice, and reproducing similar phenotypes with known mutations.
Our system will be further validated by comparing phenotypes of the SNPs between two cell models, U2OS
and mPer2Luc MEFs.
Aim 2. Elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of critical mutations in CK1δ, CK1ε, Clock and Bmal1
genes. We will use our platform to test hypotheses on quantifiable changes previously proposed for specific
mutations in clock genes encoding CK1δ/ε, CLOCK and BMAL1. The majority of these mutations have not yet
been validated and quantified in in vivo models. We will focus on these mutations and dozens of SNPs at or
near these sites that could be as disruptive as the mutations identified by previous studies.
Aim 3. Develop a novel, specific treatment approach for circadian sleep disorders associated with
pathological SNPs . Current approaches to treat jet-lag or reset sleep cycles include light therapy, melatonin
and a few experimental drugs, none of which are specific to the clock and proven to be effective for circadian
disorders. We hypothesize that rapid degradation of limiting clock proteins using PROTACs can counteract the
pathogenicity of SNP mutations such that the clock is modulated to compensate the pathogenicity.
In summary, as we are now aware that human physiology is greatly impacted by defective clock mechanisms
associated with pathological SNPs in clock genes and CRISPR allows efficient genome editing, it is imperative
and timely to develop an efficient cell-based platform to study pathogenicity of these clinical SNPs."

Ning Hua, PhD, is an MRI scientist whose overarching career goal is to become an independent investigator in
the field of microvascular dysfunction and its relationship to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and aging brain. The
proposed K01 research combines advanced in vivo dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI and novel ex vivo
Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and aims to explore how trauma-
induced hippocampal microvascular injury accelerates memory deficits, AD-related pathology, and white matter
degeneration. Candidate: Dr. Hua is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Radiology of Boston University
(BU), Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine. She gained her PhD in Biophysics, and her previous training
was focused on cardiovascular MRI and arterial atherosclerosis. This K01 proposal will build on her previous
training in MRI, programming, and vascular biology, with 4 training goals to facilitate her transition into
neuroimaging and neurodegenerative diseases and towards career independence: 1) Learn the biology and
pathology underlying AD; 2) Learn relevant experimental skills in neurotrauma and AD mouse models; 3)
Advance her skills in neuroimaging; 4) Prepare for independent research and career track.
Mentors/Environment: Dr. Hua and her primary mentor, Lee E. Goldstein, MD, PhD, have assembled a strong
mentor/advisory team to guide her through the K01 training and research activity. The proposed plan will
leverage resources of the newly established Center for Translational Neuroimaging (BU) and the NIH-NIA
supported BU Alzheimer’s Disease Center. BU and the Department of Radiology are committed to supporting
junior faculty through internal funding, administrative assistance, and structured opportunities. Research:
Currently, it is unclear if blood-brain-barrier (BBB) dysfunction is a mechanistic driver for the acceleration of AD
after neurotrauma. I hypothesize that hippocampus is vulnerable to neurotrauma, and that resulting hippocampal
microvascular leakage will accelerate local accumulation of amyloid-β and phosphorylated-tau, as well as
accelerate white matter degeneration, ultimately leading to accelerated memory deficits in AD. The experiments
will be carried in a well-characterized transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) with and without well-calibrated
traumatic brain impacts. In vivo MRI measured hippocampal leakage will be correlated with memory deficits
measured by Barnes Maze test (Aim 1). Ex vivo LA-ICP-MS measured subregional BBB leakage in hippocampus
will be correlated with regional accumulations of amyloid and tau pathology (Aim 2). Finally, ex vivo diffusion
MRI will be used to assess how hippocampal injury accelerates white matter degeneration, especially in the
white matter bundles connecting to the hippocampus and playing an important role in memory and learning (Aim
3). Summary: This K01 proposal utilizes advanced imaging techniques to detect hippocampal BBB leakage,
and its relation to the acceleration of AD. It will facilitate Dr. Hua’s career transition to independence in the
research of neuroimaging and AD."

Wolbachia are a genus of endosymbiotic bacteria that comprise a promising, cost-effective tool to curb Zika and
dengue arboviral transmission based on two key facets. First, Wolbachia block pathogenic RNA viruses by
inhibiting their replication in arthropods. Second, Wolbachia selfishly alter sperm and egg via a process termed
cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) that can drive the bacteria into host populations. CI is expressed as embryonic
lethality in crosses between infected males and uninfected females, but this lethality is rescued in crosses
between infected males and infected females, which are the transmitting sex of Wolbachia. Consequently, CI is
deployed in field trials to either suppress mosquito population sizes or replace uninfected populations with
infected individuals resistant to arboviral infection. We recently exposed a genetic model of CI wherein
expression of two genes (cifA and cifB) causes embryonic lethality when expressed in testes, and expression of
one of the same genes (cifA) rescues lethality when expressed in ovaries. Prior to embryonic lethality, several
post-fertilization defects arise including delayed breakdown of the paternal nuclear envelope, mitotic arrest, and
chromatin bridging. As Wolbachia are stripped from sperm during spermatogenesis, the defects caused by cifA
and cifB may be due to uncharacterized pre-fertilization impairments to sperm integrity. Despite four decades of
intense research and current applications to vector control efforts, the details surrounding these pre-fertilization
impairments remain a central enigma. The overarching hypothesis of the proposed research is cifA and cifB
encode proteins that alter sperm integrity to cause CI. In Aim 1, we will use cytochemical, enzymatic, and
transgenic assays to determine the types, strength, and genetic bases of sperm modifications imposed by the
Cif proteins from wMel Wolbachia released in field trials by the World Mosquito Program. In Aim 2, we will
investigate localization patterns of the Cif proteins during spermatogenesis and storage. We will also identify
important interactions between the Cif proteins and either host or Wolbachia proteins. Knockout and transgenic
experiments will interrogate the necessity of the protein-protein interactions for expression of CI. Finally in Aim
3, we will evaluate if the natural CI proteins or protein complex can be experimentally isolated and successfully
injected into uninfected hosts to recapitulate CI and rescue. In these experiments, we will evaluate a novel
association between the Cif proteins and bacteriophage WO particles from Wolbachia. Studies have yet to yield
a mechanistic breakthrough for the natural CI defects afflicting gametes, and the rising interest in deploying
Wolbachia to curb arbovirus transmission necessitates an urgent understanding of the events underpinning the
CI drive system. If successful, this research will fundamentally advance studies of CI modifications and inform
Wolbachia's ongoing efficacy and delivery as a natural tool to control arthropods worldwide."

An optimal organ allocation policy for liver transplantation remains a critical yet unmet need. Fair and efficient
organ allocation are often incompatible goals. Although the transplant community has made incremental
changes to allocation policies over the years, disparities including, but not limited to, geographic region, age,
and disease type persist. This is problematic, as organs represent severely limited resources (e.g., In 2020,
median pretransplant mortality rate remained high [12.2 per 100 waiting list-years]) that are allocated in a life-
and-death context. One major challenge in this arena is that randomized controlled trials are virtually
impossible. Nevertheless, evidence-based policy making is necessary, making it difficult to accurately assess
the causal effects of policies. Thus, it is essential to estimate the causal effects of these policies using
observational data and rigorous methods that emulate the randomized trial. This Career Development Award
aims to prepare the applicant for a career as a health policy/services researcher focusing on causal inference
applied to chronic liver diseases / transplantation and whose work addresses a variety of health disparities.
This will be strengthened by the applicant’s solid clinical domain expertise in chronic liver disease and liver
transplantation. This goal will be accomplished within the infrastructure of the University of Iowa College of
Medicine and College of Public Health through (a) specific graduate coursework, (b) a Mentorship Advisory
Committee, (c) carefully selected conferences and workshops, and (d) a mentored research plan. The specific
aims of the proposed studies are to estimate (1) the causal effects of the fundamental liver allocation policies
(the Share-35 and the Acuity Circle policies), which designate different geographic boundaries and cutoffs for
the criterion (Model of End-stage Liver Disease score; MELD) that is used to determine medical priority for
allocation, (2) the causal effect of existing liver allocation priority rules in pediatric and adolescent candidates
and (3) the potential causal impact of formulating a policy proposing to match the age of donors and recipients
(donor-recipient age matching) and the cost-effectiveness of the potential policy implementation, all in the
United States (U.S.). These estimates will be computed rigorously using natural- and quasi-experiments with
an overlying causal inference framework, using a well-established nationwide observational transplant cohort.
At the end of this Career Development Award, the candidate will be well-prepared to become an independent
scientist with expertise in health policy, health services, epidemiology, and causal inference
frameworks/econometrics focused on various disparities in healthcare (i.e., race, gender, age, geography,
socioeconomic factors, and disease type), with specific expertise in chronic liver disease including liver
transplantation. Our study findings will inform revisions to the current liver allocation policy in the U.S. and
future studies designed to understand the causal effects of health policies guiding chronic liver disease/liver
transplantation, which will form the foundation of the candidate's first R01 submission."

Even though highly efficacious biomedical prevention and treatment interventions exist for a range of infectious
diseases, implementation has been marred by pervasive and unacceptable racialized disparities and led to
inequitable population health effects. While public health increasingly recognizes health equity as a priority, at
present we lack — and urgently need — a scientifically grounded, empirically supported, tool to assess the
equity capacity or equitability of public health programming and implementation. Such an instrument would
enable researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to advance equitable outcomes through anticipating gaps
before they occur, direct context-specific capacities, target improvements and resources and thereby
accelerate progress toward health equity. The Health Equitability Assessment and Readiness Tool (HEART)
will address this significant gap by completing the following specific aims 1) use a formal set of mixed method
activities to support the conceptual development and concept mapping of equitability into measurable domains,
2) develop the content, structure, and design of the HEART measure and conduct preliminary psychometric
analysis to assess validity and internal reliability, and 3) to implement and evaluate HEART in various HIV
program settings. The expected outcome is a scientifically validated and practical measure of public health
program’s equitability that can be easily integrated in community and clinical settings. The principal investigator
is well-positioned to lead the study activities with the support of her established team of collaborators with
complementary expertise in infectious disease prevention, health equity, implementation science, and

support “risky…innovative and high impact research concepts that will advance key concepts on broad,
important problems in biomedical research.”"

Medicare is the primary health insurance for older adults (65+) living in the U.S. Eligible beneficiaries must
choose between two different plan types: traditional Medicare (TM) and Medicare Advantage (MA). MA
enrollment has doubled in the last decade, currently covering about 45% of all Medicare beneficiaries. This
growth has been driven, in part, by an increasing proportion of Black and Hispanic MA enrollees. While
evidence suggests that some MA patient populations receive better-quality care and experience fewer
racial/ethnic health disparities, it is unknown whether this is true for socioeconomically disadvantaged Black
and Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries, who are at substantially greater risk of incident Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementia (ADRD). Because they have more complex healthcare needs but receive less coordinated
care and fewer preventive services, they are at significantly higher risk of potentially preventable
hospitalization, 30-day hospital readmission, and other adverse health events than their White counterparts.
Further, there is considerable variation in the quality of MA plans. Many MA plans in Black- and Hispanic-
populated counties have low quality ratings, which may contribute to racial/ethnic health disparities. Moreover,
beneficiaries’ health plan decision-making is complex, potentially exacerbating racial/ethnic health disparities
among ADRD beneficiaries. Finally, racial/ethnic health care disparity research has been mainly observational
and descriptive, thus limiting its usefulness in informing policy. The specific aims of this mixed methods study
are to use innovative econometric causal methods to (1) examine and explain racial/ethnic disparities in 16
measures of care continuity, receipt of preventive services, and quality of care in MA vs. TM; (2)
examine racial/ethnic disparities within and between MA plans in 16 measures of care continuity,
receipt of preventive services, and quality of care; and (3) explore health plan decision-making
challenges among beneficiaries with ADRD and/or their caregivers. Our multidisciplinary team, with
decades of experience in ADRD research, racial/ethnic healthcare disparity analysis, claims data and
econometrics, qualitative and mixed methods, and health policy is uniquely qualified to conduct this innovative
research. This study will inform Medicare policies to promote more equitable health care and facilitate easier
health plan decision-making for socioeconomically disadvantaged Black and Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries
with ADRD. With our national Policy Advisory Committee of stakeholders, including a beneficiary with ADRD
and/or a caregiver, we are well-positioned to disseminate findings and promote quality and equitable health
care for racial/ethnic minority Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD."

Mitochondria are essential organelles of endosymbiotic origin which have evolved to play critical roles in
eukaryotic physiology. Mitochondrial activity is dependent on proteins embedded in the outer mitochondrial
membrane (OMM), which mediate mitochondrial-cytoplasmic communication, and critical aspects of cellular
function such as apoptosis and the innate immune response. a-helical proteins are an important subset of
OMM proteins. However, how they get inserted into the lipid bilayer of the OMM in mammalian cells has until
recently been unclear.
 Work by myself, in collaboration with Rebecca Voorhees and Jonathan Weissman’s labs, has identified
the OMM resident protein MTCH2, a defining member of a novel family of insertases, as both necessary and
sufficient for the insertion of a-helical proteins into the OMM. MTCH2 is a diverged member of the solute
carrier family 25 (SLC25), and has evolved to exploit the canonical transporter fold for insertion. Bioinformatic
analysis reveals that MTCH2 has a homolog in peroxisomes, and orthologs across holozoa, suggesting a
common mechanism for a-helical protein insertion across membranes and eukaryotes.
 Building on this finding, this proposal aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of how a-helical
proteins are correctly targeted to the OMM and inserted into the lipid bilayer across eukaryotes. This work will
address a fundamental question in cell biology, as the OMM proteome has evolved to support increasingly
more complex functions in higher eukaryotes. a-helical proteins are defined by the presence of one or more
transmembrane domains (TAs), though their TMs can vary significantly in number and a range of biophysical
characteristics such as hydrophobicity. This proposal aims to first develop a deeper understanding of MTCH2
function. First, in vivo and biochemical techniques will be combined to map the route a substrate TM takes
through MTCH2 into the lipid bilayer, directly testing whether MTCH2’s conserved hydrophilic groove has a
direct role in this process. Second, this work will establish whether structural homologs of MTCH2 have
retained their insertase ability across eukaryotes.
 The biochemical skills and knowledge acquired by defining the molecular basis for MTCH2 will be
combined with systematic functional genomics to establish how a-helical proteins get targeted to the OMM,
and whether other factors besides MTCH2 are required to support the biogenesis of this diverse class.
Cumulatively, this proposal will provide important insights into the mechanisms that have evolved to support
eukaryotic life. Further, intimate knowledge of the machinery that governs a-helical OMM protein insertion will
be critical for developing new treatments associated with outer mitochondrial membrane protein dysregulation,
including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s."

 Experiences of loneliness are prevalent among older adults. Loneliness is a painful and pernicious
state occurring when there is a perceived discrepancy between one’s optimal levels of social interactions and
actual social relationships. Given that loneliness has been associated with negative health outcomes, detection
measures are imperative to identify both lonely and at-risk individuals early enough to intervene before adverse
health outcomes occur. However, the assessment of loneliness is challenging due to the stigma of being
labeled as lonely and the lack of integration of loneliness assessments into primary care or community-based
services. To tackle the problem, we will use smart speakers and passive sensing data to automatically assess
older adults’ level of loneliness as correlates of self-report scores on the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Our goal in
this project is to develop, deploy, and validate a smart speaker-based system for in-home loneliness
assessment that integrates Internet of Things (IoT) devices to gather both speech (acoustic and prosodic
features) and behavioral data (e.g., smart speaker use patterns, in-home mobility, sleep) from older adults. We
will enroll 70 individuals (age 65+) living alone in the community to collect digital biomarker data continuously
for 3 months. The specific aims are to: (1) Develop an innovative remote loneliness assessment system that
allows passive and unobtrusive capture of speech and behavioral data in the home setting; (2) Using a train-
test approach, develop and evaluate the performance of novel multi-class machine learning (ML) algorithms—
semi-supervised type of Generative Adversarial Networks (SGANs) — to estimate older adults’ loneliness
scores. The UCLA Loneliness Scale will be completed by participants every two weeks for 3 months to collect
ground truth data; and (3) Identify potential implementation barriers to the effective use of the system among
older adults (n=30). In particular, we will assess potential privacy and security concerns, social influence,
cultural values, and the level of personification of virtual agents that could influence the adoption and use of the
system. The novel ML models will allow us to identify not only “already” lonely individuals but also “at-risk”
individuals. The proposed research seeks to provide preliminary evidence that digital biomarkers from smart
speakers and IoT devices can be used for automatic loneliness assessment in the community. Results from
this study will support our long-term goal of implementing the system longitudinally as a platform for real-time
loneliness assessment and detection. This work will provide an opportunity to examine associations between
digital speech and behavioral data and self-report measures of loneliness to identify modifiable risk factors that
will inform the design of interventions to prevent adverse health impacts of loneliness and improve social well-
being among the older adult population."
10891666,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Epigenetic factors are genes that encode proteins that can affect spatial organization of DNA and the
accessibility of genetic regions to transcriptional machinery, thereby regulating cell-type specific transcription.
Pathogenic mutations in established epigenes are highly enriched in children with pediatric syndromic disorders,
often with symptoms that affect multiple organ systems, such as the brain, heart, gastrointestinal tract, bone, eye
and kidneys. The associated symptoms of intellectual disability, developmental delays, autism, diarrhea and
congenital heart defects vary in severity between individuals. The onset of these syndromes during early
childhood suggest that many of these epigenetic factors are critical to early developmental processes and cell-
fate transitions. Despite our improved diagnostic ability with exome sequencing, the mechanistic link between
epigenetic factor mutations and the direct mechanisms by which they disrupt mammalian developmental
processes remains unknown. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are genes that acetylate lysine (K) residues
and represent a common mechanism for controlling DNA accessibility to the transcriptional machinery. Here, we
study protein-truncating variants in two HATs: Lysine (K), Acetyl transferase 6A and 6B (KAT6A and KAT6B),
which cause Arboleda-Tham Syndrome (ARTHS) and Genitopatellar Syndrome (GPS) or Say-Barber-Biesecker-
Young Syndrome (SBBYS), respectively. Our goal is to develop and validate transgenic mouse models harboring
patient-specific mutations in these genes to establish the differential roles of these epigenetic factors on cell
specification during development driving the distinct syndromes."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle degenerative disease with cardiomyopathy in over 90%
of patients, and heart failure is a leading cause of mortality. DMD patients commonly harbor out-of-frame
mutations which result in complete loss of dystrophin protein. While CRISPR-gene editing has been employed
to delete the mutant exon for restoration of the dystrophin reading frame, this strategy raises potential safety
concerns as it relies on repair of the double strand DNA breaks created by CRISPR/Cas9, which may cause
unwanted large deletion, DNA rearrangement and viral vector integration. Developing novel approaches to
precisely and safely correct the disease-causing mutations in striated muscles is in urgent need to combat DMD.
Recent advances in base editors allow us to explore the feasibility of precise correction of genetic mutations in
animal models of DMD without creating double strand DNA breaks. Our recent studies demonstrate it is highly
efficient to correct a disease-causing point mutation in the striated muscles of a mouse model of DMD using
systemic delivery of adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9). This paves the way for clinical translation of in vivo base
editing for DMD. However, novel strategies are in urgent need to solve several safety-related issues (e.g. the
accumulation of off-target activities with persistent expression of base editing agents following AAV delivery;
high dose of AAV utilized; host immune responses). Here we propose to develop a novel controllable base
editing system (to reduce accumulation of off-target editing events and exposure of base editor to the host
immune system) delivered in recently engineered myotropic AAV capsids (to increase muscle transduction
efficiency with 10-fold less of AAV as compared to AAV9). The therapeutic efficacy and safety will be extensively
investigated using a newly established DMD rabbit model, which faithfully recapitulates the clinical signs of
muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy in human DMD. We will further engineer immune-friendly vectors and
develop a novel immune-modulating strategy to mitigate the host immune responses to the in vivo AAV-delivered
base editing therapy. Completion of the proposed studies will significantly advance our translational efforts to
develop safer precision medicine for DMD."

Dental caries remains an unresolved disease affecting more than 2.3 billion people worldwide. It disproportionally
afflicts impoverished families and medically compromised populations, including those with comorbidities such
as iron-deficiency anemia. Current approaches are insufficient for susceptible populations, where biofilms rapidly
accumulate under sugar-rich diets and poor oral hygiene leading to onset of dental caries that cannot be
effectively controlled, requiring new antibiofilm approaches. Fluoride, the anticaries mainstay, promotes
remineralization and reduces tooth enamel demineralization, but is ineffective against biofilms. Conversely,
current antimicrobials are restricted to broad-spectrum agents that can disrupt oral microbiota diversity while
lacking efficacy against dental caries. Thus, an alternative approach is needed to address the limitations of
current treatments and help control dental caries under pathogenic conditions. A major challenge is the rapid
establishment of intractable microbial biofilms in susceptible individuals. In cariogenic biofilms, bacterial cells are
enmeshed in an exopolysaccharides (EPS) matrix, forming highly organized and protected biostructures that
create localized acidic microenvironments. These low pH niches further induce cariogenic bacteria growth,
ensuring biofilm build-up and acid dissolution of tooth enamel. To overcome these challenges, new antibiofilm
strategies are needed to precisely target the biofilm properties and the acidogenic environment, and at the
same time, prevent enamel acid-demineralization. In the previous funding period, we studied the potential of
catalytic (peroxidase mimics) iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) for controlled, acidic pH-dependent activation of
hydrogen peroxide as a novel antibiofilm and anticaries treatment. We found that this approach potently
disrupted cariogenic biofilms and blocked apatite acid dissolution, significantly reducing dental caries in rodent
models. Furthermore, we discovered that coating IONP with dextran enhanced targeting specificity by improving
retention and incorporation into biofilm, while deterring binding to cellular and soft-tissue surfaces, providing a
selective biofilm-targeting approach. In vivo studies revealed that dextran coated IONP were highly effective
against caries development without affecting gingival/mucosal tissues and oral microbiome diversity, confirming
therapeutic precision. These findings were further confirmed using ferumoxytol, an FDA-approved IONP used
for iron deficiency therapy, that has similar size and dextran-coating to those made in-house. Recently, we
received an IND exemption for repurposing ferumoxytol for topical treatment in human in situ model studies. This
proposal is to further develop and understand catalytic nanoparticle technology for effective treatment of
cariogenic biofilms and prevention of dental caries using the ferumoxytol FDA approved IONP as a nanocarrier."

Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient with antioxidant function as it is required in the synthesis of 25
different selenoproteins, many of which are antioxidants such as glutathione peroxidases. Observing that
selenium’s antioxidant effects are too rapid and robust to be explained by selenoprotein production alone, we
uncovered a novel biological mechanism for selenium, in which it acts as an electron donor to reduce ubiquinone
to ubiquinol in a reaction that is catalyzed by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR). Ubiquinol is a key redox
component in mitochondria, as well as a cellular respiration intermediate, and this mechanism allows selenide
to rapidly suppress lipid peroxidation and trigger cellular respiration. Based on strong preliminary data, we will
examine the hypothesis that this mechanism allows selenium to act as a powerful antioxidant as well as an
alternative electron transport fuel. This mechanism is expected to account for some of the previously known
cytoprotective properties of selenium, explain why selenium deficiency is harmful, as well as introduce novel
selenium-based therapeutic approaches. In Aim 1, we will examine the role of SQOR-catalyzed ubiquinol
formation in the antioxidant role of selenium, as well as its previously unappreciated role as an electron transport
fuel. The beneficial effects of this mechanism on cell-based disease models for cardiomyocyte ischemia, electron
transport dysfunction, and ETC-impairing environmental toxins will be examined. In Aim 2, we will examine the
hypothesis that excess activation of this ubiquinol, membrane-polarizing mechanism is responsible for the
toxicity of high selenium levels. In Aim 3, we will explore the notion that the form of selenium as well as the
delivery route in vivo is key in whether this novel SQOR / ubiquinol mechanism is engaged. The proposal will
result in a mechanistically enhanced understanding of the biological roles of selenium and introduce strategies
to harness selenium biology for therapeutic effects."
10929546,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an incurable autoimmune disease and represents a substantial health problem in the population. Longitudinal studies of patients and murine models of SLE identify development of autoantibodies against new epitopes over time that correlate with increased pathology. The phenomena is referred to as epitope spreading, i.e. development of autoantibodies against determinants other than the initiating self-antigen. While the mechanism underlying epitope spreading remains unclear, we propose that spontaneous activation of a single B cell clone along with T cell help can promote activation and expansion of multiple distinct clones of nai""ve self-reactive B cells in both GC-dependent and -independent sites where they can be positively selected and undergo affinity maturation, compete and differentiate into effector cells leading to epitope spreading.
In order to characterize the dynamics of self-reactive B cells arising in GC-dependent and -independent sites in more depth, we developed a novel adoptive transfer model. In this mouse model, donor B cells from WT or genetic mutants are transferred into lupus mice bearing a single BCR specific for nuclear antigen. We found that the self-reactive WT B cells underwent clonal selection and affinity maturation resulting in single WT clones dominating the GC response much like that observed in our previously reported mixed BM chimeras using the same lupus strain. Remarkably, the donor B cells rapidly expanded over 7 divisions in a GC-independent response that was Tlr 7 and MHC II dependent resulting in selection of a novel subset of effector B cells with a DN2-like phenotype observed in lupus patients (CD11c+CD21 lo). Unexpectedly, donor B cells deficient in CD11c failed to compete with WT donor cells and develop into effector B cells. In the current proposal, we will characterize further the events initiating spontaneous escape of B and T cell tolerance in GC-dependent and -independent responses resulting in epitope spreading. Moreover, we will characterize single TCR that provide functional help in co-stimulation of self-reactive B cells and their antigen specificity. Finally, we will track migration of activated donor cells in the splenic white pulp that give rise to self-reactive effector B cells using a novel spacial transcriptomics approach referred to as MERFISH. Two broad aims are proposed:
Aim 1. Characterize the developmental kinetics and functional dynamics of self-reactive extra follicular ASCs.
Aim 2. Characterize the role of Tfh cells in epitope spreading of GC-dependent and -independent self-reactive B cells."
10916529,"Project Summary: Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death and has for a long time been appreciated to
be a hallmark of cancer cells. In recent years, drugs targeting the apoptotic pathway, such as the FDA-
approved BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax, have revolutionized therapy in cancers which have a particular
vulnerability to targeting this pathway. A different programmed cell death pathway, ferroptosis, has recently
been discovered. Understanding which cancers may be vulnerable to the induction of ferroptosis and which
targetable molecules are involved could lead to a new wave of successful cancer therapy. MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the deadliest subtypes of pediatric cancer. Here in, we demonstrate that
amplified MYCN drives an aberrant iron capture program in NB and increases intracellular cysteine
biosynthesis and selenocysteine dependence through multiple mechanisms to detoxify reactive oxygen
species (ROS) accumulation as a result of high cellular iron. The consequence of these MYCN-directed
changes is a synthetic lethality to genetic or pharmaceutical targeting of the glutathione/glutathione peroxidase
4 (GPX4) pathway resulting in ferroptotic cell death. This grant aims to expand our understanding of how
MYCN alters cysteine and selenocysteine production and ferroptotic inducing pathways to sustain an
antioxidant defense and how these pathways may be exploited pharmaceutically to improve therapeutic
responses in this recalcitrant tumor type.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Characterize the ability of MYCN to suppress ferroptosis in neuroblastoma
Aim 2: Identification of synthetic lethal ferroptosis resistance mechanisms in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma
Aim 3: In MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma mouse models, evaluate novel ferroptotic combination therapies
Study Design: Using well characterized isogenic cell lines and patient-derived xenograft cell cultures, we will
mobilize expertise in selenocysteine biosynthesis (Copeland), pantothenate kinase inhibitors (Rock), and
genomic screening of ferroptotic pathway modifiers (Olzmann) to better define the ferroptotic vulnerability in
MYCN-amplified NB and to uncover novel sensitizers to ferroptotic inducers in MYCN-amplified NB. The goal
of these experiments is to not only better understand how the MYCN oncogene hijacks cysteine for
selenocysteine production to mount a defense against an oxidized phenotype, but to create new therapeutics
to create better anti-ferroptotic approaches in MYCN-amplified NB. To this end, we will work with our preclinical
mouse model expert (Koblinski) and a NB clinical investigator (Glod) to build the preclinical evidence of
synthetic lethal new therapies into the clinic for refractory NB patients."

 Spinal cord injury (SCI) impairs sensory transmission and leads to chronic, debilitating neuropathic
pain. Chronic pain afflicts over 100 million Americans and creates an enormous burden on US health care
systems, costing over half a trillion dollars annually according to a recent report from the Institute of Medicine.
While our understanding of the molecular basis underlying the development of chronic pain has improved, the
available therapeutics provide limited relief. While our lab and others have shown that early post-SCI rehab
can prevent pain development, early rehab in human SCI may not be possible due to the multisystem,
polytraumatic injuries individuals with SCI sustain. Thus, there is a critical need for an adjuvant therapy to aid
those individuals who are unable to participate in early rehab. Neuropathic pain is increasingly recognized as a
neuroimmune disorder. While macrophages are regarded as key regulators of chronic pain development, it is
unclear whether they are acting in an inflammatory or reparative manner. This R01 seeks to better understand
how or if the activation state of macrophages influences nociceptive neuron excitability and pain development
after SCI. We will utilize an established spinal cord injury model of neuropathic pain development and drive
macrophage activation state by post-injury rehab, intrathecal administration of exosomes derived from Raw
264.7 macrophages stimulated in vitro or a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor by a polymer nanodelivery system
that specifically targets macrophages. This proposal seeks to understand the role of macrophages that infiltrate
the dorsal root ganglia and persist there chronically after SCI both in the development and maintenance of
chronic neuropathic pain."

Influenza viruses remain a global health burden due to yearly epidemics and their pandemic potential. Therefore,
understanding immunity to these viruses and further research on the development of improved vaccines is of
high importance. The influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins are the major targets of
protective antibodies. Long-term protection to influenza viruses remains a challenge due to high mutation rates
caused by a low-fidelity RNA polymerase as well as reassortment events of HA and NA with zoonotic influenza
viruses, and this necessitates annual vaccination for protection against circulating strains. However, vaccine
efficacy varies year to year due to mismatches between circulating strains and vaccine strains. This variability
highlights the importance of developing improved influenza vaccines. We and others have recently discovered
a class of antibodies targeting a conserved membrane-proximal epitope on the H1N1 influenza HA protein,
termed the anchor epitope. The overall goal of this proposal is to elicit a robust immune response of anchor-
specific and broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza virus. As a main tool to achieve this goal, we will be
scaffolding the anchor epitope to test the hypothesis that the scaffold will increase the prevalence of anchor-
specific antibodies alone or together with a soluble recombinant HA as part of a prime-boost regimen. In Aim 1,
we will utilize a computational strategy to scaffold the anchor epitope and rapidly screen constructs using
previously isolated anti-anchor antibodies. Scaffolds will be generated using a combination of Rosetta and
machine learning-based approaches to design and predict the stability and folding of the novel proteins. The top
candidate proteins will be recombinantly expressed and tested for antigenicity using a panel of anchor-targeting
antibodies as well as for thermal stability and monodispersion. In Aim 2, we will determine the efficacy of the
anchor scaffolds in the mouse vaccination and infection models for the elicitation of broadly neutralizing
antibodies. The top three candidates will be tested for immunogenicity and the ability to elicit anchor-like
antibodies in mice using several combinations alone and in a prime-boost regimen with influenza HA protein.
The top candidate will then be tested in a mouse challenge model with two different H1N1 pandemic viruses.
This R21 proposal is high risk as we will develop new scaffolding strategies and vaccine candidates, but it is
high reward as our approach has the potential to redirect strain-specific antibody responses toward a highly
conserved, and broadly protective epitope. Overall, our proposal will develop new approaches for scaffolding
broadly neutralizing protein epitopes, which could be applied to additional influenza and other viral glycoprotein
epitopes."
10889252,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Suicide rates are high in late adulthood, peaking in midlife among women and late life among men. Social
disconnection also peaks in late life and increases risks of suicide, persistent suicidality, and poor response to
psychosocial interventions. Our proposal responds to RFA-MH-22-135, outlining the critical need to identify the
mechanisms mediating the relationship between social disconnection and late-life suicidality and develop
efficacious interventions to target these mechanisms.
 The proposed study leverages methodological and conceptual innovations, developed by our team, to
investigate target engagement of the Positive Valence System (PVS) during a novel social reward psychotherapy
for mid- and late-life suicidality. We designed Engage & Connect, a remotely delivered psychotherapy that
targets social disconnection by increasing engagement in rewarding social activities. Engage & Connect aims to
alter disturbances of the PVS that may underlie late-life suicidality. In this study, 128 adults aged 50-80 with
major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation will be randomized to 9 weeks of Engage & Connect or Symptom
Review and Psychoeducation (SRP) active control condition. We will measure PVS functions on brain and
behavioral levels, through resting state functional connectivity of the PVS and behavioral changes in social
reward responsivity using our novel validated STAR task (Social Task for Assessment of Reward). We will
employ a cutting-edge “precision imaging” approach to estimate the functional brain map of each individual and
track the longitudinal effects of treatment on PVS circuitry. Our rigorous methodological approach will allow us
to test, at the individual level, the brain-based and behavioral mechanisms underlying response to psychotherapy
that targets social disconnection. Identification of individual patients’ biological and behavioral profiles, linked
with treatment response, can guide future psychotherapy personalization and increase its efficacy and reach to
vulnerable older adults at risk of suicide."
10852983,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Flea transmission of human diseases has occurred throughout the world, the most notable of which is the
bubonic plague or black death, caused by Yersinia pestis. Although not the pandemic it once was, plague
continues to cause annual human mortality across four continents, including North America, where it is endemic
in the rodent populations of the rural western United States. In this region, flea transmission of plague occurs
annually among the large prairie dog populations which are abundantly distributed throughout the grasslands.
Due to its role as an ecosystem engineer and trophic relationship with the endangered black-footed ferret, there
is ample surveillance data on prairie dogs documenting widespread mortality caused by epizootic outbreaks of
plague. These outbreaks occur regularly, though not necessarily annually in a given area, and can substantially
impact the local ecosystem. Some geographic areas experience enzootic plague, characterized by prolonged
periods with little to no plague activity in wildlife in between epizootic events. Although there is more than 100
years of research on flea transmission of plague, there remain significant gaps in understanding the enzootic
cycle, even though this cycle underlies the global persistence of plague and its continued threat to public health.
The research proposed in this application addresses key factors that influence the enzootic cycle. Specifically,
the research will focus on redefining the role of transovarial transmission of Y. pestis as a driver of the sylvatic
plague cycle. The proposed project is built on strong preliminary data documenting transovarial transmission of
Y. pestis from laboratory-reared and infected Xenopsylla cheopis. These data suggest that bacteria that are
transmitted via this mechanism survive through all developmental stages and even grow in these environments,
which may indicate that transovarial transmission could impact the persistence of plague in the absence of
widespread mammalian disease. The proposed work will follow-up on these observations with an innovative,
state-of-the-art approach that incorporates high resolution transmission electron microscopy to examine bacterial
interactions within the midgut epithelium in order to identify the mechanism that may be used for dissemination
from the digestive tract to the reproductive organs of the flea. Furthermore, imaging of Y. pestis in each
developmental stage will be facilitated by the use of the Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy
Volumescope (SBF-SEM) to reconstruct a high-resolution 3D image that illustrates the anatomical features that
support Y. pestis survival and growth in each life stage. The proposed work will rigorously address the potential
importance of this mechanism to the evolution and persistence of plague. Results of this high-risk, high-reward
R21 project will lay the groundwork for long term, inter-disciplinary mechanistic and ecological studies of
transovarial transmission of Y. pestis in fleas that will help inform our understanding of plague risk for humans
and animals."

The health, social and economic issues associated with dementia, and the inequitable burden of dementia across
different racial/ethnic populations, are of such magnitude and complexity that they require a vantage point from
multiple disciplines. Generating scientific evidence to advance dementia health equity requires rigorous methods
applied to the best available data. The University of Southern California’s Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s
disease Related Dementias Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (USC AD/ADRD RCMAR) brings a
distinct capacity for integrating theories and tools from myriad disciplines including but not limited to economics,
sociology, and gerontology, using large, complex data sets, and applying rigorous panel data and quasi-
experimental methods to generate innovative AD/ADRD disparities research. Our interdisciplinary faculty have
the support and expertise to advance research in our focus area: pathways by which social, behavioral and
economic factors, and policies and health systems affect disparities in risk of AD/ADRD, and affect disparities in
the health, health care and economic outcomes of persons living with dementia. We build upon our successful
10-year history of advancing the research and careers of underrepresented scholars. We bring together the
infrastructure, leadership, interdisciplinary expertise and resources to: (1) increase the number, diversity, and
scholarly achievements of scholars of dementia health equity research and; (2) develop new, innovative lines of
research to advance dementia health equity. The USC AD/ADRD RCMAR is housed in the Schaeffer Center for
Health Policy and Economics, which brings together expertise in AD/ADRD from across USC’s schools, and
maintains a large data core, analytical programming team, and external affairs team to support AD/ADRD
research and disseminate findings for impact. To this we add resources and leaders from our partner NIA funded
centers: USC’s Roybal Center for Behavioral Interventions of Aging, Alzheimer Disease Research Center,
Center for Economic and Sociodemographic Study of AD/ADRD, and USC/UCLA Center on Biodemography
and Population Health. Importantly we have partnered with two HBCUs, Spelman College and Howard
University, and California State University Fullerton - an Hispanic and Latinx serving institution. Their junior
researchers and senior scholars and leaders are uniquely positioned to bring diverse perspectives and broaden
the field of AD/ADRD research. We propose an Analysis Core (AnC) that leverages the deep expertise of
our Investigators and rich resources of programs at USC to provide data and programming support and
offer workshops in sophisticated analytical methods to scientists; to expand on existing and develop
new lines of research and methods to advance dementia health equity; and to promote research and
methods across RCMARs."

The Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR), a center comprised of the
three Research 1 universities in Michigan, proposes to expand its reach and impact by mentoring junior faculty
(most of whom are African American) and by focusing on the unique aspects of stress and coping in older
African Americans using a life course lens. Our four specific aims include (1) Increase reach through the
maturation of our three-university structure and our growing relationships with five HBCUs; (2) Recruit and
mentor 15 new junior researchers whose research will focus on health disparities and unique life course
experiences of stress and coping in African American older adults; (3) Enhance our established nationally
recognized model for successfully engaging with urban African American communities; and (4) Continue to
build the next generation of leaders for MCUAAAR. Three cores (LAC, AnC and CLRC) and the Research
Education Component (REC) are proposed in this application. We will employ an integrative approach to
mentoring, entailing a structured set of activities and training across the pilot funding period:(a) Formal goals
will be set at the beginning of the pilot and reviewed in monthly MCUAAAR meetings; (b) Based on the goals
set, a mentoring team will be assembled to assist with research, dissemination of findings, and research
translation;(c) A set of training activities in scientific writing, measurement, and community-based research
partnerships will be conducted each year; (d) A formal six and twelve-month evaluation will be conducted and
shared with the MCUAAAR faculty. We continue to be motivated by the dearth of NIH studies in health
disparities and by the continued low representation of African Americans funded through R01 grants. The
RCMAR program has been important in helping to eliminate this gap for RCMAR researchers overall."
10904749,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to examine the effects of the generosity of Medicaid dental benefits for pregnant and
postpartum women on access to preventive, routine and emergent dental care. Our central hypothesis is that
low-income women in states that provide comprehensive dental benefits will have a higher likelihood of
preventive and routine dental care in their pregnancy, and less likely to have emergency department visits for
dental problems. In addition, low-income women in states that provide dental benefits in the year after birth will
have greater utilization of preventive and routine dental care. To evaluate our hypothesis, we will examine the
relationships between state-level generosity of Medicaid dental benefits for pregnant women and access and
utilization of dental care during pregnancy and postpartum. We will use Pregnancy Risk Assessment and
Monitoring Survey (PRAMS) data on dental care use and unmet dental needs from 2012-2019; and recently
released nationally representative T-MSIS Analytic Files (TAF) from 2016-2019 that captures detailed types of
dental utilization among more than 5 million pregnant women in the US. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Examine
the impact of pregnancy-related Medicaid dental benefits generosity on access to preventive dental care and
unmet dental need during pregnancy using a causal difference-in-differences approach; Aim 2. Measure the
association between pregnancy-related Medicaid dental benefits generosity and routine and emergent dental
care use during pregnancy; Aim 3. Assess the relationships between postpartum Medicaid dental benefit
generosity and routine and emergent dental care use in the year after birth. We will use a combination of
descriptive and quasi-experimental approaches reinforced with several robustness checks. These rigorous and
comprehensive approaches will enable us to make strong, generalizable conclusions about use of dental care
during pregnancy and postpartum and the impacts of generosity and duration of Medicaid dental benefits. Our
study will be the first to examine ED visits for dental problems in pregnancy and the patterns of postpartum
dental care use. The knowledge generated through this research will inform decision-making and
implementation of postpartum extensions of pregnancy-related Medicaid eligibility under the American Rescue
Plan and provide preliminary data for a subsequent R01 that examines the effects of these extensions on
maternal oral health."
10878899,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive, debilitating respiratory condition with a clinical
course that is punctuated by acute exacerbations (AECOPD) ranging from self-limited episodes to florid
respiratory failure. AECOPD are most often precipitated by viral and/or bacterial infections. The bacterial
organisms that commonly play pathogenic role in AECOPD are Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, and
Enterobacter, and multidrug resistant Pseudomonas and Klebsiella pneumoniae are a common cause of
secondary pneumonias in hospitalized patients with COPD. The change in color of sputum indicative of
purulence that is often used as a surrogate marker for the presence of bacterial infection is a late, inconsistent,
nonspecific and insensitive biomarker; it cannot distinguish between viral and bacterial infection, and many
patients with AECOPD do not produce sputum at all. The availability of a targeted, pathogen-specific and
sensitive imaging modality that could detect bacteria in the lower airways and differentiation bacterial from viral
infection non-invasively would advance our understanding of AECOPD and facilitate development of preemptive
treatment paradigms. In this proposal, we intend on using these unique bacterial membrane transporters on
bacteria, and their distinct metallophores as PET reporter probes to localize and identify pathogenic live bacteria
in AECOPD. We will also evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the robes in identifying the bacteria in co-
infection models with influenza virus (H3N2). We will further evaluate the responsiveness of the PET imaging
probe and modality to different antibiotics, against several clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa.
If successful, the probes would be able to assist with identifying subclinical bacterial colonization of in patients
with AECOPD, to determine if the bacteria that are ultimately responsible for the infection are the same strains
that was found to be colonizing. This project will lay the foundation for a new technology platform that will open
avenues to explore the possibility of using the diverse array of metallophores as contrast agents for imaging the
entire repertoire of pathogenic infections."
10886802,"Schizophrenia is a chronic, disabling, and strongly heritable illness. Existing treatments do not restore function
for many patients, nor do they modify the disease process, and development of novel therapeutics is hindered
by a lack of biological targets. Postmortem studies demonstrate reduced cortical dendritic spine density among
individuals with schizophrenia, consistent with clinical structural neuroimaging studies. Convergent lines of
evidence from rodent models and human genomics suggest that these abnormalities may arise from
microgliamediated pruning dysfunction.
 The investigators have developed, validated and published patient-specific models of microglia-mediated
pruning by generating reprogrammed microglia-like cells from patients and healthy controls, and assaying them
with isolated and highly purified synapses (synaptosomes) from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived
neuronal cultures. In their published studies, they have demonstrated robust evidence of dysfunction in synaptic
engulfment attributable to abnormalities in both microglia and neurons from individuals with schizophrenia. To
date, efforts to link these abnormalities to disease risk loci have largely been limited to the complement C4 locus,
and focused almost entirely on neurons. The proposed investigation will draw on the patient-derived cellular
biobank created by the investigators to apply genetic engineering methods to address the role of microglia in
synaptic pruning directly. Specifically, it will investigate the contributions on synaptic engulfment of both
microglial expressed schizophrenia liability genes and putative upstream regulators of neuronal complement
synaptic expression through engineered induced microglia and neuronal cultures, respectively.
 For Aim 1, the investigators propose to perform CRISPR screening applied to induced microglia-like cells,
applying high scale in vitro synaptic pruning assays to discover novel disease-associated gene functions
implicated in schizophrenia. In Aim 2, the investigators will further validate loci from the screen in Aim 1 in
CRISPR-engineered iPSC-derived microglia models to confirm roles in synaptic engulfment and determine other
effects on microglia development and function. To complement these aims, in Aim 3, the investigators will
generate engineered iPSC-derived neuronal cultures manipulating the expression of human complement C4
alleles and modulatory genes. They will then use synaptosomes from these lines for functional in-vitro
microglialmediated engulfment assays to assess effects of manipulation of these genes in neurons.
 Taken together, these aims will characterize the effects of schizophrenia liability loci on human synaptic
pruning, in terms of microglia function as well as neuronal complement expression, using validated, scalable
patient-derived model systems. They will prioritize targets for treatment development and inform the biology of
schizophrenia risk."
10898917,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Cumulative evidence from large-clinical and neuroimaging studies suggests that the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia involves an increased vulnerability to premature aging. However, this knowledge has not been
translated into clinical practice due to the lack of understanding of the biological underpinnings of premature
aging in schizophrenia. Additionally, there remains a current lack of diagnostic tools for detecting and monitoring
individuals who experience premature aging in a clinical setting. This lack establishes the critical need to develop
in vivo biomarkers of premature aging in schizophrenia to provide a novel avenue toward diagnosis and
neuroprotective treatment. The current proposal provides a step to tackling this challenge through a large,
multimodal study of schizophrenia. The central hypotheses state that individuals with schizophrenia are more
vulnerable to premature aging, as indicated by an increased expression of senescence-associated secretory
phenotype (SASP) proteins, and that the increased expression of SASP proteins explains abnormalities in
physical health, cognition, and brain structure in schizophrenia.
 The applicant, Dr. Johanna Seitz-Holland, has access to several cross-sectional datasets, including clinical,
cognitive, blood, structural, and diffusion data, spanning the schizophrenia lifespan. In the K99 phase, she will
utilize data from 80 individuals with early schizophrenia and 80 matched healthy individuals to establish the
increased expression of SASP proteins as a biomarker for increased vulnerability to premature aging in early
course schizophrenia. In the R00 phase, Dr. Seitz-Holland will include data from over 700 individuals (18-85
years) and characterize the role of the increased expression of SASP proteins as a mediator between
schizophrenia, physical health, cognition, and structural brain abnormalities across the lifespan. Successful
completion of these aims will yield several impactful outcomes. The findings will inform the development of a
clinically feasible, minimally invasive, and low-risk biomarker for premature aging. In addition, the findings will
allow the development of a parsimonious hypothesis that accounts for aspects of brain and physical health
deficits. Lastly, they will provide a scientific basis for developing novel neuroprotective treatments.
 Dr. Seitz-Holland’s long-term goal is to conduct translational research to increase the life quality of those with
psychotic disorders. This application builds on her postdoctoral training in multimodal trajectory schizophrenia
studies and complements it with training from world-class experts in the use and analysis of blood biomarker
data and geriatric science. This award will thus provide her with a unique opportunity to develop into an
independent researcher who can effectively conduct multimodal psychiatric studies and translate findings into
the evidence-based diagnosis and treatment strategies needed in clinical science."
10916449,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Cannabis initiation during adolescence confers four-fold greater risk for cannabis use disorder (CUD) than
initiation in adulthood and is associated with increased risk for negative psychiatric outcomes. No effective
pharmacologic treatment exists for adolescent cannabis use or CUD, and most adolescents do not achieve
sustained abstinence with psychosocial interventions. Functional MRI (fMRI) holds promise for identifying new
intervention targets and/or clarifying mechanisms of existing treatments but has yet to lead to clinical translation.
New, large-scale neuroimaging data and complementary patient intervention designs with precision
neuroimaging can begin to address remaining questions on the cause vs. effect between neural markers and
cannabis use, the extent to which putative neural markers of cannabis use instead reflect psychiatric, familial,
and/or social determinants of substance use disorders (SUDs), and whether neural markers normalize with
abstinence. Through this 4-year K23 award, I will build upon my existing skillset in developmental neuroscience
and big data neuroimaging with new training in addiction phenotyping in population studies (e.g., Adolescent
Brain Cognitive Development [ABCD] study) and mentored implementation of complementary precision
neuroimaging approaches within patient intervention designs for adolescents with CUD. The proposed research
aims will (1) utilize existing ABCD Study data to validate known and identify new functional MRI markers of
cannabis use initiation and (2) leverage a precision neuroimaging study within a CUD patient intervention design
to test the modifiability of functional MRI markers of cannabis use during the transition from regular use to
abstinence. Matched neuroimaging protocols, out-of-sample validation, design approaches to increase reliability,
and high frequency scanning in the precision neuroimaging study (3 scans over 6 weeks in adolescents with
CUD randomized to cannabis abstinence (n=24) or cannabis monitoring (n=20), and matched controls (n=20))
provide key innovations towards rigor and reproducibility. With these methods, we will test the overarching
hypothesis that hyperfunction of fronto-striatal reward circuitry is both a trait-level risk-factor and modifiable
consequence of adolescent cannabis use. Recognizing the need for both neural and phenotypic specificity, we
will compare hypothesis-driven, fronto-striatal circuit markers to data-driven, whole-brain effects and also
examine the potential moderating role of psychiatric, environmental, and social determinants of SUD. Through
these scientific aims, associated training goals, and guidance from an exceptional multidisciplinary mentorship
team, I will gain the necessary skills to address the current methodological issues facing my field and contribute
to improved translational research on the neurodevelopment of SUDs. Complementary skillsets in large-scale
neuroimaging and clinically relevant, patient-oriented designs, together with my clinical training, will uniquely
prepare me for an independent program of research and associated independent funding.

This proposal encompasses a 5-year research and training plan to support the transition of Dr. Wattenberg to
an independent research career. Dr. Wattenberg’s long-term goals are to lead an independent R01-funded
research program at an academic institution, conducting research focused on defining relevant cancer
immunobiology. To achieve this, Dr. Wattenberg’s short-term goals are to gain expertise in the areas of mouse
modeling, transcriptomics and clinical trials. These efforts will be supported by the K08 award and through
mentorship provided by Dr. Gregory Beatty and a mentorship committee consisting of successful senior
scientists. Additional formal training will be provided through a didactic curriculum, including workshops and
courses. Research will be conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, which provides comprehensive
institutional resources and a robust research environment for the training of physician-scientists. The proposal
focuses on defining how immune memory in cancer is initiated and disrupted. Studies will be performed using
clinically relevant mouse models of cancer and patient samples. Immune memory is crucial for durable tumor
control induced by immunotherapy. However, durable tumor responses are rare in patients. Better understanding
of how immune memory develops is needed to inform novel immunotherapy strategies. Preliminary data show
that activation of conventional dendritic cell (cDCs) subtypes triggers immunological memory in mouse models
of pancreatic cancer. Further, immunological memory in this model is dependent on CD4+ T cells and not CD8+
T cells - the prototypical effector cells of the immune system. Additional prior work shows that systemically
elevated inflammatory proteins associate with poor clinical outcomes to cDC targeted immunotherapy (CD40
agonist) in patients with pancreatic cancer. Moreover, complementary studies in mouse models show the
inflammatory cytokine IL-6 to associate with cDC dysregulation. These findings suggest that inflammatory
proteins drive cDC dysfunction, limiting productive immunosurveillance. It is the central hypothesis of this
proposal that distinct cDC subtypes coordinate CD4+ T cell memory, which is necessary for durable tumor
immunosurveillance, and that cancer-associated inflammatory proteins drive T cell immune evasion by
dysregulating cDC subtypes. Dr. Wattenberg will investigate this hypothesis in the following 3 aims. Aim 1.
Determine the impact of cDC subtypes on tumor specific CD4+ T cell memory. Aim 2. Determine the role of CD4+
T cells in coordinating anti-tumor immunological memory. Aim 3. Define the mechanisms by which cancer-
associated inflammatory proteins drive cDC fate. Successful completion of this proposal will provide fundamental
insights into cancer immunobiology and identify novel immunotherapy strategies to improve outcomes for
patients with cancer. Further, the mentorship and training provided by this proposal will support Dr. Wattenberg’s
transition to independence leading a translational research group."
10874557,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Viral spillover from animal reservoirs into humans can decimate public health systems and cripple the
world economy, as evident with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Continued wildlife habitat destruction,
human expansion, and routine global travel keep increasing the likelihood that another viral pandemic will
occur again within the next few decades. Beta coronaviruses are an incredibly diverse family of viruses
observed across Asia, Europe, and Africa, that have proven capable of zoonotic spillover into humans as they
have caused multiple worldwide outbreaks over the last two decades. We still lack the fundamental
understanding of the molecular and genetic factors that dictate the molecular compatibilities that determine
which beta coronaviruses are most likely to jump into humans in the future.
 The ability of SARS-like beta coronaviruses to utilize ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry is a major factor
determining the extent of coronavirus tropism across species or within the tissues of an organism. While
SARS-CoV-2 has been heavily studied, almost nothing is known about most other members of this virus
family. Traditional studies can only test a handful of conditions at a time, incompletely sampling the vast range
of relevant experimental conditions, particularly for the hundreds of uncharacterized beta coronaviruses. Large-
scale, minimally-biased, cell-based entry assays are needed to model how these factors converge to dictate
the probability of infection.
 We will pair new methods in cell engineering and synthetic biology with DNA-sequencing enabled
multiplex genetic assays to perform a series of large-scale infection assays revealing the factors determining
susceptibility to beta coronavirus entry. These large-scale experiments will reveal how ACE2 sequence and
cell surface density impact the efficiency of virus entry. By testing a library of receptor binding domain
sequences identified from ecological surveillance of bat coronaviruses, we will identify which viruses possess
sufficient affinity to human ACE2 to potentiate cross-species transmission, and create a catalog describing all
of the different ways these viruses have evolved their sequences to engage ACE2. By modeling the
relationship between spike and ACE2 protein sequence, expression level, and efficiency of cell entry, we will
identify potential animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like bat coronaviruses, and predict which
viruses have sufficient binding with human ACE2 to potentially spark the next pandemic."

 Smell is a fundamental human sense. Even though humans do not rely on smell for survival, olfaction is
necessary for physical and behavioral health. Detection and identification of volatile chemicals by the olfactory
system is built upon the “one receptor per neuron” rule, whereby each mature olfactory sensory neuron
expresses a single olfactory receptor (OR) gene from one allele. Singular expression is critical for olfactory
perception, since it defines both the receptive field of the OSN and the circuitry of its axon.
 OR gene choice and singular expression is contingent on orchestrated changes in nuclear architecture.
Using live-cell imaging, I will elucidate how this changing nuclear architecture leads to changes in gene
expression. In Aim 1, I will image the endogenous transcription factors (Lhx2/Ebf/Ldb1) and the actively
expressed OR DNA to determine how these transcription factors promote the expression of a single OR allele.
My preliminary results suggest that these transcription factors come together to form an activating hub, and that
this hub represents a greater enrichment of transcription factors than can be explained simply by the
stoichiometry of enhancer binding sites. I will image the relationship between the actively expressed OR and
heterochromatin markers to determine if association with the activating hub isolates this allele from
heterochromatin. In Aim 2, I will investigate the nature of the biomolecular interactions that allow this activating
hub to recruit Lhx2/Ebf/Ldb1 beyond the stoichiometry of binding sites through single-particle tracking of
transcription factor mutants. I will determine if the amplification in recruitment is due to phase separation of the
intrinsically-disordered domains of Lhx2/Ebf/Ldb1 or if it is due to cooperative protein-protein interactions. Finally,
in Aim 3, the independent phase of this proposal, I will integrate the imaging of these transcription factors with
imaging of the genome to extend my research towards a complete characterization of the nucleoprotein
dynamics regulating OR gene expression. Specifically, I will begin by characterizing the interactions of OR
enhancers and OR mRNA with Lhx2/Ebf/Ldb1 and the actively expressed OR using live-cell imaging.
 I am determined to lead an independent research laboratory at an academic institution, working at the
interface of OR gene regulation and optical microscopy. I am optimally positioned to achieve this goal, working
as I am with Dr. Stavros Lomvardas at Columbia University. Dr. Lomvardas is an expert in olfaction and genome
organization, and during the K99, I will receive technical training from him in advanced sequencing technologies.
I have also assembled an advisory team consisting of Drs. Elizabeth Hillman, Richard Axel, Carol A. Mason, and
Anum Glasgow. This advisory team will guide me in professional training and transitioning to independence. In
addition to elucidating general principles of how nuclear organization can dictate transcriptional specificity, the
experiments in this proposal will enable a mechanistic interrogation of the molecular interactions that regulate
singular OR transcription."
10929518,"Cystolic DNA (cyDNA), which is acquired in somatic cells, is emerging as an instigator/integrator of cellular
functions associated with aging, yet the causes/consequences of cyDNA are poorly understood. Do individuals
have a genetic predisposition to develop cyDNA or is its frequency most heavily influenced by environmental
factors? Is cyDNA an early trigger for the acquisition of other age-related biomarker hallmarks, or does it arise
in response to perturbations involving a subset of these hallmarks? To answer these primary questions, we will
complete a longitudinal study (10 to 15 years timeframe) of 100 twin pairs [70 identical (MZ) and 30 fraternal
(DZ) twin pairs; 200 individuals] who are discordant (35 MZ; 15 DZ) or concordant (35 MZ; 15 DZ) for cyDNA
frequencies. The twin pairs will vary in age (currently 22 to at least 80 y.o) to allow us to chronicle associations
between aging hallmarks and the acquisition of cyDNA. For each time point we will determine: (a) cyDNA
levels, (b) chromosome specific-telomere/subtelomere lengths, (c) senescence markers, and (d) DNA
methylation patterns in cells from two different tissues (blood and buccal mucosa cells [to assess potential
soma-related differences]). Two measures of cyDNA will be quantified: (1) micronuclei (MN) frequency; and (2)
extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) frequency. The MN frequencies will be identified for each of the 24
human chromosomes using a novel assay we developed that combines spectral karyotyping and fluorescence
in situ hybridization technologies. The genetic contents of the eccDNA will be determined using our rolling
circle amplification and sequencing protocol. Chromosome-specific telomere and subtelomere lengths will be
determined using our Q-FISH method and our newly developed nanomapping method that exploits atomic
force microscopy, CRISPR-Cas9, and our novel genome sequence algorithm to provide unprecedented
resolution of telomere/subtelomere measures. We will also use “state of the art” tools we developed/optimized,
to quantify telomere dysfunction; senescence (SADS, classical, and transcriptome studies), and genome-wide
DNA methylation patterns. Using a method of robust variance component estimation (implemented in the
FISHER quantitative genetics package), this study will provide the first measure of the extent to which
individual differences in cyDNA and subtelomere lengths (which are associated with TERRA) are determined
by additive genetic, common environmental, and specific environmental effects. We will also use “state of the
art” statistical modeling and bioinformatic tools that we developed/optimized to analyze biomarker patterns
within individuals, between co-twins, and among twin pairs to determine the stability of patterns with aging, and
to identify temporal, as well as driver/mediator, relationships among cyDNA and other aging hallmarks
(telomeres/subtelomeres, DNA methylation, senescence). The information gained from this study could also
lead to the development of a health screening test(s) and/or identify new therapeutic targets that could
transform our approach for developing treatments to alleviate symptoms of age-related health conditions."
10894144,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pediatric feeding disorders are extremely common, affecting 5-20% of children, and they cause
significant patient morbidity, decreased quality of life for children and parents, and increased healthcare
utilization and cost. Many of these patients require feeding tube placement, but even this does not ensure
successful feeding and growth. Up to 50% of children with gastrostomy tubes suffer from feeding intolerance,
defined as vomiting or inability to tolerate adequate feed volumes to sustain growth. Despite the high
prevalence and large health impact of this problem, no prospective studies exist to help inform management.
Furthermore, the gastrointestinal mechanisms underlying feeding intolerance remain largely unknown,
hindering our ability to effectively target treatments toward patient pathophysiology.
 Two proposed mechanisms of feeding intolerance are (1) delayed gastric emptying and (2) impaired
gastric accommodation. We have shown that 49% of children with feeding intolerance have delayed gastric
emptying; however, no studies have correlated delayed gastric emptying with feeding intolerance symptoms or
assessed the role of other abnormalities of gastric physiology such as impaired accommodation. In Aim 1 of
this proposal, we will use a cross-sectional study design to fully characterize (using both ultrasonography and
scintigraphy) gastric emptying and accommodation patterns in gastrostomy-fed patients with and without
feeding intolerance. In Aim 2, we will use a prospective cohort design to assess changes in gastric physiology
and feeding intolerance symptoms after initiating therapy with erythromycin (which improves gastric emptying)
or cyproheptadine (which improves gastric accommodation).

Cells are the basic unit of life. Cells are very dynamic: they change over time and locations, respond to different
environments, and interact with other cells. Over the past decade, single-cell biology has witnessed enormous
growth owing to massive technical advances, such as single-cell sequencing, multi-omics, and spatial omics.
However, obtaining dynamic dimensions of live cells along with their multi-omic information at the single-cell
resolution is currently difficult and certainly not possible on large scales. Here, we propose a novel cell barcoding
technology that has the potential to enable us to collect live information of cells and connect the data to their
detailed omics information. This technology makes use of laser particles (LPs) with unique optical barcodes
for >100,000 channels, each containing a unique DNA barcode. The “dual-barcoding” will allow us to optically
track live cells under a microscope while they are in their natural environment or in culture, acquire their live
information, harvest the cells, acquire the omics information of the same cells by droplet-based next-generation
single-cell sequencing, and then combine the live imaging and omics data at the single cell resolution.
Furthermore, our technique can be upgraded to multi-omics modalities, combining multiple layers of information
from the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome, together with morphological, locational, functional,
and behavioral data. We will apply the method to study sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis of cancer cells in
vivo. The acquired in vivo single-cell imaging and multi-omics data will provide an unprecedented picture of the
cancer cell lymphatic metastasis process. This project has two specific aims. Aim 1 will develop an optical-and-
DNA “dual” barcoding strategy for droplet-based single-cell sequencing. Aim 2 will apply the method to study
breast cancer SLN metastasis in vivo. During the K99 period, the applicant will receive additional training to
expand her experience and shape her independence in the following areas: (1) LPs and optical barcoding, (2)
LP imaging and in vivo mouse imaging, and (3) single-cell sequencing and multi-omics. This proposal is under
the combined mentorship of Dr. Andy Yun (LP technology, optics, and imaging) and Dr. Ralph Weissleder
(cancer biology, in vivo imaging, and system biology), and a team of experts as advisors for single-cell
sequencing and bioinformatics. The interdisciplinary research environment at Massachusetts General Hospital
and Harvard Medical School will significantly facilitate the proposed study. If successful, the proposed study will
offer a new paradigm for “dynamic” single-cell analysis, with unprecedented speed and throughput, enabling
multi-omics modalities for the profiling of proteins, RNAs, and DNAs at the single-cell level, together with cells’
dynamic phenotype information, enable spatial-omics profiling at the 3D resolution without the need for cell
segmentation. This will be a significant step beyond the current single-cell omics strategies that collect only
snapshot data, in vitro or ex-vivo. This new method will transform the way we use imaging and single-cell analysis
and will open enormous applications for scientific discovery, diagnosis, and treatment in healthcare."
10906950,"Project Summary/ Abstract
The long-term goal of the proposed research is to uncover molecular mechanisms driving non-
apoptotic cell death in vertebrate development and disease, specifically the role of nuclear and
chromatin organization in this process. Programed cell death functions to sculpt organs, remodel tissues,
regulate cell number, and remove defective cells. While apoptosis is the most studied type of cell death, it
does not account for all cellular destruction during development. Studies in C. elegans have uncovered a
novel developmental cell death program, referred to as linker cell-type death (LCD), which is morphologically
and molecularly distinct from apoptosis. Cell death with LCD features is commonly observed during vertebrate
development and in neurodegenerative polyglutamine diseases, aggressive cancers, aging, progeria and
laminopathies. During my postdoctoral training, I uncovered striking nuclear and chromatin changes that
occur during LCD. This K99/R00 proposal seeks to identify the molecular regulatory processes
underlying these nuclear and chromatin changes during LCD in C. elegans, and to test the functional
conservation of LCD in a vertebrate context through the following specific aims: 1) Elucidate the role
of nuclear lamin and its regulation in the process of LCD (K99); 2) Establish a mouse model system to study
LCD in a developmental mammalian setting using degenerating Mullerian duct as a model (K99/R00); 3)
Identify molecular processes that govern chromatin dynamics during LCD in C. elegans and mammals (R00).
This proposal builds on my doctoral studies in mammalian epigenetics and chromatin, as well as postdoctoral
training investigating non-apoptotic cell death in C. elegans. During the mentored phase, I will gain essential
training in mouse organ culture and management, which will set me up to establish a robust and
innovative independent research program studying the contribution of chromatin and nucleus to the
non-apoptotic cell death in vertebrate and invertebrate systems, in addition to human disease. The
outstanding environment at the Rockefeller University, with mentorship from Dr. Shaham and my Advisory
Committee, will provide crucial expertise to facilitate my transition to independence. The studies proposed
here will lead to the development of new markers to distinguish among different types of cell death in
vertebrate development and disease, while uncovering the molecular underpinnings of LCD. Because LCD
is a prevalent type of cell demise, this proposal may not only shed light on basic aspects of development,
neurodegeneration, and cancer, but could also eventually uncover in-roads of clinical significance."
10910127,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiac IKr is a critical repolarizing potassium current shaping the human ventricular action potential. It is
conducted by heteromeric assemblies of the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG1) 1a and 1b subunits.
These subunits are encoded by alternate transcripts of the hERG/KCNH2 gene and differ only in their amino-
terminal regions. hERG1a/1b heteromerization is vital for normal CM function, as the imbalance of subunit
expression and/or function results in cellular pro-arrhythmic behaviors. hERG1a/1b assembly is mediated by
the co-translational association of the encoding mRNAs in HEK293 cells, cardiomyocytes derived from human
induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs), and human myocardium. Evidence suggests that interaction
between the nascent proteins is not required for the co-translational complex assembly. This grant's
preliminary findings indicate that this complex assembly occurs post-transcriptionally and is promoted by direct
interactions between hERG1a and 1b mRNAs governed by their secondary structures. In preliminary studies,
RNA binding proteins DDX3X and DDX5 were identified as part of the complex, and purified DDX3X promoted
hERG1a/1b mRNAs' association in vitro. In the K99 phase, I will define the mRNA structural features
promoting the co-translational association and determine the affinity and energies of the RNA/RNA interaction
using in vitro systems, isothermal calorimetry (ITC), mutagenesis, hybrid protein-RNA immunoprecipitation
(RIP), and live-cell imaging. I will also determine whether DDX3X and DDX5 affect hERG1a and 1b mRNAs
stability, translation, and association in hiPSC-CMs using qPCR, electrophysiology, Western Blot, ribosome
profiling, RIP, and single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH). I will use quantitative ITC and in
vitro reconstitution approaches to determine the specificity, affinity, and energies of the interaction between
purified DDX3X and DDX5 with hERG1a and 1b mRNAs. I will also evaluate if DDX3X and DDX5 promote the
association of the mRNAs in in vitro systems. In the R00 phase, I will determine whether the stability,
translation, and association of hERG1a and 1b mRNAs are impaired in arrhythmias associated with type 2 long
QT syndrome (LQT2). I will use hiPSC-CM disease models to evaluate half-life, translation rate, and
association of the mRNAs with qPCR, ribosome profiling, RIP, and smFISH. These experiments will contribute
to understanding ion channel biogenesis and elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying LQT2 related
arrhythmias. This proposal is designed to fulfill my short-term goals of expanding my skills in cardiovascular
research and biophysics and transitioning into the independent phase of my career. This will ultimately allow
me to obtain my long-term purpose of linking RNA and ion channel biophysics to translational cardiovascular
research."

Accumulating research suggests that barriers to eliminating the persistent racial disparities in cardiovascular
disease (CVD) are related to structural-level social determinants of health (SDOH). The majority of this
evidence is cross-sectional, from studies using administrative datasets (i.e., US Census) to quantify structural
SDOH and structural racism associations with ecological-level measures of CVD. Prospective and clinical CVD
outcome data are needed to advance from descriptive-level evidence; however, well-established cohort studies
typically lack access to novel structural determinants. The scientific objective of the research plan is an
innovative solution to generate the needed high-quality dataset, by employing data fusion techniques to link
structural determinants from administrative datasets with prospective cohort data. I will generate four
structural-level determinants at the neighborhood-level using geographic linkages between the Women’s
Health Initiative (WHI) cohort with 1) US Census 2) American Community Survey (ACS) 3) Center for Disease
Control and 4) Neighborhood Redlining Maps. Each structural determinant includes a measure of racialization
and adheres to recent conceptual frameworks for advancing the quantification of structural racism in CVD
research. I uniquely measure determinants longitudinally to account for changes in residence and the duration
of exposure. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will quantify structural racism at the intersection of race and income using
the index of concentration at the extremes (ICE). The causal effects of ICE on CVD incidence over 30 years of
follow-up will be estimated. This mentored research and training prepare me for the R00 phase research. In
Aim 2, I propose to link the Social Vulnerability Index to evaluate a hypothesized structural intervention on
CVD. In Aim 3, I propose to estimate CVD risk associated with racial residential segregation and residence in a
historically redlined neighborhood. Evaluating causal mechanisms, temporality, life-course exposure, and
accounting for race and gender intersectionality would markedly advance the current level of evidence. The
public health implications of which may help design future interventions to target modifiable structural policies
and practices. The career development plan will advance my scientific training in data fusion techniques, the
modeling of structural racism, and pathways to CVD. Through mentored training combined with this research
plan, the MOSAIC K99/R00 will prepare me to transition to an independent investigator in a tenure-track faculty
position. This award would advance three Objectives of the NHLBI Strategic Vision through the use of (3) an
emerging opportunity in data science to accelerate understanding of (7) factors that account for differences in
health among populations, led by (8) a scientist who would diversify the scientific workforce."
10849825,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adenovirus (Ad) normally induces mild, self-limited infections in immunocompetent human hosts. A more virulent
strain of Ad14, Ad14p1, first emerged in the U.S. military and has since spread globally to civilian populations
resulting in severe infections, sometimes leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The incidence
of ARDS in the U.S. is ~200,000 cases annually, with a hospital mortality rate of ~40%. Most ARDS treatment
measures target the inflammatory response; however, all have failed to show a mortality benefit. We have shown
that the Ad E1B 20K (20K) gene product controls modulation of the macrophage inflammatory response to cells
dying from Ad infection (Ad CPE corpses). Absent or low level 20K gene expression generates Ad CPE cells
that are pro-inflammatory, whereas normal (wild type virus) 20K gene expression generates anti-inflammatory
Ad CPE cells. Ad14p1 expresses only 20% of the 20K expressed by wild type Ad14. This reduced 20K
expression induces pro-inflammatory Ad14p1 CPE corpses, whereas wild type Ad14 CPE corpses are anti-
inflammatory. The central hypothesis of this application is that this viral genetic change in the immunomodulatory
effect of infection with emergent Ad14p1 is the key biological difference through which this emergent virus
increases the incidence and severity of acute lung injury (ALI) that can result in ARDS and death. The Syrian
hamster, Mesocricetus auratus, is permissive for infection with human adenoviruses. Syrian hamsters are also
susceptible to many other human viruses such as influenza, hantavirus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, Marburg and
Ebola. We have shown that infection of hamsters with Ad14p1 replicates many of the key features of human
ALI/ARDS including patchy bronchopneumonia, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, edema and
neutrophil infiltration into the lung and airways. A problem with the Syrian hamster model system has been that
there are no transgenic hamsters and that there is a lack of immunological reagents available, such as those for
the mouse and human. Development of the CRISPR/Cas9 Syrian hamster has removed one of those obstacles.
This project addresses the other problem by creating antibodies that are specific for hamster cell surface markers
expressed on macrophages. These antibodies will allow identification and isolation of macrophage sub-
populations and comparative characterization of macrophage activation in response to Ad14 and Ad14p1
infections. The antibodies will complement the small number of existing hamster-specific antibodies available for
flow cytometry studies. These antibodies will allow us to begin to understand the effects of Ad14 and Ad14p1
infection on the innate immune response and to develop mechanistic studies of how these two viruses generate
such different immune responses. Understanding those key factors will allow development of targeted
therapeutics to treat not only Ad-induced ALI/ARDS but potentially ARDS triggered by other causes of ALI. In
addition, these antibodies can be used to study the effects of other human pathogens on macrophages and
neutrophils in the Syrian hamster."
10927374,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Approximately 60% of older adults with Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia (ADRD) have three or more
chronic conditions. Multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) and frailty are also risk factors for ADRD and can affect
the expression of AD pathology with regards to cognitive function, disease stage, and neuropathological
burden. Utilizing biomarkers to diagnosis ADRD may provide a more accurate and cost-effective assessment
of the underlying etiology contributing to the cognitive impairment and may guide treatments and counseling
about individualized care pathways. However, widespread incorporation of these biomarkers into routine
clinical care and population screening programs for older adults with multiple MCCs and cognitive impairment
has not occurred. Blood-based biomarkers are now clinically available to aid in the diagnosis of ADRD and are
more feasible, especially for older adults with MCCs, and less costly and invasive than CSF or PET-based
biomarkers. However, no research has examined these blood biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of
ADRD in primary care, especially among diverse populations. It is unknown how and when these blood
biomarkers should be used, particularly for diagnosis and prognosis among older adults with MCCs and/or
limited life expectancy. Moreover, the effect of MCCs on levels of the biomarkers are not well understood.
Numerous other questions remain, such as: 1) whether the ADRD biomarkers enhance prognosis among older
adults with MCCs and cognitive impairment; 2) for whom it is most beneficial to obtain ADRD biomarkers
including blood, CSF or imaging; 3) how the biomarkers can be implemented in a primary clinical healthcare
delivery model; 4) whether there are subgroup differences (e.g. race/ethnicity, sex, MCCs) that affect the
interpretation of the biomarkers; 5) assessment of cost estimates and risk/benefit ratios for reimbursement; 6)
how best to communicate the results to patients and their caregivers; and 7) the ethical aspects of biomarker
collection and potential for incidental findings due to mixed pathologies, especially among older adults. The
overall goal of this application is to establish a national consortium, the Alzheimer’s Diagnosis in older Adults
with Chronic Conditions (ADACC) Network, consisting of multi-disciplinary investigators that will address these
and other questions, and develop evidence-backed strategies and guidelines for the use and implementation of
biomarkers for ADRD diagnosis in older patients with MCCs and cognitive impairment. The consortium will
have an Executive Committee, Steering Committee, and Data Coordinating Center. It will fund three pilot
projects each year and convene an annual meeting. Working groups will be developed to focus on the
questions listed above and others. Successful completion of the grant aims will advance the diagnosis and
care of older adults with MCCs and cognitive impairment by increasing understanding of how and when to
implement ADRD biomarkers."
10898729,"Summary
Although the importance of a diverse biomedical science workforce is widely appreciated, progress toward
broadening participation in STEM fields has been disappointingly slow. Contact with inspiring STEM educators
can increase the number of underrepresented students who pursue biomedical research careers, but too few
scientists are trained as teachers, and even fewer are attuned to the needs of diverse student populations. The
University of Pennsylvania's Postdoctoral Opportunities in Research and Teaching IRACDA Program
(PennPORT IRACDA) has been working to address this problem by training postdocs for careers that combine
high quality research and teaching, while supporting STEM education at regional minority-serving institutions.
The dual objectives of the program are: 1) to develop a diverse group of highly trained biomedical and
behavioral scientists who are both outstanding researchers and highly qualified undergraduate educators, and
2) to strengthen undergraduate science education at our partner schools and encourage undergraduate
students to pursue further education leading to a career in the sciences. During the three-year training program
(with an optional fourth, research intensive year), 15 total scholars (5 IRACDA-funded scholars per year) will
conduct cutting-edge, independent research under the direction of Penn faculty research mentors, who
represent a broad array of NIGMS-related research areas and departments at Penn and its affiliated institutes.
With support and training from PennPORT IRACDA and Penn’s Biomedical Postdoctoral Programs, scholars
will conduct impactful research and develop the professional skills needed to succeed in academic research. In
parallel with their research training, PennPORT scholars will progress through a teacher training sequence in
which they take a formal course in pedagogical methods offered by the Penn Center for Teaching and
Learning and audit a course at one of our partnering minority-serving institutions, teach for two semesters with
mentorship from partner school teaching faculty, and conduct individualized leadership activities to gain
exposure to academic programming. Our three partnering institutions, Delaware County Community College,
Lincoln University, and Rutgers - Camden University, span the range of undergraduate environments,
providing scholars with distinct teaching opportunities. For the partner schools, PennPORT IRACDA scholars
provide new pedagogical approaches and exciting, research-oriented courses. In addition, PennPORT
scholars serve as important mentors and role models to partner school undergraduates, supporting their career
progression and providing opportunities to engage in research in Penn labs. We anticipate a successful
program outcome in which at least 70% of scholars will attain their career goal of obtaining an independent
academic position that combines teaching and research. Success will also be defined by positive partner
school impacts, including the delivery of high-quality courses and increased engagement of partner school
students in research-oriented activities that can lead to careers in biomedical research."
10912057,"Analysis Core (AnC) Abstract
The overarching goals of the Analysis Core (AnC) are to support innovative research into social and behavioral
processes underlying health inequities, and to train junior investigators on the tools and approaches that will
enhance the rigor of their research to generate meaningful insights regarding the health and well-being of older
African Americans. The objectives of the AnC are twofold. The first objective is to provide MCUAAAR
Scientists, HBCU affiliates, and Center faculty with the methodological and analytical tools necessary to
conduct and complete pilot projects and RCMAR-related research in a manner that is both transparent and
rigorous. This objective involves providing training, consultation, and logistical support in (a) state-of-the-art
approaches to study design, data collection, and data analysis, and (b) NIH best-practices in rigor and
reproducibility, including study pre-registration, coding and documentation, and data sharing. The second
objective is to embed collaborative, interdisciplinary team science into research practice through a thematic,
case-based training framework informed by the biopsychosocial model. Collectively, these objectives seek to
generate novel scientific insights and methodological approaches to reduce inequities in health and promote
well-being of African Americans over the life course. The AnC has expertise and experience supporting a wide
range of projects (i.e., primary data collection, secondary data analysis, mixed-methods designs, advanced
statistical techniques, and machine learning tools) and provides a forum for Scientists to gain meaningful
exposure to methods from a wide range of disciplinary orientations. The AnC objectives leverage long-
standing, mutually-beneficial relationships with the other MCUAAAR Cores, networks of NIA, NIH and
University centers, organizational partners, and initiatives at UM, WSU, and MSU that have a shared
commitment to applied social and behavioral science and to mentoring junior investigators. We fully expect,
based on our prior interactions, that the analytic methods and training tools developed by the AnC will be
shared within the MCUAAAR, with the RCMAR Coordinating Center and NIA and NIH collaborating centers,
organizational partners, HBCU affiliates, and the broader scientific community."
10912058,"RESEARCH COR (REC) ABSTRACT
There is a severe shortage of ethnic minorities at all levels of the bio-medical and social and behavioral
sciences workforce. African Americans, Latinos and Native Americans have a lower likelihood of entering and
completing college, graduate school, and professional schools. Additionally, ethnic minority faculty members in
the social and bio-medical sciences are less likely to receive tenure or move to the highest levels of academic
positions. Mentoring is one of the major issues identified in the literature that may substantially facilitate
diversifying the academic and biomedical workforce. We propose to build upon a proven method of
“integrative” mentoring which has allowed pilot investigators in the MCUAAAR to become productive
researchers and obtain NIA/NIH funding. The three specific aims of the Research Education Component
(REC) include: 1) Recruit and select 15 new junior researchers who propose pilot studies using a
biopsychosocial life-course framework for behavioral and social science studies of aging and health disparities;
2) Coordinate the short- and long-term mentoring, retention, and follow-up of this set of ethnic minority junior
investigators whose research focuses on the social and behavioral aspects of physical and mental health and
health disparities; and, 3) Conduct year-round training sessions and implement curricula for pilot scientists;
conduct intensive three-day summer workshops for pilot investigators and a national audience of minority
doctoral students, junior faculty, and postdoctoral fellows; and conduct auxiliary mentoring groups for doctoral
students in our three partner universities and HBCU partners. We have developed a structured mentoring and
education process, which includes an individualized development plan, monthly integrative and individual
mentoring sessions, and an educational series in research fundamentals and health disparities. Our mentoring
approach is enhanced through the integration of the Research Education Core with the Administrative,
Community Liaison and Outreach, and Analysis Cores. The MCUAAAR faculty have developed a proven
strategy to successfully mentor junior researchers, and the MCUAAR faculty are active major researchers in
the field of African American life-course development and aging. Based upon this proven track record, the
Michigan Center for Research on Urban African American Aging Research is clearly well-suited to contribute to
the development of the next generation of RCMAR scientists."
10912059,"COMMUNITY LIAISON AND RECRUITMENT CORE (CLRC) ABSTRACT
African American older adults continue to lag dramatically behind Non-Hispanic Whites in terms of both health
outcomes and participation in health research. The most common barriers to research recruitment are fear and
mistrust. The Healthier Black Elders Center (HBEC) Participant Registry of the MCUAAAR employs best
practices in the science of recruitment, retention, and continuing program evaluation. We propose three major
ways to extend the MCUAAAR’s work in recruitment and retention of older African Americans in research and
in the science of recruitment and retention: (1) Enhance the Flint registry through the maturation of the CLRC
in Flint. We began building a Community Advisory Board in 2018, and a registry is now underway; (2) Publicize
the participant registries to faculty at Michigan, Wayne State and Michigan State doing research in health
among older African Americans, and (3) Conduct research on long-term registry members to better understand
retention. Our three specific aims are to (1) Expand our long-established participant registry and older African
American involvement in research; (2) Contribute to the science of recruitment and retention of older African
Americans by examining the characteristics of our program and the registry participants who remain in the
registry long-term and (3) Enhance our established nationally recognized model for successfully engaging
African American communities. The CLRC is clearly present in all of the MCUAAAR cores and REC. The
Institute of Gerontology at Wayne State University, directed by MPI Peter Lichtenberg, houses the HBEC. The
Analysis Core is involved in each of the recruitment and retention projects led by the CLRC. Finally, the REC
integrates the CLRC into community-based research projects with older African Americans. The LAC, REC
and CLRC will work together to plan the summer workshops focused on best practices for community based
research on African American older adults."
10909361,"Massachusetts Center for Alzheimer and dEmeNtia behaVIoral reSearch In minOrity agiNg (Mass-ENVISION) is a
proposed new Alzheimer's-related Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (AD/ADRD RCMAR) that will address
the critical need for mentored research training for underrepresented in medicine (UiM) scientists in the development,
testing, and implementation of behavioral interventions across hospital and community settings, for racial and ethnic
minority older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) and their informal care partners. There is a
dearth of evidence-based behavioral interventions to support minority older persons with ADRD, their informal care
partners, and dyads, as well as a critical gap in the number of UiM scientists poised to mitigate this shortage. To address
these research and resource gaps, Mass-ENVISION will identify UiM scientists who are committed to ADRD behavioral
health and interventions research and will support training and development of independent UiM scientists poised to
eliminate health disparities and inequities in ADRD behavioral health. Further, Mass-ENVISION would become the only
RCMAR to serve the entire New England region, which is in critical need of this resource. Mass-ENVISION, a collaboration
of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston University (BU) and Cambridge Health Alliance and their medical
school affiliations (Harvard Medical School, BU School of Medicine), university-affiliated hospitals, other Boston and MA-
area research centers, satellite hospitals and community clinics, will provide RCMAR Scientists with interdisciplinary,
comprehensive training and sustained and tailored mentoring in ADRD behavioral health and interventions research using
the revised NIH Stage Model, the Science of Behavior Change, prevention approaches under the Centers for Disease Control
disease stage-based (i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary) and the National Academy of Medicine target-based (indicated,
selective, universal) frameworks, and the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework. Mass-ENVISION will collaborate
closely with other NIA-funded Centers and their investigators, including the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Center (MADRC), Boston University ADRC (BU-ADRC) and Boston Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence
Center, to translate biological and epidemiological advances as mechanistic targets for ADRD behavioral interventions.
Mass-ENVISION will be led by a UiM PI, Dr. Okereke (Director, MGH Geriatric Psychiatry and MGH Psychiatry Center
for Racial Equity and Justice), with strong collaborative track records with team members and Core Leads/Co-Leads, who
are also from diverse and UiM backgrounds (e.g., Black, Asian, Latino, first generation at college) and have complementary
expertise in ADRD, health disparities and health equity research, social and behavioral health, behavioral interventions,
implementation science, and interdisciplinary science. Mass-ENVISION will have 4 Cores: Leadership and Administrative,
Research Education Component, Data and Analysis, and Community Liaison and Recruitment. Cores will be composed of
investigators who are diverse with respect to backgrounds, institutional affiliations in MA and Greater Boston, disciplines,
and research and training skills, to facilitate Mass-ENVISION’s success in developing an inclusive research mentoring
environment and a diverse biomedical research workforce to advance health equity in ADRD behavioral health."
10909362,"The goal of the Leadership and Administrative Core (LAC) is to provide the overall infrastructure and scientific and
intellectual leadership of the translational, interdisciplinary, collaborative, and investigator development functions that are
expected of an AD/ADRD RCMAR. The Scientific Theme of Mass-ENVISION (Massachusetts Center for Alzheimer and
dEmeNtia behaVIoral reSearch In minOrity agiNg) is the training and sustained and tailored mentoring of underrepresented
in medicine (UiM) scientists in developing, testing and implementing of scientifically rigorous behavioral health
interventions for persons with ADRD (Alzheimer disease and related dementias) and their informal care partners in hospital
and community settings. The rationale for selecting this scientific theme is the critical need for new ADRD behavioral
interventions as well as the need to diversify biomedical research, consistent with the call for ADRD behavioral research
under RFA-AG-23-025. All RCMAR Scientists will receive training in ADRD behavioral health and interventions research
anchored to the newly revised (2022) NIH Stage Model, the Science of Behavior Change, the NIA Health Disparities
Framework and the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and NAM (National Academy of Medicine) prevention models. The
LAC will conduct its work through 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1. Establish the leadership, infrastructure and community to
support the Mass-ENVISION Scientific Theme. The LAC will: Provide administrative leadership, oversight and facilitation
of scientific interactions and collaborations across all Cores and component institutions, as well as with other regional NIA
Centers, including 2 Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs); Ensure that principles and practices of diversity,
equity, inclusion, accessibility and anti-racism are integrated throughout all Cores and RCMAR Scientists’ training
experiences; Promote a community-centered focus to the work conducted by all Cores. Aim 2. Support rigorous training
and career development for RCMAR Scientists in the Mass-ENVISION Scientific Theme. The LAC will: Coordinate with
the Research Education Component and Data and Analysis Core teams to support training of RCMAR Scientists in
knowledge and methodologically rigorous application of novel ADRD behavioral health and interventions. Aim 3. Evaluate
success of the RCMAR and of RCMAR Scientists. The LAC will: Create systems, resources and processes for monitoring
of mentoring success and progress of RCMAR Scientists and pilot studies; Monitor, record and report performance metrics
of this RCMAR and support dissemination of successful systems, resources and processes to other RCMARs, ADRCs and
the scientific community. The LAC team will consist of PI Dr. Okereke, Associate Director Dr. Budson, a Program Manager,
and LAC members Drs. Blacker, Gomez-Isla, Hyman and Keuroghlian; it includes senior leadership members of both the
Massachusetts ADRC and Boston University ADRC. The LAC features high levels of leadership, administrative experience,
and complementary skills to oversee and facilitate effective and impactful interactions and collaborations across all Cores,
partnering institutions, stakeholders, and programs, to support the achievement of all Aims of Mass-ENVISION."
10909364,"The goal of the Data and Analysis Core (AnC) of the proposed Alzheimer's-related Resource Center for Minority Aging
Research (AD-RCMAR), Mass-ENVISION, is to support RCMAR Scientists through consultation, guidance, and hands-
on support for the implementation of best data practices. In conducting the proposed Alzheimer disease and related
dementias (ADRD) research projects, RCMAR Scientists will need to rely on standard data collection and analysis tools as
well as develop new tools and innovate in the leveraging of novel, often technology-driven, tools. The AnC will provide
guidance on implementing best practices, and navigating the substantial expertise and resources available to RCMAR
Scientists through Mass-ENVISION affiliations with Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital,
Harvard Medical School, Boston University (BU) and BU School of Medicine, Cambridge Health Alliance, the
Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC), BU-ADRC, Boston Claude O. Pepper Older Americans
Independence Center (OAIC), Hebrew SeniorLife, and more. The AnC will be led by Drs. Bettina Hoeppner and Benjamin
Cook, and will be supported by access to experienced statisticians, qualitative data experts and system engineers. Our team
builds on four key strengths: (1) deep mentoring experience across a diversity of research settings and topics, where our
AnC members have served as mentors on numerous NIH-funded career development awards (e.g., F32s, K01s, K23s, K12s);
(2) a focus on diverse and underrepresented in medicine (UiM) populations, for whom our AnC Co-Leads run behavioral
and social science research projects focusing on UiM, marginalized or stigmatized populations; (3) demonstrated investment
in pooling science-advancing resources and making them broadly available (e.g., PI of NIDA-funded R24 on advancing the
science on recovery community centers; PI of P50 ALACRITY Center); and (4) a shared dedication to dismantling structural
racism through mentorship of promising scientists from diverse backgrounds (e.g., UiM undergraduate student training
program, R13s). The specific aims of the AnC are to: 1) Provide (statistical, data analysis) mentoring to RCMAR Scientists;
2) Support unique and emerging measurement needs for RCMAR Scientists; 3) Provide guidance on mHealth data to
RCMAR Scientists; and 4) Curate existing and emerging data sources across Mass-ENVISION and AD-RCMARs. In
summary, the proposed Mass-ENVISION Data and Analysis Core will support RCMAR Scientists through consultation,
guidance, and hands-on support at key points during the progress of their projects. The AnC will guide RCMAR Scientists
in best data practices that will enable the rapid translation of their research findings into publications, promote their long-
term research career success, and facilitate the harmonization of data sources across RCMAR studies."
10912033,"Mosquito-borne alphaviruses such as chikungunya, Mayaro, and Eastern equine encephalitis viruses cause high
morbidity and mortality in their mammalian hosts. Alphaviruses are globally distributed arthropod-borne viruses
that are enzootic in nature with the potential to disseminate to new geographical regions due to vector
adaptations causing new outbreaks. A 2019 outbreak of 38 human cases of Eastern equine encephalitis virus
occurred in the United States, raising concerns about its reemergence. In 2005–2006, a chikungunya outbreak
started in the Indian Ocean Island of Réunion had spread around the world, infecting millions of people.
Chikungunya fever is characterized by debilitating joint pain that can last up to 2–3 years, causing arthritis-like
conditions. No effective antiviral strategies or vaccines are available against any of these pathogens. Studying
these viruses to gain a molecular understanding of their lifecycle is essential to discovering novel targets for
therapeutic intervention. Specifically, the poorly understood intracellular mechanisms that drive alphavirus
assembly and budding represent promising antiviral targets. We reported for the first time that the alphavirus-
encoded ion channel protein 6K plays an essential part in virus budding by enabling the formation of cytopathic
vacuoles-II and envelope spike protein transport to the plasma membrane. The defects due to the deletion of 6K
can be restored to varying levels by the expression of a functional HIV-1 Vpu and influenza A virus M2 ion
channel. We also demonstrated that ion channel inhibitors could be utilized as antivirals. Building on these
observations, in Aim 1, we will characterize chikungunya and Sindbis virus 6K ion channels and their activity by
reverse genetics, transport assays in proteoliposomes and fractionated intracellular membrane vesicles, and
live-confocal imaging of virus-infected cells with ion-specific fluorescent probes. In Aim 2, by expressing virus-
encoded ion channels, including the SARS-CoV-2 E protein in cells and from an alphavirus, we will determine if
ion channel-based Golgi remodeling is a standard mechanism used by enveloped RNA viruses for membrane
modification and efficient virus budding. With new reverse genetics tools and CRISPR-Cas9 methods, we will
investigate the functional involvement of host-encoded ion channels in alphavirus budding. By completing these
aims, we will define a novel mechanism by which ion channel proteins modify the secretory pathway for virus
budding and how this process can be exploited as an antiviral target. We will also generate new reverse genetics
tools that will be useful to the scientific community. The critical knowledge gaps we will address are 1) what are
the ions transported by alphavirus 6K? 2) how does 6K participate in virus budding? and 3) an understanding of
a general mechanism involving virus and host ion channels utilized by alphaviruses for efficient budding."
10911361,"Summary
The fragmented clinical data in EHRs and trials makes it hard to study the relationship between Alzheimer's
disease (AD) and multiple chronic diseases (MCC). This is because the data is often spread out across different
platforms and databases, making it difficult to get a complete picture. In addition, the data is often incomplete.
This can lead to gaps in research and missed opportunities to understand MCC’s contribution to AD progression.
To overcome these challenges, we will develop interoperable electronic health records (EHR) with an application
programming interface (API) that follows the standard data format, i.e., Fast Healthcare Interoperability
Resources (FHIR). Partnering with ACTIVE MIND, an interventional trial that examines the potential efficacy of
cognitive training (CT) in reducing dementia incidences, we will link, consent, extract and harmonize local EHRs
and other relevant health information from ~1,000 patients. We will develop ontology models and use them to
guide the natural language processing (NLP) models to distill, organize, and convert MCC and relevant concepts
into FHIR-accessible data. Using these data together with FHIR-mapped structured data, we propose a
demonstration project to develop novel missing data imputation and computational phenotyping models to stratify
heterogeneous subpopulations based on longitudinal MCC patterns to predict their AD onset risks."
10877035,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The latent period after a severe brain insult such as traumatic brain injury or status epilepticus, and before the
onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures, is characterized by changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.
Profound morphological changes, including hilar ectopic granule cells and abnormal dendritic development
(e.g., hilar basal dendrites) is observed, therefore raising the question whether seizure- induced neurogenesis
is epileptogenic. Our past work of ablating adult neurogenesis before or after acute seizures has shown a pro-
epileptic role of new neurons, however existing ablation strategies in animal models have all suffered from an
inability to decipher the mechanisms that promote aberrant adult-born granule cells (abGCs) because the cells
are removed from the circuit. In this revised R01 application, we will capitalize on recently published work from
our laboratory demonstrating that activity in immature abGCs regulates Ca2+ and gene expression which is
necessary and sufficient for the production of aberrant abGCs and disruption of the hippocampal circuitry
leading to epilepsy. We propose work to determine the mechanisms that promote aberrant neurogenesis,
focusing on the genes and signaling pathways that drive aberrant abGCs as well as identifying the neuronal
inputs to the aberrant abGCs. Because our past work has always been in the pilocarpine model of mesial
temporal lobe epilepsy, we will expand these studies to address the role of aberrant abGCs in a non-status
model, such as epilepsy that occurs after controlled cortical impact injury. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate that
hM4Di-regulated gene expression in abGCs offers a new way to manipulate potential aberrant gene regulatory
pathways and define the functional role of our top 2 candidate genes – Timp3 and Rrm2 - identified in RNA-
sequencing analysis. In Aim 2, we will complement the work in Aim 1 using hM4Di in the pilocarpine model and
identify the hM3Dq activated genes and neuronal inputs associated with aberrant abGCs in wild-type mice. In
Aim 3, we will ablate or silence abGCs after controlled cortical impact injury and evaluate the impact on the
development of chronic seizures. Together these studies are expected to provide a greater understanding of
the mechanisms that promote aberrant abGC maturation, which may offer new strategies to specifically target
abnormal new neurons while sparing healthy neurons. These studies would be broadly impactful in a variety of
neurological disorders including epilepsy."
10881925,"ABSTRACT
To enable efficient specialization and dynamic regulation of subcellular regions, many cells have evolved local
translation of mRNA - yet the fundamental principles of such translation regulation in astrocytes are unknown.
Long studied in neurons, local translation of a variety of proteins is thought to be essential for the synapse-
specific changes that underlay learning and memory. In the prior cycle of this award we provided evidence
astrocytes also have a regulated local translation by using a variety of approaches. Here, we propose to continue
this work, focusing on the following question regarding this fascinating new basic biological phenomenon: what
is the regulatory grammar that determines when and which transcripts are locally translated in astrocytes?
Our central model is that elements in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of transcripts are responsible for their
enrichment or depletion from ribosomes in peripheral astrocyte processes (PAPs), via UTR interactions with
RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). However, with hundreds of potential elements to
screen, new, scalable methods are needed to systematically characterize how RNA localization and translation
is regulated in astrocytes, both at baseline and in response to signaling cues. Furthermore, glial morphology only
reaches full maturity in vivo, requiring in vivo functional studies. Therefore, we have developed a new method, a
synaptoneurosome–massively parallel reporter assay (SN-MPRA) which allows us to assess functional effects
of thousands of candidate UTR elements in vivo simultaneously. We will apply this to define the sequences that
modulate RNA localization in astrocytes. Furthermore, to better understand how a subset of these elements
function, we will define the role of a specific RBP, ‘quaking’ (QKI), in modulating local translation in astrocytes.
Finally, to understand how sets of transcripts might be regulated in a coordinated fashion for local translation,
we will examine the role of miRNA effector proteins (Ago2) along with specific miRNAs in regulating local
translation in astrocytes."
10848371,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune responses are a fundamental pathophysiological process that significantly contribute to ischemic
brain injury. Holding the immune response in check can alleviate the delayed injury seen in stroke and
has considerable translational value. CD200 binds to its receptor, CD200R, that is expressed on immune
cells. This forms an endogenous inhibitory signal and reduces the activation of immune cells. The
traditional notion that the neuronal-microglial CD200-CD200R interaction is the key to suppressing
deleterious immune activation has been increasingly questioned, as accumulating data has shown that
the CD200R is expressed on peripheral immune cells but not on adult microglia. In this proposal we
hypothesize that the CD200-CD200R signaling axis inhibits mobilization of peripheral immune cells after
stroke, and that interruption of CD200-CD200R interaction will exacerbate both central (brain) and
peripheral immune responses. We will specifically examine the CD200-CD200R axis from both ends, by
manipulating either CD200 or the CD200R to determine the effects on peripheral immune cell activation
and stroke injury. In Aim 1, we will use a bone marrow chimera mouse model generated from global
CD200R knockout and GFP+ mice, to determine the contribution of peripheral vs. central (brain) CD200-
CD200R signaling to stroke outcomes. Aim 2 will investigate the effect of endothelial CD200 signaling on
peripheral leukocyte migration in the ischemic brain. Brain endothelial CD200 knockdown (by AAV-BR1-Cre
virus) and lenti-CD200 virus (conjugated with endothelial specific promotor Cadherin 5) transfected mice will
be used to examine the effects of down-/up-regulation of endothelial CD200 respectively on immune
responses to stroke. Aim 3 will evaluate the role of neuronal CD200 signaling in post-stroke inflammation
and stroke outcomes. Neuronal CD200 CKO mice (CD200fl/fl:Eno2-Cre) and lenti-CD200 virus on neuronal
promotor Enolase 2 (Eno2) will be used. As CD200-CD200R signaling functions in various
neuroinflammatory diseases, the proposed project will open up a new area of CD200-CD200R research not
only in stroke, but also in other central nervous system disorders."

Hearing loss (HL) is the most common sensory disorder affecting more than 28 million Americans and affects
15-26% of the world's population. Amongst the elderly, it ranks as the most common neurological disability,
impacting ~50% of octogenarians. Clinically significant HL is present in at least 1 per 500 infants at birth.
Recent advances in molecular technology continues to revolutionize human genetics. However, there is a
pressing need to continue identifying new human HL genes and determining causative variants in known NSHL
genes for completing a genomic and phenotypic database. This is critical as we and others have provided direct
evidence of further genetic heterogeneity of HL with a number of genes/mutations yet to be identified.
Importantly, as shown in our preliminary studies, we established the comprehensive and integrated scope -
Miami Ear Institute Otogenetic Program (MEIOP) and pipelines including existence of aggregated, clinically
well-defined WES/WGS/RNAseq/non-coding causative variation and multi-omics and gene panel datasets; data
analysis platform, established the diverse Miami Otogenetic Repository (MOR) (including 60% US minorities)
that contains biological samples and clinical data on families with NSHL, a productive functional follow-up,
including model systems (cells, zebrafish); and in silico approaches of machine learning supported pathogenicity
predictions, and statistical variant burden analysis for the genetic and functional analysis of variants. In this
competitive renewal, our overarching goals are to further improve the clinical care of persons with HL and
provide a more robust foundation for therapies that target specific types of genetic HL. We will achieve these
goals by addressing current knowledge gaps as reflected in the following specific aim 1,1: To determine
causative variants in known NSHL genes and expand our minority focused populations using our well
established multi-tier genomic profiling approach. Aim 1.2: To identify novel NSHL genes using targeted
sequence capture/ whole exome/genome analysis using a customized local pipeline platform and functional
and multi-omics analysis. Aim 2: To enhance the investigation of novel disease mechanisms through
cellular/tissue assays and animal models of rare and common human HL genes/variants. Our approaches will
include functional analysis of wild type and mutant proteins in iPSCs, inner ear organoids, and animal models,
followed by characterization of their inner ear phenotypes and function. The completion of these aims will be
discoveries of novel coding and non-coding variants in genes and pathways involved in the pathophysiology of
deafness, improve clinical care for persons with hearing loss, provide a better genetic foundation for precision
medicine for the hearing impaired, and identify new targets for gene therapy for deafness in USA populations,
especially in USA minorities."

Organophosphate (OP) compounds include pesticides and chemical warfare nerve agents. They are highly
toxic and can produce a cholinergic crisis that rapidly progresses into status epilepticus (SE) and even death
without emergency care. The standard-of-care (SOC) treatment with atropine, pralidoxime, and midazolam has
dramatically improved survival after OP intoxication. Yet, many survivors of OP-SE exhibit brain injury,
cognitive impairments, and spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). In addition, both acute and protracted
neuro-inflammation and increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been reported following OP
SE. These persistent neuroinflammatory changes are thought to underlie neurodegeneration, network hyper-
excitability, and maladaptive plasticity, leading to cognitive dysfunction and SRS. Thus, mitigating neuro-
inflammation is a primary target in alleviating neuronal injury and behavioral morbidities following OP SE.
Verapamil (VPM) is a water-soluble calcium-channel blocker for high blood pressure and angina treatment.
Recent findings have also demonstrated the potent neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory action of VPM in
various CNS injuries. Our preliminary results showed that intramuscular VPM (10 mg/kg, i.m.) was safe and
produced significant neuroprotection and decreased neuroinflammation in multiple brain regions when
administered after the termination of DFP SE. It was also associated with decreased pro-inflammatory and
upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Finally, this effect had a functional outcome since VPM improved
anxiety and cognitive impairment at eight weeks post-DFP SE. Thus, this UG3-UH3 will investigate and
optimize a VPM therapy as a potential countermeasure for treating OP SE that could be rapidly administered in
the field. Studies will employ DFP-SE rat model to conduct the Specific Aims: In Aim 1, the safety of repeated
i.m. injections will be assessed along with an assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters and the stability of
VPM formulation. In Aim 2, the effects of VPM treatment on reducing neuronal death and neuroinflammation
after DFP SE will be evaluated utilizing Fluoro-Jade C along with Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein and Ionized
calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 immunohistochemical staining, respectively. We will also assess the effect
of VPM therapy on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression. In Aim 3, VPM therapy will be optimized by
studying the effects of various VPM doses and treatment durations on neurodegradation and
neuroinflammation. In Aim 4, the functional outcomes of optimized VPM therapy on long-term anxiety,
cognitive impairment, and SRS will be tested using a battery of rodent behavioral assays and EEG techniques.
We will also draft a preliminary target product profile (TPP) by the end of our studies. These studies will
provide further insight into the role of neuroinflammatory mechanisms in mediating OP morbidities and
optimizing a VPM-based anti-inflammatory therapy as a novel countermeasure drug to alleviate OP toxicities."
10930834,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuft cells are rare cholinergic chemosensory epithelial cells capable of producing an unusual spectrum of
biological effector molecules, such as interleukins, eicosanoids and neurotransmitters. Previous studies have
shown that tuft cells are capable of triggering immune responses in different organs (e.g., intestine and airways)
via G protein-coupled receptor-dependent pathways, involving components of chemosensory transduction.
Although tuft cells have been detected in salivary glands, their functions in this organ are unknown. The aims of
this project are designed to utilize modern technologies to explore tuft cells biology in salivary gland epithelium
as well as their role in innate and adaptive immunity. The K99 phase proposes to (1) to investigate tuft cell
distribution and function in salivary gland epithelium through advanced microscopic techniques as well as in vivo
experiments; (2) to determine tuft cell chemosensory components in salivary gland epithelium using single cell
analysis; (3) to determine the effects of tuft cell on salivary gland innate immunity using tuft cell ablation in vivo
model. During this time the candidate will complete mentored training in molecular immunology and biology,
high-resolution microscopy, single cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics as well as courses in
professional development. The independent R00 phase will investigate the role of tuft cells in salivary gland
adaptive immunity utilizing Sjögren’s syndrome-like mouse models and human specimens. Together, the new
generated information will allow a better understanding of tuft cell biology in salivary gland and allow therapeutic
targets for salivary gland diseases."

Short sleep duration is linked with obesity risk in children.1, 2 The prevalence of short sleep duration is 35%
among American preschoolers (3 to 5-year-olds) and 53% for Black-American children,3 a glaring health
disparity. Sleep disparities in young Black children are hypothesized to be due to social determinants of
health, including structural racism and poverty that permeate multiple socio-environmental levels of children’s
lives, especially through parenting practices.4-6 Establishing a regular bedtime routine has been recognized as
a modifiable parenting behavior to optimize sleep duration. And, digital technology offers an acceptable
platform to reach Black families of young children.7 My long-term career objective is to bridge access of
evidence-based interventions to Black families via dissemination and implementation science strategies
integrated into community systems. My career goal is to become an independent scientist in sleep health
interventions to reduce health disparities through family-centered research. This K01 proposal aims to increase
access of Black parents of young children to evidence-based strategies known to optimize sleep health. My
specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop a digital prototype of evidence-based strategies for establishing a bedtime
routine based on using a mixed methods approach (i.e., focus groups and survey data) that considers the
lived experiences of 20 Black families of 3- to 5-year-olds with sleep problems; Aim 2: Test the feasibility of the
intervention content and digital implementation procedure and iteratively develop the intervention through user
journey methods (i.e., cognitive walk-through and think-aloud sessions), and implementation feasibility
questionnaire with the same 20 Black families engaged in Aim 1; and Aim 3: Test the acceptability and
estimate the impact of the optimized digital intervention through a single-arm pilot study with 40 Black families
of 3- to 5-year-olds with sleep problems. Primary outcomes are: Parent knowledge, parenting practices related
to establishing bedtime routines, child sleep duration and child bedtime resistance. To achieve this objective,
my career development plan includes: 1) obtain training and expertise in behavioral sleep medicine, 2) build
expertise in dissemination and implementation science strategies, related to parent engagement; 3) gain
hands-on experience conducting an integrated family-centered evidence-informed digital sleep intervention to
improve sleep in the family unit; and 4) biostatistical analysis and clinical trial design skills. At NYU Grossman
School of Medicine’s Department of Population Health, I will have access to resources from the Department,
the Division of Health and Behavior, the Center for Early Childhood Health and Development, NYU Langone
Family Health Centers, and the Institute for Excellence in Health Equity, directed by my advisor Dr. Ogedegbe."

Research: Asthma is the most common chronic disease of children living in urban centers, and exposure to rat
allergen can trigger asthma in children who are sensitized. The goal of this award is to evaluate the relationship
between rat exposure and asthma severity in children using novel techniques to estimate rat exposure, including
ecological studies of rat population dynamics and publicly available rat-related 311 complaint calls, around the
home and school environment. Established cohorts of inner-city children enrolled in the School Inner-City
Asthma Study (SICAS) and Environmental Assessment of Sleep in Youth (EASY) study (PI, Dr. Wanda
Phipatanakul) will be used to study the impact of rat exposure on pediatric asthma severity. This study is unique
and novel because it will be the first to evaluate the relationship between rat population dynamics on asthma
severity. Results may lead to interventional trials designed to reduce commensal rodent abundance as a primary
prevention measure to reduce exposure to the allergens they produce.
Career Development: Dr. Marieke Rosenbaum is a veterinarian and public health scientist who seeks to
integrate clinical research and veterinary medicine to design interventions that reduce the negative impact of
urban peri-domestic wild animals on human health. Over the course of this award, Dr. Rosenbaum will gain
important human clinical research skills, learn advanced statistics and modeling, and explore community
engagement as the three pillars of her K08 training program. The proposed research and Dr. Rosenbaum’s
career trajectory closely align with NIEHS 2018-2023 strategic themes 1 (Advance Environmental Health
Science) and 2 (Promoting Translation – Data to Knowledge to Action) by opening a new line of transdisciplinary
investigation about the urban environment, rat exposure, and pediatric asthma.
Environment: Dr. Rosenbaum will be mentored by Dr. Phipatanakul, an expert in epidemiology, clinical trials,
and clinical investigation in asthma and allergic diseases. Her team of advisors include Jon Runstadler (DVM,
PhD), Jessica Leibler (DrPH, MS), and Janis Breeze (MPH), who together with the primary mentor have
committed their time, resources, and expertise to facilitate Dr. Rosenbaum’s career development and successful
completion of the proposed project. During this award period, Dr. Rosenbaum will complete course work and
training at Tufts University, Boston University, and Harvard University, and she will be supported by the Tufts
University Clinical Translational Science Institute, which offers career development training for junior faculty. The
academic environment created by the mentor and institutions and their affiliates provides an optimal environment
for learning and collaborating specific to the proposed research and training."

10877814,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In malignancies, CD8+ T cells can recognize and eliminate tumor cells, but often fail to cure disease due
to their progressive loss of antitumor function resulting from chronic activation in the immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment. In response to infection in healthy tissues, T cells differentiate into tissue-resident memory
cells (TRM), and after clearance of antigen can remain lodged in tissues to survey and provide protection from
reinfection. When TRM-like T cells are found in cancer patient tumors, improved responses to immunotherapy
and better patient outcomes are observed. However, whether TRM-like TIL represent ‘progenitors’ of exhausted
TIL, or are a separate cell state outside the exhaustion spectrum is still unclear.
 To better understand the relationship among TRM-like TIL, exhaustion states, and TRM memory cells, we
directly compared TRM from acute viral infection and exhausted TIL from tumors to find transcriptional differences
between these distinct T cell states. Focusing on genes highly expressed by TRM that may mediate their
enhanced functions in tissues, we asked which of those were downregulated as T cells became terminally
exhausted, coincident with loss of function. This approach identified numerous genes related to protein
regulation, including multiple under-characterized E3 ubiquitin ligases. Protein regulation by the ubiquitin
proteosome system is an essential biological process for homeostasis, crucial for cell differentiation and function,
and has been previously shown to be important for memory T cell identity. Correlated with our preliminary data,
we found that exhausted TIL have an excess of unfolded proteins in their cytosol, and when we enforced
expression of the identified E3 ubiquitin ligases in tumor-specific T cells, it allowed for better tumor control and
improved mouse survival. Therefore, we propose to explore the relationship between protein homeostasis and
TRM, exhaustion, and TRM-like TIL cell fates. Aim 1 seeks to understand if the identified E3 ubiquitin ligases
influence exhaustion or TRM cell fate by using mouse models of cancer to enforce expression or knock out these
ligases and study exhaustion T cell fate, or to enforce expression or knock out the ligases in acute viral infection
and study TRM cell fate. Aim 2 seeks to identify the protein-interaction targets of these E3 ubiquitin ligases by in
vitro BioID proximity labeling assay and mass spectrometry, then verify the targets in vivo TIL and determine if
expression of these ligases in TIL can decrease unfolded protein abundance. Understanding the relationship
between T cell exhaustion and TRM can provide vital new insights into the biology of these two differentiated T
cell populations and inform efforts to manipulate T cell fates towards TRM-like TIL to benefit cancer
immunotherapy."
10899675,"Project Abstract
There are over 20 million sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults in the United States. SGM adults experience
significant health inequities such as higher risk for Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), higher
prevalence and severity of chronic health conditions, and higher risk for multiple cancers. SGM discrimination
likely accelerates aging, disrupts use of preventive care, and creates barriers to health systems when they are
sick. The overall objective is to understand the relationship between provider- and policy-level factors to improve
aging and health outcomes of midlife and older SGM adults. In Specific Aim 1, we will estimate population-level
prevalence of subjective cognitive decline (SCD), severity of SCD, and receipt of informal care for SCD-related
impairments using data from the 2015-2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). This is the
largest probability sample of sexual minority (SM) adults available and all analyses will be stratified by sex and
sexual orientation for the first time in public health research. We hypothesize that SM adults will report higher
SCD prevalence and ADRD risk, but lower access to informal care provided by a spouse or family member. In
Specific Aim 2, we will examine the relationship between 7 provider-level attitudes and practices towards SGM
patients and preventive healthcare use (e.g., receiving colorectal cancer screenings, flu vaccinations) and level
of cognitive impairment. This aim leverages novel panel data on midlife and older SGM adults from the NIA-
funded Vanderbilt University Social Networks, Aging, and Policy Study (VUSNAPS). In Specific Aim 3, we will
estimate the association of state policies legally permitting denial of health services based on sexual orientation
and rates of preventive healthcare use, health status, and health behaviors among SM adults. In this aim, we
will use BRFSS data and a difference-in-differences design to compare SM adults in states with and without
legal denial policies. Results have significant implications for midlife and older SGM adults — an NIA priority
population. By using the largest probability sample of SM adults available, we are able to stratify by sex and
sexual orientation. These nuanced findings may inform policies regarding long-term supports and services to
meet the needs of sub-populations with both SCD-related impairments and elevated risk for ADRD. Additionally,
we use novel panel data on SGM midlife and older adults to identify provider-level predictors of preventive care.
Research insights may inform larger scale interventions to improve attitudes and practices with SGM patients at
the health system-level."

and community engaged research; 3) developing of a pilot studies program to support UiM early career investigators. Rates
of ADRD are increasing drastically, with the greatest burden among minorities. Much of ADRD research has been focused
on understanding the biology of disease, with less focus on behavioral health interventions for primary, secondary and
tertiary prevention. Further, the burden of ADRD impacts not only the affected persons but also their informal care partners.
There is a critical need for research to translate scientific advances into behavioral health interventions in both community
and hospital settings to decrease ADRD burden for minority patients, care partners and dyads. The REC will directly address
this need by leveraging: the interdisciplinary expertise at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston Medical Center
(BMC), Cambridge Health Alliance and affiliated clinics; the outstanding resources of Harvard and Boston University
including MADRC, BU-ADRC; a NIA funded behavioral health ADRD R25; and numerous other important collaborators
in the Boston area. The REC will also work closely to integrate activities and mentoring with other AD/ADRD RCMARs.
The REC will be co-led by Ana-Maria Vranceanu (clinical psychologist) with expertise in behavioral health, ADRD, health
disparities and community-engaged research, and a strong track record of mentoring, and Maureen O’Connor (clinical
psychologist) who has expertise in ADRD and neuropsychology and leads the BU-ADRC REC. Specific aims are: 1) to

10900458,"ABSTRACT:
Nearly 250,000 adults are affected by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Bruton’s Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(BTKIs) dramatically improve survival in CLL. However, up to 38% of patients develop atrial fibrillation (AF) and
other cardiovascular toxicities. Ibrutinib is the first BTKI approved which has these toxicities but our data suggest
new BTKIs (e.g., acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib) still associate with cardiotoxicity. The development of AF with BTKIs
is challenging and is a major impediment in use of the effective therapies in patients. Thus, there is an urgent
need to identify patients at risk for AF, and better understand targetable pathways that induce BTKI-associated
AF. Our group has defined most of the early cardio-oncology issues with BTKIs. We have also developed animal
models which suggest that BTKIs cause direct cardiotoxicity as well as an activation of the innate immune
response that potentially contributes to cardiotoxicity and arrhythmia, and result in an early increase in left atrial
(LA) fibrosis and volume (LA remodeling) preceding BTKI-associated AF. We will leverage the active cardio-
oncology programs and resources here at OSU and at UCSF, to prospectively study these cardiovascular effects
of BTKIs in humans. Our pre-clinical studies specifically implicate activation of the innate immune response,
marked by elevation in circulating IL-6 (and IL-17) as key mediators of BTKI-associated AF development, and
that this leads to LA remodeling and cardiotoxic AF. Yet, there are no prospective studies testing the effects of
immune activation in mediating or predicting cardiotoxic events. To address these translational and clinical gaps,
we will recruit 120 CLL patients initiating BTKIs and we will prospectively utilize serial cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging (CMR) and leading-edge immunologic techniques to test our hypothesis, that BTKI-
associated AF is driven by increased immune activation that induces cardiac remodeling and arrythmia. In Aim
1, we test the effect of BTKIs on LA fibrosis and volume pre-, 2, and 6 months after starting BTKI-therapy. We
will determine the burden of BTKI-associated AF by applying serial mobile ECG monitoring over 1-year post-
BTKI initiation. These results will be compared to 60 age-, gender-, and cardiac risk matched controls with early
stage CLL, treated with standard observation alone. As we have observed that >50% of BTKI treated patients
develop hypertension, we will also measure and relate ambulatory blood pressure to CMR measures. In Aim 2,
we will examine the effects of BTKIs on innate immune response that define vulnerability to remodeling and
clinical AF by studying circulating levels of IL-6, IL-17, and using unbiased single-cell genomics, systematically
decipher the immune cells that contribute to remodeling and their key pro-inflammatory pathways. We will also
define the relation of these parameters with other CMR measures. Finally, using our BTKI animal model, we will
test the effect of targeted inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways on cardiotoxic remodeling and AF risk. Upon
completion, we will gain important insights into the mechanistic role of the kinase inhibitors in cardiotoxicity as
well as how immune dysregulation contributes to arrhythmia in hematological malignancies."

The aged brain is thought to be more vulnerable to stresses than its young counterpart, and different in
its coping with neuroinflammation and ability to repair an injury. A better understanding of the brain
aging process will provide valuable information. This knowledge enables one to mitigate age-related
declines in cognitive, emotional, sensory, and motor functions. Such information may also promote
effective strategies for treating age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease
(AD).
 The brain is composed of multiple types of non-neuronal cells besides neurons, and each type
seems to undergo unique age-related changes following its genetic program. Oligodendrocytes (OLs),
a major glial cell population, form myelin sheaths, essential for rapid axonal conduction in the central
nervous system (CNS). OLs also provide metabolic and nutritional support to neurons and contribute to
other homeostatic regulations for axonal communication. Recently, our OL-specific transcriptomic
analyses revealed that IL-33, a member of the IL-1 family known to contribute to neural circuit refining
and neural repair, is increasingly expressed in OLs with age. Consequently, at one year of age, OLs
become the predominant source of IL-33 (> 90% of all IL33-expressing cells) in the mouse CNS.
Interestingly, IL-33 genetic variations are correlated with the risk of AD in patients, and higher levels of
IL-33 in the brain significantly benefited amyloid plaque clearance in mice. Given the critical functions of
IL-33, it is crucial to identify detailed source cell-specific mechanisms of IL-33 in the aged brain. To
understand how OL-derived IL-33 shapes brain aging and AD-like disease progression, we will employ
mouse genetic tools that allow OL-specific IL-33 conditional knockout (cKO) or overexpression. We will
examine the effects of those genetic manipulations on OL survival and myelin maintenance in the aged
brain. Moreover, these IL33-related genetic manipulations will be applied to a mouse model of AD
(APP/PS1), and we will determine whether OL-derived IL-33 regulates AD-like diseases and cognitive
deficits, as well as microglia-mediated clearance of beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposits. The same genetic
manipulations will also be used on astrocytes; thus, the relative importance of OL-derived IL33 will be
compared with astroglial IL33.
 If successfully conducted, this study will advance our understanding of cell-cell interactions,
especially those mediated by IL-33 in brain aging and during AD progression. Our results may promote
the development of a therapeutic strategy with an oligodendroglia-targeted approach and identify
related molecular mechanisms and targets for treating AD patients."

Mating, host-seeking and blood-meal-acquisition behaviors in disease-carrying mosquitoes are facilitated by an
array of chemosensory and feeding appendages that are critical for transmission cycles. In order to find a mating
partner or distinguish host odor cues (kairomones) from numerous other environmental stimuli, Anopheles
coluzzii mosquitoes use a keen sense of smell/taste that relies on at least three large families of chemosensory
receptors: these are the gustatory (AcGrs), odorant (AcOrs) and variant ionotropic (AcIrs) receptors that are
expressed in peripheral chemosensory tissues and convey information about the chemical environment to the
brain. In contrast to the highly divergent and relatively well-studied AcOr family, the AcIr family of chemoreceptors
is largely conserved and relatively poorly understood.
Preliminary studies from our group utilizing state-of-the-art transgenic reporters and gene-targeting approaches
have begun to explore the expression and function of AcIr76b, one of the triad of obligate IR co-receptors. These
studies confirm broad expression profiles and, more importantly, have begun to elucidate the essential role that
IR signaling plays in mediating responses to many odor cues that underlie important mosquito behaviors, such
as mating and host seeking/blood feeding. This has led us to hypothesize that AcIrs play a critical role in neuronal
sensitivity to as-yet undefined mating and blood-feeding cues as well as several well-established human skin
odorants in sensilla that reside on the adult antennae, maxillary palps, labella, and tarsi. For example, grooved-
peg sensilla are responsive to important human-derived kairomones—such as ammonia, lactic acid and
butylamine—yet the neurons housed within them express AcIr76b and other AcIrs but not AcOrs. In this
proposal, we seek to comprehensively elucidate the molecular functionality of AcIrs and their potential roles as
host kairomone, mating and blood-feeding receptors and thus clarify key components of the chemosensory
processes in the malaria vector mosquito An. coluzzii. Broadening our understanding of the host-seeking, blood-
feeding, and mating biology of An. coluzzii and indeed other disease-transmitting mosquitoes in which Irs are
extremely well conserved may have important future implications for human health by providing new ways to
interfere with disease transmission."

based modalities such as shear wave elastography. This proposal seeks to explore a new approach for efficient
ultrasound electronics integration that allows access to pre-beamformed RF data with manageable digital data
rates and uncompromised imaging speed, through studying the application of compressed sensing (CS) to
ultrasound imaging at the integrated circuit level. The PI and Co-I propose to develop a novel CS framework that
performs spatial and temporal compression of full channel RF data compression together with the analog-to-
digital conversion, enabling concurrent reduction on the data volume, sampling rate, and circuit footprint. A
prototype CS digital ultrasound SoC containing on-chip ADCs and data links and fully compatible with potentially
catheter-based reduced cable imaging will be designed, implemented, and benchmarked against conventional
imaging systems. The long-term goal of this exploratory research program is to lay the foundations for next
generation integrated front-end circuits for medical ultrasound imaging, providing the important theories, models,
circuit techniques, as well as the design space and limitations for emerging portable and wearable systems."
10851925,"Technical Abstract
Americans with African ancestry (AAs) make up 12-15% of the US population, but account for
35% of ESKD. This disparity is partly attributed to the carriage of exonic variants in APOL1 (G1,
G2 risk alleles) within AAs, while all ancestries carry the major allele (G0). Only 10-15% with risk-
genotype develop progressive CKD, suggesting “second hits” are needed. In kidney
transplantation, the risk of progressive CKD in living donors (LDs) is a vital concern. Compared
to white LDs, AA-LDs have a higher risk of CKD/ESKD along with increased risks of hypertension
and inflammatory glomerulonephritis. Since the identification of APOL1-G1/G2 risk-genotypes,
whether and how risk-genotype among AA-LDs contributes to the observed increased post-
donation ESKD risk in AAs has remained a central question. In human LDs, significantly long
follow-up times will be needed to understand actual donation-attributable risk with APOL1-variants.
In light of these data, delineating the “second or third hits” that would modify disease risk in LDs
with APOL1 risk-genotype, needs examination using a suitable model system. Here, we take
advantage of our human BAC transgenic mice (BAC-Tg) expressing physiologic levels of APOL1
G0, G1, or G2 which we identify as recapitulating observed human immunologic and kidney
phenotypes including CKD. We perform unilateral nephrectomy to model live donation, and
specifically examine two putative second hit phenomena. In aim-1, we will test the hypothesis that
nephrectomized G1- and G2- BAC-Tg develop hypertension-related progression of CKD. To
induce hypertension in our mice, we will use models of dietary salt-loading, and also test sodium
restriction as a therapeutic strategy. Detailed hemodynamic and histo-morphometric studies will
provide mechanistic insight in this aim. Based on our recent identification of an immunologic role
for APOL1-G1 and G2 variants, in Aim-2 we will mimic systemic immune activation in
nephrectomized BAC-tg lines. Our goal here is to define the role and mechanism of Ifng-induced
glomerulopathy in APOL1 BAC transgenic mice post-nephrectomy using novel doxycycline-
inducible IFNG-expressing BAC-Tg lines. Novel Podocin rtTA TRAP mice will be utilized to
identify differentially expressed genes to identify mechanisms in the pathogenesis of APOL1-
induced FSGS, simultaneously comparing podocytes from uninephric and binephric mice.
This proposal combines an array of different skill sets and unique tools to address critically
important mechanistic and epidemiologic questions in transplantation, with the potential to reveal
novel therapeutics for APOL1 - a profoundly unmet need."

This proposal will address the critical need to define for cannabinoid exposure: 1) the most sensitive
developmental exposure windows; 2) the dose- and sex-dependence of adverse outcomes; 3)
developmentally relevant molecular mechanisms of persistent adverse effects; and 4) the relative
developmental toxicity of other cannabinoids available to consumers. Cannabis/∆9-tetrahydro-
cannabinol (THC) is the most commonly used illicit drug by pregnant women, and cannabidiol (CBD)
is readily available over the counter with suggested benefits in pregnancy for morning sickness, stress,
and sleeplessness. Similarly, other minor cannabinoids are marketed directly to consumers with
numerous health claims. Because of maternal use, pre- and post-natal cannabinoid exposures occur
during critical stages of children’s brain development despite our lack of understanding of the acute
and long-term consequences. In addition, cannabinoid exposure (e.g. via vaping) frequently occurs
during adolescence, another sensitive time of brain development and neuronal pruning. In our zebrafish
model system, we have observed persistently altered adult behavior after embryos were exposed to
THC and CBD during early development. Our central hypothesis is that exposure to cannabinoids
causes alterations in inflammatory mediators in the developing brain leading to the persistent
alterations in behavior throughout development and into adulthood. Our research framework, depicted
as an adverse outcome pathway (AOP), will specifically investigate three aims to measure: 1)
morphological and persistent behavioral alterations in anxiety/locomotion; 2) time-of-exposure
susceptibilities; and 3) neuroinflammation resulting from THC and CBD developmental exposure. We
will use the highly relevant, predictive, and high throughput zebrafish model, including three transgenic
lines, to assess the spatial and temporal relationships between microglial response, gene expression,
and persistent behavioral adverse outcomes. Cannabinoid-mediated changes in neuroinflammation
gene/protein expression and altered cellular trajectories will be identified using single nucleiRNAseq
and LC-MS/MS protein validation in larval and adult brains. The dependence of the specific cannabinoid
receptors in observed toxicities will be determined by using cannabinoid receptor 1 and 2 null lines.
Our ongoing and productive collaborations, including work with three NIH-COBRE core facilities, will
be leveraged to inform the developmental origins of health and disease caused by cannabinoid
exposure. The proposed research is significant because it will provide new, relevant information to
guide cannabinoid policy and healthcare decisions made by pediatricians, obstetricians, and policy-
makers needed to ensure public health and safety."

Sarcopenia (low muscle mass) and diabetes are two highly prevalent and disabling chronic health conditions
affecting older women. There is emerging evidence that diabetes and impaired insulin-glucose homeostasis
may accelerate age-related loss of muscle mass. It is critically important to examine modifiable risk factors
(e.g., muscle mass, dysglycemia) that contribute to risk of functional impairment, falls and fractures (the 3Fs) in
older adults. Our study will address a key knowledge gap: the extent to which insulin-glucose homeostasis is
associated with loss of muscle mass over time in aging women and whether this varies by race/ethnicity.
Moreover, this study will examine the feedback loop between impaired insulin-glucose homeostasis and loss of
skeletal muscle mass. Until recently, the ability to fully characterize change in muscle mass in large studies of
community dwelling older adults has been limited by challenges associated with obtaining measures of muscle
mass. This is a critical barrier to progress. This project will use a novel at-home remote sample collection
protocol (D3Cr method) and finger-prick blood collection kit to examine longitudinal change in muscle mass
and insulin-glucose homeostasis in 3177 postmenopausal women from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI).
The WHI is a large, ongoing prospective cohort study of postmenopausal women with 30 years of follow-up.
Study participants will be drawn from a WHI sub-cohort, the Long Life Study 2 (LLS2), a diverse cohort of older
women (56% from racial/ethnic minority groups; mean age 85 years). The study aims are to: 1) provide insight
into longitudinal patterns of change in D3Cr-muscle mass in postmenopausal women as they age, and their
risk for functional decline increases, by race/ethnicity, diabetes status, and according to level of glycemic
control, 2) examine the cyclical relationship between impaired insulin-glucose homeostasis and change in
D3Cr-muscle mass using advanced statistical approaches, and 3) use machine learning methods to develop
multivariate risk stratification algorithms, including D3Cr-muscle mass, indices of impaired insulin-glucose
homeostasis, and objective measures of functional capacity (grip strength, gait speed), to identify
postmenopausal women at highest risk of the 3 Fs. This project addresses an urgent need identified by the
NIA for research on geroscience, including research that determines the rate of aging processes and
mechanisms underlying age-related change. In the future, these results will be used to develop interventions
designed to mitigate harmful effects of sarcopenia and diabetes and promote healthy aging in postmenopausal
women, including women from racial/ethnic minority groups that are typically underrepresented in health
research."

T cell–mediated autoimmune diseases result from the breakdown of tolerance mechanisms in self-reactive CD8
T cells. However, many aspects of autoimmune CD8 T cell differentiation remain enigmatic, including where and
how autoimmune T cell populations arise and are maintained and what molecular programs define autoimmune
T cell states. Type I diabetes (T1D) is a CD8 T cell–mediated autoimmune disease; T1D pathogenesis is complex
and involves immune infiltration of the pancreas and destruction of insulin-producing β cells by CD8 T cells. The
non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model is a clinically relevant model of T1D, which shares many features with
human disease. Utilizing the NOD model, we investigate autoimmune β cell-specific CD8 T cells differentiation
state dynamics over the course of T1D. We identified a stem-like progenitor CD8 T cell population in the
pancreatic lymph node that self-renews and gives rise to differentiated progeny, which migrate to the pancreas
and destroy β cells. The goal of this application is to generate a deep mechanistic understanding of the niche-
dependent intercellular interactions and signals in the pancreatic lymph node that maintain the autoimmune
stem-like progenitor T cell pool and regulate differentiation, and to use this knowledge to develop strategies for
therapeutic interventions. We will (i) employ innovative imaging and sequencing approaches to identify the
spatial organization of pancreatic lymph node niches that determine diabetogenic T cell responses, (ii) determine
the functional roles of key transcription factors controlling autoimmune T cell differentiation and test whether
deletion or enforced expression of these transcription factors can alter autoimmune T cell states, and (iii)
investigate autoimmune β cell-specific CD8 T cell states in human pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreas from
organ donors with T1D. If successful, the proposed studies will provide important insights into autoimmune β
cell-specific CD8 T cell programming in mouse and human T1D and could yield promising molecular and cellular
targets for the prevention or treatment of T1D and other T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases."
10911331,"Abstract
Abdominal obesity is tightly associated with a chronic low-grade inflammation that predisposes to insulin
resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes. Visceral adipose tissues, especially mesenteric adipose
tissue, exhibit depot-specific immune and metabolic differences compared with subcutaneous adipose tissue
and has been linked to varying degrees of metabolic diseases. Adiponectin is an adipokine that possesses anti-
diet-induced inflammation and insulin resistance functions. While the beneficial role of adiponectin is largely
explored in subcutaneous adipose tissue, the role of adiponectin in controlling peritoneal cavity organ
inflammation and mesenteric adipose tissue expansion remains largely unclear. The proposed study aims at
elucidating the role of adiponectin signaling in regulating macrophage function and metabolic homeostasis,
focusing on a new target of the adiponectin signaling pathway, the abhydrolase domain containing 17B
depalmitoylase (ABHD17B). The premise of the current study is based on several key findings made in our
preliminary studies: 1) the Abhd17b gene is selectively expressed in macrophage; its expression is greatly
reduced in adiponectinKO mice or high fat diet-fed mice; 2) Abhd17b deficiency exacerbates diet-induced
abdominal obesity, visceral organ inflammation, insulin resistance, and mesenteric adipose tissue expansion; 3)
Abhd17b deficient macrophage displayed impaired phagocytic ability and augmented inflammation. These data
suggest the role of ABHD17B in mediating the anti-inflammatory function of adiponectin in macrophage. Our
overarching hypothesis is that ABHD17B downregulation-induced macrophage dysfunction may be a key
mechanism underlying adiponectin deficiency-induced metabolic impairment in obesity. The studies described
in this proposal will test this hypothesis by characterizing the physiological roles of ABHD17B in mediating
adiponectin function and by characterizing the mechanism by which ABHD17B mediates the beneficial effects
of adiponectin on phagocytosis and anti-inflammation. Our multidisciplinary team of scientists will use genetic
mouse models and biochemical and cell-based assays to dissect the function and mechanism of ABHD17B in
regulating adiponectin signaling. Given the vast impact of abdominal obesity on human health, this proposed
work offers a unique and innovative approach to interrogate the functional roles and regulation of a new target
of adiponectin, ABHD17B, in mediating the anti-inflammation and anti-insulin resistant roles of adiponectin. The
mechanistical studies will help to develop new therapeutic treatment of abdominal obesity related metabolic
diseases including type 2 diabetes."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive, debilitating disease in critical need of disease-
modifying treatments. Emphysema, progressive lung destruction commonly encountered in subjects with COPD,
portends a poor prognosis. This project will leverage two large well-phenotyped, NHLBI-funded studies (the
COPDGene and Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC)) and the team’s extensive expertise in modern
imaging techniques, multi-omics data analysis, machine learning approaches, and in vitro functional validation.
The overall objective of this application is to identify novel multi-omics biomarkers and molecular subtypes of
centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns utilizing a systems biology approach to
understand relationships between the multiple omics data types. In Aim 1, we will apply the local histogram (LH)
chest computed tomography (CT) quantification method to generate imaging phenotypes of centrilobular,
panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in each lung lobe. We will cluster these lobar LH data to identify distinct
groups of subjects with similar LH patterns. We will then test for single-omics associations of the identified
emphysema clusters with genetic variants, DNA methylation marks, telomere length, gene expression, and
proteomics in peripheral blood and lung tissue samples. Aim 2 will develop and evaluate a lung-tissue informed,
blood-based multi-omics machine learning model for reliable clinical prediction of emphysema patterns. Timely
diagnosis calls for a blood-based predictive model as it may identify emphysema in subjects where CT scans
are not clinically indicated. This would also overcome the issues of radiation exposure and false positive findings
associated with CT scans. Aim 3 will discover molecularly-informed emphysema subtypes by applying an
innovative, interpretable, machine learning algorithm that captures directional feature interactions and provides
network representations of the molecular determinants of emphysema subtypes. We will then perform cluster
analysis on the Bivariate Shapley network representations to identify distinct subgroups of subjects based on
their graph similarity. To confirm the critical regulators of the identified pathways, we will conduct targeted gene
silencing and overexpression investigations in airway epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts. Genes will be
prioritized for functional validation utilizing existing biological knowledge and network analyses. Through a
combination of innovative, cutting-edge data generation, analytic approaches, and functional validation, this
project will make a significant contribution by enhancing emphysema phenotyping and multi-omics profiling for
a more robust prediction and a better understanding of disease pathobiology. Such knowledge will pave the way
for the development of much-needed novel and personalized therapeutic strategies."

 Demyelination represents the hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is also present in other diseases
including brain ischemia, traumatic brain injury and even Alzheimer’s disease. Currently, demyelinating
diseases are primarily imaged using MRI. Even though MRI is highly sensitive to demyelination, it is not
quantitative and it cannot distinguish demyelination from other potentially coexisiting pathological processes
such as inflammation or axonal loss. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) can provide quantitative and
biochemically specific information to complement MRI.
 We recently developed a PET radiotracer for demyelination based on the FDA-approved drug for MS 4-
aminopyridine (4AP) called [18F]3F4AP. We showed that this tracer be used to detect demyelination in rodent
models of MS and that it has good properties for imaging the brain in monkeys. In this project, we seek to
investigate the potential of this tracer for imaging demyelination in a model of traumatic brain injury and to
validate it in nonhuman primates and humans. The information gathered here will be crucial for the design and
interpretation of future human studies. Once validated, this tracer and could contribute to better monitoring of
demyelinating diseases and to the development of therapies to reverse demyelination."

The prevalence of ulcerative colitis (UC) in children continues to increase yearly. Recent evidence in pediatric
UC patients showed significant mitochondrial impairment in the colon tissues. This is important as optimal
mitochondrial activity is required for the solemn function of colonic stem cells that replenish the physical barrier
of the colon epithelium. Since patients are constantly exposed to environmental factors such as diet, it is critical
to reveal the dietary factors that influence mitochondrial function in the colon epithelium as they would be vital in
the management of UC in children. Sulfites are endogenous products of several sulfur-containing compounds,
and they are also ubiquitous in our diets as preservatives. My preliminary data in colon organoids derived from
pediatric patients showed a detrimental role of sulfite on mitochondrial metabolism and differentiation, with worse
metabolic outcomes in samples from pediatric UC patients. My analysis of transcriptomic data from 206 children
with UC showed that the Mocs1 gene required for downstream clearance of sulfites in the mitochondria is
downregulated in the colon of UC patients, suggesting a potential for inefficient sulfite detoxification in the colon.
In this study, I will use patient-derived colon organoids to define how sulfites regulate mitochondrial metabolism
and differentiation in health and in UC (Aim 1), reveal the sulfite-induced and sulfite susceptibility chromatin sites
in the pediatric colon that explains these metabolic and differentiation anomalies (Aim 2), and how sulfites and
the loss of epithelial Mocs1 shape colon biology in the complex gut environment in vivo using physiological
relevant models (Aim 3). This award will advance my training in disease models of IBD, epithelial biology, and
epigenomics as I work toward establishing an innovative career in regenerative nutrition with a focus on pediatric
digestive diseases and continue efforts to enhance diverse representation in the biomedical sciences."

10930913,"SUMMARY: PROJECT 1: TARGETING GLIOMA TISSUE STATES
Glioblastoma (GBM) displays extensive cellular heterogeneity which represents a major obstacle for effective
treatment. This cellular heterogeneity not only consists of multiple tumor cell mutation factors that drive distinct
tumor cell behavior, but also impacts various non-tumor cells, contributing to tumor initiation, progression, and
treatment response. In fact, GBM’s microenvironment is multifaceted and consists of soluble factors, extracellular
matrix components, tissue-resident cells (neuron, astrocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, etc.) and resident (e.g.
microglia) or recruited (e.g. bone-marrow derived macrophages) immune cells. Importantly, changes in the
cellular composition and cellular phenotypes can alter GBM tissue states to drive tumor growth and therapeutic
resistance. Thus, identifying the unique cellular composition and deciphering the multifaceted bidirectional
network between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment signals in various GBM tissue states can lead to
identification of novel therapeutic strategies.
Our preliminary studies using single nucleus RNAseq of pre- and post-treatment GBM has identified 3 tissue
states, corresponding to patterns of cohabitation of tumor and non-tumoral cell subpopulations. These
correspond to infiltrated brain, highly cellular proliferating tumor, and astrocytic / inflamed reactive tissue, which
is observed in the post-treatment samples and enriched in specific populations of myeloid cells and
mesenchymal glioma cells. Co-habitation of specific non-tumor cellular phenotypes in the glioma
microenvironment may influence glioma states signatures (astrocyte-like/mesenchymal, progenitor, proliferative)
that associate with tumor progression and therapeutic response. The goal of this project is to define the patterns
of cellular cohabitation associated with the tissue states and the cross-talk signals that influence local tissue
state, phenotypic expression, transitions and disease progression. Because of its known role in cross-talk
between specific populations in GBM, we will initially test the effects of targeting TWEAK-Fn14 signaling to drive
changes in tissue state. We hypothesize that targeting this as well as other key cross-talk signaling pathways
will induce tissue state transitions with corresponding alterations in cellular populations that will render tumors
more sensitive to therapeutic vulnerabilities and can be leveraged to slow tumor growth/progression.
To investigate the potential impact of such key states and their cross-talk, we propose three aims. Aim 1 focuses
on refining our understanding of glioma tissue states in both the pre- and post- treatment setting. Aim 2
investigates cross talk between the glioma cells and their microenvironment and how it may influence
progression. Aim 3 looks more locally at how cross-talk perturbations may impact tissue state transition."
10930915,"SUMMARY: PROJECT 2: IMAGING THE DYNAMIC TISSUE STATE IN PATIENTS IN VIVO
With a dismal median survival of 16 months, glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain
tumor within adult patients. Response to the standard-of-care (SOC) is widely variable across patients.
Identifying optimal targeted treatments traditionally relies on tissue sampling to identify patient-relevant targets.
Yet, tissue sampling has many severe limitations and costs (time, money, and facility access), and ultimately
provides only limited scope both spatially and temporally thus always leaving behind residual tumor cells that
have not been sampled. Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures an array of
complementary physiologic biomarkers that correspond with diverse tumor phenotypes (e.g., proliferation,
inflammation, angiogenesis), and it serves as the clinical mainstay for monitoring therapeutic response and
disease progression. As tumor cell signaling may be mediated through interactions (i.e.,“cross-talk”) with
surrounding non-tumoral cells in the regional microenvironment, there is a critical need to define the degree to
which this cross-talk influences local tissue state, phenotypic expression, and disease
progression. Understanding these associations should help refine the clinical interpretations of imaging
phenotypes to improve guidelines for non-invasive diagnosis and disease monitoring. There is an urgent need
for image-based radiomics tools that can 1) predict which patients will respond to a given treatment and 2) can
observe/track that response over time.
Overall Hypothesis: Tissue states, represented as combinations of cellular constituents and phenotypes, can be
resolved on clinical imaging to a level sufficient to identify transitions in these states with and without treatments
in individual patients in vivo.
Our two aims in this project investigate this hypothesis in two separate settings, Aim 1) Standard of Care, Aim
2) Immunotherapy. In these aims, we will characterize the landscape of phenotypic states, build image-based
models to predict tissue state from images, investigate how predicted tumor states correspond with outcomes,
quantify dynamics of states from pre- to post-therapy, and finally build mechanistic models to understand the
critical driving differences in the flow of cells in local phenotype state space leading to the overall tumor state."

The importance of Health Data Science in Africa cannot be overemphasized, as the burden of
infectious and non-infectious diseases is striking across the continent. Despite this, health data
science in Africa is grossly underdeveloped, which is mainly due to lack of well-trained data
scientists. In the last few years, there have been efforts to address the Data Science training
needs in Africa. However, these remain limited in scope and some of the crucial infectious
diseases such as zoonoses and food-borne infections, which take a significant toll on the
continent, have not been sufficiently addressed. The aim of the proposed training programme is
to enhance research into zoonoses and food-borne infections in West Africa through the
application of data science. We are proposing three training tracks as follows: (I) To provide a
one-year research training to MSc students in West Africa. In this training track, we will support
training of excellent candidates who have completed the first-year course work of a relevant MSc
programme. The candidates will undertake a research project on a topic that applies
bioinformatics, phylodynamics, and/or disease modelling to zoonoses or foodborne infections for
their dissertation. (ii) To provide a one-year research training to faculty members from West Africa.
In this training track, we will support early career scientists/faculty from universities and research
institutions who are interested in developing a research career in zoonoses or foodborne
infections. They will apply bioinformatics, phylodynamics and disease modelling tools in research
on zoonoses and food-borne infections. (iii) To organize workshops to provide hands-on training
in bioinformatics, phylodynamics and disease modelling to wider communities in West Africa. The
long-term goal is to establish a core of West African scientists who can carry out rigorous health
research projects using data science."
10890842,"Summary/ Abstract: The emergence of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized the
treatment for advanced cancers including lung cancer. Particularly, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy shows promising
therapeutic outcomes, and some of these therapies are employed as the first line treatment of patients with
metastatic NSCLC. However, not all patients benefit from ICB and some of patients who initially respond to ICB
develop acquired resistance and sometimes. multisystem immune-related adverse events. Thus, it is critically
important to accurately identify and predict lung cancer patients who will respond to ICB before and during a
course of treatment. Here, we propose an innovative screening strategy aiming at early prediction and real-time
monitoring of responders and non-responders to ICB for lung cancer patients. This approach is based on the
isolation, detection, and characterization of circulating exosomes specifically associated with anticancer immune
response rather than analyzing total pool of exosomes. Exosomes are secreted nano-sized particles containing
nucleic acid, protein, and lipid cargo specific to the cell of origin, which are considered as a mirror of the parental
cells. Besides, they can be easily extracted from biofluids as a source of biomarkers of disease status and
treatment response. Herein, we seek to specifically analyze two population of circulating exosomes including
tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs) and PD-L1+ exosomes that serve as the invaluable determinants of the status
of tumor burden and anticancer-immune activity, respectively. We have formulated two Specific Aims that hinge
on developing technologies to achieve our goals: Aim1 will develop a highly sensitive and selective sensing
platform for quantitative analysis of TEXs and PD-L1+ exosomes followed by molecular analysis of TEXs to
explore the molecular signatures associated with treatment outcome. For that, we will genetically engineer novel
bioluminescence-based probes by fusing bioluminescence proteins with tumor-specific and PD-L1-specific
targeting molecules, respectively. Aim 2 will evaluate circulating exosomes from serum of NSCLC patients
treated with ICB therapy. The platform developed in Aim 1 will be used for the quantitative analysis of TEXs and
PD-L1+ exosomes during the treatment, and whether the observed changes can be utilized as a predictive
marker for early identification and monitoring of responders and non-responders to ICB. The circulating TEXs
will be subsequently isolated; their exosomal transcripts, and long non-coding RNAs will be characterized by
using next-generation sequencing to explore the molecular signatures associated with therapeutic outcome. We
will apply computational approaches for data integration, analysis, and interpretation based on the number of
TEXs, expression level of exosomal PD-L1, molecular signatures of TEXs, and patient’s clinical features. In sum,
our project is highly translational and could have a significant impact on lung cancer patients. If successful, this
research will help physicians to accurately predict and identify patients who will benefit from ICB therapy, and
develop potential novel treatments for patients who are non-responders to ICB therapy."
10928175,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is incurable in ~30% of patients and, despite recent advances in CAR-
T cell therapies, remains a significant clinical challenge. One barrier to rationally targeted new therapies is the
remarkable heterogeneity of these tumors, which leaves as many as 20-50% of cases unclassified based on
cell-of-origin or more recent genetic-based classifications. This may be due in part to the fact that current
taxonomies are limited to the analysis of coding regions, representing only 3% of the genome, while further
genetic complexity of pathogenetic relevance may reside in the non-coding regulatory portion of the genome. To
this end, we recently investigated whether critical regulatory domains such as enhancers and super-enhancers
(SEs) could be the site of functionally relevant mutations in DLBCL. We found that regions corresponding to
active SEs are highly and specifically hypermutated in 97% of DLBCL cases, as compared to the same loci when
not active as SE. Such aberrant SE hypermutation displays signatures of AID activity and is linked to genes
encoding B cell regulators and well-established oncogenes. As evidence of oncogenic relevance, we showed
that the hypermutated SEs linked to the BCL6, BCL2, and CXCR4 proto-oncogenes prevent the binding and
transcriptional downregulation of the corresponding target gene by transcriptional repressors, including BLIMP1
(BCL6) and the steroid-receptor NR3C1 (BCL2 and CXCR4). Of note, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of the
SE hotspot mutation restored target gene regulation and impaired cell growth, indicating a key role for the SE
mutation in maintaining the transformed phenotype (Bal et al., Nature 2022). Overall, these findings identify a
highly pervasive, pathogenetically relevant, mutational mechanism that is likely to significantly influence the
current understanding of the somatic genetic landscape of DLBCL. The overall goal of this research program will
be to: i) identify and mechanistically dissect the top recurrently mutated/functionally relevant SEs and associated
target genes; ii) understand the role of the glucocorticoid receptor pathway, which appears to be commonly
targeted by the SE hypermutation mechanism as well as by direct coding mutations, in normal B cell biology and
lymphomagenesis. We anticipate that this new layer of genetic alterations will identify novel mechanisms of
dysregulation for known oncogenes, as well as new dysregulated genes and pathways, with implications for
precision classification and therapeutic targeting of DLBCL."
10738722,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for greater than 50% of
the 6 million HF cases nationwide, and the prevalence relative to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF) continues to rise at a rate of 1% per year, presenting an imminent need for further research addressing
the pathophysiology of this pervasive disease. The clinical presentation of HFpEF is defined by dyspnea upon
exertion and severe exercise intolerance, symptoms that are likely due, at least in part, to disease-related
changes in the peripheral circulation. While the mechanisms responsible for vascular dysfunction in HFpEF have
not been established, chronic inflammation and associated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
stemming from HFpEF-associated comorbidities and inactivity, appear to play a crucial role. The peripheral
vasculature of this patient group represents an area that is particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of ROS,
which interact with, and reduce bioavailability of, nitric oxide (NO). The proposed work thus seeks to examine
the mechanisms linking inflammation, vascular health, and exercise tolerance in Veterans with HFpEF, and
identifying which aspects of this cascade could be targeted to improve physical capacity and vascular function
in this patient group. Using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, a series of experiments are proposed
that will combine novel methodology with targeted pharmacologic interventions to selectively determine the
importance of NO substrate, enzymatic cofactor bioavailability, and inflammation/ROS to disease-related
changes in NO signalling in HFpEF. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that chronic enteral L-Citrulline
administration (100mg/kg) will increase NO substrate, leading to an increase in NO bioavailability and a
subsequent improvement in vascular function. Specific Aim 2 will explore whether administration of
tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor for endothelial NO synthase, can improve enzymatic coupling
and therefore restore vascular function in patients with HFpEF. Specific Aim 3 will evaluate the potential
pleiotropic properties of atorvastatin, a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, to reduce inflammation and oxidative
stress, leading to improvement in physical capacity and vascular function. Each Specific Aim will combine in vivo
and ex vivo assessments to comprehensively determine the impact of the proposed interventions on the cascade
of inflammation, oxidative stress and exercise intolerance in this patient group. Upon completion, it is anticipated
that the proposed work focused on developing a better understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to
impaired peripheral vascular function in HFpEF, and pinpointing novel strategies to alleviate vascular dysfunction
and promote physical cpacity, will translate directly into an improved ability to perform activities of daily living,
which is likely to lead to improved quality of life and a better prognosis in this Veteran patient group."
10738723,"Abstract: Good long-term social outcome of schizophrenia (SZ) subjects is as low as 14%. Because of this,
substantial number of SZ subjects suffer from severe and protracted disability. An important contributing factor
to poor long-term outcome in schizophrenia is cognitive impairments that are resistant to current treatments.
Therefore, it is critical to examine novel mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments to design new treatments.
Recent evidence suggests that brain cortical regions and white matter pathways that connect them adapt to
pathophysiological processes. Such adaptation can mitigate impairments in selected cognitive domains offering
hopes to target selected networks for interventions to improve outcome. Using state-of-art non-invasive
neuroimaging techniques, adaptation between the cortical neuropil (synapses, dendrites and its branches,
axonal endings and interneurons) and white matter integrity measured using characteristics of water diffusion in
white matter fibers can be investigated. The goal of this project is to characterize concurrent changes in cortical
neuropil and anisotropy of water diffusion in white matter fiber tracts as a model of neural circuitry adaptability
(NCA) and its impact on cognitive performance among SZ subjects compared to healthy control subjects (HC).
We will use phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) at ultra-high magnetic field (7 Tesla) that
provides greater sensitivity to investigate neuropil by measuring membrane phospholipid (MPL) metabolites in
multiple anatomically well-defined regions across the entire brain. MPLs are critical ingredients of neuronal
membranes that naturally form lipid bilayers separating the intra- and extra-cellular environments. During
development and disease, imbalance between synthesis and degradation of membranes can be reliably
captured. Broadly, higher MPL precursor levels are associated with membrane expansion while higher MPL
breakdown products suggest neuropil membrane contraction. Since such dynamic changes are prominently
observed in the neuropil, 31P MRS can provide a more specific measure of neuropil than structural imaging
measures that includes neuropil as well as interneuronal space, microvasculature and neuronal soma. Neurite
Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) - a state-of-the-art method to measure diffusion of water
along white matter tracts and neurite density- will be used to examine integrity of white matter pathways more
reliably than the older method of diffusion tensor imaging. Innovative nature of this proposal is highlighted by
concurrent changes in MPL metabolites and anisotropy as measures of NCA in relation to cognitive impairments
since using single modality imaging cannot measure adaptive changes in multiple tissues. Using our model of
NCA by employing multi-modal 31P MRS-NODDI data, we seek to examine association of NCA with cognitive
performance across the whole-brain (aim 1). Additionally, factors associated with NCA are unknown. Since SZ
is a highly heritable disorder, and inflammation is associated with SZ, we will examine the contribution of selected
genetic and peripheral inflammatory markers (Interleukin-6, IL6 and C-reactive protein, CRP) to NCA. Our
studies found association of Complement C4A (C4A) gene copy numbers with neuropil changes, and of IL-6 and
CRP levels with alterations in neuropil and white matter anisotropy. Based this evidence, our next aim is to
determine the association of C4A copy numbers and peripheral immune mediator levels with measures of NCA
among SZ and HC (aim 2). Application of integrated state-of-the-art methods to examine a less well understood
concept of NCA in SZ makes this proposal highly unique and can have significant impact on novel treatment
designs. These efforts may allow us to target adaptable tracts for novel interventions such as customized
cognitive enhancement therapies and electrical stimulation strategies using transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeted to selected networks."
10738724,"Multi-contrast MRI sequences before and after gadolinium enhancement of the carotid
plaque can significantly improve determination of stroke risk compared with simple
carotid stenosis measurements. While the improved depiction of plaque features with
MRI can be used to better individualize therapy for veterans with carotid disease, its use
has been limited because it requires gadolinium-based contrast agents, extended exam
times, and extensive interpretive training. To address these remaining limitations and
move our field forward into clinical application, our multicenter team of investigators will
combine our extensive collective experience in carotid MRI to develop a novel rapid non-
contrast quantitative carotid imaging method to automatically and accurately identify
vulnerable plaque components. Our goal is to establish a method for accurate carotid
plaque mapping that can be obtained with 1 to 3 MRI sequences taking ≤10 minutes for
the total plaque exam. To accomplish this goal, we will consolidate our different
quantitative carotid MRI sequences into two different methods of measuring these
quantitative parameters (NEW1 and NEW2). We will then compare these two methods
against each other and against the conventional multi-sequence contrast enhanced
carotid MRI method (CONV) in a study of 100 veterans with carotid disease at our 5
VAMC’s. Scans from repeat visits will be used to test repeatability of the parametric
measurements and will be performed with high-performance neck-shape-specific (NSS)
carotid coils. Our hypothesis is that vulnerable carotid plaque components (intraplaque
hemorrhage, lipid rich necrotic core, calcification, total plaque volume, and thin or
ruptured fibrous cap) can be accurately identified using rapidly acquired quantitative MRI
parameters (relaxation times, diffusion coefficient, and proton density signal intensity).
Specifically, that NEW1 or NEW2 or both are non-inferior to CONV in measuring plaque
components and equivalent or more accurate than CONV relative to histology. Aim 1 will
determine whether NEW1 or NEW2 is more repeatable, Aim 2 will determine whether
either or both are non-inferior to CONV in plaque component determination, and Aim 3
will determine the relative accuracy of the three methods, NEW1, NEW2, and CONV
compared with histology. This research will provide a rapid and reliable quantitative
approach for a comprehensive carotid artery exam. This will benefit veterans at risk for
stroke but presently under-treated because the diameter narrowing does not meet
criteria for intervention. It will spare others with stenotic but stable plaque the risk of
surgery. After demonstrating this method can automatically identify plaque features
without expert oversight at the 5 academic VAMCs, this technique will be directly
applicable in the community hospital setting. Although the technology has been
developed on a single vendor’s MRI platform, the NSS coils and related pulse
sequences developed will be transferrable to any MRI scanner hardware and applicable
to imaging other vascular territories and nonvascular tissue. This rapid non-contrast MRI
protocol will fundamentally change the clinical management of cerebrovascular disease."
10916450,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our highly successful multi-center Functional Assessment in Liver Transplantation (FrAILT) Study, funded by
the NIH since 2013, has definitively characterized physical frailty in patients with cirrhosis undergoing liver
transplantation (LT) and provided the foundation to codify physical frailty assessment through national guidelines
for cirrhosis/LT patient management. As we closed the knowledge gap around physical frailty, we identified a
new gap in LT patients—cognitive “frailty”, or more precisely, the manifestation of cognitive impairment. In 2 pilot
studies, we found that 30-60% of LT recipients met criteria for cognitive impairment. Yet, currently, the spectrum
of post-LT cognitive impairment—from subtle attentional changes to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD)—is not well characterized. As a result, clinicians do not screen for cognitive impairment in
the post-LT setting, and LT patients are not referred to specialists for timely diagnosis/management. In this
competing renewal, we will leverage our multi-center FrAILT Study to address this unmet need. We hypothesize
that LT patients experience premature cognitive syndromes, including ADRD, after LT (relative to the general
population), that cognitive impairment impacts post-LT global functional health, and that physical frailty is a major
predictor of post-LT cognitive impairment. There is strong scientific premise for these hypotheses, as many risk
factors for cirrhosis are linked with cognitive impairment. These include common ADRD comorbidities (e.g.,
diabetes, hypertension), heavy alcohol use, hepatic encephalopathy, post-LT delirium, and immunosuppression.
Physical frailty itself, prevalent in LT patients, shares common pathways with ADRD. The scientific goal of this
competing renewal is to deeply characterize the spectrum of cognitive impairment including ADRD in post-LT
patients. To accomplish this, we will extend the FrAILT Study at 6 U.S. sites and expand our assessment protocol
with neurocognitive screening in ~2,000 post-LT FrAILT patients. Additionally, we will establish new “neuro-
hepatology” collaborations with 5 of our sites’ AD Research Centers (ADRC) to conduct deep cognitive
profiling—through comprehensive neurocognitive assessments and brain imaging—in 150 post-LT patients who
display cognitive impairment. Specifically, we aim to: 1) Characterize the prevalence/incidence of and identify
factors associated with post-LT cognitive impairment and evaluate its association with post-LT global functional
health; 2) Characterize trajectories of cognitive function in the first year post-LT; 3) conduct deep cognitive
profiling to differentiate among the etiologies of dementia. Our established multi-center FrAILT Study is uniquely
poised to address this enormous unmet need for deep characterization of cognitive impairment in LT patients
who have a high burden of conventional ADRD risks but have traditionally been excluded from ADRD studies.
Further, we will develop a novel cohort with rich cognitive data that may yield novel insights into liver- and
transplant-related contributors to ADRD in other (general, solid organ transplant) populations."
10738747,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Can germline mutations cause strong resistance to otherwise lethal cancers? Certain germline genotypes might
be poorly supportive of tumor vascularization, nutritional demands, or resistance to immune attack, yet
compatible with host survival. Of particular interest, some mutations might abet the host response to neo-
antigens, or even to self-antigens highly expressed in syngeneic tumors. The identification of resistance
mutations could provide new approaches and targets for cancer therapy. At least in human populations,
resistance mutations would be very difficult to identify. Human germline genetic variability, stem variability among
cancer genomes, and the high frequency of humans who never develop cancer throughout their lives would
make mapping novel human resistance alleles all but impossible. In mice, finding such mutations is much easier.
Syngeneic tumor lines (with relatively stable genomes) exist for many inbred strains of Mus musculus. The inbred
mice themselves have a defined germline reference sequence. Each individual is homozygous at nearly all loci,
and almost genetically identical to all others. Over the past several years, we took advantage of this situation to
identify genes in which mutations confer cancer resistance. Using the random germline mutagen ENU, we
created third generation (G3) germline mutant mice (C57BL/6J strain). A total of 23,751 third-generation (G3)
mice from 561 pedigrees, bearing a total of 32,039 non-synonymous coding/splicing changes were enrolled into
a screen in which each mouse was injected subcutaneously with 2e5 B16F10 melanoma cells, and anti-PD-1
antibody was administered on days 5, 8, and 11. Tumor volume was measured on days 13 and 20. The G1 male
founder of each pedigree was sequenced to identify all non-synonymous coding/splicing mutations induced by
mutagenesis, and all G3 descendants were genotyped at all induced mutation sites in advance of screening.
Automated meiotic mapping allowed quick detection of even subtle phenotypes and assignment to causative
mutations. This screen yielded several mutations causing resistance to transplantable cancers. 14.2% saturation
of the autosomal genome was achieved in screening (fraction of autosomal genes with severely damaging or
destructive alleles tested in the homozygous state three times or more). Therefore, much remains undiscovered.
From what we know already, there is a realistic chance of translating genetic discoveries from this screen to
human cancer therapy. This proposal aims to extend screening for cancer resistance, and to further advance
mechanistic and translational studies of two resistance mutations, each in a gene with a human orthologue,
testing synergy between therapeutic approaches built around each protein target, and laying groundwork for
clinical applications."
10738748,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Physical, emotional, and social changes, including exposure to poverty, abuse, or violence, increases youth
vulnerability to mental illness. These factors interfere with development, limit opportunities, and hamper
achievement of a fulfilling life as adults. Addressing these issues can lead to improved outcomes at the
population level and better cost-effectiveness for health services. This should be especially important to low- and
middle-income countries, due to the substantial number of financially and socially vulnerable individuals in these
settings.
Cash transfer programs have been a promising way to address some of the social drivers for poor mental health
among youth. It has been shown that such programs can alleviate income restriction, increase schooling and
access to health facilities, and decrease alcohol consumption and violence in families. However, it is still unclear
which pathways and mechanisms explain the association between socioeconomic support and lower mental
illness among youth.
In this project, we will evaluate the effect of social drivers on youth mental health-related hospitalizations and
suicide, test mechanisms and pathways of a countrywide socioeconomic intervention, and examine the timing
of the intervention during the life course. For example, determining whether cash transfers delivered earlier in
life can contribute to better outcomes over time. This project will also investigate the cash transfer effect on
vulnerable groups (African descendants, women, and youth with lower income).
We will evaluate social drivers’ determination and the association between being beneficiaries of the Conditional
Cash Transfer program, called the Bolsa Família Program (BFP), and mental illness and its long-term effects
using robust methodologies for big datasets, such as Regression Discontinuity Designs, Propensity Score
Matching and difference-in-differences. We will test mechanisms and pathways, between BFP and mental
health-related hospitalizations and suicide among youth using Structural Equation Modeling. Furthermore, we
will perform microsimulations to generate projections regarding how mental health-related hospitalizations and
suicide trends will be in the future based on the current state, and how BFP implementation scenarios will affect
these trends.
The results of this project will be of vital importance to guide policies and programs to improve mental health and
reduce mental health-related hospitalizations and suicide in youth. It will provide information to improve the
effectiveness of these programs worldwide. Finally, it can potentially advance the global debate on the economic
response to the pandemic and times of economic crises. If cash transfers can decrease mental health problems
among youth and reduce suicide, it will have a dramatic impact on saving lives."
10738770,"The primary objective of this project is to utilize a variety of existing data sources by integrating and
analyzing them in novel ways to answer key questions related to the long-term effects of mild
traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in veterans over time. Although prior studies have found that moderate
and severe TBI are associated with a variety of adverse clinical outcomes, the effects of mTBI are
less well understood. We propose to build on our past several years of work within The Chronic
Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC - Epidemiology Study) in which we have assembled a
very large or “mega” data repository of nearly 2 million veterans (including all veterans with a TBI
diagnosis) that comprises multiple different national synthesized databases. We are extremely well
positioned to capitalize on this national resource to continue to maximally study veterans with mTBI.
Specifically, we now have the unprecedented ability to follow these veterans prospectively as they are
embedded within the VA national care system and we can investigate both the course and outcomes
of TBI. We propose to investigate mTBI and its long-term outcomes through four complementary
Specific Aims under the three Objectives of LIMBIC. In Objective 1 Aim 1 we propose to maintain,
augment, and refine our current repository, including creating and refining new variables associated
with TBI. In Objective 2 Aim 1 we will identify subgroups at the greatest risk and resilience for mental
health and neurogenerative outcomes after mTBI, including very-early onset dementia. In Objective 2
Aim 2 we propose to examine and elucidate the complex associations between mTBI and
comorbidities such as substance abuse, PTSD, etc. In Objective 3 Aim 1 we will develop prognostic
models to determine which veterans decline versus sustain/improve after mTBI. Our overall goal is to
investigate how mTBI is interwoven with other comorbidities, especially mental health factors, and
how these other factors may be synergistic or additive, how mTBI remote adverse outcomes evolve
over time and what predicts this evolution. Furthermore, we will translate our findings to develop
prognostic models that will guide clinician and researchers toward better care and prevention of mTBI
and associated outcomes."
10738774,"This is the second resubmission of a CSR&D CDA-2 proposal to provide five years of research and salary
support to Adam Gepner, MD. The CDA will prepare him to become an independent VA geriatric cardiovascular
disease investigator with clinical research expertise in geriatric cardiology, exercise physiology, arterial
pathophysiology. This application combines clearly defined training activities, continuous collaboration with a
multidisciplinary mentorship committee, and a novel research plan. Dr. Gepner proposes to non-invasively
measure acute changes in arterial stiffness parameters to identify older Veterans with greater “arterial reserve”
- the ability of the arteries to rapidly respond to changes in blood flow and pressure with stress and then rapidly
return to baseline. The central hypothesis is that arterial reserve, determined by change in arterial stiffness
measures following acute exercise or administration of sublingual nitroglycerin, will be greater in non-
hypertensives and those with controlled blood pressure than in those with poorly controlled blood pressure. His
proposal aligns with VA priorities because undertreatment of hypertension is well-recognized in the VA system.
Dr. Gepner hopes to provide new tools to personalize hypertensive care by identifying individuals that can
tolerate more aggressive blood pressure treatment goals thereby reducing adverse cardiovascular disease
(CVD) events. Resting arterial stiffness predicts future CVD events, is tightly linked with blood pressure, and
progresses most rapidly in older individuals with poorly controlled hypertension. Arterial stiffness is dynamic and
responds acutely to both exercise and administration of antihypertensive medications. The arterial response to
exercise and blood pressure medications is variable in older individuals, likely due to differences in arterial
reserve. The primary scientific objective of this CDA is to investigate acute changes in arterial stiffness
parameters with exercise and nitroglycerin administration in participants with varying degrees of blood pressure
control and those without hypertension. Three specific aims will be pursued in a prospective study of 180
ambulatory, community dwelling, Veterans ≥60 years old who will be recruited from the Care Coordination Home
Telehealth Network (CCHT) and Madison VA primary care clinics: Aims 1 and 2 are to determine if changes in
arterial stiffness parameters following 1) exercise and 2) acute blood pressure reduction with short-acting
sublingual nitroglycerin are associated with differences in baseline blood pressure control in older hypertensive
Veterans and compared to a non-hypertensive age- and sex-matched non-hypertensive control group. Aim 3 is
to determine associations between exercise capacity and changes arterial stiffness parameters among older
hypertensive Veterans to ensure that the effects of lower blood pressure do not negatively impact functional
capacity. Dr. Gepner will complete didactic training focusing on clinical trial design and conduct. He also will gain
expertise in exercise physiology, fluid dynamics and the biomechanical properties arteries. He will participate in
a structured curriculum to improve his skills as a geriatric cardiovascular specialist to improve care for older
Veterans. Dr. Gepner’s primary mentor is Dr. Cindy Carlsson, a VA clinician-investigator with expertise in
geriatrics and CVD biomarkers. Secondary mentors include Dr. Dane Cook, an exercise scientist and the Director
of the Human Exercise Lab, which will allow for hands-on training in exercise physiology; Dr. Naomi Chesler, an
expert in the mechanical aspects of arterial stiffness and Dr. Sanjay Asthana, the director of the Madison VA
GRECC. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a framework for understanding changes
in arterial stiffness in older Veterans with hypertension and allow Dr. Gepner to build his own VA laboratory to
study age-related vascular physiology. Unmasking how these changes impact antihypertensive goals and
medication tolerability are imperative in older Veterans and will provide a platform for Dr. Gepner’s next career
step, to apply for MERIT funding to test the effects of specific antihypertensive treatment intensities and to derive
novel targets for antihypertensive treatment in Veterans with difficult to control blood pressure."

 Project Summary
 Behavior in multicellular organisms is controlled by neural circuits in which neurons integrate
synaptic input and compute output. Most neurons are bipolar and comprise dendrites and axons,
which mediate reception and transmission of information, respectively. Dendrite branching is
necessary for correct circuit assembly. We are using the pair of PVD and FLP neurons in the small
nematode C. elegans to investigate basic genetic and molecular mechanisms of dendrite
development. Both PVD and FLP neurons elaborate highly branched, non-overlapping dendritic
arbors that employ conserved mechanisms during dendrite morphogenesis. Previously, we have
focused our studies on genes that are required for the formation of the dendritic arbors of PVD and
FLP neurons, with a focus on non-autonomously acting factors. In this proposal, we will focus on two
aspects that have been previously understudied, both with regard to PVD development, but also in
general with regard to dendrite patterning. In genetic screens we have identified several loci that
restrict branching. In Specific Aim 1, we will study loci we identified in genetic modifier screens of a
hypomorphic allele of the KPC-1/Furin proprotein convertase. We had previously found that KPC-
1/Furin functions cell-autonomously in PVD neurons to negatively regulate dendritic branching. This
aim is designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which KPC-1/Furin restricts branching. In
addition, we will study an allele that constitutes a mutation in a transcription factor binding site of a
gene encoding an actin regulatory protein. In Specific Aim 2, we will focus on a putative rab-related
GTPase, which we have found to function in the epidermis to restrict dendrite branching. This aim is
focused on determining the mechanisms by which this putative GTPase controls branching non-
autonomously from the skin. In addition, we will study an allele that displays the same phenotype as a
mutant in the GTPase to gain additional insight into the process of how branching is restricted.
Finally, The FLP and PVD neurons provide a unique opportunity to study the processes of heterotypic
tiling (i.e. the tiling of receptive fields between two different types of neurons) and the control of
dendritic field size in molecular detail. In a combination of forward and candidate genetic screens we
have identified a number of genes that regulate tiling between FLP and PVD dendrites. Therefore, in
Specific Aim 3, we will determine the genetic and molecular mechanisms that govern heterotypic tiling
and the control of field size. In summary, this proposal is aimed at understanding the molecular and
genetic mechanisms that restrict and control dendritic branching on the one hand and, the processes
that ensure establishment of non-overlapping dendritic fields of defined size between different types
of neurons."
10893570,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is the leading cause of liver-related mortality. How ethanol (EtOH)
damages the liver remains poorly understood, and therapies are lacking or unproven. A better understanding of
the mechanisms by which the liver handles, processes, and responds to EtOH is needed to develop strategies
to avoid and treat the dangerous hepatic ramifications of alcohol, particularly fibrosis and cirrhosis. EtOH
consumption produces a swift increase in alcohol metabolism (SIAM) that is associated with a commensurate
increase of mitochondrial respiration. Our work reveals reversible hepatic mitochondrial depolarization
(mtDepo), increased mitophagic burden, and release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in mice after EtOH
treatment, that precedes hepatic steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Here, we build on these findings to characterize
the signals, pathways, and mechanisms of 1) onset and recovery from EtOH-induced mtDepo, 2) mtDepo-
induced mitophagy, and 3) stellate cell activation and fibrosis downstream of mtDepo. Overall, we hypothesize
that mtDepo is an adaptive response stimulating more rapid mitochondrial NADH oxidation to supply
NAD+ required for EtOH metabolism, but chronically, mtDepo becomes maladaptive, causing disordered
mitophagy and release of mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs) like mtDNA,
leading ultimately to hepatic end stage liver disease. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize the mechanisms
of onset and recovery of EtOH-induced mtDepo, specifically the role of opening and closing of different proton
leak pathways in inducing mtDepo and of mitochondrial biogenesis to restore functional mitochondria after EtOH
is metabolically eliminated. In Specific Aim 2, we will characterize the manner of mitophagy after EtOH
treatment. Specifically, we will determine if mitophagy initiated by EtOH-induced mtDepo involves the classical
PINK1/Parkin ubiquitination pathway, is triggered by mitochondrial swelling leading to inner membrane herniation
through a ruptured outer membrane with release of mtDNA as observed in preliminary work, or both. In Specific
Aim 3, we will determine pathways by which mtDAMPs (like mtDNA) (possibly in synergism with acetaldehyde
generated from hepatic EtOH metabolism) elicit a profibrogenic response in stellate cells with particular
attention of the role of mtDNA-sensing toll-like receptor-9 (TLR9) whose deficiency decreases alcohol-induced
liver injury. Together, these aims will increase our understanding of mechanisms underlying both the onset
and recovery from mtDepo and how mtDepo-induced dysregulated mitophagy leads to mtDAMP release
causing stellate cell activation and ultimately hepatic fibrosis. The findings of this project will allow
development of new mechanism-based therapeutics to treat and prevent alcoholic liver disease."
10912765,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Accumulating evidence suggests that following ischemic stroke hypoperfused brain tissue is functionally disabled
as electrical communication among penumbral neurons is disrupted due to marked reductions in oxidative
metabolism. Thus, it is apparent that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in the degree of neuronal cell
death encountered following ischemic brain injury; however, mitochondria have been slow to be fully
investigated. Through a serendipitous discovery of an off-target therapeutic effect of pioglitazone, a small
mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster protein, mitoNEET (mNT) was identified that has renewed interest in therapeutic
targeting of mitochondria. MitoNEET is embedded in the outer mitochondrial membrane and acts as a redox and
pH sensor to regulate mitochondrial bioenergetics, especially in response to cellular stress. Using pioglitazone
as our parent compound, we designed NL-1, a first-in-class ligand with high specificity for mN. Using NL-1, we
have demonstrated marked improvements in stroke neuropathology and functional impairment following
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice and rats. The objective of this proposal is to address
fundamental gaps in knowledge regarding how mNT works within the brain to mitigate acute ischemic brain
injury. Our central hypothesis is that modulation of mNT acts to improve vulnerable neurons within the
penumbra by reducing the vicious cycle of excessive iron-induced lipid peroxidation and increased neuronal
death. Based on a strong body of prior literature and pilot data, we postulate the initial target of activity for NL-1
is the cerebral microvasculature; thus, we propose two specific aims to test our hypothesis. In specific aim 1,
we will test if mNT selective ligand, NL-1, mitigates ferroptosis using a 4 cell Transwell in vitro model of the blood-
brain barrier following oxygen-glucose deprivation with reperfusion. Whereas, in specific aim 2, we will test if
mNT ligand, NL-1, reduces brain iron accumulation and blood-brain barrier dysfunction post-MCAO. Successful
completion of the proposed research is expected to provide a: (1) greater understanding of how & where mNT
mitigates brain injury following ischemic stroke; (2) new insight into the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction &
diminished bioenergetics on ischemic stroke outcomes; & (3) strong scientific foundation for an interventional
therapeutic approach for treating ischemic stroke. The mechanistic & preclinical data obtained through these
studies will serve as critical milestones for advancing the development of mitochondria-targeted therapies for
treating neurological injuries & disease."
10924011,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal aims to evaluate and optimize Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) as an adjuvant treatment for
contaminated high-energy open fractures to reduce bacterial bioburden and, thus, reduce rate of infection.
Infection following fracture treatment is one of the most challenging complications facing musculoskeletal
trauma patients. Infection can be catastrophic, leading to prolonged morbidity, loss of function, and potential
loss of limb. Several factors make high-energy open trauma particularly susceptible to infection: the presence
of traumatized tissues, contamination of the fracture, poor soft tissue coverage, poor nutritional state due to
polytrauma, prolonged hospitalization with exposure to nosocomial bacteria, and presence of metallic implants.
Infection prevention strategies currently employed include systemic antibiotics, thorough surgical debridement
of open fracture, local antibiotics, mechanical stability of the extremity with metallic implants as well as soft
tissue coverage. However, despite these prevention strategies, infection occurs in 10-60% of open fractures.
This is due, at least in part, to inadequate eradication of contaminating bacteria, particularly in the context of
hardware at the fracture site. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of PDT at
reducing wound bioburden in contaminated high-energy open fracture, thus reducing the risk of fracture related
infection in preparation for translation into human patients. The scientific premise of this proposal is
underpinned by data from our prior in vitro studies demonstrating enormous efficacy, killing >90% of bacteria in
mature established biofilm, which is far superior to currently utilized adjuvant treatment, and our in vivo studies
showing eradication of MRSA from contaminated open fracture. To attain our overall objective, three aims will
be pursued. In Aim 1 we will optimize the formulation, light dose, and timing of PDT; in Aim 2 we will determine
the efficacy of adjuvant topical PDT on two different fixation strategies, which have different consequences in
terms of biofilm formation (intramedullary fixation and plate fixation); in Aim 3 we will develop and preliminarily
assess the efficacy of repeat PDT administration through a surgically placed extraosseous catheter.
Integration of PDT into treatment of high-risk contaminated high-energy open fractures has the potential to
revolutionize treatment of these injuries, resulting in a reduction in wound bioburden and, thus, a reduction in
risk of infection. This project leverages an extensive infrastructure and experience in fluorescence-guided
surgery as well as longstanding collaborations between orthopaedic surgery and biomedical engineers."

estimates with spatiotemporally complete coverage to characterize the effects of wildfire PM2.5 exposure on
individuals with or at risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), a large
population extremely vulnerable to natural disasters, including wildfire smoke. Under the mentorship of Dr. Joel
Kaufman, this training and research plan will build upon Dr. Bi’s expertise in air pollution exposure and
epidemiology and prepare him for a career studying advanced analytic methods to understand environmental
exposures and their application in epidemiologic research. During the K99 phase, Dr. Bi will use didactic
instruction and independent study to gain additional training in 1) advanced data analysis and statistical methods
for “big data”, 2) analysis of PM2.5 speciation related to wildfire smoke, 3) epidemiologic analysis for long-term
air pollution exposure, 4) nephrotoxicity and mechanisms of PM2.5, and 5) electronic health data processing. This
training will provide Dr. Bi with interdisciplinary skills and knowledge as he moves toward an independent
research career in advanced environmental exposure and epidemiologic analyses. Dr. Bi’s research in the K99
phase aims to 1) develop innovative statistical prediction models to accurately separate wildfire PM2.5 from total
PM2.5 and 2) incorporate novel quantitative satellite and dense low-cost monitoring data into wildfire PM2.5
prediction. Dr. Bi’s wildfire PM2.5 models will require substantially fewer computational resources than chemical
transport models (CTMs), while producing exposure estimates expected to be more accurate than the estimates
derived by CTM and current statistical methods. During the R00 phase, Dr. Bi’s research focuses on assessing
1) chronic effects of multi-year wildfire PM2.5 exposure on individuals with or at risk of CKD and 2) acute effects
of multi-day wildfire PM2.5 exposure on ESKD patients receiving in-center hemodialysis (HD). His epidemiologic
analyses will rely on the Center for Kidney Disease Research, Education and Hope (CURE-CKD) registry with
individuals from inpatient, outpatient, and ambulatory settings following strict guideline-based CKD or at risk of
CKD criteria in the western U.S., and the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) with patient-level
demographics and dialysis/medical/mortality records on nearly all U.S. patients with ESKD receiving HD (with a
focus on the western U.S.). The R00 phase also examines effect modification by key variables and differences
in toxicity between wildfire and non-wildfire PM2.5. Dr. Bi’s epidemiologic studies will allow crucial new insights
into the concentration-response relationships between wildfire PM2.5 exposure and its effects on the vulnerable
kidney disease population. Better understanding the health impacts of wildfire smoke will facilitate more effective
smoke management decisions and policies, and in turn reduce the associated substantial health costs."
10727822,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opinion-based clinical practice guidelines for management of hyperphosphatemia recommend lowering serum phosphate towards normal in order to improve on the dismal clinical outcomes of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, no randomized clinical trial tested whether phosphate reduction improves clinical outcomes or whether it might provoke unexpected harm. These gaps provided the equipoise needed to initiate “HiLo” as an NIH Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory pragmatic clinical trial in partnership with DaVita. HiLo is testing the hypothesis that targeting a higher serum phosphate (“Hi,” ≥6.5 mg/dl) vs a lower serum phosphate (“Lo,” <5.5 mg/dl) will be superior on the primary hierarchical composite outcome of all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalization. We initially designed HiLo as a cluster-randomized trial in which entire dialysis units were randomized. Upon review of 434 of the first 558 participants who entered the cluster-randomized trial through 2021, we identified imbalances in baseline characteristics and enrollment rates between the Hi and Lo arms. These findings raised concern that biased recruitment due to post-randomization consent could jeopardize internal validity. In response, we worked with the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and DaVita to redesign HiLo as an individual-randomized trial. We resumed recruitment in 2022. The HiLo study team was informed on Friday, November 17, 2023 that the DSMB and NIDDK made the decision to terminate the study due to futility of enrollment and futility of separation between the invention and control arm participants’ mean serum phosphate levels. In this closeout award, we will separately analyze the cluster-randomized and individually-randomized participants and also perform an additional analysis in which the individually-randomized participants are considered a cluster of their own and combined with the other cluster-randomized participants in a single analysis. We will report these results as part of a final manuscript that details the closure of HiLo and conveys lessons learned for PCTs in ESKD."

 This new investigator proposal describes a five-year training program for the development of a physician-
scientist career studying traumatic brain injury (TBI). This investigator completed a Ph.D. in neurobiology
focused on mechanisms and neuroinflammatory responses to diffuse axonal injury (DAI). This investigator
completed neurosurgery residency, two fellowships in pediatric neurosurgery and pediatric spinal deformity,
and is currently a Clinical Instructor at the University of Pennsylvania. In carrying out the proposed research,
the principle investigator will acquire expertise in protein biochemistry, knockout genomics, behavioral studies,
and advanced neuroimaging techniques. Dr. Douglas Smith, Professor and Chair of Research in the
Department of Neurosurgery, will mentor the principle investigator's scientific development. An advisory
committee of outstanding, nationally recognized scientists will provide scientific and career advice. The
Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania is committed to providing an ideal setting and
resources to ensure the principle investigator's success. The research proposal and environment will allow the
principle investigator to develop an academic career and become a leader in the neurotrauma community.
 Research will focus on the selective vulnerability of unmyelinated axon segments to initiating mechanisms
of diffuse TBI as well as treatment strategies to overcome DAI pathobiology. DAI pathogenesis proceeds
through a cascade of events leading to delayed or secondary axotomy. This creates a therapeutic window
during which treatments may mitigate or prevent axon disconnection. Mechanisms of DAI cytoskeletal injury
remain poorly understood and there are no treatments. The proposal seeks to determine precise DAI initiating
loci, explain the cytoskeletal protein spectrin's role in axonal injury, and investigate two neuroprotective
paradigms to mitigate DAI pathobiology. Using an experimental diffuse TBI murine model, the Specific Aims
include: 1.) Determine if the axon initial segment and/or nodes of Ranvier are sites of secondary axotomy
following diffuse TBI and 2.) Determine spectrin-mediated contributions to secondary axotomy following diffuse
TBI. This proposal will be the first to test the hypothesis that disruption of the spectrin cytosketeton at excitable
domains along the axon serves as a nidus for injury. Neuroprotective paradigms include preservation of the
spectrin cytoskeleton through exogenous and endogenous inhibition of the protease calpain, which targets
spectrin for degradation. The proposed research will improve our understanding of DAI-mediated cytoskeletal
injury and test neuroprotective strategies designed to prevent secondary axotomy. The integration of histology,
behavioral outcomes, and advanced neuroimaging techniques will create a model that predicts injury severity
and prognosticates recovery after diffuse brain injury."
10912050,"Degenerative aortic stenosis is a progressive valvular heart disease affecting the aging population and when
hemodynamically significant is associated with serious adverse outcomes, such as heart failure, syncope, and
death. Although, symptomatic classical severe aortic stenosis (AS), wherein aortic valve anatomical or effective
area is ≤ 1.0 𝑐𝑚2 and mean gradient ≥ 40 mmHg raises no diagnostic dilemma, patients with low gradient aortic
stenosis (i.e., mean gradient < 40 mmHg) that may be severe (i.e., aortic valve area ≤ 1.0 𝑐𝑚2) remain a
challenge for determining the true severity of aortic stenosis and present a significant unmet clinical need. The
discordance between aortic valve area of ≤ 1.0 𝑐𝑚2 and mean gradient < 40 mmHg is encountered in as many
as 30 to 40% of patients with aortic valve area ≤ 1.0 𝑐𝑚2 by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). In patients
with these discordant findings, the true severity is uncertain and have led to the use of dobutamine stress
echocardiography (DSE). Based on DSE, one can classify the potentially severe low-gradient subjects into 4
distinct subgroups a) Low gradient severe aortic stenosis (LGS): aortic valve area of ≤ 1.0 𝑐𝑚2 and a mean
gradient of ≥ 40 mmHg with DSE. b) Low gradient pseudo-severe aortic stenosis (LGPS): aortic valve area of >
1.0 𝑐𝑚2 and a mean gradient of < 40 mmHg with DSE. c) Low gradient indeterminate aortic stenosis severity
(LGI): aortic valve area of ≤ 1.0 𝑐𝑚2 and a mean gradient of < 40 mmHg with DSE. d) Finally, aortic valve area
of > 1.0 𝑐𝑚2 and a mean gradient of ≥ 40 mmHg with DSE are classified as moderate or less severe aortic
stenosis (LSA). Nearly one-third of patients classified as LGS are classified as LGPS with DSE (6). Further,
compounding the concern in patients classified as LGPS, LGI, LSA is that they often manifest with symptoms
potentially attributable to severe AS suggesting an initial misclassification perhaps due to measurement errors.
Compared to echo, with MRI, the velocities can be measured in all 3D directions and due to its tomographic
nature, no geometric assumptions are required. The hypothesis of the study is that our planned CMR methods
which we will develop based on previous work will be able to better stratify these AS subjects. Our specific aims
are: 1) We will develop efficient rest and dobutamine stress 4D Spiral flow imaging protocols based on k-space
dependent respiratory gating. 2) We have recently developed a Deep Learning framework which based on
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of training data learns to directly map velocities to pressures.
This will be adapted to measure the transvalvular pressure gradients (TVPG) in human subjects and validated.
3) In 40 subjects with potentially severe low gradient AS (10 in each of the LGS, LGPS, LGI, LSA), a TTE study,
and a CMR study will be performed both at rest and under dobutamine stress. To validate, TVPG will be
measured with cath in a group with n=10 of moderate AS (MAS) subjects undergoing cath for other purposes.
This group will also undergo TTE and CMR studies. Subjects with severe AS were not selected for cath for safety
reasons. Classification across modalities, flow, velocity, pressure, and orifice area will be statistically correlated."
10735954,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this project is to model human joint biomechanics over continuously-varying locomotion to
enable adaptive control of powered above-knee prostheses. Above-knee amputees often struggle to perform the
varying activities of daily life with conventional prostheses due to the lack of positive mechanical work and active
control. Emerging powered prostheses have motors that can perform these missing functions, but the
biomechanics experienced by the user depend on the control of these motors. The way the prosthesis interacts
with both the user and environment can be controlled through joint impedance—the relationship between joint
motion and torque. Prosthetic joint impedance is typically defined via a stiffness, viscosity, and equilibrium angle
for discrete phases of gait within a limited set of discrete activities, but this framework does not allow continuous
variations of steady-state activities (e.g., walking at different speeds/inclines) or continuous transitions between
activities (e.g., walk to stair ascent). The central hypothesis of this project is that variable joint impedance can
be parameterized by a continuous model based on measurable quantities called phase and task variables. This
project will use machine learning to identify variable impedance functions from able-bodied data including joint
perturbation responses across the phase/task space to bias the solution toward biological values. The resulting
impedance model will be used with real-time estimates of phase and task variables to control a custom powered
knee-ankle prosthesis and the Össur PowerKnee across activities. The specific aims are as follows:
Aim 1: Model and control joint impedance over continuums of steady-state activities.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that knee and ankle impedance during walking and stair climbing can be modeled
and controlled as continuous functions of gait phase, speed, and terrain inclination.
Aim 2: Model and control joint impedance over continuous transitions between activities.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that knee and ankle impedance during continuous transitions between sitting,
standing, walking, and stair climbing can be modeled and controlled as functions of transitional task variables.
Aim 3: Implement continuous impedance controller and clinician interface on commercial hardware.
Hypothesis: The impedance control system implemented on the Össur PowerKnee with a partially-automated
tuning process will improve amputee endurance and symmetry over activities of daily life.
 This project will be scientifically significant to understanding how human joint mechanics continuously
adapt to varying tasks and terrains, technologically significant to designing agile, biomimetic powered prosthetic
legs for community ambulation, and clinically significant to the widespread adoption of intuitive powered
prostheses for improved patient outcomes. The adaptability and clinical viability of this control paradigm will
have a profound impact on mobility and quality of life for nearly a million Americans with lower-limb loss."
10851785,"Abstract
 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading chronic disease worldwide, causing significant
healthcare utilization, morbidity, and mortality. Irreversible airflow obstruction alone can establish the diagnosis
of COPD. However, a diagnosis of COPD includes a heterogeneous collection of lung diseases. This proposal
will focus on one form of COPD, emphysema (EM). Past studies suggest that sex may significantly impact the
EM severity. However, we do not have a clear mechanistic understanding of how sexual dimorphism drives
smokers’ lung tissue injury toward or award from EM. Our preliminary studies identified a gene module from
Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) that highly correlated with emphysematous tissue
remodeling related to sex differences. These Green module genes were significantly expressed in monocyte
lineage cells. Sex differences significantly correlate with changes in monocyte/macrophage clusters of the lung
tissue single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). In a preliminary study collaborating with the Multi-Ethnic Study
of Atherosclerosis (MESA), we concluded that emphysema severity in 1,346 subjects’ chest CT was significantly
worse in male smokers than in female smokers. These completed studies led us to hypothesize that sex
differences cause greater susceptibility for males to develop emphysematous lung injury during chronic cigarette
smoke exposure by altering the monocyte clusters enriched with the Green module genes. The primary goal of
this study is to identify sex-dependent biomolecular factors that drive the divergent changes in monocyte-lineage
cells during emphysematous pulmonary tissue injury. We will also determine how these changes in monocyte-
lineage cells cause pathology in lung structures (epithelium and endothelium). To achieve these goals, we
propose three aims. (1). Aim 1 - Determine monocyte-lineage cells’ composition, differentiation, functions, and
their downstream effects on the alveolar epithelium and endothelium, using the “Green” module as a target gene
set in the C57B/6 murine model over chronic cigarette smoke exposure with gain or loss of female or male
gonadal functions. (2). Aim 2 - Determine the correlation between monocyte-lineage cells’ composition in lung
scRNA-seq and emphysema severity by chest CT from UVa cohorts balanced in sex and presence or absence
of COPD (n=60) using the “Green” module as a target gene set. (3). Aim 3 - Test the Green module as a
longitudinal mediator of sexual dimorphism during the evolution of emphysema from longitudinal MESA Exams
5 to Exam 6. Emphysema is mainly resistant to all available therapies except lung volume reduction strategy and
lung transplant. To date, little is known about the functions of monocytes at the level of single cells in the lungs
undergoing emphysematous damage. Therefore, our proposal can provide critical biomolecular information
between females and males to assess the risk, identify the dysregulated processes, and help develop strategies
to mitigate and treat emphysematous COPD tailored by sexual dimorphism and monocyte biology."
10909270,"Project Summary
One in 10 critically ill children in the ICU requires tracheal intubation (TI). TIs are hazard-prone procedures
given that critically ill children who require TI often have limited oxygen reserve, challenging anatomy, and
life-threatening hemodynamic instability. They are at the highest risk for Adverse Airway Outcomes [AAO]:
Tracheal Intubation Associated Events (TIAE) and/or severe oxygen desaturation. Since 2010, the National
Emergency Airway Registry for Children (NEAR4KIDS) collaborative led by our team has demonstrated that
children with AAO had significantly longer mechanical ventilation duration, longer ICU stays, and higher
mortality. Our pediatric ICU Airway Bundle with bedside checklist reduced the AAO. However, substantial
room for improvement still exists. In 2019, across 54 NEAR4KIDS pediatric ICUs, 24% of critically ill children
requiring TI still experienced AAOs. To substantially improve the safety of high-risk TI for critically ill children,
it is essential to facilitate bedside team performance with optimal technology and a human factors approach.
Our overarching goal is to transform the safety and quality of TI in critically ill children across diverse pediatric
ICUs. We will achieve this goal by implementing a digitalized Smart Checklist that has three specific features:
prompts based on patient characteristics, direct display of difficult airway status and airway information from
the electronic health record, and high-risk warning based on predictive analytics. We will characterize the
impact of the intervention on work processes and systems (i.e., flow disruptions, workflow integration,
teamwork, team leader’s cognitive taskload) to determine explanatory factors for the clinical impact (i.e., to
understand how and why). We will implement a digitalized Smart Checklist across 6 Pediatric ICUs within
NEAR4KIDS using a cluster-randomized design. Smart Checklist upgrades will take place over 12 months and
will include digital conversion, the introduction of prompts, full EHR-integrated airway history display, and
risk calculation. Our team of investigators includes an experienced EHR clinical decision support programmer
for multicenter use with a robust track record of success. We developed a clear implementation plan. We will
test the hypothesis: Smart Checklist implementation will reduce the occurrence of AAO by 27% (relative risk
reduction, 6% absolute). In Aim 2, we will determine how and why the Smart Checklist implementation
reduces the AAO at each ICU using an established human factors approach. Our findings will be widely
applicable in any procedural safety with various provider skill levels, especially when and where the procedural
risk is high."
10740844,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The strength of an immune response against a transplanted organ, termed the alloresponse, depends
on the extent of genetic differences between the donor and the recipient and their recognition by the recipient’s
immune system. Our studies from the previous funding cycle have shown that the microbiota, the collection of
microbes that colonize the body and differ between individuals, is an additional novel factor that can causally
modulate the intensity and kinetics of the alloresponse to a transplanted organ. Unlike donor and host genetics,
the microbiota can be manipulated therapeutically, thus providing possible new interventions to protect the graft
and help reduce the need for immunosuppressive drugs that can cause significant side effects.
 We initially considered the body’s microbiota as a whole and demonstrated that a reduction in microbial
diversity induced by broad-spectrum antibiotic (Abx) pre-treatment, or an absence of microbiota using germ-free
(GF) mice, both improved minor mismatched skin graft survival. Fecal microbiome transfer (FMT) from control,
but not Abx-pre-treated mice, into GF mice was sufficient to accelerate skin graft rejection. This demonstrated
both the causality of the microbiota on affecting graft outcome, and the divergent effects of distinct fecal microbial
communities. Abx pre-treatment also delayed rejection of fully mismatched skin grafts, minor mismatched lung
grafts, and MHC class II-mismatched heart grafts, indicating that whole-body microbiota affects the outcome of
both colonized and sterile organs. We further showed that that some microbial communities could be dominantly
protective of rejection. This protection was associated with fecal presence of bacteria of the genus Alistipes.
 In addition, the half-life of small bowel, lung and skin transplants is much shorter than that of heart and
kidney grafts, supporting the hypothesis that the commensals in the graft may also be able to influence
alloimmunity. Our recent preliminary experiments demonstrate that colonization of donor skin with the single
commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epi), in the absence of intestinal colonization of the host, can be
sufficient to accelerate skin graft rejection. This result clearly demonstrates that microbiota within the allograft
also impacts graft outcome. Notably, the mechanism by which skin S. epi accelerates skin graft rejection appears
different from how whole-body microbiota in SPF mice or FMT into GF mice accelerates skin graft rejection. We
hypothesize a novel paradigm that the recipient gut microbiota affects immune responses in the whole animal
by systemically modulating DCs up or down, whereas the microbiota in the donor graft locally affects the effector
phase of the alloresponse upon migration of recipient alloreative T cells into the graft. Using a combination of
TCR transgenic T cells and p:MHC multimers to track anti-commensal and anti-donor immune responses in
parallel, as well as select bacterial colonization of distinct tissues in gnotobiotic mice, we will: 1. Investigate the
mechanisms by which gut-only microbes can impact skin graft rejection distally; 2. Define the
mechanisms by which skin-only commensals locally accelerate skin graft rejection."
10740846,"Project Summary: Mitotic cells assemble two key cellular structures to segregate the chromosomes equally
between the two daughter cells - the mitotic spindle and the kinetochores. Kinetochores are multi-protein
complexes that form at the centromeres of the chromosomes during mitosis and serve as attachment sites for
microtubules [MT(s)] of the mitotic spindle. The kinetochore-microtubule (kMT) interface generates force that
drives chromosome alignment and segregation. The current focus of the Varma lab is on understanding the
molecular mechanisms involved in kMT attachments and their contribution to accurate chromosome segregation.
During early mitotic prometaphase, kinetochores initially attach to the MT lattice laterally. These lateral
attachments are subsequently converted into end-on attachments when sister kinetochores become stably
attached to the plus-ends of spindle MTs in metaphase. Studies have shown that the initial capture and lateral
sliding of kinetochores on MTs is driven by dynein, a minus-end-directed motor. The end-on kinetochore-
microtubule (kMT) attachment formation and its stabilization is mediated by the MT-binding kinetochore complex,
Ndc80. Our 1st major goal is to determine how the kinetochore complexes required for these two alternate
modes of MT attachment coordinate to produce dynamic kMT attachments required for proper
chromosome alignment. Our recent work has provided evidence for an antagonistic relationship between
dynein and the Ndc80 complexes in humans during mitosis. Our unpublished results suggest that dynein and
the Ndc80 complex synergize for efficient chromosome capture and for stabilizing kMT attachments during
metaphase, but the mechanism for this coordination is unclear.
 The centromere-distal region of the Ndc80 complex at the N-terminal domain of the Hec1 subunit has
been identified as the MT-binding site required to stabilize kMT attachments. Phosphorylation of this region by
Aurora B kinase negatively regulates the strength of kMT attachments. Our work has discovered that in addition
to the N-terminal domain, the more internal loop domain has a major role in attachment. The attachment
requires the loop domain-mediated kinetochore recruitment of the replication licensing protein Cdt1, which we
find is a novel MT-binding protein at kinetochores. Our work also demonstrates that the binding of Cdt1 to MTs
is negatively regulated by Aurora B. Our unpublished studies demonstrate that Cdt1 synergizes with another
MT-associated protein (MAP) at kinetochores, the Ska complex that has been shown to promote efficient binding
of the Ndc80 complex to kMTs. Our 2nd major goal is to determine how different kinetochore MAPs mediate
robust interaction between the Ndc80 complex and MTs for the stabilization of kMT attachments during
metaphase to drive accurate chromosome segregation. In the long term, our lab aims to identify novel
mechanisms controlling kMT attachments and the pathways that regulate this process, while also establishing
novel model systems and approaches to study these processes."
10741690,"Impairments in executive function are among the most devastating consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure
(PAE), for which there are few effective treatments. Our long-term goal is to identify key neural mechanisms
underlying these impairments, to facilitate the development of circuit-specific treatments for Fetal Alcohol
Spectrum Disorders (FASDs). Our objective is to leverage in vivo behavioral electrophysiology to determine
the impact of PAE on corticothalamic functional coupling, and its relationship to visuospatial working memory,
rule learning/switching, myelination and CircRNA/Neuroimmune signaling. Our central hypothesis is that PAE
induces alterations in the functional connectivity of reciprocal circuits connecting the mediodorsal thalamic
nuclei and the medial prefrontal cortex (MD↔mPFC), which underlie deficits in working memory and cognitive
flexibility in FASD, and which are mediated by decreased MD↔mPFC myelination and associated with
transcriptional blood biomarkers. Our rationale for the use of in vivo behavioral electrophysiology during the
resting-state as well as during visuospatial rule learning/switching is to provide a comprehensive view of the
effects of PAE on functional MD↔mPFC connectivity and its impact on behavior. In Aim 1, we will use dual site
high-density silicon electrode recordings in freely behaving mice in the home cage to detect and characterize
resting state functional connectivity to test the hypothesis that developmental ethanol exposure reduces
resting-state neural oscillations associated with cognitive abilities, increases resting-state spiking activity within
MD/mPFC microcircuits, and decreases resting-state MD↔mPFC spike-field coherence. In Aim 2, we will
determine the effects of PAE on MD↔mPFC function during visuospatial learning/performance and a rule
switch to test the hypothesis that PAE disrupts visuospatial working memory and cognitive flexibility within
local MD/mPFC microcircuits. We will also use spike/field coherence and phase/amplitude coupling to test the
hypothesis that PAE reduces the functional integration of MD-encoded task-relevant information to the mPFC,
and vice versa. In Aim 3, we will determine the effects of PAE on the relationship between resting state
MD↔mPFC electrophysiology, and visuospatial learning/flexibility, task-based neuronal tuning, white matter
integrity, and circRNA/neuroimmune status. These comparisons will collectively test the hypothesis that
resting state corticothalamic function predicts (or is predicted by) behavioral performance, neuronal tuning to
cues/delays/behavior, and white matter integrity and circRNA/neuroimmune status. The research proposed in
this application is innovative because it will systematically characterize, for the first time, the developmental
effects of ethanol on interactions among key components of the cognitive thalamus essential in executive
functioning. The proposed research is significant because it will elucidate novel functional neurobiological
mechanisms underlying developmental ethanol exposure-induced cognitive and executive function deficits,
and identify specific biological targets for interventions to ameliorate these deficits."
10741691,"Animal and clinical studies support the biological vulnerability to chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases
in FASD populations is driven by dysfunctional CNS-immune interactions, which include signaling and
transcriptional regulatory factors often engaged following toll-like 4 (TLR4) immune receptor activation, and may
underlie cognitive deficits precipitated by typical stressors; a secondary insult or “second hit”. Frequently, these
problems do not manifest until adolescence or early adulthood. One potential mechanism driving CNS immune
dysfunction as a consequence of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) (“first hit”) may involve circular RNAs
(circRNAs), which are brain-enriched non-coding RNAs capable of acting as diverse regulators of gene
expression and immune function via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. We recently
published that a subset of circRNAs is dysregulated in the prenatal brain as a result of PAE. Preliminary data
show dysregulated circRNAs from PAE in rodent blood and spinal cord, and sex differences were present
between elevated proinflammatory immune factors in the rodent female amygdala when stimulated by a “second
minor hit”, an acute stressor, with PAE. These immune factors overlap with the intracellular TLR4 activation
pathway thus narrowing the breadth of immune factors that may be dysregulated by PAE following a secondary
challenge. Leveraging clinical data from adolescent children with an FASD (Component 3; current Phase III
P50) who are evaluated for cognitive regulation, the goals of Component 5 is to evaluate and correlate the impact
of PAE on the expression of a subset of circRNAs, and associated mRNAs and proteins from (1) adolescent
mouse blood and brain regions that support cognitive function involving working memory following minor
challenges, and (2) saliva and blood of adolescent children with an FASD undergoing specific cognitive tasks.
The overarching hypothesis of Component 5 is that a subset of circRNAs is dysregulated by PAE, creating
brain immune sensitization that: 1) is necessary and sufficient for cognitive deficits precipitated by minor
challenges in adolescent mice, and (2) predicts cognitive deficits and stress perception in human adolescents
with FASD. Sex differences are integrated into the three Aims proposed to test this hypothesis. Component 5 of
Phase III will complement other research components by evaluating middle adolescent cognitive function of
mouse offspring with PAE using age-appropriate cognitive tests, which may predict and complement cognitive
deficits that develop in young adulthood, as assessed by other components of Phase III. CircRNA, mRNA and
protein analyses from Component-3 adolescent mice can be correlated with measured neuroimmune factors
from brains of behaviorally validated young adult mice from other components. Newly identified circRNAs that
regulate associated mRNA/protein immune factors will be correlated with Component 3’s clinical study of
cognitive function in human adolescents. CircRNA biomarkers for FASD populations may emerge. Results may
identify novel targets to mitigate the risk of neuroimmune and cognitive dysfunction in individuals with FASD."
10741692,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During development, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) widely dispersed into surrounding areas of gray
matter (neuronal cell bodies) or white matter (axon fiber tracts). As development proceeds into postnatal stages,
OPCs readily differentiate to give rise to oligodendrocytes, which are responsible for insulating neuronal axons
with myelin sheath. Interestingly, many OPCs remain undifferentiated into adult stages where they have been
shown to play an important role in adaptive myelination, a neuronal activity driven, experience-mediated process
that is essential for various forms of learning and memory. Previous studies show that OPCs are vulnerable to
the effects of developmental alcohol exposure, resulting in a decrease or delay in differentiation and myelination
of major white matter tracts in the brain. It is possible that these myelination deficits, especially in brain regions
critical for learning and memory, may directly contribute to the neurodevelopmental and behavioral abnormalities
observed in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). However, how developmental alcohol
exposure impacts the gene expression and function of OPCs and oligodendrocytes, and their roles in myelin
plasticity during learning and memory remains to be elucidated. To bridge this gap in knowledge, this component
aims to pursue the following specific aims in a third trimester equivalent mouse model of alcohol exposure (TTAE)
in which oligodendrogenesis and myelination are compromised in the brain.
Specific Aim 1. To determine the effects of developmental alcohol exposure on transcriptional programs
essential for differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes in gray matter and white matter in the brain.
Specific Aim 2. To determine the impact of developmental alcohol exposure on activity-dependent, experience-
mediated myelin plasticity in early adulthood.
We anticipate that the completion of these aims will provide important clinical implications regarding strategies
to pharmacologically stimulate the myelination capacity of OPCs and oligodendrocytes to reverse the myelination
deficits seen in those affected by FASD."

cross-disciplinary FASD research across campus and promote growth of the Center. The Core will provide a
critical opportunity to develop new basic, translational and clinical fetal alcohol research projects that
complement and broaden the NMARC's research program portfolio. Selected projects must fit within the
context of the Center’s three strategic objectives as well as build on the overall integration and sustainability of
the Center’s research activities. Pilot projects will be funded for up to 2 years. The goal of each pilot project is
to obtain sufficient preliminary data to develop competitive research grant applications and cultivate new
investigators that will form part of the center. Support from the NMARC Pilot Project Core has played a crucial
role in the success of R21 and/or R01 applications submitted by center investigators. Importantly, our Pilot
Project Core has opened new and important research areas in the FASD field (e.g., impact of prenatal alcohol
exposure (PAE) on place cell, grid cell, and head direction cell function; effect of PAE on pain processing;
interaction between placental dysfunction and PAE) and has brought novel approaches into the field (e.g.,
applied behavioral analysis in FASD management; circular RNA studies). The Core will primarily support new
investigators that have yet to obtain substantial independent research support. A year prior to the end of the
Pilot Projects that are initially funded, a call for additional Pilot Project proposals will be widely advertised within
the scientific community at UNM, the Mind Research Network, and neighboring institutions. Each project will
have an Advisory Team composed of senior alcohol researchers with complementary scientific expertise to
that of the pilot project PI. The Center Director and NMARC Steering Committee will monitor progress of all
pilot projects. Pilot project progress will be reviewed bi-annually by the NMARC Steering Committee and
annually by the Program Advisory Committee. The Pilot Project Core goals have been successfully
accomplished during the first 3½ years of Phase II of the NMARC P50 award. We recruited several new
investigators from diverse fields into the FASD research field. Two R21 and one R01 grants were obtained
using preliminary data collected under the support of the Pilot Project Core. Support was preferentially
provided to junior faculty members. The Pilot Project Core will support two projects during the first two years.
Project 7A will investigate the effects of PAE on intracranial self-stimulation in adolescent mice. (P.I. Amanda

a number that rises to 80% among infants. The safe and effective prescribing of medications is essential to
providing the highest quality care, and yet many children are receiving medications that have not been
evaluated in their age group or in their disease area by rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There is a
tremendous amount of data collected in the routine clinical care of patients via electronic health records
(EHRs), claims data, and patient-reported data. These “real-world data” (RWD) can be harnessed with
advanced epidemiologic methods focused on causal inference to generate “real-world evidence” (RWE) of
medication safety and effectiveness. RWE studies, if conducted with scientific rigor, have the potential to
complement RCTs and address important evidence gaps in the use of medications in children.
 This project aims to develop a framework for the rigorous conduct of RWE studies of pediatric
medication use through the following specific aims: (1) to emulate 10 RCTs of medication effects in children
using routinely collected healthcare data, (2) to evaluate alternative approaches to minimize bias when
emulating RCTs in pediatric populations, and (3) to conduct 3 pediatric RWE studies on medication effects in
clinical areas that lack RCT evidence. We will use RCTs as our gold-standard and use advanced causal
inference and pharmacoepidemiology methods to design RWE studies to emulate published RCTs as closely
as possible. Ten model RCTs will provide the scaffold for the evaluation of which methods perform best for the
emulation of RCTs using RWE, and under which conditions. We will identify and summarize the methods that
lead to the most successful emulation of RCTs. We will use best practice approaches to conduct three novel
RWE studies. We will use three large healthcare utilization databases, including publicly and commercially
insured children, as sources of RWD to conduct the RWE studies. These databases have detailed diagnostic
and prescription information, making them well suited to studying medication use in children.
 The Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital
provides the ideal setting for this endeavor. I will work with a team of mentors with expertise in
pharmacoepidemiology, causal inference, comparative safety and effectiveness, pharmacology, and pediatric
research to successfully complete the proposed project. This project provides the ideal framework to develop
expertise in advanced pharmacoepidemiology and causal inference methods and support the overarching goal
of my research: to generate high-quality evidence of medication safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients
when no RCT data is available. Hands-on training and direct mentorship will be complemented by coursework
at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. This endeavor will provide the necessary foundation for me
to become an independent investigator in pediatric pharmacoepidemiology."
10895581,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Scientific research can benefit from healthy self-examination and agile, data-driven corrections. The
“Reproducibility Crisis” has necessitated structural changes amongst publishers and funders, but individual
scientists have not received the level of training necessary to fix common issues in rigor and inadequacies in
transparent reporting that contribute to replication problems. While the crisis has prompted numerous workshops,
opinion pieces, and quantified replication evaluations in neuroscience, the development of cohesive and high
impact training opportunities has not yet occurred. The inaccessibility of training modules makes it difficult to
formally train scientists whether they are beginners (e.g., undergraduate students) or seasoned researchers
(e.g., tenured professors) without an unrealistic individual time commitment from the scientists themselves. The
development of stand-alone educational units covering issues of the scientific process from the philosophical
foundations of science all the way to the reporting of data and methods in a transparent manner are critical to
making this training both accessible and acceptable to researchers. At the University of Texas at Dallas, we have
assembled a team of stakeholders and supporters with rich backgrounds in basic neuroscience research,
psychology research and clinical practice, education curricula development, pedagogy research, and the
reproducibility crisis itself to build three high impact educational units that will be integrated into the digital
platform developed by the Creating an Educational Nexus for Training in Experimental Rigor (CENTER) group.
Our focus is on three critical and practical areas of the crisis: (1) Recording of data and methods (2) Exploratory
vs confirmatory research, and (3) Interpreting and reporting findings."
10876315,"Abstract. The WHO estimates that 25% of the world’s population has been infected with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium that causes the disease tuberculosis (TB). Despite major advances in the
field, how T cells and macrophages collaborate to control intracellular infection is incompletely defined.
Alveolar macrophages are the first cell that Mtb infects but ultimately, CD11c+ monocyte-derived macrophages
(MDM) become the major infected cell type. Our studies show that Mtb-infected CD11c+ MDM cells can be
distinguished from uninfected bystander macrophages by their expression of cell surface CD38, CD14,
ABCA1. CD38 is also expressed by activated T cells. Peripheral blood and lung CD4 T cells from people with
TB also express CD38, which has been proposed as a biomarker to distinguish active TB from latent TB, and
to monitor treatment. While these data establish CD38 as an interesting cellular marker, its known biological
functions suggested that it could have an important role in immunity to TB. CD38 is a multifunctional
ectoenzyme that converts NAD+ to NAADP or cADPR. These second messengers trigger intracellular Ca2+
release, which promotes phagocytosis and phagolysosome formation in macrophages. Our preliminary studies
show that CD38 knockout (CD38KO) mice have higher Mtb burdens in the lung and significantly reduced
survival, compared to CD38-sufficient mice. How CD38 promotes resistance to Mtb is unknown. This proposal
will identify the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) by which CD38 contributes to protection against Mtb. We
propose three aims: 1) Determine the cellular basis for how CD38 contributes to anti-Mtb immunity in vivo; 2)
Investigate how CD38 affects intracellular survival of Mtb within macrophages; and 3) Assess how CD38
signaling affects control of intracellular Mtb in human macrophages. Our goal is to define the basic cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which CD38 promotes antimycobacterial immunity. We suggest that CD38 converts
T cell signals into a macrophage antibacterial defense program. Our proposed in vivo studies using the murine
TB model, and in vitro studies using murine and human macrophages, will establish how CD38 functions to
enhance immunity to TB and provide a strong foundation for further investigations. As well-defined agonists
and antagonists exist for CD38, and it is already a therapeutic target for other diseases, an improved
understanding of how CD38 modulates immunity against Mtb infection could identify it as a novel HDT target
for TB and other infectious diseases."
10884351,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Inflammation has been implicated in nearly every neuropsychiatric and degenerative disease,
yet neuroimmune cells remain nearly intractable by every available therapeutic strategy. Small
molecule drugs consistently fail clinical trials, as neuroimmune signaling pathways have essential
pleiotropic functions in neighboring cell types. Meanwhile cell type selective therapies remain elusive,
as microglia, and other neuroimmune cells, are intrinsically resistant to gene therapy vectors.
Overcoming these unique challenges demands a new approach to medicine, drawing from an unlikely
source of neuroimmune specific bioactivity.
 In nature, the Zika virus (ZKV) infects microglia, suppresses inflammation, and stimulates
autophagy so expertly that almost half of infections go unnoticed. If this bioactivity could be safely
refined, it would offer relief for neurodegenerative disorders from Parkinson’s to Alzheimer's disease.
Parsing therapeutic from pathogenic mechanisms of the ZKV genome presents much greater
complexity than ever previously addressed, but recent advances make it possible. Recombinant ZKV
vectors, already in use, provide starting material for synthetic biology, while new viral assisted and
continuous evolution methods allow bioengineering at scales capable of reshaping whole genomes.
We can harness ZKV’s microglia specific immunosuppressive mechanisms into therapies with
potential beyond any current technology. This proposal presents the first steps along the path
towards an entirely new kind of therapy for neurodegenerative disorders."
10729513,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains that are resistant to most or all available antibiotics
has created a severe problem for treating tuberculosis. One of the critical impediments to developing drugs that
are effective against these deadly MTB strains is the lack of new antibiotic targets. The trans-translation pathway
for resolving stalled ribosomes is a potential target for drug development because it is required for growth of
MTB in culture. The recent identification of small molecule inhibitors of trans-translation provides essential tools
to determine if trans-translation can be an antibiotic target. The long-term goal of this project is to understand
the role of trans-translation in MTB and to exploit this pathway for antibiotic development. The overall objective
of this proposal is to evaluate the role of trans-translation during MTB infection in vivo. The central hypothesis of
this work is that inhibition of trans-translation during MTB infection will lead to death of all populations of bacteria,
including actively replicating cells and non-replicating persister bacilli. The rationale that underlies the proposed
research is that validation of trans-translation as an anti-TB target will lead to rapid development of new
antibiotics that will dramatically shorten TB treatment times and lead to sterilization of infected tissues. The
proposed research will also make significant contributions to the fundamental scientific understanding of MTB
physiology by determining the role of trans-translation in this organism. The specific aims of this proposal are to
identify the molecular targets of trans-translation inhibitors in MTB, to evaluate the essential role of trans-
translation in survival of MTB under host-relevant conditions, and to characterize the anti-tubercular activity of
acylaminooxadiazole compounds. The proposed experiments use genetic tools and small molecule inhibitors of
trans-translation to determine if trans-translation is required under conditions that approximate normal MTB
physiology, such as growth in macrophages and during infection in mice. The results of these experiments will
provide the basis for understanding the role of trans-translation during stress and infection in bacteria as well as
determining if this pathway can be targeted for drug development. Biochemical and genetic approaches will be
used to identify the molecular targets of active compounds, and structural studies will reveal the molecular basis
of activity. Results from these studies will allow future high-level optimization of drug candidates. By targeting a
pathway that has not been used for antibiotic development, this project will yield new compounds that can be
used individually or in combination with existing tuberculosis therapies."

 As a VA Core Investigator at the HSR&D Center to Improve Veteran Involvement in Care and the
Evidence Synthesis Program Coordinating Center based at the Portland VA Healthcare System, my current
research activities include Scholarly Research, Training emerging scientists, and leading and participating in
Service to VA research and clinical programs. My current work is innovative and highly relevant for one of the
most dynamic and transformative periods for healthcare systems broadly, and for VA healthcare especially.
 The overarching goal of my Scholarly Research activities is to understand and identify ways to improve
chronic disease management, including access, quality, and economic outcomes. I direct research on the
potential for care coordination models to improve chronic disease management for high risk/high need
Veterans and to offset any adverse effects of multi-system health care use across the VA and non-VA health
systems. My past research focused on Veterans with chronic kidney disease and cancer led to my current
focus on high risk/high need Veterans, including ongoing research on Veterans recovering from COVID-19
illness. Our HSR&D grant pending “Care Coordination and Outcomes for High Risk Patients: Building the
Evidence for Implementation”, seeks to identify the current care coordination processes and data resources
necessary to conduct a VA implementation study aimed at improving patient and provider experience and
health outcomes across VA and non-VA settings. The project also includes partnership with the VA Offices of
Community Care, Nursing, and Social Work and other VA offices. Proactive dissemination of my research
findings is done through briefings at stakeholder meetings and professional society meetings. I will continue to
produce peer reviewed publications of my own research and seek a new opportunity to edit a journal
supplement on care coordination as more evidence on implementation science grows and yields results.
 My research Training activities aim to develop the next generation of VA health services researchers
with focus on skill development in methods, measurement, and applying health data resources. I am currently
mentoring four VA early career clinician scientists and one PhD postdoctoral fellow. As a graduate program
director in Health Management and Policy in my university role, I am and will continue to mentor MPH and PhD
candidates and make them aware of the opportunities the VA offers in HSR&D research careers. Further, with
faculty roles in Oregon State University (OSU) College of Public Health and Human Sciences, the OSU Center
for Genome Research and Biocomputing, and Oregon Health and Science University, together with a new
HSR&D Senior Research Career Scientist award, I will be uniquely positioned to develop a new training
program that draws on these multi-institutional relationships. My vision is to develop a new training program in
Data Science for Better Health, including data science to support care coordination process and outcome
measurement and analytics.
 The goals of my research Service activities are to share my research expertise to inform clinical policy
and practice and to contribute to the VA research programs. I will continue involvement in the national VA
efforts to inform implementation of care coordination practice alongside our research. My contributions to
research programs will include continued support of our Veteran engagement efforts, and participation in peer
review activities and on advisory boards for critical VA research programs.
 An award as a Senior Research Career Scientist would provide me with the opportunity to continue and
enrich these important research activities in conducting scholarly and impactful research, training the next
generation of scientists, and enhancing the visibility of VA research through leadership and service, and
ultimately benefiting the Veterans served by VA health systems."
10886812,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Anxiety is the most common pediatric mental health problem, affecting ~10% of children and adolescents1.
Given the substantial prevalence and impact of anxiety, recent interest has focused on characterizing anxiety
within high-anxiety-risk clinical subgroups (e.g., neurodevelopmental disorders) to provide critical insight into
the specific risk factors, developmental pathways, and consequences of anxiety. Individuals with fragile X
syndrome (FXS) constitute one such high-anxiety-risk subgroup, with up to ~80% of adolescents and adults
meeting criteria for at least one anxiety disorder16. Work from our initial NIMH-funded R01 demonstrated that
anxiety emerges early in childhood in FXS, with 39% of preschoolers diagnosed with at least one anxiety
disorder17, and increases in severity across early childhood. The first funding period of this R01 (2016-2023)
was highly successful (26 papers to date) in characterizing the emergence, stability, and prevalence of anxiety
longitudinally across early childhood (3, 4, and 5-7 years) in children with FXS contrasted to children with
idiopathic (i.e., non-syndromic) autism spectrum disorder (nsASD) and neurotypical (NT) children. However,
this work has fueled a new set of questions regarding the developmental trajectory of anxiety symptoms and
diagnoses from early to middle childhood in FXS which are crucial to identifying the stability and consequences
of anxiety in FXS across critical early developmental periods when intervention is known to be most effective.
To address these gaps, this competitive renewal application will leverage our existing, rich, multidimensional
longitudinal dataset and follow our existing cohort of children with FXS, children with nsASD, and NT children
through 8-10 years, as well as recruit a new large cross-sectional cohort of 8-to-10-year-olds. The specific
aims are to (1) Determine change in anxiety symptoms and diagnoses from 3-10 years of age in FXS
contrasted to children with nsASD and NT children; (2) Document the extent to which potential early risk
factors predict change in anxiety symptoms and diagnoses in children with FXS contrasted to children with
nsASD and NT children; and (3) Identify (a) rates of anxiety symptoms and diagnoses, (b) functional
impairment associated with anxiety, and (c) sex differences in children with FXS contrasted to children with
nsASD and NT children during middle childhood. This study is innovative in its inclusion of an IQ-matched
nsASD contrast group, which will answer critical questions on syndrome specificity and amplify our impact by
generating knowledge on the development, predictors, and consequences of anxiety in children with nsASD
and intellectual disability. This work is significant in that it will greatly expand our understanding of anxiety in
FXS by providing critical information about the developmental course, predictors, and consequences of
childhood anxiety, which will inform the timing and targets of intervention that will improve quality of life for
children with FXS and their families."

The T cell receptor interaction with peptide-MHC is unique in that each receptor has the capacity to engage and
differentially respond to functionally distinct ligands. Understanding the molecular basis for these properties is
important not only for mechanistic insight but for clinical translation to antigen-specific immunotherapies. In this
proposal we focus on the chemistry of the TCR/pMHC interface, its role in the specificity of both the recognition
and triggering phases of TCR signal initiation, and the use of this information to advance immunotherapeutic
strategies. In the prior term of this proposal, we developed a technology, yeast peptide-MHC display, which
enabled us obtain a deep understanding of the extent of TCR specificity and cross-reactivity. We found that
TCRs are highly specific for their cognate antigens despite exhibiting cross-reactivity. This property enabled us
to recover the known peptide ligands of TCRs through un-biased screening of pMHC libraries. Now, in Aim #1,
this finding has opened up many exciting possibilities: principally to use pMHC display technology to query the
specificity of TCRs, and to identify peptide ligands for ‘orphan’ TCRs in the natural immune system (e.g. Treg)
or from pathogenic systems (e.g. cancer, autoimmunity, infectious disease). In Aim #2 we wish to then then
generate high-affinity “TCR mimic” antibodies, using a novel platform approach, that specifically recognize these
newly discovered ligands and enables us to track tissue expression and inducing selective killing of cells
expressing these antigens. In Aim #3, we show that pMHC library technology is also powerful for understanding
the relationship between TCR recognition of pMHC and signaling through the capacity of this approach to
generate large panels of peptides that can be characterized with respect to signaling and structure. Using this
technology, we made the surprising finding that high-affinity, but non-stimulatory pMHC ligands exist in the
natural human immune repertoire. We were able to ‘isolate’ the mechanism of TCR triggering to the formation of
“catch bonds” in the TCR/pMHC interface, which can decouple TCR/pMHC binding strength from signaling. In
Aim #3 of the current proposal we wish to expand on our studies of non-stimulatory TCRs to better understand
the molecular mechanisms of triggering at the TCR/pMHC interface, and test a new idea, ‘catch bond
engineering,’ for modifying TCRs to exhibit improved target killing potency in a way that bypasses the dangers
of affinity-matured TCRs in adoptive cell therapy. Collectively, this proposal aims to exploit ‘first principles’ of
TCR/pMHC binding chemistry along three different fronts that have direct translational impact."

Drug addiction is a complex brain disorder that takes an enormous toll on individual and economic health. Current
drug-abuse treatments are not effective in all individuals, and many recovering addicts continue to relapse. Drug
exposure usurps normal reward circuit function, including the connections between the ventral tegmental area
(VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Both NAc and VTA undergo molecular and physiological changes in
response to drugs of abuse. The VTA sends dopaminergic projections to the NAc, and the NAc sends GABAergic
projections back to the VTA. Activity in NAc and VTA are key for driving drug use and are heavily implicated in
drug relapse. Numerous studies have established the importance of the dopaminergic VTA to NAc projection,
however the connection from NAc back to VTA is understudied in drug addiction.
The incidence of opioid use, opioid addiction, and death from opioid overdose are at an unprecedented high. In
this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award, I aim to identify how NAc projections to the VTA influence opioid
use and relapse. Using a mouse model of fentanyl self-administration, I have collected preliminary data showing
NAc neurons that project to VTA control fentanyl seeking after forced abstinence. In this study, I intend to utilize
intersectional circuit manipulation and cutting-edge molecular biology to investigate the molecular mechanisms
by which NAc projections to VTA control fentanyl intake and relapse. During the mentored phase, in Aim 1, I will
learn operant self-administration procedures and combine them with chemogenetic manipulation to assess the
necessity of NAc terminals in VTA in fentanyl use and relapse. In Aim 2, I will learn RNAseq and in situ
hybridization to profile molecular adaptations in specific VTA neurons after fentanyl self-administration. During
the independent phase, in Aim 3, I will use novel viral constructs to assess the role of molecular manipulations
in specific VTA neurons in fentanyl use and relapse. In Aim 4, I will assess the role of fentanyl and molecular
manipulations on dopamine release in the NAc using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Together, the research
proposed in this Pathway to Independence Award will elucidate molecular mechanisms in the NAc-VTA circuit
driving opioid use and relapse, while simultaneously providing me with the tools necessary for establishing an
independent research program that bridges molecular biology, circuit manipulation, operant behavior, and
voltammetry for examining addiction."

 The emergence of drug resistant human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) variants and the lack of
an effective vaccine require the development of novel anti-retroviral drugs. The catalytic activity of HIV-1
integrase (IN) has been successfully targeted by several highly effective and well tolerated IN strand transfer
inhibitors (INSTIs). However, despite high barriers with the second-generation INSTIs, mutations conferring
resistance to multiple INSTIs have been reported in clinical settings. Thus, targeting IN through an alternative
mechanism can complement the existing therapeutic strategies and substantially increase the barrier to
emergence of drug resistant HIV-1 variants upon INSTI treatment.
 IN has long been known to have an enigmatic non-catalytic function in the HIV-1 life cycle. Certain
mutations in IN, collectively referred to as class II mutations, are reportedly pleiotropic and result in defects in
viral particle assembly, maturation and reverse transcription. In a paradigm-shifting study, we have discovered
that HIV-1 IN binds to the viral RNA genome (gRNA) in virions and that this interaction is critically important for
accurate virion morphogenesis. Inhibition of IN-gRNA interactions through allosteric integrase inhibitors
(ALLINIs) or class II IN substitutions results in the formation of aberrant “eccentric” particles with the gRNA is
mislocalized between the empty capsid (CA) lattice and the viral envelope. Furthermore, we have shown that IN
tetramerization is critical for RNA-binding and that a number of class II IN substitutions located throughout IN
inhibit RNA binding through modulation of IN tetramerization. Finally, work from our lab demonstrated that
premature degradation of the gRNA and its physical separation from the reverse transcriptase enzyme in virions
underlies the reverse transcription defects of eccentric particles in target cells. Importantly, this untimely gRNA
degradation is not due to inhibition of IN-gRNA interactions per se, but rather due to loss of protection with the
CA lattice, as a similar outcome was observed upon CA destabilization. Together, these studies cemented the
role of IN-gRNA interactions in virion maturation and demonstrated the critical importance of the CA lattice in
protection of viral nucleic acids in target cells.
 Based on these novel findings and extensive preliminary data, we propose to elucidate the nature and
rules of HIV-1 IN-gRNA interactions, how IN binding to the gRNA mediates proper assembly of the HIV-1 capsid
lattice and how infected cells sense and respond to aberrant particles generated upon inhibition of IN-gRNA
interactions and destabilization of the CA lattice. These studies will fill a critical gap in our understanding of the
critical noncatalytic function of HIV-1 IN in particle maturation and the consequences of inhibiting these
interactions. Together, this project will not only enhance our basic knowledge of HIV-1 replication but also aid in
the development of novel antivirals that can complement INSTI-based therapies in clinical settings."
10738760,"Environmental stress is a major risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, but the fundamental
mechanisms underlying this vulnerability remains unknown. A growing evidence indicates that stress-related
psychopathology arises in part from the dysregulation of brain mesolimbic reward circuitry, which is primarily
comprised of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Our data in rodents indicate
that stress dysregulates reward processing via decreased function of anion transporter KCC2 located in VTA
GABA neurons. This form of stress-induced neuroadaptation in GABAergic signaling has not been fully
characterized, and we plan to investigate its impact on dopamine signaling and reward processing in rats. Given
that VTA GABA neurons provide a major inhibitory input to the mesolimbic dopamine neurons, we will measure
the impact of these neurons and stress-induced KCC2 downregulation on dopamine signaling. These studies
will account for functionally distinct tonic and phasic modes of dopamine neuron activity, which can be
differentially regulated by VTA GABA neurons. Heterogeneous populations of dopamine neurons participate in
anatomically separate circuits that mediate different aspects of reward processing. To test if stress-induced
KCC2 hypofunction dysregulates dopamine signaling in a circuit-specific manner, we will measure GABAergic
transmission onto specific dopamine projections to the core, medial, and lateral shell of the NAc. Ultimately, we
will examine the role of stress-induced KCC2 downregulation and VTA GABA neurons in different aspects of
reward processing. Rats will be exposed to acute stress and we will measure reward learning and incentive
motivation while manipulating KCC2 in VTA GABA neurons. Behavioral tasks will be accompanied by multi-unit
electrophysiology and optogenetics to further explore the contribution of different VTA neuron types to distinct
reward processes. Taken together, these studies will comprehensively examine the impact of stress on reward
processing and hold the potential to improve our understanding of GABAergic regulation of complex dopamine
signaling."

Single-cell genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic technologies can identify unique cell subsets with important
physiologic roles; however, RNA or DNA signatures cannot always be linked to unique surface markers,
hampering the re-isolation of these cell subsets for in-depth analyses. Moreover, conventional single-cell
methods require sequencing prohibitively large numbers of cells to characterize rare subsets. Here we will
develop and apply SEARCH-seq, a high-throughput cytometry method that detects RNA or DNA markers with
single molecule sensitivity that allows the rapid isolation of target cells for in-depth transcriptomic, genomic, or
epigenomic analyses. We will use the method to study the regulatory mechanisms controlling an astrocyte
subpopulation characterized by an alternatively spliced XBP1 transcript, which promotes disease pathology in
multiple sclerosis (MS). This subpopulation also manifests in the pre-clinical mouse model of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using SEARCH-seq in combination with conditional knock-out mice, in
vivo CRISPR/Cas9-driven perturbation studies, and RNA-seq analyses of mouse EAE and human MS samples,
we will characterize the role of these cells and their interaction with the nuclear receptor NR3C2 and its
corepressor NCOR2 in limiting XBP1-driven pathogenic astrocyte responses. In summary, SEARCH-seq is a
novel, sensitive, and high throughput method to capture rare brain cell subsets that are difficult to study with
existing technology and may have therapeutically targetable mechanisms relevant to MS pathogenesis."

Excessive adipose tissue expansion causes obesity, a major risk factor for the development of metabolic
disease. Three types of fat cells exist -white, brown and beige- involved in maintaining the balance between
calories hoarded and those consumed. It has been recently suggested that increasing energy dissipation via the
induction of thermogenesis in brown and beige adipocytes could represent a strategy to combat metabolic
disease; however, at the present time, our understanding of the key targetable regulators involved in this process
is still limited. My laboratory has identified the heat shock factor HSF1 as a novel transcriptional regulator of
thermogenesis and has preliminary evidence demonstrating that HSF1 regulates histone demethylases, that
obesity is associated with low levels of HSF1 and that ablation of HSF1 in fat leads to metabolic dysfunction.
Based on this knowledge, we propose to determine how fat tissue is epigenetically reprogrammed in obese
states and identify new molecular mechanisms controlling adipose tissue biology through the analysis of novel
upstream regulators and downstream effectors of HSF1 in fat. The results of our studies will identify novel
regulatory mechanisms controlling adipose tissue biology and specific epigenetic signatures contradistinctive of
obese fat, identify HSF1 is a novel molecular link between extrinsic stimuli and transcriptional and epigenetic re-
programming of adipose tissue, and a possible new therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction.
To perform the studies outlined we will take advantage of unique fat specific HSF1- and adenosine receptor A2A
knock-out mice generated in our laboratory and of techniques and reagents generated over the years and more
innovative ones. In Aim 1 will identify novel chromatin signatures in adipose tissues associated with obesity and
will assess the role of HSF1 in the epigenetic control of adipose tissue biology and homeostasis; in Aim 2 we
will characterize novel regulators of adipocyte biology through the identification of new molecular targets of HSF1
in adipocytes, using state-of-the-art next generation sequencing technologies, in addition to candidate
approaches; in Aim 3 we will identify novel pathways regulating innate thermogenesis in fat cells.
We expect that the studies outlined will illuminate novel mechanisms that control energy balance in physiological
and pathological metabolic states and will define new approaches to increase energy dissipation and combat
metabolic disease."

To divide, cells must faithfully partition their duplicated genomes (mitosis) and then separate (cytokinesis). The final
abscission step of cytokinesis is catalyzed by the ESCRT machinery, which severs the midbody to separate the nascent
daughter cells. This step is negatively regulated by the NoCut/abscission checkpoint in response to mitotic errors such as
intercellular DNA bridges or incomplete nuclear pore formation, providing cells with time to correct errors or mount
protective responses. NoCut failure therefore results in DNA damage and is linked to several types of cancer.
Within the midbody, ESCRT-III proteins form membrane-bound filaments that collaborate with VPS4 ATPases to constrict
and cut the membrane. These filaments also bind other MIT domain-containing cofactors that participate in NoCut and
abscission. We previously identified three classes of MIT enzymes with important cytokinetic functions: 1) ULK3 kinase,
which phosphorylates and inactivates ESCRT-III proteins, 2) VPS4s and related “meiotic clade” AAA ATPases, and 3) the
CAPN7 cysteine protease. We will now study how the latter two classes of MIT enzymes function during cytokinesis to
remodel ESCRT-III filaments (VPS4s), sever spindle microtubules (SPASTIN and KATANIN), or sustain NoCut signaling
and then promote abscission (CAPN7 and SPASTIN). We have also recently discovered a previously uncharacterized
cytoplasmic organelle, the Abscission Checkpoint Body (ACB), that contributes to NoCut abscission delay, apparently by
sequestering essential ESCRT abscission factors like ALIX away from the midbody. We will now elucidate how ACBs
form and help to regulate abscission timing. Our ultimate goal is to define how cells maintain NoCut signaling to prevent
premature abscission, and then sever the midbody to create separate daughter cells."

The economic, physical and emotional harms borne by AUD-affected families are great. 7.5 million U.S. children
live with an AUD-affected parent and have increased risk for poverty, abuse and neglect in addition to heightened
genetic risk for alcohol problems. Remission from AUDs is common, but this is seldom acknowledged in
research on the costs and consequences of AUDs. Up to 50% of individuals with lifetime AUDs experience
remission, many within 14 years of AUD onset and many during prime child-bearing and child-rearing years. Our
broad goal for this project is to comprehensively probe the remission phenotype and its role in the
intergenerational transmission of AUDs. We will use family-based data from the Collaborative Study on the
Genetics of Alcoholism, a study ongoing since 1989 that recruits families with heightened risk for AUDs and
more than 15,000 ever-drinkers. Because of COGA's high-risk design, there are sufficient numbers of AUD-
affected individuals (N=7724, 49%), and therefore available for remission, to permit this examination of remission
within families and its effect on offspring outcomes. In Aim 1 we will use survival analysis and person-centered
longitudinal methods to characterize the course of AUD and remission (chronic AUD, stable or relapsing
remission, movement through different types of remission [abstinent, non-abstinent]) and identify demographic
and behavioral antecedents and sequalae of remission and relapse (marital status, children, employment,
income, education, co-occurring substance and psychiatric disorders, treatment). In exploratory analysis, we will
construct a measure of family density of remission and test its association with AUD and remission. Because the
genetic and environmental factors that influence AUD and remission do not entirely overlap, we expect this
measure to have a small but significant association with the probability of not developing AUD and with the
likelihood of remission in individuals with AUD, independent of polygenic risk (PRS) for AUD. In Aim 2, we use
biological parent-offspring pairs to characterize the familial environment of adolescent offspring (household
income, parental marital status, childhood trauma) and variation in adolescent and adult offspring alcohol use
and AUD/remission as a function of parental AUD/remission. Sibling comparisons will delineate for whom
parental remission is likely to have the greatest impact, while providing rigorous control for potential genetic and
environmental confounders shared by siblings. The proposal is innovative in its focus on resilience, rather than
risk, in individuals and families; in its extension of the influence of parental AUD/remission into young and mid-
adulthood; and in its use of a genetically-informed approach to understanding the role of remission in the
intergenerational transmission of AUDs. Results can provide leverage for clinicians to encourage recovery in
patients who are or plan to become parents and will contribute to improved prevention and treatment efforts to
reduce the intergenerational transmission of AUDs and associated problems."

Bladder cancer is the 4th most common cancer in men and 11th in women. Despite that bladder
development and function are not sex hormone-dependent, men are three times more likely to develop
bladder cancer than women. Smoking has been shown not to be a contributor for this gender bias. Instead,
intrinsic sex-differences likely underpin the molecular mechanism for male susceptibility to bladder cancer.
Sex hormones and sex chromosomes are obvious suspects to account for this male predilection for
bladder cancer. In fact, experimental evidence in rodents strongly support a crucial role for androgen
receptor in promoting cancer development in a chemical-induced bladder cancer model. In addition to
androgen signaling, the other undeniably powerful regulator of lower urinary tract development and
carcinogenesis is the WNT signaling pathway. β-catenin is the signal integrator of canonical WNT signaling
and AR and β-catenin physically interact to synergistically activate transcription. This interaction is crucial
for downstream target expression during genital masculinization, bladder cancer development and
progression. Despite the crucial roles these two pathways play in bladder carcinogenesis, their direct
transcriptional targets, which are likely drivers of bladder cancer initiation, remain elusive. In this
application, we propose to use a recently developed powerful technology, Split DamID to reveal in vivo
transcriptional targets downstream of AR, p300 and β-catenin during bladder cancer development. In Aim
1, we will use our newly generated transgenic model to reveal direct AR and p300 transcriptional targets in
a carcinogen-induced bladder cancer model. Next, in Aim 2, we will use SpDamID on bladder organoids to
reveal AR and β-catenin direct targets, followed by siRNA functional screen for their roles in promoting
organoid formation. Together, these studies should greatly improve our understanding of bladder cancer
initiation, especially those controlled by AR and Wnt signaling."

The induction of type I interferon (IFN-I) cytokines plays an essential role in the innate immune response to
virus infections by eliciting an antiviral gene program that facilitates the suppression of virus replication and
spread. Cytosolic detection of viral nucleic acids by germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
serves as an initial first step in activating the IFN-I response. Emerging studies however, have linked
previously unknown roles for DNA sensing PRRs in detecting aberrant DNA species of self-origin to trigger the
onset of age-related diseases, neurological disorders, and autoinflammatory conditions in the absence of
infection. Thus, there is a critical need to delineate the mechanisms by which nucleic acid sensing PRRs
control IFN-I activation to develop the next generation of therapeutics to combat viral infections as well as DNA
damage driven disease states. We have recently identified a novel cross-talk phenomenon between cytosolic
nucleic acid sensing PRRs that activate IFN-I and the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. While the non-canonical
NF-κB pathway primarily governs lymphoid organogenesis and B-cell survival and maintenance in response to
extracellular ligation of select members of the TNF receptor superfamily, our data unexpectedly revealed that
intracellular ligation of nucleic acid sensing cytosolic PRRs also resulted in non-canonical NF-κB activation by
causing the turnover of TNF receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF3), a key component of a steady-state negative
regulatory complex that persistently causes the destabilization of the non-canonical NF-ĸB inducing kinase
(NIK) which initiates signaling to the non-canonical NF-ĸB transcription factor complex. Our preliminary data
further established that TRAF3 and NIK operate as differential regulators of IFN-I activation downstream of
RNA and DNA sensing cytosolic PRRs. However, the mechanisms by which TRAF3 and NIK are controlled to
modulate non-canonical NF-κB and IFN-I activation upon nucleic acid detection by cytosolic PRRs are poorly
defined. Here we interrogated published data sets that examined TRAF3 and NIK protein interaction networks
with a goal of identifying novel candidates with the potential to modulate how the non-canonical NF-κB
pathway undergoes activation during cytosolic nucleic acid signaling and how the non-canonical NF-κB
effector, NIK cross-talks with the IFN-I signaling platform. We identify synaptosome associated protein 29
(SNAP29) as a TRAF3 interacting partner and seek to characterize how SNAP29 modulates TRAF3 function in
the context non-canonical NF-ĸB and IFN-I pathway activation. Our studies will help define new regulatory
elements that control not only antiviral host defense programs, but also immune development and age related
autoinflammatory disease states triggered by DNA damage or chromosomal instability."

Avoiding potential threats before experiencing disastrous events is critical for survival, yet excessive avoidance
may lead to maladaptive conditions such as withdrawal or missing rewarding events. Abnormalities in threat-
coping may underlie psychiatric conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders.
Recent studies have shown a critical role for the sensory part of the striatum, the posterior tail of the striatum
(TS), in avoidance of a potential threat. These studies have indicated that TS-projecting dopamine neurons are
activated by salient threatening stimuli, and animals avoid activation of these neurons. The role of the TS in
threat avoidance has been pursued further using a foraging paradigm (“Monster task”) in which mice are
presented with a potential threat (a moving monster) while they forage for a reward. In this task, although mice
never experienced physical harm, they exhibited three stages of threat-response: initial reactive avoidance,
gradually-acquired proactive avoidance, and eventual overcoming of the threat to obtain reward. Lesions of
TS-projecting dopamine neurons impaired threat avoidance. Further, preliminary results indicate that, in the
TS, medium spiny neurons in direct and indirect pathways (dMSNs and iMSNs) facilitate threat avoidance and
overcoming, respectively. Building on these observations, the goal of this project is to elucidate the neural
mechanisms by which TS and associated circuits of the basal ganglia function to regulate progression of
threat-coping. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that dopamine in TS represents threat prediction error and
regulates threat-coping by dual modes of functioning, acute and learning-based actions. To this end, dopamine
release in TS will be monitored using fiber photometry or manipulated optogenetically during the Monster task.
Aim 2 will examine the striatal circuit mechanisms by which dopamine regulates threat-coping. The specific
hypotheses to be tested are that (1) the balance between dMSNs and iMSNs determines the behavioral output
(threat avoidance vs. overcoming), and that (2) phasic dopamine signals modulate the balance between these
opponent circuits through both acute and learning-based mechanisms. Finally, Threat-coping can involve at
least two distinct processes: action selection (choosing to approach or avoid) and/or changes in sensory
processing (adjusting the salience of a potentially threatening stimulus). Aim 3 will aim to identify pathways
downstream of TS which are involved in these processes. Specifically, this aim will test the hypotheses that (1)
the integration of dMSN and iMSN activities occurs in the substantia nigra pars lateralis (SNL) which then
regulates avoidance behavior, and that (2) the TS-globus pallidus-thalamic reticular nucleus pathway
modulates sensory representation in lateral geniculate nucleus to attend or overcome a monster threat.
Overall, this study will elucidate a role for novel neural circuits (TS and associated basal ganglia pathways) in
three stages of threat-coping, initial reactive avoidance, proactive avoidance, and overcoming of the threat."

More than a quarter of all adults older than 75 years have symptomatic stable ischemic heart disease. Stress
nuclear imaging is the one of the most common tests performed for diagnosis and management of coronary
artery disease in these older adults. Older adults are more likely to have co-existing impairments in function,
cognition and multimorbidity, which may limit their benefit from imaging tests and post-test treatment, alike.
Although stress testing is often used to evaluate symptoms, clinicians are less likely to refer older adults for
revascularization or to optimize their medical therapy, even if stress test results are severely abnormal. In turn,
this can result in overuse of testing, increased complications and cost of care without improving patient
outcomes. To help older patients presenting with suspected ischemic symptoms make a well-informed
decision, clinicians should contextualize the benefits of imaging and treatment strategies post imaging in
context of elicited goals of care, clinical
impairments. It is critical to understand
presentation, cardiac risk factors and potential age-related
how to improve shared decision making among older adults and identify
areas of imaging test overuse or underuse among older adults with symptomatic stable ischemic heart
disease.
In this project, I use a multi-stakeholder approach to understand post-stress test decision making from patient,
caregiver and physician perspectives and study its association with outcomes among symptomatic older adults
with suspected or known CAD. My research aims are to (a) understand older patient and caregiver attitudes
about post-imaging treatment choice in context of their preferred outcomes and age-related impairments
through focus group interviews and (b1) examine the association between cardiovascular and geriatric risk
factors on post-imaging treatment choice (i.e., invasive referral vs. medical optimization); and (b2) compare the
association of treatment received post-imaging and patients' symptoms, function and quality of life among
symptomatic older adults  75 years undergoing clinically indicated stress nuclear imaging within our health
system. This study will help inform my future work aimed at developing and testing personalized decision aids
to guide choice of testing and treatment for symptomatic older adults with CAD. This GEMSSTAR award will
also provide me with the support, mentorship and training required to become a leader in field of
cardiovascular imaging and shared decision-making for older adults with stable ischemic heart disease."

Maintenance of proper mitochondrial function is critical to organismal health. Mitochondrial stress contributes to
ageing and the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. Intracellular insults, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial
DNA mutations, and disrupted interactions with other organelles including lysosomes and the endoplasmic
reticulum are relatively well identified inducers of mitochondrial dysfunction. Yet it remains largely elusive how
mitochondrial homeostasis can be altered upon changes in cellular microenvironment, the extracellular matrix
(ECM).
In mammals, ECM remodeling occurs during aging and in multiple diseases including infections, cancers, and
neurodegeneration. The remodeled ECM may liberate bioactive fragments that can promote tissue damage-
related responses, such as wound healing and inflammation. TMEM2 is a plasma membrane-bound
hyaluronidase that cleaves hyaluronan, a major glycosaminoglycan constituent of the ECM in vertebrates. We
discovered that TMEM2 induces mitochondrial stress responses in both human cells and nematodes, suggesting
a novel conserved link between the ECM and mitochondria. In aim 1 and 2 of this proposal, we will systemically
characterize TMEM2-induced global changes on mitochondria, determine what specific changes to the ECM are
causative of these changes, and identify essential genetic regulators of the pathway in mammals and nematodes.
Both aging and infection are associated with profound changes in the ECM. We observed that TMEM2 promotes
longevity and immunity in nematodes, most likely due to changes to the ECM. We hypothesize that TMEM2-
induced ECM degradation may be sensed as a signal of tissue damage mimicking infection or other
environmental stress, which may elicit mitochondrial stress to potentiate mitochondrial stress responses and
innate immune responses, and eventually prolong the lifespan due to these protective stress responses. In aim
3, we will test whether TMEM2-induced longevity is mediated by mitochondrial signaling, and whether the ECM-
mitochondria signaling may be involved in immune responses during infection. Moreover, we will perform mass
spectrometry as well as functional genomic screens to systemically assess the role of ECM remodeling in
regulating mitochondrial homeostasis during aging."

 With the use of newer therapies that improve clinical outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an increasing
number of older adults (1.3 million) are now living with RA, a chronic, inflammatory disease. RA is also
associated with an increased risk of certain cancers compared to the general population. Although an
increasing number of older adults are living with RA and cancer, clinical trials often exclude older adults. There
remains very little evidence-based guidance for management of older adults with comorbid RA and cancer.
 Although a few studies have examined the survival of patients with both RA and cancer relative to those
with cancer alone, these are based on cohorts of patients from several years ago (prior to widespread use of
biologics). Given the dramatic changes in treatment of RA and cancer in recent years, an examination of
survival for major forms of cancer in more contemporary cohorts of older adults with RA is warranted. Similarly,
very little is known about the impact of geriatric syndromes such as frailty on outcomes (e.g., cancer survival)
among patients with comorbid RA and cancer. Also, it has been shown that reduced lean mass and high fat
mass are prevalent in patients with RA alone or cancer alone and impact survival but very little is known about
the changes in body composition among older adults with concurrent RA and cancer.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to examine the association between RA and overall survival (Aim 1),
body composition, frailty, and quality of life (QOL) (Aim 2) in older adults with cancer compared to those with
cancer without RA. To achieve this goal, we have developed two complementary aims. Aim 1A will use the
nationwide Veterans Affairs databases to assess the differences in survival between the two groups of older
adults (cancer with RA versus cancer without RA) and Aim1B will examine the association between frailty and
survival among those with RA and cancer. Aim 2 is a cross-sectional study and will include measures of body
composition, Fried frailty phenotype, and patient-reported QOL- measures that are unavailable in large
databases. We will compare these measures between older adults with RA and cancer to those with cancer
without RA.
 Together with my mentorship team, the career development and research plan, this GEMSSTAR award will
enable me to obtain the necessary training in the principles of geriatrics, such as assessment of frailty and
sarcopenia, to help advance the research in this area and my career as an investigator focused on improving
outcomes for older adults with rheumatic diseases and cancer. Results from this study have the potential to
provide critical preliminary data for a future R01 application where we expand our findings in a multicenter
prospective cohort to risk stratify older adults with rheumatic diseases and cancer to ultimately develop
interventions to improve their quality of life and potentially survival."
10899610,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2, disproportionately affect residents of correctional facilities (jails
and prisons). While the Federal Bureau of Prisons and state Departments of Correction (DOCs) implemented
numerous prevention strategies including social distancing protocols, vaccination campaigns, and testing
programs to mitigate transmission and reduce the disease burden, overarching guidance on COVID-19
prevention within correctional facilities is limited. As a result, DOCs must develop and modify their policies based
on existing evidence regarding the effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention strategies within correctional facilities.
Unfortunately, the existing evidence base is limited. Specifically, the effectiveness of prevention strategies has
principally been estimated in isolation (not in combination with other strategies) and while holding the variant
constant. Because of this, DOCs are left with little evidence on how to implement and adapt prevention strategies
in combination and under the ever-changing COVID-19 landscape. With the goal of expanding the evidence
base for infectious disease prevention strategies within correctional facilities, we will estimate the effects of
testing and vaccination on the burden of COVID-19 in both jails and prisons. To do so, we will develop an
individual level discrete time hazard (transmission) model of SARS-CoV-2 and test the feasibility and reliability
of a cutting-edge statistical causal inference approach as an alternative to transmission modeling (Aims 1 & 2).
To examine the effects of testing and vaccination in combination and to identify scenarios when strategies require
modification to contain spread and reduce disease burden, we will simulate waves of SARS-CoV-2 in the
community and identify the strategy combinations required to prevent outbreaks within facilities using our
transmission models (Aim 3). The proposed simulation approach will allow for the simulation of SARS-CoV-2
transmission and disease under known and future, theoretical scenarios. The execution of the proposed aims
will strengthen the evidence available to DOCs and other policymakers and could make possible the estimation
of indirect treatment effects under a causal framework within complex, nested social networks. In addition, their
execution, coupled with the proposed training program comprising coursework, structured mentoring, and
experiential learning, will allow Dr. Lind (the candidate) to enrich her knowledge of infectious disease
transmission modeling, causal inference methods for treatment effect estimation in the presence of interference,
and health disparities and infection control within a highly marginalized population, residents of correctional
facilities. The candidate has established an expert mentoring and advisory team led by Dr. Albert Ko at the
Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases Department at the Yale School of Public Health to enable this training, guide
Dr. Lind's transition to independence during the R00 award phase and support her growth as an independently
funded infectious disease epidemiologist."
10890197,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The rising number of children being identified as autistic has led to exponential growth in for-profit applied
behavior analysis (ABA) agencies serving them, the use of highly structured approaches that may not be
developmentally appropriate for young children1 and that limit use of learned skills across settings and time,
and growing public health concerns regarding limited effectiveness data combined with the cost of services.
Efficacy testing has led to growth in evidence-based autism interventions (EBI), especially naturalistic
developmental behavior interventions (NDBIs), supported by multiple clinical trials. NDBIs integrate theory and
strategies from ABA and developmental science and are considered best practice for young autistic children.
The lack of effectiveness data regarding NDBI use in community-based agencies (CBAs) contributes to limited
funding as payors are more likely to recognize older, structured methods. The Early Start Denver Model
(ESDM) is a comprehensive NDBI shown to improve social communication and language outcomes for young
autistic children in multiple controlled efficacy studies. ESDM engages social motivation as a mechanism to
increase child engagement in social learning opportunities in the environment resulting in increased rate of
child learning. ESDM includes assessment and data collection methods that meet funder requirements and a
tested community training model. Understanding whether ESDM is effective and whether the same treatment
mechanisms operating in efficacy trials are also operating in community implementation with diverse samples
are critical scientific questions to determine the potential of NDBIs like ESDM to meet the public health goals of
improving access to high quality, developmentally appropriate care for a broad range of young autistic children
and their families. To facilitate scale up, we have partnered with autism CBAs and this study will identify factors
that affect implementation of ESDM in the community. This project will use a hybrid type 1 randomized
controlled design to examine ESDM effectiveness in the community and to gather data on implementation
determinants. Primary child outcomes include language and social communication. Secondary outcomes
include adaptive behavior, parent use of ESDM strategies, and provider fidelity to the model. Social motivation
and caregiver fidelity will be measured as mediating variables. The moderating effects of maternal education,
child race/ethnicity, and provider ESDM fidelity will be examined. ESDM implementation determinants will be
explored. Understanding the effectiveness of an intervention like ESDM, the variables that mediate and
moderate child outcomes, and engagement of its mechanisms of action in community use, has the potential to
increase availability, and therefore, access to high quality intervention for all young autistic children, especially
those from diverse backgrounds who depend on public services. Understanding implementation determinants
will support scale-up of effective models throughout communities."
10911284,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hemorrhage is accountable for approximately 40% of deaths due to traumatic injuries worldwide as well as the
leading cause of mortality in Americans 1-46 years of age. Since high rate of hemorrhage-induced deaths
occur before reaching definitive care, providing immediate life-saving interventions to hemorrhaging patients is
of paramount importance. Blood pressure (BP) management is a very important component of hemorrhage
resuscitation due to its central role in (i) reducing the hemorrhage-induced mortality as well as in (ii) developing
novel hemorrhage resuscitation protocols in clinical trials. But, clinicians are not effective at maintaining BP
within a goal range, and BP management protocol failures are common in clinical trials. Regardless, there is
no mature technology ready for clinical use to support clinicians with BP management.
 By extending its ongoing success with an autonomous vasopressor administration guidance technology
currently undergoing a clinical trial under an FDA IDE, the investigative team proposes to develop a learning-
enabled autonomous decision-support (LEAD) system for BP management during hemorrhage resuscitation,
which can predict future BP in a patient and recommend timings and doses of resuscitation fluid administration
in order to maintain the patient’s BP within a clinician-specified goal range, while continuously optimizing its
accuracy by learning the patient’s response to administration of fluids. The LEAD system will be suitable for
clinical use in ICUs, EDs, and even pre-hospital environments. The LEAD system will be most impactful when
a clinician is novice, distracted, or tired. In addition, by maintaining clinicians in the loop, there will be much
reduced regulatory risk, allowing for rapid transition to a clinical trial and dissemination. In this way, the LEAD
system has the potential to enable tight BP management during hemorrhage resuscitation by enhancing the
awareness of clinicians on a patient’s dynamic treatment trajectory.
 Key innovations pertaining to the LEAD system are (i) a novel population-informed, recursive, collective
statistical inference approach to prediction of future BP in a patient based on a physics-based physiological
model and a collective inference developed by the investigative team and (ii) its real-world implementation into
a computational user interface platform being ready for clinical use. To realize and validate the LEAD system,
we will (i) develop a BP prediction algorithm for the LEAD system via population-informed recursive collective
inference (SA1); (ii) evaluate the LEAD BP prediction algorithm using clinical datasets (SA2); and (iii) realize
the LEAD system using a computational user interface platform and conduct simulated real-time testing (SA3).
 If this project is successful, the investigative team will proceed to technology commercialization and
translation by pursuing a follow-up R01 proposal to optimize the LEAD system algorithm and user interface
platform, and conduct a clinical trial under an FDA IDE."

This makes integration and comparison much easier across all HuBMAP data. In addition, all

10931721,"Project Summary
Renal cell carcinoma is among the ten most prevalent malignances in the United States, exhibiting an
increased incidence in both men and women since 2001. The most common kidney cancer subtype is “clear
cell” renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which accounts for ~75% of all cases. For early-stage disease, surgical
resection of ccRCCs can be curative, although survival drops significantly for advanced, metastatic cancers.
Multiple therapies are now available to ccRCC patients, including anti-angiogenic VEGF/receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint blockade, mTORC1-based drugs, and a novel HIF-2a inhibitor.
However, not all patients respond to these treatments and five-year relapse rates now approach 40%, and the
majority of these cases develop metastases. Importantly, ccRCCs lack common oncogenic mutations
observed in other human cancers, including PI3K, PTEN, TP53, and KRAS, which hinders successful
treatment using corresponding targeted therapies. Instead, we have generated copy number variation,
transcriptomic, and metabolomic data to identify multiple metabolic pathways that are universally altered in
ccRCC tumors. These include loss of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1 (FBP1) and
urea cycle enzymes, including argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), and
arginase 2 (ARG2). Finally, ccRCCs exhibit unusually high numbers of lipid droplets, organelles which store
triglycerides and cholesterol esters and a hallmark of this disease. By delineating the molecular consequences
of these universal metabolic changes, we have developed new therapeutic strategies to target most patients
diagnosed with this kidney cancer subtype. Moreover, our findings have been extended to other cancers such
as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) which appear to engage in highly similar
metabolic reprogramming. Our data demonstrate that “senolytics” like ABT-263 could be deployed for the
treatment of HCC, whereas ITX-5061, an inhibitor of the HDL cholesterol transporter SCARB1, may be
effective for treating ccRCC. The results are paradigm-shifting in that understandable skepticism remains
regarding the utility of “drugging” cancer metabolism, considering the metabolic heterogeneity, plasticity, and
redundancy observed in various cancers. However, our results using autochthonous in vivo tumor models
provide a rationale for deeper exploration. Ongoing and future work will investigate how consistent metabolic
adaptations within the tumor parenchyma impact stromal components, such as fibroblasts and immune cells,
based on an arsenal of complementary in vitro and in vivo models, that include novel autochthonous HCC and
STS mouse models and ccRCC and HCC patient derived xenografts and organoids. A principal conceptual
innovation of our recent work is the demonstration that multiple metabolic networks are consistently altered
(~100%) in genetically diverse cancers like ccRCC, HCC, and STS, and the identification of novel, highly
feasible therapeutic strategies."

The research objective of this K01 is to understand how wildfire smoke (WFS) exposure and other maternal
stressors converge and contribute to preterm birth differentially across socio-demographic groups. Prematurity
is a major determinant of newborn death and disability. There are substantial disparities in the U.S. where the
rate of preterm births among American Indian/Alaska Native women is 26% higher than the rate among all U.S.
mothers. The research will consist of three Specific Aims. (Aim 1): Evaluate the association between exposure
of pregnant women in Alaska to WFS and preterm birth. We hypothesize that maternal WFS exposure is
associated with adverse birth outcomes, particularly when exposed at critical developmental windows during
gestation. We will develop a historical, spatially explicit WFS layer using the NOAA HYSPLIT model. We will
combine model output with Alaskan birth records from 2000-2020 (n=220,000) to estimate associations between
WFS exposure and birth outcomes, controlling for maternal smoking, age, parity, and pre-pregnancy co-
morbidities. (Aim 2): Assess effect modification of the relationship between WFS exposure and adverse birth
outcomes by maternal characteristics, access to healthcare, and geographic remoteness. We will utilize

characteristics modify the relation between WFS exposure and birth outcomes. (Aim 3): Test the combined effect
of stressful life events during pregnancy and WFS exposure on preterm birth. Using a subset of our sample

10738809,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award is to provide the candidate with
the conceptual knowledge and technical skills needed to pursue an independent research career as a
computational cognitive neuroscientist focused on aging and late-life mood disorders. The candidate has a
strong background in cognitive paradigm design and functional neuroimaging methodology, and an evolving
interest in computational modeling of cognitive and affective dysfunctions in depressed older adults. The
research study will use computational approaches to clarify disrupted mechanisms of reward and salience
processes and may lead to findings that can serve as data-driven targets for future personalized treatments.
The proposed training consists of formal courses, structured tutorials, and hands-on methodological instruction
intended to strengthen the candidate's understanding and development of computational models for the study
of Positive Valence Systems (PVS) abnormalities in aging and late-life depression. Her mentoring team
consists of accomplished investigators who will provide guidance and training in neurobiological and
computational approaches for the study of reward and salience abnormalities.
The research study complements the candidate's training plan, as it focuses on PVS dysfunctions that may
contribute to reward processing abnormalities in normal aging and late-life depression. It is based on the
prediction that aging-related abnormalities in reward circuits interacting with neurobiological abnormalities of
depression may alter reward expectancy and reward responsiveness, leading depressed older adults to assign
greater affective salience to negative stimuli. Accordingly, the study proposes to investigate the impact of the
effects of aging and depressive symptoms on prediction error encoding of affectively salient stimuli at three
levels of analysis: circuits, behavior, and self-report. The participants will be older adults aged 60-85 years with
major depression (N = 34, stratified into two levels of severity) or no history or presence of psychopathology (N
= 34).
The proposed study will use task-based fMRI and computational modeling to examine how the dynamic
interaction of age and late-life depressive symptomatology influences neural network functions and the
resulting reward and salience processing behaviors. This study and the studies to follow promise to identify
personalized behavioral and neurobiological targets for much-needed interventions. This work is timely, as
advances in cognitive remediation, brain stimulation, and targeted behavioral interventions are becoming
increasingly capable of influencing selective neurobiological functions and associated behaviors."

 Precision therapies for aggressive or metastatic cancers, while offering the promise of greater efficacy
and less toxicity, rarely achieve durable responses and only modestly extend a patient's life. The major
limitation to these approaches is that cancer cells evolve and alternate signaling pathways can compensate for
pathways blocked with targeted therapies, i.e. multiple alternative mechanisms to activate the
EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway lead to a ""whack-a-mole"" approach with serial treatment with different kinase
inhibitors. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a conserved family of protein kinases that play a central role
in regulating the eukaryotic cell cycle. CDK1 in conjunction with its activating subunit, Cyclin B, plays a critical
role in permitting cells to enter mitosis, coordinates the events required for faithful mitotic progression and
chromosome segregation. To our knowledge, CDK1/B activity is essential for all cells to proliferate and there
are no alternative pathways to bypass the requirement for CDK1. We hypothesize that CDK1 is an ideal
therapeutic target in the context of specific oncogenic signaling pathways which result in an abortive cell cycle
program, such as cell death or senescence, while non-tumor cells are only transiently arrested. Until now,
specific inhibitors of CDK1 have not existed, limiting our ability to discover the underlying mechanisms of CDK1
inhibition as a cancer therapy. Our lab developed a novel engineered mouse, using a chemical-genetic
approach, that allows us to inhibit CDK1 selectively and reversibly in normal and oncogene transformed cells,
or in the context of transgenic tumor models. Our aims will define the mechanisms through which CDK1 elicits
growth arrest and senescence (Aim 1), regulates the unfolded protein response (Aim 2), and how CDK1
inhibition and other therapeutics can be best combined to block tumor growth (Aim 3). We bring together a
team with a track record of innovative research in oncogene signaling and cell cycle regulation (Andrei Goga);
expertise in chemical biology and analog-sensitive kinases (Kevan Shokat); in vivo studies of senescence (Anil
Bhushan) and expertise in mechanisms of regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). We hypothesize
that CDK1 controls previously unexplored cellular processes which can be exploited for tumor-specific
vulnerabilities. Such discoveries will hasten the clinical translation of CDK1 inhibitors for a broad variety of
human cancers."

Debilitating pain, a hallmark of tissue injury and neuropathy, is an unmet clinical challenge particularly in
musculoskeletal diseases, such as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur following orthopedic surgery
and traumatic injuries, manifests with pathological bone formation in muscle and connective tissues. However,
little progress has been made in developing effective treatments for either HO or its associated pain.
Persistent neuropathic pain can arise from hyperexcitability of sensory neuron nociceptors in dorsal root
ganglia (DRG), which release neuropeptides, interact with immune cells, and modulate the host response
after injury to innervated tissues including bone and muscle. A critical link between bone homeostasis and
neuropathic pain has been suggested by the impaired ossification and bone loss in mice lacking Trpv1+
nociceptors. Although the mechanisms that underlie HO formation or HO related pain are poorly understood,
important insights derive from studies of an hereditary HO subset, namely Fibrodysplasia Ossificans
Progressiva (FOP). FOP is commonly caused by an arginine206 to histidine gain-of-function point mutation in
the BMP type I receptor (ACVR1, also known as ALK2) in 97% of patients. We recently found that adult
patients with FOP have baseline heat and mechanical hypersensitivity, in the absence of an inflammatory
flareup. Utilizing FOP patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived nociceptive sensory neurons
(iSNs), we demonstrated that ACVR1R206H is both necessary and sufficient for the hyperexcitability of
nociceptors, a hallmark of neuropathic pain. To determine whether neuronal ACVR1 hyperactivity is also
relevant to more common neuropathic pain conditions, we conditionally expressed activating Acvr1R206H in
sensory neurons of non-FOP transgenic mice. This led to a remarkable recapitulation of the mechanical and
heat hypersensitivity in patients with FOP. As Acvr1 expression is profoundly increased in axotomized DRG
neurons in a traditional preclinical model of neuropathic pain produced by spared nerve injury (SNI), we found
that inhibiting injury-induced active neuronal ACVR1 signaling in the DRG by intrathecal (IT) injections of a
small-molecule ACVR1/ALK2 kinase inhibitor prevented injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and, most
importantly, reversed persistent pain in the mouse SNI model. Based on our observation that trauma-induced
HO triggered massive nociceptor sprouting at the injury site in a preclinical mouse model of FOP, we further
hypothesize that active ACVR1 signaling in sensory neurons is a critical link between neuropathic pain and
HO. Together, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms downstream of active ACVR1 signaling, mechanisms that
may be shared by other chronic pain and musculoskeletal injury conditions; while developing new treatment
strategies, we will define molecular targets of sensory neuron-specific ACVR1 that contribute to neuropathic
pain (Aim 1); validate if inhibiting peripheral neuronal ACVR1 reduces hypersensitivity (Aim 2); and determine
if sensory neuron-specific ACVR1 contributes to injury-induced HO (Aim 3)."

means to control specific biological processes for therapeutic intervention. Unfortunately, owing to their flat and
large interfaces, PPIs are challenging targets for traditional small molecule drugs. Cyclic peptides represent a
promising solution to target PPIsthey can directly mimic the binding functionalities at the PPIs and have
enhanced biostability and bioavailability compared to their linear counterparts. However, there are only ~50 cyclic
peptide drugs. Most are simply natural products or their derivatives, rather than deriving from successful de novo
cyclic peptide development. A major reason why the design of novel, functional cyclic peptides has proven
difficult is the need to simultaneously optimize multiple drug-related properties of cyclic peptides, e.g., binding
affinity, water solubility, and membrane permeability. Because cyclic peptides often have ≤12 residues and are
connected in a ring, even changing one amino acid can dramatically alter the properties of cyclic peptides.
Hence, changing cyclic peptide sequences to optimize for one property often negatively impacts other properties.
Machine learning (ML), now widely used to build predictive models for drug properties, holds enormous potential
to guide successful cyclic peptide design. Unfortunately, the few attempts at ML models to predict cyclic peptide
properties perform quite poorly. The core challenge is that most cyclic peptides, including the current cyclic
peptide drugs, adopt multiple conformations in water. It is, therefore, difficult for ML models to decipher how
sequence modifications impact the complicated structural ensembles of cyclic peptides, which in turn influence
their properties. If we can provide the ML models with this missing structural information, we will greatly improve
their performance in predicting cyclic peptide properties.
 Since no robust experimental methods are available to characterize and quantify the conformations in a
cyclic peptide structural ensemble, computational chemistry represents a logical alternative. Although recent
work has revealed that explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is capable of providing high-quality
structural predictions of cyclic peptides, it is far too slow to be used at scale. On the other hand, computational
methods that provide speedy predictions for cyclic peptide structural ensembles are inaccurate.
 Our long-term objective is a reliable, robust, and user-friendly platform for the computational design of
potent, bioavailable cyclic peptides targeting PPIs. In our first aim, we use explicit-solvent MD results of diverse

preserving both accuracy and speed. In our second aim, we use these high-quality structural ensembles as a
new descriptor for ML inputs to enable the training of high-performing ML models to predict cyclic peptide
properties. In our third aim, we demonstrate that these new computational platforms allow us to develop potent
cyclic peptide protein binders and PPI inhibitors."

10920478,"Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, predicts for morbidity, mortality and
excessive healthcare costs. Other than exercise, lifestyle therapies for slowing the progression of sarcopenia
in older men and women remain elusive. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common mechanistic link between
aging and many pathological factors contributing to sarcopenia. We propose to test whether supplementing
the diet with an oil rich linoleic acid (LA; 18:2n6), the preferred fatty acyl constituent of cardiolipin, improves
muscle strength and physical mobility. In mice, dietary LA-rich oil increases LA-rich cardiolipin (e.g., 4-LA-
cardiolipin) and mitochondrial respiration. Therefore, the effect of LA-rich oil to increase 4-LA-cardiolipin and
mitochondrial respiration in older people with sarcopenia will be measured evaluated. Because LA is a
required nutrient for humans, e.g., an essential fatty acid that must be attained in the diet, dietary sources are
the sole method to replenish LA for cardiolipin, the signature phospholipid of inner mitochondrial membranes.
In a phase II double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, this study will test the effect of LA-oil supplementation
to change muscle strength, physical mobility, 4-LA-cardiolipin and mitochondrial function. Identifying a
mechanistic link between LA and mitochondrial capacity could aid in the development of mechanistically
targeted therapies to slow or stop the progression of sarcopenia as well as other mitochondrial-related
conditions that develop in older adults."

 It is estimated that ~500,000 (34%) pediatric hospital stays each year in the United States (US) are
designated as outpatient under “observation status” and often referred to as observation stays. The concept of
observation status was created, initially, as a clinical designation, primarily for Emergency Department (ED)
clinicians to “observe” the patient for a period of time to determine the need for inpatient care (e.g., inpatient
admission). Over the past three decades, observation status has evolved and now is used as an administrative
assignment for patients who have a “short-term” hospital stay, typically falling “under the 2-midnight rule,” as
originally defined for Medicare patients and now widely adopted by commercial insurers and Medicaid
agencies. Our team recently found that observation stays are now common for pediatric hospital stays,
especially for children undergoing surgery. For example, more than 50% of pediatric post-appendectomy
admissions at Children's Hospitals were billed as observation stays in 2019. Studies from adult patients have
found significant impact of omitting observation stay data on quality measures and financial implications of
observation stays on patient Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) costs, yet there is a paucity of information about the impact
and implications on pediatric patients. To fill the crucial knowledge gaps, we propose a retrospective
observational study entitled Outcomes and Affordability of Observation Status for Children (OASIS) to
characterize the shift in observation stay assignment of pediatric patients, evaluate the impact of omitting
observation stay data on Pediatric Quality Indicators (QIs), and assess OOP costs for pediatric observation
stays. We focus on Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Pediatric QIs and propose to
evaluate the impact of omitting observation stay data on these QIs using Healthcare Cost and Utilization
Project state specific databases from 2010 through 2019. Specifically, we will quantify the overall and specific
trends in observation stay assignment by patient characteristic (e.g., race/ethnicity), evaluate the impact of
omitting observation stay data on the Pediatric QIs, and examine if there are any disparities in the trends and
QIs calculations. We also propose to assess OOP costs for pediatric observation stays by leveraging claims
data from statewide All-Payer Claims Databases and Optum. We will first characterize unexpected OOP cost
components that are typically covered by inpatient insurance benefits, such as medications, and identify
conditions for which OOP costs are higher as an observation stay than as an inpatient stay. The OASIS study
will provide pediatric specific evidence to refine quality measures, to develop advice for patients to recognize
financial implications of observation stays on OOP costs, and to inform future policies to protect patients in
observation stays from paying more than they would as inpatients."

Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread -herpesvirus that is the leading infectious cause of
congenital birth defects and causes coronary and other health problems in adults, as well as serious
complications in immunosuppressed transplant recipients or AIDS patients. Despite this, there is no vaccine or
cure, and we continue to have a relatively limited understanding of several unique aspects of HCMV
replication. Unlike most other viruses, HCMV has a protracted replication cycle that spans several days. During
this time HCMV forms a unique cytoplasmic structure termed the Assembly Compartment (AC). While fixed
imaging approaches provided insights into its organization, revealing that it comprises a remodeled Golgi
surrounded by various host vesicles, in the prior award period we developed innovative multi-color live cell
imaging approaches that revealed the dynamic behavior of the AC. In doing so, we revealed that the AC not
only acts as a virion maturation site but also serves as a Golgi-derived microtubule organizing center (MTOC)
that enables HCMV to generate acetylated microtubules (MTs). Our imaging approaches further revealed a
temporal series of events whereby HCMV rotates the nucleus for several days, after which time infected cells
become motile. Acetylation provides the mechanical strength for AC-derived MT filaments to rotate the
nucleus, with connections to the nuclear membrane being formed by the dynein adaptor, Bicaudal D2 (BICD2)
and SUN1, a component of the nuclear membrane-spanning Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton
(LINC) complex. Rotation of the nucleus is symptomatic of the extreme pulling forces that MTs and dynein
exert on SUN2-LINC complexes, polarizing them towards the AC. This in turn polarizes the actin-regulatory
protein, Emerin inside the nucleus and drives the formation of transient nuclear actin filaments. Using both
RNAi-mediated targeting and dominant-negatives to each individual component in this newly identified chain
connecting the AC all the way to nuclear actin, combined with the development of artificial intelligence-based
neural networks for large scale, automated image analysis, we revealed that MT-based connections to the
nuclear surface remodel the intranuclear environment in order to segregate viral genomic DNA from host
heterochromatin. In additional preliminary data, approaches such as transient transcriptomic sequencing (TT-
Seq) reveal that MT-based nuclear rotation serves to control specific host gene expression programs
associated with actin regulation, cell attachment and motility. Furthermore, blocking MT-based nuclear rotation
prevents HCMV from downregulating “actin caps”, which form through distinct SUN2-based LINC complexes
and serve to anchor the nucleus in place. Finally, additional data reveals the remarkably deformable nature of
the HCMV nucleus and supports a central hypothesis, tested here, that HCMV establishes a cytoskeletal
mechano-transduction pathway that releases actin caps that anchor the nucleus place, allowing MTs to then
remodel nuclear architecture and gene expression programs to promote cell motility and virus spread."

High-quality care throughout the trajectory of illness of Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-
related dementias (AD/ADRD) has been shown to be associated with a better quality of life, lower caregiver
distress, and reduced use of acute and long-term care. However, racial and ethnic (R&E) minoritized persons
with AD/ADRD often receive poorer quality care than White patients, including lower rates of advance
directives, reduced receipt of anti-dementia medications, and increased end-of-life hospitalizations. Although
governmental and institutional policies influence R&E diversity in medical education/training and work
environments, little is known about how R&E diversity in medical education, residency training, and health
system leadership affect R&E disparities in AD/ADRD care. This knowledge gap has hindered efforts to
develop interventions that could effectively eliminate disparities in AD/ADRD care. The proposed study will
address these important knowledge gaps by applying the quasi-experimental methods to the comprehensive
data on patients, physicians, medical schools, residency programs, and health systems we will develop by
linking 7 nationally-representative databases (Medicare Claims Data, Consumer Assessment of Healthcare
Providers and Systems Data, Doximity Physician Data, Association of American Medical Colleges Medical
School Data, American Medical Association Residency Program Data, RAND Health System Data, and
American Hospital Association National Health Care Governance Survey Data). In Aim 1, we will determine
the effect of the R&E diversity of medical school student bodies from which physicians graduated on disparities
in AD/ADRD care, by applying the quasi-experimental instrumental variable method using the state affirmative
action bans as an instrument. The state affirmative action bans serve as an ideal instrument because they are
strongly associated with medical school student body diversity, but do not directly affect AD/ADRD care. In
Aim 2, we will determine the effect of 4 residency program characteristics (higher R&E diversity of residents,
presence of cultural competence awareness program, instruction in medical Spanish or other non-English
languages, and rotation at the county and safety-net hospitals) on R&E disparity in AD/ADRD care, using the
propensity score matching method. In Aim 3, we will determine the effect of R&E diversity of health system
boards on disparities in AD/ADRD care, by applying the propensity score matching method. This project will
provide a robust evidence base for policymakers to develop policy interventions (e.g., increasing R&E diversity
and introducing the cultural competency awareness program at medical schools, residency programs, and
health systems) that could effectively mitigate R&E disparities in AD/ADRD care. The research team consists
of investigators with expertise in all relevant fields (Alzheimer's disease and dementia research, R&E disparity
research, medical education and training, organizational behaviors, physician and health system performance,
and econometric and statistical methods) to conduct this innovative research."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a naturally antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogen that causes severe and deadly
acute and chronic infections, particularly in compromised individuals. New therapeutics are needed to treat such
infections, as P. aeruginosa is often resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Recently, phage therapy has
reemerged as an approach to treat infections caused by P. aeruginosa. The advantage of phages is that they
can specifically lyse target bacteria. However, phages replicate and can potentially transfer genetic material
including antibiotic resistance or virulence genes from one bacterium to another. Instead of phages, we propose
to test the efficacy of the bacteriocins, R-pyocins, as therapeutic agents to treat P. aeruginosa infections.
Bacteriocins are antimicrobials produced by a bacterium that are active against the same species. R-pyocins
are specifically produced by P. aeruginosa and are related to the contractile tail of P2 bacteriophages, but lack
the phage head structure, have no nucleic acids, and thus cannot replicate. R-pyocins can be grouped into three
subtypes (R1, R2, and R5) that differ based on their binding to specific sites on the P. aeruginosa
lipopolysaccharide structure. Despite the apparent efficacy of R-pyocins against many P. aeruginosa in vitro,
there have been relatively few studies validating R-pyocins in mouse models of infection and only a single
published study has been reported using a murine model of lung infection. The goal of this new NIH
Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant Award (R21 Grant) is to assess P. aeruginosa susceptibility to R-
pyocins under in vitro conditions that mimic the lung environment and also in an acute mouse respiratory model
of infection. We hypothesize that R-pyocin susceptibility testing in this more infection-relevant growth
environment will provide a better indication of true susceptibility and testing additional isolates in vivo will provide
the much-needed justification for further consideration of R-pyocins as therapeutics agents."

The last decade has seen a significant increase in the number of FDA approved treatments for men
with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Even greater improvements in survival
were observed for men with metastatic castration sensitive PC (mCSPC) treated with chemotherapy or
androgen receptor signaling inhibitors compared to hormone therapy alone (Despite these advances
in mCSPC, median OS for men with mCRPC remains less than two years and cross-resistance to
therapies within the same class (e.g. Enzalutamide and Abiraterone) occurs in >90% of patients, limiting
effective treatments in mCRPC to agents with OS improvements ranging from only 2-4 months. There
is a critical need to identify new agents that can eliminate resistant disease5. Understanding the
molecular associations driving resistance may identify new therapeutic sensitivities in these aggressive
cancers to improve quality and quantity of life for men with mCRPC. Translational research studies
focused on understanding the underlying mechanisms driving treatment resistance in CRPC have
identified a wide range of genomic, epigenomic and transcriptional alterations. Approximately 15-20%
of patients with mCRPC develop lineage plasticity, with small cell neuroendocrine CRPC (SCNPC)
representing the most aggressive subtype. However, the field lacks consensus definitions for the
diverse lineage plasticity phenotypes observed in mCRPC, and few therapeutic targets have been
developed to date. In this study, we propose Trop-2 (Trophoblastic cell-surface antigen) as a high value
target for therapy of mCRPC with an antibody-drug conjugate Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG). We
hypothesize that ARSI-resistant phenotypes in mCRPC can be identified through integrated solid
tumor and liquid biopsy analysis and targeted therapeutically with SG. To test this hypothesis, we
propose to study Trop-2 regulation in pre-clinical and clinical specimens and test this agent in a
prospective Phase II clinical trial for ARSI-resistant mCRPC. In Aim 1, we will conduct molecular-spatial
analysis of Trop-2 expression in mCRPC PDX tissues as well as solid tumor and liquid biopsies from
patients with CSPC, CRPC and SCNPC In Aim 2, we will evaluate solid tumor and liquid biopsies
collected longitudinally from patients with mCRPC treated with SG in a prospective Phase II trial. Aim
2 will characterize chromatin enhancer profiles in the TACSTD2 gene encoding Trop-2 to identify
factors regulating Trop-2 levels in prostate cancer. We will test if Trop-2 levels determine sensitivity to
SG therapy, and identify SG-based combination regimens that enhance therapeutic efficacy in vitro
and in vivo."

Osteoarthritis affects approximately 30 million people in the United States and is the leading cause of pain and
disability among older adults. Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is among the most common elective surgery for
patients with refractory knee and hip arthritis. Although a proportion of patients achieve benefits from TJA, up to
34% of patients develop chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) following the procedure, with approximately 33% of
patients experiencing high impact or bothersome pain. While risk factors underlying CPSP following TJA have
been well documented, the mechanisms of resilience that predict treatment success are poorly characterized
and not routinely assessed. Building on prior research, we propose a novel conceptual model of pain resilience
that defines resilient functioning as a dynamic and multidimensional process that engages numerous systems,
a concept referred to as multisystem pain resilience (MSPR). In our preliminary work, we have found that
individuals with a greater degree of protective resources across multiple domains (i.e., psychological, social,
health) exhibit more optimal psychological, physical, and pain-related functioning when compared to those with
a lower resilient phenotype. Thus, investigating a broad range of adaptive factors may provide important
predictive insights into the unique combination of resources that account for resilient response trajectories
following TJA. In line with the Precision Medicine Initiative, the aims of this prospective observational study are
to explore mechanisms associated with treatment response in patients undergoing knee and hip arthroplasty,
and to characterize associations between MSPR phenotypic profiles with pain impact and physical function
trajectories. To address this goal, 300 patients ages 18+ years undergoing knee and hip arthroplasty will undergo
prospective assessments of MSPR factors and outcomes at baseline and at five postsurgical time points over a
9-month period. Patients will complete measures across the following MSPR domains comprised of modifiable
factors associated with pain: 1) demographic, 2) health, 3) biological, 4) behavioral, 5) psychological, and 6)
sociological. Collectively, these aims have the potential to advance understanding of phenotypic mechanisms
underlying postsurgical pain impact and physical function trajectories and may be a step toward the development
of therapeutic modalities aimed at promoting enhanced recovery and reducing overall pain burden in patients
undergoing arthroplasty."

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is an objective, non-invasive, measure of the integrated function of
the pulmonary, cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems. CPET evaluates submaximal and peak exercise
responses, informing on causes of dyspnea and/or fatigue, disease prognosis and/or progression, pre- or post-
surgical risk stratification, or exercise training prescription. Clinical use of CPET is estimated to have increased
by 81% between 2005 and 2015. The most common problem for CPET interpretation is discriminating between
cardiovascular disease and neuromuscular deconditioning e.g., low muscle mass, weakness and/or fatigability.
We have developed a solution to this problem, using a modified CPET with integrated isokinetic (IK)
measurements of muscle power, which independently assesses neuromuscular performance without
affecting measurement of standard CPET variables. The modified CPET adds <10min to the standard CPET
and uses commercially available equipment. The modified CPET produces 4 new IK variables: 1) Baseline peak
isokinetic power: deconditioned muscles are weak; 2) Tolerance index: the fraction of peak IK power at
V̇O2peak. Aerobic deconditioning reduces the available peak IK power that can be supported by aerobic
metabolism; 3) Fatigue index: The loss of peak IK power for a given work rate. Aerobic deconditioning increases
fatigability; 4) Power reserve: The capacity for acute power increase at V̇O2peak. A power reserve indicates that
neuromuscular performance is not limiting to exercise tolerance. The modified CPET is reproducible and well
tolerated by elderly, normal subjects and athletes, and those with heart failure or COPD. The modified CPET
can differentiate neuromuscular deconditioning as a cause of exercise limitation from cardiovascular or
pulmonary limitations (assessed by standard CPET). To inform clinical interpretation, this project will develop
predictive models describing normal reference values for IK variables in men and women aged 18-80yr.
Threshold values of neuromuscular performance (with corresponding sensitivity and specificity) will be
developed and optimized to discriminate a deconditioned population. Variables that moderate neuromuscular
performance measures associated with deconditioning will be identified (e.g. V̇O2peak, diastolic dysfunction,
vascular reactivity, leg lean mass, leg strength and power, muscle oxidative capacity and muscle biopsy
morphology). Finally, the discriminative ability of IK variables for deconditioning will be tested by measuring
sensitivity of IK variables in response to exercise training in deconditioned individuals and the specificity of IK
variables to discriminate peripheral vs. central hemodynamic exercise limitations using invasive CPET in patients
with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. This study will transform the utility and diagnostic capabilities
of CPET and improve clinical decision-making and severity stratification across a wide range of chronic disease
states where deconditioning is a common feature."

Structural remodeling of synapses and circuits is essential to experience-dependent plasticity, as occurs during
the consolidation of learned experiences into long-term memory. Immune dysfunction has been implicated in
numerous cognitive disorders, including schizophrenia and neurodegenerative diseases, leading to increasing
interest in the function of brain-resident macrophages known as microglia, which are the dominant immune cell
in the brain parenchyma. We previously published that the IL-1 family cytokine Interleukin-33, which is made by
astrocytes during development, signals to its obligate receptor IL1RL1 expressed on microglia to promote
microglial activation and phagocytic function. In preliminary data that forms the basis for this proposal, we identify
a novel population of IL-33 expressing neurons in two adult brain regions: hippocampus and frontal cortex. In
detailed structural analyses in the hippocampus, we find that neuron-specific deletion of IL-33 or microglial-
specific deletion of IL-33 R leads to fewer dendritic spines, diminished markers of spine plasticity known as spine
head filopodia, and impaired neurogenesis. Furthermore, loss of this signaling pathway leads to deficits in
contextual fear conditioning: mice are able to normally learn to recognize a fear context but have a progressive
decrease in their ability to discriminate the fear context from a neutral context emerging at 15-30 days post
training. Mechanistically, we find that extracellular matrix proteins (the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans brevican
and aggrecan) accumulate in the hippocampus of IL-33 deficient animals. We find that microglia engulf aggrecan,
and that loss of IL-33 signaling diminishes this engulfment. We also developed a neuronal gain of function
construct that constitutively secretes IL-33. We find this is sufficient to increase hippocampal spine numbers,
microglial ECM engulfment, and to clear ECM around dendritic spines. Based on these preliminary data, this
proposal will test the central hypothesis that neuron-derived IL-33 drives microglial remodeling of ECM to
promote circuit plasticity in support of memory consolidation. Aim One will explore the molecular regulation of
IL-33 release from neurons and its activity dependence, and test two candidate proteases mediating microglial
remodeling in response to IL-33. Aim Two will test the impact of this neuron-microglia signaling on the ECM
composition of the frontal cortex with a focus on perineuronal nets and determine its impact on connectivity of
the cortical microcircuit. Aim 3 will use calcium imaging in a contextual fear conditioning task to test how neuronal
activity patterns shift during the transition from recent to remote memories, addressing key questions regarding
the structural changes that underlie memory consolidation. Together, these studies will systematically dissect
the role of a novel cellular circuit regulating plasticity in the healthy brain. The outcome of this work has
implications for understanding cognitive dysfunction in numerous diseases linked to microglia and the immune
system , including schizophrenia and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease."
10734772,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Homologous recombination (HR), a pathway that repairs DNA double strand breaks (DSB), is frequently
mutated in cancers. HR-deficient cancers are prone to genomic instability and are critically dependent on other
DNA repair mechanisms for survival. Among them is the DNA damage sensor PARP, and PARP inhibitors have
therefore proved an efficient therapy to eliminate HR-deficient cancers. However, some HR-deficient tumors do
not respond to PARP inhibitors, and most tumors eventually relapse and become resistant to the drug. New
therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently needed to treat HR-deficient cancers and overcome PARP
inhibitor resistance. Among the potential strategies, growing attention has focused on alternative end-joining (Alt-
EJ), a back-up DSB repair pathway that is dispensable in normal cells but critical to cellular survival when HR is
compromised. While mounting evidence suggests that inhibition of Alt-EJ could be a powerful strategy to
overcome the problem of resistance to PARP inhibitors, the Alt-EJ pathway remains poorly characterized, limiting
the potential number of therapeutic targets that could be developed.
 To address this gap in knowledge, my lab has designed a novel approach to identify Alt-EJ factors using
genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Using this method as well as Alt-EJ assays based on repair reporters or
Alt-EJ-mediated fusion of telomeres, we have identified the nuclease APE2 as a critical protein in Alt-EJ. This
compelling discovery raises the exciting possibility that APE2 inhibition could be used to specifically target HR-
deficient cancer cells, and thereby prevent or overcome resistance to PARP inhibitors. Several questions
however need to be addressed first, as the exact function of APE2 in Alt-EJ and its role in HR-deficient cells
remain elusive.
 First, we will characterize, at the molecular level, the function and mechanism of action of APE2 in Alt-EJ.
We will determine: (1) the role of APE2 in Alt-EJ, (2) the domains and biochemical activities involved, and (3)
the mechanism of its recruitment to DSBs. The interest here is both to significantly improve our fundamental
understanding of the Alt-EJ repair pathway and to gain sufficient knowledge on APE2 to enable the future
development of an inhibitor.
 Second, we will uncover the therapeutic potential of APE2 inhibition in HR-deficient cancer cells. (1) We
will identify the repair function of APE2 that drives its synthetic lethality with HR, and (2) we will determine the
potential of APE2 inhibition to synergize with PARP inhibitors and to prevent or overcome resistance to PARP
inhibitors.
 Our novel discovery that APE2 plays a critical function in alternative end-joining, and the innovative tools
that we have created to study APE2’s role in Alt-EJ places my lab in a unique position to successfully carry out
this proposed research."

 An African origin for modern humans and the vast genetic diversity in the region is irrefutable. Within
Africa, southern Africa is home to the some of the oldest and most diverse extant human populations world-wide.
These populations, the KhoeSan, reside predominantly in the north-western parts of South Africa and throughout
Namibia and Botswana. In previous work (PMID 27474727), I and two of my mentors showed that fine-scale
genetic population structure between these KhoeSan populations reflects ecogeographical boundaries. In
addition to this unique KhoeSan ancestry, populations in southern Africa have been shaped by numerous
migrations from within Africa (e.g. Bantu-speaking peoples) and outside Africa (notably European and Asian
populations). Thus, the patterns of diversity observed in this area is unique with no comparable regions
elsewhere in the world. These southern African populations went on to further adapt to their new environment
which was plagued by disease, resource limitations and harsh climates. The role of positive selection in this
adaption, remains unknown.
 Using one of the largest whole genome sequencing dataset collections encompassing numerous
southern African populations, we aim to: 1) scan these datasets for signals of positive selection and 2) evaluate
the functional, biological and potentially translational implications of these signals. This project will be the largest
and most comprehensive single study of natural selection on the African continent. The methods developed in
this study will inform future scans for natural selection in heterogenous, admixed African populations.
Furthermore, the findings will provide insights into how adaptation to the environment has shaped human
genomes and in turn, various phenotypes in this unique part of Africa - these results could be informative to all
populations with African ancestry."
10861921,"Sepsis is a devastating disorder and a leading cause of death in the US. Prior studies have
focused mainly on its hyper-inflammatory state and yet anti-inflammatories for sepsis have not
shown benefit. Mounting data suggest that immune suppression partakes in this disorder, the
molecular mechanisms of which remain unclear. This application investigates a unique
molecular model whereby we discovered an immunosuppressive protein called Fbxo24, that
disposes of a mitochondrial synthetic protein, called DARS2, that is indispensable for critical
cytoprotective functions of epithelia including innate immune function and preservation of cell
proliferative activity. Our hypothesis is that Fbxo24, in part, mediates immunosuppression
in experimental sepsis through ubiquitin-mediated degradation of DARS2, a secreted
protein essential for host epithelial cell innate immune and reparative responses. Hence,
in this application we will first elucidate if Fbxo24 targets DARS2 for its ubiquitin-mediated
proteolysis in experimental sepsis (Aim 1). We will specifically elucidate the biologic relevance
of reduced Fbxo24 levels in preclinical models of sepsis and organ injury as an immune
suppressor using gene transfer in our Fbxo24 knockout mice and the mechanisms by which
Fbxo24 mediates DARS2 ubiquitination and degradation in a site-specific manner. Next, we
will determine if DAR2 is a crucial extracellular host defense protein in experimental sepsis
(Aim 2). Here we will elucidate mechanistically how DARS2 is essential to maintain innate
immune responses and cell proliferative activity through its regulated secretion from epithelia
in vitro and in vivo. We will employ complementary murine and 2-hit models of immune
suppression and an ex vivo isolated human lung system. These studies will provide a new
pathobiologic model of immune dysregulation. This work serves as a platform for generating
genetically engineered proteolytically stable DARS2 proteins that optimize epithelial
cytoprotective functions in subjects with severe immune suppression in critical illness."

Adipocytes play a key role in energy homeostasis, storing energy in the form of triglyceride (TG). In addition to
neutral lipids, adipocytes contain abundant free cholesterol derived from circulating HDL cholesterol. There is a
strong positive correlation between adipocyte cholesterol content and TG content, suggesting mechanistic
linkage between adipocyte cholesterol and TG regulation. However, how adipocyte cholesterol is modulated by
HDL cholesterol, and if and how cholesterol homeostasis in adipocytes influences TG accumulation are
unknown. Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI, encoded by SCARB1) is a high-affinity HDL receptor that
is abundant in adipocytes. We recently discovered that mice selectively deficient in SR-BI in adipocytes (SR-
BI∆AD) are protected from high fat diet-induced adiposity, their adipocytes are smaller, and they have decreased
white adipose tissue (WAT) HDL cholesterol uptake and cellular cholesterol content. The overall goal of the
project is to elucidate how HDL cholesterol and SR-BI influence adipocyte TG content, and to determine if
adipocyte SR-BI expression is genetically regulated in humans to potentially impact the risk of obesity. Three
Aims will be pursued in novel mouse models and cultured human adipocytes. Aim 1 will determine if HDL
cholesterol and SR-BI promote adipocyte TG accumulation through transcriptional regulation of genes that
control lipid homeostasis. We have determined that in SR-BI∆AD WAT the expression of liver X receptor β (LXRβ)
and its target genes is downregulated and the content of oxysterols, which are LXR ligands, is decreased. Aim
1 will test the hypothesis that via HDL cholesterol uptake, adipocyte SR-BI promotes TG accumulation by
providing the substrate for Cyp27a1 which converts cholesterol to oxysterols, leading to upregulation of LXRβ
and its target genes. Aim 2 will determine if HDL cholesterol and SR-BI promote adipocyte TG accumulation by
supporting adipocyte free fatty acid (FFA) uptake, which occurs in caveolae, which are cholesterol-rich plasma
membrane domains. By electron microscopy we have discovered that caveolae content is markedly decreased
in SR-BIAD adipocytes. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that SR-BI-mediated HDL cholesterol uptake promotes
FFA uptake and subsequent TG accumulation by supporting caveolae formation and maintenance. Aim 3 will
determine how adipocyte SR-BI expression is transcriptionally regulated in humans, and if there is a genetic
predisposition to obesity related to adipocyte SR-BI expression. Using a novel deep learning algorithm, we have
identified a potential distal enhancer for SCARB1 within a region on Chr 12 harboring SNPs highly associated
with obesity. In cultured human adipocytes, CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of the candidate region decreases SR-BI
expression. Using further mutagenesis and interrogation of transcription factor binding sites, we will test the
hypothesis that there is a remote enhancer of SCARB1 that harbors SNPs that influence the risk of obesity by
their impact on adipocyte SR-BI expression. Collectively the proposed studies will reveal fundamental processes
by which HDL cholesterol and SR-BI govern adipocyte function and thereby impact the development of obesity."

 This R01 (PA-20-185) application aims to greatly improve basic science understanding of oligodendrocytes
with respect to spatial and temporal dynamic changes around chronically implanted microelectrodes and long-
term recording performance. Penetrating recording microelectrode arrays are a crucial component of
numerous human neuroprosthetics. Obtaining selective, high fidelity, long-lasting readouts of brain activity is a
critical technology across basic and applied neuroscience that impacts motor, pre-motor, and visual cortex
neuroprostheses and brain-computer interfaces. However, implantation of cortical microelectrodes causes a
reactive tissue response, which results in a degradation of the preferred functional single-unit performance
over time, thus limiting the device capabilities. While the BBB and the role of other glial cells like microglia and
astrocytes have long been studied with respect to the degradation of chronic recording performance, the role of
oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor in this foreign body response has been understudied.
 This proposal aims to characterize the role of oligodendrocytes and chronic recording failure in vivo caused
by the insertion via quantifying structural, cellular, and molecular level tissue response to chronic implants in
the brain in real time through combining multiphoton imaging technology and neural engineering technology at
the University of Pittsburgh. A dynamic understanding of the interfaces is necessary for elucidating the
mechanism(s) behind neural recording failure. Oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells have
been implicated as key players in neuronal health following brain injury and numerous neurodegenerative
diseases. Therefore, we will utilize transgenic animals with specific activity indicators in oligodendrocytes as
well as pharmaceutical and gliomodulation approaches that target oligodendrocytes in order to explore
mechanisms that improve oligodendrocyte health and chronic intracortical recording performance. This work
has the potential to output basic and clinical science level knowledge relevant to neural engineering, ischemia,
stroke, intracortical hemorrhage, aneurysm, traumatic brain injury, MS, ALS, and closed-loop neurostimulation."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is a life-threatening metabolic disease that increases TB incidence and
mortality in South Africa and Worldwide. Dysregulation of glucose homeostasis leads to the development of
hyperglycaemia. Amongst newly diagnosed T2DM patients, hyperglycaemia is associated with TB/T2DM co-
morbidity. Sustained hyperglycaemia results in enhanced sensitivity to Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) in
vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. IGF-1 influence the innate immune system and predominantly
produced by monocytes/macrophages after hepatocytes. We have identified a transcriptomic signature of
increased IGF-1 in IL-4-stimulated macrophages in TB infection. Others have shown that IGF-1 facilitates
alternative activation and ablation of macrophage-IGF-1R hampers the inflammasome activation to reduce
chronic inflammation. Clinical studies revealed that high IGF-1 levels increased the risk of T2DM and increased
serum IGF-1 levels in patients with TB and TB/T2DM. These studies represent significant advances in our
understanding of IGF-1 and suggest altered immunometabolism in host immunity influencing the outcome of TB,
T2DM and TB/T2DM. However, there is still much work that needs to be done as immunometabolic and
immunogenetic regulations in IGF-1 signalling remain unknown in TB and TB/T2DM and a burden in Africa.
A better further understanding of the IGF-1 signalling-mediated dysregulation of immunometabolism and
immunogenetics could inform new biomarkers for diagnostics and improve treatment options for patients with
TB, T2DM and TB/T2DM. I hypothesize that IGF-1 immunometabolism increases the risk of TB, T2DM and
TB/T2DM co-morbidity. To test this, I propose a comprehensive career development plan comprising structured
activities and mentorship opportunities to determine the function of IGF-1 by acquiring advanced skills in (1)
metabolic studies in patient samples; (2) bioinformatics to identify genetic variants in clinical datasets and
functional interrogations in primary human macrophages; (3) assess an IGF-1R inhibitor as adjunctive therapy
in the C3HeB/FeJ mice.
The research proposed is highly relevant to regional/global health priorities, and the career development of the
PI. The project PI, Dr Suraj Parihar, is an immunologist at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, that wants
to conduct research that will improve life quality of patients having grown up in India and seen first-hand the
impact of TB as a significant public health problem.
This K43 award will position him to build an independent program of research and establish a unique scientific
niche in macrophage immunometabolism and immunogenetics that drives innovative diagnostic and therapeutic
approaches for patients in developing world."
10930102,"ABSTRACT
A central challenge of the post-genomic era is to comprehensively characterize the cellular role of the ~20,000
proteins encoded in the human genome. For this purpose, we have developed the FP11 tags and a high-
efficiency CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing pipeline, enabling large-scale generation of endogenously tagged human
cell lines, and paying the way to proteome-wide analysis of protein localization and interaction networks in a
native cellular context. In the previously funded preject, we have established the cellular engineering platform
and demonstrated the power of such an approach in creating the OpenCell library (~1300 targeted proteins)
and its imaging and proteomics characterization. Still, technical challenges remain in long-term live imaging of
protein dynamics and quantitative interpretation of these movies. In the proposed renewal, we plan to further
develop the epi-illumination selective plane illumination microscopy (eSPIM) technique, turning it into a widely
applicable live cell microscopy platform for high-resolution, long-term imaging of subcellular dynamics with low
photobleaching and phototoxicity. We will also develop the corresponding software packages for instrument
control and image processing to enable its easy adoption by other labs. Finally, we will demonstrate the
applicability of this technological platform by screening for unusual protein dynamics through cell cycle using
the OpenCell library."
10900755,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mitochondria are endosymbiotically-derived double membrane-bound organelles which provide cells with
energy via oxidative respiration. Mitochondria also serve as a major hub for cellular metabolism and are
involved in numerous vital pathways, including cell signaling, innate immune response, and apoptosis.
Dysfunction of mitochondria is implicated in aging and many diseases and is a potential causative factor in
neurodegenerative diseases. Most of >1,000 mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and
thus are imported from the cytosol shortly after being synthesized as precursors on cytosolic ribosomes. Thus,
mitochondrial protein import is an essential process required for biogenesis and functional maintenance of
mitochondria. The import process is mainly mediated by two universally conserved membrane complexes, the
translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex and the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complex.
The TOM complex mediates the initial translocation of precursor proteins across the outer mitochondrial
membrane, and the TIM complex further translocates the precursor proteins across the inner mitochondrial
membrane. The TIM complex is also responsible for integration of many integral membrane proteins to the
inner membrane. Currently, it is poorly understood how the TOM and TIM complexes mediate these
translocation processes. In the current proposal, we aim to address central outstanding questions about
protein import mechanisms by the TOM and TIM complexes, using structural, biochemical, and biophysical
approaches. These questions include how the translocase complexes specifically recognize their client
proteins, how they form a path for protein translocation in the membranes, what are the molecular interactions
and forces driving protein translocation, and how the translocase complexes are regulated. In particular, we will
perform several cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies to visualize the translocase complexes in different
functional states, including substrate-engaged states, and gain insights into their mechanisms for substrate
engagement and conformational changes. The outcomes of these studies will fundamentally advance our
understanding of mitochondrial biology and provide new insights to develop novel approaches to treat
mitochondrial-associated diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases."
10914313,"Ca2+ signaling is a broadly conserved regulator of cell function, thus many viruses have evolved mechanisms to
exploit Ca2+ signaling pathways to promote viral replication. Rotavirus (RV), which remains the leading cause of
acute gastroenteritis and diarrheal deaths in children worldwide, is an archetypal example of this. RV infection
induces global increases in cytosolic Ca2+ which both disrupts host cell physiology and facilitates RV
replication. While global Ca2+ dysregulation has long been a hallmark of RV infection, the distinct types of signals
that sustain this dysregulation, and thereby facilitate replication and pathogenesis, have not been fully identified.
Recently, our lab resolved a novel RV-induced Ca2+ signal known as an intercellular Ca2+ wave (ICW), which is
critically linked to both viral exploitation and host restitution. ICWs are mediated by paracrine ADP release from
infected cells which binds to the P2Y1 receptor on neighboring cells, eliciting a cytosolic Ca2+ flux. Through this
mechanism, RV dysregulates Ca2+ not only in infected cells, but also in neighboring, uninfected cells. We found
that this P2Y1-mediated signal is critical to host responses that influence disease, including serotonin, chloride,
and fluid secretion, and the expression of immune mediators. In preliminary studies, we have also found that
ICWs enhance MAPK activation and stem cell markers, which contribute to restitution. However, inhibiting ICWs
reduces RV shedding, suggesting that ICWs also facilitate RV replication. Importantly, our preliminary data also
show that recombinant expression of RV non-structural protein 4 (NSP4), an endoplasmic reticulum localized
viral Ca2+ channel, is sufficient to induce ICWs. Given this, our Central Hypothesis is that aberrant Ca2+
signaling caused by RV NSP4 initiates ADP release triggering paracrine activation of P2Y1 to regulate
host epithelial responses to RV infection; however, RV exploits this P2Y1 signaling to prime surrounding
cells for greater replication. To test this hypothesis, we will (Aim 1) characterize the RV-induced ADP release
pathway from infected cells, (Aim 2) characterize the P2Y1-mediated proliferative and restitution responses to
RV infection in the gut, and (Aim 3) determine how RV co-opts P2Y1 signaling to increase virus replication and
spread. Given that a broad range of enteric pathogens disrupt Ca2+ signaling, completion of these aims will
generate new mechanistic insights into the host/pathogen arms race, new understanding of pathogen recognition
pathways, and identify new cellular targets for potentially broadly acting antiviral therapies."
10913620,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current pharmacological obesity treatments have limited long-term efficacy with little or no impact on disease
reversal. The proposed research focuses on the fact that the pathophysiology of obesity is driven by
dysregulation of multiple, but inter-related pathways. As such, we hypothesize that successful treatments for
obesity will require a new generation of therapeutics that target multiple receptors of complementary
neurocircuits regulating the controls of energy balance. While considerable interest has focused on
glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists alone, recent evidence also shows that Y1-R agonism facilitates trans-
differentiation of pancreatic α-cells to β-cells, thus increasing insulin secretion and reducing glucagon secretion,
while peripheral administration of the neuropeptide Y2-receptor (Y2-R) agonist PYY3-36 has been shown to
reduce caloric intake. We recently developed the first tri-agonist of GLP-1R, Y1-R and Y2-R (GEP44),
obtained after extensive studies in lean and DIO rodent (mice and rats) and mammalian (musk shrew) studies
of food intake, weight loss, glucose uptake, nausea, and emesis. GEP44 shows potent anorectic effects in lean
and diet-induced obese rats and mice in acute and chronic studies with up to 80 % reduction of food intake and
stronger reductions of body weight than known GLP-1RAs, including liraglutide, and without visceral malaise
(common to GLP-1RAs alone). We have shown GEP44 can penetrate the brainstem and bind to GLP-1R, and
Y-family receptors in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius, and facilitate glucose entry into muscle
via the Y1-R. Our success with this innovative triple agonism led us to further development and refinements of
monomeric peptides, including the development of a long-acting form, which we plan to test in vivo with this
project. To further test the simultaneous agonism of these three receptors, critical in glucoregulation, food intake,
and energy balance, we propose complimentary studies by a multi-PI team of established investigators with
extensive collaborative experience to investigate the following aims: Aim 1 will elucidate tissue-specific
synergism of tri- vs. single- receptor agonism and targets underlying the efficacy of GEP44 focusing on brain
areas of energy homeostasis. Included therein is an unbiased cell transcriptomics study to test the effects, on
brainstem circuitry, of GEP44 in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats. Furthermore, characteristics of different lipidated
long-acting analogs at two primary positions focusing on receptor agonism and binding, internalization, β-arrestin
recruitment, albumin binding, and proteolysis protection will be established in vitro. Aim 2 will focus on
pharmacokinetics and on testing long-acting GEP44 vs. GEP44 on energy expenditure, body weight change,
food intake, gastric emptying, and potential adverse effects to determine acute and chronic effects in rats. Aim
3 will establish the effects of long-acting GEP44 on post meal glucose levels, incretin independent insulin
secretion, insulin sensitivity, and on glucose uptake in diabetic obese rats. Such studies will lead to significantly
improved, clinically beneficial novel therapeutics for the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic disorders."

Mechanical interactions play a fundamental role in physiology, allowing cells to move, generate forces, and
assemble into multicellular structures. Key to these processes is the ability of cells to turn mechanical signals
into biochemical signals, an activity known as mechanotransduction. The search for mechanosensitive proteins
that could facilitate mechanotransduction has primarily focused on proteins that undergo conformational
changes in response to force or proteins that display changes in the bond kinetics under load. There exists
another class of proteins, however, that recognize structures under strain.
The canonical example of this class of proteins is the LIM domain protein zyxin, which recognizes strained
actin stress fibers and recruits actin polymerization factors to repair them. Recent work has highlighted that the
strain sensing mechanism of the LIM domains is not unique to zyxin and that numerous other members of the
family of LIM domain proteins display a similar ability. This suggests LIM domain proteins could act as
mechanotransducers, recognizing strain via their LIM domains and converting it to other biochemical signals
via interactions with the other domains in the protein. To explore this hypothesis further it is crucial that we
understand how LIM domains recognize strained actin filaments, and how those interactions propagate signals
downstream of the strain sites.
Here we propose to establish rigorous experimental strategies to decipher the mechanisms underlying LIM
domain protein mechanotransduction. We employ a combination of biophysical techniques including laser
ablations, optogenetics and cell stretching to quantitatively and repeatedly induce strain sites in the actin
cytoskeleton. In Aim 1 we will test alternative mechanisms of LIM domain strain sensing by comparing proteins
from the testin family of LIM domain proteins which require only a single LIM domain to recognize strain sites,
compared to the three tandem LIM domains that zyxin requires. In Aim 2 we will test whether in addition to
stretched actin filaments in stress fibers, LIM domain proteins can recognize other strained actin structures,
such as compressed stress fibers or actin meshworks. Finally, in Aim 3 we will investigate how binding of LIM
domain proteins to strain sites leads to a propagation of that mechanical signal to other parts of the stress fiber
and the extracellular matrix. Together these studies will greatly expand our knowledge of mechanotransduction
and provide insight into this fundamental signaling mechanism."
10897871,"The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multi-protein cytoplasmic complex functioning as a pattern
recognition receptor that has emerged as a key regulator of sterile inflammation and cell death.
NLRP3 activation leads to secretion of mature IL-1β and IL-18. Caspase 1 activation can also
initiate a distinct form of programmed cell death (pyroptosis) mediated via processing of
Gasdermin D and formation of discrete pores in the plasma membrane. Using single cell RNA
transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) we demonstrated that time-controlled, inducible global NLRP3
inflammasome activation results in 1) shifts in liver macrophages characterized by depletion of
KCs and infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages (MdMs); 2) liver infiltration with
proinflammatory neutrophils; 3) increased activated myofibroblastic HSCs; 4) an enhanced role
for NLRP3 inflammasome driven by IL-18; 5) These changes are associated with chronic
inflammation, increased collagen deposition and development of liver fibrosis. Based on our
published and novel preliminary data we propose the CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS that NLRP3
inflammasome regulated changes in the innate immune cell niche in the liver is a central
mechanism that triggers myofibroblastic HSC activation, and liver fibrosis driven by IL-18. To
investigate this hypothesis our proposal has following SPECIFIC AIMS. FIRST, we will determine
the mechanisms and consequences of KC depletion induced by NLRP3 activation. We will test
the hypothesis that NLRP3 inflammasome activation in KCs leads to pyroptotic cell death and
the recruitment of MdMs to the liver. We will use a number of unique, genetically engineered
mice. To study the effects of KC-specific loss of function of NLRP3 during NASH we will use our
new floxed Nlrp3-/- mice on a fat-fructose-cholesterol diet that mimics human fibrotic-NASH. In
vivo experiments will be complemented with ex vivo assays using purified KCs, iPSCs and sc-
RNA transcriptomics. SECOND, we will dissect the role of cell-specific IL-18 signaling pathways
in NLRP3 mediated HSC activation and liver fibrosis. We will test the hypothesis that NLRP3
inflammasome activation in neutrophils and MdMs, followed by IL-18 signaling pathway
activation is a central driver of HSC activation and liver fibrosis. We will characterize the role of
IL-18 signaling and identify novel downstream mediators responsible for liver fibrosis. We will
generate floxed IL-18, or IL-18R1, or IL-18BP murine lines to study IL-18 signaling in a cell-
specific manner using neutrophil or macrophage-specific, NLRP3-driven models. We will also
assess cell-specific modulation of NLRP3/IL-18 signaling in murine NASH-associated fibrosis in
vivo. Finally, we will investigate translational mechanisms targeting the IL-18 pathway in fibrotic
liver disease."

Despite the wide application of commonly used drugs for type 2 diabetes (T2D) treatment, the prevalence of
T2D continues to rise in the US. Insulin resistance and progressive decline in functional β-cell mass are two key
driving forces for T2D. Obesity is a leading pathogenic factor for developing T2D, which is a significant obstacle
for effective glycemic control in many patients with T2D. Thus, identifying novel agents that can simultaneously
ameliorate obesity and promote insulin sensitivity and β-cell function would be a more effective strategy for
preventing and treating T2D. In searching for agents with both anti-obesity and anti-hyperglycemic activities, we
found for the first time that elenolic acid (EA), a small molecule generated from hydrolyzing olive leaf-derived
oleuropein, is such a highly promising compound. Excitingly, oral administration of EA reversed hyperglycemia
while also promoting weight loss and suppressing food intake in obese diabetic mice, Notably, EA was more
effective in managing hyperglycemia and obesity than that of metformin. Interestingly, EA induced peptide YY
(PYY) and glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion from intestinal L-cells. In this grant, we propose to test
hypothesis that EA is a dual acting agent for simultaneous treatment of obesity and diabetes via triggering PYY
and GLP-1 secretion. Aim 1 will characterize the anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects of EA. In that regard, diet-
induced obese mice and obese diabetic db/db mice will receive EA treatment once daily via oral gavage. The
effects of EA on metabolic profiles of obese diabetic mice will be examined for determining its anti-obesity and
anti-diabetic efficacy. In addition, euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps in combination with ex vivo analyses of
peripheral tissues will be performed to examine the effects of EA on insulin action, fat metabolism, and
gluconeogenic programs. Immunohistochemistry will be carried out to analyze Islet β-cell mass and function.
Further, oral bioavailability, metabolism, and potential toxicity of EA will be studied. Lastly, mouse models with
T2D will be used to investigate the synergistic metabolic effects of EA plus metformin combination therapy. Aim
2 will identify the mechanisms by which EA suppresses food intake and protects against obesity. First, the effects
of EA on feeding responses and stomach emptying in mice will be evaluated, followed by ex vivo analyses of
hypothalamic pathway controlling food intake. Next, pair-feeding in combination with energy expenditure
analyses will be performed to examine the extent to which the anti-obesity efficacy of EA is driven by reduced
energy intake. Additionally, intracerebroventricular administration of pharmacological inhibitors targeting GLP-1
receptor (GLP-1R) or PYY receptor (Y2R) as well as the receptor null mice will be used to investigate whether
EA inhibition of food intake requires the central PYY/Y2R and/or GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling systems. The results
of this project are expected to defining the efficacy of a novel compound for treating both diabetes and obesity
as well as uncovering the mechanism underpinning these effects, which will potentially lead to developing new,
safe, and effective therapy for battling both diabetes and obesity."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has adapted to survive a wide range of assaults—from our immune response
to antimicrobial therapeutics—intended to eradicate the organism. However, the molecular switches that enable
Mtb to endure these stresses, to slow replication or to become dormant as a latent tuberculosis (TB) infection
are not known. Emerging studies on the molecular underpinnings of stress survival generally point to a major
role for toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, which are operons comprising adjacent genes encoding two small proteins,
a toxin and its cognate antitoxin that inhibits toxin activity in the TA protein-protein complex. However, several
bottlenecks have impeded progress toward rigorous testing of this provocative association. This proposal enlists
a strong multidisciplinary team with expertise in all core components of the proposed work—RNA-seq, TA
systems, Mtb biology/physiology and bioinformatics/computational biology. The genome-scale approach
developed in the PI’s laboratory, 5’ RNA-seq, will be used to overcome these obstacles as they apply to the
eleven-member MazE (antitoxin) – MazF (toxin) family in Mtb. 5’ RNA-seq will facilitate comprehensive detection
of MazF targets in the Mtb transcriptome under unstressed conditions or after exposure to stresses that are
relevant to latent TB infection. Finally, the impact of MazF toxins on the Mtb proteome will be investigated.
Collectively, these approaches will identify the environmental signals that trigger toxin activation in Mtb, provide
an accurate snapshot of RNAs targeted by MazF toxins under these metabolic states, and reveal clues to how
toxin-mediated RNA cleavage alters Mtb physiology. These goals align well with “Priority 1: Improve
Fundamental Knowledge of TB” of the five components of the NIAID Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis Research

 Compassionate end-of-life (EOL) care is foundational to medicine, but providing patients and families in
safety-net hospitals (SNHs) with the sense that they are physically and emotionally supported during a
patient’s terminal hospitalization can be challenging. SNHs are public hospitals that primarily provide services
to low-income and uninsured patients on a minimal budget. Although high quality EOL care is an important
unmet need in SNHs, its provision is fraught with barriers and challenges. Language barriers, low health
literacy, and cultural differences can make it difficult for families in SNHs to perceive empathy and support
during the EOL. Deaths in the intensive care unit (ICU) for underserved families can be traumatic, and families
of patients who die in the ICU often suffer from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Palliative care
interventions are needed, but implementation is often resource-prohibitive.
 The 3 Wishes Project (3WP) is a palliative care intervention that aims to achieve a dignified and
compassionate EOL experience by empowering the clinical team to elicit and fulfill small wishes for critically ill
patients who are dying in the ICU. Although the 3WP has been shown to improve a family’s experience of their
loved one’s EOL care, ease bereavement, and enhance clinician work satisfaction in academic centers, it has
not been implemented and evaluated in low-resource hospitals. We believe that this patient-centered and
clinician-partnered initiative can improve the EOL experience in SNHs, but that it must be adapted to the
contextual differences and needs of low-resource hospitals.
 We propose to obtain and use stakeholder input to customize a multi-component 3WP Toolkit that will
facilitate 3WP implementation in SNHs. Using the tailored Toolkit, we will implement and evaluate the 3WP in
the three SNHs of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. We will conduct a pragmatic type 2
hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to evaluate the quality of EOL ICU care, bereaved families’
psychological symptoms, and clinician burnout as compared to usual care. We will use the Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
Implementation, and Maintenance) framework to guide a mixed-methods evaluation of the 3WP
implementation in SNHs.
 Our team of clinicians and scientists have collaborated previously and have expertise in EOL care,
implementation science, qualitative research, research in the safety-net system, and 3WP implementation. We
hypothesize that our novel effectiveness-implementation approach will demonstrate that the 3WP addresses
key gaps in palliative care in SNHs, which have historically had less ability to implement novel interventions.
The results of this study will provide a roadmap to implement interventions in SNHs and lay the foundation for
broader dissemination, adoption, and sustainment of the 3WP in diverse healthcare settings."

In type 1 diabetes (T1D), autoimmunity is established and self-perpetuating within the islets at diagnosis.
Autoreactive T cells in T1D patients destroy endogenous and grafted beta cells, yet there is a gap in
knowledge about the mechanisms by which T cell pathogenesis is modulated in the islets. Evidence from
mouse models of T1D and human samples suggest that myeloid cells play an essential role in this process.
The myeloid compartment represents the largest immune population in non-diabetic and many T1D human
islets. Islet myeloid cells can contribute to islet destruction or protection, yet a significant gap in knowledge
remains about how the islet myeloid compartment plays such divergent roles in islet autoimmunity during T1D
progression. We have shown that Mertk signaling in islet myeloid cells suppresses autoreactive T cell
responsiveness to antigen and prevents rapid progression of T1D. Mertk mediates apoptotic cell uptake
(efferocytosis), and its signaling is immunoregulatory. However, we do not yet understand the mechanisms by
which Mertk signaling in islet myeloid cells suppresses the ability of autoreactive T cells to respond to locally
presented antigen. Our scRNA-seq analyses of myeloid cells from the islets of non-diabetic and T1D organ
donors support that, similar to our mouse data, efferocytosis is enhanced and antigen processing and
presentation are suppressed during the active period of disease following T1D onset. Thus, our overarching
hypothesis is that in the islets during T1D, stimulatory myeloid cell subsets promote pathogenic T cell functions
through antigenic stimulation and inhibitory islet myeloid cell subsets suppress the pathogenic T cells in a
manner that is dependent upon Mertk mediated efferocytosis within the pancreatic islet. To begin to address
the gaps in knowledge about islet myeloid cell function, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Elucidate the
mechanisms by which Mertk expressing myeloid cells modulate effector and regulatory T cell responses in the
islets. Aim 2: Characterize the myeloid cell subsets that actively present antigen to effector and regulatory T
cells in mouse islets and how this is altered by Mertk signaling. Aim 3: Determine the human islet myeloid
subsets that perform Mertk-mediated efferocytosis and drive T cell signaling in human islets. The successful
completion of this proposal will result in: (1) an improved understanding of the mechanisms used by Mertk-
expressing islet myeloid cells to suppress the islet T cell response, (2) an enhanced understanding of
pancreatic islet myeloid cell subsets and pathways that drive pathogenic T cell activation versus those that
regulate islet autoimmunity and (3) identification of novel therapeutic targets to potentially skew the autoim-
mune T cell response toward protective immunity in type 1 diabetes."
10862667,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Excess dietary salt intake is associated with cardiovascular disease and is a major contributing factor to the
pathogenesis of hypertension. Salt-sensitive hypertension in both humans and rodent models is associated with
elevations in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid [NaCl]. The resultant relative hypernatremia activates central circuits
to increase sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and arterial blood pressure (ABP). There are brain NaCl-sensors
in the circumventricular organs such as the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and
subfornical organ (SFO); activation of OVLT/SFO neurons stimulates thirst, vasopressin (AVP) secretion, and
SNA, whereas interruption of neurotransmission in OVLT/SFO lowers ABP in salt-sensitive models. However,
the mechanisms by which OVLT/SFO neurons sense extracellular [NaCl] are not known. Recent data suggest
the Na+-K+-2Cl- co-transporter (NKCC2) is not kidney specific but is also expressed in brain regions that regulate
whole body NaCl and water homeostasis. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ingestion of excess
dietary salt elevates extracellular [NaCl] to activate NaCl-sensitive neurons in the OVLT/SFO through NKCC2.
In turn, this activates descending pathways to elevate SNA and ABP. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these
NaCl-sensing mechanisms are sensitized in salt-sensitive humans, since our preliminary data show
hypernatremia evokes a greater increase in OVLT discharge of Dahl-salt sensitive versus Dahl-salt resistant rats
fed a high salt diet. We propose 2 specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will determine the extent by which NKCC2
mediates NaCl-sensing in OVLT/SFO neurons and elevate SNA and ABP to acute NaCl loading or chronic salt-
sensitive hypertension in rodents. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that an NKCC2 antagonist will blunt
hypernatremia-induced central neural activation and SNA in salt resistant and salt sensitive adults with high BP,
and that central neural activation will be greater in salt sensitive adults, suggesting heightened sodium sensing.
Successful completion of these aims will provide needed information on the cellular elements that mediate
intrinsic NaCl-sensing of hypothalamic neurons and provide novel data on central sodium sensing in salt
sensitive humans. This is a translational R01, bringing two laboratories together that have a track record of
successful collaboration, and these studies will provide a framework for the development of novel therapeutic
treatments of salt-sensitive hypertension."
10898900,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
State-of-the-art risk assessments in chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) only partially capture risk for
cardiovascular events (CVEs), leaving substantial ‘residual risk’ unaddressed. Current risk assessments also
incompletely capture resilience to CAD, defined as those at high risk by contemporary algorithms—but without
disease. This ‘residual protection’ highlights novel resiliency factors protective against the development of
CAD. In this context, it is crucial to understand factors related to both residual risk and resiliency to personalize
risk prediction and help clinicians and patients make better treatment decisions. Our overarching hypothesis
is that a multi ‘omics’ approach can identify molecular features of residual risk and resilience in CAD.
Historically, omics studies of CAD were limited by 1) phenotypic heterogeneity—reliance on variable definitions
of CAD and CVEs, biasing results and limiting prediction; and 2) risk homogeneity—constraining identification
of novel pathways and limiting generalizability. We overcome these limitations by leveraging unique access to
landmark NHLBI CAD strategy trials and a cohort study with aligned core-lab confirmed testing, molecular
data, and adjudicated CVEs. Collectively, these studies span the CAD risk continuum—a feature critical to
assessing performance of biomarkers and molecular features and overcoming prior limitations. Preliminary
data supporting our hypothesis show: 1) substantial, unexplained residual risk (>30%) for death/myocardial
infarction with a clinical model of risk factors and CAD severity, 2) biomarkers of inflammation, myocyte injury
and distension improve model performance, and 3) novel transcriptome modules of inflammation and
interferon signaling further improve prediction. New preliminary data from the imputed transcriptome of
‘resilient’ patients without CAD demonstrates dysregulated pathways and genes of fatty acid metabolism. Our
overall goal is to leverage well-phenotyped participants from these landmark studies to improve CVE
prediction and better understand resilience to CAD. We propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Improve
prediction of CVEs in patients with established CAD. We will test and validate (1a) candidate biomarkers,
polygenic risk scores for CAD and (1b) transcriptomics to improve CVE prediction beyond a clinical model of
risk factors and state-of-the-art testing (core-lab confirmed severity of CAD and ischemia). Aim 2: Identify
biomarkers and molecular features of resilience to CAD. We will test the association of (2a) candidate
biomarkers and (2b) transcriptomics among resilient patients without CAD despite a high probability of disease
by clinical and polygenic risk scores for CAD. In the applicant’s opinion, this proposal is innovative and departs
from the status quo by using meticulously adjudicated CVEs and phenotype from patients across the CAD risk
spectrum and is significant because it will accelerate personalized risk stratification and treatment—especially
for the large number of patients at intermediate risk for CAD and CVEs. Ultimately, knowledge generated from
this application has the potential to improve the care and outcomes for millions of Americans with CAD."
10896451,"Project Summary/Abstract
Approximately 30,000 Americans suffer an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) each year, at a mean
age in the mid-50s leading to many years of lost productivity. Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) occurs in every
fifth patient with SAH with onset between 3-7 days after aneurysm rupture, and is the leading cause of
morbidity. Identifying the onset of DCI is challenging even though patients are closely monitored in intensive
care units, and too often DCI is only recognized in retrospect. There are several reasons for this: (1) cerebral
ischemia results in loss of function and is not passively observable in a neurologically injured patient, (2) can
be mistaken for mimics such as seizure or delirium and delay diagnosis, (3) confirmatory testing is resource
heavy and carries potential risk which necessitates surpassing a high threshold of suspicion. Existing DCI
prediction models do not offer the necessary timeliness nor precision. Improving timeliness and precision of
DCI prediction would enable interventions to prevent strokes in patients with SAH as well as reduce
overly aggressive treatment. Leveraging the impact that the inflammatory pathomechanism of DCI has on
systemic physiology, we created an artificial intelligence (AI) risk score for DCI using features derived from
universally available vital signs that updates with new information. In a pseudo-prospective experiment on data
from external institutions, this risk score uniquely met the criteria for an ideal situational monitor that does not
yet exist: continuous, non-invasive, independent of pretest probability, operator-independent, quantitative, and
timely (12 hours before clinical diagnosis). The World Health Organization standard of ethics for AI in
healthcare decrees that algorithms should be tested rigorously in the setting in which the technology will be
used, and ensure that it meets standards of safety and efficacy. The risks of an untested AI based clinical
decision support are misinterpretation and over-trusting with harm to patients at worst, and inconsequence at
best. This proposal encompasses the necessary steps to translate this promising model into a tool that can be
integrated into clinical practice. In Aim 1, we will perform a Silent Validation and Simulation Study to evaluate
the accuracy and acceptance of this novel AI technology in a realistic clinical setting. In Aim 2, we will use
Contextual Design methodology for user-centered participatory design and rapid agile prototyping to refine the
optimal implementation in clinician workflow. In Aim 3, we will produce an open standards-based interoperable
architecture that will be plug and play for implementation at external institutions. The translation of a DCI risk
model into a continuous monitor fills an important gap in the management of patients with SAH, and an open
standards architecture enables affordable and rapidly achievable dissemination of this novel technology, while
providing an essential validation for the standards community."
10935960,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: This proposal details a 5-year plan to provide Dr. Rachel Margolis with the
knowledge and skills to become an independent clinical and translational researcher focused on promoting
health equity by improving pediatric asthma outcomes. Research Plan: Striking socioeconomic and racial/ethnic
disparities persist in pediatric asthma, particularly among under-resourced, Black children in urban settings.
Evidence demonstrates that structural and psychosocial risk factors contribute to these disparities. Maternal
depression is one prevalent and potentially modifiable risk factor. While there is evidence that treating maternal
depression may improve child health outcomes, mothers from under-resourced communities face significant
barriers to community-based treatment of depression. Integrated care (i.e., the delivery of mental health care
within the context of other ongoing medical care in a physical health care setting) offers an exciting and under-
explored option. It has been associated with reduced maternal depression and improved child health in pediatric
primary care. However, the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of embedding maternal depression treatment
into community-based pediatric asthma care needs to be demonstrated. Enhanced Brief Interpersonal
Psychotherapy (IPT-B) is a promising depression treatment for under-resourced mothers that has proven
efficacious among similar women in other settings, but it has not been studied within ongoing pediatric asthma
care. To maximize the success of Enhanced IPT-B in an asthma clinic setting, it is necessary to identify and
address potential mother and provider-level barriers to integrated depression care. Stakeholder engagement
with mothers and asthma clinic staff can facilitate the process of understanding and mitigating these barriers.
Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to use stakeholder input to integrate and evaluate maternal depression
treatment in a community-based asthma clinic providing care to predominately under-resourced, Black children
with asthma. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Engage stakeholders in determining the most effective and acceptable
model for integrating Enhanced IPT-B for mothers into community-based pediatric asthma care; 2) Determine
the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of Enhanced IPT-B on decreasing maternal depressive
symptoms in a specific community-based pediatric asthma clinic through a pilot RCT; and 3) Determine the
preliminary efficacy of the intervention on improving child asthma care and health outcomes. Training Plan:
Through didactic coursework and mentored research experiences with her multidisciplinary team of
mentors/advisors, Dr. Margolis will develop advanced qualitative and mixed methods skills, learn clinical trial
design with a focus on behavioral interventions for under-resourced and racial/ethnic minority families, and gain
advanced implementation science skills. Dr. Margolis will emerge from her K01 training and research experience
as an independent behavioral scientist committed to enhancing health equity."
10726615,"Deployed and nondeployed military personnel are at higher risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI) than
civilians. TBI of all severities can result in chronic disturbances of cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and physical
functioning. Learning, memory and attention are especially vulnerable across the spectrum of TBI injury severity
and symptoms may persist years to decades. While most TBIs experienced by Veteran’s are mild, enduring a
severe TBI produces significant personal, societal and economic burden. TBIs that require hospitalization
account for approximately 90% of total TBI medical costs. There are currently no FDA-approved
pharmacotherapies to treat TBI. Thus, research to develop new pharmacotherapies for TBI will benefit Veterans
with persistent posttraumatic neurocognitive disabilities. These impairments have been recapitulated in pre-
clinical TBI models. Animals demonstrate poor performance on cognitive tasks along with associated
pathological synaptic communication on molecular, anatomical and electrophysiological scales. Furthermore,
these models for the investigation of underlying cellular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets of TBI
associated impairments.
 Synaptic strength and plasticity are believed to underlie learning and memory behaviors. Dysfunction of
synapses is one of the earliest and most common abnormalities preceding neuronal death in neurodegenerative
diseases and has been reported in several animal models of TBI. Neurogranin (Ng), a post-synaptic protein
localized to post-synaptic dendritic spines, notably regulates synaptic plasticity through calcium-dependent
temporal and spatial regulation of calmodulin (CaM). Synaptic activity leads to precisely timed changes in Ng
phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC). This is synchronized with Ca2+-CaM downstream signaling and
Calcium-Calmodulin Kinase II (CaMKII) activation via autophosphorylation. Ng modulates synaptic excitability
through these pathways. CSF and blood levels of Ng have also been used as biofluid biomarkers of synaptic
neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative syndromes, as well as in acute TBI.
Recently, chronic decreases in plasma exosome levels of Ng was seen in combat-deployment-related mild TBI.
Our recent findings showed significantly reduced Ng protein expression in the rat cortex and hippocampus up to
two weeks after controlled cortical impact, particularly in the CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus. This evidence
suggests Ng’s potential involvement in pathological mechanisms of learning and memory difficulties after TBI.
 The overall hypothesis is that decreased Ng expression contributes to dysfunctional synaptic plasticity
and cognition after TBI. Specific Aim 1 will examine the effects of TBI on Ng signaling, associated synaptic
proteins and dendritic morphology. Preliminary data shows Ng is detectable in serum in sham and CCI-injured
animals at two weeks post-injury. Thus, for the first time, an experimental model can be utilized to directly study
the relationship between biofluid Ng levels and conformational synaptic neuropathology. Specific Aim 2 will next
examine using adeno-associated viral (AAV) delivery to increase neuronal Ng in the hippocampus. Retinoic acid
(RA), a metabolite of Vitamin A, increases Ng protein levels and has been identified as a potential
pharmacotherapeutic for ischemic injury and other neurological disorders. Specific Aim 3 will determine the
effects of RA therapy on Ng signaling, synaptic neurodegeneration, and cognitive function after TBI. Successful
completion of this study will identify Ng as a therapeutic target and biomarker of synaptic dysfunction in TBI."
10726616,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
 Breast cancer (BC) is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by a mixed bag of cells. BC is
broadly classified into luminal, HER2+, and basal-like based on differential expression of estrogen, progesterone,
and HER-2 receptor proteins found inside and on the surface of the cancer cells. Basal-like, which is about 10-
20% of BC, tests negative for both hormone receptors and HER2, considered triple-negative BC (TNBC). TNBC
is characterized by resistance to chemotherapy, acquisition of the stem character, and unfavorable prognoses
due to its highly metastatic phenotype and more likely to recur (come back) after treatment. TNBC patients still
have minimal treatment options, and chemotherapy is currently the only treatment available for metastatic TNBC.
Although checkpoint inhibitors, including PD-1 and PD-L1, were found to elicit a response in TNBC in initial
clinical trials, optimistic results have not yet emerged from these trials. Thus, the detection of appropriate targeted
therapeutic regimens for TNBC therapy and prevention has remained an elusive challenge to many laboratories.
During our program of identifying molecule(s) that could play an inhibitory role against TNBC, we found that
CCN5/WISP-2, a matricellular 29-35 kDa protein and a member of the CCN family of growth factors, can
modulate TNBC by imparting an inhibitory effect on tumor progression. We have demonstrated that induced
expression of CCN5 or administration of human recombinant CCN5 protein in TNBC cells resulted in suppressing
tumorigenic properties and induction of growth arrest. CCN5 is also known to inhibit the stemness, reverse the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, modulate CCN-family proteins, and activate ER-α in TNBC
cells. Building on these exciting findings, we now propose creating and establishing an innovative approach to
make CCN5 for a therapeutic implication of TNBC growth and metastasis by synthetic modification of CCN5
protein through the conjugation of polyethylene glycol (CCN5 PEGylation; PEG-CCN5). Our long-term goal is to
translate these findings to the clinic to treat TNBC. In Aim 1, we will generate a PEGylated CCN5 derivative for
TNBC therapy alone or in a combination of an anti-hormone or chemotherapy and Characterize the novel
biomarkers to improve diagnosis and therapeutic outcome. In Aim 2, we will develop drug repurposing strategies
for targeted activation of CCN5 for therapies to slow or arrest breast cancer initiation or progression in pre-clinical
mouse models. Lastly, in Aim 3, by dissecting the effect of CCN5 on CCN-family proteins (CCN1 and CTGF),
major tumorigenesis drivers in TNBC, we will determine how CCN5 governs reprogramming mesenchymal to
epithelial transition (MET), apoptosis, tumor growth inhibition, and mouse survival. These studies are expected
to identify an optimal PEGylated protein or a CCN5-activator that will inhibit TNBC growth and progression and
sensitize TNBC cells to tamoxifen and Paclitaxel with minimal systemic toxicity or ill effects on healthy cells or
organs. A novel mechanism of action of CCN5 will be found. Thus, these approaches should significantly
advance knowledge on the therapeutic utility of CCN5 and its mechanistic insights in the suppression of TNBC.
We will use multiple state-of-art techniques and our multi-disciplinary team's unique collective expertise to
complete the goal."
10726617,"High dose acetaminophen (AAP) with delayed n-acetylcysteine (NAC) rescue has shown promise in early
phase clinical trials, inducing disease shrinkage in 8/14 and an objective response in 3/14 assessable patients
with diverse tumor types. However, the mechanism of anti-tumor activity of high dose AAP is not well
understood. It was previously felt that high dose AAP has anti-tumor activity via similar processes as its
mechanism of hepatotoxicity, namely free radical injury and glutathione depletion. However, pre-clinical and
clinical evidence suggests that glutathione is not depleted within the tumor in response to high-dose AAP
treatment. This suggests an alternate mechanism of anti-tumor activity of high dose AAP. In this proposal, we
outline preliminary data suggesting that: 1.) High dose AAP has anti-cancer stem cell (CSC) activity and 2.)
High dose AAP functions as a novel inhibitor of STAT3 phosphorylation. STAT3 is a protein that has
previously been shown to play an important role in the maintenance and proliferation of a viable CSC
population. We hypothesize that the anti-CSC activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of high dose AAP
is via a STAT3 dependent mechanism. In specific aim #1, sub-aim A, we propose to evaluate the mechanism
of STAT3 inhibition by AAP. We have obtained preliminary data suggesting that AAP binds STAT3 in the SH2
domain via a strong hydrogen bond formed at Lys626. We aim to validate these preliminary findings using
orthogonal approaches such as microscale thermopheresis (MST). These studies will be performed in
collaboration with co-mentor Umesh Desai, PhD, head of Medicinal Chemistry at Virginia Commonwealth
University (VCU). In sub-aim B, we evaluate the mechanism of the anti-CSC activity of high dose AAP. We
will generate constructs of human NSCLC with altered STAT3 proteins: empty vector (STAT3 KO), STAT3
K626K (WT) and STAT3 K626A (predicted to have decreased AAP-binding). We will determine the sensitivity
of STAT3-altered constructs to the anti-CSC effects of AAP or AAP + NAC. If human NSCLC cells with STAT3
K626A have decreased responsiveness to the anti-CSC effects of high dose AAP, this would suggest that the
anti-CSC effects of AAP are mediated by direct binding to STAT3. In specific aim #2, we will evaluate the
mechanisms of synergy between chemotherapy (in NSCLC without targetable driver mutation) and targeted
therapy (in NSCLC with EGFR or ALK driver alteration) with AAP, both in vitro and in vivo. We will investigate
whether AAP-enhances chemotherapy/targeted therapy anti-tumor activity via a a STAT3 dependent
mechanism. In this CDA application, Dr. Neuwelt proposes to work with an outstanding group of established
scientists whom have the experience and expertise necessary to mentor Dr. Neuwelt on the proposed project.
Dr. Neuwelt’s primary mentor will be Dr. Patel, a senior VA-merit funded researcher with expertise in cancer
stem cell biology. Dr. Larner, a co-mentor on the project, discovered the role of STAT3 in mitochondrial
function and has dedicated much of his career to understanding STAT3 physiology. If awarded a CDA, Dr.
Neuwelt will enroll in relevant classes at local Universities, attend scientific conferences, take care of VA-based
patients, and grow his research lab, all with the goal of becoming an independent VA-based physician
scientist."

Two-photon laser scanning microscopy powers many projects in the BRAIN initiative because
it is the best way to capture the concerted activity of living neural networks. Genetically-
encoded activity probes and sensors built with fluorescent proteins are the tools of choice for
labeling and recording from living circuits of neurons. However, to date, virtually all
optimization of these probes has been solely in the one-photon regime. This is mainly because
measuring quantitative two-photon absorption properties demands more sophisticated
equipment and expertise in photophysics and nonlinear optics. The BRAIN initiative has driven
many laboratories to create new genetically encoded fluorescent probes and biosensors. To
characterize their multiphoton properties we created a special Resource for Multiphoton
Characterization of Genetically-Encoded Probes that is supported by NIH/NINDS. This
characterization is indispensable because it identifies optimum wavelengths for 2P excitation,
and aids quantitative comparison of 2P brightness and 2P dynamic range (for biosensors).
Over the previous funding period our Resource was used by 17 different investigators and if
the grant renewed, this number will increase to 30 labs by the end of the 5th year of the next
cycle.
 As in the previous funding period, we will provide a very broad access to our facility for
Investigators whose research is relevant to the NIH/NINDS mission and to the goals of the
BRAIN initiative. The information obtained will be broadly disseminated via scientific
publications and two community-driven websites. We will organize annual workshops where
we will provide training on 2PA photophysics and methods of measurements and provide all
necessary information for researchers who were willing to start such measurements in their
labs."
10843888,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of infections worldwide. In recent decades, the treatment of S.
aureus infections has become increasingly difficult because of the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance,
justifying the need for developing alternative therapeutics. Antimicrobial blue light (aBL; 405 nm wavelength),
an innovative nonpharmacological approach, has attracted increasing attention due to its intrinsic activity
against a wide range of bacteria irrespective of their antibiotic resistance profiles. However, it has also been
found that S. aureus is much more tolerant of 405 nm aBL than most other bacteria. A potential reason for the
higher tolerance of S. aureus to aBL is the presence of staphyloxanthin (STX) in S. aureus. STX acts as an
antioxidant and facilitates the tolerance of S. aureus to oxidative stress generated by 405 nm aBL. Fortunately,
a recent study discovered that STX is prone to photobleaching by 460 nm wavelength irradiation. This finding
leads to our central hypothesis that 460 nm irradiation would potentiate the susceptibility of S. aureus to
killing by 405 nm aBL. To test this hypothesis, we propose two Specific Aims:
In Aim 1, we will first investigate the efficacy of the dual-wavelength irradiation (DWI; 460 nm followed by 405
nm) strategy for killing S. aureus in vitro. A panel of S. aureus isolates, including ATCC reference strains and
recent clinical isolates, will be selected. Both planktonic bacteria and biofilms will be studied. We will also
assess the effect of the pre-application of 460 nm irradiation on the 405 nm aBL-induced production of reactive
oxygen species in S. aureus. Additionally, as the safety study, we will evaluate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity
of DWI to normal human cells by treating human cells under therapeutic exposures of DWI for eradicating S.
aureus. Finally, we will determine whether DWI affects the ROS-producing capability of the immune cells.
In Aim 2, we will conduct a preclinical study to determine the efficacy and safety of DWI for treating cutaneous
S. aureus abscesses in mice. We will use a bioluminescent strain of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA
USA 300) to infect mice, thus allowing real-time monitoring of the extent of infection in living animals using
bioluminescence imaging. DWI will be initiated at varying time points (30 min, 4 h, or 48 h) after infection. To
facilitate light penetration in biological tissues, we will use a novel optical lens-microneedle array patch to
deliver light interstitially to the infection sites. The efficacy found with DWI will be compared with that of
systemic tetracycline, an empirical antibiotic therapy in clinic for cutaneous S. aureus infections. As the safety
study, we will determine the effects of DWI on the viability and DNA damage of the host cells, wound healing,
and inflammatory response in treated tissues.
Collectively, the successful completion of the Specific Aims outlined in this application will provide the
foundation required to determine the effectiveness and safety of DWI for treating localized S. aureus infections;
and will help establish protocols for the use of this innovative strategy."
10892857,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposed project investigates the hypothesis that risk factors for prostate cancer differ by molecular
subtype of the tumor. It addresses the conundrum that prostate cancer has fewer established risk factors than
other cancer types, despite its high incidence and mortality. By credentialing risk factors, this project lays the
ground for primary prevention efforts and for mechanistic research. Notably, few studies have investigated
etiologic differences based on molecular subtypes of prostate cancer.
 In this project, we will molecularly profile 3,373 prostate tumors diagnosed among 107,313 men (23% of
whom are African-American) who participate in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), the
Physicians’ Health Study (PHS), or the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) and on whom we have
collected decades of prospective risk factor data prior to cancer diagnosis. The project builds on our previous
work demonstrating that potential prostate cancer risk factors such as obesity, height, and some inherited
genetic variants may specifically be associated with tumors with the common TMPRSS2:ERG fusion. To
assess the most common molecular subtypes with different mechanisms of carcinogenesis, we will apply
cutting-edge, in-situ pathology methods for (1) gene fusions from the ETS family (TMPRSS2:ERG, ETV1,
ETV4, ETV5), (2) loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN, and (3) gain of the oncogene MYC.
 In Aim 1, we will generate population-based data on the prevalence of the common tumor alterations by
age at diagnosis and assess the co-occurrence of molecular phenotypes at the cellular level with integrated
single-cell data. In Aim 2, we will assess risk factors for molecular subtypes of prostate cancer. We will
characterize which molecular subtypes are associated with non-modifiable risk factors (family history, attained
height, and inherited risk as measured by the polygenic risk score for prostate cancer), modifiable risk factors
with substantial prior evidence (adult-age adiposity and smoking), and novel risk factors for specific subtypes
(physical activity and insulinemic dietary patterns). In Aim 3, we will tailor the cBioPortal, the most widely used
cancer genomics portal, for accessible data-sharing in molecular cancer epidemiology.
 The impact of this project will be the generation of the first population-based, age-specific prevalence data
on molecular subtypes and their co-occurrence; the connection between etiology and molecular heterogeneity;
and the availability of high-quality original data from decades of follow-up for the research community.
Importantly, a nuanced understanding of the etiology of prostate cancer is indispensable to reducing its
mortality burden through primary prevention, as it has been for other tumor entities. Credentialing any
additional modifiable risk factor is poised to have a significant impact, given the quickly rising burden of
prostate cancer with the aging of the global population."

In the bacterium Escherichia coli, ~40% of transcription termination is factor-dependent termination, mediated
by the ATP-dependent RNA translocase Rho, and ~60% of transcription termination is intrinsic termination,
mediated by sequences at which transcription yields an RNA hairpin followed by an RNA U-tract.
In the archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis, most transcription termination is factor-dependent termination,
mediated by the endoribonuclease and processive exoribonuclease aCPSF1 (archaeal cleavage and
polyadenylation specificity factor 1).
Bacterial and archaeal transcription initiation and transcription elongation and their regulation are well
understood, but bacterial and archaeal transcription termination and its regulation are poorly understood.
Structures of a minimal functional factor-dependent pre-termination complex, a minimal functional intrinsic
pre-termination complex, and a post-termination complex have become available only very recently, and no
structural information whatsoever is available for steps in termination between formation of a pre-termination
complex and formation of a post-termination complex.
We propose to determine structures of intact, complete functional bacterial and archaeal factor-dependent
pre-termination complexes, to determine structures of intact, complete functional bacterial intrinsic
pre-termination complexes, and, most important, to obtain structural and functional information for
intermediates in termination between formation of a pre-termination complex and formation of a
post-termination complex. Our results will test directly the ""RNAP hypertranslocation,"" ""RNA extraction,"" and
""allosteric"" hypotheses for termination, will distinguish directly between ""external force"" and ""invasion"" models
for termination, and will define, comprehensively, the protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-protein
interactions in factor-dependent termination, intrinsic termination, and Q-dependent antitermination.
The proposed work will use cryo-EM, single-molecule picometer-resolution nanopore tweezers (SPRNT), and
deep sequencing to address three Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Define the structural and mechanistic basis of factor-dependent transcription termination
Aim 2: Define the structural and mechanistic basis of intrinsic transcription termination
Aim 3: Define the structural and mechanistic basis of Q-dependent transcription antitermination
The proposed work will contribute directly to understanding bacterial and archaeal transcription and
transcriptional regulation. Because bacterial RNAP and, especially, archaeal RNAP show sequence, structural,
and mechanistic similarities to eukaryotic RNAP, the results also will contribute to understanding eukaryotic
transcription and transcriptional regulation."

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
the US. Despite the benefits of LDL lowering therapies, there remains a large burden of residual
CVD, related to persistent dyslpidemia and inflammation. Even though CANTOS and colchicine
trials have established the benefit of anti-inflammatory therapies, these approaches were
associated with a significant increase in infectious complications, limiting their clinical application.
This suggests the need for a deeper understanding of the links between dyslipidemia and
atherosclerotic inflammation, leading to more effective targeting of relevant mechanisms and
susceptible populations. This grant has supported studies of the mechanisms linking defective
cholesterol efflux pathways to macrophage and neutrophil inflammatory processes, including
NLRP3 inflammasome activation and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. We recently
discovered a new pathway linking macrophage cholesterol accumulation (mediated through
defective cholesterol efflux or loading with modified LDL) to ER cholesterol accumulation and
activation of a signaling pathway that leads to deubiquitylation and assembly of the NLRP3
inflammasome. Inhibition of this pathway with the deubiquitinase inhibitor holomycin led to
reduced atherosclerosis and NETosis, suggesting a new approach to reducing inflammasome
activation and atherosclerosis. The same pathway appears to be activated in TET2 clonal
hematopoiesis. The proposed studies will further explore the role of the newly defined pathway
in promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic mice with
defective cholesterol efflux or TET2 clonal hematopoiesis and in human cells containing TET2
mutations. The ability of reconstituted HDL to promote cholesterol efflux and to reverse
inflammasome activation, leading to plaque stabilization, will also be investigated. The proposal
should provide new mechanistic insights into the links between macrophage cholesterol
accumulation and plaque inflammation and will evaluate novel precision therapeutic approaches
to atherosclerosis."

The VAREC Research Core will support the research activities of the VAREC research projects to allow a
greater reach for each component, increase the rigor and reproducibility of the research and facilitate cross-
talk between the research projects. These goals will be accomplished through three aims. The primary goal of
Aim 1 will be to generate and coordinate access to mice that have undergone one of two voluntary alcohol
exposure models in mice. In the first, Chronic Drinking-Forced Abstinence (CDFA), isolate female mice are
allowed ad libitum home cage access to two-bottle choice alcohol for 6 weeks, after which the ethanol bottle is
removed and replaced with water-only to produce a forced abstinence phase. In the second model, Structured
Tracking of Alcohol Reinforcement (STAR), mice are trained to operantly seek and consume ethanol, and
“compulsive” intake is assessed via quinine sensitivity tests. A pre-test, manipulation such as binge alcohol
access, and then a post-test allow for dense sampling of individual mouse behavior in a paradigm well suited
for precision neuroscience approaches. The primary goal of Aim 2 will be to provide key shared research
infrastructure to VAREC researchers, including blood-ethanol measurement, 3-D printing, and histochemical
resources amongst others. Finally in Aim 3, robust computational infrastructure and expertise will be provided
to VAREC researchers to allow computational analysis of neuronal activity in association with AUD-related
behaviors, and quantification of brain imaging data."
10872150,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Most therapies that target microbiome composition do not have a detectable impact on the gut microbiome
and are not robust to the interpersonal diversity and plasticity of the community in human hosts. To develop a
better mechanistic understanding of the microbe-host relationship and more effective microbiome-mediated
therapies, approaches based on functional modulation of the gut microbiome are necessary. However, these
approaches have been difficult to develop. Attaining long-term engraftment in the luminal environment has
proven to be quite difficult, and even once engraftment has been achieved, a change in physiology or
improvement of pathologic phenotype has not yet been demonstrated. There is a critical need for a tool that will
allow investigators to “knock-in” functions into the gut microbiome and investigate their effects on the luminal
milieu and, ultimately, physiology in conventionally-raised hosts in non-sterile conditions. The investigators
propose a novel approach to address this need by using native bacteria as chassis for the introduction of specific
functions into the luminal environment. The proposal's innovation is a new strategy that allows the quick and
effective “knock-in” of a beneficial function in a sustained manner into conventional hosts. To date they have
demonstrated that tractable native bacteria can be engineered to express a beneficial function ex vivo,
reintroduced to the host, engraft the entire gut of the host, and deliver an intended beneficial function. These
functions can affect host physiology, help determine the effect of specific bacterial functions and potentially
alleviate disease. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that long-term colonization and functional change in
the gut microbiome of a conventional host can be performed effectively with engineered native bacteria.
 In the next five years, the investigators will continue the development of this technology and better
understand the chassis-host interactions that will aid in the development of live bacterial therapeutics for clinical
use. First, the investigators will engineer regulatory systems for the transgene of interest, including a sense and
control, protein secretion, and biocontainment circuit. They will test whether these systems function in vivo in
hosts that are in a non-sterile environment. In addition, they will assess the natural biocontainment of engineered
native bacteria among co-housed hosts. Second, they will determine how the niche for a bacterial chassis affects
function delivery and whether multiple functions can be delivered by the same chassis or whether different
chassis are necessary for the delivery of multiple functions. Finally, the investigators will determine the role of
microbial community in amplifying the effects of a transgene of interest in gnotobiotic mice. The expected
outcome of the proposed studies is attainment of fundamental biological knowledge of how the gut microbiome
can be functionally manipulated. These studies will have a positive translational impact because they will
demonstrate that synthetic biology approaches can lead to the development of curative interventions to some of
the most debilitating and costly chronic diseases."
10931669,"This proposal seeks to determine how TDP-43 protein aggregates dysregulate P-body function in
neurons and subsequently produce neurotoxicity. Cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 has been reported in
nearly every age-dependent neurodegenerative disease, including in >40% of frontotemporal dementia (FTD),
in the hippocampal neurons of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, in >90% of ALS. It also defines a recently
recognized AD-like dementia in the oldest elderly, an AD-like syndrome named Limbic-predominant Age-
related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE). We have identified that TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregates regulate the
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of RNA processing bodies (P-bodies) in neuron-like cells and
postmortem spinal cord motor neurons in ALS patients. P-bodies are cytoplasmic membraneless
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules composed of RNAs and protein complexes involved in translational repression
and mRNA decay. Neurons carry a high number of P-bodies in the soma. We hypothesize that TDP-43
aggregation causes neuronal toxicity by disrupting the morphology and function of P-bodies. Our
proposal is highly innovative because how TDP-43 proteinopathy regulates the LLPS of other membraneless
organelles has not been reported in vivo. We propose to use cutting-edge imaging, proteomic, and sequencing
approaches to determine the protein and RNA composition of neuronal P-bodies and how it changes in response
to TDP-43 aggregation in vivo. We will first determine how TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregates initiate P-body
disassembly and then determine the RNA metabolism change in neurons carrying TDP-43 aggregates or
defective P-bodies. Lastly and importantly, we will determine whether P-body proteins and RNA can serve as
pathological markers for AD-related dementia, such as LATE."
10888397,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There has been a renewed interest in how oncogenic driver mutations and tumor suppressor losses contribute
to cancer-associated alterations in cellular metabolism. Much of the effort has been focused on the avidity with
which most cancer cells take up glucose only to release most of the glucose carbon as lactate, a process
known as aerobic glycolysis or the “Warburg Effect”. This seemingly wasteful metabolism has puzzled cancer
biologists for decades. Nevertheless, aerobic glycolysis has been shown to be a sustainable way to support
the continuous production of glycolytic intermediates that are utilized in de novo synthesis of proteins, lipids,
and nucleic acids. Over a decade ago, the Thompson laboratory embarked on analyzing tumor utilization of
glutamine, the second most common nutrient present in extracellular fluid. While glucose is metabolized by
cancer cells primarily in the cytosol, we found that glutamine was metabolized primarily in the mitochondria.
Similar to glucose, we found that the majority of the carbon taken up as glutamine was secreted as lactate, a
process now known as glutaminolysis. Since that time, the study of glutaminolysis has focused on the role of
glutamine as an anaplerotic substrate to maintain mitochondrial function as carbon is taken out of the TCA
cycle in the form of citrate to fuel fatty acid biosynthesis and as aspartate to support nucleotide biosynthesis.
Tumor cell avidity for glutamine in vivo and the ability of glutamine catabolism to maintain oxidative
phosphorylation through TCA cycle anaplerosis has been confirmed in vivo. However, the role of
glutaminolysis in supporting tumor nitrogen metabolism is less well understood. Although inhibitors of
glutamine metabolism have been explored in cancer therapy, their success in the clinic has been limited in part
because of our incomplete knowledge of tumor nitrogen metabolism. Understanding the role of nitrogen
metabolism in supporting cancer cell survival and growth has become the central focus of the Thompson
laboratory. We are currently exploring the hypothesis that glutamine-dependent mitochondrial glutamate
accumulation provides the cell with an intracellular reserve of reduced nitrogen that can be directed toward
mitochondrial support of de novo polyamine production, amino acid biosynthesis, and glutathione generation.
We are also studying how the differential fates of mitochondrial glutamate are regulated by growth factors, as
well as by oncogenes and tumor suppressors. While the normal pool of mitochondrial glutamate is fed by
extracellular glutamine uptake, we also plan to test whether the combination of lactate and ammonia that
accumulates in the tumor microenvironment (TME) under nutrient-poor conditions can be utilized to restore
mitochondrial glutamate and cytosolic glutamine to levels that support adaptive translation and cell survival.
These results will help clarify how cancer cell avidity for nitrogen is satisfied based on nutrient availability and
the presence of specific oncogenic mutations and tumor suppressor losses. The insights gained will help to
shape new approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer."
10934356,"VHL tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) inactivation is the usual initiating (“truncal”) event in the most common
form of kidney cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). pVHL forms a ubiquitin ligase that targets the
HIF transcription factor for degradation. HIF2, but not HIF1, promotes ccRCC. Binding to pVHL requires that
the HIFalpha subunit be prolyl hydroxylated by one of the 3 oxygen-sensitive EglN prolyl hydroxylases, which
are 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent dioxygenases (as are the TET DNA demethylases and KDM histone
demethylases). IDH mutant cancers accumulate the 2-OG competitor 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Our work
contributed to the development of VEGF inhibitors/HIF2 inhibitors for ccRCC and 2-HG inhibitors for IDH
mutant leukemia. Our discovery that thalidomide reprograms cereblon to destroy the IKZF1/3 myeloma
oncoproteins has also galvanized interest in small molecule degraders.
 Not all ccRCCs respond to VEGF inhibitors/HIF2 inhibitors and 2-HG inhibitors are fairly inactive against
IDH mutant gliomas. Synthetic lethality (SL) should be a source of alternative drug targets for such tumors, and
more generally, for cancers linked to “undruggable” mutations. We have identified new potential SL interactors
for VHL (CDK4/6 and ITGAV) and mutant IDH (DHODH and GSK3b) and now propose further validation and
mechanistic studies. Intriguingly, Cyclin D1, the partner for CDK4/6, is a HIF2 target in ccRCC, but the SL
between VHL and CDK4/6 is not HIF2-dependent. We also embarked on SL screens in Drosophila cells
because paralog compensation likely causes many false-negatives in genetic screens with human cells.
 We created an “up” screen for chemicals and gene knockouts that can degrade a protein of interest. We
used it to discover that Spautin-1 is a cereblon-independent IKZF1 degrader and are pursuing the underlying
mechanism. We are also applying it to various undruggable oncoproteins (e.g., c-Myc, K-Ras, b-Catenin).
 Failure to downregulate Cyclin D1 causes resistance of VHL-/- ccRCC to HIF2 inhibitors in a pRB-
independent manner. We are using biochemical approaches to identify the relevant Cyclin D1 substrate(s).
 We unexpectedly found that HIF1 and HIF2 bind to approximately the same genomic sites, yet recruit
different proteins. We are validating these associated proteins in biochemical and functional assays. We are
also using substrate-trapping conditions to recover non-HIF EglN substrates and non-histone KDM substrates.
 We are continuing our efforts to use somatic gene editing with CRISPR to make a murine model of HIF2-
dependent VHL-/- ccRCC. We have also identified new pVHL-dependent secreted proteins including PTH-LH,
which might cause the cachexia and hypercalcemia seen in some ccRCC patients.
 ccRCC is highly immunogenic, but the reason is unknown. We found that HIF2 drives the expression of
many endogenous retroviruses, some of which can be translated and presented as HLA-bound peptides. We
are examining additional ccRCC cell lines and tumors for such peptides and whether they are immunogenic."
10741447,"Promising clinical outcomes in early liver transplantation (ELT) for severe alcoholic hepatitis raise new questions:
Does chronic and active alcohol use impact allograft rejection after ELT? Is a living donor or reduced sized liver
suitable for ELT? How early is too early to have an ELT? Is there a biologic basis why the majority of SAH
patients (>75%) without pre-transplant abstinence have no alcohol relapse 2-3 years after ELT? These questions
can be approached in animal models of liver transplantation. In the last funding period, we established a rat liver
transplantation model in which a DA or Lewis rat liver is transplanted into Lewis recipients fed with alcohol vs a
control diet for 8 weeks. We found chronic alcohol exposure not only reduced the recipient survival times
significantly, but also reduced the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy. Both chronic alcohol exposure and
immunosuppressive therapy inhibited liver regeneration following reduced sized (50%) liver transplantation;
Searching for an underlying mechanism, we found evidence of dramatically increased neutrophilic infiltration in
liver allografts of alcohol fed recipients early following transplantation and chronic alcohol exposure produced
excessive priming of the neutrophil respiratory burst in circulating leukocytes suggesting priming of the neutrophil
respiratory burst by alcohol exposure may play an important role in liver allograft rejection/oxidative injury and
regeneration. A striking finding is that a new stem cell mobilizing therapy (MRG-001) not only improved survival
of alcohol fed recipients (100%) following allogeneic liver transplantation, but also promoted liver allograft
regeneration. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that chronic and active alcohol abuse impacts innate
immunity especially neutrophils, and infiltration of alcohol dysregulated neutrophils promotes liver allograft
rejection/damage following transplantation. Further, current immunosuppressive therapy is ineffective in
preventing neutrophil infiltration and inhibits liver regeneration following reduced sized graft transplantation. We
propose that short-term abstinence or a new bone marrow stem cell/immunoregulatory cell mobilizing therapy
(MRG-001) may eliminate alcohol dysregulated neutrophils/innate immunity and promote allograft acceptance
and regeneration in alcohol fed recipients. In addition, transplantation of a genetically different liver may alter
alcohol use behavior. The following aims test these hypotheses. Our proposed studies involve: 1) evaluating the
impact of alcohol dysregulated neutrophils on allograft rejection and oxidative damage and to determine if short-
term abstinence or MRG-001 pretreatment eliminates alcohol dysregulated neutrophils following LT, 2)
developing a strategy for living donor ELT to promote regeneration and tolerance of small liver allografts, and 3)
determining if transplantation of a genetically different liver to alcohol-preferring (P) rats alters alcohol use
behavior. The knowledge generated from these novel studies will improve clinical outcomes by optimizing IS
therapy in patients with SAH after ELT, provide new insights in LDLT for patients with SAH and enable tolerance
for the allograft in patients with SAH."

This application for an Independent Scientist Award (K02) is designed to advance knowledge important for
understanding mechanisms of age-related changes at the NMJ and support the career of Dr. Sarah M. Greising,
PhD, an Associate Professor in the School of Kinesiology at the University of Minnesota. As the elderly
population of the United States continues to increase there is an ongoing scientific necessity to understand the
causes of neuromuscular dysfunction in old age. Understanding neuromuscular dysfunction requires
fundamental evaluations of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) the point of contact between a motor neuron and
skeletal muscle fiber. The NMJ initiates muscle contraction and allows physical movement including the ability
to breathe across the lifespan. Without innervation, muscle fibers cannot contract, significantly reducing function.
The overall objective of this K02 application is to characterize and correct neuromuscular deficiency and low
plasticity in the skeletal muscle following both aging and injury by evaluating if shared mechanisms of
destabilization of the NMJ exist. This proposal will capitalize on two pathologies that have limited regenerative
potential of skeletal muscle by evaluating the NMJ across the aging trajectory of mid- to old-age and following
volumetric muscle loss (VML), which is clinically identified as a chronic and irrecoverable loss of skeletal muscle
tissue resulting in functional impairments. Both aging and VML injury result in considerable neuromuscular
dysfunction, and chronic co-morbidities. My central hypothesis is that progressive NMJ destabilization in aged
and injured skeletal muscle create a hostile cellular environment in the muscle that mitigates plasticity and blunts
the effectiveness of interventions. I propose two specific aims to address these hypotheses: 1) To understand
the limits of diminished innervation and NMJ destabilization; and 2) To determine what spatial changes occur at
the NMJ during progressive destabilization. The results of the proposed studies will define cellular mechanisms
that contribute to the finite adaptive and regenerative capacity of the remaining muscle after injury and aging and
how this relates to NMJ destabilization. The stated goal of the K02 award is to foster the development of
outstanding scientists and enable them to expand their potential to make significant contributions to their field of
research. This K02 award will advance and reinvigorate Dr. Greising’s scientific development in aging biology
by providing protected time to: 1) to build preliminary data and a conceptual framework for a competitive NIA
R01-level grant proposal, 2) evaluate mechanisms of NMJ dysregulation in aged and injured skeletal muscle,
and 3) build my education and understanding of omics-based tools to develop collaborations able to ask and
answer impactful questions linking the physiology of the NMJ (my expertise) and these novel techniques
(collaborative expertise)."
10740882,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 20 million persons in the U.S. and is an independent risk factor for
cerebrovascular disease including stroke, microbleeds and cognitive impairment. The intestinal microbial
population is altered in CKD and there is increased production of bacterial-derived uremic toxins such as
indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). These toxins translocate into the
bloodstream and induce systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, and have been shown to disrupt the
endothelial barrier in vitro. Population studies have noted an association between higher levels of gut bacterial-
derived uremic toxins with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and CKD progression.
The current proposal examines the kidney-gut-brain axis: how uremic toxins from intestinal microbes contribute
to brain microbleeds in CKD. Microbleeds are an important predictor of future stroke and cognitive decline, and
are more common in CKD patients than in age-matched controls. Our central hypothesis is that indoxyl sulfate,
p-cresyl sulfate and TMAO induce oxidative stress, microglial activation and breakdown of cell-cell tight
junctions, leading to compromised blood-brain barrier integrity and microbleeds formation.
Our project will utilize interventions that raise or lower systemic levels of gut-derived uremic toxins in mice to
study brain microbleeds formation. Our research group has the necessary tools and expertise to complete the
proposed work including microbial 16S rRNA sequencing technology, small animal brain magnetic resonance
imaging, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics personnel.
Our Specific Aims are as follows:
Specific Aim 1: To determine the role of gut-derived uremic toxins on microbleeds formation in vivo.
Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of lowering specific gut-derived uremic toxins on brain
microbleeds pathophysiology in vivo.
We expect that our work will have an important positive impact by guiding the development of gut-directed
therapies to modify the CKD-cerebrovascular relationship."
10922807,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite their individual rarity, rare diseases collectively affect one in eleven Americans. Rare disease patients
often face significant diagnostic delays, waiting an average of 6 years from the onset of symptoms to an
accurate diagnosis. Recent advances in precision medicine have accelerated research in rare diseases,
overwhelming clinicians’ capacities to manage and leverage the latest knowledge efficiently in clinical practice.
For example, novel gene mutations related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) frequently do not appear in
the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) or other knowledge bases and are only present in initial articles.
Additionally, due to the lack of clinical evidence and empirical knowledge, awareness of rare diseases remains
low among healthcare providers and is a major reason for diagnostic odysseys experienced by many patients,
in practice.
Teaming up Mayo Clinic Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases (PRaUD) with the partnership of
Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), we aim to address the translation gap by building a novel end-
to-end informatics framework to accelerate the diagnosis of rare diseases. We plan to achieve the development
of the proposed framework through three specific aims. Aim 1 is to construct RDAccelerate, a computable rare
disease knowledge hub that accumulates and maintains up-to-date knowledge for rare diseases. It is costly to
stay current with the literature and informed with clinical evidence and empirical experience. To address this,
we will leverage the latest natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as pre-trained language models
(PLMs) and data mining techniques such as graph neural network (GNN) embeddings to accelerate the
extraction, integration, and mining of associations from a diverse range of resources. Aim 2 focuses on the
provision of RDRecommend, a deep phenotype-driven system for rare disease differential diagnoses trained
with the up-to-date knowledge in RDAccelerate and longitudinal patient records of rare disease cohorts. It often
takes substantial time and effort for an accurate diagnosis due to the rarity. We therefore propose to apply
various recommendation techniques to suggest rare disease differential diagnoses. We will then develop
RDConnect, a web portal to search information, display differential diagnostic recommendations, and collect
clinical evidence automatically for further validation in Aim 3. The proposed informatics framework will be
evaluated through several practice projects at PRaUD in collaboration with clinical co-Investigators. The
framework will be developed through team science collaboration using two rare diseases (IPF and
mastocytosis). We will then validate the framework in supporting two other rare diseases (hypereosinophilic
syndrome [HES] and rare kidney stone) before scaling up to a broad spectrum of rare diseases. The external
generalizability of the solution will be tested through our subsite partner VUMC. Successful completion of this
study will be significant as it addresses the translational gap faced in rare diseases through technology
innovations towards real-world challenges."

Influenza virus infections cause significant global morbidity and mortality and pose a serious pandemic risk due
to the virus’s propensity for reassortment and mutation. Current influenza vaccines elicit strain-specific
responses and are only 10-60% effective depending on the year. There is an urgent need for a universal
influenza vaccine that elicits robust, persistent, and broadly cross-reactive B and T cell responses. Designing
such a vaccine will require a comprehensive understanding of how features from both the host and the antigen
modulate the magnitude, quality, and breadth of the influenza-specific response. Most human influenza studies
have been limited to peripheral blood sampling, even though the critical cellular decisions that lead to productive
adaptive immune responses occur within lymphoid tissues. Our long-term goal is to define the dynamics of the
lymphoid tissue microenvironment, including cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways, that elicit protective
immune responses in humans. Our central hypothesis is that immune signatures from mucosal lymphoid tissue
are significantly more informative than peripheral blood in developing immunization strategies that elicit robust
and broadly cross-reactive influenza responses. To address this question, we propose to leverage a high
throughput in vitro organoid platform derived from primary human tonsil tissues. Tonsils are considered both
lymphoid and mucosal tissues; they are also accessible from otherwise-healthy patients undergoing
tonsillectomy for hypertrophy or obstructive sleep apnea. Participants are demographically diverse and cover
the full human age span; males and females are represented at similar proportions. Immune organoids derived
from tonsils accurately model human germinal center responses, specific antibody secretion, and T cell activation
in response to influenza antigens. They are also able to capture host-mediated inter-individual immune variation
related to patient age, sex, and immune history. Furthermore, tonsil organoids can be used to track the kinetics
of the adaptive immune response and enable the mechanistic insights needed to rationally design a universal
influenza vaccine. The goal of this application is to understand how host features and influenza antigen features
contribute to both the magnitude and quality of the influenza immune response in humans. This proposal is
supported by strong preliminary data and if successful, will open new areas of investigation for universal influenza
vaccine development by identifying correlates and predictors of protection. We will combine comprehensive
phenotyping and mechanistic experimental approaches to define the key drivers within human lymphoid tissues
that lead to narrow, strain-specific responses. The novelty of this application lies in the systems immunology
approach that integrates demographic, serological, phenotypic, functional, and repertoire readouts in a well-
controlled immune organoid platform. Completion of the proposed experiments will help us rapidly identify
correlates of protection and guide the design and testing of a broadly cross-reactive universal influenza vaccine."
10893610,"Project summary: Optimal oxygenation in neonatal lung injury
Whole-body hypothermia is currently the standard of care for moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy (HIE). HIE is commonly associated with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) and
persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Therapeutic hypothermia can cause
pulmonary vasoconstriction and exacerbate PPHN and is currently the leading indication for
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in California. The optimal target SpO2, and pulmonary
vasodilator regimen that results in improvement in both pulmonary and neurological outcomes in PPHN
and HIE is not known.
We hypothesize that targeting 95-98% SpO2 (compared to 91-95% - current standard of care) and
intravenous (IV) sildenafil will minimize brain injury and enhance pulmonary vasodilation. The first
specific aim focuses on changes in gas exchange and cerebral hemodynamics with two SpO2 target
ranges during 72-hours of whole-body hypothermia. The second specific aim focuses on oxidative stress
and neuroprotection offered by iNO and sildenafil following birth asphyxia during hypothermia and
ventilation at two different SpO2 targets. The final specific aim evaluates the impact of hypothermia on
pulmonary hemodynamics and pharmacokinetics of sildenafil.
Hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to MAS and PPHN is common during whole-body hypothermia.
Results from this study will inform the design of future clinical trials by defining the optimal SpO2,
temperature, and pulmonary vasodilators while managing neonates with PPHN and HIE. The therapeutic
potential of a commonly available and less expensive agent such as sildenafil in improving both
pulmonary and neurological outcomes following birth asphyxia will be explored in this proposal."
10738259,"Project Summary
 Inflammasomes are mega-Dalton protein complexes that initiate inflammation responses and play important
roles in the innate immune system. Upon activation, inflammasomes recruit and activate the effector protein
caspase-1. Caspase-1 in turn cleaves the Gasdermin D (GSDMD) protein to release its N-terminal domain, which
inserts into the cell membrane to punch holes on the cell surface. As a result, the host cell will undergo pyroptotic
cell death (pyroptosis) and release the cell contents into the extracellular environment. Pro-inflammatory
cytokines IL-1 and IL-18, both activated by caspase-1, will also be released to activate the downstream
inflammation reactions.
 NAIP is a family of cytosolic immunological receptors that activate the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasomes in
response to Gram-negative bacterial infections. There are seven NAIP proteins in mouse, each sense a specific
ligand such as Flagellin, Needle protein or Inner Rod protein in the type III secretion system. In previous studies,
we have shown active NAIPs activate NLRC4 through the nucleated polymerization mechanism. However, it is
still largely unknown about how NAIPs remain inactive in the resting cells, and how is the ligand specificity is
determined among different NAIPs. Unlike in mouse, humans only have one NAIP and it was shown to be
activated by all three bacterial ligands. This leads to many questions including what is the structural basis of the
broad detection of bacterial ligands by human NAIP and what does it tell us about the human inflammasomal
bacterial detection mechanism? To address these questions, we propose to combine electron cryo-microscopy
(cryoEM) with biochemical and functional studies to elucidate the structural mechanisms underlying the signal
transduction by NAIP proteins. Dysregulation of NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasomes causes macrophage activation
syndrome (MAS) and autoinflammation, and mutations of NAIP protein are highly correlated with spinal muscular
atrophy (SMA). The successful execution of this work will broadly advance the development of effective therapies
to treat infectious diseases, autoinflammatory diseases, SMA, and cancer through targeting the inflammasome
pathway."

in stark contrast with the textbook account that cortical receptive fields and maps develop through self-
organizing processes driven by structured, spontaneous activity in the LGN. To test our hypothesis, we
seek to investigate predicted correlations between the organization of the thalamocortical projection and
the receptive fields and tuning of cortical neurons. In Aim 1, we seek to determine if there is a link between
the spatial layout of ON/OFF domains, receptive field structure, and tuning in primary visual cortex. In Aim
2 we will classify and cluster thalamocortical boutons according to their responses to a rich set of visual
stimuli, allowing us to reconstruct the tiling of the visual field by different classes of geniculate neurons. We
will then study the spatial distribution and clustering of geniculate afferents into the cortex. Finally, in Aim
3, we will investigate a predicted correlation between the organization of thalamocortical projections and
cortical organization in single animals. We will achieve this by simultaneously imaging the activity of thalamic
boutons and cortical neurons using dual-color imaging. The proposed studies are significant as they test
the possibility that an imbalance between the ON and OFF responses from the periphery provides a scaffold
for the development of simple cell receptive fields and cortical columns. A positive outcome would prompt
a revision of our current views of the development of the cortical architecture."

Food insecurity among U.S. college students is alarmingly high. More than 30% of U.S. college students (over
6 million) experience food insecurity, and over 40% of California college students do so (~870,000). Current U.S.
college students are unlike those of previous generations. Contemporary students are nontraditional—from low-
income backgrounds, financially independent, and/or first in their families to attend college (first generation).
These characteristics put students at risk for food insecurity, with disparities in Black and Latino students. Food
insecurity in college students is associated with factors known to contribute to poor cardiovascular and metabolic
health (CVMH). Heart disease is also the 5th leading cause of death among 12 to 24 year olds, calling attention
to emerging adulthood (ages 18-26) as a critical period for modifying future risk of poor CVMH. The American
Heart Association (AHA) recently defined that ideal CVMH is based on Life’s Essential 8, which includes CVMH
behaviors (diet, physical activity, sleep, nicotine exposure) and factors (body mass index, blood glucose, blood
pressure, blood lipids). It is biologically plausible that food insecurity influences CVMH among college students
via several mechanisms, but there is limited knowledge in this area. Critical gaps include limited information
regarding: 1) the chronicity of food insecurity in college students, 2) emerging adulthood in the context of food
insecurity and CVMH, and 3) lack of objective assessment of CVMH. Longitudinal and objective information
about this relationship would provide a more comprehensive understanding of food insecurity as a modifiable
risk factor for CVMH
in a vulnerable student population of emerging adults
.
The overall objective of the proposed work is to improve our understanding of the impact of food insecurity on
risk for poor CVMH in emerging adults. We propose to recruit a randomly selected cohort of students (N = 563)
from UC Santa Cruz, a campus that reflects the diversity of U.S. college students. We will assess food insecurity
status monthly in Year 1 and CVMH annually over a 2-year period. CVMH will be determined by CVMH behaviors
and factors, as described by the AHA. Factors that are salient during emerging adulthood (family obligation,
parental and social support, stress) will also be assessed. We expect that more chronic food insecurity will predict
poor CVMH among students over time (Aim 1); poorer CVMH behaviors will mediate the relationship between
more chronic food insecurity and poorer CVMH factors (Aim 2); and the relation of SES and food insecurity will
be moderated by family obligation and supports, and the relation of food insecurity and CVMH behaviors with
CVMH factors will be mediated by stress (Aim 3). This project will address many concerns regarding food
insecurity and the potential CVMH disparities that exist among young adults in higher education. Food insecurity
as a modifiable target for CVMH prevention is biologically plausible and potentially high impact through new and
existing policy interventions."

Infection with the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm) is a common cause of
inflammatory diarrhea. Intriguingly, intestinal inflammation drives an expansion of the S. Tm population in the
gut lumen. The molecular mechanisms that support S. Tm colonization of the intestinal tract remain
incompletely understood. Our central hypothesis is that the inflamed gut constitutes a peculiar nutritional
environment that enables S. Tm to outgrow obligate anaerobic commensal bacteria. We have recently
demonstrated that during the acute phase of the infection, neutrophil-derived electron acceptors facilitate an
oxidative central metabolism in S. Tm. In this application, we hypothesize that S. Tm relies on a branched TCA
cycle for initial gut colonization. In particular, tartaric acid, produced through oxidation of microbiota-liberated
sugars, supports fumarate reduction in the branched TCA cycle. We will test key aspects of our hypothesis by
pursuing the following specific aims: 1.) determine how utilization of D- and L-tartrate contributes to growth of
S. Tm in the lumen of the mammalian large intestine, 2.) determine the origin of tartrate during S. Tm infection,
and 3.) investigate the regulation of tartrate utilization genes in vitro and in vivo. This work will advance our
understanding of how intestinal pathogens, such as S. Tm, adapt their carbon and energy metabolism to
colonize the mammalian intestinal tract. We envision that a better understanding of the mechanisms by which
S. Tm outgrows competing microbes during inflammation will aid the development of new and innovative
approaches for treatment."
10738819,"Project Summary/Abstract.
The broad, long-term goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the developmental
events that dictate cell fate decisions in formation of the synovial joint. Within this broad area, this proposal
focuses on the differentiation of articular cartilage, which plays a central role in maintaining the low-friction
environment of the joint space. Indeed, a hallmark of cells comprising the articular cartilage is their expression
of proteoglycans, such as the protein lubricin, encoded by the Prg4 gene, that lubricates the joint and protects
against the development of arthritis. Prg4 is specifically expressed in the superficial-most layer of the articular
cartilage. Findings by both the Lassar lab and others have established that Prg4-expressing cells in the superficial
zone of articular cartilage (in embryonic and early post-natal mice) serve as a stem cell population for all deeper
regions of the articular cartilage in the adult. Thus, to elucidate how the articular cartilage stem cell population
is both generated during development and maintained in the adult, a key objective of this proposal is to identify
the factors that regulate the expression of both Prg4 and other genes that are specifically expressed in the
superficial zone of the articular cartilage. Recent findings in the Lassar lab indicate that the transcription factor
Creb5 is uniquely expressed in superficial zone articular chondrocytes (as opposed to both deeper zone articular
chondrocytes and growth plate chondrocytes) and is a crucial regulator of Prg4 expression. Most notably, ectopic
expression of Creb5 in deep zone bovine articular chondrocytes (which do not expression Prg4) enabled TGF-b2
and EGFR signals to induce Prg4 expression in these cells, to a level equal to that expressed by superficial zone
articular chondrocytes. These findings suggest that Creb5 establishes a competent state in chondrocytes to
express Prg4 in response to these signaling pathways. In addition, the Lassar lab has found that mice engineered
to lack functional Creb5 fail to form many synovial joints, and that mis-expression of Creb5 throughout the limb
bud mesenchyme (with Prx1-Cre) results in a profound loss of growth plate development in long bones. Taken
together, these findings indicate that Creb5 plays a critical role in both the formation of synovial joints and is a
both a novel and crucial regulator of Prg4/lubricin expression in articular chondrocytes. This project will identify
both Creb5-dependent genes and the regulatory elements that drive the expression of these genes in primary
bovine superficial zone articular chondrocytes; and mechanistically determine how TGFb, EGFR, and p38
signaling modulate the transcriptional activity of Creb5 in these cells. In addition, this project will determine
how Creb5 regulates the formation of synovial joints, and elucidate how Creb5 expression in the epiphyseal
perichondrium blocks extension of the growth plate into the epiphyseal ends of the long bones."
10929427,"Understanding how cells respond to environmental changes is a fundamental task in systems biology and has
profound biomedical implications. Mathematical modeling on small network motifs using dynamical systems
theories has been successful on providing mechanistic insight and guidance, but generalization to a genome-
wide intertwined gene regulatory network is challenging. Single cell genomics approaches emerge as powerful
tools for studying cellular processes, but the destructive nature of most single cell techniques makes it
unfeasible to extract dynamical information of cellular processes. In addition, a number of grand challenges
impede further development of the field, such as trajectory inference, effect of various sources of errors on
data analysis, and validating and benchmarking tools for single cell measurements and analyses. The goal of
this proposed research is to tackle these challenges through integrating dynamical systems modeling into
single cell genomics analyses. The proposed research is based on recent advances in the single cell genomics
field that one can extract both transcriptome (x) and estimation of RNA velocity (i.e., instant time derivatives of
transcriptome, dx/dt) from single cell genomics data. We further developed a unified theoretical framework that
allows estimating the velocity information from various types of single cell data, and a machine learning based
computational pipeline of reconstructing systems biology equations for genomewide regulatory networks,
together with a computer package, dynamo, released to the community. This integration between single cell
genomics analyses and systems biology modeling provides quantitative mechanistic and dynamics
information. We propose to further develop our package and computational framework to address several
limitations in our published work. In Aim 1, we will first develop dynamo to interface with other single cell
analysis and dynamics modeling packages, and expand the types of single cell data to be analyzed. Then we
will develop and test a discrete dynamical model for full stochastic cellular dynamics based on the graph
representation of discrete vector fields. In Aim 2, we will first develop a systematic pipeline of integrating data
of multi-modality (e.g., ATAC-seq, DNA sequencing and binding site analyses, etc) and dynamo to identify
genetic codes of combinatorial function of transcriptional factors, the so-called composite elements in genetics.
Eukaryotic cells use a combination of a finite number of transcription factors to generate a large number of
different target gene regulation patterns. Cracking the genetic code at the genome-wide level is fundamental to
cell biology but challenging despite extensive efforts. Then we will expand the pipeline to reconstruct biology-
informed systems biology models for the genomowide gene regulation. We will evaluate the in silico
predictions from the model against several Perturb-seq datasets."

Project summary
Animal development and physiology require regular communication among cell types embedded in tissues.
Cellular communication commonly relies on signaling proteins, which can transit the space between cells and
relay information across a wide range of spatial scales from nanometers to meters. Proper control of signaling
range is strictly necessary during animal development, and dysregulation of signaling range can result in a
spectrum of embryonic lethal conditions or developmental disorders.
 The patterning gradient formed by a signaling protein reflects the signaling protein’s ability to travel
through the extracellular matrix, which is an amalgam of protein, sugar and lipids that organize cells in natural
tissues. Although signaling proteins are thought to diffuse from their source to their target, many proteins violate
the assumptions of free diffusion and instead show context-dependent differences in their signaling range. For
example, Sonic Hedgehog family developmental morphogens form signaling gradients over ~10µm in the testes,
~50µm in the developing neural tube or in adult hair follicles, and ~300µm in developing long bones. Notably,
tissues in which Sonic Hedgehog forms longer signaling gradients tend to express Scube family extracellular
matrix proteins, and Scube family proteins can dramatically extend Sonic Hedgehog signaling gradients in cell
culture.
 I suspect that tissue-specific differences in signaling range might reflect direct regulation of Sonic
Hedgehog’s diffusion rate, and that regulated diffusion of Hedgehog might reflect a broadly used strategy to
control the size of signaling gradients in animals. To understand how morphogens and the extracellular matrix
interact to generate appropriately sized signaling gradients, I will measure variation in protein diffusion both
between diverse signaling proteins, and between distinct extracellular environments. I will apply this mechanistic
understanding to discover how biochemical features of signaling proteins and the extracellular matrix result in
size variation among signaling gradients as well as morphological variation among the anatomical features that
they pattern. To that end, I propose the following specific aims:
 1) Understand how Scube family proteins modify hedgehog diffusion by tracking single particles of sonic
 hedgehog diffusing through the extracellular matrix.
 2) Discover which biochemical features of a signaling protein affect its diffusion rate through the
 extracellular matrix by developing synthetic morphogens, in which diffusion can be uncoupled from
 downstream signal transduction.
 3) Identify extracellular matrix modifiers of protein diffusion that contribute to tissue- or organism-specific
 signaling gradient size discrepancies by genetically simulating tissue-specific extracellular matrix
variation

10723240,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sarcopenic obesity is a debilitating condition that increases the risk of frailty, loss of autonomy, institutionalization,
and death in older adults. Currently, obesity medications and lifestyle/behavioral interventions have limited efficacy
for sarcopenia, worsening quality of life, and healthspan. As such, there is a critical need to identify and develop
treatment strategies for patients with sarcopenic obesity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are linked with several
age-related human diseases. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a critical factor contributing to the
development of sarcopenic obesity by mediating the decline in muscular fitness. To this end, genetic manipulation
of redox systems drives oxidative stress, altering mitochondrial integrity and function in aged skeletal muscle.
Oxidative stress also decreases the mitochondrial number and phosphorylation capacity while increasing
mitochondrial DNA mutations, ultimately resulting in organelle apoptosis. The nuclear factor erythroid-related 2
(NRF2) is a primary regulator of antioxidant and redox-regulating protein expression that maintains redox balance
across the lifespan. In fact, NRF2 expression in older adults is decreased and is associated with increased oxidative
stress and damage in skeletal muscle. Therefore, activation of NRF2 is a promising therapeutic approach for
several chronic diseases under oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial quality control, such as sarcopenic
obesity. This application will examine the role of NRF2 in sarcopenic obesity. The central hypothesis is that NRF2
dictates the mitochondrial quality control signaling, and its disruption exacerbates muscle loss by impairing
mitochondrial turnover and redox balance during sarcopenic obesity. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will test whether loss
of NRF2 regulates DRP1-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in skeletal muscle. I will conduct a series of in vitro
loss of function experiments of NRF2 in primary myotubes to assess mitochondrial fission activation and trafficking.
These experiments will contribute to our understanding of whether targeting NRF2 improves muscle function and
mass during sarcopenic obesity by regulating mitochondrial fission. For Aim 2 (R00 phase), I will determine whether
NRF2 is a master regulator of mitochondrial quality control signaling in skeletal muscle during sarcopenic obesity.
Here, we will use aged mice that are normal weight or have obesity with muscle-specific deletion of NRF2 treated
with or without a mitophagic flux inhibitor (Chloroquine). These experiments will identify whether loss of NRF2
blunts mitochondrial quality control, exacerbating oxidative stress in the muscle. This MOSAIC-K99/R00 NIH
Pathway to Independence Award will provide dedicated time and training to learn classic concepts of mitochondrial
biology, skeletal muscle cell culture techniques, and the generation of transgenic mice. These new skills will be
combined with my previous muscle biology skills to facilitate the implementation of an independent study during
the R00 phase. These studies will position me to achieve my long-term goal of directing an extramurally funded
research program that addresses skeletal muscle mitochondrial quality control during aging."
10726568,"Summary
Pancreatic cancer (PC) has the highest mortality of any cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%.
Despite progress in the development of targeted therapies, the survival rate is still unacceptably low. It is,
therefore, important to identify novel therapeutic approaches that could lead to a more effective treatment for
this malignant disease. This proposal explores the novel concept that a core 2 mucin synthesis gene, GCNT3,
regulates PC growth and survival, ascribing a new and critical role to GCNT3. We have shown that GCNT3
is overexpressed in PC patients and contributes to PC pathogenesis, indicating that GCNT3 is a promising
therapeutic target. However, how GCNT3 regulates PC is not clear. Using in silico small molecular docking
simulation approaches, we discovered that talniflumate is a novel inhibitor that selectively binds to GCNT3.
Examining the molecular mechanisms of GCNT3-mediated PC growth, we found that siRNA-mediated
knockdown of GCNT3 or treatment with talniflumate, inhibited xenograft tumors. Talniflumate also reduced
GCNT3 expression, leading to reduced production of mucins in vivo and in vitro, and improved cellular
gemcitabine uptake. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that targeting mucin biosynthesis through
GCNT3 may improve responsiveness to drug treatment.
 We, therefore, hypothesize that aberrant expression of GCNT3 will lead to excessive mucin synthesis
during PC development and cause chemoresistance. Hence, the inhibition of aberrant mucin synthesis is
sufficient to disrupt the barrier properties of the mucin mesh to efficiently increase the access of
chemotherapeutics to target sites. Three independent, yet interrelated, specific aims are proposed to address
this hypothesis. Aim 1: Generate GCNT3-deficient KPC mice and determine whether targeting GCNT3 ablates
the mucin barrier and inhibits PC progression/metastasis by increasing gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (NPT)
efficacy. Aim 2: Determine whether combinational therapy of talniflumate plus NPT are effective in treating PC
by a) evaluating the efficacy and dose-response effects of the combination administered in vivo in a clinically
relevant KPC model of spontaneous PC and b) determining mucin disruption and gemcitabine or NPT uptake
in combination-treated tumors. c) We will establish the GCNT3 and NPT levels in tumor tissue and their
correlation with mucin subtypes (Mucs) and PC treatment efficacy via whole genome transcriptome
sequencing and PET imaging. Aim 3: We will investigate the role of GCNT3 in gemcitabine resistance, mucin
overexpression and PC growth. a) For clinical relevance, we will assess the inhibition of human patient-
derived xenografts (PDX) and PC slice cultures by combinational therapy. b) Evaluate the efficacy of
combination against GCNT3 overexpressing human PC PDX tumors in vivo.
 Veterans Health Relevance: Pancreatic cancer major health problem and many veterans and their
families suffered from this neoplastic disease. The results obtained from this study will have high impact, since
they will shed light on future development of novel therapeutic strategies for PC. Thus, this proposal is highly
translational in nature"

People of Asian, Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander (AsA-NHPI) ancestry, while representing 7.7% of the US
population, have been largely underrepresented from NIH-funded prospective epidemiologic studies. As a
result, there are large gaps in our knowledge of the burden and causes of cardiovascular, metabolic, and
mental health disorders in these populations. Individuals of these backgrounds have experienced, to varying
degrees, the barriers, stresses, and stereotyping experienced by other minorities while also having challenges
that are unique to them. Understanding the heterogeneity of their lifestyles and societal and environmental
circumstances, as well as their ancestry, is a critical first step in determining their health needs and how to
address them. The heterogeneity in these populations, followed longitudinally and contrasted with other
populations, may add unique insights into the etiology of both physical and mental health conditions. In this
application for the Hawaiian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander Coordinating Center (HAAPI-CC), we
propose to: (1) Bring exceptional scientific, statistical, and cultural expertise to the effort of assessing the
physical and mental health and their determinants in people of Hawaiian, Asian, and Pacific Islander ancestry;
(2) Provide the operational, data science, and biorepository infrastructure and leadership to support the
scientific priorities of the cohort and stimulate and enhance ancillary study opportunities broadly; (3)
Coordinate and support Clinical or Community Field Center (CCFC) activities to enhance recruitment and
retention and broader community engagement; and (4) Enhance career development of early stage
investigators, particularly those from under-represented backgrounds. Through this effort, we can estimate the
prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors and mental health conditions, study their interplay and
trajectories over time, and examine associations with novel exposures derived from data linkages and
biospecimens. We anticipate leading a number of ancillary studies to obtain additional rich data from novel
sources (wearables, mHealth, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiome, cardiac and brain imaging).
Through these efforts, we and our CCFC colleagues, will advance the knowledge of the health conditions of
Asian, Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders and provide the infrastructure for deeper understanding of their
biological, environmental, and sociological underpinnings.

10907757,"LAGIER-TOURENNE WARD BLAINEY – ABSTRACT
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are two interrelated and uncurable
neurodegenerative disorders. Mutations in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP-43 and FUS cause familial
forms of ALS/FTD, and mislocalization of these proteins are pathological hallmarks of disease. Loss of function
of RBPs occurs concurrently with their mislocalization, and can result in profound mis-splicing of pre-mRNA
transcripts such as the expression of cryptic exons. This mis-splicing frequently leads to reduced expression of
the impacted genes and downstream functional consequences on neuronal biology. We and others have
identified and functionally characterized several mis-spliced genes that occur in TDP-43-related FTD/ALS, such
as STMN2 and UNC13A. However, we poorly understand the functional relationships between different disease-
associated RBPs or the diversity of pathological mis-splicing across different cell types. We also do not know
what causes mis-localization of RBPs in FTD/ALS, nor do we know how to reverse pathological mis-splicing
once it occurs. In this proposal, three research teams led by Clotilde Lagier-Tourenne, Michael Ward, and Paul
Blainey will bring together complementary backgrounds and technologies to address these outstanding
questions. Using iPSC-based cellular models of six disease-relevant cell types and cutting-edge long read RNA
sequencing methods, we will characterize how splicing is altered by the loss or gain of function of five FTD/ALS-
associated RBPs (Aim 1). We will then analyze splicing changes associated with mislocalization of two of these
RBPs, TDP-43 and FUS, in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia from FTD/ALS patient brains (Aim 2). Next, we
will perform FACS-based CRISPRi and optical pooled genetic screens in iPSC neurons, astrocytes, and
microglia to identify modulators of pathological splicing, and upstream drivers of RBP mislocalization and
dysfunction (Aim 3). Finally, we will target upstream regulators to reverse pathological splicing followed by
functional assays to determine the relationship of new splice modulators to disease in FTD/ALS iPSC-derived
cellular models (Aim 4). Collectively, these studies will reveal fundamental mechanisms underlying pathological
splicing in FTD/ALS, generate foundational datasets for the research community, and identify therapeutically
targetable modulators of pathologic splicing and upstream drivers of RBP dysfunction."

Ehrlichia chaffeensis (E. ch.) is a gram-negative, obligately intracellular bacterium and the etiologic agent of
human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME), an emerging, life-threatening, tick-borne zoonosis. E. ch.
preferentially infects mononuclear phagocytes and survives intracellularly by subverting innate immune defenses
mediated in part by tandem repeat protein (TRP) effectors. Within the last decade, our laboratory has identified
a multitude of molecular ehrlichial TRP-host interactions, many that are new to science, illuminating the breath
and complexity of pathogen-host interaction dynamics that occur during infection. We have shown that E. ch. is
dependent on activation of conserved eukaryotic signaling pathways including Notch and Wnt for infection.
However, understanding the molecular basis of Notch activation events, whereby E. ch. repurposes Notch
signaling for infection remains a major gap in our knowledge. Thus, the purpose of this investigation is to define
the molecular and cellular mechanisms E. ch. has evolved to repurpose Notch signaling for infection. We propose
that E. ch. TRP120 has distinct eukaryotic protein interaction modules known as short linear motifs (SLiMs) that
mimic Notch ligand function and directly engage cognate receptors to exploit Notch signaling for infection. This
investigation will address our limited understanding of the functionally diverse roles of protein interaction modules
in the continuum of host-pathogen interactions and cellular reprogramming. The long-term goal of this research
is to define the molecular basis of Ehrlichia host cell mimicry, and the mechanisms involved in infection and
immune evasion. The objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular interactions involved and functional
mechanisms whereby E. ch. TRP120 Notch ligand mimicry establishes and promotes infection by inhibiting host
cell apoptosis. We hypothesize that E. ch. TRP120 has a Notch SLiM mimetic that activates Notch signaling to
upregulate anti-apoptotic regulators (MCL1 and NICD), thereby inhibiting mitochondrial apoptotic signaling and
caspase activation. Aim 1 will define the E. ch. TRP120 Notch SLiM mimetic and investigate receptor binding
and signaling; Aim 2 will examine E. ch. TRP120 Notch-upregulated MCL1 inhibition of mitochondrial apoptosis;
and Aim 3 will investigate the role of E. ch. Notch stabilization of XIAP and inhibition of caspase activation. This
investigation will extend our knowledge of the molecular interactions by which E. ch. TRP120 surface protein
exploits Notch signaling to inhibit apoptosis and promote host cell survival and infection. The significance of this
research is defining the mechanistic strategies whereby intracellular pathogens with small genomes and a limited
number of effector proteins, have evolved host mimicry modules to repurpose host cell signaling to manipulate
downstream host defense mechanisms for infection. A molecular understanding of E. ch. pathobiology will also
facilitate development of novel therapeutic approaches for Ehrlichia spp. and intracellular pathogens that utilize
SLiM mimicry or exploit conserved cellular pathways for infection and immune evasion."
10730542,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Antigen receptor signaling to NF-κB is a highly regulated, critical pathway for B and T lymphocyte activation
during the adaptive immune response. NF-κB controls many genes required for lymphocyte function including
genes that promote proliferation and survival. The inappropriate activation of NF-κB is associated with multiple
lymphomas, which frequently acquire mutations in signaling molecules that elicit their receptor-independent
constitutive NF-κB activity. CARD11 is a key scaffold protein that functions in both T cell receptor and B cell
receptor pathways to transmit signals from the engaged receptor to the activation of the IKK complex and NF-
κB. Aberrant CARD11-dependent signaling is required for the dysregulated proliferation of the activated B cell-
like (ABC) subtype of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), and mutations in CARD11, which
hyperactivate the protein, are found in ~10% of patient samples of ABC DLBCL. Previous work has established
that during normal signaling, CARD11 undergoes a transition from an inactive to an active signaling scaffold
that recruits several signaling cofactors into a complex that induces IKK activity. An Inhibitory Domain (ID) in
CARD11 controls this transition; it keeps CARD11 inactive in the basal state, but receives signals from the
engaged receptor that neutralize its inhibitory action and allow CARD11 to signal. Lymphoma-associated
mutations in CARD11 bypass normal activation and convert CARD11 into a constitutively active signaling
scaffold. However, it remains poorly understood how during normal antigen receptor signaling CARD11 is
converted to its active state, how precisely normal and oncogenic forms of CARD11 signal to the IKK complex
to activate NF-κB, and how DLBCL-associated gain-of-function CARD11 alleles achieve the transformation of
normal B cells into lymphoma. In this application we will 1) investigate how signaling potential and cooperating
mutations determine the extent of oncogenic CARD11-mediated aberrant B cell proliferation in vivo; 2)
investigate the role of a newly identified factor required for CARD11 activity in normal and oncogenic antigen
receptor signaling; and 3) dissect determinants required for several steps in the CARD11 signaling cycle. Our
studies will advance understanding of the mechanisms of antigen receptor signaling during lymphocyte
activation, illuminate how signaling proteins, especially scaffolds, achieve signal-induced activation during
normal physiological behavior, and improve our understanding of how the combination of genetic lesions found
in lymphoma determines disease severity. Our studies should reveal a previously unrecognized molecular
target for the development of new therapies designed to treat NF-κB-dependent cancers and other diseases
that result from aberrant immune cell behavior."

 Obesity, glucose and insulin resistance, and other metabolic disorders are on the rise due in part to the
growing aged population. Dietary interventions such as calorie restriction (CR) can improve and even reverse
these complications but CR diets are difficult for most people to adhere to. Alternative regimens based on
restriction of specific macronutrients, such as protein restriction (PR) or limitation of specific essential amino
acids, have shown promise in improving metabolic health and extend lifespan without needing to limit of
calories.
 I and the Lamming lab have shown that Isoleucine restriction (IleR) improves glucose homeostasis,
improve body weight and adiposity, and even extends the lifespan of mice. IleR induces fibroblast growth
factor 21 (FGF21), an energy expenditure hormone and some but not all of the documented benefits of IleR
are dependent on FGF21. During the F99 phase, I will determine for the first time if FGF21 is required for
lifespan extending effects of IleR by using a mouse model of whole body FGF21 knockout. I will also test the
necessity of mTORC1 in the adipose and skeletal muscle – two key sites of isoleucine catabolism – on IleR
benefits by deleting Raptor specifically in the skeletal muscle or adipose tissue. This study will nicely bridge the
gap between my graduate and postdoctoral work as I shift my focus from whole body metabolism and
physiology to biology of aging muscle.
 In the K00 phase, I will utilize a validated mouse model of resistance exercise training to determine the
interaction between training and the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin on skeletal muscle outcomes, such as
muscle mass, fiber type, strength and mitochondrial respiration in both male and female mice of middle and old
age, as well as organismal outcomes including frailty. I will also utilize banked tissues to examine muscular
outcomes in older humans from a randomized clinical trial of everolimus Dr. Konopka has received funding for.
Finally, I will conduct an exploratory analysis of the interaction between skeletal muscle health, everolimus,
and dietary components based on the diet recall collected for each participant in the clinical trial. Completing
these aims will bring me one step closer to my goal of becoming a well-rounded independent researcher
conducting meaningful research on nutrition and metabolism in aging."
10897043,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, and lung cancer screening has been
demonstrated to effectively reduce lung cancer by 20-26% in eligible patients. Despite 10 years of
recommendations endorsing screening, evidence suggests that real-world implementation of screening along
the care continuum has been poor. Specifically, prior work reveals that adherence to routine annual screening
and specialized follow-up after positive lung cancer screening exams is suboptimal, with a median adherence
of 40-60% across clinical programs. Follow-up after either negative or positive lung cancer screening is a
critical target to achieve mortality benefits seen in clinical trials, as adherence to follow-up was >90% in these
studies, and more than half of all screen-detected lung cancers were diagnosed in follow-up.
 Prior studies of adherence to follow-up been largely observational, single center and performed in academic
settings, but have demonstrated that clinical lung cancer screening programs which contain centralized
program-level interventions such as care coordination have two-to-three times the rate of follow-up adherence
compared to programs where lung cancer screening is largely managed by primary providers. Prior
observational work also suggests centralized programmatic interventions may mitigate health disparities in
lung cancer screening. It is therefore critical to prospectively evaluate feasible and effective centralized
program interventions in community settings to translate the benefits to screening programs and patients.
 To fill this important knowledge gap, the central objective of this study is to generate evidence of barriers
and facilitators to lung cancer screening follow-up in decentralized community programs, adapt and introduce
centralizing interventions in these settings and rigorously measure the effectiveness and implementation of
these interventions. This objective will be met by achievement of three specific aims performed at 3 non-
academic regional partnering sites with large rural and Hispanic populations. In the first aim, we will determine
system-, provider- and patient-level facilitators to LCS follow-up in these settings using an innovative rapid
ethnographic approach supplemented by semi-structure interviews. In the second aim, we will adapt and
evaluate centralizing interventions including defined care pathways and after-screening care coordination
measuring the impact on adherence and socioeconomic, rural-urban and racial-ethnic disparities. Finally in the
third aim, we will evaluate the implementation of these strategies with a key focus on the tension between
fidelity and adaptations as these interventions mature. The aims will be grounded in an integration of the
Consolidative Framework of Implementation Research, RE-AIM and a NIH-developed health disparities
framework. Our team has extensive experience in lung cancer screening implementation and disparities with
expertise in adapting and evaluating pragmatic interventions in community settings. This project will generate
essential knowledge to improve lung cancer screening follow-up in real-world clinical programs."

Acute leukemia is a leading cause of death in the young. The goal of my research program is to identify the
genomic drivers of leukemogenesis and treatment failure, and through experimental modeling gain mechanistic
insight to enable the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, and ultimately improve cure
rates for this disease. In the last project period, I identified multiple subtypes of leukemia that led to a revision of
the molecular taxonomy of acute lymphoblastic and lineage ambiguous leukemia; I defined the relationship of
genomic variegation and clonal evolution in leukemia; I demonstrated the role of liquid-liquid phase separation
in leukemogenesis; and I developed new therapeutic approaches using targeted protein degradation directed at
intractable drivers of high-risk leukemia. In this proposal, the original overarching goal remains unchanged, but
my research program will address several conceptually new areas of research that have been stimulated by my
prior discoveries. These include (1) defining the mechanism by which enhancer deregulation drives
leukemogenesis in T-lineage ALL; (2) investigating how concomitant LMO2-activating and STAG2-inactivating
alterations perturb chromatin state to drive leukemogenesis, and how this may be exploited for therapeutic
benefit; (3) elucidating how BCL11B deregulation primes primitive hematopoietic cells for lineage ambiguous
leukemia; (4) determining how fusion oncoprotein-driven liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) drives chromatin
and transcriptional deregulation in leukemogenesis, and how this may be targeted for therapeutic benefit; and
(5) developing molecular glue-based targeted protein degradation strategies to improve cure rates for childhood
leukemia. These research areas explore central questions in childhood and adult leukemia, including the
mechanisms by which enhancer hijacking/deregulation events drive leukemogenesis, the basis of cell lineage
ambiguity in lineage ambiguous leukemia, the mechanistic role of LLPS in leukemogenesis, and the efficacy of
innovative therapeutic approaches to degrade intractable drivers of acute leukemia. To achieve these goals I will
use innovative experimental approaches including novel engineered mouse models, single cell barcoding and
lineage tracing, multiomic gene expression-chromatin profiling, LLPS-condensate profiling, and exploitation of a
unique small molecule library of molecular glues. This research program will be facilitated by collaborations with
colleagues with expertise in these approaches. Collectively, these approaches will yield fundamental mechanistic
insight and therapeutic advances that will improve cures for currently intractable high risk leukemias."
10739722,"Background and Significance: Through the Shallow Subsidy component of the Supportive Services for
Veteran Families (SSVF) program, Veterans and their families living in high cost-of-living locations in the US
who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of becoming homeless can receive up to 2 years of rental
subsidies and job training through non-profit organizations in the community. The goal of the program is for
Veterans to achieve long-term financial self-sufficiency through employment and housing stability. The impact
on Veteran housing, healthcare cost, and health outcomes as well as Veteran satisfaction with this program is
not known.
 Poverty has a devastating effect on Veterans’ health and well-being. In addition, homelessness can be
costly both to the healthcare system and society as a whole. Solving the problem of long-term Veteran financial
and housing instability is one of the most important initiatives the VA is currently pursuing.
Innovation: Our study – evaluating a program implemented in 15 different communities in the US – will be the
largest to examine the impact of long-term financial support for individuals facing housing instability in the US.
In addition, we will use both structured and unstructured data and detailed, Veteran-level data on services and
financial assistance received by Veterans enrolled in this program. Finally, we will join VA clinical data with tax
filings data available through the US Department of the Treasury to estimate the impact of Shallow Subsidies
on income and employment outcomes.
Specific aims: Aim 1: Identify barriers and facilitators to implementation and use of the Shallow Subsidy
program using semi-structured interviews with VA operations partners, SSVF grantee employees, VA
homeless services providers, and Veterans using the Shallow Subsidy program. Aim 2: Describe and identify
predictors of the amount of financial support for Veterans enrolled in the Shallow Subsidy program for FY2020-
FY2023 using HMIS, VA administrative, and publically-available community-level data. Aim 3: Perform an
outcome and economic assessment of the Shallow Subsidy program. 3a: Measure the impact of this program
on housing, income, employment, health, and healthcare cost outcomes through retrospective cohort analyses
for FY2020-FY2023. 3b: Conduct economic evaluations of the Shallow Subsidy program compared to standard
SSVF and usual care using input parameters from the published literature and from Aims 2 and 3a.
Methodology: In Aim 1, we will conduct interviews with national VA stakeholders, SSVF grantee employees,
VA homeless service providers, and Veterans who have enrolled in the SSVF program. In Aim 2 we will
construct multi-level regression models to identify both individual- and community-level predictors of Shallow
Subsidy use and expenditures. In Aim 3a, we will fit outcome models relating Shallow Subsidy program
initiation to the subsequent mortality, exit from homelessness, income, employment, and cost outcomes in
weighted populations defined by propensity scores. In Aim 3b, we will construct simulation models using input
parameters from a variety of sources.
Next steps/Implementation: This research will be an important building block for future studies. We will work
with our operations partners to design studies to implement and assess the policy recommendations from this
study to enhance the Shallow Subsidy program. This information will be especially important as the SSVF
program office is considering expanding the Shallow Subsidy program to other communities throughout the
country. In addition, in future analyses we will examine the impact of health conditions (such as traumatic brain
injury, combat injury, and opioid misuse) and interventions to address these conditions on income and
employment. Through this portfolio of research projects, we will help VA efficiently deliver services to improve
the lives of vulnerable Veterans."
10739723,"Background: There is increased attention on social determinants of health (SDOH) as a result of
empirical evidence showing that the patient’s social background is associated with their health
behaviors and clinical outcomes. Now more than ever, health care systems (HCS) are being held
accountable for addressing social factors. Improving the quality of health care among racial and ethnic
minorities is a VA is a top priority.
Significance/Impact: Ideally, identifying and documenting a patient’s social background would be
followed by referral to services that address the SDOH that are most likely to reduce compliance with
recommendations for disease prevention, treatment, and management. However, SDOH such as
education, income, social isolation, and financial strain are rarely documented during routine care visits.
A more systematic approach that leverages health information technology is needed to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of identifying social determinants among patients in the VA so that more
targeted approaches are used to address these risk factors in the patients’ communities. A better
understanding of SDOH within the electronic health record (EHR) is needed in order to improve
population health management and processes for referring patients to social services.
Innovation: The first step to developing a more robust data-driven strategy for identifying social
phenotypes among patients is to understand the extent to which SDOHs are being documented in the
EHR. Natural language processing (NLP) is one strategy to automatically extract those data from
clinical notes in the EHR into a structured format that can be used to examine the quality of health care
and facilitate the development and implementation of quality improvement strategies. However, NLP
approaches alone are not sufficient to improve the quality of health care for Veteran racial/ethnic
minorities. This is because poor quality communication between patients and providers and greater
distrust in the health care system among minorities may limit discussion of these factors. Novel deep
learning approaches have not been fully leveraged in the identification of patients at risk for adverse
SDOH. Moreover, there is a lack of empirical data on the concordance between patient self-reported
SDOH and those extracted using NLP. Even less is known about the value associated with obtaining
and documenting SDOH on patient outcomes. Therefore, we propose to develop a multilevel health
informatics approach for identifying social phenotypes among primary care patients based on
documentation of SDOH in the EHR as part of the following:
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Use deep learning strategies to identify social phenotypes among diabetes
patients based on documentation of SDOH in the EHR. Aim 2: Examine the concordance between risk
factors for SDOH identified using NLP and patient-self- report. Aim 3: Conduct a study to evaluate the
effects of documenting SDOH on patient outcomes.
Methodology: A deep learning NLP approach will be used to characterize the rates at which SDOH are
documented in the EHR. Machine learning strategies will be used to identify social phenotypes based
on SDOH.
Implementation/Next Steps: We predict that Veterans who have SDOH documented in the EHR will
report better clinical outcomes, greater trust in health care providers, and better patient-physician
communication compared to Veterans who do not have SDOH documented in their EHR. We will also
characterize referrals to clinic- and community-based services based on the patient’s social phenotype."
10918222,"SUMMARY
Microphthalmia, anophthalmia and coloboma (MAC) are a group of clinically and genetically related eye defects
that cause significant visual impairment. MAC can be caused by pathogenic variants in transcription factors and
other genes involved in eye development and by environmental factors such as maternal vitamin A deficiency
(VAD). Vitamin A is critical for retinoic acid (RA) synthesis and pathogenic variants causing loss or gain of function
for the genes in the RA pathway, such as STRA6, can result in severe MAC. We hypothesize that genetic variation
in the RA pathway genes and genes involved in retinol metabolism can result in a predisposition, or lower
threshold, for the deleterious effects of VAD on eye development that contributes to the phenotypic severity of
MAC. This gene-environment interaction is highly relevant for countries where VAD is common and remains a
public health concern, such as India. In addition, the downstream genes that are dysregulated by lack of vitamin
A are poorly understood and are amenable to study in animal models. To identify the full spectrum of genetic
variation in the RA pathway and other genes in patients with MAC, our first Aim will recruit patients with MAC
and perform detailed phenotyping, environmental screening, and imaging so that we can generate accurate
phenotype genotype correlations. We will generate, analyze and compare whole genome sequencing (GS) data
from our collaborators, Dr. Tibrewal and Dr. Kumar, in patients of Asian ancestry with our studies using GS in
patients with MAC of predominantly European ancestry. We will also prospectively recruit patients with MAC
diagnosed in the newborn period from centers in the USA, so that we can obtain retinol levels from umbilical cord
blood in babies with MAC and retinol levels in maternal plasma around the time of delivery. With this data, we
will compare the severity of MAC with sequence variants that we observe in the RA pathway genes and in other
eye developmental genes, for patients of different ancestries, with and without evidence of VAD from symptoms
or from low levels of retinol. In our second Aim, we will use gene-editing with Clustered Regularly Interspaced
Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas9 to determine the effects of altered function for stra6 and other genes in the RA
pathway on ocular morphogenesis in zebrafish. All crispants will have detailed phenotyping at different timepoints
during eye development, including gene expression studies with single cell RNA-Seq, to determine the
downstream genes that are regulated by RA. We will also investigate if we can rescue, or partially rescue, the
deleterious effects of genetic variants in stra6 and other genes causing MAC on eye morphogenesis by titrating
levels of RA and retinol during periods of ocular development in Danio rerio. With this Aim, we will use an animal
model to generate data regarding downstream genes, tissues and developmental timepoints that are affected by
deficiencies of RA and vitamin A. Our overall purpose is to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of MAC
to develop targeted prevention strategies and therapeutics for children affected by these devastating birth defects."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive tumor type with poor prognosis due to the diverse etiology,
tumor heterogeneity, and the frequent late stage diagnosis. HCC is the fourth cause of cancer-related deaths in
the world and is seen at higher rates among Hispanics, Blacks, and Asian Pacific Islanders compared with non-
Hispanic whites. In the U.S, the rate of death from liver cancer has increased >40%. The proto-oncogene MYC
is deregulated in ~80% of HCC. Yet, MYC remains to be an undruggable target. Although, the most common
alteration is gene amplification (~30%), a significant proportion of MYC-driven HCCs have deregulated MYC
signaling without concomitant MYC gene amplification. How MYC signaling is deregulated in HCC without
concomitant MYC gene amplification is not understood. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular basis
for this phenotype to develop therapies to indirectly target MYC as a therapeutic strategy in HCC. The specific
objective of this proposal is to confirm Negative Elongation Factor E (NELFE) as a central regulator of MYC
signaling to promote HCC. The central hypothesis is deregulated NELFE modulates MYC signaling to promote
HCC regardless of MYC status. We recently discovered the NELFE is over-expressed in 48% of HCC and is
required for MYC-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Preliminary data indicate NELFE alters nucleosome
accessibility to modulate MYC-signaling. Moreover, we found NELFE localizes in the nucleus as biomolecular
condensates, membraneless organelles that modulate transcription. Perturbation of NELFE condensates alters
protein-protein interactions important for MYC signaling, suggesting NELFE condensation as a novel mechanism
for MYC-induced HCC. We discovered a novel truncated NELFE isoform with anti-tumorigenic effects in
advanced HCC. Isoform switching from FL NELFE to the truncated form via antisense oligonucleotides
significantly reduced tumorigenic phenotypes and condensates. Here, we will use biophysical, biochemical, in
vitro and in vivo assays to elucidate the role of NELFE on chromatin accessibility and biomolecular condensates
as promoters of HCC through MYC signaling. Furthermore, we will use our established genetic models and
antisense oligonucleotides to test the critical anti-tumorigenic function of the truncated NELFE isoform in HCC.
Together, our proposed studies will define the novel role NELFE as a regulator of MYC as an essential player in
the pathophysiological mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis and establish the function of the novel truncated
NELFE protein."

 Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone and soft tissue cancer impacting children and
adolescents worldwide. It is an aggressive malignancy requiring multimodal treatment that confers significant
morbidity, and cure rates for metastatic and relapsed disease remain poor. While Ewing sarcoma is
characterized and driven by EWSR1-ETS gene fusions, the biological factors contributing to these simple
rearrangements, and complex rearrangements known as chromoplexy in a subset of cases, are not well-
characterized. I found that inherited pathogenic variants in FANCC and other DNA damage repair (DDR)
genes are uniquely enriched among patients with Ewing sarcoma relative to other pediatric sarcoma subtypes
(Gillani et al., AJHG 2022). Much work is still needed to understand how DNA damage repair deficiency
contributes to Ewing sarcoma pathogenesis. The guiding hypothesis of this research proposal is that DNA
damage repair deficiency promotes Ewing sarcoma pathogenesis, manifesting as a unique pattern of
predisposing germline variants and tumor genomic features that are integral to oncogenesis and can
be utilized for more informed risk stratification and treatment.
 We will apply computational and experimental approaches to sequencing datasets from patients with
Ewing sarcoma and cell line models to complete this research proposal. In Specific Aim 1, we will dissect the
additive contribution of larger germline structural variants impacting DDR genes in Ewing sarcoma by
analyzing a cohort of 301 parent-proband trios and evaluating the enrichment of germline structural variants in
1180 cases relative to cancer-free controls. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the phenotype of FANCC variants
seen in the germline of Ewing sarcoma patients and knock these variants into mesenchymal stem cell lines to
understand how they contribute to genomic instability in the presence of genotoxic stress. In Specific Aim 3,
we will derive genomic signatures to gain additional insight into the DNA damage processes that are operant in
Ewing sarcoma tumors and associate copy number signatures specifically with treatment response and
relapse. Finally, we will conduct in-vitro drug treatment studies to demonstrate the utility of specific copy
number signatures as biomarkers of sensitivity to DNA damage response targeting agents.
 Through integrative investigations spanning the germline and tumor, we intend to drive new
understanding of how DNA damage operates in Ewing sarcoma pathogenesis, knowledge that will be central
to improved risk stratification and treatment of this aggressive pediatric cancer. Moreover, in extending our
broader understanding about germline structural variants, the role of heterozygous risk variants in cancer
predisposition, and copy number signatures as clinically relevant biomarkers, this work will also have high
relevance to other pediatric cancers."
10901994,"Project Summary/Abstract
One in 60 U.S. children has autism and many are at high risk for poor oral health – a problem that could be
addressed in part through improved toothbrushing. Technologies like mobile health apps are an ideal platform
to deliver toothbrushing interventions, but few app-based interventions have focused on teens with autism and
the work to date has critical limitations. Our team developed an interactive toothbrushing training app called
Brush Up, which incorporates concepts from Video Self Modeling. The app helps users develop toothbrushing
skills through repeated self-observation and interactions with a cartoon exemplar that reinforces correct
brushing. A front-facing (“selfie”) camera on the mobile device displays the child’s face and teeth. Children
brush in tandem with the cartoon exemplar. We tested the app with typically developing children ages 5 to 6
years and found significant improvements in toothbrushing duration after only one week of app use. We then
piloted the same app in individuals with autism ages 4 to 22 years. Caregivers of teens with autism were
particularly enthusiastic about the app and recommended ways to make the app more autism-friendly by
including features that account for sensory sensitivities common in autism. We further identified missing app
features that if included would increase the odds of long-term behavior change. In this 6-year UG3/UH3 grant,
we have 2 Aims: (1) Pilot the app-based intervention; and (2) Conduct a Stage II efficacy trial. During the 2-
year UG3 phase, we will use the Discover, Design+Build, and Test Framework to modify our existing app to
make it autism-friendly, develop a control app with only a digital mirror and timer, pilot the intervention with 40
adolescents with autism ages 10 to 17 years (Waisman score ≥21), and make necessary adjustments. In the
4-year UH3 phase, we will recruit 270 adolescents with autism, randomize participants to 1 of 2 arms, and
compare outcomes. The trial will last 3 months. The primary outcome is toothbrushing distribution, defined as
the mean proportion of tooth surfaces brushed during the last month of the 3-month intervention and measured
in each arm by the respective app. Secondary outcomes are toothbrushing duration and frequency. We
hypothesize adolescents in the experimental arm will exhibit better toothbrushing distribution, duration, and
frequency than those in the control arm. App data will be collected continuously during the 3-month trial and up
to 3-months post-trial. Survey data will be collected at baseline, 2 weeks, 1 months, 2 months, and 3 months to
assess mediators (e.g., self-efficacy) and exploratory outcomes (e.g., habit formation, quality of life). Post-trial
surveys will assess long-term change and interviews with 60 participants from the 2 arms will identify ways to
further improve the intervention. If found to be efficacious, our findings could address an unresolved problem
that affects over 1.2 million U.S. children and teens with autism. Our long-term goal is to develop
comprehensive strategies to prevent caries and reduce oral health inequities that affect teens with autism."

Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the US, with over 42,000 cases annually. There is an urgent need
to identify modifiable risk factors that can inform public health prevention strategies. This proposed research
seeks to leverage and integrate several existing datasets to support novel secondary analyses aimed at
identifying predictors, moderators, and mitigators of suicide risk from a life course approach. This proposal will
(1) Examine how major life transitions in four domains (e.g., social relationships, health, work/school, and
residence/moving) relate to suicide-risk behaviors and suicide mortality over the life span; and (2) Examine
individual-level moderators (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, mental health history, and medical comorbidities) of
the relationship between major life transitions and suicide risk over the life span; and (3) Examine how
contextual characteristics (e.g., neighborhood socioeconomic status, residential segregation, indicators of
social capital) moderate the relationship between major life transitions and suicide risk over the life span. This
proposed research will use two ongoing, nationally-representative longitudinal studies that collectively cover
adulthood: the Americans’ Changing Lives (ACL, ages 25+, surveyed six times since 1986) and the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS, ages 51+ surveyed biennially since 1992). The ACL and HRS have multiple measures
of suicide-risk behaviors and are being linked to the National Death Index (NDI) to identify suicide deaths. The
ACL and HRS have existing linkages to multiple external datasets which index macro-level contextual
characteristics. In addition, we will leverage restricted-access data from the National Violent Death Reporting
System (NVDRS), the most comprehensive registry of suicide mortality in the US (n~250,000 suicide deaths of
all ages from 2003-2018), which contains both quantitative and qualitative data on major life transitions in the
context of suicide mortality. We will link the NVDRS data using geographic identifiers to multiple external
datasets to characterize macro-level contextual moderators of suicide mortality. Impact: Empirical research on
the long-term influences of complex, intersecting and time-varying factors that contribute to suicide risk within
and across subpopulations is lacking. This project will address this gap in scientific understanding by providing
an innovative, integrated set of analyses that seek to comprehensively examine the ways that life transitions
intersect with individual and macro-level characteristics to shape suicide risk over the life span. Findings will
examine theorized but under-researched risk factors, clarify potential points of engagement, and inform
targeting and prioritization of existing preventive interventions."

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is among the most common indications for liver transplant (LT), accounting for
over 30% of LTs performed annually in the United States. Given concerns for post‐transplant recidivism,
transplant centers have required 6 months of documented sobriety prior to LT. However, a subset of patients
present for medical care with severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH), requiring urgent and aggressive medical
management. If they are unresponsive to medical treatment, LT is the only life‐saving option. Without LT, SAH
patients have a 70‐80% three‐month mortality, therefore a 6‐month sobriety rule precludes most patients from
life‐saving LT. We have demonstrated that early LT (ELT) for SAH provides excellent short‐term survival
and similar recidivism rates in comparison to LT for ALD with 6 months sobriety.
ELT for SAH is rare and controversial, because at many centers, the standard 6‐month sobriety period
is a transplant candidacy requirement. However, critics of this requirement emphasize that an unreliable
predictor of recidivism. In order to minimize risk to the public perception, careful analysis of ELT selection
criteria is crucial to ensure allocation to those with the greatest survival benefit and highest chance of
maintained sobriety. Ethically sound candidate selection criteria is paramount to identifying SAH patients who
would significantly benefit from ELT.
In this study we will identify social determinants of health (SDoH) affecting access to ELT and assess how
SDoH impact short- as well as long-term outcomes in ELT. We will also determine the ethical issues
surrounding the practice by evaluating stakeholder opinions regarding ELT for SAH, in an effort to develop a
comprehensive national policy. Further, we will examine recidivism in ELT recipients, comparing differing
behavioral and pharmacologic interventions to identify mitigating strategies. We will also continue the study of
explanted livers from patients undergoing transplant to identify the molecular-level changes characterizing the
pathophysiology of SAH. Lastly, we seek to utilize small animal models of liver transplantation in conjunction
with alcohol exposure to answer questions about liver regeneration, and the immune system that cannot be
answered directly from our patients. This work is now being conducted under the auspices of our “DELTA
Center” (Delivery of Early Liver Transplant for Alcoholic Hepatitis) at Johns Hopkins.
The identification of SDoH that affect access to ELT for will provide actionable areas for improving delivery of
this service to the most disadvantaged of an already vulnerable population. The ethical insight from
stakeholders will aid in the development of a national policy for the practice, and insights gained from
investigation of post-transplant recidivism interventions, explant pathology, as well as animal models of SAH,
will provide us with a more comprehensive understanding of the disease pathophysiology and management."
10740908,"Project Summary
Metastasis is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer with little improvement in outcomes over the
past decade. This is particularly evident in gastrointestinal cancers where metastasis to the liver is the most
common site of cancer cell spread. We hypothesize that the spread and growth of cancer cells in the liver is
dependent on formation of a reversible niche environment that is directed by hepatocytes, the chief functional
cells of the liver. In support of this hypothesis, we have found that primary tumors release soluble factors that
activate hepatocytes in the liver. This process begins during the earliest stages of cancer development. Activated
hepatocytes respond by releasing acute phase reactants which orchestrate a niche environment in the liver that
is underpinned by the recruitment of neutrophils and myeloid cells and the deposition of extracellular matrix
proteins. This environment supports cancer cell seeding and colonization. In the absence of this pro-metastatic
niche, disseminated cancer cells enter a state of cell dormancy in the liver. Although macrophages are a first-
line of defense against metastasis to the liver, their biology is also altered during formation of the niche
environment in the liver. Thus, our findings identify an intercellular network within the liver underpinned by
hepatocytes that responds to cancer development by preparing the “soil” that supports cancer cell “seeding”.
Our ultimate goal is to devise novel therapies that will resolve the pro-metastatic niche and redirect the liver
environment from pro- to anti-metastatic for treating and preventing cancer metastasis. However, this will require
an understanding of the signals by which hepatocytes direct formation of the niche and identification of strategies
capable of reversing the pro-metastatic potential of the niche. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will define the downstream
signals by which hepatocytes coordinate formation of a pro-metastatic niche in the liver. In Aim 2, we will identify
strategies to shift the niche environment in the liver from pro- to anti-metastatic. In Aim 3, we will investigate the
impact of hepatocytes on cancer cell dormancy in the liver and the efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Together,
these complementary aims will inform the development of therapies designed to condition the liver for anti-
metastatic potential as a strategy to prevent and treat cancer metastasis."
10734762,"Project Summary
 The global disease burden, particularly in the elderly population, is dominated by age-related chronic
diseases such as neurodegenerative disease, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes; these three
conditions alone accounted for over 850,000 American deaths in 2018. These conditions are highly heritable,
however the specific mechanisms linking genetics to age-related disease pathogenesis remain unclear.
Mitochondrial dysfunction, and more specifically, energy production impairment, is often invoked as a hallmark
of aging and age-related disease in humans and in model organisms. Despite pervasive associations, a rigorous
assessment of if mitochondrial dysfunction is causal for age-related diseases has yet to be performed. In fact,
the only disorders truly known to be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction are inherited mitochondrial diseases,
caused by genetic lesions in ~300 mitochondrial DNA- or nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial genes. In addition,
the cause of the mitochondrial dysfunction seen in aging and age-related disease remains unclear. In this study,
the candidate’s long-term goal is to investigate the mechanisms leading to mitochondrial dysfunction
and its causal link with aging and age-related common disease using natural human genetic variation.
AIM 1 will systematically assess the association between mitochondrial dysfunction and age-related disease
using novel and existing methods; AIM 2 will test for causation between mitochondrial dysfunction and age-
related disease using a novel measure of mitochondrial dysfunction; and AIM 3 will assess the genetic
mechanism of a readout of mitochondrial dysfunction by elucidating and investigating its genetic architecture.
Overall, this work will be the first comprehensive analysis of the mechanism and causal structure linking
mitochondrial dysfunction to human age-related disease. The results of this analysis have the potential to
uncover novel mechanisms underlying aging and common age-related diseases, potentially paving the way to
novel mechanism-based therapeutics.
 This work will be completed jointly in the well-resourced laboratories of Drs. Vamsi Mootha and Benjamin
Neale, benefiting from world-class expertise and mentorship in mitochondrial biology, age-related disease
biology, and statistical genetics as required for successful execution of the proposed work. In part by addressing
fundamental questions of relevance for the fields of aging, mitochondrial biology, and statistical genetics, the
candidate’s training plan will additionally important skills in written and oral communication, teaching and
mentorship, and clinical care. The highly collaborative expert scientific community at Harvard Medical School
will successfully prepare the candidate for a career as an academic clinician-scientist."
10734765,"Phase separation control of transcription in Ewing sarcoma
 Eighty-five percent of Ewing sarcomas are caused by translocations between the
genes EWS and FLI1, creating a powerful oncogene – EWS-FLI1. The remainder are
caused by translocations involving an EWS homologue, FUS. This sarcoma is an
aggressive primary bone tumor affecting 1 in 300,000 people annually with more than 80%
of tumors occurring in adolescents, making it the second most common pediatric bone
cancer. Half of known translocations identified in sarcomas involve one of a family of three
proteins – FUS, EWS, and TAF15, known as the FET family of proteins. Our work over
the last few years has contributed to expanding the model for FET protein regulation of
transcription. FET proteins control transcription in an organizational capacity. FET proteins
undergo an assembly process called phase separation, which is the process thought to
drive formation of non-membrane bound organelles, also called granules.
 In this proposal, we highlight our accomplishments isolating an EWS-FLI1 associated
granule from cells. These granules have considerable similarity to those we have
discovered to associate with RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) during transcription, which
we refer to as transcription granules. This proposal aims to establish a model that EWS-
FLI1 fusion protein seed aberrant granules that incorporate EWSR1 and other FET
proteins to alter transcription and promote tumorigenesis. Our proposed work will
investigate basic molecular mechanisms by which EWS-FLI1 can contribute and drive
pediatric sarcoma pathology. Our proposal involves three aims. (1) We will determine the
binding partners that comprise fusion protein granules for EWS-FLI1. (2) We will
investigate EWS-FLI1 and EWSR1 activities to bind nucleic acids, phase separate, and
alter transcription through effects on nucleic structures. Finally, (3) we will investigate how
changes to DNA structure and chromatin are linked to aberrant phase separation by EWS-
FLI1, EWSR1, and additional remodeling factors."
10734767,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal addresses a novel microglia-controlled neuronal activity feedback mechanism and its potential
contribution to aging-dependent neuropathology. Aging in mice and humans is associated with alterations to
neuronal circuit excitability and function, increased seizure susceptibility, and neurodegeneration. Our recent
studies have identified microglia as novel regulators of neuronal activity and function, maintaining homeostatic
levels of neuronal activation, thereby serving as brake pads for hyperexcitation. Preliminary evidence suggests
this neuroprotective function may be altered in aging, potentially as a consequence of inflammatory microglia
activation associated with aging and neurodegenerative disease. I hypothesize that microglia play a critical role
in aberrant neuronal responses and dysfunction in the aging brain. In support of this idea, we found that microglia
are able to regulate neuronal activity in an activity dependent manner by responding to ATP released during
neuronal activation and metabolizing it into adenosine, thereby suppressing neuronal activity. We further found
that age-associated increase in pro-inflammatory gene expression in microglia is associated with changes in this
mechanism. To investigate my hypothesis, I will first elucidate the exact mechanisms of microglia-mediated
neurosuppression, using the healthy adult striatum as a model. Microglia express the rate-limiting enzyme, CD39,
which controls ATP to AMP degradation, while AMP to adenosine degradation is accomplished by CD73, which
is expressed in microglia but also by striatal D2 medium spiny neurons. This suggests that microglia may either
be independently sufficient to produce adenosine by expressing both CD39 and CD73, or this mechanism
requires microglia-neuron interactions. To investigate this, we propose to generate transgenic mouse models to
identify the relative contributions of CD73 found on microglia versus D2 medium spiny neurons. Microglial
sufficiency of adenosine production may implicate this as a brain-wide mechanism of neuroprotection against
aberrant neuronal activation. Additionally, to investigate the presynaptic and postsynaptic specificity of this
microglial mechanism, we will use transgenic mouse models lacking adenosine receptor either on projection
neurons or D1 medium spiny neurons. Prevention of adenosine-based neuronal activity inhibition on either the
presynapse or postsynapse will recapitulate the effects seen with loss of microglial adenosine generation. Using
these models, we will assess neuronal activation by immediate early gene expression, open field locomotor
activity, and seizure susceptibility. We further demonstrated that expression of key genes involved in microglia
driven neuronal activity modulation are downregulated in aged animals. However, this has yet to be specifically
observed in microglia. Therefore, we proposed to perform gene expression analysis specifically in microglia of
different brain regions and animals of different ages. This information is critical to our understanding of the cellular
mechanisms by which microglia regulate neuronal function and may help to identify key regulators of this
pathway, leading to the development of novel approaches for the treatment of age-associated disorders."
10912017,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The vast majority of adults with Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) in the U.S. now survive hospitalization as a
result of clinical advances. Many ARF survivors experience new and persistent physical, cognitive, and mental
health impairments and >50% of survivors remain dependent on caregiver assistance 1 year after discharge.
Family/caregivers (“care partners”) of ARF patients also experience mental health symptoms and financial
stress, and have difficulty reconciling their expectations with ARF survivors’ recovery. A 2015 systematic
review found persistent symptoms of depression in 23% - 29% of family caregivers of ICU survivors 1 year
after discharge. This is comparable to rates of depression in caregivers for people with dementia and
significantly higher than the prevalence of depression in the U.S. adult population. A 2020 systematic review of
11 RCTs testing interventions to mitigate family emotional distress following critical illness reported that all
trials had failed, suggesting a need for innovative approaches. We posit that expectations within ARF survivor-
care partner dyads influence behaviors and outcomes and are a malleable and innovative target for dyadic
coping interventions (DCI). However, before DCI can be developed, essential research is required to
understand how expectations about recovery are formed following ARF and how they impact the mental health
and coping behaviors of ARF survivor-care partner dyads. We hypothesize that when ARF survivor-care
partner dyads lack confidence in their shared ability to manage new care needs (i.e. low self-efficacy)
expectations for recovery within a dyad influence both mental health and dyadic coping. The overarching
objectives of this application are to learn how expectations about ARF survivorship are related to dyadic mental
health symptoms and dyadic coping (Aims 1 & 2) and to understand how expectations about ARF recovery are
formed and shaped over time within survivor-care partner dyads (Aim 3). To achieve the above objectives, we
propose a mixed methods research program. First, we will conduct a longitudinal cohort study of 235 dyads of
adult ARF survivors and care partners from 4 hospitals (Aims 1 & 2). Thereafter in Aim 3, we will conduct semi-
structured interviews with ≥36 Aim 1 dyads divided across a maximum variation sample of dyads whose
expectations for recovery: a) improved, b) worsened, c) differed substantially between dyad members. We will
also explore how dyads approach dyadic coping and health management to identify gaps that are potentially
modifiable with intervention. The proposed work will provide essential information for developing dyadic coping
interventions specifically tailored to the challenges of ARF survivorship."
10914282,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive
ataxia due to cerebellar degeneration, followed by progressive degeneration and premature death. Substantial
effort has been invested in determining the molecular mechanisms that lead to cerebellar degeneration. This is
largely due to the fact that impairment of these neurons leads to the first symptoms identified in SCA1 patients.
However, loss of cerebellar neurons alone does not account for the muscle weakness and respiratory failure,
which characterize SCA1 progression, and promote premature death. This knowledge gap prompts fundamental
questions about the pathogenic mechanism of premature death. SCA1 is caused by the expansion of CAG
repeats encoding polyglutamines (polyQ) in the ATAXIN1 (ATXN1) protein. The polyQ ATXN1 accumulates in
neurons forming nuclear aggregates ultimately leading to neuronal cell death. Of particular interest to the Orengo
lab is the role motor neurons play in SCA1. These neurons control skeletal muscle activity, and when diseased,
lead to skeletal muscle wasting, weakness, breathing dysfunction, swallowing difficulties and an inability to safely
clear the airway, all of which predispose to respiratory complications leading to premature death. Dr. Orengo
and his team hypothesize that motor neuron dysfunction in SCA1 is the main driver of premature death and that
the mechanisms leading to motor neuron degeneration in SCA1 are different than those involved in cerebellar
neuron degeneration. This distinction may be critical in the development of novel therapeutics that address other
affected cell types than just cerebellar neurons. Using a cadre of SCA1 mouse models, the Orengo lab will be
able to selectively turn on or off the expression of toxic polyQ ATXN1 in motor neurons and assess the molecular
and behavioral changes that follow. Specifically, the goals of this proposal are the following. (1) Assess whether
expression of polyQ ATXN1 in motor neurons is necessary for premature death in a conditional mouse model of
SCA1. (2) Determine the earliest, mid and late transcriptomic changes in motor neurons secondary to
autonomous and non-cell-autonomous polyQ ATXN1 expression. This investigation utilizes an innovative in vivo
approach, with dissociated motor neurons from the spinal cords of mice, sorting their nuclei based on a
fluorescent marker, and then deep sequencing the mRNA molecules present. (3) Explore the role of the master
transcriptional regulator Mdfi in a SCA1 mouse model and ascertain its affect upon the JNK/Jun signaling
cascade. Dr. Orengo’s proposed study is significant because it will shed new light on the role motor neuron
disease plays in SCA1, as well as what pathways are triggered within these neurons that lead to their
degeneration. Understanding these mechanisms will be crucial for developing more effective therapies that
address muscle weakness and premature death in SCA1 patients."
10726588,"Despite their dangers, the number of opioid prescriptions written for veterans has increased sharply since
2000, and veterans are more prone than the general population to both suicide and the development of use
disorders following opioid treatment. Target receptors for opioids are widely expressed throughout the brain
and periphery, but their reinforcing properties are largely mediated by their action in mesocorticolimbic areas
such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In the VTA, activation of
presynaptic mu-opioid receptors is known to blunt release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, thus
“disinhibiting” dopamine neuron activity. Preliminary work has established that the modulatory peptide
neurotensin can activate presynaptic neurotensin 1 receptors (NtsR1) to enhance GABA release in the VTA.
While this novel form of synaptic plasticity would be expected to directly counteract the effects of opioids, it is
not known how repeated opioid exposure interacts with neurotensin effects on GABA signaling. Opioids and
neurotensin are both known to modulate pain; however, there are significant gaps in our knowledge of how
these compounds interact at the synaptic and circuit level in the VTA to affect drug reinforcement. Improved
treatments for opioid use disorders are desperately needed, both for the general population but also for aging
veterans that will increasingly develop painful conditions that require long-term treatment. The proposed
studies are necessary to determine the feasibility of targeting the neurotensin system to modulate
reinforcement and relapse in individuals that no longer can control their opioid intake.
 We will combine brain slice electrophysiology and cell type-specific molecular techniques with self-
administration of the opioid remifentanil in mice to explore these issues. The use of operant self-administration
in mice offers several key advantages: mice are able to titrate their intake based on individual sensitivity, and
using mice instead of rats opens up the powerful tools of mouse genetics (i.e., Cre-lox technology) to
experimental manipulations. The hypothesis to be tested is that a history of remifentanil self-administration
decreases neurotensin-induced enhancement of GABA release in the NAc  VTA circuit, removing a critical
break on dopamine neuron excitability during drug intake to increase reinforcement. Experiments in Aim 1 will
identify the sensitivity of individual GABA inputs in the VTA to neurotensin, and determine how plasticity is
affected by remifentanil self-administration as well as following a forced abstinence. Experiments in Aim 2 will
use chemogenetics to activate specific GABA inputs to determine their effect on remifentanil self-administration
behavior and cue responding following a forced abstinence. A novel cell type-specific neurotensin receptor
knockout will provide additional information on the role of specific cell types on opioid self-administration.
Experiments in Aim 3 will use a discovery approach to determine transcriptomic and epigenomic alterations
following remifentanil self-administration in single cell types of the VTA. This will be done with several novel
NuTRAP (Nuclear Tagging and Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification) mouse lines under the control of Cre
recombinase that allow for labeling and isolation of both DNA and RNA from specific cell types. Improved
strategies are desperately needed to improve the quality of life for veterans at risk of adverse consequences
following opioid treatment. Data obtained will delineate the behavioral and physiological interactions between
GABA input to the VTA, neurotensin signaling, and opioid exposure, and identify novel gene and receptor
targets for exploration as treatments for opioid use disorders."
10726589,"The prevalence of osteoporosis among men is still under-recognized. The patient population of the Veterans
Health Administration (VHA) is predominantly male and many Veterans may be at risk of osteoporosis. Bone
mineral density (BMD) is a highly heritable predictor of osteoporotic fracture. Large-scale genome wide
association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of genetic loci harboring variants (SNPs) robustly associated
with BMD. These loci constitute a treasure trove of untapped information on novel skeletal regulatory genes and
the heritable genomic elements that control their function. However, despite their potential to inform bone biology,
the precise causal variants and target genes have not been definitively identified for even a single locus. Using
a strategy newly developed to map genes implicated by BMD GWAS onto a bone co-expression network, we
predicted causal genes for 30 of 64 GWAS loci. One locus located on chromosome 14q32.32 contained SNPs
highly associated with femoral neck BMD (P=5.0 x 10-16) and we predicted that the Microtubule Affinity-
Regulating Kinase 3 (MARK3), one of five genes in the locus, was causal. MARK3 encodes a conserved
serine/threonine kinase known to regulate diverse processes including asymmetric cell division, and neuronal
differentiation, but its potential role in bone was unknown. Provisional assessment of mice deficient in Mark3
either globally or conditionally (osteoblast) revealed closely similar skeletal phenotypes.
Based on these exciting findings, we developed a comprehensive approach to identify the precise causal
variant(s) linked to MARK3 and determine how the activity of this kinase in osteoblasts controls bone mass. The
studies are divided into two aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the causal genetic mechanism underlying the
Chr14q32.32 BMD GWAS locus. Specific Aim 2: Determine how Mark3 functions in bone. This project was
conceived and will be jointly headed by Thomas Clemens (BLR&D Senior VA Research Career Scientist affiliated
with Johns Hopkins University) and Charles Farber at the University of Virginia under the auspices of a
collaboration arrangement. The synergy of their complimentary research programs has already been established
in previous projects. We strongly believe that the approach will define the biological networks impacted by
mutation will contribute substantially to the understanding of their pathology and provide important targets for
intervention."
10870118,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains highly lethal despite decades of optimizing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-
based combination chemotherapy regimens that are central to treatment. The causes of treatment failure with
5-FU-based regimens include decreased metabolism to FdUMP, the primary active metabolite, and
overexpression of thymidylate synthase (TS), the molecular target of FdUMP. To improve outcomes and
overcome resistance we have developed a nanoscale FP polymer, CF10, that is comprised of FdUMP monomers
linked in a single-stranded DNA backbone that releases FdUMP in a single step. CF10 displays markedly
improved anti-tumor activity with low systemic toxicity relative to 5-FU and is a candidate for clinical translation.
We hypothesize that nanoformulation of CF10 to increase plasma retention and actively target malignant tissue
will improve anti-tumor activity and specificity. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation has proven to be a robust
delivery strategy for multiple nucleic acid drugs, and in collaboration with NanoVation Therapeutics (NTx) in Aim
1 we will test two CF10:LNP formulations designed to differentially target CF10 to liver and more broadly to target
metastatic tissue while protecting CF10 from degradation in plasma. In Aim 2, we will investigate PEGylation of
CF10 together with active targeting to tumor tissue through conjugation with a cyclic RGD peptide that targets
integrin V3 expressed specifically in malignant tissue. We will test our novel nanomaterials for improved anti-
metastatic activity using: (i) a novel genetically engineered mouse model, iKAP, that forms tumors specifically in
the colon with metastatic progression to the liver and lung; and (ii) a rat model of established colorectal liver
metastases (CRLMs). Pharmacokinetic profiling (PK) will be evaluated using LC/MS/MS. In Aim 3, we will
develop a 3rd generation FP polymer that includes 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU), a thymidine analog that is
cytotoxic through complementary mechanisms to FdU. We will use the optimal LNP formulation and PEGylation
strategies determined for CF10 in Aims 1 and 2 to develop a highly novel nanomaterial with exceptional potential
for improved treatment of mCRC."
10931463,"Abstract (Overall). Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs), and it is almost entirely preventable.1,2-4 In 2020, the World Health
Organization (WHO) announced a global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical by the end of this
millennium by vaccinating 90% of girls by aged 15 and screening 70% of women and treating 90% of treatment
eligible women by 2030.5 Based on strong empirical evidence of effectiveness and safety, the WHO recommends
Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-based testing followed by immediate treatment of pre-cancerous lesions, an
approach called screen-and-treat (SAT) for achieving cervical cancer control in LMICs.6 Our investigator team
at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIM) and the University of Cape Town (UCT), through a nearly
thirty-year collaboration under the Khayelitsha Cervical Cancer Screening Program (KCCP), have conducted
seminal clinical trials demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of HPV-based screening and treatment.7-9
Although endorsed in global and national guidelines, the SAT approach has not yet been widely implemented.
Like most LMICs, South Africa is grappling with how to operationalize and promote the widespread and equitable
integration and uptake of HPV screening in healthcare settings. Stakeholders cite a lack of context-specific
implementation, costs, and financing as important implementation barriers. Aligned with RFA-CA-22-019 and in
partnership between the KCCP and the Western Cape Department of Health (WCDoH), we propose the
Empilisweni (isiXhosa for a place of healing) Center for Women’s Health with the overarching mission to
accelerate the integration and scale-up of evidence-based interventions for equitable cervical cancer elimination
among women in resource-constrained settings. Led by MPIs; Denny (UCT), and Kuhn (CUIMC), who founded
KCCSP, will be joined by MPI Castor (Contact: CUIMC), Mbatani (UCT), Saidu (UCT), Shelton (CUIMC),
Tehranifar (CUIMC); and Arendse (UCT/WCDoH) and collaborator Cloete (WCDoH) Informed by implementation
science frameworks and stakeholder engagement approaches, we propose to: Aim 1: Support the WHO’s global
strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer by the end of this millennium by equitably integrating
scalable, affordable HPV-based point-of-care screen-and-treat (POC-SAT) strategies to achieve the secondary
prevention cascade goal of 70% screening and 90% treatment of women who screen positive by 2030 in the
Western Cape Province of South Africa; and Aim 2. Catalyze equitable integration and sustainable scale-up of
POC-SAT by fostering effective collaboration, coordination, capacity-building, and knowledge sharing across
multiple key stakeholders. By the end of the five years, POC SAT will increase the proportion of women who are
screened and treated regionally, will complement centralized HPV testing, and be economically feasible. We will
have a strengthened capacity for leading implementation research in the region and advanced work on strategies
to inform scalable delivery and innovative financing of cervical cancer control for population-level impact."

across the Center’s cores and projects; and 2) Foster effective collaboration, coordination, decision-making,
knowledge and resource sharing across the Western Cape Province informed by best practices on community

10931477,"Project Summary/Abstract - Capacity Building Core
Capacity-building efforts in LMICs are critical to advancing the science of implementation and to have global
impact on cancer inequities. Implementation science capacity strengthening is still in the nascent state for chronic
diseases focused on LMICs, particularly in the context of cancer control efforts. The synergistic research and
cores proposed in the U54 Center are well-poised to address these key gaps and aligned with the priorities of
regional stakeholders. The overarching goal of the Capacity Building Core within the Empilisweni Center for
Women’s Health is to increase implementation research opportunities and capacity in cancer control in the
Western Cape Province of South Africa through didactic and experiential implementation science training and
mentorship for a range of interested researchers, clinicians, and implementation practitioners. The Capacity
Building Core builds off of and extends our team’s nearly three decades of partnership in cutting-edge clinical
research in cervical cancer screening, and existing educational and research capacity and longstanding
partnerships. Aligned with our Center’s theme on advancing equitable and integrated implementation for cancer
control in South Africa, our Specific Aims for building sustainable research capacity to conduct cancer control in
IS include: 1) Deliver a sustainable implementation science training and career development program using the
train-the-trainer model, mentorship, and innovative educational and capacity-building activities, that will enhance
local knowledge of core competencies in the field of implementation science (e.g. foundational theories,
frameworks, strategies, and methods; economic evaluation), supplemented with relevant cancer control and
career development training and opportunities. Leveraging our team’s experience in IS capacity-building and
knowledge dissemination and utilization, this program will be delivered among a range of trainees (researchers,
clinicians, practitioners, community health workers) in South Africa at UCT & MOH, and will build sustainable
implementation research capacity regionally, providing the foundation to equitably scale-up evidence-based
cervical cancer control innovations in the region. 2) In partnership with the Research Projects and Stakeholder
Engagement Core, trainees and stakeholders will help inform and co-lead the development, application,
evaluation, and refinement of implementation science frameworks (e.g. Knowledge to Action, CFIR, RE-AIM),
implementation strategies, and training tools that reflect local context and stakeholder input, with a focus on our
Center’s theme. This Core has the expertise and infrastructure to successfully support and enhance the
professional and career development of investigators and implementers in IS (including 2 lead IS Fellows), with
the ultimate goal of strengthening local capacity and building a sustainable cadre of scholars and practitioners
who are prepared to conduct and lead IS research for cancer control in this region."
10931482,"Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in South Africa where incidence and mortality rates
are expected to rise, in part due to the largest global burden of HIV epidemic in women. Based on strong empirical
evidence, WHO recommends Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-based testing followed by immediate treatment, an
approach called screen-and-treat, as the optimal way to screen for cervical cancer in low- and middle-income
countries (LMCIs) where fragmented care and inadequate infrastructure introduce delays in conventional multi-
step screening process of referral, histological confirmation, and treatment (e.g., cytology-based screening). Our
team’s decades-long international collaborative research has developed the evidence base and the capacity for
implementing HPV-based screening in primary care and generated preliminary implementation data for a Point-
of-Care HPV-based Screen-and-Treat (POC-SAT) approach that enables women to undergo, in a single visit,
HPV testing, evaluation for, and, if indicated, treatment. To promote successful and equitable implementation of
this evidence-based intervention, we propose to develop and assess contextually-informed and scalable
strategies for integrating POC-SAT into public health primary care setting in Khayelitsha, an impoverished
geographic area of predominantly Black residents in the Cape Town metropolitan area. Using stakeholder
participatory processes and drawing on newly revised and LMIC-focused versions of Consolidated Framework
for Implementation Research (CFIR) framework, we will undertake a systematic assessment of multilevel
determinants of POC-SAT implementation within the local primary care context through a) key informant
interviews and b) facility mapping (Aim 1). We will use this assessment to identify, prioritize and refine a package
of tailored strategies for POC-SAT implementation through a) matching stakeholder and facility-level barriers to
a range of implementation strategies listed in the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change
compilation, and b) seeking stakeholder and expert feedback and endorsement for prioritizing and packaging a
set of implementation strategies using a modified Delphi process (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a mixed-
methods evaluation of the POC-SAT implementation to assess the outcomes of a) adoption and reach of POC-
SAT and tailored strategies, and impact on treatment completion (primary outcomes), and b) feasibility,
acceptability and appropriateness among multiple stakeholder groups (secondary outcomes) (Aim 3). The
Project activities synergize closely with the objectives of the Empilisweni Center Cores and Project 2, as well as
with provincial Department of Health efforts to accelerate the integration, implementation and scale-up of
equitable cervical cancer control among women in South Africa. Findings from this project will advance the

Project 2 of the Empilisweni Center for Women’s Health will address the cost and financing of POC-SAT and its
tailored implementation strategies. In Aim 1, using a comprehensive tool from the WHO, we will estimate costs
of cervical cancer screening pre and post implementation of HPV-based POC-SAT in public primary care settings
in Khayelitsha. Outcomes will be cost per woman screened and cost per woman screened and treated. In Aim
2, we will conduct a time-and-motion study to estimate the costs of the scalable, tailored implementation strategy
package to support delivery of POC-SAT in two primary care facilities implementing Aim 3 of Project 1. In Aim
3, we will use a fiscal mapping process to identify, select, and pursue innovative financing strategies for HPV-
based SAT and its implementation in Western Cape. Cost data collection will be conducted in coordination with
the Capacity Building and Stakeholder Engagement Cores to translate knowledge needs and study findings,
where applicable. We will further synergize activities by leveraging the routine Administrative and Engagement
Core stakeholder meetings and External Advisory Panel to brief stakeholders before and after cost data
collection, analysis, and reporting. The findings of this project will be disseminated to local and regional
stakeholders in order to aid decision-making regarding investments in cervical cancer screening and advance
the widespread use of HPV-based SAT in South Africa."
10738258,"Abstract: Repurposing TRM for tumor immunotherapy
Overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and localizing adoptive cell and checkpoint
blockade therapies to solid tumors remain major impediments to successful cancer immunotherapy. This
proposal addresses these issues. Preliminary data indicates that human tumors are populated with antiviral T
cells that remain competent to trigger immunostimulatory sensing and alarm function upon local recognition of
cognate peptide. In mice, peptide alarm therapy synergizes with PD-L1 to clear tumors and mice are durably
protected against tumor growth at alternative anatomic sites in the absence of further treatment. This proposal
will dissect the mechanisms by which peptide alarm therapy triggers tumor clearance and establishes systemic
tumor-specific immunity. It will test synergy with other immunotherapies. Further investigations will be made on
the ability to recapitulate peptide alarm therapy on human tumor explants in anticipation of informing a clinical
trial. This proposal may have a sustained impact on the field by defining a new avenue of cancer immunotherapy
that operates independently but synergizes with other therapies."
10854828,"ABSTRACT
As warm-blooded (endothermic) animals, our survival requires neurons that detect cold temperatures and
initiate adaptive responses. These vital “cold-defense” adaptations allow us to inhabit diverse climates. Cold-
defense responses are a set of motivated behaviors and autonomic changes that help us avoid the cold while
generating and retaining heat. Often, however, these responses are impaired by aging, disease, drugs, or
neurologic injury. Many patients suffer from chronic cold intolerance, and accidental hypothermia remains a
significant public health concern, but our ability to investigate the underlying mechanisms is constrained by an
inability to selectively target central cold-defense neurons. Closing this knowledge gap is the primary objective
of this project. Successful completion of the proposed work will provide information that opens opportunities for
progress in translational research on cold intolerance, as well as thermogenic treatments for obesity and
improved protocols for therapeutic hypothermia. We begin by observing that cold-activated neurons in a
specific region of the brainstem known as the parabrachial nucleus (PB) may represent a vulnerable bottleneck
in this circuit. Neurons in this region collect input from the entire body surface, relayed via neurons at every
level of the spinal cord, and they use this information to activate target sites in the forebrain. Cold-activated PB
neurons are an accessible entry point, but they intermingle with other, diverse populations of PB neurons, and
their molecular identity remains uncertain. We hypothesized that surviving at a cold ambient temperature
requires a specific subset of neurons in this location, which promote cold-defense behaviors and activate
autonomic responses. In our preliminary experiments, eliminating glutamatergic PB neurons did not alter body
temperature or arousal at room temperature. However, cold exposure caused core body temperature to
plummet in these PB-ablated mice, at ambient temperatures that do not cause decompensation in PB-intact
control mice. These preliminary findings suggest that PB neurons are not only involved in, but necessary for
cold-defense responses. In the proposed studies, we will use a rigorous and systematic approach to determine
the identity of PB neurons required for cold defense. We will also determine the behavioral and autonomic
changes produced by activating these neurons. Finally, we will determine which PB-activated behavioral and
autonomic responses are required to sustain core body temperature during prolonged cold exposure.
Successful completion of the proposed expeirments will determine the neurons and neural circuit mechanisms
that allow mammals to survive in the cold. In addition to fundamentally advancing our understanding of this life-
critical neural circuit, this work will improve our understanding of the genetically defined connections and
functions of intermingled neuronal subpopulations in the PB. Our results will have broader impact by opening
opportunities to engineer new methods of inducing and sustaining therapeutic hypothermia for critical care,
field medicine, organ transplant, and someday, perhaps, spaceflight."

insights into the metabolic heterogeneity of obesity and possibly identify novel targets for therapeutic
intervention.
 Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, or exosomes) are produced by cells throughout the body and deliver
bioactive molecules via the bloodstream to regulate metabolic processes in multiple organ systems. Studies in
mice have found that sEVs released from adipose tissue modulate insulin sensitivity and contain regulatory
miRNAs and bioactive lipids that alter insulin signaling. Consistent with these findings, we recently found that
plasma and adipose tissue sEVs obtained from people with obesity and NAFLD impair insulin signaling in
cultured myotubes, suggesting sEVs also contribute to the regulation of insulin sensitivity in people.
 In this proposal, we will evaluate the metabolic effects and cargo content of sEVs isolated from plasma and
adipose tissue (AT) explant cultures obtained from three groups of participants. We will characterize
participants based on adiposity and metabolic health: 1) metabolically healthy lean (MHL, BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2
and normal insulin sensitivity, defined as homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) <2);
2) metabolically healthy obese (MHO, BMI 30.0-44.9 kg/m2 and HOMA-IR<2); and 3) metabolically unhealthy
obesity (MUO, BMI 30.0-44.9 kg/m2 and HOMA-IR>2.5). We posit that: i) sEVs from plasma and adipose
tissue in people who are MUO have adverse effects on insulin action compared with sEVs from people who
are MHL or MHO; ii) these metabolic differences are associated with differences in sEV content of miRNA and
bioactive lipids; and iii) moderate 10% weight loss in people with MUO changes the miRNA and lipid content of
plasma and adipose tissue sEVs and their effects on insulin action.
 The following specific aims will be addressed: 1) determine the effects of sEVs obtained from plasma and
adipose tissue of MHL, MHO and MUO participants on: i) insulin action, gene expression and protein profile in
cells vitro and in mice in vivo; 2) identify differences in miRNA and bioactive lipid profiles of plasma and
adipose tissue sEVs obtained from MHL, MHO and MUO groups; and 3) determine whether a 10% weight
loss-induced increase in insulin sensitivity in the MUO group will alter plasma and adipose tissue sEVs miRNA
and lipid content and ameliorate the adverse effects of plasma and adipose tissue sEVs on insulin action in in
vitro and in mice in vivo. These findings will provide the foundation for future studies in people designed to
assess the potential of sEVs as a therapeutic target to prevent and treat the metabolic complications of
obesity."

PM2.5 is a leading global risk factor for morbidity and mortality and is the leading environmental factor
implicated in cardiovascular disease. Recent data suggest that PM2.5 and/or traffic-related air pollutants may
play a role in chronic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus, that may in turn confer susceptibility to
cardiovascular disease and has been the topic of multiple systematic reviews and meta-analysis by us and
others. In a series of studies in animals and humans, we have provided convincing evidence linking PM2.5 to
pathways playing an etiologic role in cardiometabolic disease. Our findings and reviews have fundamentally
shaped the understanding of the effects of PM2.5 and its association with increased risk of cardiometabolic
disease. In particular, our group has demonstrated pro-atherogenic effects of chronic PM2.5 exposure, through
ROS and inflammation dependent pathways. Although our understanding of pathways contributing to
progression of disease has been dramatically enhanced, the mechanisms involved in the resolution of
inflammation and an understanding of how dysregulation of resolution pathways contributes to disease
progression has been limited. Identification of these mechanisms could pave the way for new opportunities to
target non only air pollution mediated cardiovascular risk but other pervasive health risks. Through the
implementation of three specific aims this proposal seeks to: 1) characterize air pollution-induced changes in
inflammation resolution pathways; 2) determine to what extent these pathways overlap with dietary
manipulation; 3) identify potential intervention strategies to promote upregulation of conserved resolution
pathways in response to air pollution-induced inflammation."

The Mapping Component at Indiana University (MC-IU) will develop and implement at scale a
socio-technical infrastructure that combines human expertise and machine learning algorithms
to construct, visualize, and use the Human Reference Atlas (HRA). It will continue to lead the
construction of ASCT+B tables (expert-curated, connected lists of anatomical structures, cell
types, plus biomarkers based on standard ontologies) and associated reference object libraries
that together define the evolving Human Reference Atlas. We will collaborate closely with the
other mapping component to incorporate cell-by-gene references (e.g., Azimuth) and other
cell-by-biomarker references and 3D reference objects as they become available. We will work
with the HIVE and other teams to link the atlas to experimental data and scholarly paper
evidence. We will work closely with 15 other international consortia to ensure the HRA meets
user needs and supports driving use cases that advance biomedical research and clinical
practice. In close collaboration with the HIVE and tissue data generating teams in HuBMAP and
beyond, we will define and incrementally extend data formats and ontologies for querying,
integrating, and sharing HRA data. We will incorporate modern machine learning and
human-in-the-loop approaches to accelerate the pace at which raw tissue imaging data is
converted into annotated and segmented tissue maps. Advanced spatial management will be
used to keep track of millions of cells derived in tissue data, to support spatial registration of
new tissue, and to enable efficient spatial queries and exploration in the HRA user interfaces.
We will develop a vasculature-based common coordinate system to better capture human
diversity and develop computational models of functional tissue units to link anatomical structure
to function."

Phage therapy, the practice of treating bacterial infections with bacteria-targeting viruses, bacteriophage (or
phage), is a promising and urgently needed alternative to antibiotics. A major challenge holding this approach
back from widespread adoption is that phage treatments need to be customized for the infecting strains in each
patient, a slow and labor-intensive process. This requirement arises from the exquisitely narrow host-range
that many phages display, even among closely related bacterial strains. A major factor driving phage host
range is the immense collection of bacterial anti-phage immune mechanisms that are unevenly distributed
across bacterial strains. However, the underlying molecular arms race between bacteria and phage has given
rise to an equally impressive set of corresponding phage counter-defense pathways, and thus collectively
phage have already evolved mechanisms by which to overcome most bacterial defenses. Similar to their
bacterial counterparts, each phage strain encodes only a miniscule fraction of existing counter-defenses, thus
explaining the narrow host-range of individual phages. Developing a phage treatment that could amass these
naturally occurring phage solutions into a “super phage cocktail” would enable production of an off-the-shelf
phage treatment with a greatly expanded species range and the ability to forestall bacterial resistance.
 Here, I propose developing a pipeline leveraging existing phage counter-defense mechanisms to create a
powerful proof-of-principle phage cocktail for the opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To realize
this vision, I will take an experimental genomic approach to map the immune system of clinically relevant P.
aeruginosa isolates and thereby determine which bacterial defenses the phage will encounter during infections.
I will then develop a powerful, high throughput screen to identify existing phage counter-defense mechanisms
that can overcome these bacterial defenses. Finally, I will create a super phage cocktail encoding an extensive
collection of counter-defense gene cassettes with the ability to infect a broad set of P. aeruginosa strains.
 These studies seek to leverage the existing biology underlying the bacterial-phage molecular arms race to
overcome a major hurdle in the development of phage therapy. This work will provide unprecedented insight
into the breadth and diversity of both bacterial immunity and phage counter-defenses and uncover a multitude
of novel biological mechanisms to be characterized in future studies. The engineered phage cocktail also
constitutes an innovative experimental system that can be used to answer fundamental questions about viral
population diversity and evolution. This initial study will serve as the blue print for development of phage
therapy for other multi-drug resistant opportunistic pathogens."
10894759,"Viruses are inanimate biomolecular assemblages constructed inside host cells for the tasks of
transmission and infection. Despite the high degree of fidelity required to produce functional infectious
particles, viruses are adept at developing resistance to natural and vaccine-induced immune responses
through escape mutations. This is due to the presence of multiple redundant self-assembly signals,
resulting in a fitness landscape with vast regions of favorable sequence space. Viruses can sample
extensively from this space to arrive at escape variants, while retaining the capacity to properly
assemble.
We propose a transformative approach that aims to target large regions of viral fitness
landscapes, with the goal of overcoming antiviral drug resistance. In this approach, various viral
self-assembly signals will be exploited to induce the mis-assembly of viral components toward non-
infectious endpoints. Computationally designed peptides will steer the self-assembly process toward
trapped states accessible to large numbers of genetic variants. Peptides are ideal for this task for a
number of reasons. Firstly, peptides can target large surface areas of proteins, allowing for binding to
targets that lack deep binding pockets. Secondly, peptides can be designed to self-assemble into
diverse supramolecular structures, such as fibers, two-dimensional arrays, and liquid condensates. We
will leverage the ability of peptides to form these types of structures to induce the formation of non-
infectious viral mis-assemblies. Finally, peptides can be optimized for membrane permeability, allowing
for the targeting of viral replication inside host cells.
Drug-induced mis-assembly of HIV viral capsid has been suggested as one of several possible
mechanisms of action of the small-molecule drug PF74. We aim to develop a rationally-guided design
approach to enable the wide-spread application of this novel mechanism of anti-viral action. We will
target three domains of the HIV Gag protein known to play distinct roles in viral assembly for directed
mis-assembly by computationally designed peptides.
The resulting peptides will incorporate design elements that direct the trapping of viral components
within one-dimensional fibers, two-dimensional arrays, and three-dimensional liquid condensates. Self-
assembly will be monitored at the single-molecule level using Interferometric Mass Spectrometry, and
at the bulk level with Bio-layer Interferometry and Dynamic Light Scattering, while Electron Microscopy
and Fluorescence Microscopy will be used to visualize the induced assemblies. This project paves the
way for development of antiviral therapies through mechanisms that pose high barriers to antiviral
resistance."

The identification of the etiologies of frailty and age-related vulnerability remains a crucial challenge for
gerontological research. Key to this challenge are the development of a better understanding of the underlying
biological basis that contributes to frailty and the identification of key biological pathways for the development
of interventions that might help prevent or alleviate frailty and loss of independence. The goal of Johns Hopkins
Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) Biological Mechanisms Core (RC-2) is to enable the next
generation of frailty-related etiological discovery and to promote the translation of these discoveries into
clinically relevant diagnostic, preventive, and treatment modalities. This will be achieved through the provision
of high-quality biological and bioengineering measurement expertise, incorporation of new technologies,
analytical and computational expertise for genetics and omics analyses, and infrastructure necessary to attain
this goal. In order to comprehensively encompass the biological expertise necessary to study frailty-related
etiology, we have engaged a leadership team and internal consultants with complementary and synergistic
biological and translational expertise needed to unravel the complex biological mechanisms that underpin
frailty. They also all bring mentorship skills for trainees, and infrastructure to RC-2 and national prominence to
frailty research. The specific aims of RC-2 are to: 1) provide state of the art scientific expertise, infrastructure,
and technology necessary to advance biological and etiological research related to frailty, 2) provide access to
biological samples from human subjects and from animal models necessary to test hypotheses related to
frailty, 3) facilitate the translation of biological findings into interventions or prevention-focused clinical studies,
4) provide training, mentorship, and guidance to promising junior investigators around biological mechanisms
that impact frailty, and 5) provide institutional and external visibility for RC-2 related science and activities. Our
aims will be accomplished through close communication between the core leaders and their laboratories, close
partnership with the other OAIC cores, and the engagement of expert consultants in the highly relevant areas
of mitochondrial measurement, metabolomics, epigenetics, mouse model development, nanotechnologies for
diagnostic and treatment development, and the development of multi-omic analyses related to frailty. By
providing these resources, RC-2 will foster high quality research that elucidates clinically relevant biological
pathways that underlie frailty and related interventions that hold promise to attenuate frailty, related conditions,
and the loss of independence."

The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) proposes to offer a
resource core entitled Clinical Translation Core, or Resource Core 3 (RC3). This core—now in its 10th year—
was designed to accelerate the translation of important biological findings related to frailty into clinical studies,
and because of the need to train and support junior investigators proposing clinical investigations in frail, older
adults. This initiative is closely aligned with the JHU Division of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology's goals of
integrating frailty-related research into clinical practice. The specific aims of RC3 are 1) to provide supported
OAIC investigators with comprehensive training, mentorship and access to expertise in clinical research, 2) to
provide the oversight necessary to ensure optimal and safe performance of clinical studies, 3) to provide
clinical research space and assistance with all aspects of protocol development, data collection, and
recruitment of human subjects as needed, and 4) to maintain and further develop an active registry of older
adults characterized for frailty and consented to be contacted for additional aging and frailty related studies. A
core leader with substantial clinical research expertise in aging and HIV-related metabolic studies, and who
also leads a core and infrastructure in the JHU Institute of Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR), will
facilitate the development, implementation, and conduct of both clinical physiological studies and clinical trials
in this core. A highly skilled and experienced research program manager with expertise in recruitment of
minoritized older adults and in the measurement of frailty and mobility, along with a team of experienced
recruiters, will facilitate completion of Core aims. These aims will be carried out in close collaboration with the
leaders of all other resource cores. Additional resources are provided by the ICTR, which will help ensure
optimal study design, implementation, and interpretation of results, and Fast Forward, a translationally-focused
unit at JHU will facilitate health technology development. This core will play a crucial role in the training of
junior investigators engaged in Research Education Component (REC) activities and in pilot/exploratory
studies, conduct developmental research as needed and will newly engage community advisory boards to
maximize research relevance and potential to increase health equity. RC3 will continue to accelerate the pace
of translation of the important biological findings being generated in this OAIC into frailty-related clinical studies

novel ecosystem that promotes the development, testing, implementation, and dissemination of novel
technologies and new uses of artificial intelligence for frailty-related purposes. This ecosystem will be created
by bringing engineers, bioengineers, Gerontologists, Geriatricians and other clinical investigators together into
built infrastructure that facilitates the development and testing of novel approaches to health care in frailty. This
core will bridge the existing deep expertise in clinical investigation related to frailty to the deep expertise in

core leaders and congruent with the scientific vision of the OAIC, sets scientific goals for the next stages of
pilot frailty research. They then work to identify investigators whose expertise and career goals would be
applicable to furthering etiological and interventional knowledge in the targeted areas. Pilot and exploratory
studies that can collect data required in order to select or design the future large-scale or confirmatory studies
needed to establish frailty mechanisms, improve measurement and diagnosis, determine etiologies, or develop
novel treatment approaches are prioritized. Studies selected for funding in the first year of this cycle include a
study that uses video-based pose estimation to develop an automated, quantitative frailty and pre-frailty
assessment in older adults, a multimodal approach to finding genetic signatures of frailty in TOPMed
population studies, and a pilot study of provision of digital access to older, frail and underserved patients
awaiting kidney transplant to facilitate improved health care in this most vulnerable group. The specific aims of
the PESC are to 1) solicit, select, and support pilot studies that advance the science and translation of frailty
research, 2) to support the development of well-designed and informative pilot studies, 3) to provide and
conduct longitudinal mentorship to supported investigators as well as provide oversight through completion of
the pilot award and pursuit of funding for the next stage of research, 4) to further guide the translation of any

The long-term objective of the Research Education Component (REC) is the establishment of a cadre of well-
trained, highly motivated junior faculty who will become leaders and mentors in scholarship on frailty and aging
and its translation to maintain independence, health and robustness for older adults. The REC accomplishes
this objective through four specific aims: 1) It provides an education program combining subject-area,
methodological and leadership training together with mentorship having both team-based and one-on-one
elements and a mentored research project, so as to promote, benchmark, and assure research progress and
career development. 2) It partners with the Leadership Council to identify, attract, and select outstanding junior
faculty from a diversity of disciplines with the interest and potential to become future scholarly leaders on frailty
and aging. 3) It provides the research infrastructure, salary support and protected time essential to enable the
selected trainees to successfully bridge the critical transition to independent grant funding. 4) It creates a
welcoming academic home and ‘stimulus zone’ for junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and predoctoral students
invested in frailty-related scholarship through a variety of forums for ongoing networking and intellectual
enrichment where they can interact with each other together and senior OAIC faculty. Forums provided
complement structured mentorship plans for supported faculty and include monthly sessions in which REC-,
PESC- and DP-supported faculty present research-in-progress, twice-monthly meetings of the Frailty and
Multisystem Dysregulation research working group, and sponsorship of other working group meetings,
seminars and guest lectures in collaboration with partnering institutional resources on aging. REC-supported
faculty receive full mentorial and material support from each resource core, as appropriate to their interests
and needs. Information dissemination infrastructure overseen by the LAC provides supported faculty with
avenues by which to disseminate their findings. Resources are prioritized, first, to K-eligible individuals,
followed by R-eligible individuals and then to other trainees so as to direct Core efforts to provide support at a
key transitional point, when research careers are often in jeopardy because of lack of funding and research
infrastructure. The leadership of this Core and the OAIC as a whole will continue to emphasize training across
disciplines and that bridges basic science and clinical investigation. Demographic diversity and inclusion are
prioritized: A new working group will help us ascend yet further in this area. The overall approach we propose
has achieved notable success as evidenced by the accomplishments and success in receipt of career
development awards of previously supported faculty."

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of intrauterine infections in the United States and around the
world. These infections commonly lead to serious adverse pregnancy outcomes including stillbirth, preterm
labor, neonatal sepsis, and systemic maternal disease, which can be life-threatening. One reason that GBS is
such a common etiology of serious intrauterine infection is that—among bacterial vaginal colonizers—it has
exceptional abilities to suppress and evade fetal and maternal innate immune surveillance that is highly
effective at clearing other microbes from the intrauterine cavity. Macrophages are key effectors of maternofetal
innate immunity, and serve important roles in maintaining gestational health, yet can fail to eliminate GBS from
pregnancy tissues, setting the stage for serious complications. The goal of this proposal is to examine, in
detail, molecular interactions between macrophages and GBS cells to discover basic mechanisms of
GBS evasion and suppression of gestational macrophage signaling and bacterial killing. We will use
novel CRISPR/Cas-based bacterial gene suppression techniques to systematically test GBS strains from
knockdown libraries that are deficient in specific, highly conserved, surface trafficked proteins. These strains
with specific externalized protein defects will be coincubated with ex vivo human placental macrophages, both
maternal and fetal-derived, to examine their effects on macrophage cytokine expression, phagocytosis, and
microbial killing. We will use these screens to identify novel GBS surface trafficked proteins with significant
effects on placental macrophage immunophenotypes. Discoveries from these screens, including several
already made in preliminary experiments, will inform generation of targeted gene deletion GBS mutants. These
mutants and appropriate complemented controls will then be used to characterize effects on placental
macrophages in detail, through multiplex cytokine profiling, single-cell transcriptomics, immunofluorescent
confocal microscopy, and examination of in vivo outcomes from a clinically relevant mouse model of GBS
intrauterine infection. Our two proposed aims will use innovative, multimodal approaches to identify GBS
externalized protein targets for new vaccines or therapeutics for prevention and early treatment of dangerous
intrauterine infections."

The role of lactate in energy metabolism has been of considerable biochemical and physiologic interest. Beyond
its classical description as glycolytic end-product, lactate’s more recent emerging roles include inter-organ
metabolic fuel, receptor ligand, and protein post-translational modification. Given that some of these roles have
only been identified, or further expanded upon, in the past few years suggests that we are still in the early stages
of understanding the diversity of lactate functions in energy homeostasis. We have recently reported that lactate
metabolism into a downstream metabolite, Lac-Phe, generates a blood-borne signaling molecule that mediates
tissue crosstalk and suppresses feeding and obesity (Li et al., Nature 2022). Ablation of Lac-Phe biosynthesis
in mice increases food intake and obesity after exercise, demonstrating the physiologic relevance of this
pathway. Our data uncover an unexpected and underappreciated aspect of lactate – as a precursor for a
circulating lactate-derived signaling metabolite – in energy homeostasis. Because of this fundamentally new
insight, here in this proposal we focus entirely on additional biochemical and physiologic studies of Lac-Phe and
this downstream pathway of lactate metabolism. Building on a large body of published preliminary data, as well
as unpublished studies in cells and in mice, this proposal will test the central hypothesis that Lac-Phe is a tightly
regulated, lactate-derived signaling metabolite that engages specific cell surface molecules to regulate energy
balance. In Aim 1, we will determine the specific cell populations that produce Lac-Phe in vivo and their
contribution to whole-body energy balance. This Aim is enabled by our newly generated conditional, Cndp2
floxed allele which allows for cell type-specific ablation of Lac-Phe biosynthesis. In Aim 2, we will determine the
role of a kidney solute carrier in the downstream metabolism of Lac-Phe. Preliminary studies demonstrate this
solute carrier exhibits robust Lac-Phe transport activity in cells. Finally in Aim 3, we will determine the structural
features and downstream molecular targets that mediate Lac-Phe’s effects on food intake. We have identified
candidate cell surface molecules that are engaged by Lac-Phe. Successful completion of this proposal will
provide a detailed and molecular understanding of Lac-Phe biochemistry and physiology, thereby establishing a
scientific foundation for developing new therapeutics that target the Lac-Phe pathway for obesity, type 2
diabetes, and metabolic diseases."

 The objective of our research is to access new chemical spaces in drug discovery and development by
reimagining the catalytic conditions for electricity-driven organic transformations. We propose a synthetic
platform to couple every major class of C(sp3) organic halide electrophile with aldehyde and ketones. By fine-
tuning the key electrophile interactions with the electrode material by interfacial design, we propose to forge
C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds with high selectivity and stereoselectivity. Our approach will provide direct and catalytic
access to new chiral alcohol and α,α-difluorobenzylic derivatives, prevalent motifs in several high-profile
pharmaceuticals, from accessible feedstocks. Our synthetic methods will provide complementary and direct
approaches to access (enantio)selective C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds that are restricted to non-catalytic or multi-step
reactions. Non-catalytic reactions require either the generation of highly reactive reaction intermediates that
degrade bioactive functional groups or the use of expensive and rare elements that limit wide-spread adoption.
In addition to increasing the accessibility to prepare and diversify pharmaceuticals via electrocatalytic C(sp3)–
C(sp3) bond formation, our mechanistic and structural analyses of electrified interfaces will dissect the
fundamental properties that control interfacial reactivity in complex electrosynthetic manifolds. Thus, our program
will reveal how new mechanisms to construct C(sp3)–C(sp3) can be accessed by engaging a recoverable and
infinitely reusable solid electrocatalyst interface; an inherently sustainable synthetic approach that can be readily
adoptable by medicinal chemists."

Although consistent physical activity is routinely prescribed to control hyperglycemia associated
with type 1 diabetes (T1D), individual bouts of physical activity may increase the likelihood of
evoking dangerous cardiovascular responses (i.e., heart attack and/or stroke). The long-term goal
of this project is to elucidate mechanisms of autonomic dysfunction of cardiovascular control dur-
ing physical activity to improve health and reduce mortality in those with T1D. The overall objec-
tive is to determine the roles of P2X3Rs and ASIC3 on the exaggerated BP response to physical
activity in males and females who are differentially afflicted by T1D and cardiovascular disease.
The central hypothesis is that the effects of both P2X3Rs and ASIC3 on thin fiber muscle afferents
contribute to the exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in T1D rats, an effect that changes with the
pathophysiology of the disease. The rationale for this project is that understanding mechanisms
of autonomic dysfunction of cardiovascular control, which present in response to physical activity,
will lead to treating the temporal pathophysiology of T1D, thereby ameliorating risk of adverse
cardiovascular events. The central hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Determine
the effects of metabolically sensitive P2X3Rs and ASIC3 on the altered exercise pressor reflex in
T1D rats at different phases of the disease; 2) Determine the effects of metabolically sensitive
P2X3Rs and ASIC3 on group III and IV afferent activity in T1D rats at different phases of the
disease; 3) Determine the expression patterns of P2X3Rs and ASIC3 in the DRG neurons of T1D
rats at different phases of the disease. For Aim 1, cardiovascular responses to muscle contraction
will be measured in T1D rats before and after blocking or stimulating ASIC3 and P2X3Rs. For
Aim 2, group III and IV afferent activity during muscle contraction will be measured in T1D rats
before and after blocking or stimulating ASIC3 and P2X3Rs. For Aim 3, the location and expres-
sion of ASIC3 and P2X3Rs on hindlimb DRG neurons will be determined using various biochem-
ical techniques. The research proposed in this application is innovative because this will be the
first study to determine the changing interactive effects of receptors and channels evoking reflex-
ive blood pressure responses during exercise in both male and female T1D rats. Additionally, this
study will be the first to analyze sex differences in blood pressure responses to exercise in T1D.
The proposed research is significant because it will provide an initial understanding of possible
mechanisms responsible for evoking the exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in T1D."
10881928,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that constitutes
the leading cause of neurologic disability in young adults. Astrocytes, microglia and monocytes play important
roles in MS and its model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), but the mechanisms that regulate
their activity are poorly understood. The study of astrocyte and microglia regulation may identify mechanisms of
pathogenesis and therapeutic targets in MS, particularly for the progressive phase of the disease.
 Our long-term goal is to develop therapies to limit astrocyte pathogenic activities in MS. During the course
of our studies we made the following preliminary observations: 1) SigmaR1-IRE1a signaling activates the
transcription factor XBP1 in astrocytes, promoting microglial activation, monocyte recruitment to the CNS and
disease pathology during EAE; 2) Astrocyte-specific XBP1 knockdown ameliorates EAE; 3) XBP1 is activated in
an astrocyte subset in EAE and MS; 4) XBP1 activation in astrocytes is associated to increased VEGF-B
signaling 5) Microglia and CNS-recruited monocytes produce VEGF-B during EAE; and 6) VEGF-B produced by
microglia boost astrocyte pro-inflammatory activities. We hypothesize that active XBP1 (XBP1s) drives a
pathogenic astrocyte subset (XBP1s+ astrocytes) in MS and EAE, which is controlled by microglia- and
monocyte-produced VEGF-B. Thus, we propose to study the role of SigmaR1-IRE1a-XBP1 signaling in
astrocytes in EAE and MS, and its potential as a therapeutic target. Our specific aims are:
SPECIFIC AIM 1: Does XBP1 activation define a subset of pathogenic astrocytes?
We propose to: 1) Characterize XBP1s+ astrocytes in EAE using Focused Interrogation of cells by Nucleic acid
Detection and Sequencing (FIND-seq) a method, which we developed to study cell subsets in-depth, and 2)
Generate a spatiotemporal map of the localization, regulation and cell interactions of XBP1s+ astrocytes and
other cell subsets in EAE and MS using MERFISH (Multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization).
SPECIFIC AIM 2: How do microglia and monocytes control XBP1s+ astrocytes?
We propose to: 1) Define the role of VEGF-B produced by microglia and monocytes on the control of XBP1s+
and other astrocyte subsets during EAE, and 2) Identify by NICHE-seq additional pathways involved in the control
of XBP1s+ and other astrocyte subsets by microglia and monocytes during EAE.
SPECIFIC AIM 3: Is SigmaR1 a therapeutic target to modulate CNS inflammation?
We propose to: 1) Evaluate the therapeutic value of the clinical-grade CNS penetrant SigmaR1 antagonist S1RA
on EAE, and 2) Define the effects of S1RA on XBP1s+ astrocytes, and other cell subsets in the CNS in EAE.
 IN SUMMARY, this project studies a novel astrocyte subset, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that
control it, its distribution and cell interactions throughout the CNS, and its potential as a therapeutic target in MS."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated, demyelinating, and degenerative disease of the central
nervous system and is a leading cause of disability in young people. Most patients begin with a relapsing-
remitting (RRMS) course. Clinical relapse and new white matter lesion formation is dramatically reduced by
current therapies. However, despite evidently efficacious treatment of RRMS, many patients eventually
develop progressive MS (PMS) wherein disability accumulates refractory to treatment. Progressive disability is
driven by neurodegeneration which begins early in the disease, occurs independent of relapses, and is poorly
understood. Two potential contributors to neurodegeneration are subclinical inflammation and metabolic stress.
Clinical relapses and new lesion formation are driven by inflammatory demyelination, but additional
inflammation is present outside of discrete lesions. This inflammation is associated with chronic demyelination
and increased metabolic demand. Both inflammation and metabolic stress may lead to neurodegeneration,
either alone or in combination.
This study will use a novel positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent, 11C-CS1P1, which binds to
sphingosine-1-phosphate-receptor 1 (S1PR1) as a marker of inflammation. S1PR1 signaling is critical to MS as
evidenced by four FDA approved S1P-modulators with high efficacy for reducing relapses in RRMS.
Additionally, we will use metabolic imaging with 18F-FDG PET and advanced, oxygen-sensitive magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) to measure cerebral glucose and oxygen utilization, respectively. These
measurements will be made in a cohort of heathy control participants, RRMS patients who will be initiating an
S1P-modulating drug and RRMS patients initiating a similarly efficacious non-S1P-modulating drug (B-cell
depleting therapies). Patients will be imaged prior to and 3-months following initiation of treatment. These data
will allow for testing the hypotheses that subclinical inflammation and metabolic stress are present in RRMS
and are incompletely mitigated by current treatments. This study will address three Specific Aims. The first aim
tests the hypothesis that inflammation is increased outside of MS lesions in seemingly normal appearing tissue
and is reduced by S1P-modulation. The second aim will examine the metabolic needs and stress of normal
appearing white matter and gray matter in MS patients compared to controls. The first two aims will compare
their respective biomarkers pre- vs. post-initiation of an S1P-modualting drug. The final aim investigates how
S1PR1 expression and metabolic stress are modulated by an efficacious, but not S1P-modualting therapy.
Completion of this study will provide new understanding of processes that drive neurodegeneration in
MS and contribute to clinical morbidity and disability."

As an organism that persists in its natural hosts for long periods of time, Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative
agent of Lyme disease, has adapted many strategies for survival and evasion of host immune responses. It
has a very small genome and is unable to produce many essential nutrients for itself and is instead, dependent
upon utilizing them from its environment. We have recently shown that B. burgdorferi is able to acquire host
phospholipids and deploy them, intact, in its membrane. A cost of utilizing host phospholipids is that it may
result in production, or de-repression of autoantibodies to host phospholipid targets. Indeed, in our preliminary
studies, we found that mice and humans infected with B. burgdorferi produce antibodies to host phospholipids
that the organism itself does not produce. Antibodies to phospholipids arise quicker than other antibodies to B.
burgdorferi and also appear to resolve more quickly, as might be expected since autoantibody production is
typically tightly regulated. However, in patients with PTLDS as compared with patients who resolve their
symptoms after treatment for Lyme, there appears to be increased levels of anti-phospholipid antibodies. It is
unknown whether these antibodies may be pathogenic or are just a marker for PTLDS.
In this proposal, we will explore the development of anti-lipid/phospholipid antibodies during Lyme disease and
their potential role in PTLDS. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent of anti-lipid/phospholipid development at
different stages of disease and determine their relationship to disease resolution/persistent symptoms in
patients with Lyme disease. In Aim 2, we will examine binding of these antibodies to human cells and tissues
and look for the presence of immune complexes which are often deposited in auto-immune diseases. Finally,
in Aim 3, we will explore a new animal model for PTLDS. A recent study has shown that injection of antibodies
from patients with fibromyalgia, a disease with marked similarities to PTLDS in symptoms, into mice results in
hypersensitivity to pain and cold as well as changes in locomotion. Histological studies have shown binding of
the human antibodies to neural tissues and macrophages. We will test a similar model using serum from
patients with PTLDS, recovered Lyme disease and fibromyalgia. In our preliminary studies, we have found
increased binding of antibodies from PTLDS patients to mouse brain tissue compared with binding from
healthy control antibodies. The discovery of autoantibodies to lipids/phospholipids opens a new area for
discovery in the pathogenesis for Lyme disease and may lead to better diagnostic tests and a new
understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease."

Carrie E. Fry PhD, MEd is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Health Policy in the Vanderbilt School of
Medicine. She is a health services and policy researcher whose portfolio is focused on improving health and
social outcomes for Americans with a substance use disorder (SUD) or mental illness through rigorous
observational and quasi-experimental methods. This training grant will support Dr. Fry’s career goal of becoming
an independent researcher with expertise in evaluation strategies to inform policy affecting marginalized
Americans. This type of expertise is in high demand: the incidence and prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD)
has significantly increased since the mid-2010s with related harms, including emergency room visits and fatal
overdoses, increasing at a similar pace. Access to evidence-based OUD treatments, especially among Medicaid
enrollees, has not increased at the same rate. For these reasons, understanding the Medicaid policy levers to
increase access to treatment is crucial to combatting the broader SUD crises in the US. One way state Medicaid
programs have responded is by expanding the continuum of care to include residential treatment. Historically,
Medicaid programs not been allowed to provide residential SUD treatment for most adults. Following guidance
issued in 2015, states could apply for time-limited, demonstration waivers to expand coverage for residential
treatment to adults between 21-64 years old. Since then, 32 states have received approval for and implemented
a Section 1115 waiver to provide residential SUD treatment. States have flexibility regarding the specific
provisions of these waivers potentially leading to mixed outcomes, and the impact of expanded residential
treatment coverage in Medicaid is largely unknown. The research proposed in this K01 will address these gaps
to inform future policy. Aim 1 will survey Medicaid officials in the 13 states participating in the Medicaid Distributed
Research Network (MODRN) to identify variation in Medicaid residential treatment coverage. Then, I will conduct
semi-structured interviews with Medicaid and other state officials from six MODRN states to further explore these
differences. Aim 2 will use Medicaid claims data from three states to produce reliable and generalizable evidence
on the effect of expanded coverage for residential treatment on beneficiary-level health and utilization outcomes.
Details gleaned from these survey and interviews will be used to appropriately contextualize Aim 2’s results; the
evaluation proposed in Aim 2 can be completed regardless of these findings. Finally, Aim 3 will produce the first
generalizable estimates of co-morbid SUD among Medicaid enrollees with OUD, a subpopulation more likely to
access residential treatment. Results from these aims will provide extensive preliminary data for an R01
evaluating these coverage expansions among sub-populations identified in Aim 3 and inform future Medicaid
policy around residential treatment. With the assistance of her mentors, Dr. Fry has identified training objectives
in addiction medicine, state health policy, and measurement issues in administrative claims data that will further
her progress toward becoming a leading, independent researcher in the field of SUD and Medicaid policy."

In response to large numbers of senior center clients who suffer untreated depression and the dearth of
geriatric mental health providers, we have partnered with senior center stakeholders to simplify Behavioral
Activation (BA) to match the skill set of lay volunteers (“Do More, Feel Better”; DMFB).
The lay delivery model: 1. makes use of existing volunteer resources that can address the insufficient
workforce; and 2. has potential for being an acceptable and sustainable delivery model. However, the capacity
of this model to engage the same target (increased activity) and to yield comparable clinical outcomes as
professionally-delivered interventions is yet to be determined in a fully-powered trial.
This Collaborative R01 proposes fully powered randomized effectiveness trial testing the effect of DMFB in
comparison to professionally-delivered BA (MSW BA) on increased activity level (target) and decreased
depressive symptoms.
The specific aims are to: 1. Test the effectiveness of DMFB, in comparison to MSW BA, for depressed (PHQ-
9>10 and Ham-D>14) older adults (>60) on increasing overall activity level (target) and reducing depression
symptoms; and 2. test whether increased activity level predicts greater reduction in depression severity and
whether increased activity's impact on depression is non-inferior across conditions.
Client participants will be a total of 288 older (>60 years) non-psychotic, non-demented individuals with elevated
depressive symptoms from 6 Seattle, 6 New York City, and 6 Tampa area senior centers serving economically
and ethnically diverse communities. Eligible clients will be randomized within senior center to either DMFB
(n=144) or MSW BA (n=144). Two lay volunteers and 2 MSWs per center will provide the intervention.
Our proposal responds to the 2012 IOM report which highlighted the dearth of mental health providers for older
adults and the need to develop a workforce of nontraditional providers. DMFB is a streamlined BA intervention
that has high potential for sustainability by making use of an untapped volunteer resource and supervision
infrastructure within senior centers. Our findings will identify effective interventions for an underserved and
difficult to engage population, our partners in aging services would be pleased to implement either delivery
format of BA to activate depressed older adults."
10739321,"Few effective therapies are available for KRAS-mutant lung cancer
(KMLC). To address this problem, we seek to elucidate the biological basis for KMLC growth and metastasis
and to develop novel therapies on the basis of that improved understanding. Cancer cells secrete factors that
promote tumor growth, matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and inflammation, a process hereafter termed
“malignant secretion”. Therapeutic strategies to block malignant secretion have not been developed.
 We have identified a chromosome 1q amplicon harboring and numerous regulators of vesicle biogenesis
and trafficking, including phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KIIIβ), a Golgi-dedicated kinase that generates
phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). We show that the viability and proliferative and invasive activities of
1q–amplified KMLC cells require PI4KIIIβ. A selective PI4KIIIβ antagonist preferentially induced apoptosis and
inhibited the metastatic properties of 1q–amplified KMLC cells. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesize
that high PI4KIIIβ levels promote KMLC growth and metastasis and confer vulnerability to PI4KIIIβ antagonists.
To test this hypothesis, we propose in Aim 1 to an autochthonous PI4KIIIβ–expressing KMLC model and
determine whether PI4KIIIβ enhances KMLC metastatic propensity and confers vulnerability to PI4KIIIβ
antagonists. Our findings will elucidate the way in which PI4KIIIβ drives KMLC progression and may provide a
foundation for new therapeutic approaches using PI4KIIIβ antagonists.
 We show that high PI4KIIIβ levels in 1q–amplified KMLC cells enhanced anterograde vesicular trafficking
and stimulated the secretion of pro-survival and pro-metastatic factors. PI4KIIIβ–driven metastatic properties
required Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3), a PI4P–tethered Golgi protein that promotes vesicle budding from
the trans-Golgi network. Therefore, we postulate that PI4KIIIβ-dependent secretion is required to activate pro-
metastatic processes in the tumor microenvironment and maintain the viability of 1q-amplified KMLC cells. To
test this hypothesis, we will inactivate Golph3 in PI4KIIIβ-expressing autochthonous KMLCs and 1q-amplified
orthotopic KMLCs. Resultant changes in tumor cell viability and inflammatory, stromal, and vascular cell
functions in the tumor microenvironment will be measured. We will identify PI4KIIIβ-dependent secreted
proteins that mediate these changes and elucidate how they exert these functions. Our findings will provide
insight into how a secretory process activated by a chromosomal region that is frequently amplified in cancer
maintains tumor cell viability and influences diverse processes in the tumor microenvironment.
 In summary, the evidence presented here links malignant secretion to a chromosomal region that is
frequently amplified in KMLC and provides a basis for clinical studies to develop PI4KIIIβ antagonists as first-
in-class inhibitors of malignant secretion. Our findings elucidate the molecular underpinnings of malignant
secretion and show that chromosome 1q-amplified cancers are vulnerable to secretory blockade."
10739324,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goals of this application are to develop novel targeted therapies for clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue
(CCSST) and understand their mechanism of action. CCSST is a rare and aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that
typically develops in the lower extremity close to tendons and aponeuroses of adolescents and young adults. It
is an orphan disease presently with no cure. The 5-year survival rate is only 20% for metastatic cases. The
current treatment option is to perform wide local surgical resection or amputation attempting to remove all the
cancer cells. However, in metastatic cases, complete removal of cancer cells becomes impossible and
systemic adjuvant therapy is the key to control this disease. Unfortunately, this disease is notorious for its
insensitivity to existing chemotherapies, underscoring an urgent need for developing novel targeted therapies
for CCSST. The hallmark of CCSST is characterized by a balanced t(12;22) (q13;q12) chromosomal
translocation, which results in a fusion of the Ewing's sarcoma gene EWSR1 (EWS RNA-bind protein 1) with
activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) to generate an oncogene EWS-ATF1. ATF1 is a member of the cAMP-
responsive element binding protein (CREB) family transcription factor. EWS-ATF1 is constitutively active to
drive the expression of target genes that are normally regulated by CREB/ATF1. In addition to ATF1, EWS-
CREB fusion has also been detected in CCSST patients, further supporting a critical role of CREB/ATF1's
transcription activity in driving the development of CCSST. In vitro and in vivo studies in various CCSST
models have convincingly shown that CCSST cells depend on the EWS-ATF1-mediated gene transcription
activity for continued survival. These results suggest that targeting EWS-ATF1 is a powerful and promising
approach to develop novel targeted therapeutics for CCSST. As a transcription factor, EWS-ATF1 has been a
challenging target for developing small molecule inhibitors. In addition, the mechanisms by which EWS-ATF1
activates gene transcription are not well-understood. We recently developed a small molecule called 666-15 as
the first potent inhibitor of CREB/ATF1-mediated gene transcription. 666-15 is well-tolerated in vivo. In this
application, we will investigate the activity of 666-15 in various CCSST models and its mechanism of action
(Aim 1). We will further study how EWS-ATF1 activates gene transcription (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will identify
combination treatment strategies for CCSST."
10739325,"Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common disabling condition in the elderly, particularly in those with impaired
autonomic reflexes. Supine hypertension is the most common comorbidity; it not only increases the risk for target
organ damage but also induces pressure natriuresis during nighttime causing nocturia and volume depletion that
contributes to OH. Thus, nocturnal hypertension worsens daytime OH. Unfortunately, there is reluctance to
treat supine hypertension for fear of worsening OH. Sleeping in a head-up tilt (HUT) position can improve
nocturnal hypertension by reducing venous return, stroke volume and cardiac output, but tilt levels needed to
produce these effects are difficult to achieve clinically. In this application, we propose that increasing intrathoracic
pressure with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), at levels used clinically, will produce similar
hemodynamic effects as HUT, by inducing venous pooling into the splanchnic circulation. Indeed, our preliminary
studies show that CPAP, at levels used clinically, induces an acute and reversible decrease in blood pressure
in autonomic failure patients without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by a direct hemodynamic mechanism, and
this effect is sustained during the night and associated with decreased nocturia. In normal subjects this effect is
masked by compensatory sympathetic activation. The overall goal of this application is to test the hypothesis
that increasing intrathoracic pressure with CPAP is an effective treatment for nocturnal hypertension in patients
with autonomic failure and that, by reducing pressure diuresis, it will improve daytime OH. In Specific Aim 1,
we will characterize the hemodynamic mechanisms of CPAP in autonomic failure patients, determine its effects
on volume shifts from the thoracic to abdominal segments, on hormones that regulate natriuresis, and on central
blood pressure and indices of arterial stiffness. These indices are better predictors of negative cardiovascular
outcomes than brachial blood pressure, and this unique patient population will allow us to determine the effects
of CPAP unencumbered by sympathetic modulation. We also propose overnight proof-of-concept studies to test
the hypotheses that CPAP is effective in controlling nocturnal supine hypertension (Specific Aim 2) and reduces
nighttime diuresis, resulting in improvement of daytime orthostatic tolerance (Specific Aim 3). For these initial
proof-of-concept mechanistic studies we exclude patients with OSA because our focus is on the novel
hemodynamic effects of CPAP rather than suppression of apneic episodes. We believe the proposed studies
will lead to a clinically significant and innovative approach for the management of nocturnal hypertension in
patients with autonomic failure, changing the way we manage patients, and eliminating the controversy of
whether to treat, or not to treat, supine hypertension. If successful, lowering nighttime blood pressure will reduce
nocturia, which not only impairs sleep but also exposes patients to falls. More importantly, it will improve daytime
orthostatic tolerance and improve the quality of life of our patients. Our studies will also improve our basic
knowledge about the effects of CPAP on cardiovascular regulation, that can then be applied to other conditions."

Heart failure morbidity and mortality disproportionately impact racial minorities, and inequitable care delivery
based on race is pervasive in the United States. While the American Indian/Alaska Native population is one of
the populations that suffers most from health disparities, little is known about their burden of cardiovascular
disease, particularly heart failure. In fact, there are no studies in the current era evaluating the burden and
outcomes of heart failure among the American Indian/Alaska Native population, or the quality of care they
receive. The proposed mixed-methods research plan aims to characterize the burden of disease, outcomes,
and quality of care of American Indian/Alaska Native patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
receiving care through the Indian Health Service— the principal health care provider for the American
Indian/Alaska Native population, as well as to determine implementation strategies to ensure quality heart
failure care for this population. Aim 1 seeks to characterize the clinical characteristics, as well as rates of
guideline directed medical and device therapy and outcomes of American Indian/Alaska Native patients with
heart failure receiving care through the Indian Health Service. This aim will utilize a large administrative clinical
and claims database. Aim 2 will augment this analyses by employing qualitative research methods to interview
American Indian heart failure patients discharged after a heart failure hospitalization, as well as primary
providers at two Indian Health Service sites in Navajo Nation to better understand barriers to quality heart
failure care. Aim 3 will employ an implementation mapping approach with a stakeholder taskforce at the same
sites to determine the highest priority strategies to improve heart failure care for this population. These aims
will lead to a future pilot pragmatic clinical trial of American Indians with heart failure in Navajo Nation, which
will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the highest priority strategies to improve care identified in aim 3.
These research aims are part of a comprehensive training plan and will be supervised by a mentorship and
advisory team consisting of national leaders in health services and implementation science research, and
advanced statistical and qualitative methodologies, and will guide my transition to an independently funded
research career."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most serious medical diseases facing our society, and
understanding the events leading to T2D, specifically the genesis of obesity and insulin
resistance, key components of T2D, is critical. Fiber, which is known to be protective against
T2D, is fermented by gut bacteria, resulting in the synthesis of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs),
predominantly acetate, propionate, and butyrate. This is one of the key proposed mechanisms
that the gut microbiome protects against these metabolic conditions. Importantly, free fatty acid
receptors 2 (FFA2) and -3 (FFA3), which sense and mediate the action of SCFAs, have altered
expression in obesity and insulin resistant states. These receptors are expressed in β cells and
in enteroendocrine (L) cells, where they are suggested to contribute to the secretion of glucagon-
like peptide-1 (GLP-1) regulating β cell function, which collectively contribute to the secretion of
insulin. These receptors, therefore, are primed to mediate the interaction between bacterial
fermentation to SCFAs and hormonal secretion. We propose to use novel genetic knockout (KO)
murine models to dissect how fiber (via SCFA production) mediates metabolic outcomes such as
obesity and insulin resistance where we will explore at the whole body (global, Aim 1) and tissue-
specific level (Aim 2), focused on the enteroinsular axis, and assess the translational component
of these receptors to human tissues (Aim 3). Overall, this study will reveal that a novel SCFA-
sensing mechanism influences host metabolic response to obesogenic challenge."

 The sodium-dependent NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) is the main ion transporter in
hundreds of pathogenic bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae, the causal agent of cholera, a devastating
gastrointestinal disease with a worldwide distribution that has developed multidrug-resistant phenotypes. Na+-
NQR fulfills two essential roles in V. cholerae cell physiology, as a respiratory enzyme, providing energy to the
cell, and as the main sodium pump, energizing the membrane and driving nutrient uptake, pH regulation,
elimination of drugs, cell motility, secretion of toxins and other homeostatic processes. Na+-NQR is an optimal
drug target due to its critical role in bacterial metabolism and because it is absent in mammalian cells. Moreover,
Na+-NQR has unique structural motifs, not found in any human protein, which allow the discovery of drugs that
can act specifically on this enzyme. In addition, Na+-NQR inhibitors could increase the susceptibility of V.
cholerae to other drugs by de-energizing the membrane, and may be used in a combination dosing approach to
rescue obsolete antibiotics. Our group has now identified two novel compound leads, ubiquinone analogs
(UQAs) and phenothiazines, as inhibitors of this enzyme that are suitable for drug development. The three UQAs
analogs characterized have antimalarial properties and show specific and potent inhibitory effects on Na+-NQR,
with strong antibiotic activity against V. cholerae. These compounds not only abolish V. cholerae Na+-NQR
enzymatic activity, but also trigger the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which is lethal to microbes.
The structures of these inhibitors and docking methods were used to identify the pharmacophore and the binding
modes of the molecules in the UQ binding site, which allow us to pursue lead development to obtain inhibitors
of high potency and specificity. In addition, we have identified three phenothiazine-like compounds with anti-
psychotic properties that show potent inhibitory activity against Na+-NQR and that could be optimized into
antibiotics. The main aim of this project is the development of a novel class of antibiotics to specifically target
the Na+-NQR complex. The inhibitors that we have identified will be fully characterized, to understand their
mechanism of action, binding sites, potency and antibiotic properties. Moreover, toxicity towards human cells
and mitochondria, as well as their pharmacologic properties, will be assessed to evaluate the potential of these
compounds to treat human infections. The data obtained from toxicity studies, enzymatic and microbiological
characterizations will be used to guide the design and synthesis of analogs with high potency and low toxicity.
Lead optimization will be carried out by our medicinal chemistry team guided by pharmacophore analysis,
docking and binding free energy calculations. The structures of the newly-identified inhibitors will be used to build
compound libraries carrying the active core with different substitution patterns, which will be iteratively screened
and characterized. The data generated in this proposal is critical to the discovery of urgently-needed antibiotics
with a new mechanism of action effective against V. cholerae and many other Na+-NQR bearing pathogens."
10737631,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Within the same community, TB risks can differ by several orders of magnitude due to differences in
infectious exposure and immune competence, and TB control depends heavily on targeting services to
those most at risk. Priority groups described by the CDC and other agencies capture major TB risk
factors, but these broad categories include many individuals with low TB risk, and exclude others who
would benefit from screening. Our long-term objective is to provide individually- and locally-tailored
evidence on TB risks and intervention effects, to optimize TB prevention services. In prior work we have
demonstrated the feasibility of estimating TB risks for small population groups, and in Aim 1 we will
create granular estimates of TB risk for the US population, via a Bayesian evidence synthesis combining
time series data on TB cases and population size, prevalence of latent infection (LTBI), and the fraction
of cases due to recent infection. This analysis will allow us to produce individually-tailored risk predictions
to better target preventive services, and provide patients with quantitative information on the risks they
face. The number of patients to whom this applies is substantial—approximately half of all US residents
have been tested for LTBI, and of those testing positive only half initiate treatment. This represents a
large number of people facing decisions about LTBI testing and treatment. Aim 2 will directly address
these questions, creating highly-disaggregated estimates of the costs, harms, and benefits of LTBI
testing and treatment. To do so we will construct a Markov microsimulation model of LTBI screening and
treatment. Using this model we will estimate long-term patient-level outcomes, including changes in TB
risk, survival, costs, and adverse events. Based on these analyses we will develop a user-friendly web
tool to provide patients and clinicians prompt, validated, and individually-tailored information on possible
treatment outcomes. We will also conduct analyses and develop a companion tool that will report the
impact and cost-effectiveness of LTBI screening for user-defined target groups for the purpose of guiding
program decision-making. To increase the reach and impact of these tools we will adapt them for other
countries with TB incidence below 20 per 100,000. In Aim 3 we will develop a transmission-dynamic
simulation model to predict long-term outcomes for a broad set of TB control options (including but not
limited to LTBI treatment) and risk factor trends. The model will be calibrated for multiple jurisdictions,
and a web-based interface will allow users to specify scenarios and visualize outcomes. By identifying
how current and novel interventions can be most effectively deployed to improve health, this research
addresses the NIH’s highest priority area of health economics research, and responds directly to the
need for computational tools and models to better understand and respond to infectious disease risks.

10737633,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The AMPA type ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are ligand gated ion channels activated by the neu-
rotransmitter glutamate. They mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the brain and the signals
transduced by these complexes are critical for synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. AMPAR auxiliary sub-
units regulate trafficking and gating modulation of AMPARs. In this proposal we will investigate the mechanism
of AMPAR regulation by their auxiliary subunits. The core AMPAR auxiliary subunits are TARPs, GSG1L, and
cornichons (CNIHs). The TARPs are extensively studied and therapeutic compounds to alleviate seizure are
already available to target hippocampus enriched TARP gamma-8. GSG1L is a negative modulator of AM-
PARs, while TARPs and CNIHs serve as positive modulators. In humans, various residues located at the inter-
action interface between AMPAR and auxiliary subunits are intolerant to missense mutations, indicating their
critical roles in brain function. We hypothesize that different auxiliary subunits can co-assemble with the chan-
nel and produce a rich variety of gating modulations, which are fundamental in regulating synaptic transmission
and plasticity. To establish the structural and mechanistic basis, we will study complex AMPAR assemblies
that have high physiological relevance. In Aim 1 we hypothesize that fine structural differences among AMPAR
assemblies are fundamental for producing characteristic gating modulation and propose to reveal the architec-
tures of heterotetrameric AMPARs containing up to two types of auxiliary subunits at different functional states
in detergent using cryo-EM. By comparing the structures, new mechanistic models that could explain how aux-
iliary subunits control the time course and magnitude of gating are likely to emerge, which will be validated us-
ing electrophysiology. Next, currently available cryo-EM structures revealed the presence of lipids surrounding
the complex. We hypothesize that these lipids play important function in AMPAR gating modulation, which will
be tested in Aim2. Finally, we suggest that AMPAR/auxiliary subunit complex prepared in near physiological
conditions void of detergent must be studied to build more precise mechanistic models of its allosteric gating
modulation. In Aim 3, we propose to solve high resolution cryo-EM structures of AMPAR/auxiliary subunit
complex embedded in a lipid bilayer mimetic environment to resolve the known discrepancies between struc-
tures obtained in detergent and electrophysiology data. The role of auxiliary subunits in tuning ion channel gat-
ing kinetics is predicted to have significant impact on circuit dynamics. In summary, the outcomes of this study
are expected to advance our mechanistic understanding of AMPAR function and assist developing new thera-
peutic compounds that can alleviate dysregulation of AMPARs seen in neurological and psychiatric disorders,
such as Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, autism, Rasmussen’s and limbic encephalitis, and seizure."

Problem: Over half of women living with HIV (WLWH) have been exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV),
a rate 12 to 32 times higher than women nationally. IPV-exposed (vs. non-exposed) women have significantly
poorer engagement in HIV care and lower likelihood of viral suppression. Though integrated IPV-HIV
interventions exist, they focus on HIV risk reduction, which is less relevant to managing HIV day-to-day.
Attention to daily details is critical in this high-risk population - IPV-exposed WLWH face unique challenges
managing daily aspects of HIV. Purpose: The main purpose of this study is to understand how exposure to
IPV affects women's abilities to self-manage their HIV on a daily basis and to engage in longitudinal HIV care.
The study will also evaluate the effect of an IPV-health focused screening, brief intervention and referral to care
(SBIRT) protocol compared to standard of care on women's HIV care engagement. Methods: 315 adult
women living with HIV and ever exposed to IPV will be enrolled. Women who are “in-care” will be recruited
through Ryan White-funded HIV clinics. Women who are “out-of-care” will be recruited through Connecticut
Department of Public Health Disease Intervention Specialist outreach workers. After enrollment and a
baseline interview, women will complete 28 days of daily data collection on antiretroviral (ARV) adherence and
potential risk (substance use, depression/trauma symptoms, and IPV) and protective (emotion regulation, self-
efficacy) factors. At the month 3 follow-up study interview, women will be randomized to receive either an
IPV-health focused SBIRT or standard of care. Women will complete an exit study interview at month 6. Aims
(1) To identify proximal determinants of daily ARV adherence and determine if protective factors mediate and
violence characteristics moderate associations; (2) To characterize latent subgroups of WLWH based on
proximal determinants of daily ARV adherence and determine their relationship to retention in care and viral
suppression. (3) To test the effects of an IPV-health intervention, compared to standard of care on ARV
adherence, retention in care and viral suppression. Significance: Findings will inform the development of
future individual-level interventions in collaboration with community partners and their patients and a cluster
randomized trial of HIV clinics to assess the broader efficacy of a clinic-level intervention. IPV-exposed WLWH
are a key target population for scaling up the HIV care continuum. Successful treatment outcomes hinge on
optimal daily self-management. This project draws on the strengths of the study team to address the IPV-
health connection and improve the lives of women."

Alterations in cell metabolism support rapid growth and proliferation of cells in pathologies such as cancer, au-
toimmune disease, and heart ischemia, resulting in increased reliance on the metabolism of amino acids such
as glutamine and leucine. Nutrient Solute Carrier (SLC) transporters play a major role in reprogrammed meta-
bolic networks by supplying cells with nutrients that are used to build biomass, serve as signaling molecules that
enhance cell proliferation and differentiation, or regulate cell death. Our broad goal is to describe the sub-
strate and inhibitor specificity determinants in disease-related nutrient SLC transporters and develop
unique strategies to modulate their functions. We take an integrative approach that includes computational
chemistry methods, coupled with biochemical and biophysical approaches and disease-related cell lines, to char-
acterize two amino acid transporters that play a key role in metabolism of rapidly-growing cells: the Alanine-
Serine-Cysteine Transporter (SLC1A5, ASCT2), a Na+-dependent amino acid exchanger that modulates intra-
cellular glutamine levels, and the Amino Acid Transporter B0+ (ATB0+, SLC6A14), a neutral and cationic amino
acid transporter, driven by Na+ and Cl- co-transport.
In Aim 1 of this project, we will continue characterizing ASCT2, a well-validated drug target for various patholo-
gies (eg triple negative breast cancer and prostate cancer). Despite recent advancements in our understanding
of ASCT2 structure and function made by us and others, many aspects of its biology are highly unexplored. We
will rationally design chemical tools that modulate the activity of ASCT2 using unique mechanisms, including:
(A) allosteric inhibitors interacting with a recently identified allosteric site; (B) covalent inhibitors targeting a
unique cysteine residue in the substrate binding site of ASCT2; and (C) conformation-specific small molecule
modulators targeting specific subpockets in the substrate binding site. In Aim 2, we will characterize SLC6A14,
an understudied transporter involved in cancer and metabolic diseases. We will develop structural models of
SLC6A14 in different conformations. We will describe biophysical features of the models’ substrate binding site,
including electrostatic potential, size, shape, and hydrophobicity, to develop hypotheses for the substrate and
inhibitor specificity determinants in SLC6A14. We will use this knowledge to guide the development of inhibitors
and substrates, including photoactivatable compounds, to directly test inhibitor-binding site interaction(s).
Successful completion of this project will provide a greater understanding of mechanisms of transport and inhi-
bition of nutrient transporters, as well as novel chemical tools to further characterize their role in disease. Notably,
we will test an emerging and innovative approach to transporter drug discovery that targets allosteric modulation
and covalent inhibition via small molecules, to deprive hyper-proliferating cells of nutrients, potentially expanding
future applications to treat other diseases that involve SLCs."
10723097,"Stroke is the number one cause of disability in the US. This is a result of physical impairments as well as
increased risk of dementia after stroke. High blood pressure is the top risk factor for stroke followed by
diabetes. High blood pressure, diabetes and stroke are highly prevalent in our Veterans. Hypertension is the
most common vascular risk factor among Veterans with stroke. Moreover, among Veterans, hypertension is
the most common chronic condition, affecting more than 37% of the Veteran population. 25% of our Veterans
have diabetes. Despite years of extensive research, all efforts to protect neurons from ischemic stroke injury
failed. There is only one treatment for stroke and that is to open the occluded blood vessels with a clot-busting
drug. There is NO treatment for dementia that develops after stroke. Reasons for this failure may be several
fold: 1) researchers have used otherwise healthy and young animal models in research; 2) most studies
utilized male animals; and 3) researchers have tried to salvage and repair only ""neurons"". It is now increasingly
recognized that blood vessels of the brain are extremely critical for the acute stroke injury and chronic
recovery. When blood flow to the brain is compromised, cognitive impairment ensues and recovery from stroke
is impaired. Targets for new treatments may be different in females and/or diseases like diabetes and high
blood pressure that are commonly found in patients with stroke or cognitive impairment. This is also quite
relevant to VA mission as our female Veterans are steadily increasing among our Veterans and suffering from
these diseases necessitating the VA to launch the “Women’s Health Initiative”. Dr. Ergul, a well-accomplished
VA Research Career Scientist and Regents’ Professor at Augusta University, uses her uniquely combined
expertise in endocrinology, physiology, pharmacology and vascular biology to address these gaps by studying
the interaction of diabetes and high blood pressure with associated complications such as stroke and cognitive
impairment in both sexes. She is extremely committed to improve the quality of life of our Veterans and our
society, a commitment solidified by Research Career Scientist recognition in the last 5 years. Her commitment
to VA and cardiovascular disease research is evidenced by 1) continuous extramural finding by National
Institutes of Health, American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, and Veterans Affairs in the
last 20 years, 2) her over 150 publications (59 alone during the tenure of the RCS in the last 5 years), 3)
success of renewing VA Merit Award twice during the current RCS award period, 4) receiving additional
extramural funding to address complementary scientific questions, 5) her stature as a leader in the field and 6)
the success of her mentoring next generation of scientists."
10933507,"Project Summary
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Current clinical standard-of-care for
assessing metabolic dysfunction in AD is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET),
based on a temporoparietal pattern of hypometabolism. However, 1) PET is impractical as a longitudinal
assessment tool because it requires injection of a radioactive tracer, is expensive, and has poorer spatial
resolution and availability compared to MRI; and 2) FDG-PET may not be an accurate measure of neuronal
metabolism, because FDG signal can reflect glucose uptake by microglia and astrocytes for glycolysis, as well
as glucose uptake for oxidative phosphorylation by neurons. The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2),
reflective of oxidative phosphorylation in neuronal mitochondria, may more directly measure the abnormal
metabolism seen in patients with MCI and AD. Moreover, an MRI-based tool for mapping neuronal metabolism
would allow for longitudinal monitoring both clinically and in therapeutic trials. Therefore, the objective of this
proposal is to develop and optimize an MR-based CMRO2 mapping technique. Aim 1 will be to develop a multi-
echo gradient echo acquisition, integrated with arterial spin labeling to construct oxygen extraction fraction,
cerebral blood flow, and CMRO2 maps using sparsity fingerprinting. Aim 2 will investigate whether this CMRO2
mapping demonstrates regional correlation with well-established measures of AD pathology, including A, tau,
and FDG hypometabolism, the “ATN” stages of AD per the 2018 NIA-Alzheimer's Association research
framework. Aim 3 will investigate the value of our CMRO2 mapping in predicting longitudinal gray matter
degeneration and cognitive decline. If successful, this proposal will develop and validate a noninvasive,
quantitative MR-based tool to diagnose and longitudinally assess cerebral hypometabolism in AD."
10845556,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 40% of clinically used antibiotics act by binding to the ribosome and inhibiting protein synthesis. One
of the major mechanisms of resistance to these antibiotics results from the modification of the ribosome catalyzed
by Cfr, an enzyme encoded by chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance gene. By methylating the C8 position of a
conserved adenosine nucleotide in the peptidyl transferase center of the bacterial ribosome, this enzyme confers
resistance to phenicols, lincosamides, oxazolidinones, pleuromutillins, streptogramin A, hygromycin A,
nucleoside analog A201A and 16-member macrolides. This broad cross-resistance is unique to Cfr, and
represents a major clinical challenge, one that is further exacerbated by the presence of cfr on mobile genetic
elements, low fitness cost of its acquisition and its broad geographic distribution, as well as the ability to cause
resistance in both gram-positive (eg, methicillin-resistant S. aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (eg, pathogenic
E. coli). Cfr family is represented by over 600 unique sequences, with some member of the family sharing only
~50% sequence identity with the commonly investigated Cfr(A) enzyme from a clinical MRSA isolate. To date,
only a handful of Cfr enzymes have been functionally characterized.
Recent work on the structural basis of inhibition of translation by chloramphenicol and linezolid, an oxazolidinone
antibiotic, shows that both antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the ribosome-nascent peptide
complexes containing specific nascent peptide residues. Sequence-specific stalling mechanisms have been
exploited in nature to regulate inducibility of antibiotic resistance genes. Since cfr is often accompanied by
upstream elements that may regulate its expression, we will investigate if antibiotic-induced ribosome stalling
mechanisms may be involved in regulation of the expression of cfr resistance genes.
Using directed evolution under antibiotic selection, we have generated variants of Cfr with improved antibiotic
resistance properties. By improving enzyme expression and stability, these enzyme variants increase ribosomal
RNA methylation, leading to an increase in the proportion of the ribosomes that carry the protective modification.
Improved methylation of the ribosome has enabled structural determination of the Cfr-modified ribosome, which
we achieved using cryo-electron microscopy. The directed evolution mutants also provide a roadmap for our
future efforts to functionally annotate additional putative members of the vast and sequence-diverse Cfr enzyme
family. This will be achieved through in vitro reconstitution and in vivo validation of methylation of the conserved
adenosine nucleotide. Additionally, we will deploy an innovative strategy that relies on mechanism-based
crosslinking of Cfr with its substrates and next-generation sequencing of crosslinked RNAs to identify, with
nucleotide resolution, the sites of RNA methylation. Together, these studies have a potential to de-orphan
additional Cfr enzymes and lead to identification of new substrates and biological functions of this protein family."
10906227,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Family hypercholesterolemia
(FH) is an extreme case of inherited hypercholesterolemia and an important risk factor for CAD. FH is caused
by a single mutation in known cholesterol-related genes, and carriers of these mutations are exposed to severe
hypercholesterolemia and develop CAD at an early age. Early intervention has been shown to reduce the
progression of atherosclerosis and prolong CAD-free survival. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are
important in the management of FH.
Current guidelines recommend genetic screening and genotype-based risk stratification for people with severe
hypercholesterolemia, as well as specific therapies. However, current genetic diagnostic criteria are limited to
genes/variants that have already been described.
Recent investigations, including ours, suggest that the diagnostic yield of genetic testing for FH is limited (< 2%
of individuals with severe hypercholesterolemia). Furthermore, only ~2% have a similarly strong polygenic
contribution despite studies indicating a sizable contribution of genetics to FH. From these findings, Dr.
Koyama hypothesize that undiscovered FH alleles exist and may be important for diagnosis, surveillance, and
treatment. With the aim of improving genetic diagnostic yields for FH and capturing potential carriers currently
undiagnosed, Dr. Koyama proposes to develop an updated diagnostic criteria of FH using the population-scale
genome sequence cohorts and comprehensive variant interpretation framework.
In this proposal, first, Dr. Koyama will refine the list of FH associated variants/genes by associating ultrarare
coding variants in the whole exome datasets. Second, Dr. Koyama will extend the analysis to the noncoding
variants which were not conferred in the current diagnostic criteria using the whole genome sequencing
dataset. Finally, Dr. Koyama will integrate common and rare genetic risk stratification models to
comprehensively describe the genetic risk of hyperlipidemia.
This project is built on Dr. Koyama’s clinical/research skills and experiences and allows him to gain more
experience in genetic research in the cardiovascular disease. Under the mentorship of primary mentor Dr.
Pradeep Natarajan, the Director of Preventive Cardiology and co-mentor Dr. Patrick Ellinor, the Chief of
Cardiology of Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Koyama will significantly benefit from rich scientific
resources and collaborations at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and at the Division of Cardiology at the
Massachusetts General Hospital."
10894755,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Our past research has demonstrated that feelings of social disconnectedness and conflictual relationships are
factors that often undermine deterrents to suicide. Experiencing the death of a spouse or life partner is a
profoundly distressing event that may cause abrupt changes in one’s daily routine, including decreased self-
care and withdrawal from social activities. While most individuals adapt over time, a substantial number of
older bereaved spouses (20-35%) experience depression, loneliness, suicidal thoughts, and early mortality,
including death by suicide. Thus, late-life spousal bereavement provides a “natural experiment” in which to
study the impact of a well-defined and common social stressor on suicide risk in late life. The objective of this
R01 application is to examine the risk for and resilience to late-life suicide during the early spousal
bereavement period by investigating the extent to which (1) social connectedness influences suicide risk and
(2) whether circadian rhythm instability (inconsistent patterns of sleep, activity, meals, and socialization) helps
explain this association. We will enroll 169 spousally-bereaved adults aged 65 years or older, who currently
have at least subthreshold symptoms of depression or have a history of depression and/or suicide attempt. We
will include participants early after spousal death: during the first six months post loss. All participants will
complete repeated assessments over 12 months of multiple dimensions of social connectedness, clinical
assessments (depression and suicide ideation), and objective assessments of circadian rhythmicity
(actigraphy-derived 24-hour patterns of rest/activity, sleep onset and timing, and circadian phase advances or
delays). Thus, we will be able to investigate whether circadian rhythmicity and delayed sleep onset and timing
will be associated with higher suicide risk. Participants will also complete a behavioral probe, designed to
promote self-care behaviors in older bereaved spouses (called “WELL” or Widowed Elders’ Lifestyle After
Loss), a digital health intervention. WELL targets the timing and regularity of social activities, sleep, and meals
to determine whether modifying social connectedness reduces suicide risk and whether circadian rhythm
stability explains part of this association. Preliminary data indicate that WELL increases both (a) stability of
circadian rhythms (i.e., regular sleep, activity, meals, and socialization) and (b) social connectedness. We will
take full advantage of our longitudinal design and repeated assessments by using high-dimensional statistical
models to examine how longitudinal change in multiple dimensions of social connectedness relates to change
in circadian rhythm stability as a possible biobehavioral mechanism, and whether it directly and/or indirectly
effects suicide risk in late-life. The proposed research aligns with RFA MH-22-135 by identifying (1)
“mechanisms by which social disconnection confers risk for, and social integration protects against suicidal
thoughts and behaviors in late life;” and (2) ”biological and behavioral mechanisms that can be targets within
an experimental therapeutic approach of intervention development.”"

The goal of this proposal is to investigate the role of the gut microbiota and microbiota-specific
immune responses in health and disease. The gut microbiota has been associated with a
number of immune-based diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity, IBD and infections;
however, specific mechanisms remain unclear.
Our recent findings have shown that select members of the gut microbiota drive lymphatic
development and formation of tertiary lymphoid structures. Specifically, addition of an adherent
colonic-residing bacteria, Helicobacter hepaticus, supports lymphangiogenesis and tertiary
lymphoid structure formation within the colon of colorectal tumor-bearing mice. Ultimately, this
led to an increase in immune infiltration by T cells into the tumor core.
However, how select colonic bacteria drive lymphangiogenesis and support tertiary lymphoid
structure formation and maturation remains unknown. Project 1 of this proposal will identify the
key signals responsible for bacteria-drive lymphangiogenesis using spatio-temporal analysis.
Part 2 will investigate the cell subsets responsible for tertiary lymphoid structure formation due
to lymphangiogenesis and Part 3 will assess the direct and indirect roles of gut microbes in
lymphangiogenesis in health and disease. Our overall hypothesis is that colonization with
Helicobacter hepaticus drives lymphangiogenesis and tertiary lymphoid structure maturation
through upregulation of VEGF-driven reprogrammed Lyve1+ macrophages. Completion of these
aims will lead to a completely new field of study and understanding of lymphangiogenesis in the
adult host and will also establish the necessary foundation for my career as an independent
investigator."
10890875,"A foundational, unanswered question of neural metabolism is whether the dramatic reduction in glucose uptake
observed during aging and Alzheimer's disease progression is a cause or consequence of the functional decline
of neurons. Current methods for visualizing the dynamics and effects of metabolism in vivo are too limited to
determine if this plays a role in eventual neuronal dysfunction. Notably, neurons are thought to primarily use
glucose for redox protection via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), rather than for production of ATP by
glycolysis, and when glycolysis is upregulated in neurons in vitro it leads to elevated redox damage and
apoptosis. As neuronal stimulation can also temporarily increase glycolytic flux, this suggests there may be an
uncharacterized competitive regulation of glucose use towards balancing either ATP production or redox
protection. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to develop and utilize genetically-encoded biosensors for key
metabolites in C. elegans neurons to determine the relationship between elevated calcium activity, dynamic
states of glucose metabolism, and redox balance at single cell resolution. Thus, aim 1 of this proposal will utilize
the novel fluorescent sensor HYlight to dynamically measure changes in cellular glycolysis in vivo during
conditions of energy stress, such as with neuronal stimulation. The main goals of this aim are to (1) determine
the relationship between states of high ATP demand and induction of upregulated glycolysis, and (2) elucidate
the molecular mechanisms that enhance glycolysis under these conditions. Aim 2 will determine whether states
of high neuronal glycolysis also lead to increased redox sensitivity in single neurons. Genetically-encoded
biosensors for ROS and NADPH will be used to read out cellular redox state and enable development of an
assay for quantifying degradation in stimulation-induced calcium activity that results from cell-autonomous ROS
accumulation. Finally, the effects of reducing glucose within a single neuron over the lifespan of aging worms
will be compared in the context of calcium activity and behavior to determine whether these effects coincide with
those induced by elevated redox damage. This system described herein would provide a new avenue for
assessing the source and impact of ROS-induced decline and give significant insight into the importance of
balancing glucose metabolism in maintaining neuronal function and behavior during aging. Additionally, it will
provide important career development for the submitting candidate, who will train during the K99 phase under
the mentorship of Dr. Daniel Colón-Ramos at Yale University. This lab has significant expertise in behavioral
neuroscience, which will be critical for advancing the career goals of the candidate in linking single neuron biology
to behavioral changes during aging. This award will also support the candidate’s career goals by providing an
opportunity to learn critical research skills, mentorship expertise, and personalized guidance for navigating the
faculty job search. With this training the candidate will be able to successfully complete the proposed research
and transition to an independent faculty career."

I am a pulmonary critical care physician at the UMass Chan Medical School and a former scholar of the
Massachusetts Consortium for Cardiopulmonary Implementation Science program funded by an NIH K12 award.
My long-term goal is to be an implementation scientist with expertise in applying health informatics to promote
evidence-based practice in lung cancer prevention and control. During my K12, I completed a Master’s in Clinical
Investigation and received training in implementation science. However, I still have gaps in my training and seek
this K08 award to obtain additional training and mentoring to become a successful independent clinician-
scientist. Building upon the single patient strategy that I developed during my K12 project, I propose to develop
and pilot test a multi-strategy implementation program called “Facilitation of Information eXchange for Shared
Decision Making (FIX-SDM) for Lung Cancer Screening” for this K08. Although lung cancer screening is
recommended for high-risk individuals, it is underutilized. The known barriers to lung cancer screening are
difficulty identifying lung cancer screening eligible patients, lack of patient awareness, lack of provider
knowledge, and need for shared decision making. Because lung cancer screening has both benefits and risks,
shared decision making is recommended. However, shared decision making rarely happens in primary care
visits since patients and providers often lack the necessary information to conduct shared decision making during
the time-constrained visit. FIX-SDM is a multi-strategy technology-assisted implementation program that is
designed to support shared decision making and uptake of lung cancer screening by facilitating information
exchange in advance of patient visits. Using texting, FIX-SDM will help patients prepare for shared decision
making by delivering the information, collecting patient-generated data and providing feedback based on patient-
generated data. Leveraging patient-generated data via texting, FIX-SDM will provide the information and tools
that primary care providers (PCPs) need for shared decision making in the EHR. During this K08, I will develop
the new patient strategies in Aim 1 and the PCP strategies in Aim 2. In Aim 3, I will integrate both patient and
PCP strategies of FIX-SDM into the workflow of primary care clinics and conduct a pilot implementation study
comparing FIX-SDM and usual care of lung cancer screening uptake. Under the experienced mentorship of Drs.
Mazor, Houston, Wiener, Sadasivam, and Crawford, I will carry out the proposed research plan in consort with
a structured training plan focusing on mHealth, clinical informatics, patient-generated data, user-centered design,
health communication, study design, and statistical and qualitative analysis. At the end of the K08 award, I will
be poised to successfully compete for a R01 to conduct a large-scale pragmatic trial of FIX-SDM for LCS to
improve the uptake of and longitudinal adherence to annual lung cancer screening. My overall research goals
align with NCI’s mission to foster rapid integration of evidenced based practices in cancer prevention and control."
10913603,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
IgA vasculitis (IgAV) is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in children, characterized by IgA deposition
in the small blood vessels of skin, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and joints. Among patients with IgAV, 20%-55%
have renal involvement. Renal manifestations include hematuria, proteinuria, and variable degree of kidney
failure, leading to end stage renal disease in 2% cases. The exact pathogenesis of IgAV is currently unknown,
and there are no targeted treatments for IgAV. This proposal aims at uncovering pathogenic mechanism of IgAV
using human genetics and systems biology approaches. In Aim 1, we will use GWAS approach to discover novel
genetic factors for IgAV, nominate candidate disease-causing genes, and investigate shared genetic
determinants with other immune-mediated traits to facilitate drug repositioning. In Aim 2, we will study the global
landscape of immune cell type-specific expression and splicing QTLs in IgAV, identify IgAV-specific genomic
regulators for gene regulation, and intersection with GWAS loci to elucidate the functional consequences of IgAV
risk alleles and further prioritize candidate casual genes. In Aim 3, we will identify the driver genes through
reconstruction of disease context-specific and cell-type specific regulatory networks, and define causal genetic
alternations acting upstream of the driver genes. This will allow us to define the pathogenetic pathways based
on the prioritized driver genes and genetic alternations. Lastly, the prioritized pathogenetic drivers and variants
will be tested against clinical data to facilitate translation of these findings into clinical benefits. In summary, the
proposed research will provide new insights into the genetic determination and pathogenesis of IgAV,and will
significantly contribute to the development of new and improved strategies to detect, treat, and prevent IgAV. My
overarching career goal is to become an independent investigator with a focus on identifying therapeutic targets
for immune-mediated kidney diseases through systems genetics analyses of population-level multi-omics data.
During this 5-year K01 Career Development Award, I will expand my training in autoimmunity and precision
medicine and to acquire the skills necessary to conduct state-of-the-art population-based systems genetics
studies. In the last two years of the award, I will apply for R03 and R01 funding and transition to independence.
To guide and support my research and training goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship team of
experts in Nephrology and Complex Traits Genetics (Dr. Kiryluk, primary mentor), Systems Biology (Dr. Califano,
co-mentor), Statistical Genetics (Dr. Ionita-Laza, co-mentor), Molecular Genetics and Precision Medicine (Dr.

10726569,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a poorly understood disease that causes pathologic remodeling of the
smaller diameter vessels of the lung, leading to progressive heart failure. This proposal will support the
critically needed studies to advance our currently limited understanding of the development of pulmonary
hypertension. Launching from her career development award findings, the PI (Lavannya Pandit, MD) outlines
a five-year plan to investigate the mechanism by which the K2P (two-pore domain) family of potassium ion
channels attributed to vascular smooth muscle cells participates in the vascular remodeling targeted to the
smaller diameter resistance-vessels of the lung, a defining pathologic characteristic of pulmonary hypertension.
This work will be performed at the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs medical center (MEDVAMC), which is
affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine in the Texas Medical Center, Houston. Important collaborative studies
will be performed within neighboring institutions at the Texas Medical Center (University of Texas Health
Science Center and University of Houston.) The project has been developed with consultative guidance from
renowned experts in the field of ion channel and pulmonary vascular cell biology who will continue their active
participation over the five-year duration of the proposed studies. Preliminary microarray data from explanted
human PH pulmonary arteries implicated a role for K2P channel dysfunction. We hypothesize that the K2P ion
channel dysfunction causes pathologic growth and constriction of smooth muscle cells specific to the smaller
diameter resistance vessels. The scientific approach utilizes primary pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells
from both larger conduit and smaller resistance pulmonary vessels of both nonsmoking cadaveric controls and
explanted PH human lung tissues with parallel studies utilizing a mouse model of PH. We will test how
anatomic location determines specific K2P ion channels’ effect on the pulmonary vascular smooth cell
intracellular pathways for growth and contractility. The first objective of this proposal examines how anatomic
location within the pulmonary vascular bed affects K2P ion channel expression and function in vascular smooth
muscles. We will measure K2P channel expression, current density and resting membrane potential in
pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells, attributing changes in K2P ion channel expression and function to
anatomic origin. The second objective of this proposal maps the interaction between the K2P channel and
endothelin-1(ETR) and thromboxaneA2 receptors (TXA2) by measuring intracellular ETR and TXA2 trafficking
using a radioligand assay and confocal microscopic imaging. These results link anatomic location of the K2P
channels to smooth muscle cell receptor ligand signaling (vasoconstrictors: endothelin-1 and thromboxaneA2)
that are currently implicated in PH. The third objective is to establish a functional role of K2P ion channels in
the cellular processes leading to PH vascular remodeling by experimental genetic and pharmacologic
modification and restoration. At the conclusion of these translational human tissue studies, we will delineate
the role of K2P ion channels in the development of PH vasculopathy."
10726570,"The goal of this proposal is to investigate possible contributions of Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein
(APPswe) in skeletal muscles to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). App is a Mendelian gene for
early-onset AD. Swedish mutations in App favor APP cleavage to generate -amyloid (A). Much research on
AD has thus been focused on the impact of A on the brain, even though App and other AD risk genes are
known to be expressed not only in the brain, but also in periphery tissues.
 Here, we asked if altered APP metabolism in skeletal muscles has any contribution to AD-relevant brain
pathology, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms, for the following reasons. First, although AD is
pathologically characterized by cortical and cerebrovascular A plaques, phospho-tau containing neurofibrillary
tangles, reactive glial cell-associated chronic brain inflammation, and hippocampal neuronal loss, AD patients
often have lower lean-mass (mass of skeletal muscle and bone) and weight-loss, which are associated with the
severity of dementia and AD progression. Second, examinations of skeletal muscle structures in Tg2576, a
well-characterized AD animal model that expresses APPswe ubiquitously and develops some AD-relevant brain-
pathologic deficits, revealed muscle-weakness phenotype as early as 3-MO (month old), months before
any brain-pathologic defect that can be detected. Third, in addition to Tg2576, we generated
a conditional transgenic mouse model capable of cell-type specific expression of APPswe in Cre-dependent
manner. Selective expression of APPswe in skeletal muscles by crossing floxed APPswe transgene with human
skeletal -actin (HSA) promoter driven Cre (TgAPPsweHSA) resulted in not only muscle deficits [e.g., reduced
compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and increased denervation at neuromuscular junction (NMJ) at 3-
MO], but also brain phenotypes (e.g., impaired hippocampal neurogenesis at 3-MO and increased reactive
gliosis in cortex of 7-MO). These results demonstrate not only a cell autonomous role of APPswe in
suppressing adult NMJ maintenance and accelerating skeletal muscle aging, but also a cell-non-autonomous
role in the brain. Fourth, to understand how muscle APPswe affects brain cells, we characterized APPswe+
muscles and muscle cells (C2C12) expressing APPswe, and observed an elevation of cellular senescence,
including increases in p16Ink4a and senescence associated -galactosidase (SA--Gal) and a decrease in
C2C12 cell growth. The factors of senescence associated secretary phenotype (SASP) were also increased in
TgAPPsweHSA muscles and their circulation blood.
 In light of these observations, we hypothesize that APPswe expression in skeletal muscles may
contribute to AD pathology by increasing muscle senescence and SASP factors. We will test this
hypothesis by the accomplishment of the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis
that APPswe in skeletal muscles increases brain cell senescence and promotes AD-relevant deficits in the brain.
In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that increased muscle cellular senescence contributes to NMJ and brain
deficits in TgAPPsweHSA mice. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that SASP factors, such as hepcidin, from
APPswe-expressing muscles are necessary for brain cell senescence and AD pathology.
 It is our hope that the results will reveal a novel link of muscular APPswe with AD brain pathology, a
prerequisite to develop better diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for AD that occurs at higher rate among
veterans."
10726571,"Nearly half of US adults have hypertension. Hypertension is also highly prevalent in the VA Health
System. Traditionally, hypertension has been thought to be a function of abnormalities in the renal,
vascular, and nervous systems. In recent years, clinical and basic science data clearly demonstrate that
there is crosstalk between the nervous and immune systems, and the neuro-immune axis plays an integral
part in development of hypertension.
 The neuro-immune axis describes a regulatory, bidirectional interaction between the autonomic
nervous and immune systems. Activation of the nicotinic arm of this axis leads to both anti- and pro-
inflammatory immune responses. We discovered that activation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with
nicotine (a non-selective agonist), both in vitro and in vivo, induces an inflammatory M1 macrophage
population that infiltrates the renal medulla and leads to the development of hypertension in the genetic
Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR) model of essential hypertension. Our long-term goal is to develop
novel therapeutic agents to target this cholinergic arm of the neuro-immune axis in human essential
hypertension. The short-term goal of this proposal is to identify the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
involved in this cholinergic arm, and to explore their role in the development of essential
hypertension.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a specific arm of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated
immune response favors inflammatory mechanisms to promote the development of hypertension. This
hypothesis is grounded in novel and exciting preliminary data showing that the alpha4beta2 subtype
of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is upregulated in immune cells in the SHR model of essential
hypertension, and that selective activation of the alpha4beta2nicotinic acetylcholine receptor leads
to the development of hypertension. Using state-of-the-art in vivo and in vitro molecular and cellular
approaches, as well as in vivo hemodynamics, this proposal will 1) determine the role of the
alpha4beta2 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in pro-inflammatory immune cells
responses; 2) explore whether the alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor plays a causal role
in the development and maintenance of essential hypertension; and 3) examine whether splenic
innervation promotes expansion of immune cells endowed with the alpha4beta2 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor, and thus an inflammatory phenotype, in essential hypertension.
Essential hypertension is the most prevalent cardiovascular condition in the VA Health System and
remains undertreated. Major gaps in our understanding of the neuro-immune axis limit our ability
to treat hypertension. This application provides a unique opportunity to better understand this axis
and may therefore open the door for new anti-hypertensive therapeutics."

The overarching mission of this project is to develop a Center entitled PRE-Clinical Interagency reSearch
resourcE-Traumatic Brain Injury (PRECISE-TBI) with the mission of accelerating the development of therapies
for TBI. PRECISE-TBI will achieve this mission by utilization of an enterprise approach to meet key objectives
with targeted strategies. We will also leverage previous collaborative efforts. The organizational structure of
PRECISE-TBI incorporates elements from business models and from other research consortia. The strategic
missions of the Center are divided into five Cores and milestones will be achieved by activities of Core
Directors and members. Leadership of PRECISE-TBI will be the Core Directors (Drs. Dixon, Gurkoff,
VandeVord, Martone, LaPlaca, Harris, Floyd) and the Steering Committee Chair, Dr. Adam Ferguson.
Leadership will interact with a Steering Committee (comprised of persons representing clinical expertise, other
VA programs, other agencies, and all model types) to set objectives, milestones, and deliverables. We will
have a Community Committee to be comprised of 100+ persons with wide TBI knowledge and perspectives.
Committee members will be divided into task-oriented subcommittees, with oversight/guidance from
Leadership and the Steering Committee. Core Directors, Steering Committee Chair, and the Steering
Committee members are carefully selected to provide diversity and inclusion in TBI expertise, geographic
location, funding history, gender identity, seniority, and research focus. Expertise in both acute and chronic TBI
as well as pediatric TBI models will be included. Representatives from industry and non-profit organizations are
included in the Steering Committee. The AO/Scientific Writer will compose drafts of documents for finalizing by
Committee members. The organization structure of PRECISE-TBI connects investigators in both the Steering
Committee and in the Community Committee which facilitates efficiency and wide-range engagement. Each of
the Cores has an overarching objective that will be met by aims and milestones. The mission of the
Administration Core is to promote effective and efficient communication and interactions between all elements
of PRECISE-TBI. The working perspective is that the TBI investigators will act as both “employees” and
“customers.” This dual role is because TBI investigators will be engaged to develop (employees) and use
(customer) the consensus statements and translational roadmaps. The overarching goal of the Preclinical
Model Catalogue Core is the creation, dissemination and maintenance of an online catalogue of preclinical
models of TBI as well as create a database of preclinical TBI outcomes that are ontological to human TBI
pathologies. The Common Data Elements Core mission is to develop and then benchmark new and existing
common data elements using existing data from funded consortia and data from new endeavors. The
Informatics Core seeks to fuel knowledge discovery through the development and implementation of a

10726619,"The incidence of anal cancer, which is largely caused by sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses (HPVs),
has been increasing for many years, especially in people living with human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV+).
The Department of Veterans Affairs cares for the largest population of people living with human
immunodeficiency virus of any healthcare system in the nation. One opportunity for preventing this deadly
cancer lies in the effective treatment of precancerous anal intraepithelial neoplasia (hereafter referred to as
anal dysplasia). Unfortunately, current treatments for anal dysplasia are ineffective, with high recurrence rates
and unwanted, long-term side effects. Dr. Carchman’s laboratory studies anal carcinogenesis in a well-
validated, HPV-transgenic model. Through collaborations Dr. Carchman also has access to a new conditional
transgenic mouse model to study anal carcinogenesis to facilitate mechanistic studies and test therapeutic
agents. Dr. Carchman has identified autophagic dysfunction due to HPV16 E6 and E7 expression that results
in anal cancer development. Dr. Sherer’s laboratory has determined that HIV-1 protease inhibitors result in the
degradation of HPV E6 and E7, which prevent the destruction of p53, a potent inducer of autophagy. These
findings have led the team to pursue preclinical studies that re-purpose HIV protease inhibitors—previously an
integral part of HIV treatment—in a topical form to treat anal dysplasia and prevent cancer development. While
protease inhibitors have been shown to induce autophagy in several preclinical and clinical studies, they have
not been examined in anal dysplasia treatment. The overall hypothesis is that autophagic induction with
topical protease inhibitors will prevent the progression of anal dysplasia in preclinical models of anal
carcinogenesis, thus providing an effective therapeutic option to prevent HPV-associated anal cancer in
humans. The goal of this proposal is to utilize novel preclinical models of HIV-associated anal carcinogenesis,
which include a single-cell culture where E6 and E7 are green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged, an
established HPV-transgenic model, and a conditional HPV transgenic model that will undergo immune
modulation to recapitulate HIV infection. The team is uniquely positioned to carry out this proposed study. Dr.
Carchman has clinical expertise in anal dysplasia and anal cancer and is the leader of the anal
dysplasia/cancer clinic at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The group also has extensive expertise with
preclinical models for anal carcinogenesis. These models recently yielded the key observation that autophagy
is important for inhibiting anal carcinogenesis—a discovery that drives the proposal’s central premise that HIV
protease inhibitors, known to induce autophagy, can be re-purposed as topical agents to prevent anal cancer.
The team’s work brings a cancer-relevant problem in the context of an HIV infection back into focus. This
research is well-grounded in existing methodology, supported by preliminary data, and holds promise for new
treatments to prevent HPV-associated cancers. The project will also advance the development of innovative
preclinical models for studying anal carcinogenesis and testing new therapies."

RNA molecules participate in the most fundamental cellular processes implicated in human disease. Many
RNAs contain structured modules that make critical contributions to RNA functions and represent attractive
drug targets, especially for diseases without a cure and associated with “undruggable” proteins. Knowledge of
the three-dimensional structures of these RNAs would help to understand the mechanism of the RNA function
and could greatly accelerate drug discovery efforts. However, traditional methods for RNA structure
determination, X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, are laborious and have serious technical
limitations. Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has many advantages over crystallography
and NMR but is applicable only for large molecules or macromolecular assemblies and cannot be used for the
majority of natural RNAs because of their insufficient size. This proposal is focused on developing a novel
approach for preparing cryo-EM samples of RNA that circumvents the size restrictions, omits the RNA
purification and RNA refolding steps, and allows facile cryo-EM data processing and structure solution. The
proposed proof-of-concept study combines three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 is devoted to the development
of the novel biochemical approach for preparing uniform RNA species by in vitro transcription. Specific Aim 2
will use computational modelling, biochemical assays, and single-particle cryo-EM experimentation to develop
a methodology for preparing cryo-EM samples compatible with the structure solution of small- and medium-
sized RNAs. Aim 3 will validate the methodology using model RNA molecules and conventional single particle
cryo-EM structure solution pipeline. The proposal integrates computational methods, biochemical assays, and
cryo-EM-based structure determination to develop a universal and simple approach for solving structures of
the majority of RNA and RNA-drug complexes. The proposed technology is anticipated to be superior to the
existing methods in labor, cost, and applicability."
10899583,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Between 2000 and 2020, Asian Americans were the fastest growing racial group in the US, increasing from 10.5
million to 24 million individuals. By 2060, the number of US Asians is projected to rise to 46 million, more than
triple their 2000 population. Although Asian Americans (AAs) are commonly viewed as a 'model minority' based
on socioeconomic and health indicators, AAs actually have chronic disease rates that converge with or exceed
those of US whites and are at higher risk for several cardiometabolic disorders despite having lower rates of
obesity. However, due to limited data and the common practice of reporting aggregated data across multiple AA
subgroups, the true extent and nature of the disparities that exist is not well understood. Thus, to address
important gaps in the field, we propose to establish the Asian American Community Cohort and Equity Study
(ACCESS) spanning across the greater Philadelphia-New Jersey-New York City region, which will include 2,400
men and women ages 25-64 drawn from 3 US Asian subgroups: Chinese (n=800), Vietnamese (n=800), and
Filipino (n=800). Our multidisciplinary team will leverage our 22-year established PA-NJ-NYC Regional Network
of collaborative community-based organization partners, clinical providers, city health departments, and
academic investigators to support the cohort’s infrastructure and the recruitment of diverse research participants
with respect to nativity, language, and generational status. With collaboration from our esteemed Community
Advisory Board and Scientific Advisory Board members, our team has a strong and successful record of scientific
productivity and expertise in: 1) the conduct of community-engaged longitudinal cohort studies with AA
populations; 2) rigorous assessment of dietary intake and other health behaviors and lifestyle factors; 3)
standardized measures of social determinants of health (SDoH) and neighborhood-level exposures; 4) collection
of high-quality biospecimens for analysis of biologic markers; and 5) assessment of cardiometabolic outcomes
(e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease). The overall objectives of this application are to
establish a rigorous infrastructure of ACCESS including formalizing clinical/community partnerships, developing
cohort infrastructure, and establishing study protocols to support the standardized collection of comprehensive
psychosocial, behavioral, and neighborhood-level data, along with biospecimens and other clinical exams. The
proposed activities are closely aligned with NHLBI’s Strategic Vision and will address key research questions
regarding how the prevalence of cardiometabolic disorders varies across Asian ethnic subpopulations, how
SDoH relates to disease risk in specific subpopulations, and the identification of behavioral and biologic
pathways that may account for individual or group differences in disease risk. This synergistic multidisciplinary
plan to establish a prospective comprehensive cohort that includes 3 large AA subgroups will yield a rich resource
to support rigorous research on multi-level pathways contributing to cardiometabolic disease risk and health
outcomes in these large and growing, but understudied populations that experience significant disparities."
10861078,"Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium and the most prevalent sexually transmitted
infection in the United States. If untreated, infection can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic
pregnancy, and infertility. Although C. trachomatis infection is treatable with antibiotics, many cases are
asymptomatic, and repeat infections are common. Therefore, a vaccine is the best public health solution for
managing and preventing infection. To develop a truly effective vaccine, it is critical to understand how C.
trachomatis evades adaptive immunity to establish persistent infection during natural infection. CD8 T cells are
normally integral for controlling intracellular pathogen infections, but during C. trachomatis infection, the CD8 T
cell response is significantly impaired. We have shown that upregulation of the immunoinhibitory ligand PD-L1
during infection contributes to the diminution of the CD8 T cell response. Here we propose to identify C.
trachomatis virulence genes that are responsible for upregulating PD-L1, as we hypothesize that these
virulence genes are necessary to manipulate CD8 T cell immunity. In our first aim, we propose two
complimentary approaches to identify C. trachomatis genes responsible for PD-L1 upregulation during
infection. The first is to create and screen a lentiviral library containing individual C. trachomatis genes, testing
the ability of individual bacterial genes to upregulate PD-L1. The second approach is based on a fortuitous
phenotype in HeLa cells where only C. muridarum and not C. trachomatis is capable of upregulating PD-L1. By
using a C. trachomatis/C. muridarum chimera collection developed by collaborators, we will identify portions of
the C. muridarum chromosome that are sufficient to upregulate PD-L1. After generating a list of gene
candidates from these two approaches, we will create C. trachomatis strains with null mutations in genes
responsible for upregulating PD-L1 (CtNP), to validate their necessity for PD-L1 upregulation during infection in
vitro and in vivo. In aim 2, we will use the CtNP strains to test if bacterial genes responsible for PD-L1
upregulation are required to manipulate the CD8 T cell response and hinder CD8 T cell-mediated protection.
First, we will compare the proliferation and homing of C. trachomatis specific CD8 T cells during the course of
infection with CtNP strains or WT C. trachomatis. Secondly, we propose to evaluate the protective capacity of
memory CD8 T cells isolated from mice infected with CtNP strains or WT C. trachomatis by performing CD8 T
cell transfer experiments into naïve mice. This work will provide the foundation for future studies to interrogate
the mechanism by which C. trachomatis upregulates PD-L1. By understanding how C. trachomatis impairs the
T cell response, we can develop vaccines that stimulate superior immunity compared to natural infection."

Cryptococcal disease, caused by basidiomycete yeasts of the genus Cryptococcus, represents a sub-
stantial global health burden. Cryptococcus neoformans, the most common infectious agent, is ubiq-
uitous in the environment and it is likely that most people are exposed to multiple genetically
and phenotypically diverse Cryptococcus strains throughout their lifetimes. Despite this, human
cryptococcosis has historically been studied under the assumption that a majority of infections are
caused by single pathogenic strains. As a result, little is known about the incidence and prevalence
of multi-strain or mixed-species cryptococcal infections or their clinical impact.
 In a preliminary study of patient samples from the Duke University Hospital System we de-
tected a surprisingly high number of mixed Cryptococcus infections. We now propose to charac-
terize the population genomic structure and epidemiological correlates of mixed Cryptococcus in-
fections, using a set of more than 500 patient samples from the southeastern US collected over the
last 30 years. We will analyze phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity within these patient samples
to identify mixed infections, and combine these data with with population genomic and phyloge-
netic analyses of environmental isolates from the same geographic region to understand the en-
vironmental origins of mixed infections. Information on the frequency and population structure
of mixed infections will be correlated with epidemiological analyses of patient demographics and
health outcomes to understand who is likely to get mixed Cryptococcus infections and what such
infections mean for health outcomes. We will also explore the impact of phenotypic heterogeneity,
a key characteristic of mixed infections, on sensitivity to antifungal drugs and interactions with
the host immune system."

The structural biology and molecular modeling market is expected to reach USD 18.1 Billion with a Compound
Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 17.1% during the forecast period of 2022-2028 which has the potential to drive
substantial demand for a workforce of the future. While the significance of advancement in cutting-edge Cryo-
EM data processing to improve and accelerate drug discovery to treat diseases is driving innovation and
economic growth and happening in the pharma industry, many structural biology investigators and would-be
investigators are caught without the enhanced research training to use rapidly evolving and sophisticated
computational tools, including AI and deep learning tools, proficiently to help the pharma industry accelerate
drug discovery for society. Underrepresented minority (URM) representation in cutting-edge biomedical research
fields is not expected to be higher than what was reported in a 2019 NSF survey, which showed URM as a
percentage of the academic doctoral workforce at 8.9%, or a 2021 AAMC report which found diversity for URM
at academic leadership ranks in American academic medical colleges at about 5.8%. In particular, the high costs
associated with Cryo-EM research present a significant barrier for smaller institutions like Minority Serving
Institutions (MSIs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to train their students for the
structural biology-based biomedical career of the future.
To address these challenges, the Structural Biology Grid (SBGrid) Consortium at Harvard Medical School and
Meharry Medical College, an HBCU, will extend their existing partnership to improve diversity and deliver an
enhanced research training program across the entire community for structural biology investigators on the
current Cryo-EM data processing workflow that includes AI components, necessary skills, knowledge, and best
practices to help them stay on top and be productive in their careers in the biomedical research workforce.
Additionally, the program is designed not just to impart training for the principal investigator participants but also
to increase sustainability and scalability by enabling them with an evidence-based, integrated gear of data
science training model and system for structural biology comprising a complete set of training program material
with training datasets, a collection of structural biology data analysis and visualization software, and a
sustainable training and computing environment with supporting resources that they could use in their home
institutions to provide continuing education and longitudinal mentoring to their laboratory members and students
who are pursuing next-generation biomedical careers in structural biology."

The persistence of the latent viral reservoir remains a hurdle for the cure of chronic HIV infection. Finding an
effective and non-toxic means to purge and expose the viral reservoir has been elusive and is considered a
major barrier to the cure. Because of their pivotal role in the initiation and regulation of adaptive T cell immunity,
dendritic cells (DC) have been a therapeutic target for both cancer and HIV. Our most recent findings show that
with optimal programming, DC have the provocative potential to both drive expansion of HIV-specific cytotoxic
T cell lymphocytes (CTL), and to effectively induce HIV latency reversal (LR) to expose the infected cells for CTL
targeting and elimination. We have determined that our specialized IL-12p70-producing type-1 polarized
monocyte derived DC therapeutic platform (MDC1) can facilitate HIV LR when loaded with either CMV or HIV
immunogenic peptides, suggesting that a considerable component of the HIV cellular reservoir is contained
among CMV- and HIV specific CD4+ T cells. Here we propose the optimization of MDC1-based immunotherapy
strategy that utilizes MHC class II associated CMV epitopes along with highly conserved MHC class I restricted
HIV peptides as combined antigenic components designed to facilitate both the exposure of CD4+ T cells
harboring latent HIV (the ‘kick’) and their elimination by HIV specific CTL (the ‘kill’). In our proposed studies we
will dig deeper into the mechanisms involved, and we will translate our in vitro findings to test this approach in
vivo using a humanized mouse model of HIV infection and MDC1 immunotherapy."

The extent of tau pathology throughout the brain correlates with both synapse loss and severity of cognitive

relies on the preservation and maintenance of synaptic networks. Therefore, understanding the mechanism by
which tau contributes to network and synapse vulnerability is critical for developing preventative therapeutics.
The goal of this proposal is to determine the cellular mechanism(s) by which pathologic tau drives neuronal

intellectual and technical training for a successful transition into a postdoctoral position. The F99 phase (Aim 1)
will test mechanistic cell biological hypotheses to better define how abnormal tau accumulation induces synaptic
dysfunction, while providing opportunity to develop intricate experimental design and execution skills through
cutting-edge biochemistry, microscopy, and electrophysiology techniques. The K00 phase (Aim 2) will build upon
the F99 studies with computational strategies to integrate proteomics data from humans and experimental
models to identify co-existing molecular changes that are highly relevant to age-related tauopathies."

Growth of lymphatic vessels from pre-existing vessels is achieved via lymphangiogenesis. The mechanisms that
control lymphangiogenesis remain incompletely understood. VEGF-C binding to, and activation of, its cognate
receptor VEGFR3 is the most well-studied pro-lymphangiogenic pathway known, and is necessary for the
formation, migration and proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Indeed, humans and mice harboring
dominant negative mutations in VEGFR3 feature hypoplastic lymphatic vessels. In contrast, VEGF-C
overexpression in mice results in lymphatic vessel overgrowth and dysplasia. Hence, a delicate balance of
VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling is necessary for the proper patterning of the lymphatic vasculature. We have
identified laminar shear stress (LSS) as an enhancer of VEGF-C signaling. We have also identified the G protein-
coupled receptor (GPCR) sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1PR1) as an antagonist of VEGF-C
signaling that is enhanced by LSS. We will dissect the mechanisms by which LSS and S1PR1 regulate VEGF-
C signaling. We will also investigate the significance of this mechanism during health and disease by using
mouse models."

Prostate cancers, currently the most common cancer in men, demonstrate a tremendous range of biologic
diversity. Clinical assessments of response to non-surgical therapy are often inadequate because, as studies
have shown, they lead to inaccuracies when they rely upon serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels
reaching a nadir, or upon the histological confirmation of cancer using transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies.
When progressing to metastatic cancer, typically after androgen deprivation therapy, castrate resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) results in bone lesions in more than 90% of cases. There remains a critical clinical need for
greater sensitivity and specificity in molecular imaging biomarkers of prostate cancer presence and of response
to novel therapeutics.
An extraordinary new technique, hyperpolarized magnetic resonance (HP MR), has the potential to change the
way we interrogate metabolism in vivo. Through the utilization of 13C-labeled endogenous substrates, we are
able to non-invasively image a metabolic intermediate and its subsequent downstream products using
conventional MRI. In the setting of prostate cancer, this provides a potentially invaluable tool for the study of
prostate cancer metabolism and its modulation as a function of tumor aggressiveness and response to
therapeutic intervention. Unfortunately, we are currently limited in our ability to visualize large volumes of
interest, whereas metastatic prostate cancer typically requires visualization of the abdomen and bone regions,
virtually inaccessible to current HP MRI approaches.
The objective of this innovative academic industrial partnership is to address this problem by developing a
large-field-of-view HP MRI approach, including both hardware and software. This proposal would establish a
robust platform to enable the imaging of metastatic disease in prostate cancer patients. In the first aim of this
proposal we will develop a novel 13C body transmit coil and receive system capable of imaging the abdomen.
In tandem, we will also develop acquisition strategies to take advantage of this hardware for rapid HP MRI.
Finally, we will validate this approach in 2 cohorts of metastatic prostate cancer patients. The first will be imaged
with HP [1-13C] pyruvate to assess methods to visualize downstream glycolysis and the second with [2-13C]
pyruvate to image the TCA cycle for a first-in-human study.
It is the overarching goal of this proposal to build a novel, large-field-of-view approach to HP MRI – including,
importantly, both hardware and software – and apply it to the imaging of HP pyruvate metabolism in cancer
patients so as to provide benchmark for future studies using this technique, and additionally to determine its
ability to inform on prostate biology."

10740903,"Acute leukemia is a group of diseases associated with various genetic alterations that block differentiation and
increase proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients have very poor
prognosis with currently available treatments, reflected by a 5-year survival rate of only 27%. Dysregulation of
HOX genes is associated with numerous malignancies, including acute leukemias. In AML high level of HOX
genes, in particular HOXA9, is associated with refractory disease and very poor prognosis, emphasizing the
urgent need for novel therapies. Therefore, small molecules that reduce HOX genes expression might represent
a novel promising treatment strategy for acute leukemia patients. ASH1L (Absent, small or homeotic 1-like) is a
histone methyltransferase, which belongs to the Trithorax group of proteins regulating HOX genes expression.
ASH1L knockdown studies have demonstrated a critical role of ASH1L in development of leukemia's with
translocations of the MLL gene through regulation of HOXA9 and MEIS1 expression. Our own studies have
validated that the SET domain of ASH1L plays a critical role in leukemogenesis, both in the context of MLL-
rearranged leukemias and other high HOXA leukemias. Importantly, Ash1l-deficient mice exhibit no overt
hematopoietic failure in the steady-state conditions. Based on all these findings we believe that the ASH1L SET
domain represents a valid target in acute leukemias with high HOXA expression.
 In this project, we propose to develop small molecule inhibitors of ASH1L histone methyltransferase as
a potential therapeutic strategy for acute leukemias with high HOXA expression. To this end, we identified very
promising class of small molecules that bind to the SET domain of ASH1L and inhibit its enzymatic activity and
substantially optimized their potency, resulting in compounds with nanomolar binding affinities and high
selectivity to ASH1L These compounds inhibit proliferation, induce differentiation and downregulate expression
of HOXA genes in MLL leukemia cells, demonstrating highly specific mode of action. In this project we will
optimize ASH1L inhibitors to further improve their potency and drug-like properties with the goal to develop
compounds suitable for in vivo efficacy studies in AML models. In Aim 1 we will employ medicinal chemistry to
improve potency and drug-like properties, including metabolic stability, cellular permeability and solubility, of the
lead compounds we already identified. In Aim 2 we will carry out extensive characterization of ASH1L inhibitors
in a panel of acute leukemia cells with high and low level of HOXA genes expression to assess their potency,
mechanism of action and specificity. Aim 3 will be devoted to assess the in vivo efficacy of ASH1L inhibitors in
disseminated models of acute leukemia. We expect the outcome of these studies will result in very potent and
selective ASH1L inhibitors that might provide novel therapeutic approach for acute leukemias."

Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are large multiprotein channels that connect the nucleus with the cytoplasm. In
addition to their role in controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport, NPCs play key roles in gene expression
regulation. The molecular mechanisms employed by NPCs and its components (nucleoporins) to regulate gene
expression in mammalian cells are still poorly understood. Recent evidence indicates that NPCs have important
functions in the immune system. CD4+ T lymphocytes are central players of the adaptive immune response.
These cells assist B cells with antibody production, help CD8+ T lymphocytes to clear infections and to control
tumor growth, stimulate macrophage activity, recruit immune cells to sites of active infection and inflammation,
and exert regulatory roles that are essential to control the extent of the immune response. CD4+ T lymphocytes
activate through the stimulation of their T cell receptor (TCR) at the plasma membrane. TCR engagement results
in the initiation of the TCR signaling cascade that regulates T cell activation, proliferation, function and survival.
We recently identified that the nuclear pore complex component Nup210 has a critical role in the transmission
of TCR signals, and in the activation and survival of CD4+ T cells. We found that Nup210 regulates T cell
activation by modulating gene expression in response to TCR stimulation. Our findings suggest that a
coordinated activity between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope is required for the proper
transmission of TCR signals and the efficient expression of TCR-induced genes. In this proposal we aim to
establish how the TCR stimulation signal is communicated from the plasma membrane to Nup210 at NPCs (Aim
1), to dissect how Nup210 regulates the transcriptional activity NFAT and STAT transcription factors during TCR
signaling (Aim 2), and to uncover the role of the Caveolin 2 protein in Nup210-regulation of TCR-induced gene
expression (Aim 3). Besides offering novel insights into the mechanisms of gene expression modulation by
nucleoporins, we expect our work will result in the characterization of a new mechanism of regulation of T cell
function that could potentially be exploited to modulate T cell activity in immune-based therapies."
10901954,"Abstract
Vulnerability to relapse despite prolonged abstinence is a principal feature of drug addiction. Decades of
research have expanded our understanding of the neural basis of relapse, but have yielded few effective
treatments that restore top-down control over drug seeking in active and former users. In animal models,
repeated drug use, but not repeated exposure to natural rewards, results in excess glutamate transmission within
corticofugal projections to the striatum in the presence of reward-associated cues and contexts that drive
seeking. This behavioral paradigm has been used to model neural adaptations that trigger relapse, since
reactivity to drug-related cues is linked to drug craving in humans. The dysregulation of glutamate transmission
after chronic heroin use arises in part from enduring changes in peripheral astrocyte processes that insulate
active synapses and express the glutamate transporter GLT-1, consistent with a growing literature that illustrates
a prominent role for this cell type in maintaining the integrity of excitatory synaptic transmission. My published
data show that astrocytes in the NAcore undergo profound transient morphological plasticity in response to drug-
but not sucrose-conditioned cues and that this plasticity serves to attenuate seeking behavior. Heroin-associated
cues also stimulate an increase in surface-proximity of GLT-1 on the astroglial membrane, an adaptation
expected to limit glutamate spillover during relapse in preclinical models. The goal of this proposal is to explore
whether measures of astroglial plasticity that I have discovered are linked to transmitter release from cortical
projections within the NAcore and to uncover intracellular signaling events that trigger morphological plasticity in
astrocytes during drug-seeking. A final goal of this proposal is to determine whether cue-induced astrocyte
adaptations impact different post-synaptic targets, since the two principle neuronal subtypes in the NAcore, D1-
and D2-MSNs differentially impact drug seeking behavior. In Aim 1, I will combine confocal microscopy with in
vivo fiber photometry in order to identify the time course of astroglial plasticity during a 2-hr reinstatement
session. In Aim 2, I will pair optogenetics with confocal microscopy to determine whether glutamate from
prelimbic cortical terminals is necessary to drive astrocyte motility and GLT-1 surface diffusion after extinction
from heroin self-administration. In Aim 3, I will interfere with the signaling cascade that drives astrocyte process
motility during seeking using viral-mediated delivery of shRNAs selectively in astrocytes. Finally, in Aim 4 I will
use confocal microscopy in transgenic D1- and D2-Cre rats to determine whether astrocyte processes or surface-
proximal GLT-1 are selectively associated with D1- or D2-MSNs during cue-reinstated seeking. These Aims will
provide me with comprehensive training in optogenetics as well as with viral tools that will allow me to selectively
manipulate protein expression in astrocytes and will link my previous findings with the underlying neural circuitry.
The relevance of this work extends beyond relapse to opioids and may have implications for normal synaptic
physiology underlying motivated behavior."

care teams to better conduct goals of care (GOC) discussions more efficiently and thus increase
the number of GOC discussions held as compared to controls. We will deliver the AD ACP Toolkit
to 10 intervention primary care clinics and usual care to 10 control clinics using a computerized
case-finding algorithm within a large integrated health care system. Our first aim is to conduct a
trial comparing the AD ACP Toolkit to usual care on GOC discussions and other ACP measures
(N=800). The second aim is to examine the 18-month healthcare utilization outcomes for all PLwD
with >50% 5-year mortality risk between intervention and control (N=2,660). We will conduct
secondary analyses to examine outcomes by key patient and team characteristics. Lastly, we will
assess implementation via surveys in the intervention clinics (N=100) followed by interviews
(N=60) to explain variations in those outcomes. This project addresses National Institute on
Aging’s mission to improve care for older adults with AD/ADRD in primary care. This work will
improve how to incorporate ACP approaches for aging-related conditions by primary care teams
and may be adaptable to other outpatient specialties such as oncology or cardiology."
10932234,"Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) affects over 35 million people worldwide, and this number is expected to nearly triple
by 2050. AD is clinically characterized by progressive cognitive decline; pathologic AD is defined by amyloid
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Despite substantial effort, our understanding of its
pathophysiology remains incomplete. A thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms is a prerequisite
for discovering novel therapeutic targets. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are a specialized class of membrane lipids
composed of a ceramide backbone attached to one or more carbohydrates (i.e., glycans). GSLs are especially
abundant in the brain and play important roles in brain development, brain aging and neurodegeneration.
However, due to technical limitations, our knowledge about the global composition and structures of brain GSLs
and their associations with AD pathology remain limited. The mechanisms through which altered GSL expression
contributes to AD also remain an enigma. Recently, we have developed several novel technologies for identifying
and quantifying intact GSLs (both glycan and diverse lipid forms together as a whole), and for synthesis of GSLs
and their derivatives. We have also successfully validated these methods in both human and mouse brain tissue
samples. Using these innovative techniques, we will test the hypothesis that altered expression of brain GSLs
is causally implicated in AD pathology. Our objectives are to generate the first complete map of brain GSLome
(i.e., all GSLs in brain), to identify specific GSLs associated with AD neuropathology (e.g., amyloid-β,
neurofibrillary tangles), and to elucidate the mechanisms through which altered expression of GSLs causally
contributes to AD pathology. To achieve these goals, we leverage a large collection of human postmortem brain
tissue samples (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC) in two community-based cohorts of aging and dementia:
Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). Deep clinical and neuropathological
phenotypes as well as rich omics data (e.g., GWAS, DNA methylation, RNA-seq, proteomics) are already
available in both cohorts. In Aim 1, we will generate the first complete map of brain GSLome and identify specific
GSLs associated with AD neuropathology. Using a data-driven and system biology approach, Aim 2 will integrate
brain GSLome data with other brain omics data, including genomics (GWAS), epigenomics (DNA methylation,
histone acetylation, and miRNA), transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and proteomics in the same brain cortex (DLPFC),
to decipher the mechanisms through which altered brain GSLs causally contribute to AD pathology. Aim 3
employs a gene-centric approach to functionally validate the top-ranked genes in Drosophila model of AD. Such
results will provide novel mechanistic insight into AD pathology and would offer immense opportunities for
targeting the GSL pathways in developing novel therapeutics for AD treatment."
10740883,"The brain requires a continuous supply of nutrients and oxygen to fuel its normal functioning. Active areas of the
brain need more energy than relatively quiescent regions, so the blood supply to different areas of the brain is
dynamically varied over time to meet the ongoing needs of active neurons. Significant progress has been made
in understanding the essential role of localized synaptic glutamatergic signaling in regulating local cerebral blood
flow (CBF) in response to increased neuronal activity, a process known as neurovascular coupling (NVC).
However, little is currently known about the integration between neural (i.e., neurons and astrocytes) and
vascular networks and the broader mechanisms underlying the spatiotemporal coordination of local and global
vascular responses within the cortical angioarchitecture and among different brain regions. The overall goal of
this proposal is to identify interactions between local and global signaling pathways that control the magnitude
and distribution of blood to match metabolic demands. Our preliminary data show that the state of wakefulness
and engagement of the animal that are often associated with the release of long-range modulatory
neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin [5-HT]), and that manipulations of 5-HT activity modulate vascular responses.
We propose that glutamatergic and serotonergic signaling are integrated to control CBF. Our data further suggest
that vascular conduction may mediate ascending vasomotor responses from the deep layer to upstream
parenchyma and the surface of the cortex to coordinate blood flow. On the basis of these observations, we
propose a new paradigm in which activity-dependent allocation of CBF depends on the integration of three
elements: 1) local synaptic glutamatergic signaling, 2) the global serotonergic system, and 3) retrograde
intercellular conduction. We will employ two-photon fluorescence imaging of the vasculature and Ca2+ dynamics
in neurons and astrocytes in fully awake animals in conjunction with ex vivo preparations, knockout strategies,
genetically encoded biosensors, pharmacogenetics and optogenetics to test this paradigm. These integrated
approaches are novel and powerful as they give us the ability to fully explore the integration of different signaling
pathways under true physiological conditions without the need for anesthetics. Aim 1 will explore the contribution
of serotonergic signaling to sensory-induced increases in local CBF and to coordination of blood distribution
between inactive and active regions. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanisms underlying 5-HT–induced vasomotor
responses during whisker stimulation. Aim 3 will solidify the role of the endothelium in conducting electrical
signals from the subsurface microvascular network to the upstream parenchyma and surface of the cortex, a
process that is proposed to complement NVC. Our investigation into this novel model may reveal new
physiological processes essential to CBF regulation and ultimately provide insights that help maintain brain
health."
10804295,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Tic disorders including Tourette syndrome (TS) are very common, and often impair quality of life.
Many TS patients find symptoms improve over adolescence, but others do not. Very little
information is available to inform individual prognosis in TS, and existing studies cannot dissociate
behavioral or brain features preceding tics from those that may be caused by prolonged ticcing.
A unique data set allows us now to examine these questions prospectively in a large sample of
children not selected for the presence or absence of tics. Over 300 children participating in the
Preschool Depression Study (PDS), half with and half without some depressive symptoms in
preschool, had clinical assessments and behavioral tasks over a 15-year period, along with 5 waves of
MRI of the brain. Video recordings were made during and between various tasks at each of 8 visits
covering ages 3-19. Our preliminary data (expert review of video from 52 participants) shows that we
can detect tics from these recordings, and we calculate that almost half of the children in the PDS will
show tics at some visit in this study.
We will examine the video from each study visit to identify the presence and severity of any tics. We
will also invite all the study participants, now young adults age 21-25, to complete an online survey
regarding lifetime tics. We will use these data to identify clinical features prior to the onset of tics in
children who show tics on video at later visits (Aim 1a). Such a pre-tic follow-up study has never
been performed, and may identify novel tic-related clinical / behavioral features that, because they
precede tics, cannot be caused by ticcing. In children with tics, we will also identify clinical or MRI
features when children first manifest tics that predict outcome at later visits; we will validate these
results in extant data from two independent longitudinal studies of tics (Aim 1b). The results of
Aim 1 may prove clinically useful for prognosis, and may provide valuable new insights into
etiology, pathophysiology, and potentially secondary prevention of tic disorders.
A second aim will identify clinical and brain imaging factors that may relate to tic pathophysiology,
either (within subjects) by comparing changes over time in these factors as tic severity changes over
time, or (between groups) by comparing children with vs. those without tics, controlling for age.
This project will leverage existing data funded by NIMH, along with new identification of tics on
video from 2,000 study visits, in order to clarify pathophysiology and work towards scientifically-
based novel treatments. The investigators are experienced in TS research and child psychopathology,
and are ideally suited to bring this study to a successful conclusion."
10867421,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
People with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience restricted communicative participation [1,2], which means that
they have difficulty “taking part in life situations where knowledge, information, ideas or feelings are exchanged”
[3]. This restricted participation can have significant consequences for one's well-being, including social isolation,
loss of employment, deterioration of relationships, and difficulty accessing services [3,4]. We currently do not
have behavioral treatment targets that directly and effectively improve participation. The most basic form of
communicative participation is an interaction between two people, a dyad, engaged in dialogue. The small body
of research that has examined interaction behaviors (i.e., interdependent verbal behaviors) in people with PD
(and/or dysarthria) has used descriptive or case study designs to qualitatively describe the dialogues [5-11]. In
a prior R21, we extended this work, leveraging the existing rich literature on dialogue theory that was developed
with neurotypical (NT) adults, coupled with speech signal processing techniques and advanced statistical
modeling, to quantify interaction behaviors in task-controlled dialogue corpora [12-16]. Reasonable conclusions
from this collection of studies are that the interaction behaviors of PD-NT dyads are fundamentally different from
those of NT-NT dyads; and that these differences correlate to restricted participation in the dialogues of people
with PD. The next step is to move from these simple correlations to deriving causal, mechanistic relationships
between interaction behaviors and participation outcomes, allowing us to identify candidate treatment targets for
improving participation in people with PD. We will use two aims to do this. The first aim, using a between-within
design, will compare interaction behavior from the dialogues of PD-NT and NT-NT dyads and quantify their
variation across typical communicative situations. We will audio-record people with PD and NT controls (dyad
condition) engaged in a problem-solving and a rapport-building dialogue (goal condition) with a familiar and an
unfamiliar partner (partner condition). The resulting 480 dialogues will be annotated, and automated metrics of
interaction behaviors, including individual interaction behaviors of each person (articulatory precision, rhythmic
predictability, language complexity) and coordinative interaction behaviors (entrainment, conversational repair,
turn-taking), will be extracted. Linear mixed effects models will be used to assess these behaviors by dyad, goal,
and partner condition. Our second aim looks to assess the impact of each interaction behavior on communicative
participation outcomes in the dialogues of people with PD within a causal inference framework. Whereas SA1
compares the interaction behaviors across dyad types and communicative situations, SA2 uses the interaction
behaviors as input to a causal inference model. This will allow us to quantify how much each interaction behavior
contributed to the associated participation outcome for that dialogue and rigorously simulate the effects of
intervening on each interaction behavior. Assessment of the impact of each behavior will be done using Bayesian
multilevel modeling. Results will inform a subsequent hypothesis-driven clinical trial of interaction targets."
10893565,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains a major issue in the United States (US) despite the various laws, campaigns,
and preventative efforts. Alcohol is by far the most commonly-abused drug across the lifespan. According to
2015 data from The National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there are currently 138 million alcohol users in
the US, with almost half of drinkers reporting problem drinking (binge or heavy alcohol consumption), and 15.7
million reporting an AUD. A host of pharmaceutical targets have been identified, but treatment efficacy and
abstinence rates both remain low due to factors such as cost, negative physiological effects, and requirements
of long-term commitment to treatment. Thus, new directions for addiction treatment are needed. In one such
direction, recent advances in ultrasound technology have enabled the non-invasive modulation of deep brain
systems such as the reward circuit. We propose a novel combination of low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)
with photoacoustic tomography (PAT) localization to modify the activity of the two primary components of the
reward system, the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. Our preliminary work has demonstrated that
this approach reduces alcohol intake and preference when administered once daily in either region. Thus, in the
proposed studies, we will examine the mechanisms by which LIFU reduces alcohol intake, the longevity of this
effect, and potential side effects of this treatment on the brain. We will first optimize our protocol for maximum
efficacy in the deep brain regions of the reward circuit. Next, we will assess a variety of behaviors related to
affect and to alcohol-seeking in order to identify the neurological processes on which LIFU is exerting its effects.
Finally, we will assess the molecular effects in the brain following LIFU treatment, in order to identify those
neuronal changes that may explain the behavioral shifts, and to determine whether there are any adverse effects
on neuronal function following chronic LIFU treatment. For these studies, we will use male and female crossed
high-alcohol-preferring mice, in order to identify whether there are sex-dependent differences in the effects of
LIFU on alcohol-seeking, or in the neuronal effects of LIFU. These studies will provide an essential foundation
of knowledge for the use of LIFU to reduce AUD, and will open the door to a wide spectrum of further studies
examining other substance use disorders, and use of LIFU in traditionally difficult to treat populations, such as
adolescents, or for disorders commonly comorbid with AUD, such as sleep disorders."

Therapies targeting CD33 have long been pursued to improve outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Longer survival with the CD33 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-drug conjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO)
validates this approach. However, CD33 is a challenging target: several drugs have failed clinically, and benefit
with GO is restricted to AML patient subsets. As one possible shortcoming, almost all CD33-directed drugs,
including GO, recognize the membrane-distal V-set domain of CD33. As a basis for new therapies, the laboratory
of the Unit Director (Roland B. Walter, MD PhD MS) has raised new, fully human mAbs not only against the V-
set domain but also the membrane-proximal C2-set domain of CD33; the latter show enhanced effector cell
functions and target all naturally occurring CD33 variants (i.e., are “CD33PAN” mAbs). With these mAbs now
available, the Walter Lab will conduct well-controlled mechanistic in vitro and in vivo studies to optimize the
efficacy and safety of CD33-targeted therapy, with the explicit goal of patient application. We will primarily focus
our efforts on radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with the alpha particle emitting radioisotope astatine-211 (211At),
leveraging the exquisite radiosensitivity of AML cells, the high potency and target cell selectivity of 211At, and our
institutional infrastructure and expertise in bringing 211At-based RIT from the bench to the clinic. Because CD33
is also displayed on normal blood cells, CD33-targeted drugs cause significant “on-target, off-AML cell” toxicity,
most notably prolonged, profound myelosuppression. Therefore, in parallel to our work on maximizing the
efficacy of CD33-targeted therapy, we are also developing novel gene editing approaches to protect normal
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from these drugs to widen their therapeutic window and make their use
safer. The Research Specialist, George S. Laszlo, PhD, has been a member of the Walter Lab since its inception
in 2010. He has been responsible for the training, guidance, and supervision of all technicians as well as the
development and validation of all experimental methodologies, approaches, assays, and generation of all
tools/reagents that, together, built the foundation for the NCI-supported research program on optimizing CD33-
directed therapy as well as several other NIH-supported research projects that the Walter Lab is involved in. A
total of 22 peer-reviewed joint publications between Drs. Laszlo and Walter (9 with Dr. Laszlo as first author)
document their fruitful work relationship. Over the next 5 years, Dr. Laszlo will be essential for the conduct of our
studies described in this application, with key roles in the generation, production, purification, and
characterization of recombinant mAbs and derived therapeutics, the development of genetically engineered cell
line-based tools for drug testing, and the in vivo assessment of drug efficacies against human AML cells. With
his skills and expertise, Dr. Laszlo will be indispensable for our efforts to develop new, efficacious CD33-targeted
drugs in a stream-lined process for the benefit of patients with AML and other CD33+ disorders, for whom current
therapies are often ineffective."
10873255,"Project Summary/Abstract
Locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection continues to
be a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the US and globally. In particular, patients with evidence
of metastases to lymph nodes have a dismal 3-year overall survival of 39%, despite treatment with the
current standard of care of chemotherapy combined with radiation (CRT). There is thus a critical need
to develop new therapeutic strategies for patients with high-risk LACC. Combinations of CRT with
immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) drugs targeting PD-L1 (durvalumab) or PD-1 (pembrolizumab) are being
studied in global prospective trials CALLA and KEYNOTE A18, respectively. Unfortunately, the results of the
CALLA trial failed to demonstrate substantial improvement in 24-month survival with addition of durvalumab,
highlighting several critical knowledge gaps in combination of CRT and ICB in LACC. First, optimal sequencing
of CRT and ICB is unknown, and there are clear concerns that concurrent initiation of CRT and ICB carries a
potential to kill activated proliferating T cells in tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes, leading to tolerance.
Second, predictors of long-term outcomes for the patients treated with ICB and CRT are unknown. In this
application, our key study objectives are to examine the evolution of blood and tumor
microenvironment (TME) immune parameters in response to differential ICB-CRT sequencing and to
establish the predictors of long-term outcomes. To achieve these goals, we conducted and completed an
NCI-sponsored clinical trial of PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab in combination with CRT in patients with high-risk
LACC, randomizing patients to atezolizumab administration prior to and concurrent with CRT vs. concurrent
with CRT in 36 patients. The study incorporated comprehensive collection of pre- and on-treatment tumor
biopsies and blood and PET scans that will enable us to address the knowledge gaps above. In Aim 1 we will
determine how the tumor immune microenvironment evolves as a function of differential immunotherapy and
CRT sequencing. By using multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy, we will determine how activation of T
cells and their interaction with other cells in the tumors change in response to therapy and how these changes
predict long term outcomes. In Aim 2, we will take advantage of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing as
well as advanced bioinformatics techniques to evaluate how evolution of T cells in tumors and peripheral blood
could serve as an indicator of anti-tumor immune response and long-term outcomes. In Aim 3 we will establish
radiographic and blood biomarkers as predictors of outcomes in high-risk LACC patients by examining blood
HPV DNA and post-treatment PET-CT as markers of disease burden pre- and post-therapy. Identification of
early biomarkers predictive of outcomes will be critical for risk-stratification of patients with LACC in
order to guide patient selection for clinical trials or maintenance therapy, while minimizing the
potential clinical toxicities and financial burden in patients at low risk for recurrence."
10930126,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Globally, 1.34 billion people consume alcohol in harmful amounts, with alcohol use accounting for 1.78 million
deaths in 2020. Alcohol use often begins, and noticeably escalates, throughout adolescence. Incidence of
alcohol use disorder (AUD) and related symptomatology follows a similar pattern, peaking between the ages of
18 and 20 years. As such, AUD has been described as a “developmental disorder” of young adulthood. While
rates of problematic drinking are highest among young adults, recent years have seen large increases in
problematic drinking among older adults, with corresponding increases in AUD and alcohol-related
hospitalizations. The developmental processes contributing to alcohol use disorders (AUD) have long been
recognised but there remain substantial gaps in our knowledge about the neurobiological predictors of
“milestones” along the pathway to AUD, as well as the neurobiological consequences of alcohol use throughout
adolescence into midlife and older age. Our overarching aim is to therefore uncover the neurobiological
risks of adolescent alcohol use and distinguish these from the consequences of alcohol use in
adolescence and across the lifespan. This will be done within a developmental framework and conducted with
a focus on replicability and rigorous causal modelling. To address our aim, we need large-scale longitudinal
assessments of alcohol use, capturing the peak period of adolescent risk, and incorporating comprehensive
other substance use, behavioral, environmental, and imaging data. Data from the Adolescent Brain and
Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study therefore provide an unprecedented opportunity to address our aim. To
extend our examination of the consequences of alcohol use across the lifespan, we will combine (or harmonize)
ABCD data with large-scale, high quality cohort data from different life stages and jointly analyze these data to
establish the neurobiological predictors and consequences of alcohol use at key periods across the lifespan
within a unified framework. This project represents innovation in its: 1) developmental approach to the
relationship between alcohol use and neurobiology which focuses on adolescence but also extends across the
lifespan into older adulthood; 2) harmonization of data across four landmark datasets across the lifespan; 3)
methodological rigor focusing on the promotion of causal inference; 4) the application of neuroimaging and
biostatistical techniques that are unique to the research team; and (5) focus on replicability and the open science
framework, including preregistration of all analyses and publicly available code. Outcomes from this project will
have the potential to provide novel neurobiological targets for medication development, as well as alcohol
preventions and interventions informed by neuroscience. We will also take the first steps towards the
establishment of a larger international consortium of longitudinal cohort studies focused on the impact of alcohol
use on brain health across the lifespan."

Genetic research in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has led to the discovery of a growing list of highly
penetrant mutations in chromatin modifiers and transcription factors. This recent progress provides an
important opportunity to define the molecular mechanisms in ASD, as well as to identify targets for new
treatment strategies. However, given the large number of seemingly independent ASD risk factors, a major
challenge for ASD research is to establish convergent mechanisms that group apparently distinct genetic
etiologies. We identified a novel point of convergence between the histone-methyltransferase ASH1L, a major
ASD genetic risk factor, and a cluster of ASD high-risk genes (e.g. FOXP1, RIMS1, NRX1a). We also find that
ASH1L counteracts the activity of Polycomb repressor complex in neural development. Hence, our data
uncover a transcriptional and epigenetic node linked to cell and circuit dysfunction underlying ASD phenotypes.
However, the transcriptional programs modulated by ASH1L that lead to neuronal dysfunction are
understudied. Our central hypothesis is that ASH1L counteracts Polycomb activity to orchestrate
neuronal development by modulating transcriptional programs that control synaptic function and
neuronal morphogenesis. We will define how ASH1L regulates neuronal development and function. We will
use a multilevel, synergistic and translational approach that leverages human and mouse systems to
determine how ASH1L modulates neuronal programs relevant to ASD pathogenesis. We are positioned to
undertake this work, based on our robust preliminary data and combined expertise in cellular/molecular
neuroscience, bioinformatic, chromatin biology and electrophysiology. 1) Determine how mutations in ASH1L
disrupt neuronal arborization and function in human stem cell experimental systems, 2) Define functional and
circuit phenotypes associated with ASH1L in rodent systems. 3) Define bulk and cell type specific epigenetic
and transcriptional signatures associated with ASH1L mutations that cause disease in mouse and human
neurons. Finally, we will define rescue strategies for the cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological
phenotypes observed in both mouse and human experimental systems."
10726578,"Over 29 million Americans suffer from diabetes, including 25% of Veterans seeking VA healthcare. A strong
contributor to type 2 diabetes (T2D) is that obesity rates have increased dramatically in the last 3 decades, now
reaching over 30% in many parts of the country with rates over 40% in Veterans, who are disproportionally
affected by diabetes. In the United States, nearly 1 in 4 Veterans receiving care from the VA, and 20% of
Veterans overall have diabetes (compared to 9% in the general population). The prevalence of diabetes is even
higher in Veterans over the age of 65, and across all ages the prevalence of diabetes in Veterans is climbing by
2% every year. Developing new methods for properly treating the failure of insulin secretion in T2D patients is
therefore a high priority for the Veteran population. One molecule that is at the cornerstone of our research
program, the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK), has strong potential to be of protective and therapeutic
value. We have discovered that small-molecule PK activators control multiple cell types in the pancreatic islet
and enhance insulin secretion, including in human islets from obese and T2D donors. The objective of this
proposal is to identify the mechanisms by which PK activation is able to enhance insulin secretion at the cellular
and molecular level. Based on our preliminary studies, our central hypothesis is that PK controls both α- and β-
cell hormone secretion by closing ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP). The physiological model being tested is that
islet α-cells, which are activated by amino acids, supercharge β-cell secretion to lower postprandial blood
glucose. We will test our central hypothesis in multiple pre-clinical models of diabetes, and accomplish the
objective of this proposal by completing the following specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of PK activation on
α-cell metabolism and hormone secretion, 2) Determine how α-cell hormones enhance the β-cell response to
PK activators, and 3) Assess the therapeutic potential of combining PK activators with Glp1 receptor agonists to
prevent and rescue obesity/T2D. With the completion of these aims, we will gain a significantly more
comprehensive understanding of PK function in the pancreatic islet, and take the critical next steps in evaluating
PK as a new target for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes."
10886118,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer cells are the organizers of their surroundings and create a tumor microenvironment (TME) favoring cell
division even when oxygen and nutrients are limiting. An extreme example is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) which establishes a metabolically hostile ecosystem characterized by a hypo-vascular, severely hypoxic,
and nutrient deprived stroma. Clinical trials targeting components of the PDAC stroma have not improved overall
survival in unselected cohorts. Thus, while opportunities for targeting the PDAC TME exist, the development of
anti-stromal therapies will require a better understanding of inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity.
Our labs have studied two features of the PDAC stroma: the vasculature and CAFs. By analyzing multiple human
datasets, and mouse models, we found that a significant portion of human PDACs (~10%) are hyper-vascular.
In murine models, hyper-vascularity is associated with increased sensitivity to angiogenesis inhibitors. In
addition, our preliminary studies have shown that in the more typical hypo-vascular tumors, hypoxia renders
PDAC tumor cells incapable of synthesizing unsaturated fatty acids (uFAs), and therefore critically dependent
upon lipids supplied by neighboring CAFs for their survival. Based on these data, we hypothesize that cancer-
associated micro-vasculature and lipid secreting fibroblasts represent under-exploited, clinically relevant targets
within the PDAC stroma.
Here, we propose an innovative approach to delineate the cellular mechanisms by which tumor cells build and
maintain critical metabolic “supply chains” and how regional differences within tumors influence nutrient
utilization and vascular intravasation. Our proposal addresses both basic and translational questions and utilizes
human tissue resources, implantable and genetically engineered mouse models, platforms to assess stromal
geography and metabolic features, and cancer-on-chip techniques for ex vivo modeling. Our ultimate goal is to
understand and manipulate the major sources from which PDAC cells derive essential nutrients (especially vital
uFAs) – focusing on micro-vessels and fibroblasts.
Aim 1. Determine the causes and consequences of vascular heterogeneity in PDAC
Aim 2. Delineate molecular mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities underlying stromal support of
lipid metabolism in PDAC"

 Genital herpes affects 650 million people globally. Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent infection and treat
individuals already infected. During the current funding cycle, we developed a candidate vaccine for preventing
genital herpes that uses nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated within lipid nanoparticles (LNP) to express
herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) glycoproteins C, D, and E (gC2, gD2, gE2). The vaccine targets an entry
molecule, gD2, and two immune evasion molecules, gC2 and gE2. Our vaccine candidate will enter phase 1
human trials in December 2022. Our new goals are to define the immune correlates of protection for the
trivalent vaccine using sera we collected from immunized mice and guinea pigs during this grant cycle, and to
develop an mRNA-based vaccine as immunotherapy.
 In Aim 1, we will define the immune correlates of protection. Our hypothesis is that by defining immune
correlates, we will better understand the mechanisms of vaccine protection and the immune responses required
for success in human trials. We will use high throughput biosensor technology and our extensive panel of gC2,
gD2, and gE2 monoclonal antibodies to determine whether the trivalent vaccine produces antibodies to crucial
epitopes on gC2, gD2 and gE2. The epitopes of interest include those on gC2 that bind complement component
C3b to inhibit complement activation, gE2 that bind the IgG Fc domain to block Fc-mediated activities including
complement activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and gD2 that bind to cell receptors for virus
entry and mediate cell-to-cell spread. We will correlate antibody binding to these important epitopes with
protection against clinical outcomes including genital lesions and latent infection. The epitope mapping studies
will enable us to assess the contribution of each of the glycoprotein immunogens to protection.
 Aim 2 uses mRNA immunogens to develop a genital herpes therapeutic vaccine. We hypothesize that T cell
responses will be particularly important for a successful therapeutic vaccine. In Preliminary studies, we infected
guinea pigs intravaginally with HSV-2 and once recovered, we immunized with glycoproteins E and I (gE2/gI2)
mRNA-LNP. gE2/gI2 mRNA-LNP reduced the number of days with recurrent genital lesions by 47%, an excellent
start towards our primary endpoint of >70% reduction in recurrent genital lesions. To achieve our goal of >70%,
we will incorporate other antigens, including additional glycoproteins, immediate early, capsid and tegument
immunogens and assess CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in male and female mice. We will advance the best
candidates for efficacy studies in guinea pigs. We will focus initially on glycoprotein immunogens because of the
remarkable success of a therapeutic vaccine for a closely related virus, varicella zoster virus, that uses
glycoprotein E as the antigen. We will include the trivalent gC2/gD2/gE2 vaccine in the therapeutic studies to
determine whether one vaccine formulation will be effective for prevention and treatment. If successful, the
studies in Aims 1 and 2 will have a positive impact on billions of people by preventing and treating genital herpes."
10890175,"This project catalyzes research on brain networks by developing computational methods and
software tools for analysis of diffusion MRI (dMRI) data and validating them in vivo.
Understanding brain networks and their relation to neural computation is a major challenge in
contemporary neuroscience. The proper function of brain networks is also inextricably tied to
neurological, cognitive and psychiatric health. The networks that connect distinct regions in the
brain are composed of large bundles that contain the axons of millions of neurons. DMRI is the
only currently available method to measure the trajectory and physical properties of these
bundles in the human brain non-invasively and a large body of research using dMRI has
substantially contributed to our understanding of the way in which differences in brain
connections contribute to individual differences across a spectrum of behaviors and clinical
conditions. Progress in research and methods development has also translated into increasing
use of dMRI in clinical applications. The project is led by the founders of the Diffusion Imaging in
Python (DIPY) software project who have been working to invigorate the neuroimaging user and
developer community by developing, implementing, disseminating, and maintaining important
software tools. The proposed project pursues a next generation phase of development, in which
the overall objective is to generate a platform to better utilize dMRI data in accordance with
BRAIN 2.0 targets. To address current barriers to progress, we plan to address the following
aims in the current proposal: Aim 1 will develop new tractometry methods that enhance the
interpretability of dMRI data; Aim 2 will introduce new pre-processing algorithms including
methods for susceptibility correction; Aim 3 will focus on improving computational performance
using parallel computing within a single node (e.g., via use of graphical processing units) and

using publicly available human and non-human primate data. Overall, this work will enable
impactful brain research and will facilitate subsequent clinical adoption of advanced
computational methods using dMRI data."

The fat-soluble vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) is distributed in the body to maintain retinoid signaling
in peripheral tissues and vision in the eyes. This transport occurs via an extrinsic pathway for the
distribution of dietary vitamin A in the form of retinyl esters in chylomicrons and an intrinsic
pathway for the distribution of vitamin A from hepatic stores bound to the retinoid binding protein
RBP4. Cellular uptake of vitamin A from these two transport modes is facilitated by lipoprotein
lipase and by the RBP4 receptor STRA6 (Stimulated by Retinoic Acid 6), respectively. Disrupted
vitamin A transport is a serious health problem and is associated with blinding diseases ranging
from night blindness to complex ophthalmic syndromes. We propose to study the etiology of
ocular diseases states that are associated with perturbed ocular vitamin A uptake homeostasis
by comparing the eyes of STRA6-deficient and that of control mice.
In Aim 1, we will examine the role of STRA6 in the functioning of the outer blood-retinal barrier.
We will study whether ocular vitamin A deficiency in Stra6 knockout mice impairs the structural
integrity and functioning of this barrier. Additionally, we will examine whether retinoid signaling
regulates the expression of key components of both the outer blood-retina barrier in mice and
human retina pigment epithelium cells derived from inducible pluripotent stem cells. In Aim 2, we
will use Stra6 knockout mice to analyze the consequences of imbalances in ocular retinoid
concentrations on rod and cone photoreceptor function and ultrastructure. We will generate novel
transgenic mouse lines to examine the competition between rods and cones for limited
chromophore in the STRA6-deficient eyes. This research will address the question whether the
STRA6/RBP4-dependent transport system is an adaption to the high chromophore demand from
rod photoreceptors. In Aim 3, we will study whether manipulation of the extrinsic pathway can
rescue cone and rod photoreceptor function in STRA6-deficiency and whether the STRA6/RBP4
uptake system provides selectivity for the uptake of canonical retinoids. Collectively, our proposed
studies will advance knowledge about ocular vitamin A homeostasis by elucidating its
mechanisms in the physiological state and by studying the consequences of its loss-of-function
in disease states."
10885200,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite significant advances in cancer care, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains the third leading
cause of cancer death in the United States with a 5-year survival rate of ~10%. Obesity and high fat diet (HFD)
consumption increase PDAC risk in human cohorts and accelerate PDAC progression in mice, but the
mechanistic basis for these relationships is not well understood. Given the rapid rise in both the worldwide
prevalence of obesity and consumption of dietary fat, deciphering mechanisms of obesity-driven PDAC could
broadly impact human health. The translational relevance of prior diet research, however, has been limited by
uncontrolled variations in fat source and intake across human populations and mouse experiments. Therefore,
whether and how specific dietary fats promote pancreatic tumorigenesis remain critical unanswered questions
of great societal importance. Leveraging a unique isocaloric panel of HFDs differing only in fat source, we
identified a correlation between consumption of diets high in oleic acid – a monounsaturated fatty acid typically
associated with good health – and enhanced tumor development in a genetic model of PDAC that faithfully
mimics the genetic and histologic progression of the human disease. We further observed that tumorigenesis
correlated with increased incorporation of oleic acid into specific phospholipids in tissues, including the pancreas.
In this proposal, we aim to test the hypothesis that excess dietary oleic acid directly incorporates into cellular
lipids in the pancreas to drive PDAC development. The studies in Aim 1 utilize sophisticated genetic,
pharmacologic, and dietary approaches to modulate systemic oleic acid levels and establish whether excess
oleic acid is necessary and sufficient to promote pancreatic tumorigenesis. The proposed work in Aim 2 uses
lipidomic analyses to clarify the relationship between dietary fatty acids and pancreatic lipid composition during
PDAC progression and tests whether specific resultant unsaturated lysophospholipids drive tumorigenesis.
Finally, the experiments in Aim 3 combine metabolic and radioactive isotope tracer analyses with conditional
knockout models to decipher the mechanisms by which dietary oleic acid is directly taken up by the pancreas
and whether inhibition of fatty acid uptake pathways in pancreatic cells blocks the pro-tumorigenic effects of oleic
acid. Together, these studies will link fatty acid consumption to specific changes in pancreatic lipid composition
as driving forces in PDAC progression. Results from this work have transformative potential to identify novel
targeted dietary and pharmacologic strategies for the prevention of a largely incurable cancer."
10912011,"Chromatin conformation underlies accessibility of enzymes that participate in transcription, replication,
recombination, and repair. Many chromatin-regulatory mechanisms ensure that enzymes such as RNA
polymerase II gain access to and efficiently transcribe chromatin. One of the mechanisms of chromatin regulation
is based on the posttranslational modification of histones. Chemical groups are deposited, read and removed by
specific families of enzymes to regulate chromatin structure. These modifications rarely function in isolation, and
there is often crosstalk between them that results in a coordinated transcriptional output. One of the prime
examples of such crosstalk is seen in transcription elongation, in which histones H3 and H4 are acetylated, H2B
is ubiquitinated, and histone H3 is methylated at lysine 4 and 79 (H3K4 and H3K79). COMPASS/MLL and Dot1
are the enzymes that catalyze methylation of H3K4 and H3K79 respectively and are evolutionarily conserved.
They play essential roles in processes such as transcription elongation, cell cycle control, and DNA repair.
Homologs are found, among others, in yeast, and mammals. Deregulation of Dot1L and MLL1, has been found
in several cancers, especially in leukemias, and Dot1L and MLL1 inhibition has emerged as a promising
therapeutic strategy. Trypanosome Dot1 is involved in evasion of the human immune system contributing to
devastating diseases such as African sleeping sickness. Understanding the mechanisms underlying Dot1 and
COMPASS/MLL1 functions is critical to discovery of novel strategies to fight diseases associated with their
deregulation. This proposal centers on finding and characterizing novel mechanisms of Dot1 and
COMPASS/MLL1 regulation. We will use biochemical, biophysical and structural methods to study these histone
methyltransferases. We will validate our mechanistic hypotheses in cells and in vivo. Using this integrative
structural and functional approach and different model systems will allow us to determine evolutionarily
conserved and organism-specific biological functions and modes of regulation of Dot1 and COMPASS/MLL1
which can be applied to therapeutic strategies for a variety of diseases."

 Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD) is a major cause of vision loss and a leading indication for
corneal transplantation. A healthy corneal endothelial cell layer pumps fluid out of the corneal stroma to maintain
the optimal hydration state for corneal transparency. Late-onset FECD is caused by loss of endothelial function
and is linked to dominant inheritance of mutations in several genes including SLC4A11. SLC4A11 encodes an
endothelial H+ transporter. The development of non-invasive therapies for older individuals to prevent or delay
FECD onset would obviate the need for transplants. However, therapeutic advances have been hindered by a
lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie onset of this complex disease and a lack of
suitable and diverse animal models for developing and testing therapies. To address both issues, a transgenic
mouse-line has been generated that carries the dominant human FECD mutant Trp240Ser (W240S) in its
SLC4A11 gene. W240S heterozygous mice develop edema and signs of reduced antioxidant capacity, but not
diagnostic guttae. The hypothesis of this study is that these mice are more susceptible to oxidative stress and
will model FECD upon UVA-light exposure. There are two aims [1] Examine the molecular consequences of the
W240S mutation on endothelial health. [2] Examine the link between SLC4A11 mutation and phenotype. The
proposed research is both significant and innovative because it the first genetic mouse model that recreate signs
of late-onset FECD and uses novel tools and a multidisciplinary approach that will inform the development of
new early-diagnostic, risk-scoring, and therapeutic approaches for FECD."
10906221,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 1 million people in the United States suffer a myocardial infarction (MI) each year, leading to
progressive cardiac dysfunction and development of heart failure (HF) in ~25% of surviving patients. Diabetes
mellitus is a major risk factor for MI, and patients with diabetes suffer from higher mortality rates and increased
risk of developing HF. Due to the limited success of current therapies in preventing adverse cardiac remodeling
after MI, novel therapeutic targets are needed to effectively promote adequate healing and limit tissue damage,
especially in diabetic patients. Excessive macrophage-mediated inflammation is a key mechanism leading to
adverse cardiac remodeling after MI, and patients with diabetes display exacerbated and persistent post-MI
inflammatory responses. A key mechanism by which macrophages polarize between the pro-inflammatory “M1”
and anti-inflammatory/pro-reparative “M2” subsets is via metabolic reprogramming characterized by phenotypic
switches between glycolytic metabolism, which promotes M1 polarization, and mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which promotes M2 polarization. Using Seahorse metabolic flux analysis, I have
found that during the early inflammatory phase (day 1 and 3 after MI in mice), infarct macrophages become
glycolytic, whereas during the healing phase (day 7), macrophages revert to glucose oxidation and OXPHOS. In
addition to glucose, macrophages can metabolize “alternative” fuels, including lactate and ketone bodies, which
promote an M2 phenotype. However, the role of lactate and ketone body metabolism by macrophages during
MI is unknown, and whether administration or endogenous production of these compounds can promote M2
macrophage polarization during MI is also not known. My preliminary data indicate that expression of genes
related to lactate (Mct1, Ldhb) and ketone (Oxct1) metabolism are upregulated in macrophage during the wound
healing phase of MI. Further preliminary data indicates that in vivo administration of lactate or ketones, or feeding
a ketogenic diet attenuates the macrophage immunometabolic phenotype after MI. This indicates that
metabolism of these substrates may underlie M2 polarization and cardiac healing after MI. Thus, the hypothesis
for this proposal is that elevated endogenous production or exogenous administration of lactate and
ketones will improve cardiac remodeling and reduces cardiac injury after MI via improved macrophage
metabolism and polarization. I also propose that diabetes exacerbates MI injury via impaired
macrophage lactate and ketone metabolism. To address these hypotheses, I will use clinically relevant mouse
models of MI and diabetes mellitus, and macrophage-specific genetically modified mice, coupled with state-of-
the-art techniques for measuring cardiac function (high resolution ultrasound echocardiography and 4D imaging),
live cellular metabolism, macrophage isolation by immunomagnetic sorting, and flow cytometry. These studies
will provide new mechanisms of lactate and ketone-mediated cardioprotection, and novel strategies for targeting
macrophage metabolism following cardiac injury."
10851831,"Abstract. This is an ancillary study to SOURCE (SPIROMICS Study of Early COPD Progression, NHLBI
HL144718), an observational study of the early manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). Based on the knowledge that the small airway epithelium (SAE) is the earliest site of the
pathology of COPD, the focus of this ancillary proposal is to characterize the disordered SAE
differentiation in SOURCE participants and correlate this biologic dysfunction with the abnormal
early COPD small airway clinical phenotypes characterized in SOURCE. We will capitalize on the
availability of resources from SOURCE for use in our study, including: detailed clinical phenotyping of
small airway structure and function, with serum, lavage fluid, SAE cytopreps, SAE RNA, and SAE basal
stem/progenitor cells obtained by bronchoscopy from n=80 individuals with early COPD ages 30-55, and
n=20 normal controls. As an additional control, we will provide parallel clinical data and biologic samples
from our BioBank n=10 healthy smokers. Based on our observations that in early COPD, SAE basal
stem/progenitor cells have a decreased capacity to form a normal differentiated SAE, preliminary data
demonstrating that BMP4 and SPDEF are upregulated in the SAE in early COPD smokers and that BMP4
induces squamous metaplasia and SPDEF induces goblet cell hyperplasia, the proposed studies will
characterize the role of BMP4 and SPDEF in the pathogenesis of the disordered small airway
differentiation in early COPD. We hypothesize that early COPD is characterized, in part, by SAE
upregulation of BMP4 and SPDEF which, in turn, contribute to the clinical abnormalities of the
small airways that characterize early COPD. The results will help determine if BMP4 and SPDEF and/or
their driver genes and/or downstream signaling pathways are potential targets for future therapeutic
intervention to reverse/prevent the small airway abnormalities that characterize early COPD. We propose
3 specific aims. Aim 1: To characterize the disordered SAE in early COPD and evaluate the hypothesis
that SAE basal cells (BC) from individuals with early COPD have a reduced capacity to differentiate into a
normal SAE as assessed in vitro using air-liquid interface cultures. Aim 2: To examine the hypothesis that
the disordered SAE BC differentiation in early COPD is caused, in part, by SAE overexpression of BMP4
and SPDEF, resulting in activation of their respective receptor downstream signaling pathways and
consequent abnormal SAE differentiation of squamous metaplasia and goblet cell hyperplasia. Aim 3: To
test the hypothesis that diminished small airway epithelial BC differentiation and BMP4- and SPDEF-
mediated biologic parameters correlate with the clinical parameters of small airway structure and function
in the same SOURCE participants with early COPD."
10894272,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term objectives of this proposal are to elucidate heme signaling networks that regulate the metabolic
adaption to aging and control lifespan. The canonical function of heme in cell biology is as a protein cofactor.
More recent studies indicate that heme may act as a dynamic signaling molecule. Previous studies have
shown that there is a decline in heme concentration in several cell and animal models of aging, and this
decline is associated with various hallmarks of aging, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and
diminished lifespan. In our recent unpublished studies, we found that limiting cellular heme dramatically
increases lifespan in cell (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and animal (Caenorhabditis elegans) models of aging.
However, the mechanisms by which heme regulates lifespan are not known. The current proposal integrates
genetically encoded heme sensors, heme chelators, mass spectrometry approaches, and molecular genetics,
to probe the role of heme in aging and the mechanisms it acts through to control lifespan. In particular, we
seek to identify the targets of heme signaling that control lifespan, the mechanisms that mediate inter-organelle
and inter-organ heme transfer to regulate lifespan, and the subcellular and tissue/organ locations where heme
signaling operates to respond to aging and control lifespan.
Two specific aims are proposed in which the role of heme in cellular and animal aging will be probed in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a cell model, (Aim 1) and in Caenorhabditis elegans, an animal model (Aim 2). In
Aim 1, to elucidate the mechanisms of inter-organelle heme signaling in a yeast cell model of aging, we will (a)
identify the targets of heme signaling using complementary genetic and hemoproteomics approaches, (b)
determine the subcellular location where heme is sourced for heme signaling, and elucidate inter-organellar
heme trafficking pathways using gene-deletion and proteomics screens. In Aim 2, to elucidate the mechanisms
of inter-organ heme signaling in a worm animal model of aging, we will (a) determine the role of heme and
heme responsive genes (hrgs) in modifying lifespan in long-lived [daf-2] and short-lived [daf-16] worm mutants,
(b) identify the sender and receiver cells of heme signaling in control of lifespan using tissue-restricted
genetically encoded heme sensors in long-lived and short-lived mutants, (c) assess organ and subcellular
labile heme pools that control lifespan, and deploy hemoproteomics to identify novel targets of heme signaling
that could control lifespan and assess the impact of these candidate interactors on heme signaling
The current proposal will be the first to comprehensively decipher the role of heme in aging and may lead to
new heme-based therapeutic interventions that can be used to slow aging or treat age associated diseases."

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of signaling receptors in animals, and as such,
they represent an important class of therapeutic targets. Following ligand binding and G protein activation at the
plasma membrane, GPCRs undergo regulated endocytosis and sorting for recycling or degradation. Traditionally,
studies of ligand-dependent GPCR signaling have focused on receptor-G protein coupling at the plasma
membrane (PM). However, it is now clear that GPCRs can continue to signal from internal membrane locations
and that the downstream responses elicited from intracellular signaling are distinct from those elicited from PM
signaling. While the biochemistry of GPCR activation has been studied in detail, the organization and regulation
of GPCR signaling in living cells remains an underexplored frontier. The proposed studies will investigate
fundamental mechanisms underpinning spatiotemporal regulation of GPCR signaling and will provide key
training to enable Dr. Blythe to become an independent leader in this emerging area of molecular and cellular
physiology. The mentored phase of this project will be carried out at the University of California, San Francisco
under the primary mentorship of Dr. Mark von Zastrow, a leader in the field of GPCR trafficking and signaling.
The long-term goals of this work are to understand (1) how the subcellular localization of GPCRs and their
associated proteins change in response to signaling and (2) how this cellular reorganization regulates their
distinct downstream responses. The first two Aims will focus on receptor trafficking and signaling, defining the
mechanisms by which unique endocytic (Aim 1) and recycling (Aim 2) pathways sculpt signaling by
endogenously expressed GPCRs in a HEK293 cell model. In carrying out these experiments, Dr. Blythe will gain
new experience in advanced imaging techniques, as well as in integral membrane protein biochemistry with the
help of Dr. Aashish Manglik (collaborator). Aim 3 frames the biology in a broader perspective by asking how the
dynamic subcellular localization of other proteins contributes to the spatiotemporal regulation of GPCR signaling.
Using a novel proximity labeling approach under the mentorship of Dr. Nevan Krogan (co-Mentor) and Dr. Ruth
Hüttenhain (collaborator), Dr. Blythe will map the changes in the proteomes of specific cellular compartments
during the activation of the same model GPCRs and explore how these changes dictate signaling. The proposed
work will enable a systems-level analysis of GPCR signaling that was not feasible with current approaches and
provide an invaluable training opportunity for Dr. Blythe in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. In summary,
this project will take advantage of the expertise of a diverse mentorship team and the world-class resources and
facilities at UCSF to tackle fundamental questions in GPCR biology."

In proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the human brain, signals arise both upfield (UF) and
downfield (DF) from the water resonance. While UF MRS and MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) have been
extensively studied in humans over the last 30 years, there have been very few downfield studies, and all of
them used single voxel spatial localization. Recently, our group developed the first single slice approach for in
vivo DF-MRSI at 3T5. Subsequently, I have further implemented the first three-dimensional (3D) DF-MRSI
methods in the human brain with whole brain coverage, on both clinical high-field (3T) and research ultra-high-
field (7T) MR systems.
 Currently, there are two significant technical challenges for DF-MRSI, namely (a) the lack of pulse sequences
to acquire 3D DF-MRSI with optimum sensitivity in the shortest possible scan time, and (b) specific software for
the accurate quantification and visualization of the broad and significantly overlapping DF signals. In addition,
the clinical and neuroscience applications of DF-MRSI have yet to be explored. To address these issues, I
propose to develop optimized 3D DF-MRSI pulse sequences for both 3T and 7T, and also to develop an open-
source software package for improved quantification, analysis, and visualization of DF resonances. DF spectra
contain signals from both exchangeable and non-exchangeable protons, and the information content of DF-
MRSI may therefore be complementary to chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI. In particular,
amide-proton transfer (APT) CEST has proven quite successful for the evaluation of human brain tumors; in
the R00 phase of this proposal, after establishing normative values and reproducibility, a comparison of the
value of 3D DF-MRSI vs. APT-CEST in patients with glioma will be performed. In particular, I will focus on the
ability to distinguish recurrent tumor from radiation necrosis in patients treated for high grade glioma; this is an
important diagnostic question that directly effects choice of treatment, and which is often difficult to answer
using conventional MRI.
 Developing these novel techniques requires substantial expertise both in MRSI sequence development and
in data analysis. This proposal builds upon my unique record in biomedical imaging with new training from a
mentoring team of globally recognized experts in the fields of MRSI, clinical multimodal spectroscopic imaging,
and development of post-processing and analysis software at the Johns Hopkins University with outstanding
career development resources to successfully train me during this Pathway to Independence Award. This
project will generate novel tools to study metabolic processes in neurological and neuropathological processes
and leverage their potential to advance the understanding of brain tumors, potentially indicating new routes
toward improved diagnosis and efficient therapy strategies."
10915034,"As a result of efforts to reduce healthcare costs and improve quality, patients with heart failure are increasingly
receiving treatment in community-based programs, such as managed long-term care programs which support
older adults in remaining independent in their community. Managed long-term care aims to reduce unplanned
hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, but heart failure is still the leading reason for these
avoidable events. In managed long-term care, the care coordinator (i.e., a registered nurse or social worker)
maintains regular contact with patients by telephone to ensure that they receive care congruent with their
medical needs. From the linguistic perspective, verbal communications between patients and healthcare
providers are information-seeking and sharing behaviors, as they include problem-focused communication.
From the acoustic perspective, heart failure can affect patients’ voice and speech characteristics due to
swelling caused by fluid retention or compression of the laryngeal nerve due to enlarged heart structures.
While verbal communication between patients with heart failure and their care coordinators can provide insight
into hospitalization and ED risks, it is largely untapped in managed long-term care. To address this gap, we
aim to examine whether audio-recorded verbal telephone communication (hereafter called verbal
communication) can be utilized to improve risk prediction. In the K99 phase, we will focus on identifying
information in verbal communications between patients with heart failure and their care coordinators. We will
extract the following potential risk factors for hospitalizations or ED visits from verbal communications: (1)
conversational characteristics to analyze interactions in patterns of communication, (2) language phenotypes
based on a list of the language of risk factors, including heart failure symptoms, poor self-management, and
other hospitalization risks, and (3) acoustic features by analyzing voice signals. In the R00 phase, we will focus
on developing risk prediction models for hospitalizations or ED visits for patients with heart failure in managed
long-term care. We will develop several machine learning-based risk prediction models for hospitalizations or
ED visits using information derived from: a) structured electronic health records, b) care coordination notes,
and c) verbal communications between patients with heart failure and their care coordinators (identified during
the K99 phase). We will evaluate if the risk prediction performance of machine learning algorithms can be
improved by integrating information from different data sources. This proposal is aligned with the Strategic
Vision key area of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), ""Leverage emerging opportunities in
data science to open new frontiers in heart, lung, blood, and sleep research."" This study will be an important
step toward achieving my long-term career goal of developing risk prediction models for heart failure patients
and implementing them into clinical decision support systems. In particular, the goal is to identify early signs of
deterioration by incorporating verbal communication from patients into risk models."

national multisite cohorts with an emphasis on racial diversity, scientific rigor, and innovative approaches to
improve health disparities. We suggest an approach and methods for consideration for the common protocol
during the UG3 period, with full appreciation for the balance of decisions that will need to be made to ensure
efficient recruitment, comprehensive yet not burdensome surveys, thoughtful clinical protocols that can be
implemented in a community or in-home setting, and high-quality biospecimens processed and banked to
support scientific investigation and ancillary studies. We plan to hire bilingual, bicultural individuals from the
Asian community and train them to work as “community ambassadors (CAs)” during the entire study period, a
model that has proven highly effective in Asian communities previously, promoting both participation and
retention. We have an institutional commitment to deploy mobile medical units (MMUs) and study vans to
targeted study areas at no cost to the grant to ensure that we can lower barriers to participation. We are
confident that our proposed approach will allow us to meet the cohort UG3 and UH3 milestones, short-, mid-
and long-term goals, and contribute significantly to this important effort in all phases."
10877184,"Project Summary
Pyroptosis is a programmed process of lytic, pro-inflammatory cell death that is involved in the pathogenesis of
leading global causes of mortality. Inflammasome-mediated innate immune signaling activates caspase-1
family proteases to initiate pyroptosis by cleaving the pore-forming protein, gasdermin D. Recent data
demonstrate that the protein ninjurin-1 oligomerizes during pyroptosis and is required for plasma membrane
rupture, or cell lysis, downstream of gasdermin D pore formation. Cellular factors released during pyroptotic
lysis cause local and systemic inflammation and pathology, but processes that regulate plasma membrane
rupture and whether these can be therapeutically targeted, are not well-understood. We recently identified
muscimol as a novel inhibitor of pyroptotic lysis, but its mechanism of action is not yet known. Muscimol is
well-studied as an agonist of neuronal GABA receptors, but our preliminary data suggest that inhibition of
pyroptotic lysis is not mediated by these receptors. This proposal aims to understand how muscimol prevents
pyroptotic lysis and identify muscimol analogs with potent and specific activity.
The experiments outlined in this proposal will systematically examine steps in the process of pyroptosis for
inhibition by muscimol. Based on preliminary data, we will focus experiments on the hypothesis that muscimol
interferes with ninjurin-1 oligomerization, while also testing other possibilities. We will use complementary
models of pyroptosis induced by inflammasome-dependent and -independent stimuli, and further employ
reductionist systems based on our findings. Our preliminary data suggest that there are specific molecular
determinants for muscimol inhibition of pyroptotic lysis, as analogs demonstrate varied potency from the parent
molecule, not correlating with GABA receptor activity. We will systematically test a panel of rationally-selected,
already synthesized, muscimol analogs for inhibition of pyroptotic lysis. We hypothesize that our results will
reveal a novel structure-activity relationship for muscimol inhibition of plasma membrane rupture compared to
its canonical activity at neuronal receptors. In addition, these experiments may yield analogs with increased
potency and / or specific activity to prevent pyroptotic lysis, without activity at GABA receptors. Finally, we will
utilize the unique chemical properties of muscimol, coupled with advances in proteomics and the expertise of
our collaborators, to identify novel muscimol-binding proteins. Together, the results of these experiments will
inform a precise molecular understanding of the mechanism of action to disrupt pyroptotic lysis and provide the
foundation for a novel therapeutic strategy for the many diseases in which pyroptosis has been implicated."
10917267,"TITLE: Pulmonary Rehabilitation as a Senolytic Intervention to Reduce Exacerbations in COPD
(PERSPIRE-COPD)
PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are responsible for over
250,000 hospitalizations per year in older American adults (age ≥ 65). Current therapies are ineffective at
preventing AECOPD resulting in an urgent and unmet need to develop more effective treatments. A major barrier
to progress is identification of a modifiable biologic target. Among currently available treatments, pulmonary
rehabilitation (PR) is safe and effective at preventing AECOPD in older adults. However, the biological
mechanisms responsible for AECOPD prevention are not well understood. To address this gap in knowledge,
we will leverage PR as a model to identify modifiable biologic targets to prevent AECOPD. Our findings will allow
further PR optimization and provide biologic targets for future therapeutic drug development.
 Host immunity likely plays an important role in AECOPD prevention as a majority of events are caused
by respiratory viral infections. Considering this, I propose that age-related decline in immune system function
(i.e. immunosenescence) predisposes patients to higher AECOPD risk. Greater immunosenescence leads to
more AECOPD events. Immunosenescence is characterized by high levels of senescent T-cells and senescence
associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Therapies that eliminate senescent cells (i.e. senolytics) could
potentially lower AECOPD risk. Exercise interventions have been shown to remove senescent T-cells and
increase naïve T-cell proliferation. Considering PR is an exercise training intervention. I hypothesize that PR
reduces the relative frequency of senescent T-cells to naïve T-cells and SASP levels. These changes will
increase resilience to respiratory infections, lower AECOPD risk, and accelerate recovery from AECOPD. In
preparation for future investigations into AECOPD risk, we will test the hypothesis that PR is associated with a
decrease in relative frequency of senescent to naïve T-cells and SASP levels and determine the correlation of
these changes with an improvement in physical performance and HRQoL. To begin to address this line of
investigation, I’ve developed a PR biorepository that contains biospecimens collected at standardized intervals
and pre/post-PR measurements of physical performance and HRQoL.
 Completion of these aims will support my professional development towards a career as a translational
scientist with a focus in aging biology and clinical trials in older adults with COPD. The GEMSSTAR will deepen
my knowledge of SASP biomarkers, T-cell immunology, immunosenescence, and within-subjects methodology
and foster collaborations within the geriatrics research community. The project will result in 3 published
manuscripts, 2 presentations at national conferences, and preliminary data towards a subsequent K76 Paul B.
Beeson Career Development Award. Altogether, the GEMSSTAR award will play a critical role towards my
development as an independent physician scientist and future leader in geriatric pulmonology."
10881756,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 The impact of synthetic chemistry on society cannot be overstated. Organic chemistry has changed our world
in momentous ways, from giving women reproductive rights through the invention of contraceptives, to creating
pesticides that allow us to feed the globe. It is axiomatic that innovations in medicine are invariably linked to
advancements in organic chemistry as most medicines are synthesized by organic chemists. It has long been
recognized that the overall shape of a small molecule is the most fundamental factor that controls its biological
effects. It is fortunate that rapid developments in asymmetric synthesis have paved the way for therapeutics to
reach the clinic. These triumphs can be attributed to the many innovations in the realms of enantioselective bond
forming processes such as asymmetric ion pairing, organocatalysis, C–H activation, Lewis acid/base, BrØnsted
acid/base, reductions/oxidations, cross-coupling reactions and many more. Despite these achievements, the
state of the art still falls short in many ways from the ideal. Although each of the unique activation modes outlined
above allow for high chemo-, diastero- and enantio-selectivities to be achieved, in many cases for the desired
bond forming event to occur the substrate must often bear a functional group that is capable of binding or being
activated by a chiral catalyst. In particular, the ability to enantioselectively convert inert C–H bonds into carbon-
carbon bonds at specific locations without the aid of directing groups is highly desirable because it would further
the drug discovery process.
 To address this challenge, our work has focused on the development of new deprotonation substitution
sequences which allow for typically untargetable positions within heterocycles to be directly functionalized.
Specifically, we have found that Lewis bases can extract Li cations from strong organolithium reagents allowing
highly basic ion pairs to be produced and in turn for typically remote and inert C–H bonds in heterocycles to be
deprotonated. Secondly, we have developed a new class of chiral phosphine ligands that enable
enantioconvergent cross-couplings with racemic donor reagents. This proposal seeks to merge these concepts
by developing asymmetric deprotonation cross-coupling sequences that can allow for typically inaccessible
carbon centers to be functionalized. Specific goals of this proposal include: (1) the development of both
organolithium reagents and Lewis bases that when combined allow for typically inert C–H bonds in alkaloids to
be deprotonated; (2) the development of new chiral phosphine ligands that enable enantioconvergent Negishi
cross-coupling reactions with racemic donor reagents; and (3) the development of asymmetric deprotonation
cross-coupling sequences that allow for biologically relevant alkaloids to be directly functionalized in a single
synthetic operation."

communication breakdown is a leading contributor to patient safety and harm events. A 2010 study estimated
that inefficient clinical communication cost US hospitals an estimated $12 billion annually in wasted clinician
time and increased lengths of stay. The introduction of technologies such as smartphones and secure text
messaging are transforming how, when, and what acute care clinicians communicate among each other.
Developing an infrastructure to proactively evaluate these systems, and build their resilience, is critical. The
goal of this project is to create a novel, nurse-led Pediatric Patient Safety Learning Lab with the objective of
reengineering interprofessional (e.g., nurse-physician) communication work systems for pediatric acute care
settings. The Learning Lab will consist of a multidisciplinary team of clinician-researchers, human factors
engineers, human-centered design experts, and operational safety experts from Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania. We will also engage stakeholders, including bedside clinicians
and families of hospitalized children, whose experience of care may be altered by changes to how clinicians
communicate. We will use a systems engineering approach (Problem Analysis, Design, Development,
Implement, and Evaluate) to proactively assess the interprofessional communication work system, processes,
and outcomes, to identify opportunities for improvement before safety events occur. The Specific Aims of this
project are to (1) Conduct a problem analysis of the interprofessional communication work system and work
processes used in the care of hospitalized children; (2) Design and develop interventions to engineer a safer,
more effective, and more resilient interprofessional communication work system; (3) Implement and evaluate
the interventions in the clinical environment to gauge real-world impact. Our Learning Lab will be guided by two
frameworks, the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model and the Integrated Resilience
Attributes Framework. The product of this Learning Lab will be a resilient system for interprofessional
communication, one that can positively adapt in the face of anticipated and unanticipated changes and
maintain the safety of care provided during the estimated 2.5 million pediatric hospitalizations each year."

 .
Nursing home staff shortages are well known to be an important factor impacting both the quality of care that
nursing home residents receive, their health outcomes, and healthcare worker outcomes. Staffing shortages are
compounded by limited financial resources in nursing homes, especially for smaller nursing homes, which was
further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. These staffing shortages disproportionately impact nursing
home residents living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) as they require more time from
staff compared to care for residents who do not have ADRD. As the number of Americans living with ADRD
increases, the need for fully staffed nursing homes that can provide quality care for older adults living with ADRD
is now more important than ever.
During public health emergencies, direct funding to nursing homes has been proposed as an expedient way to
prevent staffing losses and maintain safety standards for residents. One federal policy mechanism utilized by
nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic was the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP loan
program offers a unique natural experiment by which to evaluate the effectiveness and efficacy of a program
that directly funds small businesses and in the case of this project, nursing homes, to maintain safe staffing
levels during public health emergencies. While PPP loans were effective overall at keeping workers on the payroll
across all US small businesses, it is unclear if the effects of the program were equitable across nursing homes
in socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods which prior work from our team showed have lower staffing rates.
Using robust econometric methods and an exploratory sequential mixed methods approach, the proposed
project will assess the effectiveness and equity of PPP funding by 1) examining changes in staffing patterns and
resident outcomes among nursing homes that received the PPP loans compared to nursing homes that did not
and evaluating whether changes in staffing patterns and outcomes were equitable for those with ADRD living in
the most socioeconomically deprived facilities; 2) qualitatively exploring facility strategies, tools, and social
contexts that promoted resilience to declines in staffing and ADRD resident outcomes after receipt of PPP, and
3) quantitatively assessing the extent to which resilience strategies, cultures, and behaviors identified in Aim 2
are reflected in administrative actions about staffing and care for residents with ADRD, and how actions differed
by neighborhood context. The overall goal is to develop a framework by which to guide future nursing home
responses to public health emergencies that will improve staff patterns and subsequent ADRD outcomes in the
most socioeconomically deprived/lowest-resourced neighborhoods."

We propose the novel Pediatric Prehospital Airway Resuscitation Trial (Pedi-PART) to determine the best paramedic
strategies for managing the airway in critically ill or injured children. Requirements of a clinical trial include the
following: a) study of common paramedic airway techniques, b) integration of the range of critical conditions
requiring airway management, c) an enrolled study population large enough to yield meaningful results, and d)
innovative approaches to enhance the feasibility and applicability of the trial. A key innovation will be the novel
Bayesian Adaptive Sequential Platform Trial (BASiC-PT) framework used to determine the relative effectiveness
of three airway techniques (BVM, ETI, SGA) across three disease subgroups (cardiac arrest, trauma, respiratory
failure) for all pediatric age categories, maximizing available information while minimizing the number of patients.
The novel design of Pedi-PART overcomes analytic, logistical, and financial barriers that make a traditional trial
design infeasible. Our aims are:
Specific Aim 1. To provide biostatistical leadership and expertise, assistance in protocol design, study imple-
 mentation and management, data collection and management, study reporting and metrics, assistance in
 interim and final study analyses, and production of public use research datasets in the establishment and
 execution of the Pedi-PART study.
Specific Aim 2. To provide logistical support and technical expertise for Pedi-PART investigators and coordina-
 tors, through effective study training, efficient quality monitoring, communication and engagement of study
 personnel, maintenance of study regulatory documents, and preparation of useful study materials (e.g.,
 manual of operations) to enhance the implementation of the trial.
 Pedi-PART is a pragmatic trial designed to provide a solid evidence base for best practice in paramedic
pediatric airway management. These results will identify the ideal airway techniques to be used, enabling the
generation of guidelines for the highest level of prehospital care for children here and across the globe."

OVERALL COMPONENT
The Developmental Exposure Alcohol Research Center (DEARC) conducts critically needed, rigorous research
recognizing that alcohol misuse and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) have deep roots in early development. Since
its inception, the DEARC has operated as a highly successful, rapidly evolving, integrative research center
located at Binghamton University. The central theme of the DEARC is that early developmental exposure to
alcohol makes individuals susceptible to alcohol misuse and development of AUD across the lifespan, thereby
compromising neurobehavioral function and the trajectory of healthy aging. The overarching purpose/goal of
the DEARC is to promote rapid gains in our understanding of alcohol action(s) on the developing brain, so that
effective treatments can be developed and optimized for the future. The Center provides the scientific
leadership and a unified scientific framework to guide multiple interconnecting projects toward a set of common
scientific objectives in ways that individual R-type grants could not. The DEARC will focus on two primary
neurodevelopmental periods when ethanol exposure is most prevalent: during gestation through maternal
consumption of alcohol; and during adolescent exposure, a key age for initiation of alcohol use characterized
by binge and high-intensity drinking that are less common for adults. Importantly, the proposed renewal
includes projects that will examine interactional influences of prenatal and adolescent alcohol exposure and
expands into a broader lifespan perspective by including hypotheses targeting effects of early alcohol exposure
on aging. Through the use of integrative research teams with broad interdisciplinary expertise, the DEARC is
distinctively positioned to achieve its 3 clearly defined scientific objectives: (1) To identify neurobehavioral
mechanisms contributing to heightened ethanol acceptance during adolescence, and how individual
characteristics (sex, genotype) moderate these effects; (2) To delineate the neurobehavioral effects of early life
(prenatal and adolescent) exposure to ethanol, and persistence of these effects across the lifespan; and (3) To
establish a mechanistic framework for understanding ethanol-mediated affective dysfunction, cognitive decline,
and pathological aging. This renewal application features 5 Main Research Components that use established
rodent models of fetal and/or adolescent ethanol exposure to explore mechanisms contributing to the cycle of
alcohol misuse and the adverse consequences of early developmental exposure to alcohol. Complementary
pilot projects will be vetted and supported by a Pilot Project Core designed to enrich and accelerate
achievement of DEARC scientific objectives, while also cultivating career paths for early career investigators
and promoting human, conceptual, and technical diversity. All components are supported by an Administrative
Core with a strong and well-established structure that will provide scientific leadership, identify opportunities for
collaboration, and promote synergistic outcomes through strategic planning and guidance."

ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Developmental Exposure Alcohol Research Center (DEARC) supports projects and investigators at
Binghamton University to advance rigorous studies to understand ethanol action(s) on the developing brain so
that effective treatments (cognitive, behavioral, pharmacotherapeutic, etc) can be developed and optimized for
the future. The proposed renewal of the Center includes 5 Main Projects and a Pilot Project Core. The
Administrative Core provides the organizational framework for the efficient management, direction, and
coordination of Center activities to ensure that Center-wide goals and objectives, as described in the Overall
Component, are fully realized. In essence, the policies, procedures, and Aims outlined in the Administrative Core
become the tools through which the vision of the Overall Component is achieved. Led by the Center Director
and the Scientific Director, the Administrative Core provides scientific leadership, identifies opportunities for
collaboration, and promotes synergistic outcomes through strategic planning and guidance of all scientific
components. The Administrative Core ensures scientific components have the scientific, technical, and financial
resources to be successful, including access to software, equipment, protocols, and other readily share-able
materials. Structured oversight provided through regular review of scientific progress, standardization of
technical approaches, and protocol sharing accelerate progress, strengthen scientific rigor, and enhance
reproducibility of scientific findings. The Administrative Core is uniquely poised to broaden the scientific impact
of discoveries arising from Center-supported projects through strategic communications, presentations, and
coordination with external agencies including but not limited to, the Research Society on Alcohol, ISBRA/ESBRA,
and program staff at NIAAA. The Administrative Core supports the professional development of investigators at
all career levels, with a specific priority of engaging and training scholars from diverse backgrounds. The goals
of the Administrative Core, therefore, are to facilitate interaction and promote the highest quality research among
projects by providing clear leadership, efficient management, strong administrative, fiscal and research
infrastructure, and by advancing the integration of projects as a means to achieve synergistic outcomes from the
Center as a whole."

PILOT PROJECT CORE
The Developmental Exposure Alcohol Research Center (DEARC) includes a Pilot Project Core (PPC). The
goals of the PPC are to (i) provide a structured funding mechanism to seed the development of new ideas,
collaborative teams or technical approaches relevant to the central themes of the DEARC; (ii) support career
growth for both young and seasoned investigators, particularly those from historically under-represented
groups, through mentoring and facilitated collaboration; and (iii) capitalize on unique and timely opportunities
that may arise from the rapidly changing, dynamic field of research on alcohol and development. The PPC will
achieve these goals through administration of a Pilot Project program that solicits Pilot Project Proposals from
eligible investigators, coordinates the review process for proposals received, and ultimately oversees the
award and reporting functions for all supported Pilot Projects. In addition, the PPC will help promote scientific
connections among new members of the DEARC, and between these new members and established DEARC
investigators to further increase scientific synergy and promote both peer-based and mentor-mentee
relationships within the Center. Pilot Projects will be supported for 1-2 years each and will be funded at $45K
(direct costs) per year. Using this approach, we will support at least 6 funded pilot projects during the proposed
5-year funding period. Two highly innovative Pilot Project proposals are proposed to begin in the first budget
year of this Center. The first pilot project (PI: A. Gano) seeks to examine the transcriptomic effects of a unique
and innovative “double hit” model that examines the additive or interactive effects of prenatal and/or adolescent
ethanol exposure. It will use RNAseq and rtPCR to determine genes and gene networks that are differentially
expressed as a function of ethanol exposure during these two key developmental stages. The second pilot
project (PI: E. Galaj) will test the hypothesis that adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure leads to impaired
conditioned reinforcement learning by dysregulating activity of brainstem cholinergic inputs to the ventral
tegmental area; it will use a combination of optogenetic, fiber photometry and behavioral methods. Future
projects will similarly promote the scientific objectives of the DEARC through novel technical and conceptual
advances. Through support of exciting new projects and investigators, novel collaborative ventures and
technology development efforts, the PPC will serve as an incubator of great new ideas and teams that will
positively contribute to the mission of the DEARC."

MAIN 2
Excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of alcohol-related brain damage and cognitive decline, including
an increased risk for the development of dementia. Converging data from human studies and preclinical animal
models have revealed that extreme alcohol binge drinking/exposure during adolescence is associated with
long-term changes in brain structure and connectivity. Persistent brain damage after adolescent intermittent
ethanol exposure (AIE) in rodents, a model of binge drinking, entails reduced hippocampal neurogenesis,
suppression of the cholinergic neuronal phenotype, and alterations in the ratio between pro and mature
neurotrophins. This brain profile is also seen in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias
(ADRD), as well as in preclinical models of such disorders. Subclinical neuropathology and/or alteration in
neurotrophins following AIE likely makes the brain more vulnerable to the aging process, and normal
compensatory aging responses may fail, leading to the behavioral sequelae of dementia. The goal of this
proposal is to reveal how intermittent alcohol exposure during adolescence alters the normal age-related
trajectory (loss of cholinergic phenotype, reduced neurogenesis) in the F344 rat, as well as the onset of
additional AD-pathological markers (plaque load, hyper tau phosphorylation,) in the TgF344-AD model.
Specifically, we will (a) reveal AIE-induced sex-specific neurotrophic mediators of resilience and susceptibility
to compromised cognitive aging and AD-related pathology (AIM 1); (b) rescue sex-specific AIE-induced
acceleration of pathological age-related cognitive decline and AD pathology by inhibiting the p75NTR cell death
pathway (AIM 2). Finally,
we will determine if exercise load drives the sex-dependent recovery of
AIE/AD-associated spatial memory impairment and neuropathology
(AIM 3). Our preliminary data revealed a
profile that AIE accelerates age-related cognitive impairment in male rats, and amplifies pathological aging in
female rats with AD transgenes. Ultimately, this proposal will d
etermine the sex-specific drivers of accelerated
age-related pathology associated with alcohol use disorders to inform effective therapeutic approaches to halt
the progressive development of dementia."

MAIN 3
The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) plays an indispensable role in protecting the Central Nervous System (CNS) by
restricting the ability of blood-borne pathogens, circulating immune cells, and macromolecules from passing into
the brain parenchyma where these agents can exert a disruptive influence on CNS function. Recent studies have
shown that BBB integrity waxes and wanes in response to psychological distress and immunological challenge,
contributing to anxiety, depression, and even heightened suicidality. Importantly, human post-mortem studies
showed BBB disruption among deceased males with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Our lab recently revealed
long-lasting effects of Adolescent Intermittent Ethanol (AIE) on BBB integrity that were sex-specific and brain
region-selective. In males, AIE-induced BBB alterations were evident in early adulthood after a three-week period
of forced abstinence, whereas females were largely unaffected. These findings call for comprehensive studies
of sex-specific neurovascular dysfunction associated with AIE. One biological mechanism known to compensate
for compromised BBB integrity is through increased deposition of Amyloid-b (Ab) protein in perivascular regions,
which, as a “sticky” protein, attempts to seal the BBB and prevent enhanced permeability. Importantly, AIE has
recently been shown to increase Ab(1-42) deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation in 3X transgenic mouse model
of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), exclusively in females when tested at 6-7 months of age. Consistent with this, we
recently reported that long-term ethanol consumption later in life increased co-localization of Ab(1-42) in iba1+
cells (microglia) that were located in close proximity to the neurovasculature exclusively in female rats, and in
the absence of transgenes that promote vulnerability to familial AD. Thus, emerging evidence suggests that
chronic intermittent ethanol exposure produces distinctive patterns of neurovascular dysfunction in males and
females, contributing to sex-specific outcomes later in life. The over-arching goal of this proposal, therefore, is
to determine the sex-specific mechanisms by which AIE produces long-lasting changes in neurovascular
integrity, with male-specific increases in BBB permeability and female-specific increases in Ab(1-42) deposition
playing major roles in AIE-associated neurovascular dysfunction. Studies proposed in three Specific Aims will (i)
fill critical gaps in our knowledge regarding natural development of the BBB during adolescence, (ii) provide new
insight into reactivity of the BBB to acute ethanol challenge during adolescence and adulthood; (iii) establish
distinct and separable paths of AIE-induced neurovascular dysfunction in male and female rats across adulthood;
and (iv) test novel hypotheses regarding loss of BBB integrity as a harbinger of neurovascular dysfunction. These
studies will provide much needed information about contributions of early life alcohol exposure to the
development of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), including vascular dementia, Cerebral
Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA), and Vascular contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID)."

MAIN 5
Alcohol consumption during early pregnancy is a common occurrence in our society. Unfortunately, prenatal
alcohol exposure increases the risk of onset of alcohol consumption to problematic levels earlier in
adolescence. Both prenatal and adolescence periods are critical windows for neurodevelopment and insults to
the developing nervous system, such as alcohol exposure, may dysregulate typical neurogenesis and synapse
formation, ultimately resulting in behavioral maladaptations such as augmented anxiety-like behavior and
pathological pain perception. The pain and the addiction circuit overlap with many mesocortical interactions.
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is at the intersection of addiction and pain circuit and receives dopamine
projections from the ventral tegmental area. Dopamine in the ACC contributes to the excitation/inhibition
balance within layer 2/3 in the ACC and is affected by chronic ethanol exposure during adolescence in the
nucleus accumbens in a sex- and age of exposure-dependent manner. Interestingly however, changes in
cortical dopamine and the resulting shift in excitation/inhibition balance is unknown following prenatal ethanol
exposure (PAE), adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure (AIE), or double-hit with PAE+AIE exposure.
Therefore in Main Project 5, we will elucidate the effect of PAE alone, AIE alone, and the combination of the
two (PAE+AIE) on the interplay between dopamine and glutamate and the resulting changes in affective
behavior and mechanical nociception. Our overarching hypothesis is that PAE+AIE exposure synergistically
augments anxiety-like behaviors and mechanical allodynia in male and female rats via altered interactions
between glutamate and dopamine in the ACC. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will examine the excitability of
glutamate neurons and dopamine terminal excitability in the ACC during protracted abstinence from PAE, AIE,
and PAE+AIE exposures using electrophysiology and fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), respectively. We
predict that PAE+AIE with reduce glutamate and dopamine transmission significantly more than either PAE or
AIE alone. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of subsequent ethanol exposure on overall neural activity
and glutamate and dopamine transmission in ACC layer 2/3 using electrophysiology and FSCV, respectively.
We expect to find a sensitized response to acute ethanol with respect to glutamate and dopamine transmission
in PAE+AIE exposed rats compared to rats with single (PAE or AIE) exposure. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
determine a causal link between ACC layer 2/3 neuron activity and/or dopamine and anxiety-like behavior and
mechanical allodynia using chemogenetics. We predict that dysregulation in both glutamate and dopamine will
contribute to the pathological pain perception and augmented anxiety-like behavior in PAE+AIE exposed rats.
Collectively, this proposal will identify the impact of alcohol exposure during two developmentally critical
windows on interactions between glutamate and dopamine in the ACC resulting in augmented anxiety-like
behavior and mechanical allodynia."

In 2021, Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD) accounted for 37% of liver transplants (LTs) performed in the United
States. Given concerns for relapse in alcohol use post-transplant, most centers require that candidates have
been abstinent from alcohol use for 6-months prior to being placed on the waitlist for transplant. However, a
subset of patients present with severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) refractory to medical management and with a
3-month mortality of 70-80% without LT. This dire situation precludes the possibility of a 6-month wait period.
Early LT (ELT) is the only life-saving treatment available for these patients, however, access to this
practice is limited, due to a lack of national consensus on criteria for listing and transplant. We
conducted a pilot study of ELT for SAH. In our initial experience, candidates with SAH who underwent liver
transplant prior to a 6-month wait achieved demonstrated excellent 1-year post-transplant survival and had
identical rates of relapse when compared to LT recipients with 6-month sobriety. Based on these encouraging
findings, we established the DELTA Center (Delivery of Early Liver Transplant for Alcoholic Hepatitis) at Johns
Hopkins University as a specialized alcohol research center. The DELTA center has accrued the world’s
largest cohort of candidates with SAH and ELT recipients in the world. Despite excellent outcomes post-
transplant, we have transplanted a relatively homogenous group of ELT recipient with regards to
sociodemographic factors and it has become clear that access to ELT may not be equitable. Continued work
through our DELTA Center will now focus on continued expansion of ELT with a focus on understanding the
impact of social determinants of health (SDoH) on access and outcomes in ELT. We will leverage the
resources and experience of the DELTA Center and engage relative stakeholders to build an ethical framework
for ELT that can guide dissemination of this practice to other transplant centers. We propose: 1) To identify
SDoH associated with access to ELT; 2) To quantify longer-term post-transplant outcomes for ELT, up to 10-
years; 3) to identify SDoH associated with post-transplant outcomes assess; and 4) To establish an ethical
framework for considering ELT for SAH based on the opinions of SAH patients, transplant providers, and the
general public about this practice, ultimately resulting in a new rational national policy on ELT for SAH. This
study represents the largest and longest prospective cohort study of ELT for SAH. Our findings will
have an immediate and direct impact on the practice of ELT for SAH in the United States, informing
critical aspects of candidate selection, overcoming barriers to access, informed consent, post-LT care and
national policy. Robust quantification of the impact of SDoH on ELT for SAH is novel and necessary to ensure
equity. A better understanding of this emerging treatment is essential for improving care of patients with SAH
and will help improve the feasibility, availability and quality of care we provide to this vulnerable patient
population."
10741445,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Project 2 of the Johns Hopkins DELTA Center for Alcohol Research focuses on studying and implementing
evidence-based alcohol use disorder (AUD) interventions in the post-transplant setting. Alcohol-associated
liver disease (ALD) is the leading indication for liver transplants (LT) in the United States. Our group and others
have demonstrated comparable survival outcomes between recipients of early (ELT; <6-month abstinence)
versus standard liver transplants (SLT; ≥6-month abstinence) for severe ALD. Therefore, we have advocated
that transplant programs waive the arbitrary “6-month rule” to promote equity of access to LT for all patients
with ALD. However, return to alcohol use remains a considerable concern for both ELT and SLT recipients; up
to 40% report alcohol relapse and have 22% lower absolute cumulative survival by three years after LT.
Furthermore, while most transplant programs have historically mandated or enforced pre-LT alcohol treatment,
post-LT treatment services have received far less attention. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
during the previous funding cycle to assess technology-assisted, non-traditional AUD treatments integrated
within routine clinical care during post-LT Year 1. The RCT initially encountered delays due to the COVID-19
pandemic. The trial’s progress has been promising since then, though it has also raised additional salient
questions related to AUD treatment among LT recipients: Do LT-specific factors like surgical complications
affect recipients’ engagement with alcohol treatment services? Does the addition of AUD pharmacotherapy by
LT clinicians promote or discourage patient participation in concurrent psychosocial interventions (PSI)? How
can transplant programs provide continued addiction support beyond the early post-LT period? The next phase
of Project 2 will answer these and other questions related to the post-LT delivery of alcohol treatment services
through a combination of observational studies and intervention trial that builds on our lessons learned during
the previous funding cycle. The specific aims are (1) to ascertain the impact of pre- and post-LT factors on
AUD treatment engagement, (2) to quantify the effect of AUD pharmacotherapy on participation in post-
transplant PSI, and (3) to assess the benefit of peer support specialists on long-term post-LT alcohol
outcomes. The proposed studies will systematically examine early and long-term approaches to increase LT
recipients’ participation in AUD treatment, decrease alcohol relapse risk, and improve overall survival.
Compared to co-located hepatology/addiction clinical models, which face many systems-level obstacles toward
broad dissemination, our interventions are desirable given their greater ease of implementation. Our work will
hold the potential to maximize the benefits of a scarce organ resource for society and improve the overall
cost/benefit balance of LT for patients with severe ALD."

Enteric infections remain highly prevalent worldwide with more than two billion cases and over one million deaths
per year. Although diet has long been linked to infection susceptibility, the dietary factors that regulate intestinal
defense remain poorly understood. In the intestine, there are trillions of microbes, collectively called the
microbiota. Different diets can alter the composition and metabolites produced by these resident microbes in the
intestine. In addition, recent work has highlighted clear links between microbiota colonization and effective
immune responses at mucosal sites. Thus deciphering the interactions between diet, microbiota, and intestinal
immunity will enable development of novel and practical dietary approaches to prevent and treat enteric infection.
My new data provoke the hypothesis that metabolism of the nutrient phytate by commensal bacteria can
decrease intestinal infection and boost host defense mechanisms. Studies outlined in this proposal will directly
test this hypothesis by determining (i) how phytate-enriched diet enhances host intestinal defense in mouse and
human intestine, and (ii) whether the microbiota is needed for phytate-mediated defense against intestinal
infection. Delineating the contribution of diet and microbiota will significantly expand our understanding of
mechanisms involved in intestinal immune regulation and inflammation.
During my training as a veterinarian, I discovered my strong interest in understanding how the diet-microbiota
relationship regulates intestinal infection. For this reason, I initiated the proposed project with Dr. Theresa
Alenghat that will build upon my knowledge of mucosal immunology and enable me to transition into the fields
of nutrition and microbiota. My thesis and initial postdoctoral work have provided me with an excellent foundation
in immunology and epithelial biology, but I still lack technical skills and conceptual expertise in diet, gnotobiotics,
metagenomic analyses, and human intestinal organoids. My mentors, Dr. Alenghat and Dr. James Wells, along
with an exceptional scientific environment, will enable me to utilize modern, innovative approaches in my
research and collaborate with top investigators. My understanding of disease in a broad range of species,
coupled with my prior research, have provided me with a strong and unique foundation. Over the next five years,
I fully anticipate that this background in conjunction with my current research plan will allow me to successfully
carry out the proposed project. The mentoring and training I will receive from Dr. Alenghat and Dr. Wells, and
from the wider Cincinnati Children’s community, will enable me to successfully transition into an independent
scientist that can address clinically relevant questions at the interface of nutrition, microbiota, and infection."

Rapid disease progression and chemotherapy resistant disease are frequently observed among the most
common T-cell lymphomas (TCL) and the majority of these patients will ultimately succumb to progressive
disease within three years of diagnosis. Only a minority (≤10%) of patients will achieve a durable remission
with novel agents, as the mechanisms promoting TCL progression and chemotherapy resistance are poorly
understood and therapeutic strategies to overcome them are not defined. We have recently shown that the T-
cell transcription factor GATA-3 identifies a molecularly, genetically, and clinically distinct subset of TCL that
are highly resistant to chemotherapy. We have also demonstrated that Notch activation is prevalent in the TCL,
and Notch blockade inhibits both TCL proliferation and GATA-3 expression, a Notch target gene, in preliminary
studies. Genetic and pharmacologic loss-of-function (and gain-of-function) strategies were performed in
genetically diverse TCL cells and subsequently demonstrated that GATA-3 directly confers resistance to
chemotherapy in a cell-autonomous fashion. In addition, lymphoma-associated macrophages (LAM) within the
tumor microenvironment (TME) promote chemotherapy resistance, and GATA-3 dependent cytokines regulate
their functional polarization, highlighting an additional non-cell-autonomous mechanism for GATA-3-dependent
chemotherapy resistance. Thus, there is a critical need to identify factors regulating GATA-3 expression and
function in these aggressive TCL. In the absence of such knowledge, the development of therapeutic
strategies that impair GATA-3-dependent transcriptional regulation and improve outcomes among these TCL
will remain elusive. Our long-term goals are to understand the fundamental mechanisms that drive TCL
pathogenesis and promote their resistance to currently available therapies. In doing so, we hope to develop
rationally designed therapeutic strategies that will overcome the challenge of chemotherapy resistance and
improve outcomes for patients afflicted with these TCL. Our overall objectives in this application are to evaluate
the role of Notch signaling in T-cell lymphomagenesis and to identify the requirements for optimal GATA-3
DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. These will be achieved by addressing our central hypothesis that
Notch and GATA-3 promote TCL progression and resistance to chemotherapy. In addition to being well-
grounded in our own preliminary data, our central hypothesis is entirely consistent with our current
understanding of the genetic landscape and molecular pathogenesis of the TCL and has significant therapeutic
implications."

The foveola, the 1-deg retinal region where cones are most densely packed, is of paramount importance for vision.
Damage to this tiny portion of the retina has devastating consequences for many daily activities as humans use it
to resolve fine details in the visual scene. Yet, primarily as a consequence of technical challenges, little is known
about the mechanisms of foveal vision. A major difficulty in studying foveal functions comes from the need to
finely control retinal stimulation. At this scale, both placing and maintaining a stimulus at a desired eccentricity is
difficult, because of uncertainty in localizing the center of gaze, and because of the continual retinal motion caused
by fixational eye movements, the slow eye drifts and small saccades (microsccades) that humans continually
perform. Recent technical developments offer complementary strengths for overcoming these challenges: high-
resolution retinal imaging allows for high-precision eye-tracking and gaze-contingent retinal stimulation while at
the same time imaging the central fovea, yet it poses limitations in how psychophysical testing is conducted and
makes it challenging to run high volume of subjects/trials. On the other hand, high-precision video eye-tracking
coupled with gaze-contingent display control provides a flexible way for testing vision at the fine grain of the
foveola and acquire large volume of data, but it does not provide information on foveal anatomy. To overcome
these limitations this research uses a unique blend of these cutting-edge techniques for flexibly mapping visual
functions and attention at the fine scale and linking oculomotor behavior, visual perception and anatomy in the
foveola. The overarching goal of this research is to determine the limits and constraints of foveal vision and the
mechanisms the visuomotor system relies on to compensate for these limitations, and to optimize fine spatial
vision. Foveal vision will be investigated from three different perspectives: how eye movements and retinal
anatomy jointly shape fine spatial vision in the foveola (Aim 1), how oculomotor plasticity and attention contribute
to fine spatial vision in the foveola (Aim 2), how attention and the interplay with peripheral vision constrain the
temporal dynamics of foveal processing (Aim 3). By bridging anatomy, oculomotor behavior and visual acuity, the
research in Aim 1 will examine the fine modulations of visual acuity and cone density across the central fovea,
how ocular drift varies in relation to cone density and whether the location chosen as the preferred retinal locus
has an impact on acuity. Research in Aim 2 will examine the plasticity of microsaccades and how fine control of
attention acts at spatial frequencies near the resolution limit and to compensate for anisotropies in sensitivity in
the central fovea. Research in Aim 3 will elucidate how the temporal dynamics of vision and attention change
foveally and extrafoveally and how sensitivity to co-occurring foveal and extrafoveal stimuli is modulated during
fixation. The outcomes of this research may raise the possibility that fine control of attention and fixational eye
movements can counteract vision loss within the central fovea in the early stages of certain diseases, and they
may open the way for visual rehabilitation procedures acting on the fine control of eye movements and attention."

Astrocytes are important regulators of neural circuit activity. Intracellular astrocyte Ca2+ signaling often correlates with
local synaptic activity and behavioral state. Astrocytes express a range of neurotransmitters (NTs) receptors, in many
contexts respond to NTs with increases in cellular Ca2+, and disruption of astrocyte calcium signaling can meaningfully
impact neurophysiology and animal behavior. However, the mechanisms by which astrocytes sense neurotransmission,
signal intracellularly and ultimately modulate circuit function remain poorly defined. Our goal is to identify and
functionally characterize endogenous signaling molecules that allow astrocytes to regulate neural circuits.
 We use Drosophila as a model to study astrocyte biology. Flies astrocytes are similar to their mammalian
counterparts by morphological, developmental, molecular and functional criteria, and this system offers a powerful array
of tools for characterizing gene function in vivo. In the previous cycle, we identified a simple circuit where
octopamine/tyramine (the fly orthologs of norepinephrine, NE) signal directly to astrocytes thought the Octopamine-
Tyramine Receptor (Oct-TyrR) GPCR, this activates the TRP channel Water Witch (Wtrw), which stimulates intracellular
astrocyte Ca2+ signaling and modifies downstream neuronal activity and behavior. This work (1) established a fly circuit
to study how astrocytes respond to neuromodulatory input and modulate circuits, and (2) demonstrated NE/Oct/Tyr-
dependent modulation of astrocyte Ca2+ signaling is an evolutionarily conserved astrocytic signaling mechanism.
 In preliminary work we found bath application of many NTs (i.e. glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA and dopamine)
failed to elicit Ca2+ signaling events in astrocytes. However, a brief pre-exposure of astrocytes to Oct/Tyr resulted in
potent astrocytic Ca2+ signaling events in response to these NTs within seconds, which depended on Oct-TyrR. This
suggests an arousal stimulus (i.e. norepinephrine/Oct/Tyr) gates the ability of astrocytes to sense the NTs Glu, Ach,
GABA and DA, and dramatically changes astrocyte function in vivo. In Aim 1 we will determine how PLC and
DAG/IP3 signaling downstream of Oct-TyrR regulate astrocyte sensitivity to Glu, GABA and Ach. In Aim 2 we will
characterize the role of adenylate cyclase, cAMP and PKA in gating astrocyte sensitivity to dopamine after Oct/Tyr
exposure. We will identify the source(s) of Ca2+ signaling activated by these NTs (e.g. is it Wtrw?), and explore how these
Oct/Tyr-gated events affect animal behavior. Finally, we will explore how astrocyte Ca2+ signaling events regulate neural
activity and behavior—among the most important unsolved questions in our field. In preliminary work we performed a
forward genetic screen for genes that when knocked down selectively in astrocytes, suppressed the ability of TRP
channel-mediated astrocyte Ca2+ entry to induce seizure behavior. We identified many genes, most of which are also
expressed in mammalian astrocytes, and each provides a potential molecular foothold to understand how astrocyte Ca2+
signals to neurons to drive changes in circuit activity. In Aim 3 we will characterize the roles of these molecules in
astrocyte Ca2+ signaling, silencing of downstream DA neurons, and ultimately Oct/Tyr-mediated behavior. This work will
significantly advance our understanding of how astrocytes process NT input to modify circuits and guide behavior."
10848440,"Project Summary. In Schizophrenia (SCZ), early interventions can make a difference, particularly for cognitive
dysfunction, a core feature of SCZ that predicts poorer clinical trajectories and functional outcomes. Cognitive
impairments in SCZ have been linked to abnormalities in sleep and sleep-specific oscillations—spindles and
slow waves— which have been established in SCZ, although mostly in chronic patients. As first steps towards
translating these observations into novel, timely interventions, we aim to establish: whether sleep oscillatory and
cognitive deficits are present in early course (EC-SCZ) patients vs. healthy controls (HC), and if these deficits
are related to each other; and 2) whether sleep manipulation with auditory stimulation can improve sleep
oscillation deficits in EC-SCZ, and if sleep oscillatory changes are related to cognitive changes in these patients.
Sleep spindles are waxing and waning, 12-16 Hz oscillations that represent the hallmark of NREM stage 2 sleep.
Slow waves are large amplitude, ~1 Hz brain oscillations that characterize NREM stage 3. We and others have
demonstrated marked deficits in sleep spindles, and to a lesser extent, slow waves in SCZ and reduced spindle
density is associated with worse memory consolidation (MC), a key cognitive function known to be altered in
SCZ. However, most of the evidence is in chronic SCZ, while the presence of altered sleep oscillations and MD
at illness onset would establish these features as robust markers of SCZ. Thus, the first goal of this proposal is
to establish whether spindle and slow wave deficits are present and are associated with reduced MC
performance in EC-SCZ patients relative to HC. We will also examine the association between sleep oscillatory
deficits and cognitive controls (CC) and working memory (WM), cognitive functions that have been linked to
spindles and slow waves in HC and are impaired in EC-SCZ patients.
To establish whether ameliorating sleep alterations may contribute to novel treatment interventions, we first need
to ascertain that sleep and sleep oscillatory deficits can be manipulated. An EEG closed-loop system, which
delivers auditory stimuli during sleep, consistently enhances slow wave and spindle activity in HC. This system,
which involves using a wireless device, can be employed with a simultaneous polysomnogram (PSG) in the
sleep laboratory to enhance feasibility and validity. However, no study has used this closed-loop approach in
SCZ. The second goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that sleep spindles and slow waves deficits can be
acutely modified with closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) during sleep in EC-SCZ patients and to examine
whether CLAS-related spindle and slow wave changes are associated with cognitive changes in these patients.
We propose to perform wireless/PSG overnight sleep recordings and assess performance in the motor sequence
tapping (MST), a MC task, as the main cognitive measure and performance in the AX-CPT for CC and WM as a
secondary cognitive measure, in 70 EC-SCZ and 70 HC subjects. EC-SCZ patients will also undergo auditory
stimulation and sham nights in a double-blind, cross-over design with sleep, MST, and AX-CPT assessments."
10726591,"Diabetes is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the veteran population. The Veteran
population are particularly susceptible for diabetes, with a staggering 70% of Veterans at risk for diabetes. 25%
of all Veterans have diabetes, similar to that seen in older Americans from the general population. A failure to
increase the β-cell proliferation and functional β-cell mass in response to increasing metabolic demand from
insulin resistance associated with obesity and aging, underlies most causes of adult onset diabetes in
veterans. It is, therefore, imperative to identify pathways that regulate functional β-cell mass that could be
leveraged for treating β-cell failure and diabetes. Our data demonstrate that Tead1, a critical transcriptional
effector of the mammalian Hippo pathway, is robustly expressed in mouse and human islets and has a non-
redundant role in regulating β-cell proliferation and function. The mammalian Hippo-Tead1 pathway consists of
a core kinase cascade, culminating with Lats1&2, inhibitory kinases, that phosphorylate coactivators, Yap and
Taz, preventing their nuclear translocation and co-activation of Tead1-mediated transcription regulating cell
proliferation and apoptosis. The premise for this proposal rests on our preliminary data that strongly suggest
that Tead1 is the switch regulating the proliferation restriction, while promoting mature function in adult β-cells.
Recent reports have found some contrasting results, wherein, (a) Yap-Tead1 act as an enhancer in many β-
cell maturation genes in human embryonic pancreatic progenitors, (b) Yap has also been shown to inhibit
endocrinogenesis in mice, and acquisition of mature function during differentiation of human iPS cells
(hIPSCs), but (d) sufficient to induce proliferation in human islets, ex vivo. Preliminary data shows that β-cell
specific Tead1 deletion leads to diabetes and glucose intolerance. Tead1-null islets display a decrease in
expression of mature β-cell markers and a loss of glucose stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, our data
indicates that embryonic Tead1 deletion in β-cells also led to profound diabetes suggesting that Tead1 is
required in the endocrine progenitors for normal differentiation. To comprehensively test the regulation of β-cell
differentiation, proliferation and function by the Hippo-tead1 pathway, we hypothesize that Tead1 regulates
β-cell proliferation and acquisition of mature function via context-dependent co-factor specific,
transcriptional regulation of a network of proliferation and mature-phenotype defining genes. The
broad goal is to mechanistically delineate key pathways regulating functional β-cell mass that can be
harnessed to promote human β-cell proliferation with preserved function, through genetic loss- and gain-of-
function studies using in vivo mouse models and ex vivo mouse and human islets and human iPSCs. We will
specifically 1. To test if enhancing Yap activity in adult β-cells in vivo is sufficient for β-cell proliferation
and maintenance of mature function via co-activation of Tead1, in GOF studies (overexpressing
constitutively nuclear phospho-mutant YapS112A specifically in adult mouse β-cells using a Tet-On system) in
inducing proliferation and expansion of β-cells under high fat diet induced insulin resistant stat, identifying
direct targets of Tead1 in β-cells under basal and proliferating states and delineate Tead1 dependent and
independent Yap targets in β-cells. 2. Test if mammalian Hippo-Tead1 pathway is required for human β-
cell differentiation and proliferation by assessing if Yap/Taz-Tead1 regulates iPSC differentiation into
pancreatic progenitors and β-cells and identify the molecular targets of Tead1 in this process. We will also test
if modulation of Tead1 activity improves β-cell function and proliferation in isolated human islets and if this
regulatory role is impaired in diabetes. Collectively the proposed studies will critically address how the Hippo-
Tead1 pathway regulates β-cell function and proliferation in human β-cells. With the significant rise in incidence
of diabetes in veterans, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapies to reverse declining functional β-cell
mass and successful completion of the proposed experiments will address this critical need."

Heart failure (HF) remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., and the rest of the western world.
Approximately 37% of myocardial infarction (MI) patients will die from HF within 1 year, and of those who do
survive, two-thirds do not make a complete recovery. Each year it is estimated that ~550K Americans will have
a new MI, and ~200K will have a recurrent MI, leading to a large body of patients suffering from HF.1 Therefore,
our long-term goal is the development of new, minimally invasive, targeted biomaterial based therapies for the
treatment of acute MI (AMI), thereby limiting the number of patients that progress to HF. Over the past two
decades, there has been significant progress in the development injectable biomaterials that stimulate
endogenous repair on their own or through the controlled release of additional therapeutics. This approach is
attractive since potential therapies could be delivered minimally invasively via catheter, would be off the shelf
and cost-effective, and in the case of therapeutic delivery, would provide targeted delivery limiting systemic off-
target effects that plague traditional pharmaceuticals. However, direct injection of these biomaterials, either
through minimally invasive surgery or percutaneous transendocardial injection, is unlikely to be translated to AMI
patients because of serious safety concerns with the injection procedures, thereby missing the critical therapeutic
window immediately post-MI. Together, the PIs developed enzyme-responsive, injectable nanoparticles (NPs),
capable of responding to matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) associated with AMI. The particles accumulate
efficiently in infarcted myocardium following systemic administration, by virtue of an enzyme-induced phase
transition from small NP to micron-sized scaffold. While we had initial success with this system and observed
better targeting compared to traditional modalities, this system suffers the same drawback as most nanoparticles,
which have significant off-target accumulation, as they are phagocytosed and transported to the liver following
opsonization. Leveraging our success with the general MMP responsive targeting strategy, we propose that a
new MMP responsive material comprised of a completely aqueous soluble polymer displaying therapeutic
peptides at high densities will have superior biodistribution patterns nanoparticles. Upon systemic administration,
these polymers exhibit exceptionally favorable pharmacokinetics (week-long half-lives) and biodistribution
characterized by kidney clearance combined with very little liver/spleen accumulation. These polymers are
protein like in molecular weight (MW), physicochemical properties and size. They are therapeutic proteomimetic
polymers, designed to accumulate at the site of AMI. Here, we aim to develop new MMP responsive polymeric
systems (termed protein-like polymers, PLPs) and demonstrate proof-of-concept for using these novel
biomaterials for the targeted delivery of therapeutics for AMI."

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) significantly burdens youth 13–17 years of age in the United States (US).
Adolescents also have high rates of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which increases risk of HIV
acquisition and transmission. Sexual, gender, and racial/ethnic minority adolescents are disproportionately
affected. Increasing HIV/STI testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use are key components of the US
national strategy to decrease HIV rates among adolescents. Despite this, few adolescents have received
HIV/STI testing or PrEP. Confidentiality concerns are a significant barrier to HIV/STI testing and PrEP use
among adolescents. To allay these concerns, many states have enacted statutes permitting minors to waive
guardian consent for HIV/STI testing, treatment, and prevention services, including PrEP. Although these laws
are meant to protect youth from unwanted disclosure to their guardians—and thereby increase uptake of
HIV/STI testing and PrEP—there is a dearth of research assessing how these laws relate to behavior and
whether youth are aware of these laws. Our proposed study addresses this gap through pursuing three aims.
First, to assess longitudinal changes in minor consent laws for HIV/STI testing, treatment, and prevention from
1985–present, legal experts on our team will conduct the first-ever longitudinal content analysis of state minor
consent laws. A longitudinal dataset specifying and quantifying changes in the laws over time and by state will
be created and made publicly available. Second, we will longitudinally evaluate the effect of changes in minor
consent laws on HIV/STI testing and treatment among adolescents. To do this we will link the longitudinal legal
dataset created in the first aim to adolescent health behavior data in the National Survey of Family Growth.
Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach, we will evaluate whether changes in minor consent
laws were associated with changes in HIV/STI testing and treatment for youth overall and by sex, race/ethnicity
and sexual minority status. Third, we will assess relations between current knowledge and perceptions of
minor consent laws, HIV/STI testing, and PrEP uptake among adolescents via a cross-sectional online survey
of adolescents (N = 6120, ages 13-17 years) from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The survey will
examine: (1) knowledge and perceptions of current minor consent laws; (2) HIV/STI testing and PrEP
knowledge and uptake; and (3) best practices for disseminating this information to youth. Analyses will be
conducted for youth overall and by sex, gender, race/ethnicity and sexual minority status. This study will (1)
provide the most comprehensive, methodologically rigorous evaluation of minor consent legislation to date; (2)
identify for the first time how these statutory protections affect testing and treatment over time; and (3) identify
awareness and comprehension of these laws, as well as potential barriers that continue to impede HIV/STI
testing and PrEP access among adolescents."

Apicomplexan parasites include the etiologic agents of many widespread infections of humans and livestock,
such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. These diseases are caused by destruction of the host tissues in which the
parasites replicate. Because apicomplexans only replicate inside host cells, the process of invasion is critical to
their survival and pathogenesis. Invasion is mediated by the release of proteins from specialized secretory
organelles at the apical end of the parasite, the micronemes and rhoptries. Microneme proteins include
adhesins that support parasite motility and are therefore secreted as soon as parasites emerge from replication
and start migrating towards new host cells to infect. Rhoptries, by contrast, secrete their contents only upon
host cell recognition once parasites have committed to invasion. Evidence suggests that the release of rhoptry
contents depends on the prior secretion of microneme proteins; however, the molecular events that link these
two processes are unknown. Based on a genome-wide screen in the model apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii,
our lab recently identified a conserved microneme protein necessary for invasion of human cells, which we
named CLAMP. Our preliminary studies show that CLAMP is necessary for rhoptry secretion and stably
associates with two microneme proteins: SPATR, which was previously implicated in invasion, and an
uncharacterized protein we call CLIP. We hypothesize that these interactions represent a novel invasion
complex necessary for rhoptry protein secretion. Our first aim is to compare the functions of CLAMP,
SPATR, and CLIP; investigate how they oligomerize; and elucidate the relationship between complex
formation and rhoptry secretion. In our second aim, we will identify and characterize host and parasite proteins
that interact with the CLAMP invasion complex. Finally, our third aim will take an unbiased look at the host cell
factors that stimulate rhoptry protein secretion, which may intersect with the CLAMP complex to regulate this
key step in apicomplexan invasion. Based on the conservation of the parasite proteins involved, we expect that
the principles uncovered will be generalizable to the phylum and broadly inform our understanding of these
infectious agents."
10737624,"The correct balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) in neuronal circuits is essential for learning
and memory, cognition and behavior. Disrupted inhibition leading to elevated neuronal and circuit excitability is
thought to underlie the pathology of numerous neurological disorders, therefore a comprehensive
understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in synaptic inhibition will have the potential to direct new
therapeutic strategies for treating these conditions. GABAergic inhibitory synapses mediate the majority of
synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system, and their plasticity controls neuronal excitability and function.
The number of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) at inhibitory postsynaptic sites is a key determinant of inhibitory
synapse strength and hence neuronal inhibition. Therefore defining mechanisms by which synaptic GABAARs
are clustered and how they are altered in synaptic plasticity is imperative for understanding inhibition and its
disruption in brain disorders. Using the versatile super-resolution imaging technique, Structured Illumination
Microscopy (SIM), we find that GABAARs and their scaffold, gephyrin, form nanoscale subsynaptic domains
(SSDs) in the inhibitory postsynaptic domain, are modulated during plasticity, and form closely associated pairs
with presynaptic release SSDs in the active zone, suggesting that a modular nanoscale architecture for the
inhibitory synapse may be important for their plasticity and function. Our goal is to determine the mechanisms
that control inhibitory nanoscale organization, understand how this organization influences inhibitory synaptic
function and is altered during synaptic plasticity, and determine how these facets differ between diverse
inhibitory synapse subtypes. This proposal will (1) determine the mechanisms underlying the formation of
postsynaptic inhibitory SSDs during activity-dependent synapse growth, (2) define the mechanisms and
functional relevance of postsynaptic SSD clustering opposite presynaptic release sites, and (3) examine how
subcellular location and interneuron input influence inhibitory nanoscale organization. These aims will test our
overarching hypothesis that inhibitory synaptic nanoscale organization underlies inhibitory synaptic strength,
and its dynamic regulation is a crucial mechanism for synaptic plasticity. These proposed studies will be
significant, being the first comprehensive mechanistic and functional examination of inhibitory synapse
architecture at nanoscale resolution (in both culture and slice) and in real-time during short- and long-term
plasticity paradigms. The widespread importance of this work is that it will greatly expand our understanding of
the detailed mechanisms that control inhibitory synaptic plasticity and inhibition, which is critical for maintaining
E/I balance and neuronal function. Moreover, determining the nanoscale structure of inhibitory synapses in
healthy brains will pave the way for future studies in disease models to provide novel understanding of how
inhibitory synapse structure, function and E/I balance are disrupted in neuropathological disorders."
10886780,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long turnaround time and need for specialised laboratories for conventional culture-based Mycobacterium
tuberculosis drug-susceptibility testing (DST) regularly commits patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-
TB) to months of potentially ineffective treatments. Current commercial molecular tuberculosis (TB) tests can
rapidly identify DR-TB but are limited to testing resistance to a small number of drugs, excluding any new drugs.
In theory, next-generation sequencing (NGS) could comprehensively identify resistance profiles, but is currently
prohibitively expensive for routine use in high-burden, low-resource settings, and knowledge on drug-resistance
mutations is still incomplete. To address this barrier, a fluorescence-based phenotypic assay will be developed
to identify with high specificity resistance to drugs contained in the so-called “BPaLM” regimen, in clinical
specimens. The overall goal of the current K43 application is to advance a novel phenotypic solution to transform
the clinical management of DR-TB in high burden settings. The objectives of the K43 proposal are to 1) provide
critical career advancing training and 2) advance and evaluate a rapid phenotypic workflow requiring minimal
hands-on time within a high throughput TB laboratory. The sample collections and technical staff from an existing
NIH-funded R01 (R01AI153213, PI: John Metcalfe, US primary mentor on this proposal) cluster randomized
controlled trial evaluating the programmatic outcomes associated with benchtop NGS sequencing (the “TS Eliot
study”) will be leveraged. Dr. Rob Warren, Distinguished Professor at Stellenbosch University and the Unit
Director of the South African Medical Research Council Centre for Tuberculosis Research will serve as the LMIC
mentor. Both Dr. Metcalfe and Dr. Warren have vast experience in molecular epidemiology, drug-resistant TB,
and development of diagnostic tests. The project will have the following specific aims: 1) Advance a fluorescence-
based assay as a rapid, high-throughput pDST, and 2) Perform preliminary diagnostic accuracy evaluation of
the assay to detect phenotypic resistance directly in clinical TB specimens. In this study rapid, comprehensive
DST methods will be established, which will continue to inform molecular assays for testing of new and
repurposed drugs. At the end of this K43-funded mentored program, the applicant is expected to be able to lead
a research project independently in the low-resource setting of South Africa. In future research projects based
on the preliminary data generated in the current project, she will be able to answer key questions related to drug-
resistant TB."

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a devastating disease that needs effective treatments. The hallmark of NF2 is
bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs), which progressively enlarge and lead to hearing loss and substantial
negative impacts to quality of life. Identifying well-tolerated drugs to halt VS growth and ameliorate VS-associated
hearing loss is a major unmet medical need. The greatest barrier to managing NF2-related auditory impairment is
our incomplete understanding of how tumors cause hearing loss. We aim to investigate the mechanisms of VS tumor-
induced hearing loss and develop strategies to control VS tumor growth while preventing hearing loss. Our preliminary
studies showed that i) the level of neuroinflammation, including macrophage infiltration and NLRP3
inflammasome activation, negatively correlates with hearing function in patients with VS, and ii) patients’ VSs
secrete inflammatory cytokines and cause cochlear damage. Therefore, we explored the drivers of
neuroinflammation in VS. We identified that Highly Mobility Group Box1 (HMGB1), a potent inflammation
initiator and amplifier, is abundantly secreted by VS tumor cells. Further, we found that HMGB1 blockade: iii)
reduced macrophage chemokine CCL motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) expression and tumor-associated
macrophage (TAM) recruitment, iv) abolished NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1b production, however,
v) HMGB1 blockade activates epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, which may compensate for tumor
growth. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that VS-derived HMGB1: i) recruits inflammatory
macrophages by upregulating the CCL2 chemokine, ii) drives the macrophage inflammatory cascade by
activating the NLRP3 inflammasome, contributing to cochlear damage and hearing loss; and iii) combined
HMGB1 and EGF receptor (EGFR) blockade will concurrently suppress VS growth and prevent tumor-induced
hearing loss. In Aim 1, we will use genetic silencing of HMGB1 and Nlrp3 to investigate the causal role of HMGB1
in regulating CCL2 expression to recruit macrophages and in activating NLRP3 inflammasome to trigger the
macrophage inflammatory response. In Aim 2, using VS mouse models that faithfully reproduce VS tumor-
induced hearing loss, we will characterize the effects of HMGB1 pharmacologic inhibition on hearing function
and cochlear damage. In Aim 3, we will determine the most effective EGFR inhibitor to control tumor growth
and characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of HMGB1 and EGFR inhibitors in the
tumor, mouse brain, and cochlea. Then, using the most effective HMGB1 and EGFR inhibitor identified, we will
evaluate the treatment efficacy of combined HMGB1 and EGFR blockade on tumor growth and hearing in VS
mouse models. Impact: This study will provide pivotal insight into i) the role and mechanisms of HMGB1 in
driving neuroinflammation, ii) the treatment potential and the hearing response following HMGB1 blockade,
and iii) the design of a future clinical trial for NF2-related VS using a novel combination strategy with HMGB1
and EGFR blockade to concurrently control tumor growth and prevent VS-induced hearing loss."

This proposal seeks to determine the regulation of microglial type I interferon signaling following traumatic
brain injury (TBI) and to identify how this affects neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and the
neurocognitive sequelae following TBI. TBI is a major public health problem, representing a leading cause of
death and disability from childhood through middle adulthood. Unfortunately, pharmacologic therapies for TBI
are non-existant. Treatment strategies that target specific secondary injury cascades like dysregulated
neuroinflammation are critically needed. Microglia, the primary immune cells of the CNS, persist in an activated
state for months and years following a single TBI and are associated with neurodegeneration. Mechanisms
that result in sustained, damaging neuroinflammation vs resolution of inflammation are unclear. Our recently
published work, however, demonstrated that the microglial transcriptome at a subacute time point following TBI
was highly enriched for type I interferon stimulated genes raising the question of if type I interferons are key
signaling molecules resulting in sustained, dysregulated microglial activation. The types and cell sources of
type I interferons activating microglia following TBI are unknown. Similarly, the specific effects of type I
interferons on sustained microglial reactivity and the subsequent mechanisms of microglial mediated
neurodegeneration and neurologic dysfunction following TBI remain unknown. Using a lateral fluid percussion
injury model of TBI in mice, combined with sophisticated mouse genetics, our data will uncover cell-specific
effects of type I interferon signaling on secondary injury. The hypothesis of this proposal is that multiple type I
IFNs drive development of dysregulated microglia subsets, immune cell recruitment, and the subsequent
neurodegeneration and neurobehavioral impairments that occur after TBI. In the first aim, we will identify the
types and cell-sources of type I IFNs driving persistent microglial and CNS interferon stimulated gene
expression following TBI. In the second aim, we will determine the impact of type I IFN signaling on microglial
subsets and their transcriptional activation following TBI. Finally, in the third aim, we will determine the
mechanisms by which type I interferon activated microglial impact neuropathology and neurocognitive
dysfunction following TBI, including through their recruitment of CD8+ T cells. As TBI is a leading, untreatable
cause of death and disability in the US, there is a critical need for further study of the specific mechanisms of
secondary injury so that ultimately, new therapies may be discovered."

Aneuploidy, the state in which cells carry an incorrect number of chromosomes, is a major problem for human
health. Aneuploidy is toxic during mammalian development and a leading cause of pregnancy loss. Down
syndrome (DS) due to trisomy 21 is one of the few viable aneuploid syndromes, but affected individuals have
life-long problems including premature aging. Despite intense study, the reasons for aneuploidy toxicity are
still incompletely understood, presenting challenges for understanding DS. In contrast, aneuploidy is very
common in human cancers, where most tumors tolerate and may even benefit from extra chromosomes. It is
unclear how cancer cells overcome the stress of aneuploidy, because we don’t fully understand how
aneuploidy affects cells in the first place. This proposal will utilize an extremely powerful and unique system to
study the consequence of aneuploidy in an important model system, wild strains of budding yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast is a powerful model for dissecting cellular biology, because many of the
mechanisms and defense strategies are conserved in humans. We recently made an exciting discovery that
chromosome duplication in healthy yeast strains disrupts nutrient responses and quiescence, a
conserved cellular program important for growth control and cell maintenance and renewal. Strains of multiple
genetic background and carrying different chromosome amplifications display shared phenotypes, including
incomplete cell-cycle arrest upon nutrient depletion, metabolic aberrations, defects in quiescence-induced
silencing, and ultimately reduced chronological life span. This is remarkable, because defects in similar
markers of quiescence are seen in both DS and many cancers – if disruption of quiescence is a conserved
response to aneuploidy, it could have transformative impacts for future studies. This grant will elucidate how
aneuploidy disrupts quiescence in an important eukaryotic model system. Aim 1 will use dynamic
transcriptomics and single-cell microscopy to characterize the temporal order of defects, test several initial
hypotheses, and implicate upstream regulators. It will also distinguish common versus chromosome-specific
effects. Aim 2 will use a barcoded plasmid over-expression library to identify genes that complement
aneuploid defects along the progression to quiescence. Integrating Aim 1 and 2 results will define a temporal
map of genes and processes defective in aneuploid yeast strains and involved in quiescence. It will also point
to the upstream defect(s) directly caused by chromosome duplication, whose further study will expand our
understanding of aneuplodiy Aim 3 will use genomic, proteomic, single-cell and single-molecule analysis to
define and characterize the “Ssd1 Q granule”, a phase separated granule containing the RNA-binding protein
Ssd1, which we previously showed is fundamental for aneuploidy tolerance in healthy yeast. Since many
mechanisms in yeast are conserved in higher organisms including humans, this project will expand our basic
understand of aneuploidy and have far-reaching impact relevant for multiple human diseases."
10875535,"Although CD4 T cells are essential for immunity to tuberculosis (TB), the features of CD4 T cells that provide
protective immunity are not well understood. This knowledge gap is due in part to limited knowledge of the M.
tuberculosis (Mtb) antigens that induce protective immune responses. In other pathogens, immune recognition
of some antigens provides protection, while recognition of other antigens does not. Likewise in other pathogens,
the antigenic targets of protective immunity undergo diversifying evolutionary selection to generate antigenic
variation and escape immune recognition. We hypothesized that these principles apply to Mtb, and in earlier
studies we made the unexpected discovery that the commonly-studied antigenic targets of human T cells
(epitopes) in Mtb are hyperconserved; they are the most conserved elements of the Mtb genome. We then
sought to find exceptions, and combined comparative genomics of phylogenetically diverse strains of Mtb with
experimental immunology. This led to our discovery of seven novel Mtb antigens (that we term Mtb Rare Variable
Antigens; RVA) that are recognized by human T cells and exhibit evidence of evolutionary diversifying selection.
Together, these results suggest that human T cell recognition of RVA is detrimental to Mtb and that recognition
of conserved 'classical' Mtb antigens is not detrimental to Mtb. We recently studied CD4 T cells from healthy
Quantiferon-TB positive (QFT+) recent close contacts of infectious cases of TB, and discovered that RVA induce
CD4 T cells characterized by dominant interleukin 17 responses and expression of the lineage-defining
transcription factor RORγt, in contrast to CD4 T cells that recognize classical Mtb antigens and exhibit interferon
gamma responses and expression of T-bet. These results indicate that human CD4 T cells that recognize RVA
are functionally distinct from those that recognize conserved antigens, and we hypothesize that T cells that
recognize RVA provide protection against active TB, as indicated by their evolutionary selection. In this project,
we will use innovative assays to intensively characterize CD4 T cells from QFT+ adults by comparing the features
of CD4 T cells that recognize RVA versus classical Mtb antigens. We will compare their functional responses,
longitudinal memory phenotypes, and extent of differentiation. We will also employ an innovative new platform
developed by our team, using DNA barcoded peptide epitopes and next generation sequencing to test the
hypothesis that associations between CD4 T cell antigen specificity and certain functional responses are
widespread in Mtb. To determine the significance of RVA in protective immunity to TB, we will compare CD4 T
cells that recognize RVA vs classical Mtb antigens in adults with active TB and those with 'controlled' (or latent)
TB. We will also test the hypothesis that defects in RVA-specific CD4 T cells are primary and do not reverse with
treatment of active TB. The long term objective of this project is to inform development of TB vaccines that
prevent progression to active TB disease, the form that causes human morbidity and mortality, and the form that
is responsible for TB transmission."

Though the majority of the military is composed of non-Hispanic white men, the number of racial/ethnic
minority and women veterans has steadily increased in recent years. African-American/Black and Hispanic
veterans make up the largest proportion of the minority veteran population (about 50% and 30% of minority
veterans, respectively) and the number of women veterans, especially racial/ethnic minority women, is
expected to grow. Noted differences in alcohol use and behavioral health symptoms of PTSD and depression,
as well as behavioral health care access, have been reported for post-9/11 African-American/Black, Hispanic
veterans, and women veterans. However, research on disparities in veterans’ behavioral health care service
utilization and behavioral health symptomology primarily focuses on veterans’ use of VA facilities, therefore
missing 50% of veterans not receiving VA care. Unfortunately, there is limited research on the associations
between perceived discrimination and quality of behavioral health care or behavioral health care access
among racial/ethnic minority and women veterans who receive care outside of the VA system. Further, the
studies that do exist on disparities among veterans tend to be cross-sectional and they limit their examination
of disparities to individual factors only and do not incorporate larger environmental factors. Thus, the current
study seeks to extend prior work by recruiting 2,000 non-VA attending veterans with 4 years of follow up (bi
annual assessments). First, in an attempt to better understand veterans’ experiences of discrimination, 65
veterans will be recruited for in depth qualitative interviews. Results of these interviews will inform (not
determine) measurement in the larger study. Once completed, recruitment will begin for the longitudinal cohort.
We will oversample for racial/ethnic minority veterans (70% of the total recruited sample; n =1,400) and women
veterans (40% of both racial/ethnic minority and non-Hispanic white recruited veterans; n = 800). Outcome
data will be collected on behavioral health symptoms, including alcohol use/disorder, PTSD, and depression,
as well as behavioral health care access (alcohol use treatment receipt, preparatory behaviors, attitudes about
treatment). Experiences of racial discrimination and sexism (e.g., dignity denial, microaggressions, gender
discrimination, sexual harassment, health care discrimination) as well as minority based and military specific
stressors will be collected each wave. In addition to individual level data, we will use publicly available datasets
(e.g., Census) to gather data on neighborhood deprivation, poverty, income inequality, segregation,
neighborhood violence, distance to health care facilities, and liquor/alcohol outlets. We will use machine
learning models that incorporate all hypothesized predictors across both individual and environmental domains
to determine which factors are most important in predicting behavioral health symptoms, care receipt, and
attitudes, and the valence of individual predictor effects on outcomes. The latter can provide a rank order of
importance of predictors to help guide future prevention, intervention, and policy efforts."

Older adults in rural communities experience disparities in food and nutrition security and cardiovascular
disease outcomes. Enhancing access to healthy food through the emergency food system (food pantries, food
banks, and other direct food aid organizations) has the potential to improve dietary intake for low-income older
adults, enhance food and nutrition security, and serve as a prevention measure for cardiovascular diseases,
but this resource is underutilized by older adults. Thus, aligned with the Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition
Research’s focus on promotion of healthy aging through nutrition, research is critically needed to understand
how to effectively encourage older adults to use the emergency food system. In the proposed project, Dr.
Brady, a mixed-methods researcher, will collaboratively work with stakeholders in the emergency food system
and older adults to co-produce research on barriers and facilitators to access and develop an intervention to
connect older adults to food pantries in their communities. With a diverse mentorship team and the resources
available through the University of Minnesota, this Pathway to Independence Award will support Dr. Brady in
filling critical gaps in his training in community engaged research, the intervention development process from
conception to dissemination, and dietary assessment to begin his career as an independent investigator
working with communities to co-produce solutions to food and nutrition security and diet-related chronic
disease. To prepare for this role, Dr. Brady will complete a comprehensive training plan including coursework,
mentorship, engagement, and research in (1) applied expertise in community-engaged research, (2)
intervention development, testing, implementation, and dissemination, and (3) dietary and nutrition assessment
methods. This training will prepare Dr. Brady to conduct the proposed research. During the mentored K99
phase, he will identify barriers and facilitators to emergency food access for older adults in rural communities in
a mixed methods study using a community engaged approach (Aim 1). In the independent R00 phase, Dr.
Brady will use human centered design approaches to co-develop intervention strategies to increase access to
emergency foods with older adults and stakeholders in the emergency food system (Aim 2). Finally, he will test
this intervention in a preliminary study to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and potential to improve food and
nutrition security, dietary intake and cardiovascular disease outcomes (Aim 3). The findings from this proposed
research will be used as the foundation for an intervention study examining the effectiveness of these
strategies to improve dietary intake and cardiovascular disease outcomes through enhancing food and nutrition
security and facilitate Dr. Brady’s transition to a successful, independent research career."

Type 2 Diabetes and its precursor insulin resistance (IR) continue to rise and drive cardiovascular complications
worldwide. The mechanisms underlying IR remain incompletely understood. Epidemiological studies have
consistently revealed a signature of elevated plasma branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) in patients with
diabetes or IR, as well as subjects who will go on to develop IR. Mouse studies in laboratories worldwide have
shown that systemic suppression of BCAA catabolism worsens IR, while systemic activation of BCAA catabolism
(most often with BT2, a specific inhibitor of BCKDK, which in turn inhibits BCKDH, the rate-limiting step of BCAA
catabolism) improves IR. There is thus strong interest in targeting this pathway, and multiple pharmaceutical
companies are developing novel BT2-based molecule series. Despite these efforts, how systemic activation of
BCAA catabolism improves IR remains surprisingly unknown. In our search for potential mechanisms, we
discovered that BT2 promotes vasodilation and lowers blood pressure, and that it does so independently of nitric
oxide (NO) production by endothelial cells, suggesting that BT2 acts on smooth muscle cells (SMCs) instead.
Substantial literature indicates that insulin-stimulated vasodilation contributes to glucose uptake, although how
insulin promotes vasodilation remains incompletely understood. These observations and additional preliminary
data have led us to the hypothesis that insulin promotes BCAA catabolism in SMCs, in turn promoting
vasodilation and glucose tolerance, thereby explaining the metabolic benefits of systemic activation of BCAA
catabolism. We will test this hypothesis with novel genetic murine models; with state-of-the-art vascular
physiology assays; with hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps; and with human studies to test the impact of this
pathway on human vascular tone and reactivity. These highly focused studies will elucidate the role of BCAA
catabolism in regulating vascular reactivity and glucose tolerance, including human studies."
10887643,"Project Summary
 Most bladder cancer (BC) patients are diagnosed at an early stage. More than 80% of cases are non-muscle
invasive BC (NMIBC). The standard treatment involves removing the tumors surgically, followed by intravesical
immunotherapy, bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), or intravesical chemotherapy (ITC) to eradicate residual
cancer cells. This involves direct instillation of the BCG or drug solution into the bladder via a catheter. However,
the cancer recurrence rate is still unacceptably high (50-80%). On the other hand, there is a growing interest in
preserving the bladders of muscle invasive BC (MIBC) patients who are ineligible for radical cystectomy with
ITC. BCG and ITC have limitations. The treatments are local. The drug solution is unable to reach tumors located
in the upper urinary tract. Patients often need to void shortly after drug administration. The catheterization
procedure is invasive, which can potentially cause infection and urinary symptoms, resulting in poor patient
compliance. Currently, there is also a shortage of BCG. The goal of this project is to develop an approach to
counter the significant drug delivery obstacles of BC therapy to improve treatment and survival outcomes. A
peptide’s rapid renal clearance can be advantageous for directing treatments to the urinary system (URS). We
propose a bio-inert peptide (Bdd) to overcome the drug-delivery barriers. Bdd can be given intravenously rather
than intravesically. The use of Bdd as a carrier was shown to promote drugs, such as mertansine (DM1) and
doxorubicin (DOX), to be eliminated exclusively via renal clearance, with minimal—if not undetectable—
deposition in major organs. We hypothesize that this platform, used as an alternative to ITC, will offer an urgently
needed treatment that is more complete and effective. The advantages of such a urinary drug disposing (UDD)
system include: (1) continuous drug flow throughout the entire URS, (2) prolongation of bladder-dwelling time
(treatment duration), and (3) minimally invasive application. If successful, this approach will also avoid
catheterization, improve patient quality of life, and reduce hospitalization costs. Our Specific Aims will focus on
preclinical and translational studies to: (Aim 1) investigate the desired physicochemical properties (including
functional group, length, and surface charges) and administration parameters (infusion rate and volume) of a
newly developed Bdd analogue, Bds, with an improved UDD property, for precision drug delivery to the URS;
and (Aim 2) evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and anatomic flexibility of a DM1-Bds conjugate for BC treatment.
We will assess DM1-Bds alone or in combination with pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor approved
by the Food and Drug Administration, for treating both NMIBC and MIBC. Immune profiling will address the anti-
tumor activities. This information will be crucial for significantly improving treatment outcomes. With additional
advancements, we also foresee our UDD approach will be unusually transposable and useful for treating other
diseases (e.g., bladder infections), simply by replacing the drugs attached to the peptide sequence with
antibiotics."

 Voice disorders affect millions of Americans at substantive economic cost. Decisions regarding
treatment are often primarily based on dichotomous thinking: mucosal injury versus muscle dysfunction.
However, laryngeal muscle dysfunction often accompanies laryngeal mucosal pathologies and may be both
causative and reactive. This proposal is an innovative combination of in vivo and in vitro methodologies to
investigate the effect of both transient and persistent vocal fold mucosal injury on the underlying function,
structure, and mechanistic response of the thyroarytenoid muscle, the primary muscle of the vocal fold. The
long-term goal of this research is to provide mechanistic insight regarding the complex interactions between
the mucosal and muscular vocal fold layers, thereby contributing to a shift in clinical schema and classification
of voice disorders, but more importantly, lead to the development of novel, targeted therapeutic strategies for
the millions of patients with voice-related disability. The central hypothesis of this work is injury to the vocal
folds elicits complex interactions between the vocal fold mucosa and underlying muscle, which consequently
results in altered laryngeal muscle structure and function.
 The proposed research has two specific aims. Aim 1 is to determine functional, structural, and
mechanistic laryngeal muscle responses to vocal fold injury in an established in vivo rodent model. Two depths
of vocal fold injuries, shallow injury of the mucosa only or deep injury of the mucosa and underlying muscle,
will be created in male and female rats to determine the time course of vocal fold injury on a) muscle function
via analysis of ultrasonic vocalization acoustic complexity, b) mechanistic response of the muscle via
proteomic analysis, and c) changes in specific protein levels identified in the big-data proteomic interrogation.
Injury depths will be confirmed via muscle histology. Aim 2 is to characterize and quantify signaling between
fibroblasts and myoblasts as well as inflammatory cells from the vocal folds in vitro under basal and stimulated
(e.g., injured) conditions. In vitro experimentation will examine the effects of fibrotic and inflammatory
mediators on fibroblasts from the vocal fold lamina propria and myoblasts from intrinsic laryngeal muscle to
interrogate unique interactions between the two cell types via co-culture and conditioned media experiments.
These data will provide critical mechanistic and translational insight regarding the cycle of dysphonia and
provide potential targets for pharmacological interventions.
 The proposed research is significant because this foundational mechanistic insight will optimize
treatments for millions of patients with voice-related disability. The proposal is conceptually innovative,
proposes novel, cutting-edge methodologies, and coalesces expertise across multiple laboratories and
specialties."

10917348,"Project Summary (Abstract)
 Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a public health concern given their environmental
persistence, long biological half-life in humans, and related health effects. Exposure to PFAS during gestation,
infancy, and childhood is associated with low birth weight, preeclampsia, hypothyroidism, reduced vaccine
response, and metabolic alterations. The phase out of legacy PFAS, most prominently perfluorooctanoic acid
and (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), has led to increased manufacturing of understudied PFAS,
which contain shorter C-F chain lengths or branched structures. However, limited information is available
regarding the extent of exposure and toxicity of these understudied PFAS. Thus, there is a critical need to
understand the contribution of understudied, or replacement, PFAS to total PFAS exposure. This proposal will
fill gaps in our knowledge of human exposure to understudied PFAS during developmentally sensitive periods
of life using a combination of targeted and untargeted analytical methods in two cohorts. The central hypothesis
will be tested and our overall objectives will be accomplished by pursuing two specific aims: (1) Characterize the
relations of EOF, legacy PFAS, and understudied PFAS within and between maternal serum, placenta, and cord
blood samples and (2) Quantify EOF, legacy PFAS, and understudied PFAS levels in breastmilk and formula
and determine their contribution to infant serum EOF, legacy PFAS and understudied PFAS levels.
Characterizing the magnitude of exposure to understudied, replacement PFAS is a critical need in the risk
assessment process and will help guide future studies in the selection of candidate PFAS to examine.
Furthermore, understanding how milk and formula contribute to infant PFAS body burden can help inform
breastfeeding guidance in exposed populations. This career development award will extend the candidate’s prior
training and research experience in environmental engineering and environmental analytical chemistry by
providing expert mentoring and protected time to 1) gain experiential learning in study design for epidemiological
and chemical exposure research, 2) develop expertise in untargeted PFAS analysis, 3) acquire proficiency in
advanced statistical data analysis, and 4) develop professional and leadership skills. Her primary mentor Dr.
Joseph Braun (epidemiology, chemical exposure), along with members of her mentoring team Dr. Krystal Pollitt
(untargeted PFAS analysis) and Dr. Shelley Liu (statistics), will provide the needed mentoring for the candidate
to establish a productive independent research program. This will be achieved through hands-on training that
includes coursework, conferences, grant development, scientific communication, and career development skills.
Upon successful completion of the training portion of this grant, it is expected that Dr. Manz will be successful
as an independent investigator and prepared to establish a R01 funded research program."
10726572,"Human fibrotic disorders affect many organ systems including heart, blood vessels, kidney, liver and lung,
accounting for excessive disease burden in the U.S., including among our Veterans Administration (VA) patient
population. The most common fibrotic lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is characterized by
excessive scar tissue formation and irreversible destruction of the lung parenchyma, resulting in gas-exchange
abnormalities and ultimately respiratory failure. Aging is strongest risk factor for IPF; however, the
cellular/molecular mechanisms that account for the age-associated predilection to fibrotic disease are only
beginning to be explored. Improved understanding of the role of aging in this disease will aid in the
development of novel therapies with greater clinical efficacy.
 In support of this VA Merit Award renewal application, we have made several recent contributions to our
understanding of aging mechanisms in lung injury and repair mechanisms. Human subjects with IPF express
low levels of the mitochondrial sirtuin, SIRT3, in myofibroblastic foci and in ex-vivo fibroblasts isolated from IPF
lungs. This down-regulation of SIRT3 is replicated in an aging model of non-resolving fibrosis in mice; while
fibrosis in young mice largely resolves over 2-4 months post-bleomycin, aged mice manifest persistent fibrosis.
Our data indicate that this capacity for fibrosis resolution in young mice is associated with recovery of SIRT3
levels in the late reparative phase of lung injury, while this is absent in aged mice. However, re-constitution of
SIRT3 (via lung-targeted non-viral cDNA plasmid delivery) restores the capacity for fibrosis resolution in aged
mice. This protective effect is associated with in-vivo activation of FoxO3a, evidenced by higher levels of
nuclear FoxO3a. Both cellular senescence and the pro-fibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-
β1) induce a down-regulation of SIRT3 and FoxO3a, events that lead to mitochondrial dysfunction,
senescence and apoptosis resistance of lung fibroblasts. Our studies also support the possibility that
modulation of SIRT3 in alveolar macrophages regulates fibroblast activation of FoxO3a by a paracrine
mechanism. Additionally, the histone acetyltransferases, p300 and cyclic AMP-response element binding
protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), are implicated in the epigenetic down-regulation of SIRT3 by TGF-β1
and cellular senescence. Impaired activation of the SIRT3-FoxO3a signaling axis promotes a senescent and
apoptosis-resistant fibroblast phenotype, which drives persistent/non-resolving fibrosis.
 The central hypothesis to be tested in this grant proposal is that persistent/non-resolving fibrosis
associated with aging is mediated by impaired activation of Foxo3a in fibroblasts, either by SIRT3 deficiency in
fibroblasts themselves or by macrophage-derived paracrine mechanisms, contributes to mitochondrial
dysfunction, senescence and apoptosis resistance of lung fibroblasts.
 Our specific aims are to: (1) elucidate p300/CBP-dependent epigenetic regulation of SIRT3 in lung
fibroblasts and alveolar macrophages that mediate pro-resolution phenotypes; (2) investigate the role of the
SIRT3-FoxO3a signaling axis in restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics and apoptosis susceptibility to
senescent/fibrotic lung fibroblasts; and (3) determine whether reconstitution of SIRT3 by
genetic/pharmacologic approaches promotes fibrosis resolution in aged mice via the activation of FoxO3a in
lung fibroblasts. The completion of the Aims in this proposal will: (a) uncover epigenetic mechanisms that
control SIRT3 expression with cellular senescence/aging; (b) provide mechanistic insights into the role of
SIRT3-FoxO3a signaling in the regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics and cellular plasticity/fate; and (c)
elucidate macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk and SIRT3 regulation of pro-resolving macrophages; and (d) provide
proof-of-concept that activation of the SIRT3-FoxO3a signaling pathway promotes fibrosis resolution, leading
to new therapeutic approaches for progressive lung diseases."
10726573,"Summary
Atherosclerosis contributes significantly to cardiac related morbidity and mortality in the aging population of
veterans. Plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) and its precursor very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) are two
atherogenic lipoproteins. LDL initiates atherosclerosis through its retention in the subendothelial space of
arterial walls. Statin-mediated LDL lowering is now the mainstay of cardiovascular disease treatment.
However, despite the efficacy, there are many instances of unresponsiveness and intolerance. There is thus
an urgent need for additional approaches for lowering plasma LDL, preferably acting synergistically with
statins. Blocking liver VLDL secretion and promoting LDL clearance have long been recognized as an
effective LDL lowering strategies. Those are different from the use of statins. It is known for a long time that
plasma phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) level is a better predictor for human atherosclerosis. However, how
to regulate PE and what is the mechanism linking PE with atherosclerosis are not quite understood. PE is
one of the important lipid components on VLDL and LDL, and its level influences the development of
atherogenesis in animal models. Thus, study PE regulation may provide an important clue for lowering
VLDL and LDL, and for a new treatment of human atherosclerosis.
 Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) gene family has three members: SMS1 and SMS2 have SM
synthase activity, while SMS-related protein (SMSr) has no SM synthase activity but has ceramide
phosphorylethanolamine (CPE) synthase activity in test tubes. Although SMSr is ubiquitously expressed in
all tested tissues, the CPE levels in most of mammalian tissues or cells are undetectable under chow or
high fat/cholesterol diets. Therefore, SMSr is not a functional CPE synthase in vivo and its real biological
function need to be elucidated. From the CPE synthase reaction, we notice that SMSr should have a
potential PE-PLC activity, i.e. hydrolyzing PE into diacylglycerol and phosphorylethanolamine, which could
be involved in tissue PE steady state regulation. Based on preliminary results of this study, we then
hypothesize that SMSr is a functional PE-PLC in vivo. Given the fact that PE levels are involved in VLDL
production, LDL clearance, and the development of atherosclerosis, SMSr/PE-PLC should be a novel and
promising target for lowering LDL. We have three specific aims: 1. Investigate whether SMSr is a
functional PE-PLC. 2. Evaluate the effects of blocking SMSr/PE-PLC on VLDL production and LDL
clearance. 3. Examine the role of SMSr/PE-PLC deficiency in the development of atherosclerosis. Insights
gained from the proposed studies will allow us to evaluate SMSr/PE-PLC as a target for preventing and
treating human atherosclerosis."

No model organism has contributed more than the laboratory mouse to improving human health. Many genetic
factors and therapies for human diseases were initially discovered or characterized in mice, before they were
transitioned to human use.
Large-scale efforts are underway to integrate recent advances in artificial
intelligence (AI) into human healthcare, but very few AI advances have been used for analysis of the data
produced using the model organism that has formed the foundation for many healthcare innovations. We
recently developed an AI-based computational pipeline that could identify causative genetic factors for murine
genetic models of human biomedical traits and diseases. After assessing the strength of allelic associations
with the phenotypic response pattern exhibited by the inbred strains; this AI pipeline uses a machine-learning
trained method to analyze 29M published papers and assess candidate gene-phenotype relationships; and the
information obtained from assessment of their protein-protein interaction network and protein sequence
features of the candidate genes are also incorporated into the graph neural network-based analysis.
This project will produce a markedly enhanced AI pipeline (AIv2) that will greatly accelerate the pace of genetic
discovery using murine genetic models. First, long read genomic sequencing (LRS) and computational tools
are used to produce a more complete map of the pattern of genetic variation among the inbred strains, which
also includes alleles for two major types of genetic variation (structural variants, tandem repeats), which are
poorly characterized using conventional sequencing methods. Second, we develop two additional
computational tools for the AI, which facilitate candidate gene prioritization through the evaluation of: (i) the
phenotypes exhibited by 8200 mouse lines with individual gene knockouts (KOs); and (ii) the results of 5700
human GWAS covering many biomedical phenotypes to determine if alleles within the human homologues of
candidate murine genes affect an analyzed trait. The ability of AIv2 to accelerate genetic discovery will be
demonstrated by using it to identify new genetic factors through analysis of a public database with >10,307
datasets, which measure biomedical or disease-related responses in panels of inbred strains. Since it is critical
to experimentally confirm some of the computational findings, genetic factors for two murine models of human
diseases that are major public health problems (cancer, diabetes/obesity), which were identified by the AI
pipeline, will be experimentally validated. CRISPR engineering is used to revert the causative mutation(s) to
wildtype on the genetic background of the strain exhibiting the disease phenotype, and the genome engineered
mice are analyzed to assess the contribution of the genetic factor to the disease phenotype."
10906177,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The widespread availability of portable Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners that can be
transported to the bedside could have a tremendous impact for critical care and general clinical care in low-
resource settings. To achieve truly portable, point-of-care operation, a low magnetic field strength (<0.1 T) is
considered a prerequisite for both size requirements and safety considerations. However, the main limitation of
low-field MRI is the associated low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio. The low SNR of these systems results in
significantly inferior image quality compared to conventional MRI. While high SNR is not always necessary to
detect pathology, there may be a high risk of missed findings and misdiagnosis. This is a significant issue that
currently defrays the use of low-field MRI and could ultimately limit the widescale adoption and scale-up of
portable accessible MRI technology.
 One non-invasive method for improving the sensitivity of the MR measurement, is to maximize the receiver
coil sensitivity. Our proposal attempts to achieve this with stretchable receiver caps for brain imaging. The
stretchable coils will adapt to each subject to provide the highest filling factor for the coil and attempt to achieve
body-noise dominance. Instead of using a lossy stretchable conductor, we will use flexible, strategically draped
litz wire on a stretchable cap to construct the single channel receiver coil. The inductance of the coil will
change with each subject due to the change-able diameter and shape. Therefore, we will implement an
external tuning and matching box for “autotuning” the coil. The autotuning system will make use of a compact
PC-controlled vector network analyzer (VNA) to monitor the S-parameters of the coil and output appropriate
voltages to voltage-controlled capacitors (varactor diodes) for adjustable tuning/matching. Our end goal is to
create the optimal brain imaging coil for each individual subject (through adapting the shape and
tuning/matching) with the ultimate goal of improving portable MRI image quality and clinical utility."

The proposed research aims to investigate the role of endolysosomal damage in ischemic brain injury. Recently,
significant progress has been made in understanding the endolysosomal system, previously known as the
lysosomal system. This endolysosomal system now includes three basic structures: (i) late endosome (LE), (ii)
lysosome (L), and (iii) endolysosome/autolysosome (EL/AL). The LE receives incoming endolysosomal proteins
(e.g., intraluminal cathepsins and structural proteins) from the Golgi apparatus and waste cargos from the
endocytic and autophagic pathways. Although the LE contains both cathepsins and waste cargos, the LE’s
cathepsins cannot efficiently degrade these waste cargos due to LE’s less acidic pH (6.0). The LE must fuse
with the more acidic lysosome (L) (pH 4.0-4.5) to become a hybrid endolysosome (EL) to efficiently degrade
these waste cargos. This rate-limiting LE-to-L fusion step is mediated by the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive
factor ATPase (NSF)-dependent machinery. Our recent studies show that brain ischemia leads to NSF
deficiency in neurons destined to die. We generated a neuron-specific NSF deficient mouse line to understand
the role of NSF deficiency in the endolysosomal damage observed after both global and focal brain ischemia. In
NSF-deficient mice (absence of ischemia), there is a prominent buildup of abnormal “multi-aggregated”
endolysosomal structures, followed by autonomous neuronal death. This phenotype replicates the same
neuropathological features observed in the wildtype (wt) littermates after both global and focal brain ischemia.
Neuronal cathepsin B (CTSB) release is another key neuropathological feature observed in both our NSF-
deficient mice without ischemia and the wt littermates after both global and focal brain ischemia. Most cathepsins
have low or no activity at neutral pH, but CTSB uniquely exhibits endopeptidase activity at neutral pH. CTSB is
the most dominant cathepsin in neurons. Our recent studies further show that conventional (all tissue) CTSB
knockout (KO) in mice significantly protects the brain in a mouse focal brain ischemia model. Based on these new
results, we hypothesize that post-ischemic NSF deficiency leads to endolysosomal damage and causes a large
quantity release of its contents, e.g., CTSB, into the cytoplasm and extracellular space. This large quantity
release of CTSB leads to ischemic brain injury. We will test this novel hypothesis by investigating: (i) how post-
ischemic NSF deficiency leads to endolysosomal damage using neuron-specific NSF deficient mice without brain
ischemia and their littermates subjected to brain ischemia (Aim 1); (ii) if NSF overexpression in transgenic (tg)
mice can reduce both endolysosomal damage and brain ischemic injury (Aim 2); (iii) whether and how neuronal
CTSB release leads to ischemic brain injury using neuron-specific CTSB KO mice (Aim 3); and (iv) the role of
microglial and macrophage CTSB in prolonged post-ischemic inflammation using microglia and macrophage-
specific CTSB KO mice (Aim 4). These studies will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics that target
endolysosomal damage and potentially restores NSF activity after brain ischemia."

Compromised placental function is highly associated with abnormal fetal brain development, and later with
neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, epilepsy, and schizophrenia, but the causal mechanisms
remain largely unknown. The prevalence of these neurodevelopmental disorders is increased in those born
preterm or born after pregnancies with evidence of poor placental function. Altered cortical GABAergic signaling
has been implicated in many neurodevelopmental disorders, but until recently the tools to examine the
relationship between placental dysfunction, altered cortical development and GABAergic signaling did
not exist. In the initial funding period of this proposal, we validated and used our novel mouse model to
directly demonstrate for the first time that a key placental hormone-- allopregnanolone (ALLO)-- is needed
for normal brain development and that its loss contributes to long-term neurological dysfunction. ALLO is a
potent GABAergic neurosteroid derived from progesterone that is made predominantly by the placenta in
both rodent and human late gestation, resulting in high fetal brain concentrations of placentally-derived
ALLO. Deleting the gene encoding the ALLO synthesis enzyme only from the placenta resulted in decrease in
gestational ALLO exposure and produced global, yet sex-linked and regionally-specific, changes
neuroanatomy and behavior. Reduced placental ALLO production impaired prenatal somatosensory
corticogenesis and upper layer pyramidal neurons were permanently decreased, predominantly in female
offspring, who also showed impaired somatosensory behavior. Molecular analyses of human postmortem
brain specimens suggested similarities between mouse placental ALLO insufficiency and human preterm
cortical development. Building on these published findings and on preliminary data showing that placental
ALLO loss is associated with decreased cortical GABAergic interneuron density, altered GABA system-related
gene expression, and changes in spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents in mouse somatosensory cortex,
we propose a new series of experiments in our mouse model to test the hypotheses that placental ALLO
loss (1) disrupts the production and survival of specific cortical interneuron subclasses and (2) permanently
alters the cortical excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance. We will then extend our analysis using our recently
established in vitro brain organoid system to (3) define dosage and timing of ALLO exposure and withdrawal
across multiple stages of human cortical interneuron development. Together, these next studies will
elucidate new mechanisms by which placental hormones, including ALLO, can shape GABAergic cortical
development. This work is starting to fundamentally change our understanding of developmental brain disorders
and the placenta’s role in shaping long-term neurological outcomes and moves us closer to use of novel
therapies based on placental hormones to prevent or ameliorate neurodevelopmental impairments."

 Cancer cachexia (CC) is characterized by unintentional weight loss secondary to adipose and skeletal
muscle tissue wasting. It results from a complex interaction between the tumor and host, where tumor released
factors reprogram peripheral organ and tissue metabolism to cause wasting. CC affects a majority of patients
with lung, pancreatic, and gastrointestinal cancer, in addition to patients with other advanced stage cancers,
and is associated with increased treatment-related toxicity, poor response to chemo- and immunotherapy and
is estimated to cause ~20% of all cancer-related deaths. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer
worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. A majority of lung cancer patients exhibit signs of
CC at diagnosis, with up to 75% experiencing tissue wasting during treatment. Oncogenic KRAS mutations
increase the risk for CC and are found in many aggressive cancers that are prone to CC, including pancreatic,
gastrointestinal and lung cancer. In fact, a large majority of lung adenocarcinomas show evidence for elevated
Ras pathway activation (84%). Studies have described murine lung cancer models with mutated Kras that
develop CC, but these models fail to reproduce the pathophysiology and time course of CC in human patients.
Thus, our goal is to develop and test mouse Kras driven lung cancer models that more accurately reproduce
the clinical condition to facilitate identification of pathoetiological mechanisms and to provide an experimental
system that enables testing of pharmacological and supportive care interventions over a more clinically
relevant time frame. This proposal builds on our strong preliminary results from lung club cell specific KrasG12D
mouse models characterizing the phenotypes and time course of CC initiation and progression. Based on our
preliminary data, we hypothesize that our KrasG12D lung adenocarcinoma model more closely mimics the
pathophysiology of human CC in its phenotypes and time course compared to a similar Kras driven mouse
model that aligns with the rapid time course of commonly used murine lung CC models. To develop this model
and test our hypotheses, we will use a combination of genetically engineered mouse models and in vitro
models consisting of tumor organoids developed from these animals, along with skeletal muscle and adipose
cell cultures. Results from our studies will advance the field by providing novel in vivo and in vitro models to
study the pathophysiology of CC and to test therapeutic interventions. Collectively, these tools and knowledge
will inform translation of basic science discoveries into more effective treatments for CC in patients."

Sexual and gender minorities (SGM), defined here as individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and/or another identity, continue to be underrepresented in Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementia (ADRD) caregiving research. Estimates suggest at least 1 in 5 SGM adults in the
U.S. (nearly 1 million persons) are currently caregivers, with nearly half providing care to someone with ADRD.
Our previous research has found that SGM caregivers experience health disparities, including high levels of
caregiver stigma, depression, disability, victimization, discrimination, and stress (e.g., physical, emotional, and
financial strain). Given the critical contributions of informal caregivers to ADRD care and the changing nature of
caregiver dynamics, roles, and needs, it is crucial that measures relating to caregiving accurately reflect all
caregivers. This study proposes to enhance understanding of experiences, roles and dynamics for SGM ADRD
caregivers by identifying existing domains and developing new measures, testing and validating these
measures, and ensuring measures are inclusive and accurately capture caregiving constructs and experiences
of SGM ADRD caregivers. Guided by a community based participatory approach, we will leverage expertise of
advisory boards with knowledge of SGM ADRD and caregiving research. This mixed method study has three
specific aims. In Aim 1, we will identify and explore domains of ADRD caregiving for SGM ADRD caregivers
through focus groups (n=8) and in-depth interviews (n=40). These findings will inform Aim 2 and the
identification of key domains and subdomains. In Aim 2, we will develop and refine new measures of ADRD
caregiving for SGM ADRD caregivers through the use of a modified online Delphi method that will garner input
from advisory boards (community partners/researchers, n=40) with expertise in ADRD caregiving measures
and the lived experiences of SGM and non-SGM ADRD caregivers. To ensure content validity of the new
ADRD measures, they will be pretested and refined based on initial testing (n=40) and cognitive interviews
(n=20) with SGM and non-SGM caregivers. In Aim 3, we will then test the new and existing measures of ADRD
caregiving among a heterogeneous sample of SGM (n=250) and non-SGM ADRD caregivers (n=250). After
evaluating the dimensionality structure of each item pool for a given domain and removing misfitting items, we
will use item response theory (IRT) and an IRT-based model fit to further evaluate for item misfit. Finally, the
resulting measures will be evaluated within an independent sample of SGM (n=125) and non-SGM (n=125)
caregivers. This study’s iterative process will allow for the development of 6 to 8 new or modified caregiving
measures that can help to improve access to supports and services of SGM ADRD caregivers, and ensure that
future studies and intervention efforts can meet the needs of all ADRD caregivers and their care recipients."

Despite comprising nearly 20% of the United States population and being at increased risk for Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), Hispanics/Latinos (H/Ls) comprise less than 10% of AD/ADRD
research samples and only about 1% of AD/ADRD NIH-funded clinical trials. H/Ls are disproportionately more
likely than non-H/Ls to have AD/ADRD due to several potential factors including longer lifespans;
cardiovascular disease and related risk factors like hypertension; lower socioeconomic resources, related
stress, and reduced access to healthcare– products of historic and systemic racism against communities of
color. Limited representation in research clearly impacts our ability to characterize AD/ADRD clinical
phenotypes as well as our ability to develop ethno-racially/culturally appropriate assessments and treatments.
There is a critical need for a precision engagement of culturally and linguistically diverse individuals, such as
H/Ls, for inclusion in AD/ADRD precision medicine research and establishment of sustainable, shareable, and
heterogeneous data resources.
The proposed work rests on the central hypothesis that inclusion of culturally and linguistically diverse
individuals in AD/ADRD research requires the use of tailored approaches responsive to the needs and values
of the communities we seek to include (precision engagement). Given the known systemic and institutional
barriers that have historically excluded H/Ls from participating in AD/ADRD research, the proposed work
applies a mixed method-, multi-disciplinary, precision engagement approach that is “straight-to-consumer,”
community based, and culturally responsive. We will leverage resources from our Engaging Communities of
Hispanics/Latinos for Aging Research (ECHAR) Network, which has established relationships with community
partners in three cities with dense H/L populations (Houston, TX; Las Vegas, NV; Denver, CO) to identify
community relevant language and ways to communicate AD/ADRD messaging to other H/Ls.
Targeting the stated goal, the proposed work aims to (1) refine and (2) disseminate a culturally responsive
multimedia “toolkit” for use in engaging and recruiting Hispanic/Latino adults into AD/ADRD research,
monitoring its reach and uptake via various methods, including a phone-based risk calculator. Along these
lines, we aim to develop a risk registry that we will leverage for (3) collection of behavioral data and (4) blood
specimens that will allow us the workflow and pilot data necessary to begin characterizing the relationships of
these variables in a diverse sample of H/Ls.
By the end of the proposed project, we expect to have an evidence based, community engaged, culturally
responsive engagement toolkit and risk registry for engaging Hispanic/Latino individuals into AD/ADRD
research. Moreover, we expect to have a well-characterized registry of H/Ls and data repository available for
additional research studies on causal pathways related to AD/ADRD."
10740895,"Summer Research Experiences in Neuroscience (SREN), developed and led by the Science & Health Education Partnership (SEP) at UC San Francisco (UCSF), will annually support 10 public high school students, the majority from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, in neuroscience research internships. Interns’ research projects will focus on deepening our understanding of the brain and nervous system in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease. UCSF’s world-renowned departments of Neurology, Neurological Surgery, and Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases offer an ideal backdrop to develop interns’ ability to conduct rigorous scientific research. The specific aims for this project are to:1) develop students’ science skills, 2) build students’ awareness of neuroscience careers and identity as neuroscience researchers, 3) foster college readiness, and 4) disseminate our efforts broadly. This project leverages UCSF SEP’s experience coupling authentic research experiences with co-curricular supports to prepare students to matriculate to and thrive in college, ultimately to increase participation in neuroscience careers among students from backgrounds defined by the NIH as underrepresented in biomedical research. The short- and long-term impacts of SREN on its student cohort will be documented through surveys to track high school graduation, college matriculation, major selection and degree completion, as well as students’ self-reported gains in science confidence and researcher identity. Over the lifetime of the project, 50 students will be engaged in authentic neuroscience research projects and have the chance to leverage the support structures within SREN to propel themselves into a neuroscience career."
10895532,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 There is a compelling need to foster the development and research careers of clinician-scientist faculty at
accredited academic institutions that graduate complementary and integrative health (CIH) professionals. Well-
trained, well-resourced, diverse, and collaborative clinician scientists are essential to high-fidelity innovative
research of complementary and integrative interventions that can improve health outcomes. Clinician-scientist
faculty at CIH institutions are also in an optimal position to understand and help answer research questions
that are essential to advance the science of CIH. Further, their interaction with students may encourage some
to consider future careers as clinician scientists, and more broadly will expose all students to critical thinking
and allow them to be better future clinicians committed to staying current on the latest scientific evidence.
 The overarching goal of this application is to create a virtual resource center for REsearch Across
Complementary and Integrative Health (REACH) institutions. The purpose of this REACH Center is to provide
resources for collaboration across clinician-scientist faculty located at CIH clinical institutions. This REACH
Center will take advantage of a successful effort begun in 2020 by Drs Herman and Coulter, the RAND Center
for Collaborative Research in CIH (RAND Center). The purpose of the RAND Center was to initiate research
collaborations between 13 CIH clinical institutions in the US and Canada. At the core of this effort is a web-
based members-only platform built using user-centered design with input from member researchers. This
collaboration has been awarded 3 of 7 research proposals submitted, each funded by a different organization.
 While satisfaction with the current RAND Center is universally high, presidents of the 13 partnering
institutions agree that the advances of REACH, as outlined in these Specific Aims, would greatly enhance their
collective research success, and have expressed their full support for this application. These are the Aims:
Aim 1: Foster and enhance a virtual research community across the Center’s multi-disciplinary partners in
which collaborative research concepts can be incubated into successful grant submissions resulting in findings
which will improve symptom management and whole person health using CIH interventions.
Aim 2: Provide core research resources to Center members including biostatistical and clinical informatics
support, consultation on research design, grants administrative support, and collective software/datasets.
Aim 3: Facilitate research training and mentoring to improve grant applications and support the progression of
clinician-scientists into successful research careers.
Aim 4: Outreach for additional CIH clinical institution partnerships will occur throughout the support period.
 Achieving these Aims will increase research capacity within CIH clinical institutions, augment clinical
research training pipelines, improve research knowledge and skills within partnering institutions and facilitate
the creation of a research culture and the next generation of critically thinking CIH clinicians."
10740848,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Young Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (YB-GBMSM) encounter multilevel barriers
to engaging in HIV care, as a direct result of structural and interpersonal racism, homonegativity and HIV
stigma. These barriers lead to HIV disparities in which YB-GBMSM have high HIV prevalence and incidence,
but suboptimal rates of engagement across the HIV Care Continuum. Resilience at both the individual and
community levels can buffer the deleterious effects of stigma and discrimination on HIV care engagement. We
have previously developed a culturally-specific resilience-building intervention for YB-GBMSM living with HIV
called Brothers Building Brothers by Breaking Barriers (B6). B6 specifically targets intersectional identity
affirmation (an individual-level resilience factor) and social capital (a community-level resilience factor) as a
strategy for improving engagement in HIV care. The objective of this R34 application is to adapt B6, originally
developed as an in-person intervention, for telehealth delivery within the context of a community-based
organization (CBO). The rationale for the project is that telehealth delivery and CBO partnership will remove
barriers to participation and facilitate scalability and sustainability. Our study will be based in Atlanta, Georgia –
an HIV epicenter. This study will pursue three specific aims: (1) to adapt B6 for telehealth delivery, in
collaboration with YB-GBMSM, community advisors, and subject matter experts; (2) to conduct a pilot
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of tele-B6 among YB-GBMSM living
with HIV in Atlanta; and (3) to evaluate the process of implementing B6 within the context of our partner CBO.
For the first aim, we will use the ADAPT-ITT framework to convert B6 from an in-person to a telehealth
intervention (tele-B6). For the second aim, we will test tele-B6 with N=60 YB-GBMSM and examine feasibility
and acceptability of the intervention. We will also explore intervention impacts on social capital, identity
affirmation, and HIV care engagement. In the third aim, we will utilize the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research to examine the process of implementing tele-B6 within the structure of our partner
CBO. The proposed research is highly significant because of its potential to develop a culturally relevant,
scalable intervention for YB-GBMSM, a group who continues to be heavily and disproportionately impacted by
HIV."

This proposal builds on our past studies of the human DEK gene, which is amplified and overexpressed, and
thus implicated in many human cancer types including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
HNSCC is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide - with dismal outcomes. Identification of biomarkers
for early diagnosis and new drug targets remains imperative. DEK is a highly conserved protein that binds nucleic
acids and regulates diverse nuclear processes, including transcription. We have shown that DEK is an oncogene,
by reporting that DEK overexpression extends the life span of primary human keratinocytes, induces hyperplasia
in 3D models of epidermis, cooperates with classical oncogenes to stimulate keratinocyte transformation, and
promotes HPV+ and HPV– HNSCC and breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Our data also demonstrated
that DEK overexpression increases β-catenin activity, and this DEK-β-catenin axis is required and sufficient for
some cancer phenotypes.
 A major hurdle in neoplastic transformation is the ability of cells to meet high bioenergetic and biosynthetic
needs for sustained cancer cell growth. Recently, we reported that DEK overexpression increases transcription
of key enzymes in glycolysis, lactate fermentation and cholesterol synthesis, and accumulation of metabolites
that are glycolytic end products. However, it is not known whether β-catenin is required for DEK-driven metabolic
reprogramming, and we do not understand the role of glycolysis and cholesterol synthesis in DEK-driven cancer
phenotypes. Finally, in preliminary studies, we discovered that DEK is uniquely targeted to mitochondria, and
DEK overexpression stimulated cellular oxidative phosphorylation capacity. In the proposed 3 aims, we test 2
hypotheses. First, that DEK overexpression promotes HNSCC oncogenic phenotypes by 2 discrete pools of DEK
which drive metabolic deregulation, one nuclear (Aim1) and one mitochondrial (Aim2). Second, that targeting
either β-catenin, or vulnerable nodes of the metabolic signature is an effective strategy to prevent HNSCC
phenotypes. In partnership with an expert in stable isotope resolved metabolomics technologies, we will generate
an atom-resolved map of metabolic networks controlled by DEK overexpression, and will then use this map to
identify and validate novel metabolic flux vulnerabilities for drug targeting and diagnostic biomarkers (Aim3).
Taken together, the proposed experiments represent a significant first step towards innovative prevention and
treatment strategies to improve the outcomes of HNSCC via metabolic interventions."

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) causes significant morbidity and mortality; however, we still do not fully
understand how immune tolerance to red blood cells (RBCs) is established or broken. Given that RBCs are
required for life, are abundant, and have essential functions (e.g., tissue oxygenation), one would predict
stringent immune tolerance; however, tolerance failure occurs frequently. Indeed, 0.1% of healthy blood donors
and ~8% of hospitalized patients have detectable RBC autoantibodies. These autoantibodies can be clinically
significant, by inducing RBC clearance, hemolysis, antigen modulation, and increased risk for future AIHA or
cancer. Patients with AIHA present with pallor, fatigue, hemoglobinuria, splenomegaly, and/or life-threatening
hemolysis. Treatment strategies have variable success, with high relapse rates and mortality in ~11% of cases.
Supportive care using RBC transfusions is challenging as most autoantibodies recognize ubiquitous RBC
antigens; thus, virtually all donor units are crossmatch incompatible. The etiology of AIHA is generally unknown
and up to 50% of AIHA cases have no identifiable cause (“primary”). Secondary AIHA is frequently associated
with other autoimmune diseases and has been recently observed as a complication of checkpoint inhibitor
immunotherapies in the treatment of cancer. Thus, loss of tolerance to RBC autoantigens is an important medical
and scientific problem. To elucidate RBC tolerance mechanisms, we developed an innovative primary AIHA
murine model, which closely reflects human disease, a subset of mice develops age-onset hemolytic RBC
autoantibodies, anemia, splenomegaly, and reticulocytosis. Using this model, we pinpointed a 3-week
developmental timeframe during which RBC autoreactive recent thymic emigrants encounter RBC antigens and
become tolerized. Transcriptomic analysis identified novel pathways whose activity correlates with autoreactive
T cell tolerization, including 1) checkpoint molecules, 2) IL-10, and 3) purinergic signaling. Because AIHA is the
most frequently reported hematological adverse event due to cancer immunotherapy, we developed a novel
secondary AIHA model with checkpoint inhibitors. Loss of tolerance in the primary and secondary AIHA mouse
models is associated with an imbalance between regulatory T cells (Tregs) and proinflammatory TH17 T cells,
as well as a distinct population of CD39+ T cells. Herein, we leverage our preclinical AIHA mouse models to
determine which signaling molecules and/or pathways (i.e., checkpoint molecules, IL-10, or purinergic signaling
molecules) are required for T cell tolerance and AIHA prevention, and elucidate how biological factors, such as sex
and age, affect these requirements. The function of unique T cell populations (i.e., recent thymic emigrants, Treg
subsets, and CD39+ T cells) will also be defined. Understanding how the immune system responds to RBC
antigens will provide insight into not only autoimmunity to RBCs but may also have applicability to other
autoantigens present at high concentrations (e.g., platelet autoantigens, dsDNA) thereby making this a powerful
platform to study the requirements for tolerance to self-antigens in general."

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the predominant inherited retinal degenerative disease with a prevalence of 1 in
4,000 worldwide. RP combined with hearing loss is characterized as Usher syndrome (USH), which is the
leading cause of inherited deaf-blindness. Currently, no cure is available for either RP or USH. USH2 is the
most common USH clinical type. USH2A (usherin), ADGRV1 (adhesion G protein-coupled receptor V1), and
WHRN (whirlin) have been identified as three USH2 causative genes. Among them, USH2A is the major
causative gene for USH and autosomal recessive RP (arRP), and ADGRV1 is the second most frequent USH2
causative gene. In photoreceptors, usherin and ADGRV1 proteins interact with whirlin and form a multiprotein
complex at the periciliary membrane between the inner and outer segment, but the functions of individual
USH2 proteins as well as the entire USH2 complex have not been fully elucidated. This knowledge gap hinders
the development of disease mechanism-based treatments. Since many patients carry USH2A mutations, the
development and evaluation of therapeutics that target USH2A is an active area of investigation. However, the
progress of these studies has been slowed down, because of the unknown early retinal molecular defects and
late onset retinal degeneration in USH2 animal and/or in vitro retinal models. In our preliminary studies, we
performed TMT-labeling quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic studies in USH2 mutant mouse retinas
at postnatal day 30 long before retinal degeneration. We discovered alterations in photoreceptor outer segment
membrane proteins, lipidated protein chaperones, BBSome and its cargos, extracellular matrix constituents,
and protein kinase A signaling pathway. Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry experiments
identified USH2 protein-interacting candidates that are enriched with proteins biologically associated with the
early affected molecular and cellular processes in USH2 mutant retinas. We also found protein mislocalization
and light response reduction in young USH2 mutant cones. Building on our extensive preliminary work, we
propose to address the following specific aims in this application: 1) identify and investigate usherin- and
ADGRV1-interacting proteins in the retina; 2) determine primary molecular defects in the retina of three
different Ush2a and Adgrv1 mutant mice; and 3) uncover the molecular cause of early onset cone dysfunction
in USH2 mutant retinas. If successful, our study will reveal the role of the USH2 complex in photoreceptors and
provide insight into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying retinal degeneration caused by USH2 gene
mutations. This study will also inform the development of mechanism-based new therapeutics for USH and
arRP and discover valuable biomarkers that can be applied to therapeutic evaluation."
10897337,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), the wet type of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a major
cause of blindness in the elderly. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has a number
of serious limitations including: 1) many patients respond poorly or not at all to mono anti-VEGF treatments
(non-responders); 2) the long-term outcomes are suboptimal even for responders and can lead to anti-VEGF
resistance; 3) repetitive intravitreal injections adversely affect quality of life and increase the risk of local
complications. Therefore, alternative or combination therapies to improve CNV treatment efficacy represent a
major unmet clinical need. Anti-VEGF resistance in CNV patients is frequently associated with arteriolar CNV
(large-caliber branching arterioles, vascular loops and anastomotic connections), in which macrophages are
known to play important roles, whereas anti-VEGF responders are characterized by capillary CNV, in which
VEGFR2 signaling has an overriding role. The secretory apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) binding protein (AIBP)
binds to its partner apoA-I or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to enhance cholesterol efflux and inhibit lipid raft-
anchored VEGFR2 signaling in hyperactive endothelial cells. By binding the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), AIBP
augments cholesterol efflux from macrophages, thereby suppressing inflammation (Fig. 1). VEGF is an
inflammatory cytokine that recruits macrophages to vascular sites of inflammation where heightened secretion
of additional VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors by macrophages creates positive feedback loops. We
hypothesize that combinations of AIBP, apoA-I and anti-VEGF will combat anti-VEGF resistance by
simultaneously targeting VEGF, endothelial cells, and macrophages. We recently showed that this combination
therapy was effective in treating anti-VEGF resistance by potently inhibiting arteriolar CNV, whereas aflibercept
monotherapy was ineffective (IOVS, 2022). Our objective is to develop AIBP/apoA-I/anti-VEGF combination
gene therapy with broad application and long-term efficacy for AMD, thereby obviating the limitations of current
Aim1 will determine the role of AIBP in pathological angiogenesis. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that targeting
macrophages with AIBP is necessary to overcome anti-VEGF resistance in CNV by combination therapy. Aim
3 will develop long-term AIBP/apoA-I/anti-VEGF combination gene therapy for CNV in mouse AMD models."
10861084,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In spite of increased public awareness, voluntary sleep curtailment remains prevalent and pervasive in our
society. Currently, more than one-third of the US adult population report sleeping 6h or less most nights. This is
problematic as short sleep duration contributes to high cardiovascular (CV) risk and consequent increased CV
disease and mortality. Increasing sleep duration mitigates the metabolic impairment, but alternate strategies to
reduce cardiometabolic risk in habitual short sleepers are lacking. This is especially important when increasing
sleep duration is unsuccessful. Unfortunately, the mechanisms underlying metabolic detriments in short sleepers
are not completely understood. This hinders the development of alternate strategies for CV prevention. In recent
years, the importance of circadian system in maintaining a healthy metabolism is recognized. The circadian
system coordinates 24h periodicity in essential physiological and behavioural function and thus represents a
fundamental component of homeostasis. Conversely, flattening and/or misalignment of the endogenous
circadian rhythms (melatonin secretion) with fasting/feeding behaviour can cause metabolic dysfunction such as
high blood pressure (BP) and insulin resistance (IR). In short sleepers, nighttime exposure to artificial light and
extended eating duration may decrease and delay melatonin secretion. However, no study has examined the
circadian and metabolic effects of eating duration in this population. We hypothesize that extended eating
duration contributes to high BP and IR in habitual short sleepers via altered melatonin secretion.
Therefore, time restricted eating (TRE) will lower BP and IR by increasing and aligning melatonin
secretion to fasting/feeding. Indeed, several TRE clinical trials have shown CV risk reduction in participants
with obesity, pre-diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Interestingly, a recent study suggested that metabolic
consequences of circadian misalignment likely results from misalignment of fasting/feeding with endogenous
circadian rhythm. Support for our hypothesis comes from these prior studies and preliminary data showing that
TRE reduces BP and IR in short sleepers. We will test our hypothesis by conducting an randomized, parallel
arm study in participants with confirmed habitual short sleep (≤6.5h/night) and eating window of >14h/day in out-
patient settings. Participants (n=100, age 18-45y; BMI 25-35kg/m2) will undergo a 4-week intervention during
which they will be randomly assigned to habitual eating duration (>14h/day, control) or shortened eating duration
(TRE, 8h/day). Ambulatory 24h hour BP (Aim 1), glucose metabolism (mixed-meal tolerance test, Aim 2), and
melatonin diurnal rhythm (Aim 3) will be assessed at baseline, mid- and end- intervention to gain temporal
insights. To ensure compliance with assigned eating duration and study protocol, we will continuously monitor
glucose, physical activity, sleep duration, and light exposure. Our study provides mechanistic insights into
circadian dysregulation in short sleepers and corresponding beneficial effects of TRE. The clinical translational
impact of the study is in the identification of TRE as an alternate strategy to offset CV risk in short sleepers."
10893595,"Circadian control of brain-peripheral immune response after stroke
Aging and circadian rhythm are strong modulators of the immune system, and the immune
response is a major contributor to stroke pathophysiology. But how aging and circadian rhythm
interacts to influence immune response after stroke remains poorly understood. In this project,
we will focus on the brain-to-cervical lymph node signaling pathway (Esposito et al, Nat Commun
2019). Because lymphatic drainage is regulated by circadian rhythm, and circadian rhythm is
altered in aging, we hypothesize that this pathway may provide a novel integrating mechanism
that connects these 3 major factors in stroke pathophysiology: immune response, circadian
phase, and aging.
Pilot data (some published in Esposito et al, Nat Commun 2019 and Nature 2020) suggest that
(i) circadian phase significantly influences the progression of injury after cerebral ischemia; (ii)
Bmal1 expression in brain and HO1 in astrocytes are higher after active phase vs inactive phase
strokes; (iii) higher brain HO1 draining into CLN in active phase stroke may decrease oxidative
stress 4-Hydroxynonenal (4HNE) in CLN lymphatic endothelium; (iv) higher brain HO1 draining
into CLN in active phase stroke may reduce cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (TLR4+) in spleen; (v) CD8+
T cell infiltration and brain endothelial Cxcl10 and Hmgb1 may be lower in active phase stroke;
(vi) CSF drainage from brain to CLN is affected by both circadian phase and aging; (vii) aging
alters HO1 brain-to-CLN drainage in active phase stroke.
We will test this overall hypothesis: Astrocytic HO1 in active phase stroke (ZT13) amplifies
endogenous anti-oxidative stress response in CLN, reduces splenic inflammation, and decreases
brain endothelial inflammation, whereas aging alters circadian genes and HO1 drainage in the
CNS, thus weakening this endogenous protective response in active phase stroke.
In Aim 1, we will dissect circadian effects in brain-cervical lymph node signaling after focal cerebral
ischemia. In Aim 2, we will investigate the effects of circadian rhythm in post-stroke brain
endothelial inflammation. In Aim 3, we will investigate effects of aging in circadian rhythm-
mediated systemic response after focal cerebral ischemia. This project should define new
mechanisms that connect the stroke immune response with circadian biology and aging, thus
provide a new conceptual framework for seeking targets and biomarkers for day-time vs night-
time strokes in aging patients."
10726592,"Abstract
Approximately half of the roughly 40 million people with HIV (PHIV) worldwide develop HIV
associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), regardless of whether they receive combined
antiretroviral therapy (cART). Mild forms of HAND, which are most common in PHIV on cART,
ultimately progress to dementia. Treatment strategies to eradicate HIV are ongoing, but in
reality the brain will remain an HIV reservoir for the foreseeable future. Therefore, developing
adjunctive treatments for HAND is important while simultaneously advancing eradication
strategies. Another important point is targeting treatments to mild forms of HAND [prior to
dementia], when treatment is more likely to stabilize or reverse HAND. To best accomplish this,
an animal model must be used that is practical, displays cognitive deficits and pathology
consistent with mild HAND in humans, and preferably employs replicating HIV so that long-term
effects of treatments and eradication strategies can be optimally investigated. However,
currently there is no model that incorporates all of these important features. Recently it has
been shown that humanized (BLT) mouse models of HIV infection exhibit trafficking of human
cells to mouse brain, including T cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MP), which are the cell
types infected by HIV. HIV-infected human MP and T cells have been demonstrated in BLT
brains, HIV DNA and RNA can be quantitated in brain, and there is a mouse MP reaction similar
that seen in humans with mild HAND. Importantly the BLT model exhibits long lived brain
infection, which enables testing of novel treatments in sufficient numbers of animals to
determine statistically significant, prolonged effects and tolerability in BLT mice that can also be
simultaneously treated with cART. However, BLT mice have not been shown to have cognitive
deficits or neuronal abnormalities, which are hallmarks of HAND. The proposed studies will test
BLT mice for cognitive deficits using techniques that are established in our current short term
SCID mouse HAND model. Essential pathological parameters to be monitored will be brain HIV
load, mouse and human brain MP inflammatory activity, and neuronal dendritic integrity in
important regions such as frontal cortex, hippocampus and the basal ganglia. These are also
established techniques in our current short-term HAND model. Therefore, the first aim is to
validate the BLT model according to important features of HAND including cognitive deficits and
associated neuronal pathology. The second major aim of the proposal is to validate novel
treatments previously shown to be effective in the short-term HAND model with long-term
testing for efficacy in HAND, safety and potentially brain HIV eradication. It is predicted that this
model will be validated along with novel treatments as detailed in the proposal, providing a
direct conduit to human clinical trials."
10726593,"Treatments for virus-induced diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are sub-optimal or
nonexistent. West Nile virus (WNV) is the most common cause of epidemic encephalitis within the US. This
proposal will investigate the role of microglia during WNV infections of the CNS and will evaluate microglial
stimulation as a potential treatment strategy for WNV-induced CNS disease.
 Virus infection of the CNS results in a robust host neuroinflammatory response, including the
activation of CNS immune cells (microglia). The role of microglia in virus-induced CNS disease remains
unclear. They likely play a protective role in facilitating the removal of infected cells and the recovery of
damaged neurons. However, many of the factors released by microglia may contribute to injury within the
CNS. Indeed, neuroinflammation in general and microglia activation in particular are key pathogenic
components following neurologic injury and during noninfectious forms of neurologic and neurodegenerative
disease. Our in vivo and ex vivo models will allow us to compare the role of microglia in the brain and spinal
cord. Since microglia are central to a variety of CNS injury and disease pathologies, including
neurodegenerative diseases, the proposed experiments will likely have wide reaching clinical implications.
 We have recently shown that depletion of microglia, with the colony stimulating factor receptor 1
(CSFR1) antagonist PLX5622, results in increased severity of WNV-induced CNS disease in mice that is
associated with an increase in CNS viral titers. In Specific Aim 1 of this proposal we will use PLX5622 targeted
depletion of microglia to determine whether microglia impact viral growth at the point of viral entry into the
CNS, viral replication within the CNS, or viral clearance. Microglia function to identify and remove invading
pathogens by phagocytosing infected or damaged cells, by acting as antigen presenting cells required to
generate a complete antigen specific T cell response, and by secreting immune modulatory molecules. In
Specific Aim 2 we will determine which of these mechanisms are required for microglia to inhibit WNV growth
in the CNS.
 In Specific Aim 3 we will determine the efficacy of microglial stimulation as a treatment strategy for
WNV-induced CNS disease. For these studies we will use granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF), a haematopoietic growth factor and proinflammatory cytokine, that induces, proliferates, and
activates microglia. Recombinant human GM-CSF is already FDA-approved to treat conditions in which white
blood cell counts are low, such as in certain types of leukemia or bone marrow transplant recipients. GM-CSF
and is currently being investigated as a potential treatment for cognitive problems related to Alzheimer's
disease. Mice will be treated with recombinant human GM-CSF (Leukine) and will be monitored to determine
viral CNS titers, virus-induced tissue injury and death, and the persistence of neurological sequelae in
surviving mice."

10913590,"ABSTRACT
 Chronic wounds are a growing public health threat, with over 6.5 million people affected in the US alone,
costing upwards of $30 billion annually. The single-most-important cause of delayed wound healing is bacterial
infection, often in the form of biofilms that impede antibiotic penetration and force the bacteria into a “dormant”
state where they are more tolerant to antibiotics. Antibiotics work so poorly against biofilm-infected wounds due
to 1) poor drug penetration and 2) the presence of drug-tolerant persister cells within biofilms. These factors
contribute to a 70% infection recurrence rate. Failure to completely eradicate biofilms during antibiotic
therapy can result in significant quality-of-life reduction, hospitalization, sepsis, amputation and death.
 Comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease further complicate therapeutic strategies. Every
day in the US, 230 patients suffer an amputation due to a chronic wound infection, the majority due to diabetic
foot infections. There is an urgent need for improved wound care therapies but with the void in the drug-
development platform, innovation is mostly centered around wound closure rather than improving antibiotic
efficacy. Recently, the technology of acoustically active cavitation agents, microbubbles and phase-change
contrast agents (PCCA), for ultrasound-mediated drug delivery has made several substantial advances and is
currently in clinical trials for other applications. In this proposal, we will develop a non-invasive theranostic
ultrasound platform to improve delivery of anti-persister drugs into biofilm-infected wounds. Our
encouraging preliminary data in an in vivo diabetic mouse model observed improved traditional therapeutic
clearance of MRSA biofilms by 94% in chronic wounds using a topical-only approach. Importantly, we achieved
complete eradication (below limit of detection) in 3 out of 8 animals.
 In this project, we propose to optimize the efficacy of our acoustically responsive biocompatible particles and
therapeutic ultrasound parameters to potentiate various antibiotics against biofilms of the most common
pathogens in chronic wound infections (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus
faecalis) in vitro, in conjunction with investigating mechanisms of action by quantifying therapeutic penetration
and cavitation activity in vitro (specific aim 1). We will then evaluate this approach in a polymicrobial diabetic
chronic wound infection model (specific aim 2). For this, we will focus on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Staphylococcus aureus, the two organisms that most commonly co-infect chronic wounds. Measures of wound
healing, wound closure and reduction in bacterial burden will be quantified and benchmarked against current
standard of care systemic antibiotic administration, where cavitation activity will also be evaluated for its ability
to predict early response to therapy. Our proposed approach has the potential to have a substantial impact on
the treatment of polymicrobial biofilms in chronic wounds."
10932925,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Advances in childhood cancer therapies have resulted in >80% five-year survival rates.1 With nearly 500,000
childhood cancer survivors in the U.S., there is a growing need to address and mitigate late effects of
treatment.2,3 Fertility impairment occurs in about half of male childhood cancer survivors and can negatively
impact quality of life.4,5 Sperm banking is an established and widely available form of fertility preservation.6
Despite recognizing the value of future parenthood and guidelines to bank sperm before treatment,6,7 banking
remains underutilized among male adolescents with cancer, especially at hospitals with low resources.8-10
Studies show adolescent males are more likely to bank sperm prior to cancer treatment if: 1) their institution
has dedicated fertility services,11 2) their provider recommends banking,12 and 3) their parents recommend it.13
To improve equitable care and access to sperm banking opportunities,10 family-centered decision tools, and
strategies to implement these tools, are critical. Our team developed the Family-centered Adolescent Sperm
banking Tool (FAST) and tested it prospectively among families of adolescent males newly diagnosed with
cancer. We found the FAST prompted deeper thinking and facilitated family communication about parenthood
goals and banking,17 and that sperm banking rates increased significantly.19 Given feasibility and equity
considerations (i.e., short time frame, variety of settings in which fertility counseling is delivered), the objective
of this proposal is to adapt the FAST to a web-based tool that can be accessed in inpatient/outpatient/non-
clinical settings, identify implementation strategies for high and low-resourced settings, and test these in a
three-site pilot study among 110 families of adolescent males (13-21 years of age) newly diagnosed with
cancer. Specific aims are to: 1) adapt the FAST (design and delivery) based on patient and caregiver
stakeholder feedback (usability testing), which will result in a web-based tool that is functional, acceptable to
families, and feasible to implement pre-cancer treatment; 2) conduct rapid contextual inquiry using a mixed-
methods approach with clinician stakeholders, to identify tailored implementation strategies for the web-based
FAST in both high and low-resourced pediatric cancer centers, prepare for adoption into clinical pathways, and
ensure fidelity and sustainability, and 3) pilot the web-based FAST and tailored implementation strategies
locally and at 2 additional sites (1 high and 1 low-resourced) to examine feasibility, acceptability, and impact on
banking rates (pre-/post design) to prepare for a larger multi-site hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial.
Findings will result in an innovative decision tool that can be easily accessed on the web and implemented at a
wide variety of high and low-resourced settings to facilitate banking decisions among adolescent males with
cancer. These efforts will optimize long-term outcomes by expanding opportunities for parenthood and
contributing to improved quality of life in a growing population of survivors, including underserved populations."
10917355,"Our overarching goal is to advance understanding of mitochondrial mechanisms of carbon
monoxide (CO) poisoning to develop diagnostics, therapeutics, and clinical trials. CO poisoning
remains a major cause of death and disability, affecting 50,000 people per year in the United States
alone. Patients removed from fires or following exposure to car and home generator exhaust are
placed on 100% oxygen and transferred to a facility with a hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) delivery system.
Despite the availability of HBO therapy centers in most major cities, inherent delays in access to and
initiation of therapy greatly limit efficacy. In fact, even with HBO oxygen therapy a substantial number
of surviving patients exhibit permanent neurocognitive impairments. This highlights an urgent need for
alternative therapy. In the present proposal, we propose to study novel antidotal therapies for CO
poisoning, based on our in vivo preliminary data that the use of a succinate prodrug relieves partial
CIV inhibition caused by CO poisoning. Another existing gap is the lack of effective biomarkers to
gauge severity, prognosis, and response to treatment. While a carboxyhemoglobin level is readily
available at most institutions, its use is limited only to confirm exposure with no predictive value. The
three main objectives our proposal seeks to address are: (1) extent of mitochondrial involvement for
diagnostics and therapies; (2) limitations of current biomarkers to gauge severity of disease and
treatment response; (3) lack of treatment strategies that target mitochondrial dysfunction to mitigate
long-term neurologic and cardiac disability. Specifically for this A1 submission, we recently developed
a novel survival swine model for CO poisoning with clinically relevant outcome metrics that include
behavioral, imaging, and biomolecular measures. We also have obtained additional noninvasive
optical data that also correlate with tissue respiration data. Another important feature of this proposal
is the evaluation of a new treatment strategy involving a mitochondrial prodrug with the potential to
shift existing treatment paradigm. We will also leverage our biomedical optics technology measuring
cerebral blood flow, oxygenation, COHb and redox states of CIV in real time which will allow us to
further elucidate the mechanisms of CO combined with repeat measures using two clinically relevant
exposure duration with varying doses as well as prolonged low dose CO exposure.
Aim 1 • To investigate the mitochondrial mechanisms that contribute to the neurologic and cardiac
injury with the use of blood cell as a liquid biomarker in both acute AND early chronic CO poisoning.
Aim 2 • Randomized, blinded pre-clinical intervention trial in swine models of CO poisoning to
compare an engineered succinate prodrug to standard therapy of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO)."
10852949,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Annually, liver disease accounts for nearly 2 million deaths worldwide. Immune responses in the liver must
balance elimination of local infection with non-reactivity to benign gut-derived dietary and microbial antigens.
Excessive/dysregulated immune activation in the absence of infection promotes liver tissue damage while
insufficient immunity facilitates the development of chronic infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, there
is an urgent need to pinpoint immunological pathways that can be modified to control hepatic maladies without
compromising liver function. Our proposal will utilize malaria liver stage infection as a model system to identify
factors that dictate the quality of hepatic CD8 T cell responses. Plasmodium malaria parasites initially infect the
liver and replicate as liver stages within hepatocytes to generate exoerythrocytic merozoites that are released to
infect red blood cells. Liver stages are essential to establish infection but are clinically silent and were only
recently shown to induce a significant innate immune response. We previously demonstrated that Plasmodium
infection induced IFN-I signaling weakens anti-Plasmodium adaptive immunity by promoting the development of
dysfunctional hepatic CD8 T cells. This dysfunctional signature bears striking similarity to the T cell exhaustion
program induced by chronic infection and tumors. Yet, how does a transient, non-chronic infection that is limited
to hepatocytes induce such profound T cell dysfunction? We now report that IFN-I signaling solely in hepatocytes
is a major contributor to the induction of hepatic CD8 T cell dysfunction suggesting that hepatocytes are central
immune platforms that determine the quality of adaptive immunity in the liver. From functional assays and gene
expression analyses of hepatocytes enriched from mice infected with rodent malaria parasites or human-liver
chimeric mice infected with Plasmodium falciparum, we show that this IFN-I response is initiated by hepatocyte
expression of the IRF3 transcription factor. Moreover, we establish that concurrent with IFN-I induction, LS
infection profoundly reshapes the hepatocyte transcriptome and metabolome likely inducing an
immunosuppressive microenvironment around the infected hepatocyte, which we predict impairs an ensuing
hepatic T cell response. In Aim 1, we will use cutting-edge single cell multi-omic studies and functional analyses
to identify hallmark features of Plasmodium infection induced CD8 T cell dysfunction to determine whether it is
distinct from bonafide T cell exhaustion. In Aim 2, we will focus on hepatocytes to characterize how parasite-
induced IFN-I signaling remodels intrahepatocyte transcriptomes and metabolomes to impair hepatic CD8 T cell
responses. In Aim 3, we will generate novel transgenic parasites that deliver viral antagonists of IRF3 into the
infected hepatocyte to compromise Plasmodium-induced IFN-I signaling solely within the infected hepatocyte
and improve anti-Plasmodium adaptive immunity. These aims will broaden and deepen our understanding of the
immune responses to a complex eukaryotic pathogen to improve liver-directed anti-malaria vaccines."

Alkylation DNA damage caused by alkylating agents promotes mutations and cancer development. Guanine N7
is targeted by a wide range of alkylating mutagens, carcinogens, and anticancer agents, producing the cationic
N7-alkylguanine (N7-alkylG) adducts as major lesions. These lesions have half-lives of several hours to days in
DNA and thus can affect DNA replication and transcription. The positively charged N7-alkylG lesions can also
undergo further modification to generate secondary lesions such as alkyl-formamidopyrimidine (alkyl-FapyG)
adducts. The recognition, repair, and mutagenesis mechanisms of many mutagen/carcinogen-induced N7-
alkylG and alkyl-FapyG lesions, except for a few lesions such as N7-aflatoxin B1-G and aflatoxin B1-FapyG
adducts, remain poorly characterized, thereby precluding a complete understanding of the contribution of these
major lesions to mutations and cancer development. For example, the mutagenic properties of the predominant
N7-alkylG adducts produced by the cancer-promoting styrene oxide are unknown. This knowledge gap has
been due in part to the technical difficulty in preparing a site-specific N7-alkylG- and alkyl-FapyG-containing
DNA, which is ascribed to the rapid depurination of N7-alkylG nucleosides and the facile isomerization of alkyl-
FapyG during solid-phase DNA synthesis. To overcome the stability issue of N7-alkylG nucleosides, we have
developed a 2’-fluorine technology that prevents spontaneous depurination by increasing the stability of N7-
alkylG nucleosides. To solve the isomerization problem of alkyl-FapyG, we have taken a post-synthetic
approach that produces alkyl-FapyG-containing DNA from N7-alkylG-containing DNA. Our preliminary studies
show that guanine N7 alkylation can influence base-pairing properties by facilitating the formation of the rare
enol tautomer, syn base conformation, and/or intercalation. Our central hypothesis is that N7-alkylG and alkyl-
FapyG adducts promote mutations and cancer development by altering the base-pairing properties of the
damaged guanine. Our long-term research goal is to elucidate the biological impacts of chemically labile
alkylation damages and their secondary lesions using innovative approaches such as the 2’-F chemistry, the
polβ host-guest-complex system, and post-synthetic DNA modification. The objective is to dissect the biological
consequences of N7-alkylG and alkyl-FapyG lesions induced by potent alkylating mutagens and anticancer
agents such as nicotine-specific nitrosamine, styrene oxide, nitrogen mustards, and N-methylbenzyl nitrosamine.
To accomplish this objective, we will characterize the base-pairing properties and the recognition, mutagenesis,
and repair mechanisms of N7-alkylG and alkyl-FapyG adducts using combined tools of synthetic, biochemical,
structural biology, and cellular approaches. The successful execution of the proposed programs will greatly
advance our knowledge of the impact of carcinogen/drug-induced N7-alkylG and alkyl-FapyG lesions on the
base pair conformation, stability, tautomerism, mutagenesis, recognition, and repair, thereby providing important
insights into the alkylation damage-induced mutations and cancer development."
10906173,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Emerging evidence suggests that infants with greater appetitive drive may benefit from different feeding
approaches for the prevention of obesity and chronic disease. Slower milk delivery may be a promising
strategy, given that slower eating is associated with reduced intake and lesser weight gain throughout the
lifespan, including in infancy. In a sample of 243 infants aged 2-4 months, slower milk delivery increased
sucking effort and reduced intake. The results of this experiment, though reflective of only a single pair of
feedings, suggest that slower milk delivery may be a promising intervention strategy for addressing excessive
infant weight gain. However, many questions remain before the development of such an intervention could be
pursued, including the mechanism for this behavior change. The proposed project will examine infant, mother,
and dyadic interaction behavior during the feedings with slower milk delivery from this experiment, and
compare infant, mother, and dyadic behavior between faster and slower milk delivery to address the following
aims. Aim 1 (K99): To examine the relative contributions of infant (satiation signaling, behavioral distress,
sucking vigor), maternal (responsivity, behavioral distress), and dyadic (mutuality, feeding duration) behaviors
as mechanisms explaining the effect of slowed milk delivery on reduced intake in a single feeding. Aim 2
(K99): To examine whether the pathways of association in this conceptual model differ between infants with
typical versus high appetitive drive. Aim 3 (R00): Among 220 infants at age 8-12 weeks, to examine—across
72 hours of feedings in which milk delivery rate is slowed by 30% compared to typical—the cross-lagged
associations of changes from baseline in sucking vigor and feeding frequency with infant satiation signaling,
infant behavioral distress, and dyadic mutuality and to determine if these associations differ based on higher
versus lower infant appetitive drive. The PI, Dr. Crandall, is a behavioral scientist with an interdisciplinary
background in nutrition, psychology, and public health. Her growing research program seeks to understand
the cascading effect of high infant appetitive drive, integrating the dyadic nature of infant eating/feeding with
the hope of developing safe, effective, and equitable intervention strategies. With the support of a
multidisciplinary team of mentors, during the training phase of this award Dr. Crandall will grow her content
knowledge of the physiology of infant eating behavior and growth; gain experience with three levels of
behavioral coding of mother-infant feeding interactions; gain experience with structural equation modeling
techniques; and, in the R00 phase, conduct an independent investigation of infant/mother feeding behavior
with slower milk delivery across multiple days. At the conclusion of the award period, Dr. Crandall will be
poised to test an intervention designed to manage high appetitive drive and excessive intake, among infants
most at risk, while promoting maternal and infant well-being and the health of the dyadic interaction."
10877791,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The prevailing dogma in the alcohol field is that the rewarding properties of ethanol (EtOH) result from
enhancement of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neural activity and accompanying DA release in
the mesolimbic reward system. In preliminary studies, we will demonstrate that some of EtOH’s effects on
midbrain neurons and NAc DA release are mediated by peripheral substrates including DA D2-subtype 2
receptor (D2R) expressing monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). These findings suggest a neuroimmune
interaction for acute EtOH use and challenge the dogma that EtOH has exclusively central effects on DA
neuronal activity, release, and reward. Our proposed studies constitute a focused investigation into the role of
neuroimmune interactions in EtOH effects on VTA neurons, DA transmission, and EtOH reward and consumption.
The core thesis is that acute EtOH enhancement of mesolimbic DA transmission and EtOH reward is
mediated by EtOH enhancement of blood DA, subsequent activation of D2R-expressing MDMs, and
subsequent cytokine modulation of VTA neurons, that are responsible for chronic adaptations in VTA
GABA neurons and DA release. Prior and preliminary evidence supporting our hypothesis include: 1)
Peripheral DA increases the activity of DA neurons and NAc DA release, reduces locomotor activity, and
promotes reward via peripheral D2Rs; 2) EtOH enhances blood DA, inhibits VTA GABA neurons, enhances
brain DA, and reduces intoxication via peripheral D2Rs; 3) EtOH induces microglia activation and enhances D2
receptor expression on monocytes, neurons, and microglia; 4) Depletion of MDMs reduces EtOH effects on VTA
GABA neurons and DA release; 5) Select cytokines enhance VTA neuron excitability and DA release; 6) Last,
we show preliminary evidence of DA and ATP co-release from DA terminals, and motility effects of EtOH on
microglia, which indicate further study for potential NAc EtOH immune interactions in vivo.
 These data will provide new, fundamental knowledge on the neurobiology of EtOH reward and
dependence and the role of peripheral substrates that may help improve drug development efforts. To test the
hypotheses, we propose two Specific Aims: 1) Define the role of peripheral neuroimmune interactions in EtOH
effects on VTA GABA neurons and NAc DA release, and related behaviors; 2) Describe effects of EtOH on NAc
DA terminals and microglia, co-release of DA and ATP. We will use wild-type and transgenic mouse models
(GAD67-GFP knock-in; VGAT-Chr2, VGAT-Cre/GAD67-GFP; and MaFIA mice) and MDM depletion to study
neurochemical and electrochemical recordings of DA release. Cytometry techniques will be used to determine
cytokine factors involved in mesolimbic alterations. Multiphoton microscopy approaches to study microglia
chemotaxis in the context of DA and ATP as measured by fast scan cyclic voltammetry. Multiphoton microscopy
will be used in vivo through endoscopic relay gradient index lenses to study GFP labeled satellite microglia
surveillance while measured dopamine release using a red shifted optical sensor for detecting DA release, which
will be performed on mice undergoing chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) induction, thus describing neuroimmune
activity from first exposure to EtOH, through to dependence. Scientific rigor is high considering the use of
conventional behavioral, pharmacological, electrochemical, microscopy and molecular tools."

Pediatric OCD is a public health problem and many remain symptomatic even after receiving efficacious
treatments. The success of exposure and response prevention (ERP), a first-line behavioral treatment,
depends on the ability to refrain from compulsions during exposure tasks. Improving this “therapy critical
behavior” is a potentially important strategy for ERP augmentation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
(rTMS) can be leveraged to stimulate healthier functioning of brain circuits underlying therapy critical
behaviors. The overall objective of this R61/R33 is to test whether augmenting ERP with rTMS over cortical
nodes of select cortico-striatal circuits implicated in compulsivity can normalize connectivity and enhance
response prevention in youth and young adults with OCD.
The R61 phase of this project will use a masked RCT design to test whether ERP+TMS engages 1)
hypothesized circuits involved in compulsivity and 2) observed response prevention during ERP exposure
tasks. Youth ages 12-21 years with OCD will complete a full course of ERP plus randomly assigned TMS
regimens of sham, iTBS to dlPFC, or cTBS to pSMA (n=20 per group). Milestones for the R61 phase are
determination that at least one active rTMS condition a) changes RSFC in the hypothesized circuit within- and
between-subjects and b) is safe and feasible.
The R33 phase will use a masked RCT design to establish whether ERP+TMS engagement of the circuit and
behavioral targets mediates changes in OCD symptom severity. A new sample of youth ages 12-21 with OCD
will receive ERP plus either sham or active TMS stimulation, using the optimal TMS regimen identified in the
R61 (n=30 per group). Exploratory analyses in both phases will examine whether neurocognitive task
performance predicts symptom change, changes differentially by treatment arm, and corresponds with fMRI-
measured metrics of cortico-striatal circuitry.
At the end of this award, we will have determined whether rTMS is effective for improving compulsive behavior
and functional connectivity in circuits underlying compulsivity, and whether these mediate change in clinical
outcomes. If successful, we will be poised to conduct a large-scale trial of rTMS with ERP for pediatric OCD,
including a confirmatory test of the linked mechanisms of both treatments. Ultimately, results from this line of
research will inform understanding of neural mechanisms in rTMS and OCD and will provide a model for
studying linked mechanisms in augmentation trials."

Platelets play a pivotal role in hemostasis and thrombosis as they are required for platelet aggregation which
contributes to both the arrest of bleeding and the development of arterial thrombi. The platelet receptor integrin
αIIbβ3 plays a non-redundant role in supporting platelet-platelet interactions via binding of fibrinogen
(aggregation) while its interaction with polymerized fibrin stabilizes the clot by the process of clot retraction. A
fundamental challenge in thrombosis research is to understand precisely how platelets interact with fibrinogen
versus polymerized fibrin and, how the latter dynamically retracts the clot. The aim of this proposal is to apply
state-of-the-art and novel experimental approaches to obtain new insights and understanding of fibrin-αIIbβ3
binding and signaling mechanisms leading to clot retraction and thrombus stabilization. To that end, I developed
a novel assay for assessing the interaction of platelets with fibrin, independent of platelet-fibrinogen interactions,
and I recently developed a high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of clot retraction. I screened
408,724 compounds, from which I identified 580 confirmed inhibitory compounds. With colleagues, I have also
screened 301 murine monoclonal antibodies (mAb’s) made in response to immunization with human platelets or
αIIbβ3 and have identified 4 antibodies that inhibit clot retraction but not platelet adhesion to fibrinogen. Using
structural, biochemical, and functional approaches, I now propose to: i) determine the mechanisms of action of
the different inhibitors of clot retraction, with the goal of identifying novel fibrin-specific targets for antiplatelet
therapy. ii) employ cryo-electron microscopy to obtain structural information on the binding sites on αIIbβ3 of the
fibrin-specific mAb’s and thus their mechanisms of interfering with clot-retraction. iii) study the unique αIIbβ3-
fibrin cellular interactions and signaling pathways with methods to capture and analyze the protein complexes
that form in response to fibrin-αIIbβ3 interaction. My mentor, Dr. Barry Coller is an expert in platelet and αIIbβ3
translational research, having developed the first FDA approved αIIbβ3 antagonist and with a second in a Phase
3 study. My co-mentor, Dr. Alisa Wolberg is a leader in platelet-fibrin interactions and clot retraction. During this
award I will continue my technical and scientific education by training in several outstanding collaborating
laboratories in techniques that will serve as building blocks for an RO1 research proposal I plan to submit in year
3 of this award, leading to scientific independence at the end of this award. Rockefeller University provides an
outstanding research environment, with a wide range of lectures, seminars, and symposia, and access to state-
of-the-art equipment and resource centers, led by senior scientists who are charged with training junior scientists.
Dr. Coller and Rockefeller University are committed to a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive scientific
community and so are delighted to support Dr. Buitrago’s application, because of her demonstrated commitment
to mentor and serve as a role model for women scientists and scientists from underrepresented minority groups."

10881306,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The exact mechanism underlying the onset of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a disease that affects over 2 million people
worldwide and ~ 400,000 in the United States, is unknown although most experts in the field agree that MS
involves an abnormal immune-mediated response against the body’s central nervous system (CNS).
Specifically, in the CNS, components of the immune system attack myelin, the protein-based substance that
surrounds nerve fiber. This attack on myelin results in multiple scar lesions (hence, Multiple Sclerosis) that lead
to disease symptoms. Mounting evidence suggests that a breakdown in the blood brain barrier (BBB) enables
the permeability of toxins and other foreign pathogens into the CNS that attack the myelin. Here, an investigative
team with basic and clinical science experience proposes that hypermetabolic red blood cells (RBCs) in the MS
circulation are contributing to increased glucose utilization in the brain and subsequent BBB breakdown.
Specifically, during our previous project period, the investigative team discovered and recently published several
interesting findings involving the MS RBC. First, the MS RBC has a significantly increased amount of the GLUT1
glucose transporter in its membrane. The GLUT1 transporter is the dominant glucose transporter in the RBC
(and most circulatory cells) and is not affected by insulin. Secondly, we reported that C-peptide, the 31-amino
acid peptide that is co-secreted in equal molecule amounts with insulin from the pancreatic -cells, binds to the
MS RBC at a level nearly 50% higher than control RBCs and RBCs obtained from people with other neurological
diseases (ONDs, as rigorous controls). Finally, we reported an increase in ATP release from the MS RBC upon
stimulation, indicating increased glycolysis. Collectively, our data and other recent data in the literature from
other groups, suggest MS RBCs are hypermetabolic. The link to the compromised BBB occurs when considering
recent impactful work in the literature that supports decades-old reports of hypermetabolic RBCs in people with
MS. The increased metabolism results in a significant increase in lactic acid (lactate) production in the MS
circulation, which may compromise BBB integrity through localized changes in pH. During the renewal project
period, the investigative team plans to deepen our understanding of MS by further developing novel tools to
study the MS RBC at the single cell level, as well as in humans, with novel in vivo imaging strategies. We will
also better power our previous studies by increasing the number of MS patients at the different stages of MS.
These aims will inform an in vivo PET/MRI clinical study in years 4-5 designed to determine glucose utilization
before and after normal dosing of interferon-beta (IFN-, a common MS disease modifying therapy), thereby
providing impactful information on the mechanism of MS disease onset."

Iron deficiency (ID) is the predominant cause of anemia globally. Children, menstruating and pregnant women,
and the elderly are at highest risk for iron depletion. ID complicates pregnancies, impairs cognitive development
in infants, and decreases work output in adults. Iron overload (IO) occurs most frequently in hereditary
hemochromatosis (HH). Up to ~1:300 individuals of Northern European descent carry the most frequent
mutation; 10% of these individuals are likely to develop pathological liver iron overload. HH causes arthralgia,
osteoporosis, cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and hypogonadism. HH results from mutations ultimately
affecting production of the iron-regulatory hormone, hepcidin. Humans cannot efficiently excrete excess iron, so
body iron content is maintained by modulation of intestinal iron absorption. Dysregulation of intestinal iron
absorption underlies perturbations of iron homeostasis in ID and IO. Dietary iron exists mainly as heme iron (HI)
and nonheme iron (NHI). Absorption of dietary NHI critically involves an iron importer (DMT1) and an iron
exporter (FPN). Mechanisms of HI absorption have remained elusive. Most research in iron biology has focused
on mouse models; however, mice are thought to inefficiently absorb dietary heme. To overcome this hurdle, we
established a new model of HI absorption, the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat. SD rats efficiently utilized dietary HI to
normally support pregnancy, lactation, and postnatal pup development. Moreover, hepcidin (Hamp) KO rats
(modeling HH) developed iron overload when fed a HI diet, thus reflecting elevated HI absorption. In this
investigation, we will leverage unique dietary and genetic SD rat models of ID and IO to test novel hypotheses
related to HI absorption. Our specific goals are to test: 1) Whether NHI and HI absorption is coordinately
regulated. This seems likely given that intestinal iron absorption must be tightly controlled to maintain overall
body iron homeostasis; 2) Whether DMT1 and FPN influence HI absorption. Heme is likely absorbed by
endocytosis, followed by export from endosomes by a heme transporter. Cytosolic heme has two possible fates:
a) Degradation by heme-oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), which liberates iron that then mixes with the dietary NHI pool;
or b) Export out of the enterocyte via a heme exporter, followed by degradation in the liver. We hypothesize that
HI and NHI transporters co-localize on plasma and vesicular membranes, thus facilitating functional interactions;
and 3) Whether HRG1 is an intestinal heme transporter. HRG1 transports heme with high affinity, it is
expressed on the apical surface of human duodenal enterocytes, and it is regulated by iron and heme. HRG1 is
thus a plausible candidate for the long sought intestinal heme iron importer. Studies proposed herein will utilize
the HRG1 KO SD rat. Collectively, the use of new dietary and genetic SD rat models of iron adequacy, ID, and
IO uniquely position us to be able to address unresolved, fundamental questions relating to mechanisms of
intestinal HI absorption, and to elucidate whether pathways of HI and NHI absorption intersect. Clinical and
translational potential is high, as dietary HI and NHI both contribute to systemic iron homeostasis in humans."
10920491,"Project Summary
Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects ~100,000 Americans and millions worldwide, with healthcare costs in the U.S. exceeding $1 billion
annually to treat frequent and unpredictable vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). Despite the same, monogenic disease that results in
the production of hemoglobin S (HbS) causing mature red blood cells (RBCs) to sickle following deoxygenation, the frequency of VOEs
amongst SCD patients is highly variable. Sickle reticulocytes (immature RBCs) contribute to VOEs by participating in a series of
adhesive events mediated by cell surface adhesion molecules that delay blood flow in small blood vessels which promote sickling and
entrapment of RBCs in the microvasculature. Hydroxyurea (HU), the mainstay therapy for SCD, reduces but does not eliminate VOEs,
hence treated patients remain at considerable risk for debilitating VOEs. Initially, HU was administered to induce hemoglobin F (HbF)
expression with anti-sickling effects, although HU also provides immediate clinical benefits by increasing nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP
levels (NO 2nd messenger) and decreasing adhesion receptor expression and RBC-endothelial interactions. There is some compelling
evidence that HU modulates adhesion by upregulating a NO/cGMP-dependent pathway to decrease adhesion receptor activity;
however, specific mechanisms are unclear. A better understanding of HU mechanisms that reduce adhesive interactions will reveal
novel therapeutic targets to reduce VOEs effectively in SCD. My long-term goal is to identify cellular and molecular targets to aid in the
development of effective therapies to improve the care for SCD patients. This project will enhance our knowledge of the pathobiological
mechanisms underpinning SCD and will allow us to gain new insights into molecular pathways that influence the clinical manifestations
and severity of SCD. Novel concepts proposed in the research proposal combined with a detailed training plan and mentorship from a
highly accomplished team of basic science, translational, and clinical researchers will also facilitate my career development.
 Very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), the best characterized adhesion receptor in SCD, is highly expressed on reticulocytes and white
blood cells (WBCs). Like other integrins, VLA-4 is functionally regulated by cell signaling pathways to modulate activity and binding
affinity to a wide variety of ligands elevated in the SCD micro-environment. VLA-4 expressing reticulocytes and WBCs are elevated
during VOEs and in SCD patients with severe disease phenotypes, but decreased in response to HU therapy. Utilizing our
standardized, flow adhesion bioassay, we previously showed that VLA-4 binding can be used clinically to stratify SCD patients
based on disease severity and predict impending VOEs. We have also shown that reticulocyte and HbF levels strongly correlate with
VLA-4 binding and VLA-4-mediated adhesion is increased during patient-reported VOEs and decreased in HU-treated SCD patients.
More recently, preliminary data from my lab demonstrate that HU reduces VLA-4 activity/binding affinity in sickle reticulocytes.
Others have shown that VLA-4 binding is enhanced by a kinase-dependent mechanism and reduced through NO/cGMP pathway
signaling; yet, specific mechanisms in sickle RBCs are unclear. My central hypothesis is that HU reduces RBC-endothelial
interactions in SCD by decreasing kinase activity through a NO/cGMP-dependent pathway. Using our standardized flow adhesion
assay, optimized flow cytometry protocol, and mass spectrometric approach, I will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims:
1) Determine the effect of HU on VLA-4 activity/binding affinity; and 2) Elucidate HU mechanisms that modulate VLA-4 protein-
protein interactions and post-translational modifications in sickle RBCs."
10873894,"The long-term goal of our work is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with Aspergillus infections by
improving outcomes of host-pathogen interactions. Aspergillus fumigatus is the major airborne fungal pathogen
and is responsible for a range of clinical syndromes, the severity of which is dependent on host immune status.
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and disseminated infections can occur in severely immunocompromised hosts
and are often associated with mortality rates of up to 90%. In immune competent hosts, A. fumigatus colonization
can lead to chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), a clinical manifestation with recently defined diagnostic
criteria that impacts upwards of 1.6 million individuals per year. Many individuals with CPA have underlying
respiratory conditions, such as asthma or cystic fibrosis, that are further exacerbated by the presence of the
fungus. Although multiple Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) driving host recognition and
response are known, uncovering novel fungal molecular pathways that could serve as therapeutic targets to
enhance or mask PAMP display and/or biosynthesis could prove useful therapeutic targets to modulate host
response for improved outcomes. To address this, we utilized activation of the inflammasome, a multiprotein
intracellular complex that detects pathogenic organisms to initiate inflammatory responses, as a tool to uncover
Aspergillus mutants with altered abilities to activate host response. We have completed a preliminary screen to
measure IL-1β secretion from a macrophage differentiated human monocyte cell line employing an A. fumigatus
protein kinase disruption library recently generated in our lab. Of 118 protein kinase disruption mutants screened,
we identified seven A. fumigatus protein kinases that either significantly increased (n=2) or decreased (n=5)
inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion upon disruption. Strikingly, both of the protein kinase disruption
mutants that induced increased IL-1β release encode phospho-relay sensor histidine kinases (phkA and fhk3),
a sub-class of protein kinases that directly sense environmental and intracellular changes and subsequently
activate stress response signaling. The molecular pathways controlled by PhkA and Fhk3 are unknown, as both
HKs are largely uncharacterized. Although a major consequence of HK signaling is activation of stress responses
pathways that upregulate transcription factor activity to respond to environmental stimuli, the downstream
transcriptional effectors for all A. fumigatus HKs remain undescribed. Our work will delineate A. fumigatus
histidine kinase (HK)-dependent mechanisms of host response (Aim 1) and identify A. fumigatus transcriptional
regulators of inflammasome activation (Aim 2). Through completion of the proposed Aims, we will delineate
fungal molecular pathways mediating Aspergillus-induced host response. This work is essential for future
development of novel therapeutic approaches targeted towards activating protection against invasive infections
or mitigating harmful host-response during chronic infections."

In this proposed research project, we seek to develop an advanced brain SPECT system that offers a
unique hyperspectral imaging capability substantiated by an excellent energy resolution (e.g., <2.5 keV at 140
keV and <3.5 keV at 250 keV) across a wide energy range (25-600 keV), and at the same time deliver a 1-
mm spatial resolution and a very high sensitivity to allow detailed visualization of multi-tracer uptakes in
various brain regions. This device could potentially have a transformative impact on brain research by allowing
for microscopic, multi-functional assessment of brain functions under various experimental conditions.
This proposed research project will integrate the disruptive high-performance 3D CZT imaging-spectrometer
technologies with a novel synthetic compound eye (SCE) camera design, as well as an innovative iterative
image reconstruction method using deep-learning based priors, to develop a next-generation clinical brain
SPECT imaging system with transformative spatial resolution and imaging sensitivity unattainable previously.
The long-term objective is to apply this innovative imaging system to human brain SPECT studies using a
collection of various SPECT radiotracers, and develop and advance physiological parametric imaging
methodologies, in order to investigate the long-standing issues in neurobiology and improve our
understanding of the interplay and relationship among cerebral blood flow and perfusion, brain tissue
oxygenation, neuronal cell metabolism, and brain cell tracking under different cognitive challenges and
biophysical conditions in healthy and in disease. We would envision the proposed system to serve as a
unique imaging platform to significantly advance our understanding of neural cell biology and regional
brain functions in response to various cognitive, behavioral, and physiological challenges by employing these
unprecedentedly innovative SPECT imaging methodologies in order to assess all relevant quantitative
physiological measurements that will be interpreted in an integrated fashion and synergistically so that new
perspectives in brain research unattainable previously can be formulated."
10728341,"Background. Sepsis—life-threatening organ dysfunction triggered by infection—hospitalizes more than
25,000 Veterans each year, making it the 2nd most common reason for hospitalization in the VA. While
most Veterans survive the acute episode, many suffer poor longer term outcomes. Approximately 1 in 3
survivors die in the year following sepsis, 1 in 5 have a potentially preventable rehospitalization, and 1
in 6 experience severe persistent physical or cognitive impairments. The dramatic increase in sepsis
from COVID-19 brings new urgency to optimizing sepsis survivorship, but also new opportunity to learn
from hospitals implementing recovery-focused practices to address the needs of Veterans surviving
viral sepsis from SARS-CoV-2.
Significance. Despite the prevalence of long-term morbidity after sepsis, there are no treatment
guidelines focused on enhancing recovery from sepsis. OVeR-Sepsis will meet an urgent clinical need
in VA, enhancing the recovery of the thousands of Veterans who survive sepsis each year (including
viral sepsis from COVID). OVeR-Sepsis will validate best practices for enhancing recovery from sepsis
that are responsive to Veteran and caregiver perspectives and identify feasible strategies for
implementation. We will make these tools freely available, easy to use, and promote them nationally to
encourage their use.
Innovation and Impact. OVeR-Sepsis is innovative by studying sepsis survivorship systematically and
broadly. We will study survivorship from both COVID and non-COVID sepsis, and consider how
innovation in COVID sepsis survivorship practices can inform practice for non-COVID sepsis survivors.
Our sequential explanatory mixed methods approach, with video site visits for 4-6 top- and 4-6 bottom-
performing sites for sepsis survivorship, will allow us to study of clinical practices and implementation
strategies that differentiate top-performing sites. We will then incorporate qualitative findings from our
site visits into the evidence synthesis informing a modified Delphi panel to assess best practices for
sepsis recovery.
Specific Aims. (A1) Identify top- and bottom-performing VA hospitals for 90-day survival and quality of
life after sepsis. (A2) Define practices that differentiate top-performing hospitals through electronic
health record analysis, surveys, and video site visits. (A3) Prioritize best practices for sepsis recovery
based on validity, improvement opportunity, and feasibility.
Methodology. We will measure risk-standardized 90-day survival from sepsis across VA hospitals
using hierarchical regression models and 2017-2020 CDW data. We will then empanel a cohort of
N=600 Veterans from (25 Veterans per hospital, from 12 higher- and 12-lower survival hospitals) to
measure quality of life and disability using telephone survey instruments with proxy respondent options.
From those, we will select 4-6 top-performing (higher survival, high quality of life) and 4-6 bottom-
performing hospitals for 360-degree video site visits. Through quantitative analyses of select practices,
survey of current practices, and semi-structured interviews with a diverse set of 12-15 informants
(clinicians, administrators, Veterans, caregivers), we will identify “best practices” for sepsis recovery
and associated implementation strategies. Using a modified Delphi panel of experts, we will assess the
validity, improvement opportunity, and feasibility of these best practices.
Next Steps/Implementation. Upon successful completion of this research, we will work with our
operational partners—who we have included even in the design stage of this IIR—to implement these
best practices."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have markedly transformed the therapeutic landscape for many types of
advanced malignancies over the past decade. A sizable proportion of patients with advanced cancer derive
durable benefits from ICIs and achieve longer periods of progression-free survival or remission than previously
possible. Yet we still know little about the determinants of durable response to ICI treatment and the symptom
trajectory and survivorship needs of this growing patient population. We thus propose a multi-institute study
with two sister cohorts of patients living with advanced cancers. First, a retrospective EHR data-only cohort will
include 8,860 patients with advanced disease, inclusive of all cancer types, who have been treated with ICI-
based immunotherapy in 2014-2022. This large cohort will allow us to identify and study durable responders to
ICIs, defined as patients who achieve partial or complete response to ICI treatment and live at least one year
after ICI treatment initiation. Second, a prospective cohort will enroll and actively follow an estimated 1,200
patients with durable response to ICI treatment for advanced lung cancer, kidney cancer, and melanoma, the
three most common cancers treated with ICIs. Clinical and patient-reported outcome data will be collected at
baseline and every 6 months during follow up. This prospective cohort will allow us to study long-term survival
and physical and psychosocial symptom trajectories in patients with durable response to ICIs, and to identify
clinical and modifiable behavioral factors predictive of long-term survival and common side effects of ICI
treatment. The predictors identified in these analyses will be independently validated in the DiRECT Cohort, a
large ongoing study of racial disparities in ICI treatment led by the study team. Our Specific Aims are:
1. In the retrospective EHR data-only cohort, 1a) Determine the proportion of patients who had durable
 response to ICI treatment (partial/complete response and alive ≥1 year since initial ICI treatment) and chart
 their survival trajectory; 1b) Identify clinical predictors for durable response to ICI treatment; 1c). In the
 independent DiRECT Cohort, validate the clinical predictors for durable response to ICI treatment.
2. In the prospective cohort, 2a) Identify long-term survival and longitudinal trajectories of patients' physical
 and psychosocial symptoms after ICI treatment; 2b) Investigate the relationships of long-term survival and
 common side effects from ICI treatment with multidimensional predictors; 2c). In the independent DiRECT
 Cohort, validate the predictors for survival and common side effects in patients with durable response.
Findings from our study will provide much-needed data that can inform new evidence-based intervention
strategies as the next step to optimize survivorship care and extend and improve quality of life for the growing
population of survivors living after a diagnosis of advanced cancer due to ICI treatment."
10895559,"Project Summary
Nanosized extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) have been identified as an important means for cells to
communicate with neighboring and distant cells. EVPs are actively investigated to understand their roles in
cancer, non-invasive disease diagnosis, and therapeutics. One of the most significant urgent challenges to
overcome in EVP research is understanding the heterogeneity of EVPs. EVPs are heterogeneous in their size
and molecular cargo contents. As a result, single EVP analysis has been identified as crucial to deciphering the
heterogeneity of individual EVPs and understanding their biological roles in diverse diseases. As an example,
an ongoing scientific question concerns whether the newly discovered extracellular particles called exomeres
and supermeres are monolithic nanoparticles enriched with multiple makers such as proteins, RNA and lipids or
if they are a distribution of different functionally-active nanoparticles (such as proteins, nucleic acid and lipids)
co-isolated together. The widely used analysis techniques such as mass spectrometry are incapable of analyzing
individual EVPs and hence these assays mask the impact of the heterogeneity of EVPs, which has made it
impossible to address this question and other open questions to date. To select individual EVs for analysis in a
non-destructive manner, it is imperative to develop methods for trapping them in solution. Optical tweezers
recently recognized with a 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics have been demonstrated as effective approaches for
trapping single cells and larger EVs. Unfortunately, the diffraction limit of light precludes their use for the trapping
of single nanosized EVs, and the recently discovered exomeres, and supermeres that are only 35 nm and 25
nm in diameter, respectively. This MIRA research program is comprised of a collection of projects designed to
develop new optical nanotweezer technologies for high throughput parallelized trapping of single nanosized
EVPs combined with enhanced Raman analysis to provide unique information on the global biomolecular
composition of individual nanosized EVs, exomeres and supermeres. Subsequently, we will investigate the use
of these tools to address ongoing controversies in EV research.
First, we will develop a novel optical nanotweezer approach based on nanoplasmonic structures that will enable:
(i) parallelized trapping of thousands of single EVPs within seconds; (ii) enhancement and acquisition of Raman
signals from single trapped EVPs nondestructively while they are trapped in solution near nanoplasmonic
cavities; and (iii) biomolecular component analysis to determine the global biomolecular composition of individual
trapped EVPs. Secondly, we will utilize the developed technologies to address ongoing questions in EVP
research including whether the newly discovered exomeres and supermeres are monolithic or comprise a
diverse distribution of functionally active nanoparticles. The pertinent findings to be obtained from the proposed
research program will greatly improve our ability to understand the heterogeneity of EVPs, address ongoing
controversies and guide the nature of future scientific questions to be investigated in the EVP research field."
10930829,"Project Description
To perform their multitude of functions, proteins often bring—distal in sequence—residues together and fold
into reproducible higher-order structures (HOS). Ensuring the integrity of this orientation or intentionally
modulating it through post-translational modification (PTM) are vital processes that are known to be perturbed
in cancers, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases. Characterizing how PTM alters protein HOS can
be employed to identify disease state and inform and accelerate the design of new targeted therapeutic
interventions. Thus, to improve diagnostic capabilities, drug development, and provide insight into the
fundamental mechanisms driving cellular function and disease, developing techniques capable of
characterizing all the various PTM-modulated HOSs that exist for each protein is vitally important. The
sensitivity, high-throughput nature, and low sample requirements of mass spectrometry (MS) has increasingly
led to its adoption as a tool to measure protein HOS and PTM. Unfortunately, the most employed workflow,
bottom-up proteomics, demands proteolytic digestion of the analyte and thus, it is not possible to distinguish
the proteoform from which any single peptide is derived. Therefore, bottom-up workflows report the average
conformation of all existing proteoforms and the average occupancy of all PTMs. Thus, to precisely assess the
PTM-based regulation of protein function, over the next five years, we propose to develop new technologies
that couple top-down proteomics, ion mobility spectrometry, chemical derivatization, and collision-induced
unfolding. These new methods will be developed using well characterized model protein systems prior to
application to more complex biological systems. The combination of these techniques will offer significant
insight into these critical regulatory processes. In addition to these biological insights, we anticipate that this
research proposal will generate a series of MS-based analytical techniques and an assortment of chemical
reagents that will be applicable to a wide range of protein systems."
10889256,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
We propose to use single cell studies of clinical isolates to explicate how mutations and differentiation status
coordinately regulate cell state, clonal expansion and malignant transformation. We will model sequential
activation/inactivation of somatic mutations in defined cell compartments and perform functional studies to
uncover critical gene networks and therapeutic dependencies. This will include single cell studies in primary
patient samples, use of innovative models which allow for sequential mutational activation/inactivation, and
functional genomic approaches to delineate mechanisms of transformation and novel therapeutic dependencies.
Moreover, we will delineate crosstalk between different cell types in normal and malignant hematopoiesis and
how these interactions impact therapeutic response. These tools will be distributed widely to enable studies of
tissue development/homeostasis, cell state changes, transformation, and therapeutic dependencies."

Older Latinx adults in the US are at a greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related
dementias (ADRD). They exhibit a faster cognitive decline than non-Hispanic whites. However, they remain
vastly underrepresented in research studies to characterize risk factors associated with progressive cognitive
decline. A better understanding of risk factors can provide better treatment and design appropriate preventive
strategies for older Latinx adults. Since older Latinx adults have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk
factors, their risk of developing ADRD is high in old age. Older Latinx communities were disproportionately
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which can increase their risk for neurological disorders. This UH2/UH3
cooperative agreement aims to engage and develop the infrastructure for a new Latinx cohort study with the
following aims: (1) build infrastructure, community outreach, and the external advisory board for a new Latinx
cohort; (2) develop ongoing engagement with the community and resource sharing plan; (3) collect data on
250 Latinx participants from East Side sampling frame; and (4) test the exploratory hypotheses that Latinx
participants have a higher prevalence of clinically diagnosed AD and MCI, and the impact of COVID-19 on AD
is more severe compared to non-Hispanic whites, and the ApoE4 association with clinical AD and MCI is the
same as NHW. The long-term objective is to perform a sizeable muti-ethnic study, combining the Latinx cohort
with our existing Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), a population-based community study in four
neighborhoods with 10,801 participants with 63% non-Hispanic Black and 37% non-Hispanic white
participants. This UH2/UH3 proposal will add a new Latinx cohort in the East Side community of Chicago, with
over 60% Latinx. A multi-ethnic cohort will allow us to test several biological and psychosocial hypotheses of
high public health significance. The collection of biospecimens will also allow for testing further blood
biomarker hypotheses, developing an omics pipeline down the road, and providing additional infrastructure for
pathology studies in a population-based cohort study with minorities."

Despite progress in understanding the molecular basis of childhood malignancies, cancer remains the leading
cause of disease-related death in school age children. Moreover, we are still treating these children with old
approaches, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, each with associated morbidities.
Several roadblocks have hampered progress in treating children with cancer. First, cancer-promoting targets,
such as transcription factor fusion oncoproteins, are quite common in pediatrics but make for challenging drug
targets. Second, pediatric malignancies tend to have fewer mutations than adult cancers resulting in a
decreased likelihood of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. In sharp contrast, immune checkpoint
inhibitors have transformed therapy for subsets of adult cancers. Third, there is a market disincentive for
pharmaceutical companies to work on targets that are exclusive to pediatric cancers. Academic investigators
must take the lead in de-risking these high priority pediatric targets through comprehensive target validation
and identification of initial chemical leads. I am an investigator willing and equipped to take such a risk.
I am a physician-scientist, pediatric oncologist innovator and have dedicated my career to the goal of precision
pediatric oncology medicine. The time is right to tackle these vexing challenges in childhood cancer therapy
development. I will focus predominantly on fusion-driven acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and the fusion-
driven pediatric solid tumor Ewing sarcoma, two areas of deep expertise in my laboratory. The first objective of
my future research program is to target oncogenic fusions in pediatric cancers. We will pioneer new strategies
of targeted protein degradation to validate and mechanistically dissect their role in tumor maintenance and to
develop inhibitors/degraders that will ultimately inform new therapies. I have led innovative chemical and
functional genomic approaches to identify therapeutic targets for childhood cancer, such as the first Pediatric
Cancer Dependency Map, genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening in over 100 pediatric cancer models. Novel
pediatric specific targets and innovative therapeutic concepts have emerged and will be the focus of our
second objective. We aim to deeply understand these targets mechanistically and to identify chemical
perturbagens of the top priority dependencies by deploying innovative chemical biology strategies. My third
objective leverages my expertise in functional genomics and epigenetics to identify and drug the regulators of
key targets of immunotherapies in childhood cancer. My success in these bold endeavors will be ensured by a
collaborative team of world-class chemists, structural biologists, immunologists, and epigenetics experts. The
discovery of drugs that target pediatric oncogenic fusions and other novel Achilles heels, and the converting of
unresponsive childhood malignancies to immunotherapy responsive, would truly be paradigm shifting for
children suffering from these diseases."
10892863,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to 20% - or nearly 7,000,000 – adults with diabetes (T2DM) concurrently experience disordered eating
behaviors (DEBs, e.g., significant overeating with loss of control), resulting in higher body mass index and lower
adherence to diet and exercise recommendations. DEBs are often disregarded by medical providers and
patients, and therefore undertreated in clinical settings. Research is limited on whether treatment for DEBs
impacts diabetes self-management and glycemic functioning. To address this, we developed the Balanced and
Empowered EaTing (BEET) in Diabetes, or the BEET Diabetes Program, a novel cognitive-behavioral therapy-
based program to designed to specifically treat DEBs in T2DM and improve diabetes self-management. By
designing with implementation science methods and engaging integrated behavioral health providers (BHPs) in
real clinical settings, we aim to 1) address an important treatment need for people with T2DM and concurrent
DEBs, and 2) improve the integration of BHPs in collaborative diabetes care in clinical settings.
Candidate and Mentors: I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of
Colorado. As a clinical health psychologist with training in implementation science methods, my program of
research aims to implement and evaluate evidence-based programs for mental health conditions that could
worsen diabetes and other endocrinopathies. I have built a strong mentorship team to guide my training including
primary mentor, Dr. C. Neill Epperson (neuroendocrinology of risk and resilience), and co-mentor, Dr. Bethany
Kwan (dissemination & implementation science).
Research and Training: I propose short term scientific, educational, and training goals that will build upon my
prior research training through three research aims: 1) engage BHPs to refine the BEET Diabetes Program for
implementation in clinical settings, 2) evaluate the feasibility of the BEET Diabetes Program, and 3) determine
the reach and estimate the effectiveness of the BEET Diabetes Program on patient-reported and clinical
outcomes. The complementary training goals to establish scientific independence through training in: 1)
advanced mixed-methods analytical skills by learning configurational comparative methods for implementation
science, 2) clinical trial design for behavioral research and longitudinal data analysis, and 3) methods for
biological data collection, analysis, and interpretation in T2DM.
Summary: DEBs in T2DM are a serious yet under-recognized clinical problem. There is a significant dearth of
research examining associated risk factors and treatments of DEBs in T2DM. My ultimate career goal is to
transform our approach to the prevention of endocrine- and metabolic-conditions by developing and
implementing evidence-based mental/behavioral programs in clinical settings. Completion of this career
development award will accelerate my path towards becoming a national expert in the biobehavioral
management of endocrinopathies."

MAIN 1
It is increasingly appreciated that multiple biological, psychological and sociocultural factors contribute to sex
differences in alcohol consumption and associated health consequences in humans. The three main sex
biasing biological factors, including sex chromosome complement and organizational and activational effects of
gonadal hormones, can independently and interactively influence behavior, including ethanol consumption and
preference. In work using the four core genotypes mice, in which sex chromosome complement and gonadal
type segregate independently, we found that these two factors interact on ethanol intake during a limited
access period when assessed in early adolescence. In this renewal period, we seek to test the hypothesis that
sex chromosome complement affects the escalation of ethanol consumption that occurs across a chronic
adolescent intermittent access period in a manner that depends upon the gonadal milieu. Additionally, we will
assess the contributions of sex differences in ethanol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in these
effects. Based upon recent work from our group demonstrating sexually dimorphic consequences of
adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure on nucleus accumbens dopamine release, we will additionally
examine how adolescent ethanol drinking affects this neurotransmitter system, and whether dysregulation of
extrahypothalamic oxytocin release contributes to these observed effects. Finally, we will measure the impact
of adolescent ethanol drinking on expression of X-chromosome genes that escape inactivation and that may
causally contribute to sex chromosome complement effects on ethanol responsiveness. By conducting this
integrated set of behavioral, neurochemical and genetic studies, we will develop a more comprehensive
understanding of the mechanisms by which the major sex biasing biological factors regulate escalated ethanol
drinking during adolescence and its consequences for brain and behavior."

Tissue Bank, which is under the same director (Dr. R. Anders) as this proposed Pathology Core, to establish a
collection of properly banked liver tissue and biological fluids. The tissue samples will range from formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded and frozen tissues available from liver transplantation specimens which will be linked
to clinical data. This Pathology Core will collect high quality snap frozen and formalin fixed samples from liver
transplant patients. The biospecimens will be harvested and banked in accordance with the National Cancer
Institute’s Best Practice Guidelines for Biorepositories. Distribution of these specimens to project investigators
will be coordinated by the Pathology Core director. This CORE will procure specimens under the supervision of
a pathologist with expertise in hepatopathology and in close collaboration with surgeons, transplant
hepatologists and basic research investigators to maximize translational impact of the projects. This proposed
CORE will leverage existing database framework, specimen distribution and prioritization systems that
originated from existing SPORES. Specifically, we will have clinical histories linked to pathologic data in a

10863914,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sjögren’s disease is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by immune-mediated
destruction of salivary and lacrimal glands leading to profound dry mouth and associated oral
health complications, vision-threatening dry eye disease, and decreased quality of life. The
immunological mechanisms of Sjögren’s are poorly understood, and no disease-modifying
therapies have been identified. There is a critical need to define the early immunological
mechanisms to identify targets for earlier diagnostics and more effective therapies. Diagnosis
occurs years after initiation of the autoimmune process making the study of early mechanisms
impractical in humans. Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop salivary gland
autoimmunity with features similar to Sjögren’s in humans including the characteristic focal
lymphocytic sialadenitis that is a hallmark of Sjögren’s in humans. We have recently found that
gene-editing to disrupt the Tyk2 gene in NOD mice prevents salivary gland inflammation in a
lymphocyte-extrinsic manner. Tyk2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase associated with several
inflammatory cytokines, and TYK2 gene variants are associated with Sjögren’s in humans. Our
goals in this proposal are to define the specific innate immune cell subsets and the upstream
cytokines that require Tyk2-mediated signaling for the development of autoimmune salivary
gland disease. Our central hypothesis is that interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 signaling through
Tyk2 in antigen presenting cells within the salivary glands are required to drive the focal
lymphocytic sialadenitis. The specific aims to test this hypothesis are: (1) Identify cells that
require Tyk2 signaling for salivary gland inflammation in NOD mice; (2) Define the requirements
for IL-12 and IL-23 in the development of focal lymphocytic sialadenitis. We will use the NOD
mouse-based spontaneous disease model, genetically edited NOD strains, our adoptive transfer
model, bone marrow chimeras, in vitro cultures, and in vivo cytokine-blocking therapies to
perform these studies. The significant positive impact of completing these studies include
defining the mechanisms by which Tyk2 and associated cytokines drive salivary gland
autoimmunity, which will lead to development of early diagnostic biomarkers and identification of
immune proteins that can be targeted therapeutically in Sjögren’s. Notably, inhibitors of Tyk2
are in development, and IL-12 and IL-23 blocking therapies are already available to treat other
autoimmune diseases. Identifying the roles of Tyk2 and associated cytokines in Sjögren’s will
help guide future studies of Tyk2 and associated cytokine blocking therapies in subsets of
individuals with Sjögren’s."

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a chronic disorder causing disabling symptoms and
substantial loss of productivity. Not all POTS patients are the same, and the causes and significance of different
subtypes are not known. For example, some patients may have abnormal regulation of their immune system while
others may have problems with the response of their muscles to activity. Exercise training has been shown to be a
beneficial treatment for POTS, but about 25% of patients are unable to complete the exercise program.
Our research study will examine the different types of POTS by systematically and comprehensively studying a
large diverse group of patients. This will include careful assessment of symptoms, blood tests, and heart structure
as well as a detailed analysis of the muscle response to exercise. This study will be the first to define the full picture
of different POTS subtypes and the relationship between these subtypes. Our studies will allow clinicians to better
evaluate and individualize treatment and will guide future POTS research."
10726594,"During the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, thousands of service personnel suffered mild traumatic
brain injuries (mTBIs), those that do not cause gross anatomical damage or hemorrhage and produce only
brief periods of altered awareness. Although these brain injuries are classified as “mild,” many veterans with
mTBI experience short- and long-term neurological dysfunction including epilepsy and somatosensory (SS)
dysregulation that may underlie pain/headache. We urgently need new mTBI therapies.
 Most previous investigations of mTBI pathophysiology focused on injury effects on the histology, physiology
and cellular biology of neurons in small brain regions near a point of focal injury. However, explosive blasts
impacting widespread brain regions comprise most modern combat mTBIs and thus there is often no single
point of focal injury. Moreover, new data suggest that dysfunction of large-scale brain networks (spatially
separate, but functionally connected brain regions) lead to epilepsy and SS processing disorders. Therefore, it
is critical to determine the effects of mTBI on large scale brain networks and if therapeutically modulating
network physiology (e.g. brain stimulation) reduces seizures and their comorbidities. Previous studies in
nontraumatic patients and animal models demonstrated that abnormal physiology within SS thalamocortical
(ssTC) and somatosensory corticocortical (ssCC) networks are strongly associated with focal and generalized
seizures and SS processing disorders. Therefore, it is likely that mTBI will also alter ssCC and ssTC
physiology to produce epilepsy and SS dysregulation.
 Genetic risk factors likely play an important role in the development of post-mTBI seizures. A family history
of epilepsy increases the risk of post-mTBI epilepsy from 1.5-2.2-fold to 5.8-fold risk and epidemiology studies
suggest that 9.3% mTBI patients have a first degree relative with epilepsy. To develop network-specific
therapies (e.g. neurostimulation), it is necessary to know whether mTBI causes different epileptogenic changes
in ssTC and ssCC networks in genetically susceptible individuals.
 This application will test the overarching hypothesis that mTBI alters the activity and
connectivity of ssCC and ssTC networks to produce post-mTBI seizures and SS dysfunction and that these
changes are greater in subjects with genetic vulnerabilities. This hypothesis will be tested using a top-down
clinically translatable approach to determine the effects of mTBI on 1) seizures/SS function (Aim 1), 2) long-
range ssCC connectivity using high density EEG (HdEEG, Aim2 A/B) and 3) ssTC connectivity by
HdEEG/stereotactic EEG (SEEG, Aim 2C). Importantly, (Aim 3) primary somatosensory cortex (S1) activity will
then be causally manipulated to determine the effects on ssCC/ssTC network connectivity and seizures and to
extend the observations beyond mere correlation and provide a foundation for future studies of network-
specific modulation therapies (e.g. neurostimulation). The hypothesis will be tested using wild type (WT) mice
as well as the PI’s novel mouse model with heterozygous (Het) expression of a human epilepsy risk gene
(Gabra1A322D). Aim 1 will determine the effects of mTBI on seizures and somatosensory function in WT and
Het mice. Early and long-term effects of mTBI on (A) seizures quantified on continuous EEG monitoring and
(B) SS function measured by neurobehavioral testing. Aim 2 will elucidate the effect of mTBI on ssTC and
ssCC networks in WT and Het mice. The PI’s established HdEEG method will be compared with an innovative
minimally invasive MXene HdEEG arrays for determining ssCC network activity and connectivity in mTBI
subjects. Next, the effects of mTBI on ssCC (B) and ssTC (C) network physiology with HdEEG (B) and
HdEEG/SEEG (C) recordings will be determined. Finally, aim 3 will determine the effects of S1
neurostimulation on post mTBI ssCC/ssTC network connectivity and seizures using A) open loop and B)
closed loop stimulation."
10726595,"Renal-specific thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) represents the most severe manifestation of renal endothelial
injury consisting of endothelial cell (EC) swelling, subEC expansion, inflammation and microthrombi and
untreated progresses uniformly to chronic kidney disease. TMA occurs subsequent to various etiologies including
hemolytic uremic syndrome, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, malignant hypertension and
antibody mediated rejection after transplant, and despite diverse causes, is typically associated with
dysregulation of key thrombotic and inflammatory EC transcripts and complement activation. Furthermore,
expression of membrane bound (DAF, CD59, CD46) complement regulators, is altered in many subtypes of TMA
and it is unclear whether this is a driver or consequence of injury. To investigate the mechanism(s) by which
complement activation and EC transcripts are dysregulated in TMA, we reviewed expression arrays of RNA-
sequencing from kidney biopsies with TMA, and observed that Krüppel-Like Factor 4 (KLF4), a zinc finger
transcription factor, is the highest differentially expressed transcript. Previous studies demonstrate that KLF4 is
a critical mediator of anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory phenotype in systemic vascular beds, but its role
modulating renal microvascular injury and complement activation in TMA remains to be investigated. Based on
this and our preliminary data, my central hypothesis, that EC-KLF4 is required to prevent complement-dependent
and independent renal microvascular EC injury in TMA, will be investigated by the following specific aims: 1)
Determine the renoprotective role of EC-specific KLF4 in TMA; 2) Test the hypothesis that KLF4-DAF interaction
is required to mitigate complement activation in TMA; and 3) Investigate the mechanism(s) by which KLF4
attenuates renal microvascular EC injury in TMA. Under subaim 1A, we will determine whether mice with the
inducible loss of EC-Klf4 (iKlf4ΔEC) have accelerated renal EC injury and complement activation using two murine
TMA models (anti-VEGFR2 Ab and Shiga toxin). In subaim 1B, the protective role of KLF4 will be determined
using mice with EC-overexpression of KLF4 subjected to VEGFR2 inhibition. Extent of injury will be evaluated
by histology, ultrastructure and functional measures, as well as inflammatory and thrombotic transcripts and
complement activation. In subaim 2.A., we will evaluate the mechanism of interaction between KLF4 and DAF
using ChIP assay and luciferase reporter. In subaim 2.B., we will test whether mice with EC-Daf knockdown
have increased susceptibility to EC complement activation by treating them with a VEGFR2 inhibitor and crossing
them with Klf4ΔEC mice in two experiments. In subaim 2.C, we will perform IF for DAF and C3 in human biopsies
TMA specimens to corroborate our findings. Finally, in aim 3, we will investigate the mechanism(s) by which
KLF4 attenuates EC injury via complement dependent (subaim 3.A), and independent (subaim 3.B) manner
using small-molecule C5aR and PAI-1 inhibitors in primary glomerular ECs and human microvascular ECs.
 This project will be carried out at the Northport Veterans Affairs Medical Center (NVAMC) under the
primary mentorship of Dr. Sandeep Mallipattu (Chief of Nephrology, Stony Brook Medicine (SBM) and Staff
Nephrologist NVAMC), an expert in glomerular diseases and co-mentorship of Dr. Vincent Yang (Chair of
Medicine at SBM), an expert in KLF pathobiology, and Dr. Berhane Ghebrehiwet, an expert in complement. All
mentors are experienced, federally funded investigators and will guide my career development along with an
external advisory committee. The completion of proposed project and career development plan will allow the
fulfillment of my short-term goal of uncovering mechanisms of glomerular EC sensitivity to complement activation
and injury and long-term goals of becoming a productive, independent physician-scientist, practicing nephrology
(25%) and performing translational and basic science (75%), at the NVAMC. In addition to robust clinical training,
I have the necessary research foundation to fulfill these goals including: 1) Post-doctoral nephrology research
training 2) Masters in Clinical Research 3) Demonstrated publication and grant application success."
10899690,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cardiomyopathy and heart failure are leading causes of morbidity and mortality world-wide. In
addition to ventricular dysfunction, heart-failure associated ventricular arrhythmias cause sudden
death with few disease-modifying therapies. Changes in myocardial conduction, increased fibrosis,
alterations of ion channel characteristics and genetic susceptibilities have all been postulated to
underlie the increased risk of arrhythmia in heart failure, but no unifying mechanism is known. Post-
translational modifications (PTMs) of cardiac proteins have emerged as critical factors in mediating
normal physiologic function or leading to heart disease when dysregulated. Recently mutations in the
N-terminal acetyltransferase complex type A (NatA) have been identified in patients with congenital
heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia. This protein complex acetylates the N-terminus of
nascent proteins regulating stability, subcellular localization, and complex formation, with nearly 40%
of the proteome as potential targets. We have recently identified a large family with a novel mutation
in the catalytic subunit of NatA, NAA10. Male patients have severely prolonged QTs, recurrent
arrhythmias, developmental delay, learning disabilities, and cardiomyopathy, with female patients
more variably affected. We created models of NAA10 dysfunction using induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) derived from several affected male patients. Electrophysiologic analysis of differentiated
iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) demonstrated action potential duration (APD)
prolongation, abnormalities of sarcomeric structure, calcium handling and corresponding
dysregulation of sodium and potassium currents. Establishing a network of collaborators, we
investigated the mechanism of NAA10 dysfunction and developed an animal model for cardiac-
specific ablation of NAA10. We propose to use our scalable model systems to investigate the
currently unknown role of N-terminal acetylation within the heart as an entry point to understanding
the mechanisms of arrhythmia risk in heart failure. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism of how
N-terminal acetylation regulates sodium and potassium ion channels along with the discovery of other
target proteins. In Aim 2, we will use recently developed murine models to selectively ablate Naa10
and the paralogue Naa12 within the heart to determine the causative mechanisms of N-terminal
acetylation in heart failure and arrhythmogenesis. In Aim 3, we examine the contribution of N-terminal
acetylation in acquired forms of heart disease including human heart failure. This transformative
proposal will provide novel mechanistic insight into the poorly understood role of N-terminal
acetylation in cardiovascular disease with potential for improved arrhythmia risk stratification and
therapeutic development."
11140581,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance use in pregnancy, including illicit substances and alcohol, is a critical public health problem,
affecting 1 in 10 pregnancies. Because of the opioid crisis, there were recent exponential increases in
diagnoses of maternal opioid use disorder and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. In parallel, the rate of
infants entering foster care nationwide grew 25% from 2011 to 2017; infants now account for one fifth of
annual foster placements. At present, infants are the fastest growing group entering foster care, most due to
parental substance use. The rise of infants in the US foster system garnered public attention leading to recent
federal policy changes that aimed to prevent foster placement where possible by connecting caregivers to
treatment for substance use disorder and mitigating postnatal adverse outcomes by providing wrap-around
services through Plans of Safe Care (POSC). However, state responses to changes in federal policy have
been disjointed, and research to date remains unclear as to whether these policies achieved their stated goal
or had unintended consequences such as exacerbating underlying racial disproportionality in the system. This
study aims to evaluate child welfare policy interventions and local factors to improve the wellbeing of pregnant
people with substance use disorder and their infants by: 1) conducting a rigorous analysis of state statutes,
regulations, and guidance related to POSC and categorizing POSC components likely to influence the
implementation of services (e.g., treatment, postnatal supports); 2) determining if state POSC policies were
associated with reductions in infant foster placements and emergency department visits for injury from abuse
and whether implementation of POSC was associated with changes to racial and ethnic disproportionality in
infant foster placement; and 3) qualitatively investigating the contextual barriers and facilitators influencing the
implementation of POSC and exploring elements of POSC implementation associated with improving or
worsening racial and ethnic equity through interviews with key stakeholders (e.g., frontline case workers,
judges, clinicians, policymakers)."
10920489,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal progressive fibrotic disease characterized with excessively deposited
extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Persistent myofibroblast activation is considered as one of driving forces
that lead to excessive ECM protein production and fibrosis in IPF. The molecular mechanisms that perpetuate
persistent myofibroblast activation and pro-fibrotic responses in IPF have not been fully understood. KH-Type
Splicing Regulatory Protein (KSRP) is a mRNA destabilizing protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation of
gene expression. Preliminary data demonstrate that KSRP expression is significantly decreased in IPF lung
fibroblasts and tissues when compared to that in normal human lung fibroblasts and tissues. However, the role
of KSRP in lung fibrosis, and the functional consequences of pathologic KSRP downregulation in pro-fibrotic
responses in IPF, are completely unknown. This proposal aims to reveal the novel restrictive role of KSRP in
lung fibrosis and the molecular mechanisms involved. Preliminary data demonstrate that KSRP deficient mice
have increased lung fibrosis when compared to wild-type mice in response to Bleomycin, and that KSRP
deficiency promotes, while gain of KSRP inhibits, myofibroblast differentiation and ECM protein production.
These data indicate that KSRP functions as a restricting factor of fibrotic reactions, and impaired KSRP function
promotes fibrotic reactions and lung fibrosis. Furthermore, KSRP negatively regulates Migfilin mRNA stability
and expression and KSRP deficiency results in increased Migfilin expression. Our preliminary data demonstrate
that Migfilin functions as a “pro-fibrotic switch”, promoting pro-fibrotic reactions. Migfilin is required for
myofibroblast differentiation and survival. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that KSRP functions as a
restrictive regulator of lung fibrosis, and that impaired KSRP function fosters a “pro-fibrotic niche” fueling
persistent myofibroblast differentiation and pro-fibrotic responses mediated by Migfilin and Migfilin mediated
signaling. To test the hypothesis, three specific AIMs are proposed. Specific AIM 1 will determine the
mechanisms by which KSRP regulates myofibroblast differentiation and survival. Specific AIM 2 will determine
the restrictive role of KSRP in controlling ECM expression and matrix assembly. Specific AIM 3 will examine the
in vivo cell-specific role of KSRP in fibrogenesis and functional consequences. The findings will help to
understand the mechanisms that perpetuate persistent myofibroblast activation and pro-fibrotic responses in IPF
and serve my long-term goal to develop effective therapy for IPF."
10932957,"To date, significant efforts devoted to developing breast cancer risk prediction models that produce modest
discriminatory accuracy in the range of 59-68% and underperform in Black women compared to non-Hispanic
white (NHW) women, limiting their clinical impact on equitable precision-based/personalized breast cancer
prevention and screening. Emerging data suggest that deep learning (DL) models based on mammographic
images outperform traditional breast cancer risk prediction models based on clinical and risk factors and breast
density alone. Yet there remain major gaps to resolve before widespread roll out of DL methods in order to
enhance outcomes and reduce health disparities in breast cancer. These models have been developed in
clinical or screening cohorts and require further validation in “real world” settings. Equally unknown is how
performance of MDL risk models may differ between Black and NHW women, as few previous studies included
sufficient numbers of Black women for meaningful interpretation. Finally, the combination of polygenic risk
scores (PRS) and MDL risk scores could significantly improve clinical utility of these risk stratification tools, yet
MDL and PRS clinical rollout are largely being evaluated separately, primarily due to lack of availability of both
mammographic and genetic data in the same study population. We propose to leverage existing unparalleled
resources from two complementary national cohorts, the Sister Study and the Black Women’s Health Study,
with digital screening mammograms, genomic data, and extensive epidemiologic and clinical data to address
these evidence gaps (ncases, 971; ncontrols, 8793). In Aim 1, we will validate the performance and clinical risk
stratification of Mirai, a published MDL model with the highest accuracy in screening cohorts to date, in our
epidemiologic cohorts. In addition to considering breast cancer risk overall, we will evaluate performance of
this MDL model for early and advanced stage and for ER+ and ER– breast cancer, outcomes with significant
clinical implications for prognosis and treatment. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the addition of PRS to MDL risk
scores in improving risk stratification, and determine net reclassification. In Aim 3, we will determine whether
MDL models perform equally well and impacts risk stratification within strata of breast density, as defined in
widespread implementation of breast density notification legislation (dense vs. non-dense). These results may
provide crucial data for guiding follow up and surveillance of women with and without dense breasts. To ensure
equitable application of results, we will examine differences in results between Black and NHW women in all
aims. MDL models hold great promise as breast cancer risk assessment tools, and offer clinical efficiency and
optimization by eliminating the need to collect detailed family history and risk factor data. Validation in “real
world” epidemiologic cohorts will advance the field substantially. The research proposed here has great
potential to identify women at both high and low risk of breast cancer, inform personalized screening and risk
reduction strategies, and even to reduce racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes."
10899696,"New psychoactive substances (NPS) such as fentanyl analogs, synthetic cannabinoids, and synthetic
cathinones (“bath salts”) continue to emerge at an alarming rate. We know very little about prevalence of
exposure or about effects of these drugs as they emerge—largely because most people exposed are unaware
that they used (as these are common adulterants added to drugs like ecstasy and heroin). More advanced
toxicology methods are needed to detect exposures and most toxicology studies rely on biospecimens from
those who have been hospitalized. Epidemiological survey framework including toxicology methods can help
overcome the biases of relying on poisonings and quickly provide information on exposure and effects to those
recently exposed, and to scientists and the public. As such, we propose this R01 which examines trends in
reported drug use among a high-risk population—electronic dance music (EDM) party attendees. People who
attend EDM events (at nightclubs and festivals) are at high risk for use of drugs—particularly NPS, cocaine,
ecstasy (MDMA, Molly), LSD, methamphetamine, and opioids—and related adverse outcomes, including
death. Given that this high-risk scene may serve as a bellwether for trends that diffuse to the general
population, results will help prevent use, overdose, and death not only among EDM partygoers, but also in the
general population. Through projects conducted by this team of investigators conducted between 2016 and
2021, we have identified dramatic increases in drug use and unintentional exposure to NPS. In this R01, we
will continue to utilize our current R01’s recruitment methods and validated rapid drug survey (which queries
use of >100 drugs) to estimate trends in drug use, but we will focus more on our new and innovative
toxicological methods. Our toxicology methods will now use saliva testing to test for exposure to >1,000 drugs
(including over 120 fentanyl analogs). All participants will be asked their willingness to provide a saliva sample
and to take a follow-up survey to assess potential drug-related adverse effects during their night out. We will
recruit 4,160 adults entering EDM parties continuously over four years using time-space sampling. This study
will allow us to determine who was recently exposed to NPS (which most other labs cannot yet detect) and
determine whether factors such as honesty and attention on the survey predict testing positive after not
reporting use (based on our modified Impression Management theoretical model). We have confirmed the
feasibility of our methods and propose four aims. First, we will estimate the extent to which saliva testing adds
to prevalence of reported drug use. Second, we will determine effect profiles of exposure to new NPS as they
emerge. Third, we will determine if events such as DEA scheduling of NPS predict changes in trends of NPS
exposure. Fourth, we will determine if shifts in use and adverse effects are a bellwether for drug-related
outcomes. We will rapidly disseminate our findings regarding NPS exposure and NPS effects in this high-risk
population to prevent use and associated harms among EDM partygoers as well as the general public."
10909334,"DEVELOPING PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS WITH
SENSORY DISABILITIES
There are at least 16.2 million adults who identify as being deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH) and 12.8 million
who report significant vision difficulty (i.e., blind/vision impairment [B/VI]). People with sensory disabilities
(PWSDs) are a growing priority population due to significant health disparities, including poorer mental
health and physical health. Despite poorer health, PWSDs struggle with unmet medical needs, difficulties
accessing and navigating health care and challenges with managing their health. Health education and
promotion programs, including consumer health information resources, are often inaccessible and not
tailored for these individuals, exacerbating above inequities. In addition, accessible health resources, such
as ASL videos on “DeafHealth.org” and MedlinePlus, are no longer available. Prior research indicates that
PWSDs are at risk for inadequate health literacy, poorer access to information resources, and disparities
in advance care planning and diabetes prevention and management. Therefore, the primary objective of
this NLM G08 information resource proposal is to develop best practices in digital and non -digital patient
health education for PWSDs and demonstrate these best practices in use by developing materials on
advance care planning and diabetes prevention. This will be accomplished through three aims. (1) Assess
the information and accessibility needs of PWSDs to identify optimal user-centered design for patient
health education; (2) Develop patient health education assessment checklists centering the needs of
PWSDs; and (3) Demonstrate the utility of the checklists as guides in the development and curation of
accessible patient health education for PWSDs focused on advance care planning and diabetes . To guide
the above work, an Advisory Board of patients with sensory disabilities and librarians with or serving those
with sensory disabilities will be convened. Representatives on this Advisory Board will advise the project
team, provide expertise on centering the accessibility needs of people with sensory disabilities, and assist
with review of materials. This information will be used to generate a checklist and practice
recommendations for health educational programs and information resource developers in order to meet
the unique health educational needs of PWSD experiencing health disparities and comply with disability
based civil rights laws (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which covers federally funded
programs; the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and 2008 ADA Amendments Act; and Section
1557 and other provisions of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) that mandate

10723098,"Recent studies have shown a beneficial effect of cardiosphere-derived cell (CDC) therapy
on regeneration of injured myocardium following myocardial infarction (MI). While paracrine
signaling by CDC secreted exosomes (CDC-exo) is hypothesized to be the principal mediator of
improved function, the contribution of exosomes secreted from grafted cells and their mechanisms
of action have not been established.
 Our central hypothesis is that exosomes released by engrafted CDCs directly contribute
to cardioprotection. We have previously shown that human CDC-derived exosomes have a
primarily anti-apoptotic effect on cardiac myocytes and antiproliferative effect on cardiac
fibroblasts. Furthermore, we found that macrophages primed with CDC-exo are polarized towards
an anti-inflammatory phenotype with high expression of Arg1. Together, our studies support a
role for exosome secretion as a paracrine mechanism of stem cell-mediated cardiac repair in vivo.
Using a novel genetic lentiviral knockdown strategy to inhibit neutral sphingomyelinase 2
(nSMase2), a crucial enzyme in exosome secretion, we will test constitutive inhibition of CDC
exosome secretion in vivo, enabling us to achieve our long term goal of determining the functional
relevance and mechanism of cardiosphere-derived cell exosomes on the restoration of cardiac
function. Success in achieving the following specific aims is of high impact as there are few
pharmacological targets capable of influencing cardiac regeneration. To achieve these ends, we
shall address the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Determine the contribution of CDC-exo vs. CDC-secretome on infarct size in a
mouse model of acute MI.
Specific Aim 2: Define the role of CDC-exo on macrophage polarization and cardioprotection.
Specific Aim 3: Determine the role of exosomal miRNA on CDC-exo mediated cardiac repair.
 In summary, the goals of this work are to define the role of physiologically secreted CDC-
exo on cardiac function post MI, elucidate the contribution of CDC-exo-modulated macrophage
polarization on cardioprotection, and define the functional role of exosomal miRNA in CDC-exo
mediated effects. In doing so, we aim to identify novel therapeutic approaches to stimulate cardiac
muscle regeneration that do not require the administration of stem cell preparations and can
potentially enhance the care of patients with both heart failure and prior myocardial infarction."

 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent and impairing disorder. Behavioral
treatments that structure the environment and provide frequent and consistent monitoring are efficacious but
resource and time intensive, leading to problems with access and adherence. This study will utilize a virtual
reality platform to minimize distractions and provide the structure and monitoring necessary for individuals with
ADHD to maintain focus while completing homework and studying. The virtual reality (VR) headset will place
students in a distraction free environment that automates the frequent and consistent point-of-performance
feedback and reinforcement that serves as the core mechanisms of behavioral treatment. The VR technology
will allow for direct comparison between two novel intervention approaches and a VR passthrough to laptop
control. Survey and objective data (keyboard and mouse click data) will be collected to directly evaluate the
impact of VR on core targets of action, including concentration, motivation, and homework effort. This novel
alternative to medication and behavior therapy offers a completely new tool for supporting individuals with
ADHD. This study includes four separate projects, three in the R61 phase and a large randomized trial in the
R33 phase. Project 1 (N = 30 college students with ADHD) focuses on optimizing and refining objective data
capture algorithms to quantify on-task behavior and work productivity while completing a variety of different
types of academic tasks. Project 2 (N = 30 college students with ADHD) focuses on developing and refining
on-task monitoring and performance feedback algorithms within VR, including a green, yellow, and red-light
display that allows individuals with ADHD to receive consistent and frequent feedback and work towards
specific short-terms goals and rewards. Focus groups will also be completed to improve VR feasibility and
usability. Project 3 involves a small randomized controlled trial to ensure that the key targets of action are
engaged. Project 3 will assess the feasibility/usability and preliminary effects of the VR environment alone
(n=15) as compared to VR environment + contingency management (n=15) and a passthrough control wearing
of the VR headset (n=15). Time on-task, homework motivation, and homework effort are the proposed
mechanisms of action. If the Go/No-Go criteria are met in Project 3, the protocol moves to Project 4, which
involves a randomized trial of the VR intervention. 252 college students with ADHD will be randomized to
receive either: (1) VR environment alone, (2) VR environment + contingency management, or (3) pass-through
VR headset control for 8 weeks. Measures of mental health and academic functioning will be collected at
baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and at a 3-month follow-up."
10928795,"Project Summary or Abstract
The successful application of magnification devices for reading and daily tasks is predicated on their correct use
by individuals with low vision (LV). Barriers related to transportation, geography, and/or health-related concerns
often limit LV patients’ ability to attend several in-office training sessions as part of low vision rehabilitation (LVR)
to optimize visual function with magnification devices. A promising solution is real-time videoconferencing to
provide telerehabilitation, involving remotely delivered LVR services by a LVR provider in-office to a patient at
home. Telerehabilitation for LV appears to be feasible and acceptable by both patients and LVR providers, with
preliminary evidence that its efficacy for enhancing reading ability may be similar to in-office LVR. However, it
has not yet been fully demonstrated whether telerehabilitation is at least as effective as in-office usual care for
LV follow-ups. This would be critical information for LV providers for reassurance that either modality is
acceptable. Another key issue in LVR is the need for an effective system to continually assess how patients are
functioning at home. Ideally this would involve a non-invasive, efficient method to assess when magnifier device
abandonment occurs, so that a timely telerehabilitation session can be initiated. Bluetooth low energy (BLE)
beacon sensors attached to the handles of magnifiers can collect longitudinal data regarding environmental
changes, which might serve as a helpful indicator of magnifier use patterns by LV patients at home.
 Specifically, we propose to conduct a randomized non-inferiority trial of the potential for telerehabilitation to
enhance visual ability by providing remotely-delivered LVR training to use magnification devices and/or visual
assistive mobile apps in comparison to in-office usual care LVR. This will provide an evidence basis for whether
the effects of two interventions are not clinically and statistically different from each other. This is important to
determine if a novel service delivery mode (i.e., telerehabilitation), that might be safer, more resource efficient,
convenient, may improve adherence and/or access to care, is at least as effective as a more established
approach (i.e., in-office) with proven effectiveness. We aim to show how telehealth services can be made readily
accessible to those with LV, as well as the value of annual follow-ups via telerehabilitation. We will determine
whether BLE beacon sensor data are valid indicators of hand-held optical magnifier usage by LV patients at
home. We anticipate that beacon sensors attached to hand-held optical magnifiers will measure increased
temperature and/or humidity when motion is detected. Beacon sensor data will determine if it is feasible to
remotely assess when magnifiers are used or abandoned, and if their frequency of use changes following
telerehabilitation or in-office LVR.
 We envision that telerehabilitation can improve patient outcomes as an alternative, effective method for the
provision of follow-up LV services. This is a high priority given the increasing prevalence of LV, paucity of LV
providers, and barriers to care. Beacon sensors are a novel solution for monitoring LV patients beyond the clinical
office visit, which could enhance patient management with timely LV services and evaluation of LV device use."
10907809,"Project Summary/Abstract
In the last decade, significant efforts have been made to understand the development and complexity of
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), leading to the identification of recurrently mutated genes with well-defined
clinical, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. However, this has not been translated yet in effective
treatments. MDS can arise from a small population of disease-initiating cells that are not eliminated by
conventional therapies. An improved understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate these disease
initiating stem cells is paramount for the development of future curative therapies. Several factors converge to
induce evolution of malignant cells. Using 3 mouse models of MDS (the β-catenin-induced, the NUP98-HOXD13-
induced and the PU.1UREhetMsh2–/– -induced MDS models) and patient cells (MDS and paired MDS to
transformed AML) we have identified a transcriptional signature that is highly associated with MDS induction and
disease transformation. This signature comprises decreased expression of Nucleoporin (NUPs) family members
in AML as compared to MDS cells. NUPs expression is also downregulated in MDS cells as compared to healthy
HSCs in humans and inversely correlates with DNMT3A mutations, that are prominent in age-related clonal
hematopoiesis (ARCH), in AML cases transformed from previous MDS. In mouse and human iPSC models of
MDS, decreasing NUPs expression induces transformation of MDS cells to AML blasts. Our goal in this
application is to comprehensively examine the role of the NUP pathway in the induction of MDS from
aging related factors of clonal hematopoiesis and inflammation and in MDS stem cell dynamics and
identify the driving factors and mechanisms of their actions. To achieve this, we will define the mechanism
through which NUPs downregulation affects the growth of disease initiating stem cells in MDS;
determine the requirement of a decrease in NUPs expression for MDS initiation with aging and aging-
related factors of ARCH and inflammatory stress; and determine how NUPs promote clonal heterogeneity
by defining the genetic, molecular and transcriptional mechanisms of NUP-related MDS evolution with
aging. These studies will identify mechanisms and molecules that are significant contributors to MDS
pathogenesis and which may be therapeutically and preventatively targeted."
10934564,"Stereotypic repetitive behaviors, which are thought to be an obstacle to complex task execution,
including social behaviors and learning, are observed in mammalians and fish. Animals exposed to stress-
associated environment frequently exhibit repetitive behaviors. Chronic stress is known to change the
neurocircuit property and increase the blood glucose level. Accordingly, the low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet
reduced repetitive behaviors in disorder model animals. However, there is a significant knowledge gap
regarding how repetitive behaviors are particularly selected among other voluntary behaviors; is it based on
neurocircuit and/or metabolic changes? Whether natural genetic variations promote an increase or decrease
in repetitive behavior level is also poorly understood. Consequently, our central hypothesis is that, in an
experimental system relevant to typical heterogeneity, nutritional ketosis reduces repetitive behavior by
modifying the known dopaminergic and GABAergic signaling that choose the behavior modules (e.g.,
repetitive behavior, mating behavior, etc.). To provide the foundation to test this hypothesis, this project’s
main objective is to identify the gene coexpression regulatory network and its hub genes that reduce
repetitive behavior under ketosis. The Mexican teleost fish Astyanax mexicanus will be strategically chosen
as an experimental model, which consists of cave-dwelling (cavefish) and surface-dwelling fish (surface fish).
The cavefish display asocial behaviors and exhibit 1,839 of the shared directional gene expression changes
seen in human disorders related to repetitive behavior. This project’s rationale is that the genetic and
environmental impacts on repetitive behavior with the naturalistic heterogeneity are easy to study on our
animal platform, yielding the basic knowledge for neuronal and cellular responses to ketosis associated with
repetitive behavior. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it will use naturally
heterogeneous populations whose genetic and behavioral conditions are similar to patients with psychiatric
disorders. This project will also integrate omics data with the aid of an emerging clustering algorithm,
topological data analysis (TDA). TDA is robust for noisy and sparse datasets while retaining individual
variations that may be lost using typical dimension-reduction algorithms. This study is significant because it
promises to provide the first insights into the genetic basis of the nutritional plasticity of repetitive behavior,
which will foremost contribute to the future understanding of the neural and cellular responses governed by
nutritional interventions. Furthermore, the knowledge derived from this R01 project will be applied to the
murine system in the future to test if it is translational. The success of this test will support a conserved
pathway among heterogeneous populations in our fish, and between fish and mammals, opening the door to
human application of this knowledge."

Liver cancer is the second most frequent cause of cancer deaths. While cancer mortality has been declining
overall, liver cancer mortality has been rising steadily due to the increasing incidence of obesity and alcohol
abuse. This high mortality is mainly due to challenges in early detection. The goal of this project is to integrate
molecular, imaging, and clinical information for the early detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). In the
previous grant period, we developed a highly sensitive and cost-effective method of using cell-free DNA
methylome for cancer detection, and have successfully validated the technology on a pilot HCC versus cirrhosis
cohort. We have also established multiple clinical cohorts to study HCC detection, including a prospective
longitudinal HCC screening cohort of patients with cirrhosis or HBV. The availability of blood samples, imaging
scans, and comprehensive clinical information of patients in those cohorts provide us with unique opportunities
to develop an integrated cancer detection method in the next funding period. The UCLA center includes a
multidisciplinary team of clinical and translational researchers, and we have the following foci in the next funding
period: (1) Continued expansion of multiple clinical cohorts to facilitate early detection of liver cancer. These
cohorts shall provide an invaluable resource for the proposed research and other consortium-wide projects. (2)
Continued experimental and computational development to refine the cfDNA methylome assay for early cancer
detection. Experimentally, we will address a key challenge in cfDNA-based early cancer detection, namely, the
limited cfDNA input, and computationally we will extract additional features, in addition to DNA methylation, from
the assay data to enhance cancer detection. (3) We will integrate epigenomic, imaging, and clinical information
into a complementary approach for the detection of HCC. We will build etiology-specific models for the multi-
modality data to maximize performance. (4) We will contribute to collaborative consortium activities. We have
been enthusiastically participating in collaborations within and beyond the consortium. We are an active
enrollment site for the consortium-wide clinical cohorts, and we will collaborate with other centers to develop
multi-omics and multi-modality markers to exploit the diagnostic potential of blood samples and imaging data."
10847515,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pathologically strong or intrusive cocaine memories elicit uncontrollable drug craving and can trigger drug
relapse in cocaine-predictive environments even after protracted abstinence, yet the contributions of long-term
memory maintenance mechanisms to substance use disorders have been understudied. Cocaine memories are
not necessarily retained over time; they become destabilized upon retrieval (memory reactivation) and need to
be reconsolidated into long-term memory stores to be maintained, updated, and potentially strengthened. Thus,
interference with memory reconsolidation weakens cocaine memories in animal models of drug relapse and
reduces craving in individuals suffering from substance use disorders. The long-term goal of this proposal is to
advance our understanding of the neural basis of cocaine-memory reconsolidation so that cellular/molecular
processes and neural circuits suitable for effective therapeutic targeting can be identified in the future. We have
discovered that the CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus (dCA3) plays a critical role in the reconsolidation of
cocaine memories. Building on this finding and strong preliminary data, Specific Aim 1 will be to identify cellular
and synaptic-plasticity mechanisms of cocaine-memory reconsolidation within the dCA3. We will test the
hypothesis that reconsolidation requires glutamatergic pyramidal neuronal activity in the dCA3 stratum
pyramidale (SP) cell layer and GABAergic interneuronal activity in the dCA3 SP and stratum lucidum (SL) cell
layers. We will identify and phenotype engram cells in the SP and SL and, also, evaluate the hypothesis that the
maintenance of cocaine-memory strength via reconsolidation is associated with lasting plasticity in dentate gyrus
mossy fiber (MF)dCA3 engram cell synapses, but not in dCA3 non-engram cell synapses. Specific Aim 2 will
be to map dCA3 efferent circuits that regulate cocaine-memory strength during reconsolidation and determine
related synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Based on extant literature and strong preliminary data, we will test the
hypothesis that direct dCA3dCA1 intra-hippocampal and dCA3dorsolateral septum (dlS) extra-hippocampal
circuits regulate cocaine-memory strength in an opposite manner during reconsolidation. Further, we will
examine the hypothesis that cocaine-memory maintenance after reconsolidation is associated with increased
polysynaptic transmission (MFdCA3dCA1/dlS) and excitatory synaptic plasticity in dCA3dCA1/dlS
engram cell synapses. The proposed studies will utilize an instrumental model of drug-memory reconsolidation
and relapse, engram cell tagging using Targeted Recombination in Active Population protocols, cell type- and
pathway-specific in vivo and ex vivo optogenetics, pharmacology, multi-label immunohistochemistry, and whole
cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to increase our understanding of how hippocampal-memory reconsolidation
processes regulate cocaine memory strength and drug relapse. The findings are expected to provide an essential
conceptual framework for future research and insights for the development of effective treatments for substance-
use disorders and other psychiatric disorders characterized by intrusive maladaptive memories."
10909336,"The deep-brain imaging approach (microendoscopy) is a high throughput method that identifies
the temporal and spatial pattern of activity in specific phenotypes of neurons. We have hypothesized that
activity in small networks can identify normal versus diseased brains. To test this hypothesis, we will use
the two-wavelength miniscope to image activity of a subset of neurons in 5xFAD mice, a validated animal
model of Alzheimer’s disease (normal versus the homozygous littermates). We have created promoter-
driven calcium sensor that drives the red-shifted calcium indicator, jRGECO, into orexin-arousal
neurons. A separate calcium sensor (GCaMP6m) in GABA sleep neurons will be used as comparison.
The advantage of imaging neurons with two different wavelengths is that it allows for comparison of
arousal versus sleep neurons as the brain transitions between wake and sleep. We will image activity of
neurons that contain jRGECO and GCaMP during normal wake-sleep bouts and after 6h sleep loss. We
hypothesize that there is an abnormal temporal pattern of fluorescence during the transition from wake
to sleep in the brains of 5xFAD mice, and it worsens with progression of disease. This may explain the
cause of the disrupted sleep-wake patterns in Alzheimer’s disease. We hypothesize that abnormal activity
in deep brain circuits regulating sleep is a harbinger of disease. The overall impact of this small budget
project is that it will identify activity of two different juxtapositioned neurons during wake, NREM and
REM sleep in wildtype versus a disease model, which will aid in understanding how small clusters of
neurons behave as the waking brain falls asleep."
10726574,"We have identified an important and previously unknown role for PKM2 in HSC biology and liver
fibrosis. This work will give us a full mechanistic understanding of how PKM2 regulates hepatic stellate
(HSC) metabolism and activation, and test PKM2-binding new chemical entities for anti-fibrotic activity.
HSC are central to the development of liver fibrosis. There is extensive information on the many
transcriptional changes associated with HSC activation but how these changes are initiated and
regulated is still not well understood. From the work in the current Merit award we have identified a
novel role for pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in nuclear regulation of pro-glycolytic, pro-inflammatory and
pro-reactive oxygen species genes in liver macrophages (LM). HSC, upon activation, are faced with the
same organizational challenges as macrophages and other cells which transition from a quiescent to a
highly proliferative and anabolic state.
Hypothesis: Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) is a key regulator of liver fibrosis. Aim 1: Identify the
regulatory mechanisms of PKM2 mediated HSC activation. a) Identify the TGF-β1 induced post-
translational modifications (PTM) in PKM2 required for PKM2 nuclear translocation. Test the ability of
Erk 1/2 MAP kinases to phosphorylate key sites of PKM2 and use site specific Flag mutants of PKM2 to
identify which mutations result in loss of nuclear localization. b) Identify the nuclear mechanism of
PKM2 mediated transactivation of HSC activation and fibrotic response.
Aim 2: Identify the HSC intrinsic and extrinsic roles of PKM2 in liver fibrosis. a) Identify the HSC
intrinsic roles of PKM2 in liver fibrosis: Determine the role of PKM2 in regulating HSC metabolic
adaptation and downstream events. b) Identify the role of hepatocyte PKM2 in liver fibrosis: Determine
the role of hepatocyte PKM2 in the production by hepatocytes of TGF-β1 and other cytokines that
regulate the TGF-β1 pathway.
Aim 3: Test the in vivo efficacy of novel PKM2 inhbitors for anti-fibrotic activity. We will test the ability of
TEPP-45, and additional novel PKM2 binders, in preventing and reversing liver fibrosis.
The current work will give us a full mechanistic understanding of how PKM2 in different liver cell
populations regulates HSC activation, and liver fibrosis."

Aging is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and yet mechanisms as to
how aging impacts this disease remains vastly underexplored. Aging is associated with non-resolving
inflammation (inflammaging). The resolution of inflammation requires the balance between pro-
inflammatory leukotrienes (LTs, e.g. LTB4) or prostaglandins (PGs) and w3-derived specialized pro-
resolving mediators (SPMs), like resolvins. While it is now known that atherosclerosis is associated with
a reduced SPM:LT or PG mediator ratio, major gaps exist in our understanding of (a) the mechanisms
regulating impaired resolution in age-related atherosclerosis and (b) how SPMs promote resolution. Our
objective is to investigate mechanisms of defective resolution in aging so that we can develop novel
strategies to treat atherosclerosis in the physiological context of aging. We found a new links in which
aged atherosclerotic mice had impaired resolution of atherosclerosis, exhibited exuberant granulopoiesis
and defective SPM signaling in the bone marrow. We propose three highly integrated, but independent,
Aims to address mechanisms regulating myelopoiesis in aging and atherosclerosis and to determine the
efficacy and mechanisms of resolvin therapies in aging and atherosclerosis. These Aims will address a
fundamental gap in our understanding of the physiologically relevant context of aging in atherosclerosis.
Completion of the proposed studies will provide mechanistic insight into dysregulated resolution
processes in aging, define cells, mediators and mechanisms restraining plaque resolution/regression in
aging, and establish rationales for new therapies.

10889212,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gaining a better understanding of the population genomic processes that shape observed genetic variation is
at the heart of evolutionary biology. Over the past decades, much previous genomics work has focused on
studying the causes and consequences of point mutations, utilizing single nucleotide variation to infer rates
and patterns of recombination, population demographic history (modulating genetic drift), and natural selection.
However, by failing to incorporate structural variants (insertions, deletions, duplications, translocations, and
inversions with a length of ≥ 50 bp), the greatest source of heritable variation was often neglected, contributing
to the 'missing heritability' problem faced in many studies of complex phenotypes. Owing to their size,
structural variants frequently disrupt protein-coding genes and/or modify gene expression, thus their
characterization is crucially important to elucidate factors related to health and disease. Several population-
specific structural variant catalogues have recently started to emerge for human populations; yet, similar
datasets remain limited for most non-human primates, despite their importance to evolutionary research (as
outgroups to the human lineage) and extensive usage in biomedical and behavioral research. This neglect is
largely owing to historical reasons, as short-read sequencing and limited sampling previously made a
comprehensive quantification of genome-wide structural variation impossible. However, cutting-edge single-
molecule long-read sequencing technologies now allow us to investigate the topic with considerable resolution.
Over the next five years, the Pfeifer lab will combine the development of novel long-read genomics datasets
with computational methods for evolutionary inference to: (i) comprehensively characterize the full spectrum of
genomic variation (including the relative frequencies of different types of structural variants) in three
biomedically-relevant primate species, (ii) conduct genomic-wide comparisons with hominoids to gain a better
understanding of the diversity within and divergence between species, (iii) characterize the molecular and
evolutionary processes determining the accrual, and dictating the fate, of structural variants, (iv) determine
associations with previously characterized clinical phenotypes, as well as (v) investigate the interplay of
(structural) mutation with another population genetic process that shapes genome structure, recombination.
Taken together, this research will improve the utility of these species as models in biomedical research,
provide new insights into the etiology of disease, and allow for a deeper understanding of the mode and tempo
of evolutionary changes across the primate clade."
10894308,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Emergent behaviors arise when individuals follow rules about how to interact with one another and their
environment to produce a group entity with new properties or abilities1,2. Common examples include a school
of fish, a flock of birds, and a colony of ants. In an emergent behavior, individuals often simultaneously
communicate with multiple other individuals while processing sensory cues from the environment2,3. All this
information is integrated to produce a behavioral response that is remarkably cohesive across the group.
Though complex information integration is a hallmark of how humans process the world, the mechanisms
underlying communication in groups have been difficult to probe experimentally. I have discovered the first
example of emergent group behavior in C. elegans in which individuals coordinate motion without being in
physical contact: in response to a simple environmental cue, a population of several hundred individuals will
synchronously perform an inward bidirectional spiral that eventually concentrates the initially dispersed
population at a central point. The behavior occurs when a lid is placed on an open dish containing a sufficient
density of worms in the absence of food and is dependent on intact sensory systems. Furthermore, I have
demonstrated that a cue from a high density population can be sensed across a shared airspace to induce
spiral-like behavior in individual worms that would not otherwise show spiral motion. I therefore propose that C.
elegans uses a volatile cue to gauge population density, and spiraling behavior is triggered by concentration of
this cue when the dish is closed. However, I also demonstrate that accumulation of a cue is not sufficient to
induce spiraling if inter-worm distance is too great indicating that local cues between neighboring worms are
also involved in coordinating spiraling. In Aim 1, I will elucidate the cues that individuals produce and perceive
to facilitate emergent spiraling in C. elegans including both long-range density cues and short-range cues from
nearby individuals. In Aim 2, I will take advantage of the tractability of C. elegans to ask how brain activity
produces emergent spiraling behavior. C. elegans are transparent, and the brain activity of individuals can be
directly visualized by following calcium transients in freely moving worms4. I will explore the hypothesis that
neural networks reduce the noise of inputs to produce maximally coherent behavior across individuals in the
collective. Together these findings will illuminate principles underlying emergent behavior at unprecedented
resolution which may allow us to identify similar processes occurring in other systems or design artificial
systems which exhibit spiral behavior."
10913614,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Several forms of renal replacement therapy (RRT) exist to help patients with ESKD, but they are not equally
desirable, with in-home dialysis and kidney transplantation being generally preferable to in-center hemodialysis.
The best evidence available indicates that, compared to in-center dialysis, pre-emptive kidney transplantation
and at-home dialysis modalities are associated with better quality of life, same or better survival, and are more
cost-effective. Noting these benefits, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services launched the
Advancing American Kidney Health initiative in 2019. This program proposed a target of having 80% of ESKD
patients on home dialysis or receiving a preemptive transplant by 2025. Yet, according to the U.S. Renal Data
System, only 14% of patients diagnosed with ESKD in 2018 utilized a home dialysis modality or received
preemptive transplant, despite the fact that the majority of patients are both medically and psychosocially eligible
for these options.
In part, this may be due to the work that RRT requires of patients to implement new healthcare “workload” into
their lives. In the case of home dialysis, patients must shoulder these new tasks without the help of healthcare
professionals traditionally found at in-center dialysis facilities. In the case of transplant, patients are often
surprised by the lack of a return to “normal life” due challenges with immunosuppression, finances, and
relationships that follow transplant. When treatment workload exceeds patient capacity, defined as patients’
abilities and resources to access and use healthcare services and enact self-care at home, patients are at risk
for poorer outcomes. These outcomes are in part driven by unsustainable treatment burden, defined as the
objective treatment work asked of patients and the subjective negative social and emotional consequences.
Treatment burden is correlated with patient non-adherence and has been found to affect as many as 40% of all
patients with chronic conditions. There is considerable evidence that patient capacity is a modifiable construct
and relevant to CKD care. It is created through patient interaction with their biography (sense of self and life
roles), resources, environment, experience of patient work, and social network.
In the proposed study we will determine if patient capacity, among CKD patients who progress to kidney failure,
correlates with the choice of RRT (Aim 1). We will also determine amongst ESKD patients on RRT whether
higher capacity predicts the switch to a more desirable form of RRT and lower capacity predicts the switch to a
less desirable form of RRT or withdrawing from RRT (Aim 2). Finally, this study will determine amongst
CKD/ESKD patients medically eligible for transplant if patient capacity is prognostic for transplant referral,
transplant approval, or death on the transplant wait list (Aim 3)."
10914283,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an ultrasound-based cardiac imaging procedure frequently used
to facilitate informed surgical decision making and manage intraoperative complications during the quarter
million cardiac surgeries performed in the US each year. And yet, there is no randomized evidence to support
the use of intraoperative TEE in any type of cardiac surgery. This lack of randomized evidence is particularly
problematic in isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery because observational comparative
effectiveness studies are conflicted regarding the association between improved postoperative outcomes with
(vs without) intraoperative TEE. Complicating matters, TEE is an invasive procedure where its unconfirmed
clinical benefits may not outweigh its confirmed risks of gastroesophageal injury. The questions surrounding
the unclear clinical efficacy, unknown real-world effectiveness, and undefined risk-benefit ratio of intraoperative
TEE during isolated CABG surgery is a critical evidence gap with clinical equipoise that has resulted in
widespread practice pattern variability and a near 50/50 split in TEE (vs no TEE) intraoperatively. Thus, the
overall objectives of this K23 research will leverage this existing clinical equipoise and practice pattern
variability to generate the required foundational data necessary to inform a future, multicenter, randomized
controlled trial (RCT) that could resolve the questions surrounding the clinical efficacy, effectiveness, and risk-
benefit ratio of intraoperative TEE use (vs lack of use) during isolated CABG surgery. To that end, three aims
will test the central hypothesis that among a routine isolated CABG surgery population (i.e. a population
suitable for randomization given the absence of valve disease), the treatment effects of intraoperative TEE on
postoperative clinical outcomes after isolated CABG surgery will vary among subgroups (aim 1) and that
randomizing routine isolated CABG surgery patients to either default (i.e. obligatory) or as-needed (i.e. backup)
intraoperative TEE will garner adequate participation by stakeholders (aim 2), and demonstrate enough
practical feasibility in a single-center, pilot RCT conducted at the Candidate’s institution (aim 3), to accomplish
on a larger scale in a future, multicenter RCT. The information gained from completion of these three aims will
provide the preliminary data required to inform subsequent, multicenter clinical trial(s) comparing perioperative
clinical outcomes among routine isolated CABG surgery patients randomized to default vs as-needed
intraoperative TEE. In combination with a structured course of mentoring, and a research training plan heavily
focused on the how to plan, design, and conduct randomized clinical trials, this K23 will be the foundation for
the Candidate’s progression toward becoming a leading clinical trialist and comparative effectiveness
researcher dedicated to improving clinical outcomes in the cardiac surgical patient population."
10730547,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of KS and primary effusion
lymphoma (PEL), and is tightly linked with multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). These tumors occur most
commonly in immunocompromised individuals, especially those with AIDS. There are no specific therapies for
these malignancies. KS is the leading AIDS malignancy, and is epidemic in sub Saharan Africa. KS commonly
involves the oral cavity and can disseminate to visceral organs. Saliva is the vehicle of transmission for KSHV.
 Latency is the hallmark of KSHV and gammaherpesvirus infection. KSHV latently infects cells, including
tumor cells, and viral genomes persist as extrachromosomal, circularized, multi-copy, episomes. To persist in
proliferating cells, viral episomes must replicate, and following mitosis, segregate to daughter cell nuclei.
Tumor cell viability is dependent on latent KSHV infection.
 The latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is one of several viral genes expressed in latency.
LANA mediates KSHV episome maintenance, and is necessary and sufficient for episome persistence in the
absence of other viral genes. In addition to episome persistence, LANA exerts important roles in transcriptional
regulation.
 Epigenetic histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) tri-methylation (H3K4me3) marks are associated with actively
transcribed genes and are deposited by histone methyltransferase (HMT) complexes. There are six HMTs
(MLL1-4, Set1A/B) in mammals responsible for catalyzing methylation of histone H3 at K4 through a SET
domain. LANA is highly enriched at H3K4me3 peaks at both viral and host chromatin, yet the mechanism of
LANA recruitment to and its function at these sites remains unclear.
 We have discovered novel LANA interactions with HMT components and that LANA regulates specific
HMT activity. Further, we find this HMT activity is critical for virus latency establishment. This work will use
rigorous, detailed, in depth approaches to investigate the mechanistic basis of these findings. Experiments will
investigate the role of the HMT activity in LANA mediated episome persistence. We will investigate the role of
the LANA-HMT interaction in LANA and HMT chromatin targeting of virus and host, and its effects on
H3K4me3 deposition and gene expression. Experiments will also investigate the mechanism of LANA’s
regulation of HMT activity and its role in virus latency. LANA and HMT activity are critical for latency, and this
work therefore provides novel and important insight into a fundamental component of KSHV biology."
10739569,"Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are disabling and prevalent conditions that affect almost one-third of Americans.
While initial treatments exist, relapse is common, making long-term recovery difficult. Given the high rates of
relapse, interventions that seek to prevent relapse have high potential impact. Animal models have shown that
the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is heavily implicated in alcohol dependence, alcohol withdrawal,
and withdrawal-induced alcohol seeking. Neuroadaptive changes in response to chronic alcohol exposure
modify BNST function through multiple processes. During abstinence, these changes in the BNST are
associated with heightened negative affect and potentially relapse through negative reinforcement. While
animal models of addiction are heavily studied under the assumption of their utility in translation to humans, a
major unmet need in the field is to translate these animal models to humans. A major barrier to this work has
been technological limitations in neuroimaging of the BNST because of its small size. We have recently
overcome this challenge. We have characterized the BNST neural circuitry in humans and developed novel
methods to test BNST function. Our team also conducted an NIAAA funded R21 pilot study of BNST function
and connectivity during abstinence in humans with an AUD. We confirmed alterations in a BNST network in
early abstinence. However, one of the most striking findings was that there is substantial heterogeneity in
anxiety and depression symptoms; critically, variation in symptoms was correlated with BNST function and
connectivity. Data from a large residential treatment sample further points to several subgroups, or
phenotypes, of how negative affect changes across the first 30 days of abstinence. Together, these findings
highlight that early abstinence is not homogenous and that important individual differences exist. The goal of
this project is use precision neuroscience methods to establish BNST circuits associated with negative affect
during early abstinence and to forward-translate findings from rodent model lab studies. The Vanderbilt Alcohol
Research & Education Center will provide the infrastructure needed to perform forward-translational and
reverse-translational studies. The current study will investigate three specific aims: (1) Identify and characterize
negative affect phenotypes during early abstinence; (2) Test the hypothesis that alterations in BNST network
function and connectivity are associated with individual differences in negative affect; (3) Forward Translation:
Test novel anatomical pathways identified by Projects 2-4. The successful completion of this study, in close
collaboration with the Research Core and other Research Components, will fill a critical knowledge gap in
identifying the neurobiological basis of individual differences in negative affect during abstinence and will
cross-validate the pathways identified in Projects 2-4. The results will provide foundational information to
inform future studies investigating mechanisms of negative affect in abstinence and can guide the development
of personalized treatments for AUD."
10739571,"ABSTRACT
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by high levels of alcohol intake followed by aversive
negative affective states when individuals cease consumption. In certain individuals suffering from
AUD, alcohol taking and seeking is, in many cases, thought to be motivated by negative
reinforcement, where individuals continue consuming alcohol to avoid these negative internal states
that are triggered by abstinence. While a large body of work has outlined the precise brain regions,
cellular populations, and neural circuits that underlie these affective states and their effects on
behavior in rodents and humans, to our knowledge, studies have not explicitly focused on the circuits
controlling negative reinforcement itself – the action of avoiding aversive stimuli. Recent work from
our group has shown that there are robust sex differences in negative reinforcement behavior at
baseline. Moving forward, it will be critical to understand if there are sex differences in the circuits that
control negative reinforcement and if alcohol-induced alterations in these circuits interact with
biological sex to alter AUD. We focus on the role of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc) as our preliminary data show that manipulations of D1 receptor containing MSNs in
the NAc causally mediate negative reinforcement. Additionally, previous work has shown that this
cellular population can alter drinking and alcohol seeking and undergoes robust plasticity following
alcohol consumption. Thus, D1 MSNs causally mediate negative reinforcement, are altered by
alcohol consumption, and are capable of triggering alcohol seeking. We hypothesize that binge
alcohol exposure enhances negative reinforcement by altering medium spiny neurons in the
NAc on the circuit and molecular level, and that basal sex differences interact with alcohol-
induced alterations in these systems. Using operant tasks where animals emit operant responses
to avoid negative outcomes, we will 1. Use in vivo microendoscopy to outline the cell-type specific
neural activity signatures that underlie negative reinforcement in males and females 2. Determine
how these signatures are changed by alcohol exposure and abstinence in males and females and 3.
Determine molecular effectors within these populations in both sexes using cell-type specific
transcriptional profiling. Together, the Vanderbilt Alcohol Research and Education Center (VAREC)
allows for an integration of research aimed at collaboratively answering how AUD-associated
phenotypes emerge using precision neuroscience approaches."

Sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations are disproportionately impacted by mental health concerns
relative to their heterosexual and cisgender peers. SGM populations, however, continue to report unmet mental
health needs because they cannot or do not access mental health services. Digital Mental Health (DMH) has
been recognized as a feasible, economical, and effective approach to broaden the availability of mental health
care to consumers who face barriers to mental health help-seeking. SGM consumers cite a preference for DMH
resources, and this delivery format holds promise to attend to major access barriers experienced by this
consumer group. Yet, the availability of DMH content tailored to the needs of SGM consumers is limited, and a
dearth of research examines SGM populations' actual engagement with DMH services. A potential solution to
fully understand how SGM populations utilize DMH services would be to characterize their engagement within a
natural setting. Leveraging an established partnership with Mental Health America (MHA), a non-profit mental
health advocacy group offering free, evidence-based screenings and self-guided DMH resources, this study will
follow a large, naturalistic sample of SGM DMH consumers with the aims to: 1) characterize consumers' current
and predictive patterns of engagement with MHA's DMH resources and examine consumer characteristics
associated with these different engagement patterns (Aim 1); 2) employ human-centered design approaches to
gain insights related to group-specific processes not captured by MHA's meta-data that impact DMH
engagement among SGM consumers and integrate data to design and build prototype engagement strategies
for consumer evaluation (Aim 2), and; 3) test the tailored engagement strategies with MHA's SGM consumers
using a micro-randomized trial (MRT) design (Aim 3). To accomplish these aims and prepare for a larger R01
trial, the Principal Investigator will receive training in: 1) the theoretical, substantive, and methodological
underpinnings of DMH; 2) big data management and analytic methods, specifically supervised machine learning;
3) human-centered design approaches for designing tailored DMH interventions, and; 4) experimental design
and data analysis for evaluating adaptive DMH interventions. The candidate is an Assistant Professor of Social
Work at the University of Washington whose long-term career goal is to become an expert in the field of mental
health services research, specializing in digital interventions to improve service access for SGM consumers
through increased availability and enhanced acceptability. The proposed study advances this objective by
aligning with the care preferences of SGM consumers, leveraging the infrastructure of an existing DMH platform
at minimal burden to consumers, and contributing evidence towards optimized engagement outcomes for SGM
consumers through the use of tailored strategies."

Childhood obesity is a modifiable determinant of many adulthood chronic diseases, including heart disease and most types of cancer, Children from families with socioeconomic disadvantage suffer from increased risk of childhood obesity and related chronic conditions, experiencing 23-33% greater obesity prevalence when compared to children in higher-income households. Community coalitions, consisting of members from organizations that represent multiple sectors (e.g., public health, schools, community-based organizations), have proven their ability to reduce childhood obesity by using evidence-based strategies (EBS). However. coalition adoption of EBS remains a well-cited challenge. particularly within communities with higher levels of poverty. Because coalitions are networks of partnerships, researchers have started using network interventions with coalition leaders to jointly modify coalition partnerships to accelerate behavior change and increase the diffusion of obesity prevention knowledge. Further, researchers are using systems science simulation to provide insight into the mechanisms through which individuals' relationships change over time and how individual behavior spreads. Thus, with the help of simulation, this study aims to develop and test network interventions to increase the adoption of evidence-based strategies (EBS) among childhood obesity prevention coalitions serving communities with socioeconomic disadvantage. This will be accomplished first by collaboratively developing network interventions using simulation with coalition leaders and modeling experts, and second, by using a 2- arm cluster-randomized control trial to test the feasibility of deploying the network interventions aimed at increasing the adoption of EBS among coalitions working in populations with socioeconomic disadvantage. This grant will generate crucial training for Dr. Moore's advancement to become an independent investigator in chronic disease prevention, focusing on the effects of community coalition action on child health equity, The training goals for this application are to acquire: (1) theoretical knowledge and practical skills in network science and simulation; (2) knowledge and skills in implementation science research and health disparities research; and (3) skills in the design and analysis of small-n experimental designs. Dr. Moore has a supportive institutional environment and a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise in obesity prevention, network science and modeling, implementation science, health disparities, and community-based research. This career development award will advance Dr. Moore through the NIH research pipeline, preparing him for a successful R01 grant application, helping him achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent scientific researcher with expertise in developing and testing interventions aimed at enabling coalitions to improve their evidence translation and health equity practices."

Learning is a complex process, and likely involves many areas of the brain that detect and process sensory
inputs, integrate experience, and display behavior. Consistently, various neurological diseases that impair
different brain areas are associated with profound defects in learning. Thus, bridging different spatial scales
and understanding the dynamics of different brain regions are essential to understanding how learning occurs
and potentially designing strategies to mitigate learning deficiency. However, it is currently not possible to
achieve these goals in most experimental systems, and our understanding of learning is limited by the
technical approaches by which either local circuit and cellular properties or coarse psychophysical
parameters underlying learning are measured. Here, we propose to address these fundamental questions in
a reduced system – the nervous system of the nematode C. elegans. The rationale is that the wiring and
genetic make-up of this network are well known, probing whole-brain dynamics with single-cell resolution
with exquisite temporal resolution is technically ready for C. elegans, and the fundamental principles for the
development and the function of the nervous system are well conserved between C. elegans and more
complex animal models. Further, C. elegans exhibits many forms of learning, similar to those displayed by
higher organisms in behavioral characteristics and molecular cellular underpinnings. Particularly, we will use
an olfactory learning paradigm whereby C. elegans learns to avoid the odorants of pathogenic bacteria, a
type of learning similar to the Garcia effect through which many animals, including humans, learn to avoid
the smell and/or taste of a food that makes them ill. Our long-term goal is to understand how learning is
encoded and executed by the function of the whole brain, and to inform the design of potential therapeutic
strategies. The central hypothesis of this project is that learning engages global activity and the learned
information is encoded in distinct functional modules. Specifically, we will test whether learned information
is encoded in the learning-dependent changes in the activity patterns of individual functional modules and/or
the interactions among the modules. To this end, we aim to image and analyze multi-cell and whole-brain
dynamics under naive and learned conditions to characterize how learning alters the structure of the brain
activities; further, we will introduce perturbations to the whole-brain dynamics and examine the consequences
for learning. This work is innovative because (1) it brings a conceptual advance to understanding learning
across scales, (2) it introduces technical advancement in whole-brain imaging and analyses, and (3) it
demonstrates perturbation strategies for altering whole-brain dynamics that have behavioral consequences.
It is significant, because it tests several highly plausible and likely conserved cellular and whole-brain
dynamic models for learning and examine their behavioral consequences, it informs and facilitates learning
studies in other systems, and it paves the way for designing interventions."

Sporadic loss-of-function mutations, recurrent missense mutations, and copy number variants (CNVs) contribute
significantly to the etiology of autism, but much of the genetic architecture has not yet been understood. Most
known pathogenic CNVs are large and the significance of many of these gene mutations is still not known. The
goal of this proposal is to significantly increase the yield of high-impact autism mutations by focusing on the
discovery of understudied classes of rare variants from whole-genome (n = 35,000 samples) and whole-exome
(n = 150,000 samples) sequence data being generated from autism families. This proposal focuses on ultra-
rare, gene-disruptive mutations and leverages the additional sensitivity afforded by whole-genome shotgun
sequencing data, novel CNV discovery methods, and transmission of ultra-rare inherited mutations to increase
yield of pathogenic mutations. Our target will include the discovery and validation of smaller and more complex
structural variants (including CNVs) and private gene-disruptive mutations not enriched in de novo mutation but
preferentially transmitted to autism children. We will assess the utility of high-fidelity long-read sequencing to
discover more complex forms of structural variation that have been missed by standard short-read sequencing
by investigating 100 unsolved cases with a higher likelihood of genetic risk. In addition, we propose to select 10
genes with evidence of de novo mutation for further clinical evaluation, phenotypic variability, and comprehensive
genetic characterization. This will include five genes where only de novo mutations have been observed
compared to five genes where both de novo and inherited mutations have been documented in order to
understand carrier phenotypes. This proposal specifically focuses on the application of novel genomic methods,
recurrent mutations, and inheritance patterns to discover pathogenic variants in order to develop a more
sophisticated model to explain the genetic architecture of autism. As part of this effort, we will quantify and
compare the risk of different classes of mutation for autism and investigate transmission disequilibrium
differences. The end product of this analysis will be the identification and characterization of new classes of
highly penetrant genic mutations that contribute significantly to etiology of autism, providing targets for clinical
diagnostics and future therapeutics."

disproportionate burden of health disparities related to substance use and HIV. The goal of this study is to
elucidate and address disparities experienced by UREMP in substance use patterns, substance use treatment
outcomes and HIV-related outcomes including the contribution of social, cultural, structural, and other factors.
We focus on underserved racial/ethnic populations as well as other marginalized groups such as those who
are transgender, have unstable housing, or were recently incarcerated. We will 1. Determine
methamphetamine, cocaine and opioid-related behaviors, risk factors, and treatment outcomes to better
understand health disparities among UREMP and better tailor future intervention/treatment and prevention
approaches. We will examine differences in drug-related behaviors including types, frequency, severity of use,
mode of administration, polydrug use, overdoses, Naloxone access, and substance use treatment access and
outcomes. We will determine the role of demographic, behavioral, psychosocial and clinical factors, and
incorporate additional structural/social measures such as of racial/ethnic identity, stigma/discrimination, and
other domains based on recommendations from community partners, end-users, and critical thought partners
to determine risk factors for differences in drug use patterns and substance use treatment outcomes. 2.
Determine the role of methamphetamine, cocaine and opioid use in HIV-related outcome disparities among
UREMP. We will examine longitudinal relationships between drug use, social, cultural, and structural factors,
and HIV care cascade steps such as engagement in care, viral suppression and health-related quality of life.
We will determine the impact of drug use and social, structural, and other factors on age-related comorbidities,
such as diabetes, frailty, myocardial infarction and chronic kidney disease among UREMP. We leverage the
large well-characterized racially/ethnically, gender, and sexual orientation-diverse cohort of PWH with
comprehensive clinical data in the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS)
cohort. The CNICS patient reported outcomes assessment captures detailed drug use patterns, psychosocial,
behavioral and other factors such as social support and racial stigma/discrimination and facilitates capturing
multiple dimensions of identity. CNICS geocoding and carefully adjudicated outcomes facilitates including
structural factors and evaluation of HIV-related comorbidities. CNICS data and our team bring a breadth and
depth of resources, responding to RFA-DA-23-061 by generating new knowledge about substance use-related
disparities among PWH from UREMP and the impact of social, structural, and cultural factors. This study will
inform future research and assist end-users within our community partnerships in tailoring future substance
use treatment programs to the unique needs associated with people’s multidimensional identities in order to
reduce disparities among populations affected by inequities at the intersection of HIV care and substance use."

Falls result in substantial morbidity, mortality, and disability among older adults. Recently, hearing loss and
hearing handicap have been identified as independent risk factors for falls. It is unclear the factors that mediate
the association between hearing loss and falls. The long-term goal is to to develop novel interventions that will
modify falls risk in the hearing impaired patient population. The current objective is to identify and understand
the auditory and vestibular related factors that explain the association between falls and hearing loss and to
characterize performance on these candidate factors. To that end, our proposal aims to examine the vestibular-
related factors, centrally mediated auditory factors (spatial hearing and listening effort), cognitive, and
psychosocial factors in an older adult patient population of fallers and non-fallers. The current proposal is
innovative as the work will characterize the extent to which key theoretical factors explain the link between falls
and hearing loss and specifically the extent to which unrecognized vestibular dysfunction may explain the
association. These contributions will be significant, as they will inform strategies to implement targeted
rehabilitation programs to reduce falls and falls-risk in this patient population."

The goal of this project is to introduce a new synthetic strategy to functionalize pyridine and diazine heterocycles.
Pyridines are the second most common nitrogen heterocycle found in FDA approved drugs, and there are
numerous examples of diazines in these structures. The widespread occurrence arises because of a combined
effect of the heterocycle and its substituents. The key drug-receptor interaction is often comprised of a hydrogen
bond between the heterocycles N-lone pairs and the biological target. These heterocycles are also polar, can
engage in p-stacking interactions and are resistant to oxidative metabolism. The substituents enable tuning of
the steric and electronic environment of the heterocycle as well as serving as additional binding sites. As such,
medicinal chemists require chemical process that can directly and selectively install a range of substituents at
various stages of drug discovery from C–H precursors. In this proposal we will develop three different approaches
for azine functionalization. First, we will install heterocyclic phosphonium salts and exploit their unique reactivity
to develop coupling reactions with amines, thiophenols, cysteine containing molecules and alkynes. Using
phosphines with pendant functional groups will enable coupling with water and ammonia. Second, direct coupling
reactions between NTf-pyridinium salts and nucleophiles will be exploited for C–Heteroatom bond formation.
additionsThis platform will enable direct coupling with aliphatic amines, anilines, amides and sulfonamides.
Third, we will use sulfur nucleophile to change the regioselectivity of nucleophilic addition from the 4-position of
pyridines to the 2-position of the scaffold. Once embedded in the substrate, these sulfur nucleophiles also serve
as versatile functional group the enable other transformations to make C–N, C–O and C–F bonds."

The exposome is defined as the totality of exposures with which the public comes in contact, including
toxic chemicals. Exposures to these chemicals represents a huge burden on human health and diseases.
It is difficult to perform comprehensive safety assessment of all novel chemicals due to limited time and
funds. However, with the vast amount of biological data related to thousands of exposures and their
molecular targets, we hypothesize computational methods can be developed to accurately predict the
molecular actions and targets of new chemicals. In this proposal, we propose to implement and apply a
novel matrix completion algorithm named Coupled Matrix/Tensor-Matrix Completion (CM/TMC)
and Coupled Matrix/Tensor-Tensor Completion (CM/TTC) to predict the molecular targets and
target tissues of environmental chemical exposures at a large scale. The study proposed will be
accomplished through the following specific aims: 1) Apply and optimize the CM/TMC algorithm for
exposure-related datasets, comparing results to alternative methods, 2) Optimize the CM/TMC method for
exposure target tissue prediction, and 3) develop CM/TTC method on exposure-target predictions,
perform experimental validations, and establish a web portal for exposure-target prediction. This study
poses the first matrix completion-based method on exposure molecular target predictions and target
tissue predictions. The primary goal of the mentored (K99) phase of the award is to provide the candidate
with additional training in data science and toxicology for him to acquire scientific independence and
successfully accomplish his career objectives. The K99 phase will be conducted at the University of
Michigan (UM), under the mentorship of Drs. Maureen Sartor, Justin Colacino, Kayvan Najarian, and
Mario Medvedovic, who are experts in the respective fields. An interdisciplinary team of advisors will
assist the candidate in his research and career development. After the completion of the K99 phase, the
candidate will be well prepared to be an independent investigator."

 The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods, theory and
computational tools for statistical modeling of large-scale multiple high-dimensional genomic data motivated by im-
portant biological questions and experiments. New high-throughput technologies and next generation sequencing are
generating various types of very high-dimensional genetics, genomic, epigenomics, metabolomics data in order to
obtain an integrative understanding of various complex phenotypes. Integrative analysis of genomic data from differ-
ent populations and tissues can potentially increase the power of detecting disease associated genetic variants and
genes, and provide the possibility of making causal inference in genomic studies, eventually leading to understanding
of the disease causal pathways and genomics-based risk prediction. The speciﬁc aims of the current project are to
develop new statistical models and methods for polygenic risk score (PRS) prediction and for integrative analysis of
eQTL and genome wide genetic association (GWAS) data for identiﬁcation of possible causal genes and pathways
of complex diseases. In order to effectively utilize data across different ethnicity groups and different tissues, this
project will develop several novel transfer learning methods in order to achieve better estimate of polygenic risk scores
and to increase the power of detecting trait associated variants in minority populations. The project will also develop
method of meta-learning to predict ethnicity- and tissue-speciﬁc gene expressions in order to increase the power of
transcriptome-wide association analysis (TWAS). Finally, statistical methods for genome-wide co-localization analysis
that can effectively integrate GTEx data with GWAS association summary statistics will be developed in order to identify
possible causal disease genes and pathways. These methods hinge on novel integration of methods for multiple re-
lated high-dimensional regressions, high-dimensional Gaussian sequence models and subspace estimation. The new
methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally help facilitate the identiﬁcation of genes as
well as the biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and genomics-based disease risk predic-
tion. The work proposed here will contribute statistical methodology and theory for transfer learning and meta-learning
in high-dimensional genomic data to study complex phenotypes and to offer insights into each of the biological areas
represented by the various data sets, including Alzheimer's disease, cardiometabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney
disease. All algorithms, software tools and the resulting polygenic risk score models and tissue-speciﬁc gene expres-
sion prediction models together with detailed documentation will be made available on the GitHub."
10861870,"All (+) RNA viruses modify cytoplasmic membranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to establish replication compartments (RCs). These RCs are thought to form a platform for membrane- associated replicases, in addition to protecting the viral RNAs from cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors that trigger innate immune signaling and RNA-degradation machinery. We and others have shown that a key component in the viral mechanism of RC formation is the modulation of RC membrane lipid composition. We previously published that at least 3 (+) RNA virus families (Bromoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Flaviviridae) share the property of stimulating phosphatidyl choline (PC) accumulation at RCs. This suggests that understanding viral modulation of PC synthesis may have broad implication as a conserved mechanism in RC formation. We have extended this observation to gain significant mechanistic insight into this process. The specific aims are: Aim 1. Define the contribution of PC synthesis for viral replication. We hypothesize the activation of PC synthesis aids the formation of viral RCs and may also impact virion infectivity via altered ER lipid composition. Aim 2. Define the mechanism by which HCV modulates PC synthesis. Aim 3. Define the significance of the ASCL enzymes in HCV replication. ASCLs localize to RCs and are required for HCV replication. We hypothesize that a viral protein recruits them to RCs and that they are required to provide the long chain fatty acids for phospholipids, such as PI and PC."

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for understanding outcome-driven behavior and its neural
basis. A key issue for RL is how to incorporate an ability to make inferences that allow appropriate responding
to novel conditions not encountered during training. Inference relies on the detection of latent relationships that
predict rewards but are not signaled by explicit cues. In the previous funding period, we developed behavioral
and computational approaches to rigorously address this problem, and made single-cell neurophysiological
observations that began to reveal how the brain represents latent structures. Here, we re-conceptualize this
problem as one of using a cognitive map to represent latent order and support inference. We propose to test
this idea with a newly developed behavioral approach, which allows unprecedented insight into the role of
cortico-striatal neural circuits and ascending neuromodulatory systems in model-based RL. These
investigations will focus on brain regions that neurophysiology, neuroimaging, and lesion studies suggest have
important roles in implicit serial learning, specifically dorsolateral (dlPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex
(vmPFC), and dorsal striatum. Three aims will 1. Test NHPs ability to make model-based inferences in the
presence of countervailing reward incentives, 2. Identify neural circuitry of serial learning in the dlPFC, vmPFC,
and caudate nucleus, and 3. Test if changes in Ach and DA concentrations are correlated with serial learning,
particularly during transfer. Inferential reasoning is impaired in many psychiatric illnesses including
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This impairment may underlie thought disorders such as delusions and
paranoia."

Environmental cues and signals are fundamental in the regulation of behavioral decision making. For decades
this aspect of social behavior has been a major focus of environmental psychology and neuropsychiatry
research. Yet the complexity of the mammalian nervous system and the lack of experimental traction in humans
has limited a mechanistic understanding of how environmental influences shape sensory processing and social
behavior. The goal of this proposal is to take advantage of the comparatively simple nervous system of
Drosophila to identify the functional neural basis of environmental control over social behaviors, which has the
potential to inform our understanding of devastating neuropsychiatric conditions characterized by the failure to
appropriately process social and other environmental cues. In my experimental approach I leverage the power
of striking natural variation in the environmental control over mating behaviors across species in a comparative
framework and combine it with the unparalleled neurogenetic toolkit of Drosophila to isolate causal neural circuit
mechanisms through which environmental cues control behavior.
In the mentored phase of this award, I will elucidate the functional integration of food odors with male courtship
circuits (Aim 1) and characterize how visual cues emitted by the social group regulate female copulation
decisions (Aim 2) using a combination of in vivo functional brain imaging in a multimodal virtual reality system,
optogenetics, and neuroanatomy approaches across two species with divergent behaviors. The comparison of
alternative circuit architectures underlying behavioral differences will allow me to isolate the circuit motifs and
dynamics that control the functional integration of these environmental cues with central mating circuits. For the
independent phase of the award, I will transfer the skills and techniques acquired during the training phase to
develop a new model for comparative neuroscience. This will allow me to elucidate the neuronal functional
principles underlying bacterial manipulations of the nervous system that alter the perception of environmental
signals and manipulate mating behavior of infected individuals in the bacteria’s favor (Aim 3).
The proposed professional development plan under the continued mentorship of Dr. Vanessa Ruta complements
my training in evolutionary biology, chemical ecology and systems neuroscience with the background and
techniques necessary to complete the proposed research and shed new light on the functional mechanisms of
environmental control over social behavior. To achieve these goals, I will take advantage of the extensive
resources of the Rockefeller University and my advisory committee, that will provide expert guidance in key
aspects of the project and career development. Together this will set me up optimally to successfully transition
to an independent position and start my own lab exploring the mechanisms underlying the sensory control of
behavior at the intersection of neuroscience and evolutionary biology."

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a pervasive disorder affecting up to one-fifth of adults globally and is the
single greatest cause of disability worldwide. Despite the high prevalence and detrimental impact of CLBP, its
treatments and mechanisms remain largely unclear. Biomarkers that predict symptom progression in CLBP
support precision-based treatments and ultimately aid in reducing suffering. Longitudinal brain-based resting-
state neuroimaging of patients with CLBP has revealed neural networks that predict pain chronification and its
symptom progression. Although early findings suggest that measurements of brain networks can lead to the
development of prognostic biomarkers, the predictive ability of these models is strongest for short-term follow-
up. Measurements of different neural systems may provide additional benefits with better predictive power.
Emotional and cognitive dysfunction is common in CLBP, occurring at the behavioral and cerebral level,
presenting a unique opportunity to detect prognostic brain-based biomarkers. Likewise, improvements in
electroencephalogram (EEG) neuroimaging strategies have led to increased spatial resolution, enabling
researchers to overcome the limitations of classically used neuroimaging modalities (e.g., magnetic resonance
imaging [MRI] and functional MRI), such as high cost and limited accessibility. Using longitudinal EEG, this
patient-oriented research project will provide a comprehensive neural picture of emotional, cognitive, and
resting-state networks in patients with CLBP, which will aid in predicting symptom progression in CLBP.
Through this mentored career development award (K23), I will use modern EEG source analysis strategies to
track biomarkers at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-ups and their covariance with markers for pain and
emotional and cognitive dysfunction. In Aim 1, I will identify and characterize differences in resting-state,
emotional, and cognitive networks between patients with CLPB and age/sex-matched controls. In Aim 2, I will
identify within-subject changes across time and their relationship with clinical symptoms. In Aim 3, as an
exploratory aim, I will apply machine- and deep-learning strategies to detect a comprehensive signature of
CLBP using EEG features from resting-state, emotional, and cognitive networks. Throughout the award period,
I will develop new and advanced skills in understanding CLBP and its comorbidities as well as in EEG signal-
processing strategies, machine-/deep-learning algorithms, career development, and grant writing. To
accomplish the proposed study and training, I have gathered a world-class team of experts in pain imaging,
physiology, psychology, EEG, and statistical learning as mentors. This training will build on my prior
experience in psychophysiology to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an R01-funded investigator focused
on patient-oriented research in chronic pain and psychophysiology."
10726620,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The prevalence of cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease has doubled, whereas the prevalence of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has increased 10-fold in the veteran population. Worldwide, HCC has
emerged as a major cause of cancer-related death. There is an urgent need to further understand HCC
pathogenesis and discover new biomarkers that could accurately predict HCC development in patients with
chronic liver diseases, so that we can provide better and more effective strategies for HCC prevention and/or
treatment in veteran population. Bile acids (BAs) are well known to be cytotoxic due to their detergent-like
properties and overt BAs promote HCC development. In humans, increased levels of secondary BAs,
especially deoxycholic acid, is associated with the development of HCC in veteran patients with cirrhosis. BA
homeostasis is tightly regulated by farnexoid X receptor (FXR). FXR expression and function are reduced in
patients with HCC, and FXR knockout (KO) mice develop spontaneous HCC. FXR suppresses BA levels
mainly by fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15; FGF19 in humans) mediated gut liver crosstalk and by promoting
BA enterohepatic circulation. FGF15/19 emerges to be critical endocrine hormones to suppress BA synthesis,
promote liver regeneration and regulate energy homeostasis. Long-term overexpression of FGF15 in vivo
(Fgf15 transgenic-Tg mice) results in reduced growth hormone (GH) signaling in the liver and GH signaling is
involved in cell proliferation and HCC formation. In this proposal, we will determine the mechanisms by which
long-term FGF15 overexpression protects the liver from HCC development in FXR KO mice. Using a novel
mouse model we generated, Fgf15 Tg mice, and the newly generated FXR KO/Fgf15 Tg mice, we provided
preliminary data showing that FGF15 overexpression completely protected FXR KO mice from developing
spontaneous HCC. In addition, overexpression of FGF15 led to a marked reduction in BA levels and GH
signaling. Based on these compelling preliminary data, we generate a novel hypothesis: overexpression of
FGF15 prevents HCC development through two interactive mechanisms: suppression of BA levels and
reduction of GH signaling to reduce cell injury and cell proliferation. This novel hypothesis will be tested in two
independent but related specific aims. Aim 1. Determine to what extent reduction of BAs is the mechanism for
suppressing HCC development in cholestasis mouse models. Aim 2. Determine the extent of GH signal
blockage, and to what extent the reduced GH signal in the Fgf15 Tg mice prevents HCC development. This
proposal is highly innovative because we will provide a profound understanding of the molecular mechanisms
by which endocrine FGF15 collectively suppresses BA levels and GH signaling, which can markedly prevent
HCC development during cholestasis. It is also very technically innovative due to the unique and novel animal
models we have generated for in vivo studies. Furthermore, we will provide profound understanding of the
mechanisms of BA homeostasis, liver growth and HCC development. This study will be highly human relevant
because humans and rodents share similar BA pathways in liver disease development. We believe that this
study will help to provide scientific basis for prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of human HCC
development in cirrhotic veteran patients in the future."
10931490,"The Translational Research Center (TRC) includes a diverse team of clinical and translational researchers with
a strong track record of working together to reduce hepatocellular cancer (HCC). The TRC uses data from a
unique group of patients with cirrhosis who are being recruited from eight different sites throughout Texas (the
TRC cohort). Our TRC cohort currently includes > 3700 patients with cirrhosis (>10,000 follow up surveillance
visits and >190 HCC cases) who have diverse risk factors, including cured HCV and non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease. These patients are under routine HCC surveillance and their biological samples and clinical and
radiological data for each visit is stored; it is a valuable resource for our research and other Consortium projects.
We also launched a separate prospective cohort of patients with indeterminate liver nodules, which is a high risk
and high priority group for HCC risk stratification and early detection. We are collecting surveys, clinical data,
images and biospecimens from this cohort. The catalytic effects of our TRC are seen in the productivity of our
junior investigators, who started innovative new initiatives and programs. Our work had a broad impact, including
helping develop various society guidelines on HCC surveillance. Using data and the strong network of
investigators and institutions collaborating with our TRC, we have already generated important data on risk
factors and risk stratification for HCC. We also developed and demonstrated the framework for adding patient-
and liver disease-related factors to new blood-biomarker profiles to improve early HCC detection. Here, we
propose to build a novel imaging repository, including MRI images from our cohort. We will annotate and
incorporate data from abdominal ultrasound reports for our TRC cohort using novel, scalable machine learning
pipelines. We will also strengthen our data by appending information from the State cancer registries. Using data
from different sources available to us, we will develop and test new personalized methods to stratify risk that
blends information from clinical factors, blood-based biomarkers, and imaging (radiomics) to predict future
development of HCC in patients with cirrhosis across diverse risk factors (Aim 1). We showed that the HCC
Early Detection Screening (HES) algorithm, when combined with HCC blood-based biomarkers (AFP‐L3, DCP)
in HES version 2.0 (HES v2.0), substantially improved early detection. We will validate and compare HES v2.0
with GALAD, another early detection algorithm, and evaluate their performance versus the current standard
ultrasound-based surveillance (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will develop a new mathematical model to look at how
useful current and emerging biomarkers are for detecting HCC. We will also assess the risks, costs, and benefits
of HCC surveillance using different cutoffs of existing and novel blood and imaging biomarkers. We will develop
and disseminate an online Simulator so that other investigators can evaluate the potential clinical utility of HCC
early detection biomarkers as potential surveillance tools. Our translational approach will have both an immediate
and long-lasting impact on HCC-related morbidity and mortality."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a clinically complex, heterogeneous condition affecting 1 in 44 children in the
U.S. The identification of common etiologies across multiple forms of genetic and idiopathic forms of ASD will
critically advance diagnostic biomarker discovery and therapeutic development. Dysregulation of cellular
translation has emerged as a pathophysiological mechanism common to at least a subset of ASD forms.
However, systematic investigation of the cellular mechanisms that converge onto the ASD phenotype has been
hampered by a paucity of robust and reproducible human ASD cellular models and scalable experimental tools
for cell-type resolved characterization at the level of translation. To address these bottlenecks and to directly
address the role of translational dysregulation as a common feature in ASD, we have (1) used advanced genome
engineering tools to generate an extensively validated, isogenic series of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)
lines modeling 15 syndromic forms of ASD caused by highly penetrant gene and genome variants, representing
~10% of the total ASD population (the largest such panel created to date, to our knowledge), (2) established a
robust human iPSCs-derived cortical organoid model of brain development, and (3) developed ribo-STAMP, a
method for translational profiling of individual cells in heterogeneous cell populations, which is the first and only
method enabling translation to be measured at single- cell resolution. In this project, we identify common and
divergent pathological mechanisms in genome- engineered isogenic stem cell based organoid models of ASD,
using single-cell transcriptomic and translatomic approaches. We validate our findings using cellular and
functional phenotypic assays and in patient-derived iPSC models. If successful, our study will identify common
and unique translation-aware single-cell resolved gene expression signatures that predict cellular and functional
outcomes. We anticipate that our datasets and insights into cell-type specific deficits in gene expression of
genetic forms of autism will critically accelerate the development of a unified framework that enables molecular
categorization of both genetic and idiopathic cases, facilitating the identification of biomarkers and the
development of targeted therapies."

We will optimize acquisitions to reduce the impact of OOV echoes for each challenging region and develop
modeling strategies to minimize their impact on metabolite quantification. We will also develop intelligent
acquisitions that can detect OOV signals in real-time as the sequence is being acquired and adjust the
acquisition responsively to reduce OOV signals. Finally, we will continue the on-going work to disseminate

Alcohol use disorder is a complex group of disorders involving excessive uncontrolled alcohol intake. Our
recent human imaging data suggest distinct circuits of interest in male and female AUD subjects during

affective disturbances that emerge during abstinence are associated with the relative strength of this pathway.
We will further assess the therapeutic potential of the endocannabinoid system at this synapse by utilizing a
novel genetic strategy of deletion of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor and the endocannabinoid 2-AG synthetic
enzyme DAG lipase in patterns to determine its specific contribution to AUD-related behaviors at the insula-
BNST synapse. In male mice, we will explore the disruption of the ventral hippocampal-BNST-hypothalamic
circuit suggested by human imaging data in a model of operant alcohol seeking behavior. Finally, we will
perform novel tracing strategies to determine afferent inputs to these pathways to inform future human imaging
studies."
10739294,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The plasma membrane (PM) is a bustling hub of transport, signaling and structural functions that sustain life at
the cellular level. Failure to appropriately choreograph these parallel functions contributes to the pathogenesis
of many diseases. Selective regulation of PM function relies on the cytosolic leaflet phosphoinositide (PPIn) lipid,
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]. PI(4,5)P2 is a master regulator, recruiting and/or activating
scores of proteins controlling PM permeability, vesicular traffic, cytoskeletal assembly and receptor-driven
signaling. Human diseases from cancer to rare monogenic disorders are known to be associated with aberrant
PI(4,5)P2 levels, which result from disrupted PI(4,5)P2 synthesis or breakdown. That said, the sheer number of
PI(4,5)P2-regulated functions has made it challenging to identify which functions contribute to disease
phenotype, let alone attempt therapeutic intervention. Therefore, the long-term goal of the lab's research is to
develop a detailed, mechanistic understanding of how PPIn metabolism couples to individual physiological
processes; ultimately, we aim to use this knowledge to develop strategies that modulate or restore PI(4,5)P2
regulation of individual functions that are aberrant in disease. Our goal in this application is to define three
distinct mechanisms by which metabolism of PM PI(4,5)P2 or its signaling products couple to multiple
physiological processes. In the first project, we leverage our recent discovery of a PM PI(4,5)P2 homeostatic
mechanism to experimentally tune the lipid level in cells: this will allow us for the first time to determine the
PI(4,5)P2 concentration-dependence of key PM functions. This will reveal which functions are most affected by
pathogenic PI(4,5)P2 levels and thus likely drive disease phenotypes – a crucial first step in devising therapeutic
interventions. In the second project, we will identify lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) that couple PPIn removal from
membranes to their degradation by PPIn phosphatases located in other organelles. We will employ a synthetic
biology approach in which LTPs deplete ectopic mitochondrial PPIn in live cells. Identifying LTPs coupled to
different PPIn pools will reveal new targets to prevent PPIn accumulation in monogenic disease where
phosphatase activity is lost. In the third project, we will define the distinct PI3K signaling landscapes driven by
the two downstream lipid products of PI(4,5)P2: PIP3 and PI(3,4)P2. We will define the unique spatiotemporal and
effector protein activation profiles of these lipids in live cells, using our unique molecular tools to precisely detect
and chemogenetically manipulate the lipids in cell culture. Crucially, this will identify spatiotemporal and effector
protein activation profiles that are unique to each lipid. This knowledge will be vital to eliminate on-target adverse
effects of proven PI3K therapeutics. Collectively, at the conclusion of this funding cycle we expect to have defined
fundamental principles by which specificity emerges from the coupling of PM PI(4,5)P2 signaling to individual PM
functions in cells. This will be significant, because it will provide the conceptual framework for experimental and
eventually therapeutic intervention in these isolated processes at the point of PI(4,5)P2 regulation."
10739295,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Food insecurity, the lack of consistent access to enough food for an active and healthy life, is an important
social determinant of health that affects over 40 million Americans. Food insecurity is associated with an
increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Because of the prevalence and potential
for poor health outcomes, national and state organizations recommend that health systems address food
insecurity in order to improve patient care and reduce health disparities. Few clinicians assess patient’s food
security in practice, though, and the pathways by which food insecurity leads to disparities in cardiovascular
disease remain unclear. The research goals of this study are to advance our knowledge of the relationship
between food insecurity and cardiovascular disease and test an innovative tablet-based application for primary
care practices to address food insecurity in order to improve cardiovascular health. To accomplish these goals,
the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodical training
with an innovative research agenda. Aim 1 will use national survey data to determine the pathways through
which food insecurity is associated with cardiovascular disease using structural equation modeling. Aim 2 will
engage patients, clinicians, clinic staff, and key community leaders in a highly iterative process of user-
centered design to modify and tailor a tablet-based application for primary care practices to address the
pathways identified in Aim 1. Aim 3 will determine the feasibility and potential impact of the tablet-based app in
a pilot, pragmatic trial in one primary care practice. To successfully accomplish these Specific Aims, the PI will
capitalize on the outstanding research environment at Wake Forest School of Medicine and an engaged
interdisciplinary mentorship team (Drs. Rosenthal, Bertoni, Ip, Miller and Vitolins) of exceptionally qualified
senior scientists. With guidance from his expert mentor team and through didactic coursework and hands-on
experience, the PI will obtain the necessary training in structural equation modeling, cardiovascular
epidemiology, clinical informatics, and pragmatic clinical trials to become an independent investigator and
leader in reducing disparities in cardiovascular disease by addressing the social determinants of health. This
proposed K23 award complements National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes’ strategic focus on investigating
factors that account for differences in health among populations and optimizing clinical and implementation
research to improve health and reduce disease. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career
Development Award will advance our understanding of the chronic health effects of food insecurity and will be
a timely catalyst for the PI in achieving his long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator focused
on improving the health of low-income and vulnerable populations."
10739302,"Vascular hyperpermeability is well-recognized to be responsible for sepsis-triggered organ failure and patient
mortality. Despite decades of intensive study, there is no specific treatment available for targeting such vascular
leakage thus far. This is due in part to the incomplete knowledge of the mediators and mechanisms underlying
sepsis-elicited disruption of the endothelial barrier integrity. At present, most prior work has focused on
pulmonary vascular leakage that results in lung edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Few studies have
investigated coronary vascular leakage, which is a major cause of heart failure and death in human patients with
septic shock. We recently discovered that expression of lipocalin 10 (Lcn10), a poorly characterized member of the
lipocalin superfamily, was significantly downregulated in the hearts of both endotoxin LPS- and cecal ligation-
puncture (CLP)-treated mice, compared to their controls. Interestingly, further cell-type specific analysis showed
that such reduction of Lcn10 did not occur in either cardiomyocytes or fibroblasts but only in cardiac endothelial
cells (ECs). These compelling data implicate a potential role of Lcn10 in sepsis-induced cardiovascular leakage.
Indeed, using a global knockout mouse model, we observed that deficiency of Lcn10 significantly augmented LPS-
induced vascular leakage, leading to greater cardiac depression and higher mortality, compared to LPS-treated
wild-type control mice. By contrast, in vitro forced overexpression of Lcn10 in ECs showed greater resistance to
LPS-induced monolayer leak relative to control cells. An initial mechanistic analysis by RNA-sequencing and RT-
qPCR showed that both endogenous and exogenous elevation of Lcn10 in ECs caused significant upregulation of
slingshot homolog 1 (Ssh1). Ssh1 is a phosphatase known to dephosphorylate and thus activate Cofilin, a key
actin-binding protein that plays an essential role in controlling actin filament dynamics. Most importantly,
knockdown of Ssh1 in ECs offsets the Lcn10-induced reduction of monolayer leakage upon LPS exposure. Based
on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that Lcn10 is critical for protecting against sepsis-induced vascular leak
via the activation of the Ssh1-Cofilin pathway. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1)
Define the precise role of Lcn10 in vascular permeability during polymicrobial sepsis, using a global
knockout and an EC-specific Lcn10-transgenic mouse model; 2) Identify the mechanism by which Lcn10-
elicited reduction of cardiovascular leakage is dependent on Ssh1-mediated actin dynamics, using a cross
mouse model by mating EC-specific Lcn10-transgenic mice with Ssh1-KO mice; and 3) Investigate the
therapeutic potential of recombinant Lcn10 protein in treating sepsis. The proposed studies are expected to
identify Lcn10 as a potent and novel regulator of vascular permeability and a new protector against sepsis-induced
heart failure. If completed, the findings from this proposal are likely to provide new therapeutic options for reducing
vascular leakage during sepsis, with the hope of improving the survival of septic patients."

The central thesis of the Vanderbilt AUD Research and Education Center (VAREC) is that effective treatment
requires recognition of, and deep understanding of the diverse symptoms, etiologies, and disease progressions
that underlie what is unitarily referred to as Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). We propose a reverse translational
“precision neuroscience” approach. We will dissect AUD endophenotypes to generate human circuit construct
validated animal models that we will utilize to gain mechanistic insights and test therapeutic targets. VAREC
will consist of 4 research components (Projects1-4) supported by Administrative and Research cores, as well
as a Dissemination core. Project 1 (Blackford) expands our initial human imaging studies into a deep sampling
approach to analyze BNST and network connectivity in AUD across the abstinence timespan, exploring
individual differences in these networks with AUD relevant domains such as anxiety and depression. Project 2
(Winder) will build off an already active collaboration with Project 1 to perform reverse translational mouse
studies to test emergent hypotheses on insula-BNST and hippocampal-BNST connectivity in mouse models of
AUD, and to explore potential time-dependent therapeutic approaches during abstinence. Project 2 will also
perform specific broad-scale mouse brain imaging studies to define network nodes for Project 1 to explore in
years 4-5. Project 3 (Calipari) will explore whether alterations in negative affect observed in Project 1 and
Project 2 lead directly to functional enhancement of negative reinforcement-oriented circuitries and behavior.
Finally, Project 4 (Siciliano) will engage in deep phenotyping of individual differences in mouse behaviors
correlated with compulsive drinking behavior, working across the projects to identify populations of precise
behaviors that are predictive of compulsive ethanol seeking. Projects 2 and 4 explore therapeutic targets
through analysis of endocannabinoid and dynorphin signaling. The project interactions will be coordinated by
an Administrative core. A Research core will provide mice that have undergone one of two voluntary alcohol
exposure models, Chronic Drinking-Forced Abstinence (CDFA) or Structured Tracking of Alcohol
Reinforcement (STAR). It will also provide research infrastructure and computational support. Through a
Dissemination core, VAREC will play an important role in public health by activities aimed at destigmatizing
AUD treatment seeking and increasing prevention through novel near-peer targeting of adolescents. This core
will also allow VAREC to serve as a resource to the alcohol research community to facilitate mainstream
incorporation of cutting-edge tools into the field."
10740450,"PROJECT SUMMARY
MAIN 4
Early initiation of alcohol use during adolescence and subsequent binge drinking put young individuals at high
risk for developing alcohol use disorder (AUD), with young girls more likely to escalate alcohol consumption over
boys. Similar to these human studies, our current work in the DEARC demonstrated enhanced sensitivity of
female rats to ethanol withdrawal-related negative affective-like behavioral alterations during early adolescence
relative to males. Both sexes were equally affected by withdrawal from chronic exposure when tested in late
adolescence. The central amygdala (CeA) is primarily composed of a GABAergic cell population that is sensitive
to acute and chronic ethanol and is highly implicated in withdrawal-associated anxiety. The CeA is also
responsive to input from sexually dimorphic oxytocin and vasopressin neuropeptide systems. The current
proposal will address critical gaps in our understanding of sex differences in sensitivity to ethanol withdrawal
during adolescence. Aim 1 will assess withdrawal effects during early or late adolescence, focusing on sex
differences in CeA function, connectivity and CeA GABAergic cell activity in adolescent rats. Aim 2 will similarly
investigate CeA function, connectivity and CeA GABAergic cell activity in both sexes during withdrawal from
chronic ethanol exposure. Finally, Aim 3 will test whether vasopressin and/or oxytocin neuropeptide systems
sex-dependently contribute to withdrawal-related negative affect and CeA dysfunction in adolescents."
11182897,"As a result of the US Supreme Court's June 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization,
the landscape of reproductive health care in the United States is in the midst of seismic and rapid change.
Within 100 days of the ruling, fourteen states either banned or severely restricted abortion provision; over the
coming months, many more are likely to follow suit. The abrupt changes in access to abortion in the US are
without precedent in terms of the number of individuals who are affected and the number of states in which
there remains substantial uncertainty around enactment of further restrictions in the near future. This project
addresses the urgent need for baseline data to capture the impact of state abortion restrictions expected over
the coming months on the health of pregnant people, as well as the need for high quality estimates of abortion
incidence both within and outside of the formal health care system. Without these data, primary public health
indicators for the nation will not be available, nor will policy makers, program developers, service providers,
researchers and the public have the research-based evidence needed to understand the impact of these
abortion policies now and going forward.
To address this critical need, we propose four linked aims. Starting in the first month of the R61 phase (Aim 1),
we will begin data collection activities to measure change in abortion within and outside the formal health
sector during a period of anticipated rapid state-level policy change. In Aim 1a, we will collect data on abortions
occurring within the formal health sector using a new and adaptive monthly abortion surveillance system,
surveying representative samples of health facilities providing abortion care. We will produce public facing
monthly estimates of facility-based abortion incidence nationally, leveraging decades of historical facility-level
abortion data in a Bayesian hierarchical model to improve precision. In Aim 1b, we will collect data on
abortions occurring outside of the formal health care sector, measuring abortion-related complications and the
healthcare needs of people self-managing abortions (SMA) by surveying SMA users and providers.
Data collected in Aim 1 will be used in the R33 phase to measure the impact of state policy change and inform
estimation of abortion incidence outside the formal health care sector. In Aim 2, we will assess the impact of
state abortion restrictions implemented during project year 1 on the number of people obtaining facility-based
abortions and the gestational age of their pregnancies, and the incidence of interstate travel to obtain facility-
based abortion care. In Aim 3, we will adapt a methodology used extensively outside of the US to estimate
abortion under restrictive conditions to estimate self-managed abortion incidence outside of the formal health
sector. Finally, in Aim 4, we will combine data on facility-based and self-managed abortions to estimate the
national incidence of abortion and abortion-related health outcomes."
10894243,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infertility is estimated to affect ~15% of all couples worldwide and male factors account for 40% of infertility
among couples. Only ~10% of U.S. reproductive age women get pregnant each year and only ~60% are
intended pregnancies. Despite the increasing use of medical treatment among couples with decreased
fecundity, success rates of live birth have remained stable. Thus, identifying modifiable factors, such as
environmental exposures, that can impact human fertility is a major clinical and public health matter. Intake of
fruits and vegetables in the U.S. general population is the primary source of exposure to non-persistent
pesticides, which has been associated with different adverse health effects, including infertility, reproductive
disorders, and pregnancy and perinatal complications. While it has been shown that paternal environmental
exposures may impact the sperm epigenome and consequently offspring health, no epidemiological studies to
date have explored pregnancy and perinatal effects of paternal pesticide exposure and potential biological
mechanisms that explain the associations. To address these important knowledge gaps, we aim to determine
the association of male urinary concentrations of pesticide biomarkers (individually and as a mixture) with
semen parameters, sperm DNA methylation and mitochondrial DNA biomarkers (aim 1), with pregnancy and
perinatal outcomes adjusting for female urinary pesticide biomarkers (aim 2), and also with epigenetic aging in
semen and leukocytes. Epigenetic age or DNA methylation aging biomarkers have recently emerged as
excellent biomarkers of age-related diseases such as infertility and reproductive health. To examine these
novel aims, we will leverage two prospective cohorts of couples attending fertility centers: the Environment and
Reproductive Health (EARTH) Study in Boston, MA (main study), and the Sperm Environmental Epigenetics
and Development Study (SEEDS) in Springfield, MA (validation study). The proposed study will increase our
understanding of non-occupational pesticide exposure for a relatively understudied area of male reproductive
health and will also open an important area of inquiry into better understanding of how paternal environmental
exposures can impact couples’ and offspring’s health and potential biologic mechanisms linking the paternal
environment to his children’s health. Most importantly, this project addresses strategic priorities of the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) for advancing environmental health sciences, including
assessing coexposures and individual susceptibility to environmental chemicals. We are currently collecting
detailed health measures on children who were born to couples who participated in the EARTH Study to
determine the extent to which paternal and maternal preconception environmental exposures are associated
with neurodevelopmental and metabolic endpoints. Incorporating the assessment of exposure to several
classes of pesticides will provide data that can be linked in future studies on children’s health outcomes."

E-TREAT: Evaluation of Telemedicine for diabetes and hypertension care in Latinos
Latinos are more likely to have diabetes and hypertension and to face poor outcomes and complications from
these diseases. Quality primary care can reduce poor outcomes from these diseases, but primary care
services changed drastically in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic shifted many primary
care visits from face-to-face visits to telemedicine (telephone and video) visits. It is uncertain how frequently
Latino patients with diabetes and hypertension utilized (and continue to utilize) these types of visits, and how
this may have affected the services they received for diabetes and hypertension, and how well their diseases
were controlled. It is also unknown how various social factors (community economic resources, language
barriers, access to broadband internet) might moderate the association of telemedicine on diabetes and
hypertension care and control. This study will assess the use of telemedicine (video and telephone visits) vs. in
person visits between Latino and non-Hispanic white patients with diabetes and/or hypertension seen at
community health centers in the United States over the course of and subsequent to the COVID-19 pandemic.
It will also assess the association of telemedicine utilization with the receipt of recommended diabetes and
hypertension care services, and assess the potential of social determinants of health to moderate the
effectiveness of telemedicine in mitigating disparities in diabetes and hypertension care between Latino
populations and non-Hispanic white populations in these patients. Understanding the quality of diabetes and
hypertension care delivered via telemedicine among Latinos with diabetes and hypertension and which social
determinants of health moderate its effectiveness is critical for healthcare planning and policies around
reimbursement and regulations and will have a significant impact on patients, clinicians, policy-makers, and
healthcare system leaders and allow for equitable healthcare delivery."
10933485,"The role of T cells in RA is established, but nearly all research has focused on CD4 T cells. We have
shown that CD8 T cells are similarly expanded and activated in inflamed RA synovium yet do not belong to the
typical granzyme (Gzm) B+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) subset. Instead, they express high levels of GzmK
whose function is not well defined. Remarkably, we find that GzmK drives a new pathway of complement
activation. We show that GzmK can cleave C4 and C2 into C4b and C2a to generate an active C3 convertase
(C4b2a) that cleaves C3 to C3a and C3b. We show that fibroblasts express the highest levels of complement
components C2, C3 and C4 in the synovium and can secrete these proteins in response to CD8 T cell-derived
TNF and IFNg. We show that GzmK can elicit formation of an active C3 covertase by cleaving complement
components secreted by fibroblasts. Further, we demonstrate that GzmK generated C3a and C3b are bioactive
and can drive mast cell degranulation and opsonize cells, respectively. We hypothesize that GzmK-mediated
complement activation by GzmK in vivo occurs on cell surfaces as we show GzmK binds strongly to plasma
membranes. Recently published research by others shows that complement activation drives inflammatory
priming of murine synovial fibroblasts, mediated by mTOR activation with downstream metabolic changes and
production of pro-inflammatory molecules. We propose to determine if human CD8 T cell-derived GzmK can
induce inflammatory priming of human synovial fibroblasts by mediating local cellular complement activation
and whether GzmK can drive complement activation and inflammatory arthritis in murine models.
 In Aim 1, we study GzmK binding to cell surfaces and determine its ability to assemble a C5
convertase, resulting in the generation of the anaphylatoxin C5a and a C5b-9 membrane attack complex. In
Aim 2, we define the ability of GzmK to induce inflammatory priming of synovial fibroblasts via complement
activation, by determining the effects of 1) recombinant and live CD8 T cell-derived GzmK on the inflammatory
and metabolic activation of synovial fibroblasts. Then, using CRISPR GzmK-deleted T cells or CRISPR
complement factor or complement receptor deleted fibroblasts, we confirm if these effects are mediated
directly by GzmK and complement. In Aim 3, we use GzmK globally deficient mice and targeted CD8 T cell
GzmK-deficient mice to demonstrate the role of GzmK in vivo in driving inflammation, complement activation,
joint damage and fibroblast activation in the CIA mouse model of inflammatory arthritis.
 Together, these studies define a new pathway of complement activation mediated by lymphocyte-
derived GzmK, and its role in inflammatory fibroblast activation and joint pathology. These studies will unravel
key elements of how the pathway works and determine its role in arthritis in vivo. These findings provide new
insights into the immunopathology of RA and point to GzmK and CD8 T cells as potential new therapeutic
targets."
10861047,"The spinal cord houses the neuronal networks responsible for executing various motor tasks involved in
locomotion. These spinal networks receive descending commands from the brain and brain stem. Spinal cord
injury (SCI) disrupts the connectivity between the brain and the spinal cord locomotor networks, leading to a
significant loss of motor control. Despite a dire need to develop ways to restore motor function after SCI,
treatment options remain limited. We recently demonstrated that the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) could
directly control the locomotor central pattern generator in the lumbar spinal cord via cervical excitatory
interneurons (SI locomotor pathway), independent of the motor cortex. Based on the paradigm-shifting discovery
that the sensory cortex can directly modulate spinal locomotor networks, this proposal aims to define the
mechanism of this sensory cortical control of locomotion and harness this pathway to restore walking after SCI.
First, in Aim 1, using a head-mounted miniature microscope, we will use circuit-specific single-cell resolution
calcium imaging of SI-cervical pyramidal neurons in freely moving mice. This strategy will allow us to identify and
decipher the neuronal activity patterns correlated to the initiation and speed of locomotion. Moreover, using a
circuit-specific optogenetic approach, we will determine if direct and specific stimulation of this pathway is
sufficient to initiate movement in health and after SCI. Aim 2 will determine this pathway's anatomical connectivity
and integrity using intersectional viral tracing experiments and comprehensive mapping of SI-cervical pyramidal
axon collaterals. In Aim 3, to determine the therapeutic potential of this pathway for locomotor recovery after
spinal cord injury, we will employ acute optogenetic and chemogenetic strategies. Overall, understanding the
functional significance of the SI-locomotor pathway and delineating the anatomical connectivity and integrity
post-SCI will enhance our knowledge of this newly discovered circuitry and facilitate the development of
strategies to restore movement after SCI and other neurological conditions with impaired movement."
10726579,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Herein, a group of collaborative merit review applications (CMA) aim to advance the precision
management of bladder cancer (BCa), especially focused on the early stage initiation of urothelium as
a model of dynamic epithelial changes in response to smoking and deployment-related carcinogens.
Malignancies are the second most common cause of death among Veterans and BCa is the fourth
most common cancer in the VA. Among tumor types, 70% of BCa is confined to the superficial part of
the bladder (Stages T1, Ta, and CIS), with the remainder invasive of the muscle or metastatic. If BCas
are identified at an earlier stage, nearly all of these tumors are treatable with a combination of surgery
and intracavitary therapy. Yet, there are currently no validated or recommended screening procedures
to identify asymptomatic BCas and there are no methods to identify at-risk patients at an earlier and
more curable stage. The proposed CMAs aim to address these limitations and to significantly disrupt
BCa prevention, detection, risk stratification and precision treatment by dissecting the genetic and
molecular foundations of early stage BCa. The projects include the following: CMA1 aims to determine
the genetic and immune-suppressive landscape of CIS to identify new therapeutics and
immunotherapies. CMA2 investigates the plasticity of the urothelium to determine how PPARγ can
direct epithelial differentiation as a possible modulator of CIS. CMA3 will examine the epigenetic basis
of urothelial differentiation and the role of LSD1-inhibitor, Methysticin, as a chemopreventative agent to
restore the epigenetic imbalance of the urothelium. Finally, CMA4 will develop artificial intelligence
algorithms for enhanced cystoscopy imaging technologies or BCa detection and risk stratification.
These CMAs are linked both intrinsically among each other and extrinsically with all contributors already
supported by VA R&D with Merit Awards focused on BCa to maximize synergy and ensure success.
Rationale: More than 80% of Veterans report a history of tobacco smoking with 90% of Veterans with
BCa self-reported smokers. Unlike lung, prostate or colorectal cancer, there are no screening protocols
recommended for Veterans at risk for BCa. There is no primary care recommendation for uniform
evaluation of blood in the urine, and no urinary tests have a high negative predictive value that can
replace cystoscopy. Almost all patients with BCa develop blood in the urine at some time, but there is
often delays in pursuing an evaluation by months to years that lead to tumor progression due to lack of
referrals to urologic surgery for evaluation. Once diagnosed, the urothelium is often challenging to follow
and up 20% of invasive tumors will progress to higher stage cancer. Treatment for early stage invasive
bladder cancer is dependent on BCG immunotherapy, but BCG is frequently unavailable and
underutilized for maintenance and 30% of BCas become BCG unresponsive. Therefore, the three major
challenges for improving survival for patients with BCa are 1) early detection of high-risk tumors 2)
identification of progression to higher stage cancer and 3) treatment resistance to BCG immunotherapy.
Our preliminary data suggest that the urothelium has plasticity in early stage BCa that, if understood at
the genetic, epigenetic and molecular level, could be treated and driven to a more indolent cancer.
Based on our preliminary studies and the gaps in diagnosis and treatment we hypothesize that the
urothelium can be influenced by the state of epithelial differentiation and driven towards a more stable
state if detected at early time point."
10726581,"The overall goal of my research is to understand mechanisms underlying pathophysiology in chronic
diseases, in particular heart failure (HF) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). I aim to discover unknowns, establish
new paradigms, and identify novel targets for drug screening and clinical therapy. We apply integrative
approaches that include single molecule analysis, live-cell imaging, genomic and proteomic analysis, and
transgenic model animals to understand the fundamentals of intracellular signaling networks and their functional
roles in development of diseases. Over the past 16 years, I have received continuous funding from NIH, VA, and
private agencies. I am currently supported by two NIH R01 grants, a VA merit award, and a joint California
TRDRP grant. The results from my laboratory have significantly deepened our understanding of signaling
regulation and offered novel therapeutic targets for HF and AD. Through these endeavors, I have received an
AHA established investigator award in 2010 and established myself as a global leader in cardiac signaling
transduction.
 In the early years, my research focuses on novel features of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor (bAR)
signaling such as spatiotemporal regulation of cAMP-PKA cascades in cardiac contractile function. Over the past
10 years, I have expanded my research program to understand regulatory signaling networks in disease
development under chronic conditions such as inflammation and metabolic disorders. One of the highlights is
that we have described a membrane protein complex of insulin receptor (InsR) and b2AR broadly expressed in
different tissues. Activation of b2AR and InsR are critical regulatory mechanisms of both cardiovascular function
and metabolism. These receptors also modulate cognitive function including memory and learning, pain, emotion
and stress in the central nerve system. Dysregulation of these receptor signaling pathways has been linked to
development of HF and AD. Our recent studies have opened an exciting avenue in understanding cardiovascular
complications and neurodegenerative diseases associated with diabetes and metabolic syndromes. Several
active projects below are supported by ongoing funding from NIH and VA. The current VA merit grant aims to
characterize the essential roles of two proteins GRK5 and SAP97 in reduction (desensitization) of adrenaline
stimulation of a signaling molecule nitric oxide to enhance cardiac output. We will find how this regulation goes
wrong in heart diseases and thus offers novel strategies to treat heart diseases."
10726596,"The overall goal of our proposed research is to understand how long non-protein-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) impact the effect of common idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) risk variants on
transcriptional profiles and the clinical severity of IPF. In the past 5 years, we have found that: 1) a gain-of-
function MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950 is the strongest risk factor for the development of IPF (2-11); 2)
epigenetic mechanisms affect the expression of MUC5B (12) and MUC5B appears to be involved in the
pathogenesis of IPF (2, 13-15); and 3) IPF is a complex genetic disease with rare and common variants
contributing to the development of this disease (16), including pronounced changes in DNA methylation (17) and
transcriptional subtypes (18). We have recently sequenced across 10 IPF risk loci (5) in a large number of
patients with IPF (N=3,642) and controls (N=4,442), and have identified 10 common variants that represent the
only common independent signals in these IPF risk loci and in aggregate account for at least 40% of the risk of
IPF (16). However, there is no clear explanation for the molecular/clinical heterogeneity of IPF or the low
penetrance of either the MUC5B promoter variant (2) or the other common IPF risk variants (19-22) in this rare
disease (23, 24). Emerging findings suggest that lncRNAs could alter the impact of common risk variants by
influencing the molecular machinery that leads to IPF, and in turn account for the pathophysiologic phenotypes
of IPF. In aggregate, these observations lead us to postulate that the etiology and severity of IPF will be best
understood through an integrated approach that accounts for inherited factors and in turn their influence on the
coding-noncoding transcriptome. Thus, we hypothesize that lncRNAs regulate the effect of common IPF
risk variants on transcriptional profiles that drive the development and clinical severity of IPF. In Aim 1,
we will broadly identify lncRNAs that are dysregulated in IPF lung tissue by comparing lncRNAs from the lung
tissue of cases of IPF (N=450) to unaffected controls (N=300). We will use these data to identify differentially
expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs, and explore networks of mRNAs regulated by lncRNAs. In Aim 2, we will
determine cis- and trans-effects of IPF-associated common genetic variants on lncRNAs first in normal lung
tissue and then in the IPF lung. This will enable us to hone in on candidate lncRNAs dysregulated in IPF that
are driven by common IPF risk variants. In Aim 3, we will use a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to
identify and functionally validate regulatory variants within 10 key IPF risk loci that alter expression of coding and
noncoding candidate RNAs and are associated with clinical and/or pathological subtypes of IPF. The end-result
will be an enhanced understanding of the novel genes, regulatory pathways and networks, and molecular
mechanisms involved in the etiology and clinical severity of IPF."
10886818,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Environmental cues that are associated with food develop attractive and motivational properties that elicit
reward-seeking behaviors in animals. However, when food-associated cues no longer lead to rewards, animals
quickly adjust their behaviors by showing a transient increase of reward-seeking responses (invigoration) and a
set of behavioral responses that resemble frustrative behaviors in humans. Repeated exposure to reward
omission leads to behavioral attenuation that serves to suppress unproductive appetitive responses. Although
significant progress has been made in elucidating the brain structures that regulate the acquisition and the
extinction of reward-seeking responses, the neural circuits and brain mechanisms that control changes in
behavioral responses during the initial phase of reward omission remain elusive. Emerging evidence suggests
that neurons in the anterior portion of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (aPVT) are activated by reward-
associated cues and contribute to the regulation of emotional responses during unexpected omission of reward.
Whereas activity in the aPVT to nucleus accumbens pathway decreases reward seeking, activity in the aPVT to
central amygdala pathway increases it, suggesting that the aPVT is a potential candidate to regulate behavioral
invigoration during reward omission. Here we propose to study how cortical and subcortical inputs to the aPVT
regulate the dynamic activity of projection-defined aPVT neurons during reward omission. Using in vitro
electrophysiology, we will study the intrinsic properties and synaptic dynamics of distinct aPVT neurons and their
afferents. Using a food-seeking task in which rats are exposed to reward omission, we will investigate the
neuronal activity patterns of aPVT neurons in vivo, and correlate their activity with the animal's behavior during
the test. Subsequent gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments will test the sufficiency and necessity of
distinct aPVT afferents. These experiments will provide insights into the neural circuits that detect changes in
reward availability and rapidly adjust animals' behavior during the initial phase of reward omission."

Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) remains to be one of the leading causes of cancer-related death.
Patients with metastatic castration-resistant PCa or mCRPC often develop resistance to the 2nd
generation therapeutics including enzalutamide and the disease becomes deadly. Like many other
cancer types, PCa tumors display high cellular and epigenetic plasticity that are associated with
therapy resistance and progression to more lethal forms such as neuroendocrine PCs or NEPC.
Circadian rhythm (CR) regulates daily oscillations of major biological processes. Circadian disruption
(CD) is considered as a likely carcinogen. We found that PCa cells lost the normal CR regulation and
that one the CR regulators Rev-erbα/NR1D1 acts as a strong candidate driver of growth and survival
of mCRPC cells. We also found that Rev-erbα is overexpressed and amplified in metastatic CRPC
tumors and that its small molecule antagonists displayed high efficacy in inhibition of growth of several
PCa models. Our preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that Rev-erbα associates with several
epigenetic factors to activate multiple gene programs associated with advanced PCa. We hypothesize
that deregulated CR regulators such as Rev-erbα drives tumor plasticity by establishing aberrant
chromatin structures and that targeting the aberrant Rev-erbα function is efficacious and safe for
treatment of the lethal forms of PCa. In Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will establish the driver role of aberrant
Rev-erbα in tumor plasticity and therapy resistance and define the molecular mechanisms. In Aim 3,
we will use multiple models of therapy resistant CRPC to examine the efficacy of the Rev-erbα
inhibitors in sensitizing the treatment and the mechanism of action in blocking tumor plasticity."

Conventional dendritic cells (CDC) play a central role in protective immunity by connecting innate and adaptive
immune responses. CDCs can distinguish `self' from `non-self' (example pathogen) or `altered-self' (example
cancer) through specialized pattern recognition receptors and help orchestrate the appropriate adaptive immune
response. CDC1 and CDC2 are the two major subsets of CDCs with CDC1s having the unique capacity to cross-
present antigens that is critical for immunity against viruses and cancer. Circulating precursors of CDCs (Pre-
CDCs) infiltrate tissue where they differentiate into CDC1 and CDC2. The relative distribution of these CDC
subsets differ between tissue types and under pathological conditions, suggesting a role of tissue
microenvironment in Pre-CDC differentiation. What factors in the tissue microenvironment might regulate this
process, however, remains poorly understood. Our preliminary studies show that CDC1 differentiation is
regulated by local availability of the amino acid glutamine through its metabolic conversion into glutamate.
Glutamine uptake and utilization increases significantly in rapidly proliferating cells or during catabolic stress,
potentially creating a glutamine deficient local microenvironment. Hence, we hypothesize that metabolic
adaptations in tissue alters local CDC1 differentiation by modulating glutamine levels. In this proposal, we seek
to understand which steps of CDC1 differentiation is regulated by glutamate and its underlying molecular
mechanism. We will focus on epigenetic regulation of gene expression and oxidative stress as potential
pathways by which glutamate mediates this effect. Findings from the proposed work can potentially open new
lines of research linking tissue metabolic adaptations to its immune microenvironment."

Our research program is directed toward understanding the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation and
formulating treatment strategies for intestinal inflammatory diseases such as IBD. Our work has been published
consistently in reputable journals and cited extensively (December 20, 2017: h-index of 45). Our laboratory is
familiar with a vast number of techniques, from nanotechnology to molecular biology to cell biology. Over one
million adults and children in the US, including members of the VA population, suffer from IBD, with about 50,000
new cases diagnosed each year, according to the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of America. VA IBD patients
have a much higher rate of colorectal cancer compared to the general population (2.9% vs. 0.1%, according to
the National Center for Health Statistics). New therapeutic strategies based on a better understanding of the
pathogenesis of IBD will improve the clinical care of veteran and non-veteran patients with this disorder. We
have long recognized the value of interdisciplinary research in furthering scientific discovery, as important
research ideas often transcend the scope of a single discipline or program. In this context, we have promoted
collaborative interdisciplinary research between scientists/physicians with interests in gastroenterology at the
Atlanta VA Medical Center and scientists at the Institute for Biomedical Sciences of Georgia State University.
These multidisciplinary collaborations are intended to develop novel ideas that will enhance the diagnosis and
treatment of colitis and colitis-associated cancers that affect the VA population.

Osteoporosis (OP) is a degenerative skeletal disease which affects an estimated 200 million people worldwide
including 30% of all postmenopausal women in the United States and Europe. Hip fractures are the second most
common type of OP fracture and cause the greatest mortality and morbidity of all OP fractures, with the one-
year mortality rate reaching 20%. Clinical assessment of fracture risk is made via bone densitometric techniques
such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT), however, these
methods are poor predictors of hip fractures with sensitivities of less than 50%. There is thus a need to develop
adjunctive, novel, and accurate methods for non-invasively assessing bone quality to better inform clinical
treatment of osteoporosis and to enable new research discoveries in bone pathophysiology.
The proposed work builds on recent research conducted in the applicant’s lab based on magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) ultrashort echo time (UTE) pulse sequences for assessing bone material composition. I propose
to develop and validate a protocol for mapping bone susceptibility in the proximal femur in vivo. First, I will
evaluate the efficacy of regularization and deep learning methods for computing the ill-posed dipole inversion
through comparisons in cadaveric femora specimens with the gold standard susceptibility method, Calculation
of Susceptibility through Multiple Orientation Sampling. Next, I will investigate the extent to which magnetic
susceptibility is related to bone health through validation experiments with other imaging biomarkers and with
whole bone mechanical testing that mimics a sideways fall. Finally, I will assess the clinical feasibility of bone
susceptibility by tracking longitudinal changes following treatment in a small cohort of postmenopausal women.
Susceptibility measurement reproducibility and associations with DXA will also be quantified.
I anticipate that the results of this study can lead to a clinically feasible approach to measure bone health beyond
what is currently possible and could assist in future pharmaceutical or pathophysiological studies of bone
diseases."

DNA amplification is associated with pathological states such as neurological disorders, cardiac disease and
cancer. At least 50% of the amplifications in cancer are transient extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). The transient
behavior contributes to copy number plasticity, results in heterogeneous oncogene expression and alters
therapeutic response. The unanswered question remains as to whether distinct mechanisms control ecDNA copy
gains within cells and how they impact copy gain events associated with disease. My overall goal is to define the
principles regulating selective DNA copy gains and the associated plasticity, so we may control these events.
My laboratory was the first to discover a molecular basis for extrachromosomal transient site-specific DNA copy
gains (TSSGs) in the human genome. Specifically, we identified the first enzyme capable of driving site-specific
ecDNA amplification [the histone 3 lysine 9 and 36 tri-demethylase (H3K9/36me3) KDM4A] and demonstrated a
fundamental role for epigenetic states in controlling the predilection of specific DNA regions to rereplicate and
amplify. We discovered seven more chromatin enzymes- lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and demethylases
(KDMs)- that function in concert to control site-specific amplification in both non-cancer and cancer cells. These
studies established a critical role for chromatin factors and their associated states in regulating DNA
amplifications. With this NIGMS R35, my laboratory will expand our studies in order to elucidate: 1) the
fundamental mechanisms controlling DNA amplification; 2) the molecular processes and characteristics
promoting or preventing DNA amplification; and 3) the relationship between ecDNA generation and the
associated RNA heterogeneity/DNA mutation burden. We will address these points by leveraging microscopy-
based screens using genetic and chemical tools in order to identify key amplifiers, and in turn, generate
epigenome profiles coupled to genome organization maps associated with these pathways so that molecular
features controlling DNA amplification are resolved. These studies will also be coupled to state-of-the-art long
read sequencing and single cell (DNA and RNA) sequencing strategies so that the associated heterogeneity
within the cell population and individual cells can be correlated with the effect of the amplifier on TSSGs. These
studies are being conducted in non-transformed cells that have a nearly diploid genome so that additional
genomic anomalies and mutations do not impact these studies. Collectively, the data generated from these
studies will increase our knowledge about the molecular features governing DNA copy gains and the associated
heterogeneity, which will resolve novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in order to control copy number-
associated diseases in the years ahead."

The worldwide epidemic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a severe and costly threat to
public health. The current therapeutic options for NAFLD are exceedingly limited, especially for its severe form -
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which has no FDA-approved therapy. There is an urgent need to identify
novel therapeutic targets for NASH treatment. Thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) is a stress-induced gene,
and it has been implicated in NASH. However, the role of Txnip in NASH is controversial, which may be attributed
to the following two issues. Firstly, there are two genes in the Txnip gene locus: Txnip and Txnip antisense long
non-coding RNA Gm15441. Genetic deletion of Txnip also deletes part of Gm15441. Secondly, Txnip plays
critical roles in other metabolic organs, which interferes with its function in the liver. Therefore, previous studies
using Txnip global knockout mice were not able to reveal the liver-specific role of Txnip in NASH. Our preliminary
data demonstrate that Txnip protein is abnormally accumulated in NASH mouse livers. Our preliminary studies
also suggest that Txnip may promote hepatocyte apoptosis. Given that excessive hepatocyte apoptosis drives
NASH development, therefore, we propose a central hypothesis that inhibition of hepatic Txnip alleviates NASH.
In Aim 1, an antisense RNA based Txnip translational inhibitor will be developed for NASH treatment. In Aim 2,
we will dissect the functional role and mechanism of Txnip in NASH mouse liver. In Aim 3, we will investigate a
novel mechanism that causes Txnip protein accumulation in NASH mouse liver. Completion of this proposal will
provide critical insights into the functions and mechanisms of Txnip in NASH development. These studies will
also lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for NASH treatment."

 Osteomyelitis is an invasive infection of bone most commonly caused by the bacterial pathogen
Staphylococcus aureus. Successful treatment of osteomyelitis requires prolonged antibiotic treatment as well as
invasive surgical procedures to remove infected and nonviable bone. Despite these aggressive measures, nearly
1 in 5 patients with osteomyelitis will fail treatment. This includes patients who receive antibiotics with proven in
vitro activity against the causative pathogen. These observations position osteomyelitis as a paradigm for
treatment-recalcitrant infection. The goal of this proposal is to define bacterial and host factors that contribute to
antibiotic failure during osteomyelitis. We hypothesize that bacterial virulence factors and host responses that
promote physical shielding of bacteria in vivo contribute to antibiotic tolerance. Upon successful completion of
the proposed experiments, we expect to have defined targetable mechanisms underlying antibiotic failure during
osteomyelitis, with the ultimate goal of maximizing treatment efficacy, minimizing complications, and creating
new approaches to detect and combat antibiotic tolerance in humans.
 In preliminary studies using our established murine model of osteomyelitis, we demonstrate that S.
aureus rapidly develops tolerance to antibiotic killing in vivo. Histologic analyses reveal a characteristic
“pseudocapsule” surrounding bacterial communities in infected bone. Pseudocapsule formation is postulated to
involve key virulence factors known as coagulases and agglutinins, which together endow S. aureus with its
distinctive ability to coagulate blood. We hypothesize that these virulence factors contribute to antibiotic tolerance
during osteomyelitis by physically shielding bacteria within host tissues. Aim 1 will rigorously test this hypothesis,
while also identifying novel determinants of antibiotic tolerance using an unbiased, in vivo bacterial screen. We
will track the relative localization of antibiotics and bacteria using innovative new S. aureus reporter strains
coupled with fluorescent antibiotics. Aim 2 will test the complementary hypothesis that canonical host coagulation
contributes to shielding of bacteria and antibiotic tolerance. This Aim will also employ our new workflow for
imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) of bone, which will enable discovery-based profiling of host analytes that form
antibiotic barriers in vivo. We will also leverage IMS as a modality for label-free tracking of antibiotics in infected
tissues. Aim 3 will use paired bacterial isolates and serum samples from patients with osteomyelitis to test how
growth in a physiologically relevant medium alters antibiotic killing, and to link in vitro antibiotic tolerance to key
clinical parameters. Collectively, the experiments in this proposal will define mechanisms leading to antibiotic
tolerance during osteomyelitis, paving the way for new interventions that improve antibiotic therapy, limit
treatment failure, and reduce the morbidity of this debilitating disease."

Large gaps in current strategies for risk stratification and surveillance contribute to frequent late-stage detection
and poor outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our Translational Liver Cancer (TLC)
Research Center has made important scientific contributions that directly addressed HCC risk stratification and
surveillance in patients with cirrhosis. Specifically, we conducted a series of phase II and phase III biomarker
studies in patients with cirrhosis to validate 1) the first blood-based biomarker for risk stratification (PLSec-AFP),
2) abbreviated MRI for HCC surveillance, and 3) two biomarker panels, GALAD and Doylestown Plus for HCC
surveillance. We also conducted modeling studies to evaluate how these data can be incorporated into clinical
practice, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a precision surveillance strategy in these patients.
For our TLC renewal, we leverage our infrastructure and operational expertise to similarly develop an optimized,
evidence-based approach to early HCC detection in patients with indeterminate liver nodules (ILNs). Our
preliminary data demonstrate that patients with ILNs have an annual HCC risk of 6-10%/year, more than double
that of those with cirrhosis without ILNs; however, they experience wide variation in HCC risk and surveillance
strategies – with some patients who develop HCC failing to undergo surveillance in the year prior to diagnosis
and some patients undergoing repeated CT/MRI-based surveillance despite never developing HCC. Our work
highlights the need for accurate risk stratification and surveillance strategies in patients with ILNs to optimize the
overall value of early HCC detection programs – gaps that are directly addressed by our proposal.
We will leverage our Early Detection Research Network (EDRN)-funded Clinical Validation Center for HCC to
efficiently recruit a large cohort of patients with ILNs and (1) validate the effectiveness of a novel biomarker-
based risk stratification model, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of surveillance abbreviated MRI and contrast
enhanced ultrasound for detecting early-stage HCC, and (3) compare the cost effectiveness of surveillance
strategies including a precision screening model in patients with ILNs.
Our proposal aligns with the principles of precision medicine and would maximize benefits (via early tumor
detection) and minimize harms (via false positive results) for each patient, thereby optimizing the patient-
centeredness, cost effectiveness, and overall value of HCC surveillance in patients with ILNs. In addition to our
patient cohorts and platform of unique biomarker and imaging data, our TLC research center will contribute
methodological expertise in HCC early detection, biomarker validation, and HCC imaging to trans-network
projects. Overall, our proposal will transform our approach to early HCC detection in patients with ILNs by
validating evidence-based and cost-effective strategies to optimize HCC risk stratification and surveillance."

This application is for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award entitled “An
Alternative Pathobiology underlying Severe Asthma.” I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the
University of Pittsburgh seeking additional training in benchtop murine research techniques and bioinformatics
and ‘omics analysis to transition from benchtop to translational asthma research. The focus of my research is
on the role of Type-1 (T1) inflammation in asthma and how this pathway may contribute to disease severity.
While great strides have been made in understanding and treating traditionally described Type-2 (T2)
inflammation in asthma with novel biologic therapies, nearly 50% of asthma patients lack evidence of this
pathway, and even some with T2 inflammation fail to respond well to T2 therapies. A better understanding of
other inflammatory pathways in asthma and how they contribute to disease is essential to identifying novel
therapeutics for these patients. My preliminary data have demonstrated the presence of T1 inflammation marked
by increased expression of IFN-γ, the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5 as well as T1 expressing tissue resident
memory T-cells (T1 TRM) in ~30% of asthma patients. These patients tend to have more severe asthma, greater
exacerbations and higher use of systemic corticosteroids. However, the reliance on bronchoscopy for samples
has limited our ability to study the clinical effects of this pathway over time. Furthermore, our understanding of
the effects of T1 inflammation on the airways in asthma and the role of T1 TRM cells in maintaining/driving this
phenotype are unknown. This study aims to improve our understanding of asthmatic T1 inflammation in three
ways: (1) Utilize our T1 dominant murine severe asthma model to assess TRM establishment and reactivation in
T1High asthma. (2) To assess the importance of maraviroc (a CCR5 inhibitor) in effecting T1 specific changes on
the airway epithelium and mast cell prevalence. (3) The multicenter Severe Asthma Research Program provides
clinical data in a large number of asthma subjects with paired sputum samples that will allow us to measure T1
inflammatory markers, assess their correlation with clinical outcomes and identify future biomarkers to better
identify T1High asthmatics for future trials. This project will provide unique insight into a novel and poorly
understood pathway in asthma with the potential to yield exciting new treatment options for a highly prevalent
and severe disease. This study will also provide the opportunity for me to acquire skills in bioinformatics and
large ‘omics dataset analysis that will foster my development as a translational physician scientist in severe
asthma in addition to advancing my murine model skillset. The work will be carried out at the University of
Pittsburgh in the division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care which has a strong track record of developing
physician scientists and boasts a highly developed infrastructure for translational research. I have also
assembled a highly accomplished multi-disciplinary mentorship team that is internationally recognized in asthma
research, bioinformatics and machine learning."

The past decade has seen an unprecedented accumulation of data at the single-cell level giving rise to unique,
multimodal sets of gene expression patterns, morphologies, and electrophysiology characteristics. This high-
resolution census of neuronal types in the brain constitutes an essential step towards a mechanistic
understanding of circuits and brain computations. However, linking cellular identity and activity to circuits and
neurophysiological signals remains daunting. The central goal of this proposal is to develop a set of publicly
available computational models, tools and resources that allow testing mechanistic hypotheses about the role
of different neuronal types in neural circuit function, that can be used to analyze neural data, and can serve to
identify potential biomarkers of cortical function in the brain. The proposed approach starts with building
rigorous computational models of individual human neocortical neurons linking transcription, morphology, and
physiology. Next, we connect neurons into cortical circuits, emulate their activity and simulate the associated
neurophysiological signals generated from those circuits. At all steps, the models are guided by, and compared
to, existing state-of-the-art measurements. As a proof-of-principle, we use a human cortical circuit model to
study the impact of the hyperpolarization-activated non-specific cation current, Ih, carried by h-channels.
Specifically, we recently showed that Ih differences within human pyramidal FREM3 neurons alter their
synaptic integration properties. The existence of an Ih depth gradient along human layer 2/3 in FREM3
neurons in fact is a fundamental organizing principle of the supragranular cortex. Even so, its role and how it
affects circuit processing and associated neurophysiological signals remains unknown. The human cortical
circuit model provides an ideal testbed where hypotheses about the role of the FREM3 Ih depth gradient can
be tested. First, we hypothesize that while fundamental spike properties of FREM3 models remain broadly
unaffected by deep vs. superficial FREM3 Ih-differences, the circuit activity will be substantially affected and a
coincidence detection gradient will emerge along the cortical depth axis (facilitated by the Ih gradient in
FREM3). Furthermore, we hypothesize that deep in the circuit where FREM3 has both increased Ih and
coincidence detection, the local extracellular signals will exhibit lower power in the slower bands and increased
power in faster ones. Accordingly, we expect decreased Ih (superficial neurons) to lead to a relative increase in
power in theta-slow gamma and a decrease in the mid-high gamma band. To test these hypotheses, we will
instantiate specific perturbations in the Ih conductance of FREM3 in our circuit model while leaving all other
model parameters unperturbed. We expect that these tools, which will be shared with the scientific community,
will facilitate the dialogue between the study of cellular and cell type properties, neurophysiological
measurements, and mechanistic approaches to elucidate function in human brain circuits."

Differential responses to viral infections are influenced by the genetic makeup of the host. As a result,
sensitivity of humans to viral infections varies considerably, with some individuals withstanding strong viral
pathogens, such as the retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Studies of inherited resistance to
retroviruses in human populations are enormously complicated, making it difficult to dissect strong antiviral
effector mechanisms that can be taken advantage of when developing therapeutics and vaccines. However,
the variations in the susceptibility of inbred mice to viral infections make the mouse an excellent model for
mapping mechanisms and genes driving mammalian susceptibility and resistance to retroviruses. Exogenous
mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) represents a well-studied model of mucosally transmitted retrovirus. The
virus is acquired through the milk in the gut of suckling pups and is passed to the mammary glands by
lymphocytes, where it induces mammary gland tumors after several cycles of re-infection/re-integration.
Susceptibility to exogenous MMTV infection and subsequent mammary tumorigenesis differs drastically among
different mouse strains, ranging from absolute resistance to high susceptibility. Mice from the MMTV-resistant
YBR/Ei (YBR) strain become virus-infected, but do not develop mammary tumors, produce reduced virus titers,
and efficiently eliminate the pathogen in successive generations. In our preliminary studies we found that the
unique mechanism of virus control in YBR mice is unrelated to anti-virus antibodies (Abs), virus-specific CD8+
cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and NK T cells, but depends on Thy1+ lymphoid cells.
Moreover, the virus restriction is controlled by a single, dominant locus, which we named attenuation of virus
titers (avt) and have mapped to chromosome 18. Using genetic studies and computational analyses, we will
identify the gene responsible for this remarkable effector mechanism."

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major Ser/Thr phosphatase with complex regulation and composition.
Deregulation of PP2A holoenzymes leads to devastating human diseases, including multiple types of cancer and
neurological disorders. In recent years, whole exome/genome sequencing for the molecular diagnosis identified
broad disease mutations in PP2A subunits and substrates in cancer and neurological disorders. The diagnosis
of de novo PP2A mutations in developmental disorders enthused unprecedented multidisciplinary phosphatase
research and interactions with patient families. De novo mutations in several members of B56 family of PP2A
regulatory subunits, such as B56δ and B56γ, cause neurological disorders, known as Jordan Syndrome. The
same somatic mutations were found in cancer patients. Built on our preliminary cryo-EM, molecular dynamic
simulations, biochemical, single molecule, reverse phase protein array, and cell biology studies, here we aim to
decipher the mechanisms of B56 disease mutations in cancer and intellectual disabilities. We will determine the
cryo-EM structures of WT and disease variants of the PP2A-B56δ holoenzyme (Specific Aim 1), investigate how
intellectual disability (ID) mutations alter holoenzyme dynamics, activation phosphorylation, and interactions with
regulatory proteins, combining biochemical dissections, advanced molecular dynamic simulation approaches,
and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) (Specific Aim 2), and test our hypothesis
on the discriminating and merging mechanisms of B56δ and B56γ ID mutations in perturbing the cAMP negative
feedback signaling via MAPK and CREB signaling, respectively (Specific Aim 3). These studies will shed light
on a highly dynamic regulation machinery involving the folding of long disordered regions against the
holoenzyme core and a super-long dynamic interface harboring the majority of residues mutated in Jordan
Syndrome, multiple activation phophorylation sites, and regulatory elements that suppress both the phosphatase
active site and the substrate-binding groove."

 The goal of this project has been and remains to gain understanding of the biochemical basis for our
observation that retinol-binding protein 2 (RBP2) has an unsuspected role in the maintenance of body weight,
normal responses to a glucose challenge, and normal fasting hepatic triglyceride levels. We found that when
maintained solely on a control chow diet, 6-7-month-old Rbp2-deficient (Rbp2-/-) mice accrue significantly more
body weight as white adipose tissue (WAT), respond significantly less well to a glucose challenge, and possess
significantly more hepatic fat than matched wild type (WT) littermate controls. These phenotypes were fully
recapitulated by younger 55-day old Rbp2-/- and matched WT mice fed a high fat diet for 6-7 weeks.
 Our published work establishes that both RBP2 and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) are expressed in
enteroendocrine cells (EECs) within the gut, including by glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)
and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) expressing cells. Rbp2-/- mice show elevated circulating GIP levels in
response to an oral fat challenge. We further showed that RBP2 binds long-chain unsaturated 2-
monoacylglycerol (2-MAGs) with an equally high affinity as it does retinol and is consequently a physiologically
relevant 2-MAG-binding protein as well as a retinoid-binding protein. We identified that Rbp4-/- mice have
significantly diminished circulating GIP concentrations both fasting and after an oral fat challenge compared to
WT controls. RBP4 localizes to EEC secretory granules and is co-secreted along with GIP upon stimulation of
cultured EEC-enriched primary mouse intestinal cells. Since elevated GIP levels are associated with increased
body weight and adipose mass in both humans and animal models, we hypothesize that this contributes to the
metabolic phenotypes seen for Rbp2-/- mice. We are proposing 3 Specific Aims exploring the actions of RBP2,
RBP4, retinoid- and 2-MAG signaling in regulating EEC activities and synthesis/secretion of GIP and GLP-1.
 Specific Aim 1 will assess the involvement of RBP2, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and ATRA-RAR
signaling, and RBP4 in modulating EEC responses. This entails both in vivo and in vitro studies.
 Specific Aim 2 will assess the involvement of 2-MAGs and enzymes responsible for 2-MAG synthesis
(diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL)), 2-MAG degradation (monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and α/β hydrolase domain
6 and 12 (ABDH6 and ADBH12)) and 2-MAG actions (the cell surface cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (Cb1 and
Cb2) and GPR119 receptors) in modulating K-cell responses to dietary nutrient availability. These studies will
make use of the same methodologies employed in Specific Aim 1.
 Specific Aim 3 will provide greater understanding of whether RBP2 has a direct role in GLP-1
synthesis/secretion in both the small intestine and in the colon. Although we have reported the presence of
RBP2 protein in L-cells, unlike GIP and K-cells, we have not systematically studied GLP-1 or L-cell biology from
the perspective of what role RBP2 may have in this biology."

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a cofactor and signaling molecule that regulates critical processes from
DNA repair to axon degeneration. NAD+ levels decline with mitochondrial dysfunction, in aging, and in various age-
related pathologies. Moreover, studies have repeatedly shown that increased NAD+ levels are beneficial for cellular
and organismal healthspan. Multiple cellular compartments contain NAD+-synthesis and NAD+-consuming signaling
proteins, but little is known about the mechanisms by which NAD+ concentrations in each organelle are appropriately
tuned to metabolic and signaling demands. Mitochondria harbor up to 70% of cellular NAD+, and NAD+ acts as an
electron carrier in mitochondrial respiration and as a signaling molecule through the mitochondrial sirtuins. However,
it is not known how the mitochondrial NAD+ pool is established and maintained or how it contributes to cellular
metabolic control. Using gene co-essentiality analysis, we recently identified a mitochondrial transporter, SLC25A51,
required for the uptake of NAD+ into mitochondria. We hypothesize that SLC25A51 is a major factor in cellular NAD+
compartmentalization and a critical player in metabolic homeostasis and a cell’s response to stress. A major long-
term goal of our research program is to understand how cells regulate their mitochondrial NAD+ pool and NAD+
compartmentalization to control metabolism and signaling in health and disease. In the next five years, we will focus
on three areas outlined in this proposal: 1) understanding the biochemical mechanism and driving forces of
mitochondrial NAD+ transport by characterizing the activity of SLC25A51 in cell-free proteoliposome transport
assays; 2) determining how mitochondrial NAD+ transport is regulated, by identifying the signaling pathway and
transcription factors that regulate SLC25A51 expression and by elucidating how the protein is turned over in or
removed from the inner mitochondrial membrane; and 3) delineating how cytosolic-mitochondrial NAD+
compartmentalization contributes to metabolic regulation in the liver using SLC25A51 loss-of-function mouse
models. The results of our studies will provide important insights into the mechanisms of cellular NAD+
compartmentalization and identify new modes of metabolic regulation relevant for human disease. This research
program is aligned with our laboratory’s overall goals to understand the mechanisms of metabolic
compartmentalization, and specifically the role of mitochondrial transporters, in adjusting mitochondrial function to
metabolic demands and cell state, and responding to stress."

Epigenetic pharmacotherapy for substance use disorder (SUD) is a rapidly expanding area of research. With the
ability to bind to acetylated histones and regulate drug-induced transcriptional adaptations, members of the
bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family of proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT) have
emerged as promising therapeutic targets. To date, however, only pan-BET bromodomain inhibitors, small
molecules that bind to both bromodomains (BD1 and BD2) within all BET proteins, have been tested in SUD-
related experiments. The use of these non-selective pharmacological inhibitors in SUD models limits our
mechanistic understanding of individual BET proteins, bromodomain-selective functions (BD1 vs. BD2), and non-
bromodomain BET interactions that regulate drug-induced neurobehavioral adaptations. New evidence from our
laboratory indicates that selectively targeting individual BET domains and proteins is a novel and effective
strategy to reduce cocaine-induced behavioral and transcriptional responses without causing sides effects
observed with pan-BET inhibitors. To build on these exciting data and to advance the field of epigenetic
pharmacotherapy for SUD, we propose to use highly selective, clinically relevant treatments, viral-mediated
approaches, and multiomic analysis to investigate domain- and protein-specific mechanisms of BET proteins
during cocaine-seeking behaviors. To achieve these goals, we will first investigate the behavioral and cell type-
specific transcriptomic responses of domain-selective BET inhibitors in cocaine economic demand and
reinstatement procedures. Next, using co-immunoprecipitation and mass-spectrometry, we will characterize
BRD4 interactome changes following short- and intermittent-access cocaine self-administration, and in functional
studies, we will use newly developed tools to identify a role for non-bromodomain mechanisms of BRD4 in
cocaine self-administration. Finally, we will interrogate novel transcriptional and behavioral roles for BRD2 in
cocaine-seeking behaviors. Together, these experiments will provide significant contributions to the field of
addiction epigenetics as well as novel therapeutic targets to reduce cocaine use and relapse."

 Cells in a multicellular organism constantly communicate by ligand-receptor-mediated signaling to
coordinate their growth, development, and adaptation to the environment. The peptide ligands-triggered
signaling is the most abundant in this network in humans, dysregulation of which contributes to many prevalent
human diseases. However, knowledge of how the peptide ligand-triggered signaling is regulated by the
environment remains incomplete. We study a classical peptide ligand-receptor-mediated signaling pathway that
regulates the epidermal stomatal development in Arabidopsis thaliana, a naturally simplified and experimentally
accessible system. Stomata are micropores on the aerial surface of plants that facilitate gas exchange with the
environment. Stomatal development is flexibly adjusted under variable environmental conditions to optimize plant
adaptation, making it an attractive system for studies on environmental regulation of peptide ligand-triggered
signaling pathways. Upstream of the stomatal signaling pathway are a group of secretory ligands named
Epidermal Patterning Factors (EPFs), many of which are highly responsive to environmental cues. We found
that osmotic stress caused a dramatic reduction in stomatal density. Interestingly, the transcript of a putative
EPF ligand is preferentially induced under osmotic stress. Compared to wild-type plants, the epf mutants produce
more stomatal precursor cells under osmotic stress. With these new findings, we hypothesize that osmotic stress
inhibits stomatal development via enhancing the candidate EPF ligand-triggered signaling. Our study and others
have previously indicated that distinct EPF-triggered signaling pathways target different steps of the stomatal
developmental process. The specificity is, at least partially, due to the precise spatiotemporal expression of a
particular EPF ligand and the differential subcellular behavior of the receptor kinases including ERECTA-LIKE 1,
that transduce the EPF signaling. This MIRA proposal aims to comprehensively evaluate the osmotic stress-
induced EPF ligand-triggered signaling pathway by addressing the following three questions: 1) Elucidate the
osmotic regulation of the transcription of the candidate EPF gene; 2) Dissect the osmotic regulation of the
stomatal receptor complex; 3) Identify the targets of the osmotic stress-induced EPF signaling pathway.
Completion of this work is likely to provide valuable insight into our understanding of osmotic regulation of
organism development via peptide ligand-triggered signaling pathways."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options. The overall
5-year survival rate is only 11% and there is an unmet need for better therapies. For patients with homologous
recombination repair (HRR) deficient tumors (BRCA1/2, PALB2), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor
(PARPi)/platinum-based therapies offer the best-personalized treatment approach. However, the efficacy of
these treatments is often limited due to inherent (HRR proficient tumors) or acquired drug resistance. This
underscores a dire need to identify new targets to enhance the sensitivity of these promising agents and expand
the PDAC patient population that could benefit from them. We recently discovered that BARD1 (BRCA1-
Associated- Ring- Domain- 1), an obligate binding partner of BRCA1 and a key factor in HR, is upregulated in
PDAC cells under DNA damage conditions (Jain et al Cancers (Basel) 6;14(7):1848, 2022). We found that
deletion of BARD1 rendered PDAC cells (HRR proficient) extremely sensitive to PARPi/platinums and enhanced
DNA damage. Although, these effects may be attributed to BARD1’s canonical role in HRR, transcriptome
profiling of BARD1 silenced cells suggests BARD1 has pleiotropic effects on cellular functions linked to cell cycle,
cellular senescence, and DNA replication. In line with these predictions, we noted that BARD1 silencing strongly
reduced cell proliferation, decreased clonogenic capacity in vitro, slowed tumor growth in vivo of PDAC cells and
reduced expression of several cell cycle proteins, notably Polo-Like-Kinase-1 (PLK-1). PLK-1 is a serine
threonine kinase that strongly promotes the progression of cells through mitosis. PLK-1 is overexpressed in
PDAC and deregulation of PLK-1 activity contributes to genetic instability, which in turn leads to oncogenic
transformation. We hypothesize that PLK-1 interacts with BARD1 and this interaction is necessary for PDAC cell
response to DNA damage agents. We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. In aim 1, we will
determine the molecular interaction of BARD1 and PLK-1 in PDAC cells using biochemical assays, and in aim
2, we will determine if BARD1’s regulation of PLK-1 in PDAC cells is a driver of response to DNA damage agents,
using overexpression systems in a murine model. The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate the role and
significance of BARD1-PLK-1 interaction in PDAC and therapy response to DNA damage agents. The
completion of this project will lay the groundwork for development of novel targeted therapeutic strategies against
PDAC, and in the future could be applied to other cancer types as well.

The genetic factors required to establish a persistent infection in vertebrate hosts is one of the least
understood aspects of an infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. Multiple triggers for establishment of persistence
have been proposed. However, the lack of sensitive serologic and molecular assays has substantially impeded
work examining the biology of persistent spirochetes and their direct role in Post-Treatment Lyme Disease
Syndrome (PTLDS). We have developed two assays that overcome these major limitations and can facilitate
studies of persistent infections. The TBDCapSeq, a next generation capture sequencing assay, has a
sensitivity superior to quantitative PCR and enables B. burgdorferi genome assembly in host tissue samples.
The TBD-Serochip, a peptide array that can identify antibody responses to 170,000 linear peptides per assay,
provides unprecedented glimpses into B cell responses to the major antigens of B. burgdorferi. In this proposal
these assays will be employed in three Specific Aims that will examine molecular and genetic footprints of a
persistent B. burgdorferi infection. In Specific Aim 1, we will perform a comprehensive serologic analysis of
sera and cerebrospinal fluid from a well characterized PTLDS patient cohort. We will identify all major
immunoreactive epitopes in both specimen types. These data will be differentiated with serology data from
other non-PTLDS Lyme disease cohorts to implicate potential specific biomarkers of PTLDS. In Specific Aim 2,
we will employ the TBDCapSeq to identify molecular footprints of B. burgdorferi in the PTLDS patient cohort.
The combination of superior sensitivity of TBDCapSeq coupled with high sequencing depth will provide the
most robust molecular analysis of the link between B. burgdorferi and PTLDS. In Specific Aim 3, we will
establish an animal model for three distinct genotypes of B. burgdorferi in C3H/HeN, BALB/c and Peromyscus
leucopus mice. The capacity of each B. burgdorferi genotype for establishing persistence with and without
antibiotic treatment will be assessed and the TBDCapSeq will be used to identify genetic features unique to
persistent spirochetes. Along with genomic analysis, we will perform the first transcriptome investigation of
persistent spirochetes. Combined, these Aims will provide insight into the immune response of patients with
PTLDS and identify mechanistic triggers of spirochete persistence."
10918218,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) during pregnancy is rising, increasing the incidence of severe
maternal, neonatal, and obstetrical morbidity and mortality. Although maternal OUD can be effectively treated
with buprenorphine, leading to improved adherence to prenatal care and reduced obstetrical complications,
fewer than 1 in 5 patients receive medication treatment for maternal OUD. In large part, so few pregnant women
receive buprenorphine because it can be challenging to initiate effectively. Initiation (termed buprenorphine
induction) must begin while a patient is in moderate withdrawal. If induction begins too early, buprenorphine will
displace the other opioid from the μ receptor, precipitating severe withdrawal. Maternal withdrawal, both
precipitated and anticipated, is associated with high relapse rates, non-adherence and lower treatment retention
rates. Unsurprisingly, induction is a known critical time point for dropout in OUD treatment. Multiple alternative
protocols for buprenorphine induction have been reported, including successful methods that do not require an
opioid-free period or moderate withdrawal symptoms by using microdoses of buprenorphine, such as via a
transdermal patch, as a bridge induction method to full sublingual doses. However, buprenorphine induction
protocols have never been studied in pregnancy to determine the most effective type. We propose a prospective,
mixed-methods study at two OUD-specific prenatal clinics to evaluate the feasibility of conducting an randomized
controlled trial (RCT) comparing buprenorphine transdermal bridge induction versus standard sublingual
induction in pregnant patients with OUD. In Aim 1, we will qualitatively assess feasibility domains using semi-
structured interviews with 20 patients using buprenorphine to treat maternal OUD, 10 clinical team members
who treats them, and 5 research team members. We will present the RCT protocol to interviewees, and ask for
feedback on consensus-based criteria of recruitment capability, assessment procedures, and acceptability. We
will
solutions,
ask interviewees to conduct a “premortem” exercise to predict potential etiologies of RCT failure, brainstorm
 and adapt the RCT protocol accordingly. In Aim 2, we will quantitatively assess intervention and
research methods feasibility (eg, percentage of recruitment/retention goals, success of masking, intervention
fidelity) and preliminary efficacy to minimize withdrawal symptoms by conducting a pilot RCT of bridge versus
standard buprenorphine induction to treat maternal OUD (n=20 per arm). Results will provide preliminary data
to aid in design of large, multi-site trial powered to rigorously assess the efficacy of induction methods on
important obstetric and neonatal outcomes. If this larger trial shows that the bridge buprenorphine induction
protocol is effective in multiple populations, this treatment protocol could be widely disseminated to improve
outcomes for patients with maternal OUD and their infants."

Syndromes” seeks 5 years of additional support for protected time to maintain the principle investigator’s (PI)
mentoring activities, promote her career development & provide ongoing momentum to advance the applicant’s
research evaluating ARG therapy in sickle cell disease (SCD) and beyond. ARG is a nutritional supplement &
obligate substrate for the production of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator that becomes depleted during episodes
of SCD-related pain. The PI & her mentees have completed several randomized, double-blinded, placebo-
controlled trials (RCT) of ARG therapy in children with SCD & pain requiring hospitalization in both the US &
Nigeria. These studies combined found that ARG replacement therapy (ART) has opioid-sparing effects,
improved pain scores & cardiopulmonary function, decreased pain medication use & time-to-crisis-resolution
and was associated with a shorter hospital stay compared to placebo. The PI and colleagues also observed a
dose-dependent impact of ART that improved mitochondrial function & decreased oxidative stress in children
with SCD-pain. With recent NHLBI funding for a multicenter Phase 3 RCT utilizing the Pediatric Emergency Care
Applied Research Network (PECARN), the PI plans to perform the definitive study - Sickle Cell Disease
Treatment with Arginine Therapy (STArT) to determine the efficacy & safety of ART. Pain in SCD is the leading
cause of emergency room (ED) visits & hospitalizations, associated with an increased mortality rate. There are
no current therapies to treat the underlying mechanisms of acute pain, with interventions limited to hydration &
analgesia. The PI hypothesizes that ARG is a safe & inexpensive nutritional supplement with opioid-sparing
effects in children with SCD & pain, with potential value in low-resource environments. The STArT trial will
provide essential data for product development & will ultimately help gain FDA product approval for SCD if
benefits of ART are confirmed. The results of this proposal may ultimately lead to a change in clinical practice
for patients with SCD and targets an NCCIH strategic priority of non-pharmacologic management of pain. The
PI is highly committed to performing POR focused on nutrition science & in growing her mentorship reach to
include a diverse group of undergraduates, medical students, post-doctoral fellows & junior faculty, particularly
women & underrepresented physicians in clinical nutrition research, having mentored over 40 trainees
throughout her career. During the 5-year grant renewal, the candidate will also participate in a number of
leadership & mentorship courses, choosing curricula that will help advance the candidate as an educational
leader & mentor within academic medicine. The environment at Emory University is ideal to foster these goals
and will enhance the career development of the applicant as a mentor champion in integrative medicine in
partnership with the Georgia Clinical & Translational Science Alliance, enabling her to train mentees in the field
& increase the pool of evidence-based integrative clinical scientists."

Upper respiratory virus infection (URVI) is the leading cause of asthma exacerbation episodes. The underlying
immunologic mechanisms are poorly understood. Particularly, it remains unknown if URVI-induced asthma
exacerbation is exclusively a result of direct viral infection in the lower airway and lungs, in the nose and upper
airway, or both. Previous study has shown that the viruses commonly associated with asthma attacks were not
detected in the lungs of patients who died of asthma attacks. Recently, we observed that nasal virus infection
can remotely activate lung immunity without direct lung antigenic exposure. Nasal viral infection can recruit
antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the lungs. These activated APCs ingest antigen and migrate to pulmonary
lymph nodes, enhancing both innate and adaptive immunity to unrelated antigens in the lungs. Our data have
suggested that nasal mucosa can remotely regulate lung immunity without direct lung antigenic exposure (aka
“nose-lung cross talk”). Such nose-lung cross talk may also play a key role in URVI induced asthma
exacerbations. In the proposed study, we will 1) define the immune mechanisms underlying the nose-lung
cross talk after nasal viral infection; 2) determine the airway physiology airway inflammation after nasal viral
infection in mice with experimental asthma and the mechanisms by which URVI indued asthma exacerbations.
Completion of this project is expected to advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying URVI
induced asthma exacerbations, and to identify new preventative and therapeutic strategies for asthmatics. It
will also further define airway mucosal immunology, particularly the immune network underlying the nose-lung
cross talk, and to facilitate novel directions in nasal vaccine development and immunotherapy for diseases that
affect both the nose and lungs."

computational aspects of the grants, manuscripts, and the general goals of the lab as well as mentoring other
lab members. The goals of our projects are to study the mechanism of cancer progression and obtain clinically
relevant insights for pediatric and adult solid tumors. The R50 NCI Research Specialist Award would provide
me with the necessary funds to continue to further develop my computational tools and ongoing support for
the following NCI-funded projects: (1) Development of Advanced Preclinical Models for Pediatric Solid Tumors
(R01CA243555). There are three main goals to this project: a) verify that matched patient tissue and patient-
derived xenografts (PDX) or PDX-derived cell lines are transcriptionally and molecularly similar; b) utilize high-
throughput analyses to nominate drug targets for testing, and c) study drug resistance using single-cell
RNAseq technologies. (2) Development of Novel Protein-based Therapeutics for Lung Cancer
(R01CA225103). The main goals of this grant are to understand the biology of CLCF1-CNTFR as it relates to
adult lung cancer and evaluate the synergistic outcomes of the engineered “decoy” CNTFR receptor
(eCNTFR) with other compounds (e.g., eCNTFR+ PDL1 checkpoint inhibitor). (3) Investigate the Role of Long
Non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) in Sarcoma Pathogenesis (R01CA211657). The goals of this grant are to
elucidate the role of lncRNA EWSAT1/2 in chromatin remodeling at EWS-FLI repressed enhancer sites,
utilizing ChIRP-Seq and ATACseq. Other lncRNAs revealed from a prior lncRNA CRISPR-mediated
interference screen will also be investigated for their role in Ewing Sarcoma using both in vitro and in vivo

10909318,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Developing effective strategies for cancer control requires rigorous analysis of empirical evidence and
similarly rigorous analysis to address inevitable gaps in empirical evidence. During the previous project
period, the Principal Investigator provided critical statistical support for a broad spectrum of research studies
focused on prostate cancer, ranging from basic science experiments through clinical trials and population
modeling studies. In this renewal application, he will continue to provide biostatistical analysis services for a
multi-project translational prostate cancer research program and computer modeling expertise for a cancer
surveillance research program that uses biomathematical models to address evidence gaps and inform
population prostate cancer policies. He will also serve as lead modeler in the Data Modeling and Analytics
Core of a new multi-project research program that will investigate clinical utility of novel cancer diagnostic
technologies and multi-cancer early detection tests. Successfully supporting these research programs
requires broad expertise in biostatistical methods, computer programming, and data analysis to identify and
implement appropriate methods, interrogate model assumptions, and bracket uncertainty in results.
Outstanding scientific collaboration and communication skills are essential to explain strengths and
limitations of selected approaches and to bring projects from the scientific inquiry phase through peer
review so that their results can impact the delivery of care. During the previous project period, the Principal
Investigator consistently demonstrated all these skills and has been instrumental in establishing his
research group's leadership in cancer modeling for evidence generation and policy development. Planned
studies for the renewal period include modeling of natural history and outcomes for new multi-cancer early
detection tests, investigating outcomes of strategies for precision early detection and treatment, and
identifying targeted screening and treatment strategies to reduce health disparities. Renewal of the Principal
Investigator's Research Specialist award will facilitate his research group's continued stellar level of
productivity and foster his continued dissemination of high-impact research characterized by statistical and
modeling approaches that are transparent, rigorous, and reliable."
10929475,"Ocular inflammatory diseases are the primary cause of blindness in the USA. While emergence of ocular
inflammation can be genetic or idiopathic, pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses that infect the eye
are primary causes. Microbial infections are treated with antimicrobials followed by anti-inflammatory drugs
such as dexamethasone, prednisone, cyclosporine etc. The treatment regimen for these anti-inflammatory
drugs is prolonged and can last up to many months or even years. While systemic dosing is often avoided
unless necessary, topical dosage regimens can have low patient compliance due to repeated
administration requirements per day. One such ailment that affects millions of people around the globe is
ocular herpes. Primary infections are usually seen in children or adolescents and associated with vesicular
dermatitis, follicular blepharo-conjunctivitis, superficial punctate keratitis (SPKs) or dendritic ulcer with
preauricular lymphadenopathy. However, herpesviruses can reside forever in the host latently and cause
recurrent ocular infection in patients of all ages. While the most common treatment for treating active ocular
herpes infection includes daily dosing of Acyclovir (ACV) or ACV analogs, curbing post viral inflammation,
which can cause ocular pain and permanent clouding of the cornea, is performed by topical glucocorticoid
treatments such as prednisone or dexamethasone. These topical glucocorticoid therapies are avoided
during active viral replication and only prescribed in conjunction with oral antivirals to avoid the risk of
involving deeper stromal structures with threats to vision. While topical glucocorticoid treatments are
effective in reducing inflammation in most cases, they require repeated dosing (6-10 times daily) and suffer
from poor ocular retention. A simple yet effective way to improve ocular retention time for topical therapies
is to use sustained drug release platforms. We have recently shown that ACV loaded into highly porous
activated carbon termed as drug encapsulated carbon (DECON), can effectively adsorb to the corneal
surface and deliver drug in a sustained fashion. We showed that use of DECON to deliver ACV, reduced
the dosage frequency from 3 in a single day to a single dose once every alternate day in mice. In this
regard, we propose to demonstrate a new use for DECON as a sustained drug release platform to deliver
dexamethasone during post viral inflammation period. In this proposal, we would like to (1) understand the
efficacy of drug loading, retention and release of dexamethasone from DECON using in vitro, ex vivo and in
vivo models and (2) through clinically relevant metrics assess DECON’s ability to reduce infectious and
non-infectious suppress inflammation during post viral replication period."

Acquired Long Q-T Syndrome (aLQTS) is a change in the electrocardiogram (EKG) due to lengthening of the
ventricular electrical event, the action potential (AP). This lengthened AP predisposes to a lethal arrhythmia
and sudden death. aLQTS is induced by many drugs approved by the FDA. However, the approved doses are
limited by this side effect. The slow delayed rectifier, IKs, is a K+ current that can prevent aLQTS by shortening
the APD. This proposal focuses on developing candidate agents that can eliminate the APD prolongation
induced by drugs that cause aLQTS. There are 5 steps that regulate opening of the channel, voltage sensor
activation, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2), Calmodulin, ATP and opening of the pore. Two of
these, voltage sensor activation and PIP2 binding, have led us to two candidate compounds for aLQTS.
Because many drug candidates fail due to cardiac toxicity, it is important to investigate all mechanisms
controlling channel opening. The first aim, Aim 1, investigates how calmodulin and ATP binding and pore
opening can be stimulated by novel agents to increase IKs. The systematic process by which the selection of
these novel agents is achieved is called Full Spectrum Rational Drug Design. The structure of the channel is
studied and the binding sites for compounds to modify particular steps in channel opening are determined
(e.g., calmodulin and ATP interactions and pore opening). A computer program uses this structural information
to screen a chemical library of more than 1 million compounds for those most likely to bind near to the
structurally defined site. Multiple compounds have already been identified as potentially effective and
preliminary data are provided from these compounds for each potential site. Aim 1 tests these compounds to
determine their action on IKs, as well as their dose response curve and selectivity. The proposed mechanistic
studies of each therapeutic site will provide insight into any antiarrhythmic drug designed to target IKs. The
second aim, Aim 2, focuses on the effects of the hit agents on the ion channel’s function and action potential in
canine ventricular and atrial myocytes. Each optimal drug candidate from Aim 1 will be studied on the
biophysical properties of IKs. They will also be studied on the action potential at multiple concentrations,
frequencies of stimulation, and in the absence and presence of a β agonist in both control conditions, and
those that prolong the APD as a model for drug induced aLQTs. Atrial myocytes are included because the
lead compound must not cause atrial arrhythmias as a measurement for safety."

Disrupted sleep and daytime sleepiness are among the most common non-motor symptoms (NMS) of
Parkinson’s disease (PD). Mechanisms underlying these symptoms are not well understood, and treatment
options remain limited. The endogenous human circadian system, which is most effectively synchronized by
ocular light exposure, has a critical role in regulating sleep and sleepiness. Our investigations in patients with
PD revealed: (i) blunting of the circadian rhythm of melatonin, a well-established marker of circadian rhythms;
(ii) changes in circadian timing (“phase”) of clock gene expression; and (iii) beneficial effects of bright light
therapy, a circadian-based intervention, on sleep and wake consolidation. In this project, we propose to expand
this line of investigation and examine melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells
(ipRGC) across the continuum of PD. The ipRGC give origin to the retinohypothalamic tract through which they
project light stimuli to the central circadian pacemaker and synchronize circadian rhythms to external light, thus
affecting circadian and sleep behavior. A recently proposed surrogate marker of melanopsin function in humans
is the post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) obtained using non-invasive chromatic pupillometry.
To quantify the relationships among ipRGC function, circadian rhythms, sleep, and sleepiness, we will study four
groups of participants: (i) advanced PD (n=20), (ii) de-novo, drug-naïve PD (n=20), (iii) REM Sleep Behavior
Disorder, which represents a prodromal stage of an evolving synucleinopathy, such as PD (n=20), and (iv)
healthy controls (HC) (n=20). After the screening, participants will wear an actiwatch for continuous activity
monitoring and keep daily sleep diaries during a 14-day baseline period. Participants will undergo pupillometry
and complete questionnaires about sleep and sleepiness, and a subset will undergo Dopamine Transporter
SPECT Imaging to quantify nigrostriatal denervation. Participants will be subsequently admitted for inpatient
assessment of circadian markers, sleep, and sleepiness, including overnight polysomnography, followed by
multiple sleep latency testing and a 24-hour Circadian Protocol for blood sampling for melatonin measurements.
Aim 1 will test if melanopsin-dependent retinal phototransduction is altered across the continuum of PD
compared with HC. Aims 2 and 3 will test the hypothesis that melanopsin-dependent retinal phototransduction
is correlated with circadian amplitude and sleep and/or sleepiness across the continuum of PD compared with
HC. Exploratory Aim 4 will examine associations between melanopsin-dependent retinal phototransduction and
imaging metrics of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Participants enrolled in years 1-3 will undergo a two-
year follow-up pupillometry, actigraphy, and sleep/sleepiness assessment. Short-term, the project will provide a
foundation for investigations of retinal/melanopsin physiology in regulating sleep, sleepiness, and other NMS in
PD. Long-term, the work will advance the development of novel circadian-based interventions aimed at retinal
degeneration in PD, such as photoreceptor-specific light therapy or melanopsin gene therapy."
10867488,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria poses a grave threat to public health. To outcompete susceptible
bacteria and increase in prevalence, resistant strains must mitigate fitness costs incurred by resistance-
conferring mutations and genes. However, not every strain of a bacterial species can acquire and maintain
genetic determinants of resistance equally well, yielding a complex evolutionary landscape between
susceptibility and resistance. Elucidating the nature and diversity of the mechanisms that support acquisition
and maintenance of resistance will allow us to understand how resistant strains emerge and spread and
thereby accelerate development of desperately needed new strategies to prevent and treat resistant
infections.
We focus on the clinically important pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae (the gonococcus), given its high burden
of disease (nearly 700,000 reported cases in the US in 2021), the imminent threat of untreatable infection, and
the ease of experimental manipulation. Our goal is to define the genetic networks that support acquisition and
maintenance of resistance to the most clinically important antibiotics for N. gonorrhoeae treatment: the last
approved antibiotic, ceftriaxone; ciprofloxacin, for which rapid diagnostics for directed therapy are approved in
Europe; and the two drugs in Phase 3 trials, zoliflodacin and gepotidacin. To do so, we will leverage a dataset
that includes genome sequences and antibiotic susceptibility profiles for ~18,000 clinical isolates and a library
of hundreds of selected clinical isolates, representing the species diversity. We will use computational and
experimental methods, including population genetics and statistical tools to identify genetic differences in sub-
populations; high-throughput bar-coded library and experimental evolution to define the loci that impact
resistance acquisition as a function of genetic background; genome manipulation to validate links between
genotype and resistance phenotype; and mechanistic studies to elucidate how these genetic loci influence the
fitness landscape between susceptibility and resistance.
We expect that the results from these studies will define the stepping-stone mutations that contribute to
acquisition and maintenance of resistance to the antibiotics of highest clinical importance in N. gonorrhoeae.
These results can be applied to improving clinical management strategies and public health surveillance
efforts. Moreover, the system we establish here can be used to further probe the biology of N. gonorrhoeae
and provides a framework for the development of similar systems to dissect the genetic networks of resistance
in other bacterial pathogens."
10932924,"Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), recognized by the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize
in Chemistry to Dr. Joachim Frank of our research team, uses electron microscopy (EM) of specimens of
biological molecules embedded in vitreous ice via rapid cryogenic cooling. Time-resolved cryo-EM (TRCEM),
an expansion of cryo-EM in which specimens are examined resulting from reactions occurring for a series of
controlled time durations, allows studies of short-lived intermediate states of biomolecular events and has
recently been applied successfully to investigate several bacterial translation systems with reaction times
ranging between 20 and 600 ms. TRCEM studies at higher time resolutions, however, have not been possible
as existing specimen preparation methods preclude reaction times below 20 ms from being achieved. This
capability gap is highly limiting, because there are a large number of ion channels and receptors implicated in
human diseases with activation and gating times on the order of 1 ms or less. In addition, existing cryo-EM
specimen preparation methods use devices that are each hardwired for a particular reaction time, which is
inefficient and may cause inconsistencies in specimen quality.
 We will develop a microfluidic cryo-EM specimen preparation system, termed the High Uniformity and
Resolution Reaction Intermediates (HURRI) system, to address these challenges. The system consists of a
microsprayer or a line array of microsprayers in combination with a uniform reaction control and spray
cryocooling (in short, react-cryocool) unit. The microsprayer rapidly mixes two reactants at a low flow rate,
atomizes the mixture into monodisperse droplets, and delivers and deposits the droplets onto an EM grid. In
the react-cryocool unit, the grid is rapidly transferred into a nearby cryogen spray, en route to which reactant
molecules react for a short time independent of their on-grid position until being vitrified. Combining the
microsprayer and react-cryocool technologies minimizes the length of the overall reaction zone as well as
variations in the reaction time experienced by different reactant molecules. Thus, HURRI will be capable of
generating specimens with submillisecond reaction times at high resolution and low dispersity. In addition, the
reaction time will be tunable in that a given HURRI instrument will, without requiring modifications of any
physical components, allow generation of specimens at a series of reaction times needed for a study. The
reactant flow rates at which HURRI operates will also be one order of magnitude lower than those used in
existing specimen preparation methods, thereby reducing the use of biological material. As such, the HURRI
technology will enable highly efficient TRCEM studies of fast-reacting biological systems at an unprecedented
high time resolution. This potentially transformative utility of HURRI will be demonstrated with a TRCEM case
study of type 1 ryanodine receptor/calcium release channels (RyR1), the largest known ion channel that is
required for numerous critical cellular functions."
10876386,"There are currently an estimated 476,000 cases of Lyme disease annually in the United States, caused by the
bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) and more cases every year. At least 10% of people with Lyme disease
experience persistent symptoms after standard antibiotic treatment. Currently, there are no tools to predict
Lyme disease illness trajectories; a significant barrier to research progress. A primary goal of this research
proposal is to identify a biomarker that accurately predicts which patients go on to recover, and to advance
understanding of host immune responses and disease pathomechanisms contributing to persistent symptoms.
While there historically has been a significant focus in the field on using bulk IgG and IgM antibodies to
diagnose Lyme, instead we quantified all the different IgG subtypes, IgE, and IgA isotypes of antibodies. We
found that the plasma of acute Lyme patients who went on to fully recover after antibiotics contained opposite
levels of subtypes and isotypes than patients who developed persistent symptoms. We identified a novel
protective immune profiling ratio of the different antibody types in patients who went on to recover. We
hypothesize that this antibody ratio is a biomarker that can predict who recovers from Lyme disease
post-antibiotics and who will go on to have persistent symptoms.
To further explore this, we developed a new FLow-based Immune Profiling technology that we call FLIP to
better profile the isotypes and subtypes of antibodies that bind to Bb. The FLIP innovatively uses live Bb as
bait to precipitate out pathogen specific antibodies. Next, we propose to conduct deep analysis into immune
mechanisms contributing to persistent symptoms. This includes testing the downstream immune effector
functions of IgG subtypes and different isotypes like IgA and IgE that have previously been largely overlooked
in Lyme research. This is important because we found concerningly high levels of IgE that binds to Bb in a third
of people experiencing persistent symptoms. In mice this IgE triggers mast cell degranulation. This could
indicate the development of an allergy type response to Bb or parts of Bb that are also found in other bacteria,
and point to treatment options used for allergies. We propose to further refine our novel predictive immune
biomarker ratio and test our new FLIP technology on multiple patient cohorts including acute Lyme patients,
patients with persistent symptoms, and healthy controls. We are proposing to turn our current cross-sectional
study into a new prospective study so that we can test if our antibody ratio is truly predictive and accurate.
There is immense field-wide significance for this research. Creating the ability for scientists and physicians to
predict illness trajectories can enable smaller and more cost-efficient clinical trials by focusing on those at the
highest risk of not recovering. In the future, it could inform clinical care and enable new targeted therapeutics
that prevent long term illness by helping immune systems match the protective antibody ratio we found, and
more effectively respond to Borrelia burgdorferi."

research independence using implementation science principles to address complex anticoagulation problems."
10903842,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This mentored career development proposal will 1) generate a novel multimodal arousal-based objective
biomarker of cognitive, social, and sensory outcomes in infants with DS and 2) establish Dr. Rebecca Grzadzinski
as an independent clinical researcher in behavioral and neurobiological characteristics of infants with DS. The
overarching hypothesis is that atypical arousal patterns in early life influence how an infant with DS interacts
with, samples from, and learns within a multisensory environment. Building upon neurobiological findings in
typical and neurodevelopmental disorders, we hypothesize that 1) social arousal is associated with parent-
reported social skills as well as amygdala volume, 2) non-social arousal is associated with parent-reported
sensory reactivity and occipital volumes, and 3) habituation to stimuli is associated with estimates of cognitive
ability and frontal lobe volumes. By identifying these arousal patterns in real-time in response to specific, well-
controlled stimuli, we can begin to develop novel early interventions that are tailored to the infant's unique arousal
profile. Linking arousal dynamics with underlying neurobiology not only validates the constructs but also provides
targets for dissection in preclinical models of DS. This proposal is an unprecedented and time-sensitive
opportunity to capitalize on the largest longitudinally followed sample of infants with DS with robust behavioral
and neurobiological phenotyping. The foundation of this work leverages the ongoing data collection pipeline of
infants with DS from 6 to 24 months of age within the multi-site, longitudinal Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS;
PI: Piven; R01MH118362; PI: Botteron; R01HD088125-01A1). With the support of this proposal, stimuli designed
to elicit arousal-based responses will be added to the standard IBIS battery. Parent report and direct assessment
measures will be extracted from the IBIS database and arousal biometrics will be linked with concurrent and
longitudinal metrics of cognitive, social, and sensory behaviors in infants with DS. Dr. Grzadzinski has assembled
an expert mentorship team, including Drs. Piven (Director of IBIS) and Hazlett (UNC Site PI), who will mentor
her during completion of this project and ensure she has access to all the IBIS resources necessary to bring this
project to fruition. Drs. Lynch, Rodriguez-Romaguera, and Vora complete her mentorship team by adding
methodological, translational, and clinical expertise needed to guide Dr. Grzadzinski toward independence. This
project is a groundbreaking opportunity to validate early arousal biomarkers of cognitive, social, and sensory
outcomes in infants with DS and ultimately guide early intervention and preclinical research in DS. This
proposal aligns with the NIH INCLUDE Project Research Plan to collect deep phenotyping data on individuals
with DS by linking with existing cohorts and will position Dr. Grzadzinski to be a highly successful independent
clinical researcher dedicated to improving the lives of individuals with DS and their families."
11138197,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory disease that affects a large portion of the U.S.
population, resulting in poor quality of life for those affected and utilizing billions of dollars of health care
resources. Efforts in my lab have focused on understanding patterns of inflammatory heterogeneity in large CRS
populations with a goal of improving disease endotyping and developing personalized care pathways. I am
devoted to mentoring the next generation of clinician-scientists in the field of rhinology and chronic rhinosinusitis
research. The number of physicians and other surgeons pursuing clinical or translational research is declining,
and this is particularly true in the fields of rhinology and otolaryngology. Maintaining a strong pipeline of trainees
on research-related career paths is crucial for the development of the subspecialty and scientific advancement
of the field. This will be a prospective translational cohort study to identify the clinical implications and longitudinal
stability of chronic rhinosinusitis endotypes. We will enroll CRS patients through our well-established
biospecimen repository and determine the stability of inflammatory mediator levels and associated endotype
assignment over multiple seasons and determine whether these changes are associated with sinonasal microbial
community structure. We will also confirm the longitudinal effects of two commonly used immune-modifying
interventions (endoscopic sinus surgery and anti-IL4/13R biologic therapy) on inflammatory mediator levels and
endotypic assignment. Collectively, these translational studies will substantially advance basic knowledge of a
common airway disease that impacts millions of patients, while providing a range of investigative opportunities
for mentees interested in CRS and mechanisms of upper airway inflammation. My research program is centered
around a patient-oriented approach that incorporates patient-derived specimens, patient-reported outcome
measures, and personalized approaches to care. I anticipate that mentee participation in this research program
will lead to new and exciting avenues for patient-oriented research to further characterize CRS endotypes and
evaluate the effects of targeted therapies; thus, this project will provide a conducive setting for developing the
next generation of clinician-scientists in the field. I have a history of continual extramural funding, more than a
decade of experience as a mentor to trainees at all levels, and institutional support to enhance my own skills that
will augment the support proposed through the K24 mechanism."
10927436,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
With prostate cancer (PCa) being among the most common cancers in men worldwide (estimated 1,600,000
cases, 366,000 deaths annually), the need for new biomarkers for early detection, diagnosis, monitoring, and
prognosis remains urgent. Among the available management alternatives for PCa, active surveillance (AS) is
recommended as an initial treatment for males with very low-, low- and favorable intermediate-risk. AS relies on
serial monitoring over time to identify progression, so that the patient receives timely curative treatment, while
reducing morbidities related to definite treatment delivered at time of diagnosis. However, identifying ideal
candidates for AS is challenging. Despite its limited specificity, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most
used test for early detection of PCa. Other factors based on biopsies such as the Gleason Group (GG), are
affected by limited biopsy sampling, while the non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been
connected to false positives and false negatives. Finally, the implementation of molecular prognostic tests, such
as Decipher in AS populations has been limited due to the lack of randomized trials using actual AS patients.
Previous work suggests that PCa progression can be dependent on the interactions between extracellular matrix
(ECM) proteins in the stroma with various cell types including the immune system and cancer cells. On this
regard, my team of collaborators has developed clinical imaging techniques such as, diffusion basis spectrum
imaging (DBSI), and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, that visualize
inflammatory, stromal/ECM, and cancer cell components of the tumor that could be associated with cancer
progression. Therefore, I propose to leverage radiomics, a method based on data-characterization algorithms to
extract imaging features, to detect patterns in pre-op MRI with the guidance of DBSI and MALDI toward optimally
selecting AS candidates. My central hypothesis is that the spatial analysis of structural components in the ECM
extracted from the co-registration of molecular and radiological imaging, accurately predicts tumor upgrading
and upstaging in PCa. In Aim 1 I will identify a baseline radiomic signature derived from pre-op MRI to accurately
predict tumor upgrading (i.e., from GG1 to GG2 or higher) by augmenting well-established biomarkers (i.e., PSA,
GG, Decipher), with an exploratory SubAim co-registering DBSI and MRI to improve the prediction. In Aim 2, I
will use MALDI co-registered with pre-op MRI to guide the derivation of the radiomic signature to accurately
predict tumor upstaging (i.e., from T1/T2 stage to T3 or higher). This research is innovative because, to date, no
distinct spatial signatures linked with the ECM and derived from co-registered molecular and radiological imaging
have been associated with prediction of tumor progression in PCa. Furthermore, this K22 career transition award
will provide me with the training and resources needed to advance my career as an independent researcher in
the field of data sciences applied to cancer research, and also to support my goal of recruiting the nation’s most
talented students from backgrounds nationally underrepresented in cancer research."
10725139,"SUMMARY
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) affect 15 million women in the United States every year and treatment for UTIs is
becoming more difficult due to high rates of antibiotic resistance. Further, UTIs are highly recurrent. Between 20
and 40% of UTI episodes are followed by recurrent UTIs (rUTIs), with some women suffering as many as 6 or
more recurrences per year. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the major causative agent of UTIs.
Antibiotic resistance within UPEC isolates is rising, and the emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
producing and fluoroquinolone resistant strains is a serious public health concern. Type 1 pili, tipped with the
mannose binding FimH adhesin have been shown to be essential for bladder colonization and UTI pathogenesis
in multiple mouse models. FimH mediates binding to mannosylated uroplakins lining the bladder surface to
facilitate colonization and invasion into bladder cells where they rapidly replicate into intracellular bacterial
communities that protect UPEC from immune cells and antibiotics. In addition, FimH facilitates the ability of
UPEC to establish a reservoir in the GIT, from where they can seed UTIs by ascending from the periurethral
area into the bladder. While UPEC are genetically variable, FimH is part of the core E. coli genome, although
rare strains have been found with mutations in the type 1 operon. Immunization against FimH protects against
UPEC UTI in murine and monkey cystitis models and a FimH-based vaccine has been allowed by the FDA for
patients suffering from multi-drug resistant UPEC. In animal models, protection is antibody-mediated, as FimH-
specific IgG antibodies are found in the urine from protected animals and can protect from UTI through passive
transfer. Intriguingly, UPEC abundance in the gut is increased at the time of symptomatic UTI, suggesting that
gut colonization is a key step in the rUTI cycle. Additionally, studies in this proposal show that eliciting a mucosal
antibody response against FimH can reduce UPEC colonization of the gut. In light of these findings, this proposal
addresses the hypothesis that anti-FimH induced antibodies can combat rUTI by two distinct mechanisms: i)
prevention of UPEC binding to the uroepithelium; and ii) interference with UPEC colonization of the GIT, thereby
lowering the likelihood of UPEC introduction into the urinary tract. The aims of this proposal are to: i) determine
how mucosal vaccination against FimCH reduces UPEC gut colonization (Aim 1); ii) exploit vaccine induced B
cell responses to isolate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to FimH and determine their epitope specificity (Aim 2);
and iii) use these mAbs in mouse models of GIT colonization and cystitis in order to elucidate mechanisms of
protection (Aim 3). The research plan will unravel the mechanisms by which anti-FimH antibodies may function
to prevent UTIs by directly blocking bladder binding and indirectly by interfering with UPEC GIT colonization.
These results will inform the rational targeting of the uropathogens that affect millions of people with rUTIs. In
addition, our approach enables the rapid generation of anti-UPEC human mAbs that can be used for therapeutics
and diagnostics."
10726564,"Pancreatitis is a potentially fatal disease of exocrine pancreas, with significant morbidity and
mortality, and a heavy burden on the US healthcare system. The disease is common in Veterans
patient population. Its mechanism remains obscure, and no specific or effective treatment is
available. Pancreatitis is not only associated with poor quality of life but is also a major risk factor
for the deadly pancreatic cancer. The pancreatic acinar cell is a major participant in both acute
and chronic pancreatitis. Its’ central physiologic function is to synthesize, transport, and secrete
digestive enzymes. This is accomplished through coordinated actions of mitochondria, which
provide energy (ATP); lysosomes and autophagy, mediating removal of damaged or dysfunctional
organelles; and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a site of enzyme synthesis and folding.
 Several years ago we put forward a novel concept that Dysfunction of the pancreatic acinar
cell organellar machinery mediating protein processing, trafficking, and degradation is
central to the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. Our studies (as well as by other groups)
have validated this hypothesis. These studies have been mostly performed within the framework
of an NIH/NIDDK Program Project on which I serve as PD/PI – the first ever Program grant on
pancreatitis, integrating the work of leading pancreatologists from 5 institutions across the US.
We showed that both experimental and human pancreatitis are associated with profound
disordering of acinar cell lysosomal, autophagy and mitochondrial pathways, and characterized
the underlying mechanisms. We further showed that genetic and pharmacologic modulations of
these pathways can ameliorate (or, conversely, cause) the disease.
 My current research provides further insight into these mechanisms. Studies supported by VA
Merit award investigate the role of autophagy in chronic pancreatitis by using a novel, clinically
relevant mouse model with pancreas-specific genetic insufficiency of the protein SPINK1
(mutations in which increase the risk of chronic pancreatitis in humans 20- to 40-fold). Studies
supported by NIH/NIAAA and DOD investigate the role of organelle disorders in pancreatitis
induced by environmental factors. The NIAAA-funded project examines the role of impaired
lysosomal/autophagy pathway in the inflammatory response of alcoholic pancreatitis, and
proposes new pharmacologic approaches. The DOD-funded project investigates the role of
mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) in pancreatitis induced by combined action of
alcohol and smoking, and analyzes the interrelations between mitochondrial dysfunction and ER
stress. We apply pharmacologic and genetic approaches to examine beneficial effects of MPTP
blockade in models of pancreatitis caused by alcohol and cigarette smoke. The focus of my most
recent studies is on elucidating the mechanisms linking organellar disfunction to pancreatitis
pathologies such as inflammation and cell death. We found, in particular, that
lysosomal/autophagy dysfunction causes profound dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism in
acinar cells, and that cholesterol-lowering drugs improve experimental pancreatitis. The findings
are described in a manuscript now under revision in The Journal of Clinical Investigation; and I
have submitted an R01 application to NIH to investigate the role of cholesterol dysregulation in
the inflammatory and cell death responses of pancreatitis.
 Our studies have greatly advanced the knowledge of molecular mechanisms mediating
pancreatitis, opened new research directions, and are recognized in the field as a paradigm shift."
10726565,"Myocardial injury is increased during ischemia and reperfusion in the aged heart and
accelerates the transition to post-infarction heart failure. Most therapeutic strategies that
effectively decrease cardiac injury in younger hearts fail in aged hearts. Aging causes
dysfunctional mitochondria that increase cardiac injury from ischemia and reperfusion. Aging
impairs the electron transport chain with decreased oxidative phosphorylation and increased
production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, it is a critical need to understand the mechanisms
by which age-induced metabolic defects lead to increased injury. We found that endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress increases during aging. We showed that treatment of aged mice with
intervention to decrease ER stress markedly improved mitochondrial function in aged hearts.
Following the improvement in baseline mitochondrial function, cardiac injury from a subsequent
episode of ischemia and reperfusion was markedly reduced.
 Complex I is a rate limiting step in the electron transport chain. We found that key protein
subunits of complex I are decreased by aging. Activity of the MITO localized protease calpain is
increased during aging. We hypothesize that ER stress activates mitochondria-localized
calpain causing depletion of subunits of complex I and impairment of complex I function
leading to age-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Aim 1 studies the mechanism of the ER
stress mediated injury to complex I via activation of mitochondrial calpain. Our ongoing work
showed that chronic metformin treatment reduced ER stress with improved mitochondrial
function in aged hearts. AMP protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin
(mTOR) are key effectors that respond to metabolic and cell stress. mTORC1 signaling
regulates protein synthesis and is linked to ER stress. mTORC2 regulates cell growth and
insulin signaling. We found evidence of increased mTORC1 activation in the aged heart with
downregulation of mTORC1 following metformin therapy. We hypothesize that metformin
decreases ER stress via AMPK-mediated downregulation of mTORC1.
 The resulting dysfunctional mitochondria need be removed by mitophagy, which is
decreased in the aged heart. AMPK and mTOR modulate mitophagy. In initial work, we found
that metformin treatment in the aged heart activates mitophagy through AMPK signaling.
Metformin treatment thus has the potential to both decrease ER stress mediated direct injury to
mitochondria via calpain activation and to facilitate the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria in
aged hearts. Aim 2 studies the mechanisms of the downregulation of ER stress by metformin
treatment via modulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling that impacts the ER stress
response gene program with the potential enhancement of mitophagy. Age-induced
mitochondrial dysfunction increases the susceptibility of the aged heart to injury from
subsequent ischemia and reperfusion. We hypothesize that restoration of mitochondrial
function with chronic metformin feeding will decrease cardiac injury in the aged hearts.
The contribution of restored mitochondrial function in the aged heart to decrease injury from
subsequent ischemia and reperfusion is studied in Aim 3. This proposal advances our
understanding of the mechanisms of ER stress-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction during aging
in the heart and provides guidance to develop clinically relevant approaches to decrease
cardiac injury by improving mitochondrial function in aged hearts."
10726612,"AKI is a major kidney disease that is associated with high mortality, morbidity, and increasing
prevalence. Moreover, incomplete or maladaptive kidney repair following AKI leads to chronic renal
pathologies, contributing to CKD. Aging population, mirrored by veterans, is highly susceptible to both
AKI and CKD. A key pathological feature of AKI is the damage of renal tubules and, accordingly, the
past research has focused on tubular cell injury and death. However, it is known that, in response to
injury, cells may activate intrinsic mechanisms or stress responses for self-protection and survival, and
the cells die only when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or altered by severe or prolonged insult.
Stress granule (SG) is a newly discovered, cytoplasmic structure formed in eukaryotic cells upon cell
stress, which mainly contains RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. We recently demonstrated the first
evidence of SG formation in stressed kidney tubular cells. We have now established the first mouse
model in which the core SG gene G3BP1 is specifically ablated from kidney proximal tubule cells. In
addition, we have identified CSDE1 as a novel binding protein of G3BP1. The goal of this application
is to determine the pathologic role of SG in ischemic AKI and maladaptive kidney repair, and elucidate
the molecular interaction between G3BP1 and CSDE1. We hypothesize that: Stress granules are
induced in ischemic AKI to protect kidney tubular cells, but persistent stress granules after AKI may
contribute to maladaptive repair. Through the interaction with G3BP1, CSDE1 plays an important role
in SG formation during cell stress in conditions like ischemic AKI. We propose three specific aims to:
(1) test the hypothesis that stress granules are induced in ischemic AKI to protect against renal tubular
damage; (2) test the hypothesis that stress granules contribute to maladaptive kidney repair after
ischemic AKI; and (3) test the hypothesis that CSDE1 plays an important role in stress granule
formation through the interaction with G3BP1. This application will unveil the role of stress granules in
AKI and post-AKI kidney repair, and elucidate G3BP1/CSDE1 interaction in stress granule formation.
As such, completion of the work will not only gain significant insights into the regulation of stress
granules, but may also identify stress granule as a novel therapeutic target for AKI and associated
CKD, opening a new field of study."
10726575,"Lung cancer remains the major cancer-related cause of death in the Western World and intense
efforts are directed toward the development of immunotherapy for the treatment of this disease.
While immunotherapy targeting cytotoxic T (CD8+ T) lymphocytes has been successful in several
malignancies, such as melanoma and prostate cancer, it has demonstrated only limited success
in lung cancer. Based on our laboratory’s work in lung transplantation, where we have
demonstrated a tolerogenic role for alloreactive CD8+ T cells, we have now generated preclinical
animal data which demonstrates that, unlike the case for other malignancies, the presence of
conventional CD8+ T cells can accelerate the growth of both transplantable as well as
carcinogen-induced lung cancer in a murine model. In this Merit Award application we propose
a series of coordinated but non-overlapping specific aims to delineate the tolerogenic role of CD8+
T cells in lung cancer, identify mechanisms responsible for CD8+ T cell-mediated downregulation
of the immune response, as well as define the interaction of CD8+ T cells with natural killer cells.
This proposal will extend our understanding of lung cancer-specific immunoregulation and
generate novel preclinical data that can be utilized for rational design of lung cancer- specific
novel therapeutic approaches for Veterans and the general population."
10726576,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Essential hypertension and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are devastating conditions for United States
Veterans. An estimated one-third of the world’s population suffers from hypertension despite a large number of
treatment options. SLE is a heterogeneous disease the treatment of which is limited to the use of non-specific
global immunosuppression. There is a lack of understanding of the mechanisms underlying these conditions.
Isolevuglandins (IsoLGs) are oxidation products of fatty acids that form as a result of reactive oxygen species.
These molecules adduct covalently to lysine residues of proteins. Adducted proteins are then presented as
autoantigens to T-cells resulting in immune cell activation and resultant hypertension and systemic autoimmunity.
Based upon previously published studies and preliminary data, it is clear that both essential hypertension and
SLE are initiated by this process of isoLG-adduct formation, processing, and immune cell activation. I have
discovered an important role of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 in the presentation of isoLG-adducted
autoantigens, the development of hypertension, and aortic inflammation in a mouse model of essential
hypertension. Additionally, in a mouse model of SLE, I have also discovered that treatment with an isoLG
scavenger, 2-hydroxybenzylamine, attenuates hypertension and systemic autoimmunity. Finally, I found that a
subset of patients with SLE exhibit isoLG accumulation within antigen presenting cells, suggesting a unique
clinical profile and potential therapeutic opportunities for these patients. I hypothesize that within antigen
presenting cells in both hypertension and SLE, isoLG adducts are processed and displayed by an
immunoproteasome dependent mechanism with a primary role of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7.
Additionally, patients with SLE that exhibit isoLG-adduct accumulation exhibit unique disease characteristics. My
specific aims are: (1) To determine a role of isoLG-adducts in SLE-associated hypertension and disease
heterogeneity. (2) To determine the role of immunoproteasome function in isoLG-adducted antigen presentation
and hypertension. (3) To determine the role of LMP7 function in immune activation, isoLG-adducted antigen
presentation, and hypertension in SLE. To accomplish these aims we will recruit SLE patients and obtain
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cells will be studied by flow cytometry for the presence of isoLG-adduct
accumulation within unique populations of antigen presenting cells. IsoLG-adduct levels will be compared with
clinical parameters to determine the parameters that correlate with adduct accumulation. To study the function
of the immunoproteasome, I will utilize mice globally deficient for the three subunits of the immunoproteasome
(TKO mice). I have also generated a conditional knockout of the chymotrypsin subunit of the immunoproteasome
(LMP7fl/fl) which will be crossed to CD11c-Cre transgenic animals to generate an antigen presenting cell specific
LMP7 deficient animal. These animals will be studied for the development of hypertension and inflammation in
the setting of two well established acquired models of essential hypertension in mice. To study the role of LMP7
in SLE, I propose to examine the effect of the LMP7 inhibitor PR-957 in the B6.SLE123 murine model of SLE.
Additionally, I will study the effect of dendritic cell specific LMP7 deletion in a model of chemically-induced SLE
by treating LMP7fl/fl/CD11c-Cre with pristane. Animals will be studied for the development of hypertension,
immune cell expansion, autoantibody production, and renal injury. Together, these studies hold the promise of
elucidating novel mechanistic insights into essential hypertension and SLE. Moreover, they will provide novel
therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of these conditions."
10890194,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sleep deficiency remains one of the most prominent and unaddressed public health concerns in pediatric
healthcare settings. Pediatric sleep disparities are prominent across minoritized racial subpopulations in the
dimensions of sleep duration, timing, alertness, behaviors, and quality/disorders. Despite the evidence of sleep
deficiency burdening minoritized youth, these susceptible subpopulations are underrecognized in the clinical
workflow leading to sleep medicine specialty services. Ignoring this underlying bias has yielded poorly defined
pediatric sleep cohorts in clinical contexts (e.g., historical overrepresentation of White patients). A computable
phenotype offers an efficient way to examine a large amount of data from many health systems, specifically
electronic health record (EHR) data. Developing a computable phenotype for pediatric sleep deficiency will help
us to target sleep screening and care where it is needed the most. However, to do this we will have to ensure
the computable phenotype is designed to capture traditionally missed groups and is not biased in a way which
harms historically marginalized subpopulations. This K01 will address these equity gaps by identifying potential
biases inherent in EHR datasets, understanding their causes, and mitigating them using rigorous methods. The
proposed K01 award will allow me to conduct the following aims: 1) the development and validation of a
computable phenotype algorithm for classifying pediatric sleep deficiency; and 2) application of postprocessing
bias mitigation methods to build and test an equitable computable phenotype model. My primary goal is to
become an independent investigator focused on detecting pediatric sleep deficiency and translating that
knowledge into effective strategies to improve sleep health in underserved communities. Achieving this goal
requires training and research mentorship in specific content areas to (1) learn advanced biomedical informatics
approaches for leveraging EHR (e.g., computable phenotyping) and develop an automated screening tool for
use by pediatric health systems, (2) develop expertise in population-level sleep disparities research and SDH
measurement, and (3) employ responsible conduct of research skills in developing unbiased artificial intelligence
(AI) and applying machine learning. My proposed research and training plan will equip me with the skills
necessary to become an independent investigator in pediatric sleep research and population health science,
prepared to work in interdisciplinary clinical and technical teams. An exceptional interdisciplinary team has been
assembled to complete the aims of this K01 research, as well as to mentor me in the training areas critical to my
long-term career development. My K01 mentorship team includes both mid-career (Drs. Azizi Seixas, Jennifer
Cooper, Christopher Bartlett) and senior mentors/collaborators (Drs. Deena Chisolm, Hongfang Lui, Kelly
Kelleher, Lauren Hale), ensuring that I have access to researchers utilizing the latest cutting-edge methods, as
well as mentors with large collaborative networks and resources to help launch my career."
10930867,"Project Summary/Abstract
The world we knew prior to the COVID-19 pandemic is unlikely ever to return. Structural and behavioral
changes, such as remote working, socialization, and learning, are now part of everyday life. Telehealth has
emerged as a solution for health care delivery, and social connections have been maintained through Zoom,
Teams, and other software applications. These are good solutions for the general population, but people with
hand spasticity may not be able to use electronic devices without assistance. Spasticity, a sequela of some
neurological conditions, causes tight muscles, interferes with functional movements, affects activities of daily
living (ADLs), and increases caregiver burden. Moderate to high levels of spasticity cause loss of
independence and even institutionalization. The goal of spasticity care is to achieve optimal independence in
all aspects of life, with the assistance of others and aid of technology only as needed; however, the degree to
which individuals with moderate to high levels of hand spasticity can access and draw upon technology to
maintain their independence is unknown. Therefore, this application responds to the notice of special interest
to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on people with hand spasticity and identify current rehabilitation needs
to inform future interventions. The long-term goal of this research is to support optimal independence for
people with spasticity and good quality of life. The rationale for this exploratory sequential mixed-method study,
which is guided by the socio-ecological model, is to determine the impact of telehealth access on the receipt of
health care and the ability of adults with hand spasticity to maintain independence. Specific aims are to:
Aim 1. Identify access to health care and telehealth for adults with moderate to high levels of hand spasticity in
the community.
Aim 2: Identify computer literacy and barriers and facilitators to accessing telehealth for adults living with
moderate to high levels of hand spasticity in the community.
Aim 3: Identify the extent to which telehealth access and computer literacy affect independence for adults
living with moderate to high level of spasticity in the community.
Approach. Thirty adults with moderate to high levels of hand spasticity living in the community will be
recruited. NIH and PROMIS tools will assess Coronavirus Impact, access to technology, upper dexterity,
physical functioning, ADLs and Instrumental ADLs, psychological impact, loneliness, and social and emotional
health. Using the Coronavirus Impact and access to technology tools, we will first quantify the effect of the
pandemic on health care, telehealth, and independence. Then we will conduct 45- to 60-minute semi-
structured interviews that will offer greater insight into telehealth literacy, its barriers and facilitators, and its
impact on maintaining independence. This study is significant because it pinpoints unaddressed Covid-related
experiences and concerns affecting the ability of this population to maintain independence."
10933441,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Inter-organellar communication is an essential process for cellular function. Inside the cell, organelles can
interact through specialized microdomains called membrane contact sites (MCSs). These structures mediate the
close apposition of two organellar membranes, allowing the exchange of metabolites. In doing so, MCSs are
crucial for cellular homeostasis and metabolic plasticity. However, most of what is known about MCSs comes
only from a handful of well-studied metazoans, particularly yeast and mammals. Studying the function and
composition of MCSs in other eukaryotes—particularly in divergent lineages possessing phylum-specific
organelles—is therefore crucial to gain insights into the mechanisms requiring an independent solution to inter-
organellar communication.
My group seeks to understand inter-organellar communication in apicomplexans, are a group of parasitic protists
that include the causative agents of malaria and toxoplasmosis. In their complex life cycles, many of these
organisms transition through a variety of environments as they enter and exit cells in different host species. The
ability to propagate within a wide range of cell types relies on the capacity to access nutrients from diverse and
changing environments, which underscores the metabolic plasticity of apicomplexans. Most apicomplexans
possess a single mitochondrion and an apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid that arose from a secondary
endosymbiotic event at least 600 million years ago. Both organelles have been coevolving ever since, and now
play crucial roles in the metabolic plasticity and survival of these parasites. Although a close physical interaction
between the mitochondrion and the apicoplast has been observed, the molecular identity of this interaction
remains elusive.
Using the model apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii, my laboratory aims to identify the molecular effectors
mediating the mitochondrion-apicoplast interaction using two different, yet complementary approaches:
proximity biotinylation and bimolecular complementation. As the apicoplast is an apicomplexan-specific
organelle, the identification of proteins involved in mitochondrion-apicoplast MCSs could provide opportunities
for the design of anti-parasitic therapies against these pathogens. Our work will open new scientific venues of
apicomplexan biology, and yield insight into the evolution and organellar crosstalk in these organisms."
10923969,"ABSTRACT. Heart failure (HF) affects 6.2 million people in the US, costs $30 billion dollars per year, and
results in 1 million hospitalizations per year. Readmission within 30 days occurs in 25% of Medicare
beneficiaries hospitalized for HF, and previous interventions to reduce readmissions have had limited success.
One of the most promising strategies to reduce readmissions and improve outcomes in HF is through home
health care (HHC), which is delivered by Medicare certified HHC agencies, and provides skilled nurse home
visits to monitor and manage patients during the post-acute period. Annually, 34% of Medicare beneficiaries
hospitalized for HF receive HHC. Our prior AHRQ-funded national, observational, comparative effectiveness
study (R01HS020257) found that HF patients had an 8% lower 30-day readmission rate (40% relative
reduction) when they received two evidence-based practices: a) early and intensive HHC nurse visits (defined
as a first HHC nursing visit within 2 days of hospital discharge with a total of three or more nursing visits within
the first week) and b) an outpatient medical visit within the first week of discharge, compared to those who did
not receive this timely follow-up. However, nationwide, only 12% of Medicare beneficiaries receive this early
visit protocol, representing a major implementation gap. To advance the science and improve outcomes in HF,
we will test an intervention called Improving TRansitions ANd OutcomeS for Heart FailurE Patients in Home
Health CaRe (I-TRANSFER-HF), comprised of early and intensive HHC nurse visits and an outpatient visit
within 7 days of discharge. Using a Hybrid Type 1, stepped wedge randomized trial design, we will test the
effectiveness and implementation of I-TRANSFER-HF in partnership with 4 geographically diverse dyads of
hospitals and HHC agencies (“hospital-HHC agency” dyads) across the US. Aim 1 will test the effectiveness of
I-TRANSFER-HF to reduce 30-day readmissions (primary outcome) and ED visits (secondary outcome) and
increase days at home (secondary outcome) among HF patients who receive timely follow-up compared to
usual care. Hospital-HHC agency dyads will be randomized to cross over from a baseline period of no
intervention to the intervention at different points in time. Medicare claims data from each dyad will be used to
ascertain outcomes; these data will be supplemented with national claims data for external controls not in the
trial, weighted to produce covariate balance. Hypotheses will be tested with generalized mixed models. Aim 2
will assess the determinants of I-TRANSFER-HF’s implementation using a multi-method approach and guided
by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Qualitative interviews will be conducted
with key stakeholders across the hospital-HHC agency dyads to assess acceptability, barriers, and facilitators
of implementation; feasibility and process measures will be assessed with Medicare claims data. As the first
pragmatic trial of HHC in HF, this study has the potential to dramatically improve care and outcomes for HF
patients and produce novel insights for the dissemination and implementation of HHC nationally."

Biological sex is a clear factor in an individual’s ability to repair and regenerate tissue. Females are at higher
risk for soft tissue injuries compared to age-matched males and exhibit higher rates of degenerative diseases
such as osteoporosis, sarcopenia, osteoarthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome. One common hallmark of these
degenerative diseases is the disruption in homeostasis of the extracellular matrix (ECM). A delicate balance in
tissue production and breakdown is essential to healthy function in every single tissue. Production of too much
matrix can lead to fibrosis, while excessive matrix breakdown results in weakened tissue function. However,
the role that biological sex plays in the processes of ECM homeostasis are currently unknown. A fundamental
understanding of sex-based differences in tissue remodeling, and the regulation of this process by sex
hormone signaling, will be critical to understanding divergence in injury and disease and establishing patient-
specific regenerative strategies. The overall goal of our research program is to understand how
biological sex regulates the process of ECM remodeling, from initial mechanotransduction to signal
processing to ECM synthesis. Theme 1: Do male and female cells sense their local mechanical environment
differently? There is evidence in many tissues that ECM structure, organization, and resulting function differs
between age-matched males and females. However, the effect this has on cell biology is currently unknown.
Custom-built and commercially available bioreactors will be used to identify differences in the sensing and cell-
level responses to mechanical stimuli based on biological sex alone (isolated cells) and the local environment
(explant tissue and engineered microenvironments). Theme 2: Is the balance of matrix production and
breakdown altered by biological sex? Since degenerative diseases rely on a disruption of the balance between
synthesis and degradation, a broad-spectrum approach to understanding ECM remodeling is necessary. Using
an established model of mechanically-driven ECM remodeling, we can assess synthesis of ECM molecules
and ECM-degrading enzymes, as well as detect products of ECM breakdown in real time. These techniques
will allow for a whole picture of ECM turnover in real time. Theme 3: How does the presence of sex hormones
affect cell signaling pathways associated with ECM remodeling? Dramatic changes in ECM structure during
pregnancy clearly point to a substantial role for hormone signaling in ECM remodeling, and studies
demonstrate a significant role for estrogen signaling in musculoskeletal and cardiac tissues. Using custom-
designed fluid exchange bioreactors, we will have precise control over the concentration and duration of sex
hormones exposure as well as the local mechanical environment simultaneously, allowing us to study the
effect of estrogen and progesterone signaling in different phases of the remodeling process. These studies will
enable a fundamental understanding of the contribution of biological sex to tissue repair capacity and pave the
way for our novel in vitro tools to identify new targets for the development of patient-specific therapeutics."

Magnetic resonance imaging-guided adaptive radiotherapy (MRgART) allows for safer treatment of otherwise
difficult-to-treat soft-tissue cancers in the abdomen, such as inoperable pancreatic cancers that occur close to
highly mobile and radiosensitive gastrointestinal (GI) organs. MRgART enables daily replanning to compensate
for organ shape variations through improved visualization of the tumor and nearby organs. However, nearby
abdominal organs move considerably between and during treatment fractions and, crucially, accurate tracking
of the dose distribution accumulated in those tissues is currently unavailable. Consequently, tumor prescription
coverage is still often constrained to sub-optimal levels by design to conservatively reduce the risk of radiation
toxicity to GI organs. We hypothesize that accurate estimates of doses to the surrounding mobile healthy organs,
accumulated over all fractions, would enable a less conservative and more effective treatment of the full extent
of the disease. Hence, the key clinical need we will address, to ensure improved local control and to reduce rates
of local tumor progression and morbidity, particularly in the tumors adjacent to luminal GI organs, is the
development of reliably accurate deformable image registration (DIR) methods to estimate the spatial dose
accumulated to the mobile GI luminal organs throughout treatment from previous fractions. This proposal
addresses the key need by developing, rigorously validating, and systematically measuring the gain in target
coverage with an innovative deep learning DIR dose accumulation utilizing a cohort of virtual digital twins. In
Aim 1, We will develop patient-specific virtual digital twin cohorts modeling 21 different temporally varying
realistic GI motions encompassing respiratory and digestive motion. The twins will combine analytical modeling
with the widely used XCAT digital phantoms. In Aim 2, the virtual digital twins will be used to optimize and
rigorously validate our innovative progressive registration-segmentation deep learning network for GI organs.
The key technical novelty of this approach is its ability to perform spatio-temporally varying regularization to
model large deformations, not possible with most DIR methods. In Aim 3, the potential clinical gain of using AI-
DIR dose accumulation compared with the clinical standard with conservative limits to the high dose region will
be systematically simulated with a variety of GI tract motion using the VDT datasets. Potential impact: The
developed and validated AI-DIR techniques, validated for realistic physiologic GI motions, will be applicable
beyond pancreatic tumors and will apply to other GI soft-tissue cancers. Ultimately, the availability of well-
validated dose accumulation techniques could enable clinicians to quantitatively determine the accumulated
radiation dose distribution to luminal GI organs and appropriately account for the spillover radiation, thus leading
to more personalized, safer, and possibly more effective radiation treatments."
10901963,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of malignancy and potential source of therapeutic targets. Recent work
indicates that metabolic liabilities change as cancer progresses, meaning that the pathways most relevant to
advanced cancers may not be apparent in locally-invasive, treatment-naïve tumors at the site of origin.
Recognizing the dearth of direct information about human cancer metabolism, we developed an approach to
probe the metabolic network of intact human tumors by infusing patients with stable isotope-labeled nutrients
(e.g. 13C-glucose) during tumor resection or biopsy. By measuring isotope labeling in metabolites extracted from
tumor samples and following the outcomes of patients who underwent this procedure, we identified metabolic
properties associated with poor survival. Of hundreds of metabolic features, 13C labeling in tricarboxylic acid
(TCA) cycle metabolites was the most predictive of cancer progression and early death. In non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), patients whose tumors have high labeling of these metabolites succumb much earlier than
patients with low labeling, and blocking this pathway in mouse models of NSCLC suppresses metastasis. In
clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), TCA cycle labeling is low when tumors are localized to the kidney but
much higher in metastatic tumors, and activating the TCA cycle promotes metastasis in mice. Therefore, in both
kinds of cancer, data from patients lead us to conclude that oxidative mitochondrial metabolism, particularly the
TCA cycle, electron transport chain (ETC) and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), promote cancer progression.
The success of these experiments prompts us to further study the metabolic basis of human cancer progression
in the hopes of developing new insights and therapies. We propose three general directions. First, using a
combination of approaches in humans and mice, we will thoroughly examine how mitochondrial metabolism
stimulates metastasis to identify discrete metabolic dependencies that could be safely targeted in patients.
Second, we will develop approaches to discover new metabolic liabilities in human tumors. Strategies include a
pipeline to probe viable tumor explants with a series of isotope-labeled nutrients under physiological conditions
to choose the most informative tracers for isotope infusions in patients; and dynamic imaging methods to observe
and quantify informative aspects of metabolic flux in tumors in real time. Third, we will use the orthogonal
approach of studying human inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) to discover why some metabolic anomalies
prime cells to become malignant. This approach capitalizes on a clinical cohort of over 1,000 subjects, including
patients with IEMs associated with highly penetrant cancers, and will provide unique insights into cancer initiation
and progression. Altogether these efforts will build on our long-standing productivity in human cancer metabolism
by uncovering new mechanisms governing the metabolic basis of cancer progression and producing new
methodologies to understand and treat lethal malignancies."

Hispanics/Latinos (HL) and African Americans (AA) represent a rapidly growing proportion of the United States
population (18.7% HL, 12.4% AA - US 2020 Census) who remain critically underrepresented in research of
Alzheimer disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD), despite a 1.5-2-fold higher prevalence of dementia
(vs non-Hispanic-white Americans). Underrepresentation in AD/ADRD research exacerbates health disparities
and challenges the development and implementation of efficacious and safe risk-reduction strategies for
AD/ADRD in HL/AA. Genetics do not fully explain disparate AD/ADRD risk, highlighting a fundamental
knowledge gap concerning how genomic factors interact with comorbidities and lifespan exposures to
Structural/Social Determinants of Health (SDoH; the “exposome”) to inform AD/ADRD risk. There is a critical
need to identify clinical, SDoH, and biological factors that contribute to disparate risk in HL/AA; establish the
relationship between exposures underlying AD/ADRD outcomes; use this information to mitigate disparities in
AD/ADRD burden through education and risk factor modification; and broadly disseminate this information to
inform the development of effective biomarkers and therapies. The Mayo Advancing Research Equity in ADRD
Study in Jacksonville (MAREAS-JAX; Spanish for tides) will address this need. Aim 1 will advance recruitment
of HL/AA cohorts (UH2) by developing/deploying outreach, recruitment, and engagement best practices for
HL/AA in Jacksonville, Florida, through a bilingual (English-Spanish) research team, supported by community
ambassador teams (CAT) and an external advisory committee (EAC) including experts in SDoH and AD/ADRD
research. Aim 2 will identify relevant measures of AD/ADRD burden (UH2►UH3). SDoH, cognitive, clinical, and
blood-based biomarker measures associated with cerebrovascular, amyloid, and tau burden, will be collected
through comprehensive/culturally appropriate annual assessments and integrated with multi-omics data,
structural (MR) and molecular (amyloid and tau) PET neuroimaging obtained at study entry, and every 2 years
thereafter to identify modifiable dementia risk factors, blood-based biomarkers, and molecular signatures of
AD/ADRD burden. Data collection will be standardized with input from EAC members to optimize scalability and
promote sample/data sharing. Aim 3 will provide meaningful individualized feedback (UH3) to participants
through a Brain Health Report detailing actionable risk factors and recommendations to mitigate intraindividual
AD/ADRD burden. Aim 4 will use multi-omics measures to identify molecular targets and signatures that interact
with the exposome and associate with AD/ADRD burden in HL/AA (UH3) using a systems biology approach with
validated analytic pipelines and prioritizing broad data sharing following NIH’s findability, accessibility,
interoperability, and reusability guidelines. In this way, MAREAS-Jax will chart the currents that drive
disproportionate participation in AD/ADRD research and disparate AD/ADRD burden and will inform the design
and implementation of strategies to shift these tides in Northeast Florida and beyond."
10929436,"Background: Approximately 40% of Veterans have obesity. Intensive weight management
programs such as MOVE! promote clinically significant weight loss, but only 3-7% of eligible
Veterans attend. Low enrollment and high attrition are due to obstacles such as travel, cost, and
motivation. Developed through over 20 years of research, Mental Contrasting with
Implementation Intentions (MCII) is a novel, evidence-based intervention to increase motivation
and behavior change. MCII has been shown to increase physical activity and consumption of
fruits and vegetables and promote weight loss, and we recently demonstrated that MCII is
feasible and acceptable to Veterans for weight management. However, has not been tested
adequately within primary care nor demonstrated weight loss in Veterans. We propose to
evaluate the efficacy and implementation of MCII for behavior change and weight loss in
Veterans within primary care when combined with the VA MOVE! Program.
Significance/Impact: This proposal aligns with the VA HSRD “primary care practice and
management of complex chronic diseases” funding priority. Primary care providers and PACT
members do not provide sufficient counseling to increase engagement with the MOVE!
Program. MCII can be taught by lay educators and can be delivered in conjunction with MOVE!
and other weight management treatments.
Innovation: MCII is innovative in its use of imagery, ease of delivery by lay educators, novel
mechanisms of action (via non-conscious motivational and cognitive processes), and ability to
be combined with other programs. Veterans can practice MCII on their own in under 10 minutes.
MCII uses a standardized, 4-step imagery procedure called WOOP that can be taught in 30
minutes. Veterans can then continue to use WOOP regularly, with the assistance of a WOOP
App and website containing video-, audio-, and paper-based tools. This study will be the first
randomized controlled trial of MCII within primary care and the first RCT to test the efficacy and
implementation of MCII for weight management when combined with MOVE! in Veterans.
Specific Aims: 1. Compare the impact of MCII + MOVE! vs. MOVE! alone on percent weight
change and waist circumference at 6 and 12 months. 2. Compare the impact of MCII + MOVE!
vs. MOVE! alone on MOVE! attendance, physical activity, and healthy eating at 6 and 12
months. 3. Evaluate implementation of MCII. We will use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework7,8 to evaluate implementation barriers,
facilitators, and outcomes of MCII.
Methodology: We will randomize 366 Veterans within primary care to either MCII + telephone-
delivered MOVE! (intervention) vs. telephone-delivered MOVE! alone (control) at the Manhattan
VA. At 6 and 12 months, participants will return to the clinic for a study visit where weight, diet,
and physical activity will be assessed in both groups. We will use intention-to-treat analyses.
Implementation/Next Steps: MCII is designed to be easily implemented in a variety of settings
and for a variety of behaviors. Freely available online training materials will facilitate
implementation. To guide future implementation and policy change, we will present data from
our Aim 3 implementation analyses and obtain input from Veteran stakeholders as well as local
VA and NCP leaders. If found to be efficacious, we will conduct hybrid
effectiveness/implementation studies of MCII in a multi-site study."

Alcohol-associated liver and pancreatic diseases (ALPD) and cirrhosis constitute leading metabolic diseases
caused by alcohol use disorder around the globe. The Southern California Research Center for ALPD and
Cirrhosis unifies 60 investigators from six academic institutions in Southern California to pursue a common
mission of being a leader in research, training, outreach, and treatment for the diseases. The center, since its
inception in 1999, has devoted its efforts for development and use of clinically relevant animal models to gain
novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of ALPD and cirrhosis. These efforts culminated to
groundbreaking discoveries and new therapeutic developments for the diseases such as a phage cocktail to
treat alcohol-associated hepatitis patients with cytolysin-positive E. faecalis, anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody
for patients with alcohol-associated liver disease, and Simvastatin for treatment of recurrent acute pancreatitis.
The center’s interactive infrastructure and environment have facilitated in the past 5 years: a 134% increase
in research base to $21.6M/year; 11 new U01/P01/MPI-R01 programs and 3 DOD program projects; 241
publications; 8 NIH/DOD-funded early-stage investigators; 14 postdocs transitioned to faculty positions at US
universities; 99 graduate students taught and 44 students undergone the Lee Summer Research Fellowship;
and 4 workshop/community seminars and 4 international symposia organized. As a unique national resource,
the center has supported 15 non-center investigators via provision of 383 model mice and 333 biospecimens
by the Animal Core, facilitating their 13 grant acquisitions and applications. We further consolidated the
regional repository resources to advance our ALPD translational and clinical studies in pursuit for novel
therapeutic modalities.
The center will continue to strive as a unique national scientific center of excellence in ALPD and cirrhosis by:
1) maximizing our interactive and synergistic science for a pursuit for the center’s main goal of identification
of therapeutic targets for advanced ALPD and cirrhosis;
2) serving as a national and international resource in our fields of research via provision of unique models,
technology, expertise, and collaborative opportunities with outside NIAAA-funded scientists;
3) providing comprehensive education and training at the multi-levels ranging from undergraduate and
graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, to junior scientists and faculty to foster and support future
generations of independent scientists in the ALPD and cirrhosis field; and
4) continuing outreach efforts to disseminate the center’s new findings to lay public, healthcare workers, and
scientists in our home and global communities."
10912777,"Project Summary
Peroxisomes are ubiquitous, dynamic organelles with almost exclusive roles in lipid metabolism, yet their role in
regulating organismal metabolism and aging is poorly understood. Furthermore, even little is known about the
specific mechanisms regulating appropriate peroxisomal remodeling and metabolism. I have recently identified
that during states of increased lipid oxidation, specifically fasting, peroxisomes acutely remodel their shape and
alter their function to allow for acute-metabolic adaptation. Notably, this ability to remodel both peroxisomal form
and function is linked to longevity during intermittent fasting (IF) and dietary restriction (DR), both of which require
altered lipid metabolism. Together these data suggest that peroxisomes play a critical yet understudied role in
longevity-associated metabolic adaptation. Therefore, my central hypothesis is that the ability to remodel
peroxisomal dynamics and function in response to fasting is a key determinant of metabolic flexibility and
longevity. Thus, using fasting as a central mechanism inducing increased lipid oxidation, I have focused on the
role peroxisomes play in fasting adaptation and longevity. In Aim 1, I will investigate mechanistically why
peroxisomes dynamically remodel during fasting and whether this ability increases cellular lipid oxidation
efficiency. In Aim 2, I will define the functional role of peroxisomal protein import in regulating peroxisomal fatty
acid oxidation (FAO) during fasting to increase metabolic flexibility. Finally, in the R00 phase, I aim to develop
an independent research program investigating the regulation of peroxisome metabolism and signaling, their
role in DR-longevity, with a specific emphasis on identifying novel targets that restore age-related dysregulation
of lipid oxidation via restoring peroxisomal function. Thus, knowledge generated from this proposal will likely
provide fundamental information on peroxisomes as central organelles with increasing relevance to organismal
metabolism and aging and likely reframe our understanding of how age-related changes in lipid metabolism can
be therapeutically targeted via modulation peroxisomal dynamics and metabolism."
10913575,"Global life expectancy is rising, and 16% of the world’s population – up to 25% in North America – is predicted to be at least 65 years of age by 2050. Aging societies are exposed to increasing emergence of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD). Identifying individuals at risk using new markers of pathophysiological changes will become a key challenge of 21st century medicine to enable prevention and early intervention. Establishing normative ranges of these markers across the lifespan is imperative for early diagnostics and to improve our understanding of healthy aging and AD mechanisms.
Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a non-invasive in-vivo method quantifying signals from endogenous metabolites, lipids and macromolecules (MM). MRS signal amplitudes are determined by the concentrations and MR relaxation times of these compounds, i.e. indicators of local biochemistry and cellular microstructure, respectively. Unfortunately, subject-specific metabolite relaxation and MM estimation is prohibitively time-consuming with conventional MRS methods, and researchers are forced to use averaged literature values and assumptions instead. This practice is highly problematic as changes in metabolite levels, relaxation times and the MM background reflect different biological processes that evolve independently across the lifespan, but cannot be distinguished using conventional MRS (e.g., signal decreases with age could reflect lower metabolite levels or shorter transverse relaxation times). Current MRS methods therefore have substantially diminished interpretability in healthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as ADRD. This research proposal will address this critical knowledge gap by developing novel MRS methods allowing simultaneous subject-specific metabolite concentration, relaxation time, and MM background estimation. By separating those three candidate biomarkers, a comprehensive profile of local neurochemistry and cellular microstructure with greater specificity than previously possible can be achieved. Application in a cohort of healthy volunteers between 20 and 80 years of age will establish age trajectories of the candidate biomarkers in normal aging.
Developing these novel techniques requires substantial expertise both in MR sequence development and in data analysis. This proposal builds upon my exceptional record in developing our open-source MRS software package Osprey with new training in pulse sequence development from world-leading experts in the field.
The Johns Hopkins University provides outstanding career development resources and training from world-renowned experts necessary to successfully mentor me in the field of MRS, pulse programming, and clinical research design in aging and AD/ADRD cohorts. This project will develop novel techniques to characterize important neurobiological processes and their role in healthy aging, laying the foundation to identify new early biomarkers of AD/ADRD."
10756172,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite the ubiquitous role of fibrosis in tissue dysfunction arising from aging and disease, no
representative in vitro model of the fibrotic microenvironment exists. Fibrosis is characterized by excess
extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition that stiffens the cellular microenvironment. Therefore, to model fibrosis in
vitro, cell culture substrates that permit quantitative, dynamic tuning of matrix mechanics and composition are
necessary. However, existing dynamic hydrogel culture platforms generally rely on chemistries that may be
toxic to cells or that simultaneously change multiple parameters, making it difficult to assign causal
relationships between altered matrix properties and cell fate changes. Fibrotic stiffening occurs in a wide range
of tissues, including skeletal muscle. Along with increased fibrosis, the regenerative function of skeletal muscle
decreases with aging. Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are responsible for maintaining and repairing muscle
throughout life and are known to be acutely mechanosensitive, losing their stem cell potential when cultured on
stiff substrates. Thus, the stiffened, fibrotic microenvironment may contribute to the diminished regenerative
capacity of aged MuSCs. The goal of this project is to develop an in vitro model of tissue fibrosis based on
dynamic hydrogel biomaterials and to employ this model to identify molecular mechanisms of MuSC
mechanosensing that are implicated in MuSC dysfunction in aging. The mentored phase of this proposal will
provide advanced technical training in aging biology, transgenic mouse models, cellular traction force
measurement, and machine learning approaches for bioinformatics. This training will enable an independent
research program leveraging dynamic biomaterials to deconvolve the complex interactions of mechanical
forces, matrix biochemistry, and cell-cell signaling that dictate the progression of aging and disease. Additional
structured training in scientific writing, grantsmanship, and research management will facilitate the transition to
independence, supported by a committee of faculty from the Stanford Schools of Medicine and Engineering.
 Aim 1 will optimize a synthetic hydrogel system that uses near-infrared light and bioorthogonal reactions to
dynamically stiffen the gels, mimicking fibrosis. These hydrogels will be used to elucidate mechanisms of
mechanosensing in MuSCs, using FRET-based force sensors and transgenic mouse models. Aim 2 will model
muscle aging in vitro, using dynamically stiffening gels modified with ECM components characteristic of aging.
Single cell RNA sequencing and machine learning bioinformatics approaches will identify unique mechanically
regulated drivers of cell fate that reduce MuSC regenerative potential in aging. Aim 3 will develop novel
materials for 3D cell culture with dynamic tuning of viscoelastic properties to establish the first human model of
muscle “aging in a dish.” This project stands to identify new therapeutic targets to improve muscle function with
aging and to develop engineered platforms to study numerous heritable diseases and aging in diverse tissues."
10892872,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Turner syndrome (TS) is a common genetic disorder caused by X chromosome (Xchr) abnormalities. Women
with TS have a four-fold higher risk of developing diabetes mellitus (DM) than the general population, and DM
contributes significantly to mortality. Despite the prevalence of DM in TS, the underlying mechanism(s) and
specific Xchr contributions driving diabetes risk remain elusive. As such, there are no specific preventative
strategies or treatments for DM in TS. The objective of the proposed project is to unravel the genetic and
physiologic mechanism(s) that lead to hyperglycemia in TS, using glycemic phenotyping in the context of Xchr
gene dosage, Xchr parent-of-origin, and genomic and epigenetic techniques. My central hypotheses are that
TS-associated hyperglycemia is a consequence of altered Xchr gene dosage (e.g., by Xchr imprinting and/or
structural Xchr variation) and that this contributes to a TS-specific phenotype of progressive beta cell functional
impairments first detectable only in response to oral glucose but not mixed macronutrients. To test these
hypotheses, we propose the following aims: (1) Identify Xchr contributions to the TS hyperglycemia phenotype
and (2) Determine if beta cell function is impaired in response to mixed macronutrients in TS. We will perform
multivariable analysis of data from National Institute of Child Health and Human Development’s Data and
Specimen Hub, which includes frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance tests (fsOGTT) and Xchr parent-of-
origin for 84 individuals with TS to determine if an Xchr parent-of-origin effect exists with respect to categorical
glycemia. Additionally, we will enroll 30 individuals with TS to undergo long-read Xchr sequencing in conjunction
with RNA sequencing. This will allow identification of candidate imprinted Xchr genes. This project also includes
paired fsOGTT and mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTT) for 20 individuals with TS and 10 age-, sex-, and BMI-
matched controls to further elucidate TS-specific impairments in beta cell function. Completion of the proposed
project will add to understanding of Xchr contributions to the TS hyperglycemia phenotype and contribute toward
identification of drug targets and/or new disease managements strategies. The project is also a vehicle for me
to achieve my career goals and objectives by providing me with expertise in glycemic phenotyping, genomic
and epigenetic techniques, multivariable statistics, and multisite study design and execution. The proposed
integrated research, mentorship, and didactic training program combined with the collaborative research
environment at the University of Iowa and off-site collaboration with faculty at the University of Minnesota and
Indiana University will foster my long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator leading a
translational research program focused on isolating genomic and epigenetic contributions to diabetes risk."
10918288,"GPCRs are the largest family of mammalian membrane receptors with an established relevance in therapy,
representing a third of the currently FDA-approved drugs. Particularly GsPCRs via cAMP are involved in many
physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Classically considered to originate solely from the plasma
membrane, this view was recently challenged by observations showing that GsPCRs, upon internalization, can
sustain cAMP signaling from intracellular compartments. Most importantly, this second endocytic cAMP phase
was strictly associated with nuclear transcriptional events responsible for the generation of specific biological
responses, like chronic inflammation, chronic pain, and migraine, conditions that affect millions worldwide.
However, the molecular mechanisms involved in sustained signaling are still unknown. Their characterization
should deepen our understanding of the GPCRs’ spatiotemporal organization and function and may provide
novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. We have identified a novel GαS-independent CAP1-Rap1-AC9
regulatory unit and its potential involvement in sustained signaling will be addressed in this proposal.
The scientific premise for this proposal is based on the identification of a novel GαS-independent CAP1-Rap1
complex directly regulating AC9. Utilizing novel optogenetic actuators and targeting strategies, we will test the
hypothesis that upon the first plasma membrane-generated GαS-dependent cAMP wave, this new intracellular
GαS-independent CAP1-Rap1-AC9 regulatory unit is responsible for the sustained cAMP phase.
Four integrated specific aims are proposed to experimentally test this hypothesis. In SA #1 we will characterize
AC9 as the CAP1-Rap1-sensitive tmAC isoform involved in the potentiation of cAMP dynamics in cells. In SA #2
we will identify and characterize key residues in AC9 that discriminate GαS and Rap1 binding. In SA #3, we will
use the ALFA-tag targeting strategy to bring sensors (AC9-ALFA/Nb-ALFA-H188) close to AC9 to test the
hypothesis that the AC9-CAP1-Rap1 ternary complex establishes a compartmentalized positive feedback loop
responsible for the GPCR sustained cAMP wave. Finally, in SA #4, we will use GαS- and Rap1-targeted
disruptors to uncouple functional GαS- and Rap1-dependent cyclase activation events in the plasma membrane
and intracellular AC9 compartments.
Our laboratory’s long-standing interest is to understand the spatiotemporal regulation of cAMP-dependent
signaling events. A multidisciplinary approach combining biochemistry, optogenetics, and nanobody-targeted
strategies will be exploited to test the role of AC9-CAP1-Rap1 in compartmentalized cAMP signaling.
Successful completion of the proposed studies should provide new insights into the mechanism/s cells utilize
to compute (code/decode) the relay of the cAMP signal (i.e., fidelity, specificity, efficiency) and provide us
opportunities in the identification of new subcellular localized targets for pharmacological intervention of this
critical second messenger pathway."
10843926,"Androgen deprivation remains the standard systemic treatment for prostate cancer (PCa) that has spread
beyond the prostate, but most patients progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Many of these tumors will respond to abiraterone or to second generation AR antagonists, but resistance
inevitably develops. Some patients at this stage may respond to taxanes or to PARP inhibitors, but options for
the majority of patients are limited. Increased Wnt signaling is one of the mechanisms that has been implicated
in the progression to ASI resistance. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is initiated when a Wnt ligand binds
to a Frizzled family receptor, which results in increased β-catenin and coactivation of TCF family transcription
factors. A subset of Wnts can preferentially activate noncanonical Wnt pathways through receptors including
ROR1 and ROR2. The downstream signaling pathways are less well-defined and are context dependent, but
include the planar cell polarity and Wnt-Ca++ pathways. Notably, noncanonical Wnt signaling has also been
reported to inhibit the tumor suppressive Hippo pathway, thereby enhancing the nuclear expression of YAP1 and
TAZ, with subsequent stimulation of the TEAD-family transcription factors. Wnt5a is the predominant
noncanonical Wnt whose expression is often dysregulated in cancer, and it has been implicated in both tumor-
suppressive and tumor-promoting activities. In PCa, increased Wnt5a expression has been associated with
mCRPC and with neuroendocrine PCa, but has also been associated with better prognosis in localized PCa,
and with growth suppression and dormancy. While these studies indicate that noncanonical Wnt signaling can
have growth suppressive as well as stimulatory effects, the downstream signals mediating these effects remain
to be established. We have found that the growth suppressive effects of Wnt5a in PCa are mediated through
ROR2, and that this Wnt5a/ROR2 signaling is activating the Hippo pathway to suppress YAP1/TAZ activity.
While Wnt signaling has been linked to suppression of the Hippo pathway, our studies are the first to show it can
activate Hippo and provide a mechanism for the growth suppressing effects of Wnt5a. We hypothesize this
reflects a novel function of ROR2 that is context dependent, and that biomarkers can be identified that will identify
the subset of tumors that will be responsive to Wnt5a-mimetic drugs such as Foxy5, which is currently in clinical
trials. The central hypotheses of this proposal are that Wnt5a-mimetic drugs that drive noncanonical Wnt
signaling can be an effective treatment for a subset of mCRPC (and other solid tumors), that their growth
suppressive effects are through Hippo pathway activation, and that this reflects a physiological negative
feedback loop to restrain YAP1/TAZ activity. The objectives are to determine the molecular basis for Wnt5a-
mediated activation of the Hippo pathway (Aim 1) and to assess the therapeutic potential of stimulating this
pathway, including the identification of biomarkers that can predict which tumors may respond to available
Wnt5a-mimetic drugs (Aim 2)."

Glioblastoma is the most lethal form of primary brain cancer in adults with a median survival of approximately
14-16 months following diagnosis. In contrast to glioma cells, components of the tumor microenvironment (TME)
of glioblastoma are genetically stable and are considering as the promising therapeutic targets. Tumor-
associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant cell population in the TME, which account for up to 50%
of total cells in the entire glioblastoma tumor mass. Macrophages exhibit a spectrum of functions that span from
an anti-tumor (known as M1) to a pro-tumor (known as M2) phenotype. TAMs are usually skewed toward a pro-
tumor phenotype in glioblastoma. Given the predominance of these cells in glioblastoma, therapeutic strategies
for their reprogramming to an anti-tumor phenotype is desirable. G protein-coupled receptors are a large family
of receptors that are prominent pharmacological targets in biomedicine. Our preliminary data shows that G
protein-coupled receptor 183 (GPR183) is highly expressed by TAMs in glioblastoma and may involve in TAM
pro-tumor phenotype polarization. In this proposal, we will investigate whether and how GPR183 contributes to
TAM pro-tumor phenotype polarization, reveal how such polarized TAMs promote tumor progression, and
develop potential therapeutic strategies targeting TAM reprogramming in glioblastoma. To achieve these goals,
we propose the following specific Aims: Aim 1. Clarify the role and underlying mechanism of GPR183 in TAM
reprogramming in glioblastoma; Aim 2. Determine how GPR183-regulated TAM reprogramming promotes
glioblastoma progression; and Aim 3. Basic to translational study: targeting TAM reprogramming using tumor
samples and models from glioblastoma patients. We propose to employ integrated strategies combining gain-
and loss-of-function approaches, in vitro and in vivo systems, as well as proteomic and transcriptomic analysis
to test each Aim. Together, this project will uncover novel mechanisms for TAM reprogramming and reveal new
immunotherapeutic strategies for glioblastoma."
10862852,"Feeding is a fundamental behavior that is tightly regulated to precisely meet the metabolic needs of the animal.
The primary decision that an animal must make regarding food is whether to ingest it or reject it. Substances
with high nutritional value are ingested, while toxins and harmful substances are rejected. To make this decision,
the animal relies on its sense of taste to evaluate the quality of the food. Most animals respond to sweet and
bitter tastants with different stereotyped behaviors: sweet substances, often calorie rich, are appetitive and
accepted, while bitter compounds, usually harmful, are rejected and avoided. Another important part of the
decision whether to ingest or reject potential food is the metabolic need of the animal that is manifested by the
balance between hunger and satiety. This aspect of the internal state of the animals is evaluated through an
intricate balance between various hormones and neuromodulators, some signal hunger while the others signal
satiety. How the concerted action of the various hormones and neuromodulators affects feeding is an area of
significant interest as dysregulation of feeding behavior results in obesity or in malnutrition and their associated
morbidities.
In this proposal, we focus on one network of neuromodulatory neurons in Drosophila in which a neuromodulator
termed leucokinin is secreted by certain subsets of neurons within the network and detected by others. We
propose to test the hypothesis that the leucokinin network of neuromodulatory neurons integrates information
about taste quality and the internal state of the fly to modulates feeding behavior. In this network, one set of
neurons receives inputs from two others: taste information from one, and information about the internal state of
the animal from the other. The recipient neurons integrate the two streams of information and in turn modulate
feeding behavior by secreting other neuropeptides that regulate feeding. To test this hypothesis, we use a
multipronged approach that includes anatomical, functional and behavioral analyses. In our proposed study, we
use state of the art techniques to label neuronal connectivity and to manipulate the activity of selective subsets
of neurons to examine the behavioral and functional effects of these manipulations. We also develop a new
technique for studying sites of neuromodulation. This technique enables selective, unbiased, brain-wide
examination of sites of neuromodulation by specific modulators with cellular resolution. Thus, our studies will
deepen our understanding of the regulation of feeding and provide new tools to study neuromodulation, a
research area that will increase in importance as neural connectivity maps of more model organisms become
available."

Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring oncogenic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene
rearrangements (i.e., ‘ALK+’) comprise a distinct molecular subset of lung cancer with marked sensitivity to ALK
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). While ALK TKIs are initially highly effective, acquired drug resistance remains
a fundamental challenge that limits clinical benefit and causes disease relapse in most patients. We and others
have characterized mechanisms of resistance, in particular so-called “on-target” resistance mediated by
secondary acquired ALK kinase domain mutations that can be overcome with more potent next-generation (2nd-
or 3rd-generation) inhibitors. In recent years, the standard treatment paradigm for patients diagnosed with
advanced ALK+ lung cancers has shifted from sequential therapy using the 1st-generation ALK TKI crizotinib
followed by next-generation TKIs, to initial therapy using a next-generation ALK TKI upfront. Our preliminary data
indicate that off-target (i.e., ALK-independent) resistance mechanisms are prevalent following next-generation
ALK TKIs. Yet, the spectrum of off-target resistance mechanisms and strategies to overcome these remain
poorly understood, presenting a barrier to the development of treatment options for these patients. The
overarching objective of the proposed research is to identify and develop complementary, mechanism-informed
and mechanism-agnostic approaches for overcoming off-target resistance to next-generation ALK TKIs. We will
use comprehensive genomic and non-genomic assessment of an expanded cohort of patient tumor specimens
to determine the clinical spectrum of off-target resistance mechanisms after first-line use of next-generation ALK
TKIs, and we will develop new methods for identifying patients with bypass-mediated resistance most likely to
benefit from rationally designed combination therapies. Using ALK TKI-resistant tumor cell lines derived from
patient biopsies, we will screen for epigenetic mechanisms that drive resistance independent of canonical bypass
signaling pathways, with initial studies focused on defining the role of the transcriptional co-activator p300/CBP
as a novel driver of off-target ALK TKI resistance and therapeutic target. These efforts will enable patient-specific,
mechanism-informed therapeutic strategies. In parallel, we will develop a mechanism-agnostic approach that
leverages ALK as a tumor-specific “neoantigen” whose expression is maintained in resistant tumors. Using T
cell-based functional screens, we will identify ALK-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs) that are capable of
recognizing resistant ALK+ NSCLCs. This will provide the foundation for engineering ALK TCR adoptive cellular
therapy as a TKI-orthogonal, immune-based approach for overcoming resistance. Collectively, the proposed
studies will provide a comprehensive understanding of resistance to next-generation ALK TKIs and pave the way
for the development of new therapeutic strategies that can effectively overcome most of off-target resistance in
the clinic, ultimately improving and prolonging the lives of patients with advanced ALK+ lung cancers."

Despite misconceptions that young children do not experience self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (STBs),
data from samples of youth that include children under age 9 suggest rates of suicidal ideation between
11%–19%, non-suicidal self-injury at 6.2%–21%, and suicide attempts between 2.4%–3.5%. Although rare,
rates of suicide death in young children are increasing. However, the development of STBs in young children
is vastly understudied. Our team’s research demonstrates a robust link between threat exposure history and
risk for STBs in youth. Moreover, data support that threat experiences increase risk for STBs possibly
through heightened emotional reactivity and reactive aggression. Much of the work examining the impact of
threat exposure on the development of STBs focuses on adolescent youth, long after many children have
experienced threat and after STBs have developed for some youth. The purpose of the current study is to
test key components of our conceptual model positing that a history of exposure to threat initiates develop-
mental pathways toward earlier risk for STBs in young children through its influence on emotional reactivity
and reactive aggression. Moreover, youth may be at greatest risk for STBs in the days after future threat and
non-threat negative events occur, highlighting the need to understand potential short-term risk (i.e., over
days) for STBs among young children. Aim 1 of this proposal will investigate the extent to which more severe
and multiple threat exposures contribute to earlier emergence of STBs in young children ages 5–9. Aim 2 will
examine emotional reactivity and reactive aggression as predictors of STBs, including short-term (days) and
longer-term (months) predictors, and as mechanisms through which threat may influence STBs. Aim 3 will
examine the extent to which future threat and non-threat negative events amplify short- and long-term risk for
STBs among young children with emotional reactivity and reactive aggression. We will conduct exploratory
analyses testing our full model positing that threat influences STBs through heightened emotional reactivity
and reactive aggression, particularly when future threat or non-threat events occur. We will also explore sex
and race differences in STBs in young children. We will enroll 300 5- to 7-year-olds with a history of a range
of threat exposure and their caregiver in a racially diverse catchment area and follow youth longitudinally for
2 years (until ages 7–9). Youth and caregivers will complete an in-home baseline assessment composed of
multiple methods, including clinical interviews; questionnaires; and observational, physiological (i.e.,
respiratory sinus arrythmia), and behavioral measures within developmentally relevant negative emotional
contexts (e.g., social-evaluative stressor). Caregivers and youth will complete three 1-week periods of daily
diary assessments spaced 1 month apart to assess short-term STB risk. Remote follow-up assessments will
occur every 6 months to examine long-term STB risk. This project will have a high impact on the field by
examining early pathways to STB risk and identifying intervention points to offset negative trajectories."

Human natural killer (NK) cells are critical for control of viral infection and their importance for tumor
surveillance is underscored by their emerging use as a cancer immunotherapeutic tool. Understanding unique
aspects of human NK cells that are not uncovered by the biology of murine NK cells is critical to advancing our
use of NK cells in immunotherapy. CD56, which is the glycoprotein neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), is
ubiquitously expressed on human, but not mouse, NK cells. In part because of its uniquely human expression,
the molecular function of CD56/NCAM has not elucidated on immune cells. Our preliminary data demonstrates
that CD56/NCAM plays a functional role on human NK cells and indicates key aspects of unique CD56/NCAM
biology that dictate its function. To delineate this function, we will closely examine three aspects of
CD56/NCAM function in three independent aims. Aim 1 will determine the functional effect of the addition of
polysialic acid to CD56/NCAM and the role that the steric properties of polysialic acid have on the membrane
diffusion of CD56/NCAM and other NK cell activating receptors and integrins. Aim 2 will define the linkage
between CD56/NCAM and the NK cell cytoskeleton, including delineating the link between CD56 and actin.
Aim 3 will identify intracellular binding partners of CD56/NCAM and determine the role that lipid raft
recruitment plays in its signaling and function. Together, these aims will delineate the function of this
universally expressed and but poorly understood receptor on human NK cells. It will also provide critical insight
into the functional role that CD56/NCAM, and glycoproteins in general, play in dictating critical NK cell
functions including cell migration and target cell killing."
10912793,"Patients with skeletal dysplasias, including osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), often suffer from congenital respiratory
problems that have limited therapeutic opportunities, and increased perinatal and early childhood mortality. OI
is caused by dominant mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes or by loss of function of genes involved in
COL1 processing (e.g., CRTAP, encoding an essential protein for collagen post-translational modification and
folding). The current concept is that the respiratory abnormalities in OI are secondary to the skeletal defects,
such as thoracic wall deformities and deviations of the spine curvature (kyphoscoliosis), which do not allow
proper expansion and inflation of the lungs leading to restrictive disease. We demonstrated that COL1 production
is dysregulated in lung fibroblasts from a mouse model of OI lacking the Crtap gene (CrtapKO). These mice also
exhibit defective lung alveolar formation, loss of alveolar epithelial cells, and several changes in genes
expression, including decreased myofibroblast markers, as quantified by spatially resolved transcriptomics. In
addition, CrtapKO mice and two others mouse models of OI with COL1 mutations (Col1a2G610C/+ and oim/oim)
exhibit altered respiratory mechanics at 3 months of age. Based on this evidence and because COL1 is
expressed in most tissues including the lung, our central hypothesis is that the respiratory defects in patients
with OI and other skeletal dysplasias are due to intrinsic lung dysfunction that, in the future, could be treated
and/or corrected independently from the skeletal fragility. The specific goals are 1) dissect the contribution of
intrinsic lung defects versus extrinsic skeletal defects to impaired lung functions in OI; and 2) unravel cellular
and molecular mechanisms triggered by COL1 defects leading to abnormal lung development and impaired
respiratory function. To test our hypothesis, we assembled a team with complementary expertise that is uniquely
positioned to accomplish our goals. The specific aims are: to determine the respiratory phenotype of a novel
knock-in mouse model expressing a classical Col1a1 OI glycine substitution mutation in the lung but not in the
skeleton (Col1a1Flox/+;Tbx4-Cre) and compare it to that of mice expressing this mutation globally (aim 1). To
identify the cause of impaired alveolar morphogenesis and key pathways contributing to changes in alveolar
mesenchymal-epithelial cell interactions in CrtapKO cell cultures and organoids (aim 2). To identify causes of
impaired alveolar morphogenesis and abnormal patterning and function of lung cells in CrtapKO mice in vivo by
analyzing the entire transcriptome in 5-7 µm lung sections with 100 µm or better lateral resolution during the
critical stage of alveolar formation (aim 3). Together, aims 1-3 will provide mechanistic insights and establish the
relationship between the collagen matrix and cellular dysfunction causing lung-intrinsic defects in OI leading to
a better understanding of the role of the matrix in the last stage of lung development. Ultimately, this work will
provide new insights into more common diseases of collagen dysregulation in the lung such as fibrosis and
bronchopulmonary dysplasia."

Uncertainty in genomic diagnostics creates a barrier to realizing the full potential of genomic medicine.
Uncertainty is evident in: 1) our inability to determine if some DNA variants are pathogenic or benign and 2) our
inability to predict to what extent a person with a disease-causing variant will be affected, due to variable
expressivity. This proposal will study both phenomena for the autosomal dominant disorder Alagille syndrome,
caused by mutations in one of two genes in the Notch signaling pathway, the ligand JAGGED1 (JAG1) or the
receptor, NOTCH2. Alagille syndrome is characterized by pediatric liver, heart, vertebral, renal, ocular, and
facial anomalies with highly variable expressivity. The mechanism of disease for JAG1-related Alagille
syndrome is haploinsufficiency whereas the mechanism for NOTCH2-related Alagille syndrome is less clear,
with fewer reported variants, less functional characterization, and a higher prevalence of missense variants
(>50%). Missense variants are difficult to classify, often requiring functional validation to support or reject
pathogenicity. In Alagille syndrome, functional characterization has been carried out for only 19/125 reported
missense mutations, thus, despite a high detection rate, the diagnostic rate is lower due to this uncertainty.
We propose to resolve uncertainty in the diagnostics of Alagille syndrome using assays designed to
characterize the pathogenicity of JAG1 and NOTCH2 missense variants and analysis of gene expression data
from patient liver samples to identify gene expression signatures that can be used for genotype-phenotype
evaluations. In Aim 1, we will design a Site Saturation Variant Library of all possible nucleotide permutations at
each nucleotide position across a region with high missense variant uncertainty in the JAG1 C-terminus and
test this library by developing a Multiplexed Assay for Variant Effects (MAVEs) that will measure cellular
localization of JAG1 as a readout of protein function. In Aim 2, we will use FFPE liver tissue samples to
analyze gene expression differences between Alagille syndrome patients and controls, as well as between
Alagille syndrome patients with mild versus severe liver disease. In Aim 3, we will study the molecular basis of
NOTCH2 variants through functional, expression, and enzymatic assays using mutant cell lines. We
hypothesize that these proposed assays will identify a high-throughput method to test missense pathogenicity
(Aim 1), identify gene expression differences between Alagille syndrome patients and controls as well as gene
expression signatures that are different between Alagille syndrome patients with mild versus severe liver
disease (Aim 2), and determine the mechanism by which NOTCH2 variants cause Alagille syndrome through
functional analysis (Aim 3). Ultimately, these data will improve variant analysis for Alagille syndrome,
improve our understanding of the molecular basis of liver disease in Alagille syndrome, and establish
a framework for scalable classification of missense variants, delivering diagnostic information that can
directly help clinicians."

 Development of effective therapies for glioblastoma (GBM) remains a major challenge despite decades of
intensive research. Coupled with intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, the infiltration of normal brain tissue
by GBM cells poses unique therapeutic challenges. Further, the specialized neurovascular unit that forms the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) is partially intact in GBM and results in heterogeneous, sub-therapeutic delivery of
most cytotoxic chemotherapies to regions of every GBM. We have previously shown that the efficacy of
otherwise highly potent antibody-drug conjugates is specifically limited in GBM by poor delivery across the
BBB. Like antibodies, single-strand DNA aptamers fold into unique 3-dimensional shapes with epitope binding
affinities that rival those of antibodies, and some aptamers also efficiently traverse the BBB. In contrast to the
laborious development of antibody-based therapeutics, the integration of solid-support synthesis, PCR
amplification, and next-generation sequencing technologies enable massively parallel screening strategies,
known as ‘systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX)’, to identify individual DNA
aptamers with desired physical and biological features through successive rounds of negative and/or positive
selection. Based on prior experience with this strategy, we hypothesize that tumor-specific DNA aptamer-drug
conjugates (ApDCs) optimized for distribution across the BBB can be efficiently identified using in vivo SELEX
with libraries of aptamer-drug conjugates and orthotopic GBM patient-derived xenografts. To address tumor
heterogeneity, in vivo selection will be performed across multiple PDXs, and single cell sequencing technology
will be leveraged to identify ApDCs that bind to diverse subsets of tumor cells and not normal cells within the
brain. The goal of this application is to develop a robust platform for efficient screening of GBM-specific
ApDCs. This will be accomplished by addressing three Aims.
Aim 1 – R61: Optimize design and sequencing of aptamer-toxin libraries
 We will optimize strategies for toxin conjugation during library processing through multiple SELEX rounds.
Extending our preliminary data demonstrating MMAE toxin stability to PCR thermal cycling, we will optimize
toxin-conjugated PCR primers for library preparation and single-cell RNA/aptamer-seq.
Aim 2 – R61: Determine optimum training round strategy to identify brain tumor-specific ApDCs
 We will optimize the time between DNA library injection and tissue collection. We also will evaluate a novel
SELEX reward strategy based on selectively capturing aptamers only after cleavage of MMAE from an ApDC.
Aim 3 – R33: Apply in vivo SELEX with orthotopic GBM PDXs to train ApDC libraries
In vivo SELEX will be performed with an ApDC library across a heterogenous set of orthotopic GBM PDXs to
understand the potential for targeting heterogeneous tumor and sparing normal cell populations."

Background ER+ breast cancer accounts for 2/3 of invasive breast cancer cases diagnosed in the world today. In
patients, ~12% of ER+ tumors have complete loss of MLH1, a tumor suppressor and mismatch repair protein.
We previously showed that MLH1 loss in ER+ breast cancer cells activates HER2 to induce resistance to standard
endocrine therapy. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Preliminary data support a role for
MLH1 loss in altering secretion of HER ligands to mediate HER2 activation. This is of particular interest because
an additional 14% of ER+ patient tumors have heterogeneous loss of MLH1. Although the functional consequence
of heterogeneous MLH1 loss is as yet unknown, a role for MLH1 loss in altering the cancer secretome suggests
a potentially significant impact on bulk tumor phenotypes.
Hypothesis Based on our published work and preliminary data, the proposed study will test the hypothesis that
MLH1 loss in ER+ breast cancer induces secretion of HER ligands, by co-opting cGAS-STING signaling, to
promote HER2-dependent growth of both MLH1– and MLH1+ cells in heterogeneously MLH1– tumors.
Specific Aims Aim 1 will test whether the secretion of HER ligands induced by MLH1 loss mediates HER2
activation to promote endocrine therapy resistance. Here, we will use both in vitro and in vivo approaches to
determine whether the ligands secreted by MLH1- ER+ breast cancer cells promote HER2 heterodimerization
and consequent activation, and thereby endocrine therapy resistant growth. Aim 2 will investigate the mechanism
linking MLH1 loss to HER ligand secretion. Specifically, we will test whether inefficient DNA damage repair in
the absence of MLH1 triggers the cGAS-STING secretory pathway. We will also determine how cGAS-STING
activation promotes HER ligand secretion. Aim 3 will examine the therapeutic impact of heterogeneous MLH1
loss. Using in vitro and in vivo experimental models established in my lab, we will test whether HER2 activation
in both MLH1+ and MLH1- cells in tumors with heterogeneous MLH1 loss renders these tumors globally
susceptible to HER2 inhibitors. We will also use digital spatial profiling to assess the contribution of the secretome
to signaling patterns and therapeutic response in heterogeneously MLH1- tumors.
Impact The results of this study will present new therapeutic strategies to help >25,000 women diagnosed each
year with ER+ breast cancer characterized by heterogeneous MLH1 loss. Our work will also provide novel insight
into how MLH1 loss modulates the cGAS-STING pathway to promote a pro-growth tumor secretome. Overall,
results from this study will shed new insight into the how MLH1 loss promotes cancer phenotypes."
10892303,"Dental implants have become an important routine component of dental practice with over five million fixtures
placed annually in the United States and this number is expected to increase significantly in the future. The
peri-implant soft tissue interface is less effective than natural teeth in resisting bacterial invasion, enhancing
vulnerability to subsequent peri-implant disease. Peri-implant diseases are inflammatory conditions affecting
the soft/hard tissues surrounding a functional dental implant. Plenty of experimental evidence indicates that the
accumulation of dental plaque at the soft tissue-implant interface and the subsequent local inflammatory
response seems to be key in the pathogenesis of peri-implant mucositis. Furthermore, in certain individuals, it
will progress to peri-implantitis, resulting in alveolar bone loss and implant failure. The goal of this application is
to create a novel dental implant construct that renders the implant-supported restoration antibiofilm while
providing a tight gingival tissue-implant seal that serves as a barrier to bacterial invasion. This smart dental
implant system is a battery-less system that converts biomechanical forces from human oral motions (e.g.,
chewing or tooth-brushing) into electrical energy and powers light-emitting diodes that enable in situ
phototherapy. When used in combination with a long-lasting antibiofilm restorative surface, this self-powered
precision phototherapy system circumvents problems with the use of conventional antimicrobials. Ongoing
studies indicate that red and near-infrared light is effective in maintaining human gingival tissue cell viability in
the face of mono- and multi-microbial challenges. Furthermore, the antibiofilm restorative surface almost
completely inhibits bacterial colonization. Based on these exciting supporting data, we hypothesize that force-
powering of piezoelectric crystals to produce red and near-infrared light combined with bacterial anti-adhesive
restorations creates an anti-inflammatory, pro-healing environment that provides a robust soft-tissue seal and
prevents the development of peri-implantitis. We anticipate that the creation of this next-generation anti-
inflammatory, antibiofilm dental implant system would increase functionality and provide a new strategy to
prevent and control peri-implant diseases, especially in populations at risk, and reduce the risk of implant
failure."

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a life-saving treatment for hematologic malignancies that
remains the treatment of choice for conditions such as high risk leukemias. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is
a common complication of allogeneic HCT, affecting >50% of patients. Despite decades of progress in
transplantation biology, we have limited treatment options for this common condition associated with substantial
morbidity and mortality. GvHD has been linked to loss of gut bacterial diversity and changes in bacterial
community composition after HCT. There is compelling evidence from antibiotic intervention studies in animals
and humans that manipulation of the gut microbiota influences subsequent risk of GvHD. Observational studies
of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have generated intriguing data suggesting that FMT is a promising
intervention for safely repopulating the gut microbiota in HCT recipients with GvHD. However, the effect of FMT
delivery route on microbial reconstitution has not been investigated in a controlled manner, the role of dietary
supplementation on maintaining a beneficial gut microbiota after FMT remains unexplored in this population, and
there is limited insight into mechanisms for how the microbiota may impact clinical outcomes after FMT. For
example, administering FMT via oral capsules may seed a larger area of the intestinal tract yielding more durable
changes in gut microbial colonization, but conversely could lead to loss of functionally important bacterial species
through killing by gastric acid and bile salts in the upper tract. Similarly, colonization efficiency may be enhanced
by providing bacteria with key nutrients such as dietary fiber. In addition, dietary fiber is a substrate for bacterial
production of short chain fatty acids such as butyrate linked to immune modulation and intestinal health. It is
unknown if dietary fiber supplementation enhances microbiological engraftment after FMT in these patients or
fosters a metabolic environment that promotes healing after HCT related gut injury. There are no published
randomized controlled trials of FMT for treatment of GvHD. Our proposed F2 study (FMT x Fiber) in patients with
gut GvHD will investigate how route of FMT (oral capsule, upper vs. colonic instillation, lower) and dietary fiber
supplementation influence reconstitution of a beneficial microbiota. This study will feature frequent stool
sampling, robust analysis of bacterial community composition and metagenomic content in stool, evaluation of
the impact of the interventions on recovery of T-cell subsets in blood with known associations with GvHD,
assessment of metabolites such as short chain fatty acids produced by the gut microbiota that may ameliorate
GvHD, and follow-up to assess resolution of GvHD symptoms, stage, and grade. These in-depth longitudinal
microbial, metabolic, nutritional, immunological, and clinical data will allow a much-needed, mechanistic
investigation of how a beneficial gut microbiome can be optimally restored and maintained through FMT for
treatment of GvHD."

Macrophages are first responder immune cells present in every tissue. Their responses are mediated by
signaling pathways that activate hundreds of immune response genes. Two functional hallmarks characterize
the deployment of all macrophage functions:
(1) Stimulus-Response Specificity. Immune responses are powerful, and often detrimental for the host. Hence,
they must be deployed on an “only-as-needed” basis. However, it remains unknown how specific macrophage
responses are, and what mechanisms control Response Specificity. Quantifying the specificity of responses
requires single-cell measurements of signaling or gene expression trajectories, and the development of analysis
methods to compare distributions, quantify information content, precision of classification and confusion.
(2) Context-Dependent Functional States. Macrophage functions adapt to the tissue microenvironment via the
cytokine milieu characteristic of the tissue and the prior history of immune responses or pathogen exposure. As
monocytes circulate through the body passing through tissues, they are potential biosensors of injury or infection.
While prior studies have characterized these states via steady-state molecular profiling of chromatin or
transcriptome, single-cell stimulus response data may be more informative of actual functional states.
Considering these functional hallmarks of macrophages lead to two hypotheses that this proposal addresses:
1) Quantitative measurements of single cell stimulus responses reveal that macrophage Response Specificity is
modulated by physiological and pathological context by affecting the distributions that characterize
heterogeneous responses in the population. 2) Quantifying the Response Specificity of individual macrophages
allows for a characterization of their Functional States, that is distinct from single-cell transcriptomic profiling.
We will address these hypotheses using experimental, math modeling, and computational analysis iteratively.
In Aim 1, we will determine which molecular mechanisms that drive cell-to-cell heterogeneity and why the
specificity of NFκB stimulus-responses is altered by cytokine polarization states.
In Aim 2, we will use a novel model-aided data integration approach to quantify for the first time the Response
Specificity of individual macrophages. This will allow us to map the landscape of macrophage states based on
stimulus-responses and parameters, and compare it to maps of traditional steady-state scRNA-seq data.
In Aim 3, we will study how the stimulus-specificity of immune gene expression responses in single-cells are
affected by polarization. With a novel model-aided approach, we are able to reconstruct dynamic trajectories
and determine whether Response Specificity is better assessed by mRNA abundances or dynamical features.
After finetuning these approaches on in vitro polarized macrophages, we will apply them to macrophages from
mouse models of ill-health. Insights may guide future translational studies to assess Innate immune Health."
10897924,"Uveal coloboma, a condition estimated to occur in ~1:10,000 live births, is a significant cause of blindness
worldwide. It is characterized by a hole or cleft in the eye, and results from defective formation or closure of the
optic fissure, a transient, yet vital structure through which retinal axons exit and vasculature enters the eye.
Despite its importance, we have a poor understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing optic
fissure development, especially the crucial initial step of formation: if the fissure does not form correctly, it will
not undergo closure. The conserved Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is crucial: in Gorlin Syndrome, overactive
Hh signaling, in the context of the PTCH mutant (ptch2 in zebrafish) causes coloboma.
 In the past funding cycle, we determined the cell movements underlying optic fissure formation, using 4-
dimensional imaging and cell tracking. Surprisingly, we found that a previously undescribed folding event in the
ventral eye drives optic fissure formation, however, the underlying cell shape changes and rearrangements are
unknown. In the ptch2 mutant, we uncovered key mechanisms by which overactive Hh signaling perturbs this
process and found that downstream targets of Hh signaling are responsible for disrupting cell movements.
Therefore, we performed single-cell RNA-seq to identify Hh target genes controlling optic fissure formation:
matrix proteoglycans (agrin, dystroglycan, and syndecan-4) and mitochondria genes have informed our new
directions. Here we take advantage of the unique optical transparency and rapid development of zebrafish
embryos to directly examine optic fissure formation in vivo. We recently developed imaging and computational
approaches to visualize and quantitatively analyze dynamics of cell movements, shape, and orientation driving
optic fissure formation for the first time, as well as molecular genetic methods to perturb signaling pathways. In
this proposal, we will uncover the cellular mechanisms directly responsible for optic fissure formation, as well as
the role of tissue-tissue interactions with the olfactory placode, and intrinsic metabolic activity.
 Our hypothesis is that active cell shape changes and reorientation drive optic fissure formation, and
this process relies on mechanical coupling with the olfactory placode via matrix proteoglycans, as well
as intracellular mitochondrial dynamics. Combining molecular genetics, live imaging, custom computational
methods and quantitative image analyses, we will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims: (1) establish
the morphogenetic mechanisms driving optic fissure formation and its disruption in coloboma; (2) determine the
cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the olfactory placode influences optic fissure formation; and (3)
determine how mitochondrial dynamics contribute to optic fissure formation and its disruption in coloboma.
 Our proposed mechanistic experiments will expand the coloboma gene regulatory network, provide
resources to inform patient phenotypes, and establish new potential therapeutic targets with implications for
numerous human coloboma conditions in addition to Gorlin Syndrome."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the fastest rising cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide with a 5-year
survival of <20%, affects more than 41,000 individuals in the United States every year. Heavy alcohol
consumption leading to fatty liver, hepatitis and cirrhosis has been identified as a key risk factor in HCC
development. Current therapies against alcohol liver disease (ALD) and associated fibrosis are non-specific and
ineffective. Alcohol abstinence remains the gold standard for ALD treatment to prevent progression to HCC,
however this is often hampered by poor compliance. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel
multifunctional nanoparticle (NP) platform (lipid-PLGA NPs) for treatment of alcohol-associated fibrosis via
targeted activation of G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor (Gpbar1) and anti-fibrotic drug delivery. The NPs will
also release collagenase to facilitate greater NP penetration into the fibrotic liver tissue. We hypothesize that (i)
NP-mediated targeted activation of Gpbar1 – a membrane protein expressed in Kupffer cells (KCs) and not
hepatocytes, will suppress NF-kβ and STAT3 signaling responsible for HCC development, and (ii) targeted
Gpbar1 activation and concurrent anti-fibrotic drug release will synergistically inhibit profibrotic biomarker
expressions and cytokine signaling, leading to attenuation of fibrosis. Preliminary investigations by our
collaborative research team confirmed that the NPs can selectively accumulate in the KCs in in vivo mouse
models. Our proposed aims are: (1) Characterization and in vitro evaluation of liver tissue penetration properties
of the collagenase-containing lipid-PLGA NPs. Physicochemical characterization will be done to ensure that the
lipid-PLGA NPs will have optimal properties for accumulation in the liver. A 3D multicellular spheroid model of
alcohol-induced liver fibrosis will be used to evaluate cytocompatibility, optimum uptake concentrations, and
tissue penetration by the NPs in vitro. (2) Gpbar1 agonist incorporation and in vivo elucidation of safety,
biodistribution and Gpbar1 targeting capabilities of the NPs. Gpbar1 targeting, safety and anti-fibrotic effects of
the lipid-PLGA NPs will be investigated using a widely studied and reported carbon tetrachloride-plus-alcohol
induced mouse models of liver fibrosis. (3) In vitro and in vivo evaluation of synergistic effects of Gpbar1-targeting
lipid-PLGA NPs given in combination with anti-fibrotic therapies. In this aim, the synergistic effects of Gpbar1
activation and interleukin-17A signaling inhibition on fibrosis attenuation will be determined following
encapsulation of anti-fibrotic therapies within the lipid-PLGA NPs. NP efficacy will be evaluated using histology,
biomarker analysis and collagen assays. As a first step towards assessing the translational potential of the
formulation, we will then investigate the therapeutic effects of the NPs using novel ALD liver fibrosis-on-a-chip
developed using primary murine cells. This innovative project will lead to a paradigm shift in the development
and testing of new therapeutic strategies against chronic liver diseases to prevent their progression to HCC."
10914251,"ABSTRACT
Older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) require care from numerous specialists
and clinical teams to manage ADRD-related symptoms and other comorbidities. The majority of patients with
ADRD have their healthcare managed by non-specialists who often lack the time, confidence, and expertise to
manage ongoing ADRD needs, which leads to significant referral-based care that often suffers from a lack of
coordination. Supporting primary care providers in their ongoing management of care for patients with ADRD by
promoting deliberate organization of care activities and information sharing among clinical teams is a critical
opportunity to limit unintended gaps and ensure that patients with ADRD receive the high-quality multidisciplinary
care necessary for long-term wellbeing. Few solutions exist to measure and identify gaps in care coordination.
Current approaches primarily rely on single payor claims data to evaluate patient sharing relationships between
providers, which neglects to provide granular insight necessary to improve local healthcare delivery. Applying
advanced statistical modeling to EHR usage and communication data will provide critical insight into healthcare
delivery patterns necessary to accurately model and optimize referral-based care coordination.
In the proposed project, I will apply innovative knowledge representation and machine learning to improve
referral-based care coordination by developing intelligent approaches that monitor coordination activities and
recommend actionable opportunities for improvement. Under the guidance of a multidisciplinary team of mentors,
I will receive training to expand my knowledge in healthcare delivery to promote healthy aging, further my
knowledge of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, and will develop a deeper understanding of
quantitative approaches to investigate complex sociotechnical systems. I will apply this training to address
knowledge gaps related to the formation of referral-based clinical teams in the first two aims: (1) model and
identify patterns of collaboration among healthcare providers teams treating patients with ADRD that contribute
to improved healthcare delivery; and (2) apply natural language processing to messages sent via patient portal
understand how patient and caregiver interactions influence care patterns. In aim 3, I will combine insights and
collaboration networks from the first two aims to develop explainable machine learning models to identify optimal
patterns of care coordination. I will use these optimal care coordination patterns to highlight features that cause
deviation in a patient’s treatment pathway and identify actionable steps for improvement.
This career development award will provide the rigorous training and mentorship necessary to become a fully
independent principal investigator. The research will benefit from a PI who has a strong background in
information science, knowledge representation, and collaboration analytics. I have assembled an outstanding
multidisciplinary team of mentors with extensive expertise across all areas of the proposed project and will
receive exceptional support from an outstanding environment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center."
10917386,"Interpersonal violence is a leading cause of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a debilitating syndrome
characterized by sleep disturbances, flashbacks, and dysregulated emotional reactivity. For some trauma-
exposed individuals, deficits in emotion regulation can escalate to aggression, thereby perpetuating a cycle of
interpersonal violence and trauma. Understanding how stressors affect the neural circuitry of aggression is
fundamental to developing effective therapies for this form of violence. Central amygdala (CeA) neurons that
express the well-characterized stress signaling neuropeptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (Crh), are critical
mediators of fear-induced reactions, and through my postdoctoral single-cell calcium imaging training in the
Ressler Lab, I have identified a distinct Crh+ CeA cell activity signature during the emergence of offensive
aggression. In Aim 1 (K99), I will use closed-loop optogenetics to extend these preliminary findings to understand
the causal role of Crh+ CeA cells in initiating aggression. Using my novel and recently validated model for social
trauma-induced aggression – where experimental mice are attacked inside of their home environment by a
dominant intruder – it is possible to explore the impact of violence on fear circuitry. Such trauma-exposed mice
adopt heightened defensive tactics including atypical, generalized aggression toward non-threatening social
partners. In Aim 2 (R00), this model for social trauma will be used to determine if stress recruits pro-aggressive
Crh+ CeA cell activity, and to experimentally block this recruitment and the development of trauma-induced
aggression. Aim 3 (R00) will begin to explore top-down cortical regulation of this translational stress-induced
aggressive phenotype. The insular cortex (IC) innervates Crh+ CeA cells and this projection is functionally linked
to hostility in clinical experiments. Aim 3 will establish if social trauma increases aggression by amplifying IC
inputs to Crh+ CeA neurons. This K99/R00 will support an important stage of my postdoctoral training in single-
cell imaging and closed-loop all-optical approaches which will be necessary to continue exploring cortical
underpinnings of dysregulated emotional reactivity. Mastering these versatile methodological approaches will
guide my future independent research program in identifying translational connections between stress-sensitive
neural systems and the complex orchestration of violent behaviors."
10903910,"SUMMARY
The inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) are the first two cell types specified during mammalian
development. TE cells support implantation and give rise to the placenta, whereas ICM cells forms the embryo
and some extraembryonic tissues. Their differentiation is therefore critical for successful pregnancy. The
mechanically-regulated Hippo signaling pathway is differentially activated in ICM and TE cells, driving gene
expression programs that define these cell states. These programs also depend on cell type-specific chromatin
landscapes. How mechanical forces regulate chromatin structure and embryonic cell fates during pre-
implantation is however not fully understood. I hypothesize that mechanical forces transmitted though the
cytoskeleton, regulate TE transcriptional programs by modulating both Hippo signaling and chromatin structure.
In this proposal, I will test this hypothesis by defining how nuclear tension regulates Hippo signaling and
chromatin organization during early embryonic differentiations. My ultimate goal is to define the mechanistic links
connecting mechanical and regulatory pathways to cell and chromatin states. This work will enhance our
understanding of cell fate specification, both in relationship to early embryogenesis and implantation, and more
broadly. My postdoctoral work in the Giraldez lab showed that Lamin A/C is transcriptionally up-regulated in TE,
compared to ICM, and that it regulates TE identify; LMNA/C depletion leads to an ICM-like transcriptional state
reminiscent of Hippo pathway activation. In Aim 1 (K99), I will investigate regulation of Hippo by Lamin A/C and
determine the role of mechanical sensing by cytoskeletal networks in the regulation of this signaling. In Aim 2
(K99/R00), to determine how mechanical forces regulate chromatin, I will apply advanced electron microscopy
approaches to visualize nucleosome resolution chromatin structure in vivo. During the training period in the
Giraldez lab, I will apply a novel labeling strategy, combined with cryo EM to characterize lamina-heterochromatin
interactions. During the R00 period and beyond, I will apply these approaches to determine how compaction of
the embryo and the generation of mechanical forces on the nucleus impact chromatin structure and ICM/TE
fates. In Aim 3 (R00), I will use chimeric embryos and other developmental assays to examine how changes in
the mechanical properties of the nucleus affects differentiation potential. I will also quantify nuclear stiffness and
chromatin structure in developing mouse embryos. This work paves the way for a deeper understanding of the
role of mechanical forces in regulating gene expression and cell identity. This proposal brings together training
and concepts that I have acquired throughout my education and new approaches (RNA-seq and cryo-EM) that
I will learn in my mentor’s (Giraldez) lab, from other scientists and specialists at Yale, and at the lab of my co-
mentors, Elizabeth Villa and Berna Sozen. This proposal will complete my postdoctoral training and prepare me
for my ultimate goal of running a competitive independent research program."
10868684,"Project Summary/Abstract
Approximately 30% of US adults are affected by a voice disorder during their lives, with about 25 million people
experiencing a voice disorder at any given point in time, resulting in societal costs (lost work, medical expenses,
etc.) estimated at $13.5 billion annually. Vocal fatigue (VF) is viewed as an etiological and/or reactive component
in most common voice disorders and is also among the most common voice-related complaints of individuals
who rely on their voices to make a living (e.g., teachers, singers, etc.). Previous definitions of VF have varied
with a recent attempt at consensus describing VF as a multifaceted concept that involves an individual’s self-
perceived symptoms (e.g., increased effort and discomfort) and/or a deterioration in vocal function associated
with an individual’s attempt to meet his/her vocal demands. Prior studies have demonstrated high speaker-to-
speaker variability in recovery from VF, but the factors associated with such high variability are not determined.
Unfortunately, there is a paucity of objective information about the causes and impact on phonatory mechanisms
of VF, limiting efforts to prevent and clinically manage this common complaint.
The objectives of this project are (1) to use a multi-modal measurement approach to comprehensively, and
objectively, describe the progressive impact of VF on vocal function, (2) to quantify the underlying voicing-resting
behaviors that contribute to the progression of VF and its recovery, and (3) to identify the vocal function and
vocal behavior parameters that could account for the observed high variability in VF recovery trajectories. The
objectives of this study are pursued using a combination of an existing ambulatory voice monitoring dataset and
new data. The existing dataset includes ambulatory voice recordings from 87 vocally typical individuals (for a
total of 889 days) and 123 patients with vocal hyperfunction (for a total of 763 days). The new data will include
a well-controlled inlab vocal loading protocol, and three days of infield monitoring using a state-of-the-art wireless
monitoring system. The inlab session will include periodic multi-modal data acquisition of vocal function (high-
speed videoendoscopy, aerodynamics, electroglottography, acoustics, and neck-surface accelerometry) during
the progression of the loading protocol. Statistical power of machine learning is combined with two novel
ambulatory measures of vocal fold dissipated energy (reflecting vocal function) and a time series voicing-resting
ratio (the temporal sequencing of phonatory and resting periods reflecting vocal behavior) to quantify progression
and recovery of VF in terms of a person’s prior cumulative vocal behavior and vocal function.
Achieving the goals of this project will lay the groundwork for the development of new clinical tools for preventing,
assessing, and alleviating VF, which will be particularly valuable for professionals in occupations requiring heavy
voice use."

Melioidosis is an often-fatal infection caused by inhalation, inoculation, or ingestion of the Gram-negative
facultative intracellular pathogen and Tier 1 select agent Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bps). Bps has recently
been isolated from the soil in the southern United States. Worldwide, 165,000 cases of melioidosis are
estimated to occur each year; 85,000 (52%) of these patients die. Pneumonia is present in over 50% of
melioidosis cases and more than doubles the risk of death. Yet, to develop novel, targeted therapeutics
necessitates a deeper understanding of pulmonary and systemic mechanisms of host defense. Our team
combines expertise in human and experimental melioidosis, pulmonary host defense, sepsis, and
bioinformatics. We have developed a robust murine model of Bps pneumonia displaying mild and severe
disease phenotypes. In parallel we have performed unbiased multi-omics analyses on a large prospective
cohort of hospitalized patients with infection in NE Thailand with the goal of classifying melioidosis cases and
understanding the host response to Bps. We identified distinct transcriptional and metabolomic profiles
associated with melioidosis compared to other infected patients, and have built robust classifiers in each omics
domain to predict death in human melioidosis. However, to comprehensively investigate mechanistic
underpinnings requires a tractable experimental model with sufficient comparability to human disease.
Moreover, to study the lethality of respiratory melioidosis requires sampling of lung tissue. We hypothesize that
applying a comparative multi-omic approach to mice and humans with respiratory melioidosis will both a) yield
critical insights into the pulmonary host defense mechanisms that fail to contain the infection and contribute to
severe outcomes and b) establish comparability of the experimental murine model with human infection. We
submit the following specific aims: 1). Define the temporal trajectory of multi-omic features of systemic host
defense in murine respiratory melioidosis and identify perturbations representing success or failure of host
defense. 2) Define lung cell-specific transcriptomic changes in murine respiratory melioidosis and identify
signals that are associated with success or failure of pulmonary host defense. 3) Identify shared multi-omic
signatures between murine and human respiratory melioidosis. The results of these studies will generate a rich
compendium of data about the systemic and pulmonary host response to murine respiratory melioidosis and
provide novel and comprehensive insights into the heterogeneity and key biological pathways underlying failed
host response phenotypes of melioidosis pneumonia. Intersecting these findings with existing human
melioidosis data will help to define clinically relevant targets for further investigation while simultaneously
providing essential information about advantages and limitations of the animal model in recapitulating human
infection at the multi-omic level."
10728339,"Group A streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) is a leading bacterial pathogen of the
human pharynx and skin. In recent years, a striking resurgence in severe invasive GAS
infections has been observed worldwide. GAS infections account for more than 650,000 cases
of severe invasive disease annually. The invasive GAS infections, necrotizing fasciitis, cellulitis
and erysipelas with concomitant scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic syndrome, are difficult to
treat with antibiotics, and a GAS vaccine is urgently needed to combat this neglected disease. A
major component of the GAS cell wall is the Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) covalently linked to
peptidoglycan, consisting of a polyrhamnose backbone with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)
side-chains. GAC is an attractive vaccine candidate due to its conserved expression in all GAS
serotypes and the absence of its constitutive component, rhamnose, in humans. Our genetic,
biochemical and structural studies identified two novel modifications of GAC glycans: glycerol
phosphate modification of GAC and de-N-acetylation of the GAC linkage unit. The goal of this
proposal is to characterize the mechanisms of GAC biosynthesis and modification, and
elucidate the roles of cell wall modifications in antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and GAS
pathogenesis. To help answer these questions we will employ a variety of genetic, biochemical,
analytical and structural approaches. The function of cell wall modifications in GAS
pathogenesis will be studied in ex vivo and in vivo models of GAS infection. The proposed
studies provide a platform for design of a safe and effective vaccine against this important
human pathogen and should have broad application to other streptococci which express similar
cell wall polysaccharides. Since the enzymes of the GAC biosynthesis pathway are attractive
drug targets, the proposed studies will have important implications for drug design."
10910121,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common cause of spinal injury in patients
over 55 years of age. It has a profound health care impact, leading to more than 100,000 operations a
year and upwards of $2 billion in health care expenditure. Unfortunately, traditional cervical spine MRI
techniques are imperfect predictors of ongoing spinal injury and cannot predict which patients will
respond well to intervention. Further, there is a critical gap in our understanding of how the spinal cord
is injured during ongoing degenerative compression. The application of new imaging technologies may
help close this gap. Our previous work, during K23 studies, has shown the utility of both white matter
(WM) imaging markers and spinal cord morphometrics for monitoring ongoing injury as well as
predicting recovery. The development of tract-specific WM imaging methods, as proposed in this work,
may aid in translating these findings to clinical care. Further, our work shows the volume of the cervical
cord gray matter (GM) is decreased in DCM. Utilizing a novel spinal cord fMRI methodology, we have
additionally seen decreased GM activation in DCM patients, a change that associates with patient
symptoms. These findings challenge the traditional view that DCM is a disease primarily of the WM. An
objective of our proposed studies is to utilize a newly developed Consensus spine imaging protocol to
substantiate the role of WM markers in tracking spinal injury, a critical next step in the translation of
these imaging results. Further, we develop a new fMRI methodology that is used to show that GM
activity is decreased in the injured cord. Our central hypothesis is that while markers of WM injury are
the leading predictor of symptoms of neural injury in DCM patients, GM injury also plays a key role in
each patient’s clinical symptoms. We will test this hypothesis by developing new tract specific markers
and novel spinal fMRI methodology. Building upon our previous experience, we will compare the
alterations of both WM and GM markers in these patients, with the goal of enhancing our ability to
accurately predict both ongoing injury and early recovery after surgery. These findings will have a
significant positive impact on human health by providing new understanding of the drivers of spinal
injury in degenerative cervical compressive disease and developing new markers of injury that may
enhance our ability to monitor and treat injury as well as prognosticate recovery."
10916424,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are the universal adaptor molecules necessary to convert the nucleic acid-based genetic
code into protein sequence during protein synthesis (translation) by the ribosome. This process is universally
conserved and fundamental to all life, and, as such, defects in the molecular players of translation, including
tRNAs, result in diverse human diseases. Specific chemical modifications such as methylation are common in
tRNA, but a detailed understanding of the enzymes that incorporate them and their contributions to tRNA function
(and disfunction in disease) have only recently emerged for a few select examples. Since the discovery of the
tRNA methyltransferase (Trm10) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an accumulating body of evidence, including
phenotypes in yeast and a multisymptomatic disease associated with human mutations, has established a
significant role for Trm10 in tRNA biology. To better understand the implications of Trm10 modification, the
mechanisms by which Trm10 family enzymes specifically recognize and act on their substrate tRNA, and the
impact of tRNA modifications on important cellular processes need to be addressed. This project will determine
the molecular basis for Trm10 mechanism and function using a multi-disciplinary approach. Genetic, biochemical
and molecular enzymology approaches will be combined with structural analyses of enzyme-tRNA complexes
using synthetic analogs of the native methyl donor, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, to uniquely identify the role of
Trm10 in the maintenance of a high-quality pool of tRNA. A newly developed vertebrate model for Trm10 function
will enable investigation of previously challenging questions on Trm10's role in the biological function of
multicellular eukaryotes. The studies will be performed in three complementary but independent aims that will:
1) Determine how specific tRNA substrates are selected for modification by yeast and vertebrate Trm10 enzymes
using structural, biochemical and genetic approaches; 2) Assess the molecular basis for and biological
significance of the uniquely conserved vertebrate m1A9 modification exploiting a new vertebrate model for Trm10
function, and 3) Identify tRNA-specific functions for G9 modification in yeast and zebrafish using complementary
genetic approaches in both model species. Collectively, the proposed studies will advance the fields of
enzymology, RNA biochemistry, and tRNA biology by providing mechanistic and biological insight into a tRNA
modification enzyme that is universally conserved among eukaryotes and is critically important for human health,
yet whose molecular mechanism and biological functions are not at all understood. These results will also provide
new insight into the dynamic landscape of tRNA modifications in multicellular eukaryotes."

 Major hallmarks of aging and neurodegeneration include cognitive decline, altered body composition,
dysregulation of circadian rhythms, and changes in neuroendocrine systems. The hypothalamus is the brain
region that harbors a diversity of neuronal subtypes that coordinate these important functions. Yet, the extent to
which changes in the hypothalamus underlie functional decline in normal aging and neurodegeneration is not
well understood. Intriguingly, interventions targeting the hypothalamus can significantly extend lifespan in mice,
with a discrepancy in females versus males. Moreover, alterations in sleep and body weight can occur prior to
the onset of neurodegeneration, for example in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). One challenge in understanding the
aging process is that it is highly heterogeneous, meaning that different cell-types age differently. For example,
in brain aging, within individuals, the immune cells (microglia) age very differently from neurons. Moreover,
across individuals, women are more susceptible to age-associated neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than men. However, the selective vulnerability of different cell-types in the brain in
aging and AD, and the cell-type specific mechanism underlying female bias in brain aging are largely unknown.
 For the F99 phase of this proposal, in Dr. Webb’s laboratory at Brown University, I will build on my
foundational work in which I defined the cell-type transcriptional changes that occur in the aging female mouse
hypothalamus. I will perform machine learning analysis to identify signatures of cell vulnerability and resilience
with age and extend this work to a model of neurodegeneration (AD mouse models and human post-mortem
tissue). Understanding the selective vulnerability in aging and AD can help develop precise interventions to
specifically target the vulnerable neurons to slow down brain aging and promote health span.
 For the K00 phase of this proposal, I will seek to understand the epigenetic mechanisms regulating
sex-differences in brain aging. My previous analysis found increased expression of Xist, the master regulator
for silencing one of the two chrX in females in eutherian mammals, in aging and AD brain. Given that chrX is
enriched for neural and immune genes and the known loss of heterochromatin in aging, I hypothesize that Xist
is required for maintaining chrX silencing to protect neurons in brain aging. I will test this hypothesis by
epigenetically activating or silencing Xist in induced neurons derived from aged fibroblasts to determine the
impact on neuronal aging, and in vivo to reveal the cell-type specific response to the chrX-specific perturbation.
 This work will contribute to the understanding of the heterogeneity, especially cell-type specific and
sex-specific vulnerability, in normal brain aging and AD. Further, it will lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers
to assess age and AD status at single cell resolution, which will contribute to the development of cell-type
specific interventions. To successfully complete these goals, I will gain extensive training from a team of
experts in computational biology, biology of aging, neurodegeneration, and neuroscience."

 We aim to answer the signature question of paramedic care; “What is the best way to manage the
prehospital airway in critically ill children?” Cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and major trauma are
devastating critical conditions in children. Resuscitation from critical illness requires skillful airway
management to optimize delivery of oxygen to the lungs, preventing irreparable damage to the brain and
heart. As the first to provide critical care, prehospital paramedics often perform life-saving airway management
on critically ill children. The most common prehospital airway management techniques (bag-valve-mask
ventilation (BVM), endotracheal intubation (ETI), and supraglottic airway insertion (SGA) have important trade-
offs between risks and benefits; the best approach is unknown.
 We propose the novel Pediatric Prehospital Airway Resuscitation Trial (Pedi-PART) to determine
the best strategies for prehospital airway management in critically ill children. Pedi-PART will
immediately influence paramedic practices and have a lasting impact upon the health of children
internationally. We will determine the relative effectiveness of three airway strategies ([BVM-only], [BVM+ETI],
[BVM+SGA]), accounting for variations across disease (cardiac arrest, trauma, respiratory failure) and age
categories, and we will apply adaptive techniques to minimize the required number of patients. Our aims are:
 AIM I: Prepare the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) to execute the
innovative Pedi-PART trial. PECARN is the nation’s premier pediatric emergencies research network. We
have assembled an alliance of over 60 EMS agencies from 10 communities associated with PECARN and their
ongoing Pediatric Dose Optimization for Seizures in EMS trial (PediDOSE - U01-NS114042).
 AIM II: Compare the effectiveness of prehospital BVM, SGA, and ETI airway management strategies
upon pediatric cardiac arrest, major trauma, and respiratory failure outcomes. We will execute the trial in
two sequential stages. Stage I: Determine if [BVM-only] or [BVM followed by SGA] results in better ICU-free
survival in critically ill children with cardiac arrest, major trauma, or respiratory failure. Stage II: Determine if
[winner of Stage I] or [BVM followed by ETI] results in better ICU-free survival.
 AIM III: Compare the safety of prehospital BVM, SGA, and ETI airway management strategies in
pediatric cardiac arrest, major trauma, and respiratory failure. In Stage I, we will determine if [BVM+SGA]
results in fewer prehospital and hospital adverse events compared with [BVM-only] in critically ill children with
cardiac arrest, major trauma, or respiratory failure. In Stage II, we will determine if the winner of Stage I results
in fewer adverse events compared with [BVM+ETI]."

Despite progress in providing comprehensive prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV
(PMTCT) services, significant gaps in the timely uptake and provision of guideline-adherent
services and maternal retention in care remain. Such gaps create missed opportunities for
preventing mother-to-child transmission and result in nearly 6,100 infants becoming infected
with HIV each year in Kenya. Effective interventions that routinize the delivery of evidence-
based PMTCT services and foster consistent patient engagement are essential to close the
remaining gaps and eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Building off of a successful
R34 grant to develop and pilot test the HITSystem 2.0, an eHealth intervention targeting PMTCT
services, the overall goal of this proposal is to use a cluster randomized control design at 12
Kenyan government hospitals to evaluate a modified HITSystem 2.1 intervention. HITSystem
2.1 reflects the 2018 Kenyan PMTCT guidelines, including routine viral load monitoring and
interventions to suppress maternal viral load. We aim to evaluate the impact of HITSystem 2.1
to optimize the provision of guideline-adherent services and viral suppression through the
antenatal, delivery, and early postpartum periods. Aim 1 of the proposed study will assess the
efficacy of the HITSystem 2.1 to increase the proportion of mothers who receive complete
PMTCT services (including appointment attendance, medication adherence support, viral load
testing, hospital-based delivery, and infant testing per Kenyan National Guidelines) through 6
months postpartum. We hypothesize that mothers receiving the HITSystem 2.1 intervention will
have a significantly higher completion rate for guideline-adherence PMTCT services compared
to mothers receiving standard of care PMTCT services. In Aim 1b, we will evaluate HITSystem
2.1 implementation using the RE-AIM model to inform sustainable scale up. Aim 2 will assess
the efficacy of HITSystem 2.1 to increase viral suppression (<1,000 copies/mL) among pregnant
and postpartum women, including those who disengage from care. We hypothesize that
mothers at HITSystem 2.1 sites will have higher rates of viral suppression at delivery and 6
months postpartum. Aim 3 will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HITSystem 2.1. Driven by
differences in PMTCT retention, viral suppression, and modeled estimates of pediatric HIV
infections averted, we hypothesize that the HITSystem 2.1 will be cost-effective, based on
World Health Organization criteria. This proposal is aimed at improving the quality of PMTCT
services in the health facility setting. If efficacious and cost-effective, HITSystem 2.1 holds
strong promise for national dissemination."

Infections during pregnancy or the neonatal period account for more than two million deaths globally each year.
Frequently, the pathogens causing these infections begin as residents of the maternal vaginal microbiota and
ascend to the uterus during pregnancy. One such pathogen, group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a leading agent
neonatal morbidity and mortality, yet the factors driving GBS ascension into the uterus are poorly defined. The
current standard of care, antibiotic prophylaxis to GBS-positive mothers, is insufficient to prevent GBS-
associated preterm births of stillbirths and exposes ~1 million U.S. infants to antibiotics each year. Understanding
the biological principles controlling GBS-host dynamics is critical to developing defined, long-lasting preventions
for GBS infections in pregnancy and the early neonatal period. Clinical studies have identified gestational
diabetes mellitus (GDM) as a key risk factor for maternal colonization and neonatal disease. The objective of
this proposal is to interrogate the contribution of maternal immunity and GBS transcriptional adaptions in the
propagation of GDM-associated invasive GBS disease and adverse birth outcomes. Our preliminary murine
studies show enhanced susceptibility of diabetic mice to GBS fetal dissemination and adverse outcomes, altered
cytokine profiles, and differential GBS gene expression in a novel murine GDM model. We hypothesize that
GDM renders the host more susceptible to GBS by perturbing maternal immunity and altering GBS transcription
to enhance virulence and fitness. This hypothesis will be interrogated through specific aims designed to
determine: 1) the impact of GDM on the maternal and fetal immune responses at baseline and during GBS
ascending infection, and 2) the transcriptional adaptions required for GBS pathogenesis in the pregnant host in
the presence or absence of GDM. These aims are advanced using multiple innovative tools including recently
established murine models of GDM and GBS vaginal colonization, immune profiling across maternal and fetal
tissues, and comparative GBS transcriptional analyses from commensal and invasive niches. This research
takes place in the dynamic and interdisciplinary environment of Baylor College of Medicine and the Texas
Medical Center with diverse expertise in GBS-host interactions of the female reproductive tract, employment of
animal models to study gestational diabetes mellitus, and genetics of Streptococcal pathogenesis. This research
strategy seeks to more fully understand the complex processes governing host and pathogen dynamics in the
context of pregnancy and maternal metabolic disease. These studies will launch mechanistic studies into key
pathways dictating pregnancy outcomes, and will inform new therapeutic strategies for detecting and preventing
GBS infections in both healthy women and those with gestational diabetes."

Head and Neck Cancer is a public health concern in the United States and a major challenge in oncology.
Chemoradiotherapy has been mainly adopted to improve survival for patients with head and neck cancers.
However, the benefit remains limited to patients with a high risk of complications, and the burden of toxicity
in surviving patients with head and neck cancers is severe. Hyperthermia combined with other treatments,
such as radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, has been shown in clinical trials to increase response
for head and neck cancers, but success is highly dependent upon the delivered thermal dose distributions.
Hence, this technology requires spatially controllable heat delivery and adequate temperature monitoring.
MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) can potentially be used to deliver hyperthermia. The focused
ultrasound technique has been received much interest due to its completely non-invasive heat delivery with
a high degree of spatial selectivity and dynamic control. With these inherent advantages, clinical MRgFUS
systems have been developed and approved for thermal ablation treatments of various sites, such as the
brain, uterine fibroids, prostate, pancreas, and bone metastases. However, the major technical challenges
remain for MRgFUS hyperthermia delivery to head and neck cancers: There is a need for 1) optimizing
sonication strategies for enhancing temperature distributions and delivering conformal hyperthermia to HNC,
and 2) advanced MR imaging methods for accurate temperature imaging with significantly reduced artifacts
and rapid MR imaging to evaluate tissue response. The proposed project will develop methods for more
effective hyperthermia delivery under magnetic resonance imaging control to increase response rate and
survival for patients with superficial and deep tumors in the head and neck, such as squamous cell carcinoma,
melanoma, and soft tissue sarcoma. In this project, the specific aims are 1) to develop practical and optimal
sonication strategies for conformal delivery of hyperthermia to target head and neck cancer, 2) develop
robust real-time MR thermometry methods for temperature imaging with a minimal artifact in the complex
anatomy of the head and neck, and 3) develop real-time simultaneous MR imaging of temperature and tissue
response during hyperthermia (R00 Phase). These technical developments will advance MRgFUS-mediated
hyperthermia delivery to head and neck cancers and the training plan includes opportunities to apply the
new knowledge. I have assembled an outstanding team of renowned mentors (Drs. Diederich, Larson, and
Payne) and specialized advisors (Drs. Ozhinsky, Bucknor, and Chan) with expertise in MR-guided Focused
Ultrasound therapy, clinical head and neck cancer treatment, quantitative MRI, and MR thermometry. The
proposed award will provide me with the necessary experiences to become an independent, transdisciplinary,
and translational scientist dedicated to image-guided thermal therapy and therapeutic ultrasound."

Dr. Egan is a physician trained in clinical endocrinology and will undertake a four-year mentored research and
career development program in the pathophysiology of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at Mayo Clinic. She
will complete a master’s degree in Clinical and Translational Science, gain experience in the conduct of in vivo
studies in an obstetric population, acquire new skills in analysis and modeling of human physiological data, and
develop scientific leadership skills and collaborative relationships. These activities will fill current gaps in
knowledge and allow Dr. Egan to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Egan will be guided by a team
of prominent researchers with relevant areas of expertise and an excellent track record in mentoring young
faculty. This team will be led by her primary mentor, Dr Adrian Vella, whose research focuses on the
pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). GDM is a common pregnancy complication and while the
associated hyperglycemia resolves postpartum, it is a strong risk factor for T2DM. There is little understanding
of maternal β-cell function in early pregnancy, how this may predict GDM in later pregnancy, and what changes
occur postpartum. Dr. Egan’s preliminary data suggest that α-cell function also changes during pregnancy, but
its role in GDM development and postpartum glucose tolerance is unknown. In the proposed in vivo studies, Dr.
Egan will determine the degree of β-cell (Aim 1) and α-cell (Aim 2) dysfunction needed to produce GDM and
examine the islet cell recovery (or lack thereof) that occurs postpartum. Dr. Egan will assess if GDM can be
predicted earlier in pregnancy which would facilitate more timely intervention. She will also identify the residual
defects in glucose metabolism that persist at one year postpartum. Such defects could contribute to the
accelerated progression to T2DM observed in women with GDM (Aim 3). To accomplish these aims, Dr. Egan
will study women during pregnancy and post-partum using state-of-the-art, non-invasive techniques to collect
and examine detailed physiologic data. In keeping with the NIDDK mission, the proposed studies will address
important aspects of diabetes development in women and provide the foundation for a future R01 application
with the goal of developing novel diabetes prevention and treatment approaches."
10740854,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Maternal social anxiety is associated with child social anxiety, suggesting that mothers transmit social anxiety
to their children. One pathway to explain this transmission is through children’s social learning from their
mothers. Late childhood is an important period for the onset of social anxiety and social anxiety emerging
during this period is associated with adverse life outcomes. Thus, there is critical need to understand the social
processes through which children acquire social anxiety from their mothers during this period. Children may
acquire social anxiety as a result of attending to their mothers’ negative verbal communication regarding social
situations. Our preliminary findings provided support for this hypothesis showing that maternal negative verbal
communication mediates the transmission of social fear from mothers to children. However, how maternal
social anxiety shapes the moment-to-moment dynamics of mother-child communication regarding fear-relevant
stimuli is largely unknown. More socially anxious mothers may transmit social anxiety to their children through
negative verbal communication and/or by facilitating a rigid dyadic interaction pattern during which children
attend to negative social input for extensive durations. This project’s aims are to (a) examine whether maternal
negative verbal communication mediates the influence of maternal social anxiety on children’s laboratory-
based social fear, (b) examine whether mother-child dyadic rigidity (i.e., perseveration in child attending to
negative maternal input) mediates the influence of maternal social anxiety on children’s laboratory-based social
fear, (c) examine the mediating roles of maternal negative verbal communication and dyadic rigidity in the
association between maternal social anxiety and child social anxiety 6 months later. One hundred 9-12-year-
old children and their mothers will participate in one laboratory visit and complete questionnaires 2-weeks
before and 6 months after this visit. During the visit, dyads will complete a mother-child social interaction task
during which mothers will talk about two hypothetical peers with their children. Prior to this task, mothers will
receive positive information regarding one peer and negative information regarding the other peer. Mothers will
be instructed to show the pictures of these peers during conversations. Child participants will wear comfortable
mobile eye-tracking glasses and their visual attention to the two peer pictures and their mother’s face will be
tracked during the conversations. Child attention to maternal positive and negative social input will be
examined using a dynamic systems method (i.e., state space grids). Upon completion of this project, I will have
tested two possible mechanisms by which mothers may transmit social anxiety to their children. The proposed
study will make a significant contribution to the scientific knowledge on how mothers transfer social anxiety to
their children and may provide a novel target for family-based interventions. I will also receive in-depth training
in (a) theories and methods of dynamic systems approaches, (b) use of mobile eye-tracking in the context of
dynamic social interactions and (c) interventions used in the prevention of childhood anxiety problems."
10927425,"ABSTRACT
Suicide is a top ten cause of mortality in the United States, and suicide rates have increased dramatically in
recent decades. A recent meta-analysis showed that the suicide rate following discharge from a psychiatric
facility was 2,078 per 100,000 person-years (versus 14.0 for the general population). Approximately one-
quarter of all suicide deaths occur within 3 months of discharge from a psychiatric facility, making this a period
of extremely high risk.
 With the advent of managed care in the 1990s and the concomitant decrease in hospital lengths of
stay, Intensive Outpatient Programs/Partial Hospitalization Programs (IOP/PHPs) were instituted to manage
high-risk patients outside of a locked hospital unit. Today, IOP/PHP services are frequently used in some areas
as the principal discharge plan for patients upon leaving the hospital. However, there is virtually no evidence
examining their clinical effects on suicide risk in this period. While these IOP/PHP services are readily available
in some areas of the country, they are virtually non-existent in other regions. If IOP/PHP services have a
significant protective effect against suicide following hospital discharge, implementation initiatives to broaden
the availability of these services nationwide could be undertaken as a way to bend the curve against suicide.
 We hypothesize that the intense social and psychological support of IOP/PHPs will be reflected in a
reduction in suicide risk among patients who receive treatment through these programs. We will test this
hypothesis by conducting a propensity score matched observational study of patients who receive treatment at
IOP/PHP services following discharge compared to patients who receive non-intensive outpatient follow-up.
Cohorts for these groups will be sufficiently large (over 100,000 per group) to detect even small differences in
suicide rates between intervention groups (minimum detectable rate ratio ranging from 0.82 to 0.95, see Table
4). The data for this project will be drawn from Medicaid databases and will be linked with the National Death
Index, the most authoritative data source for mortality in the United States.
 Additionally, we will conduct a national survey of clinical directors of IOP/PHP services to identify and
characterize clinical care processes. Survey results will be integrated with claims-based analyses to better
understand what care processes may be effective in reducing suicide risk following hospital discharge as well
as to understand the variations in quality of care throughout the country among IOP/PHP services.
 Results from this project would have important implications for policy and discharge planning patterns
in the post-hospitalization period. Future directions would include dissemination and implementation initiatives
to align discharge planning patterns with clinical evidence. A stakeholder council will be formed during the
project to help implement strategies to enhance the availability of these services in locations where they are
not widely accessible."

This proposal requests support for my position as the Director of the Cancer Metabolism Core at Sanford
Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute (SBP). The Core is part of the NCI-designated Cancer Center at
SBP. Dr. Ze’ev Ronai, with whom I have worked for thirteen years, is the Cancer Center Director and the Unit
Director for this application. The Core supports cancer research by providing a GC-MS-based stable-isotope
(13C) metabolite tracing and quantification service. I have worked at SBP on stable-isotope tracer technology
since 2008, first in a research lab and for the last six years in the Cancer Metabolism Core. I have developed
assays using differing derivatization protocols and MS ionization approaches for polar metabolites, fatty acids
(long- and short-chain), cholesterol, sugars and sugar-phosphates, including methods for metabolite
quantification and quality control. In the past five years, the Core has contributed to at least 18 papers from labs
with NCI project grant support, and I have been a co-author on 13 of these papers. I describe plans in this
application for continued expansion of stable isotope tracing methods and metabolite quantification using a
newly-acquired GC-MS/MS that will improve detection sensitivity both through the triple quad technology and by
being easier to use with chemical ionization. I also plan to work on specific methods needed for cancer research,
including for bile acids, oxysterols, hexosamine pathway intermediates, and methods for isolated cell populations
and organelle metabolomics. Funding from this R50 award will further allow me to work on the development of
targeted LC-MS assays for metabolites that cannot be measured using GC-MS. By strengthening facilities for
analysis of altered metabolic states within cancer cells and tumors, this award will advance the goal of excellence
in translational multi-disciplinary research in the SBP Cancer Center."
10726582,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a highly disabling neurological disease affecting veterans, characterized by
demyelination, inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration. Current medications available for treating MS
are only partially effective as they specifically target the inflammatory phase, but not the neurodegenerative
phase, and therefore have limited effects on long-term disability. Increasing evidences suggest that
neurodegeneration plays a crucial role in the MS pathology. However, the mechanisms underlying the
progressive neurodegeneration are poorly studied in MS. Hence, there is a great need for identifying new agents
that target the neurodegenerative stage of the disease. Our goal is to contribute to the treatment of MS, by
defining the specific role of Spermine Oxidase (SMOX, an important enzyme in polyamine metabolic pathway),
in mediating neurodegeneration in the MS retina and by demonstrating its potential as a therapeutic target for
MS treatment. Our central hypothesis is that SMOX is upregulated in retinal neurons, resulting in increased
polyamine oxidation and release of acrolein in the MS retina. Our hypothesis predicts that formation of various
protein-acrolein adducts causes oxidative damage in the retina, leading to neuronal dysfunction. Our objectives
are: 1) characterize molecular mechanisms involved in SMOX-induced neuronal damage in the experimental
model for MS; 2) determine the impact of SMOX overexpression/downregulation in mediating neurodegeneration
in the experimental model of MS; and 3) determine the therapeutic potential of inhibiting SMOX for the treatment
of MS. Our expected outcomes include 1) identification of SMOX induced molecular changes by which
neuronal damage occurs in MS; 2) demonstration of alterations in retinal neuronal survival and function in
response to manipulation of SMOX expression in the experimental model; and 3) preservation of visual acuity,
contrast sensitivity, retinal structure and reduced inflammation in response to SMOX blockade. Our studies will
impact the field of MS by providing new and significant information on mechanisms by which neurodegeneration
occurs in MS, and thus can lead to the development of accurate and efficacious targeted therapies to improve
the quality of life in veterans affected by the disease. Results coming out these studies may provide translational
strategies for MS disease progression and can also be applicable to cognitive, behavioral and motor deficits in
MS patients. Retina is known as “window to the brain” and hence targeting SMOX function has the potential to
be evaluated as therapy for MS in general and is also applicable to other disabling diseases affecting veterans
such as Traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s disease and spinal cord injury."
10726583,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating human neurodegenerative disorder that is
manifested in the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. ALS has higher incidence in U.S. military
Veterans than in the general population and is considered a service-connected condition. Understanding the
biological basis of ALS remains a major challenge, which is largely due to the complexity of the human central
nervous system, which contain vast numbers of specialized cell types. Whereas the original focus of ALS
research was concentrated on motor neurons, the non-neuronal cell types have also been suggested to play a
crucial role in motor neuron death. Previous studies used genome-wide analysis of gene expression in bulk
brain tissues to assess transcriptional changes associated with ALS. However, information on key changes that
could affect different cell types in ALS brain remains limited. One reason is that changes affecting a particular
cell type cannot be reliably inferred from data on bulk brain specimens that conflate signals from all cell types.
 The majority of ALS cases (~90%) occur sporadically (sALS) with unknown etiology, while ~10% of cases
are classified as familial (fALS). To date, mutations in more than 50 genes have been linked to fALS. Expansion
of the hexanucleotide repeat in C9orf72 (C9) gene is the most common cause of ALS and another
neurodegenerative disorder, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), accounting for ~ 11% of all ALS and ~13% of all
FTD cases. We recently performed single nucleus (sn)RNA-seq analysis using autopsied motor and prefrontal
cortices from ALS and FTD cases with a C9 mutation and from controls. We identified disease-related changes
in many cell types, including shared effects in ALS and FTD, and numerous disease-specific alterations. Among
other findings, we detected changes in gene expression in endothelial cells, astrocytes, and excitatory neurons
from C9-ALS cases that suggest a specific intercellular pathway that might, at least in part, underlie an ALS-
associated glutamate (Glu) excitotoxicity. Our application aims to address the following issues: (1) Our snRNA-
seq studies were limited to C9 cases; therefore, it is not known if the observed cell-type-dependent deficits are
specific for C9-ALS or are also present in patients with sALS. (2) Although ALS typically leads to death within 3
to 5 years after initial symptom onset, approximately 10% of patients with ALS live significantly longer (>10 years
after symptom onset; hereafter named “long duration ALS”) [10]. The molecular underpinnings of these
differences have not been investigated. To address these issues, we propose the following Aims:
Aim 1: To study cell-type-specific transcriptional dysregulation in the brains of U.S. military Veterans
with sALS in single cell resolution. Hypothesis: Transcriptional deficits that we identified in C9-ALS patients
and which, at least in part, explain the ALS-associated Glu excitotoxicity, are also present in the brain of military
Veterans with sALS. We will test this hypothesis by performing snRNA-seq in the brains of standard duration
sALS cases and controls (Ns=24) from the Department of Veterans Affairs Biorepository Brain Bank (VABBB).
Aim 2: To elucidate cell-type-specific underpinnings of the long duration sALS phenotype. Hypothesis:
Compared with standard duration sALS, long duration sALS is characterized by both unique and overlapping
neurotoxic pathways. We will test this hypothesis by performing snRNA-seq in long duration sALS cases from
VBBB (N=24) and comparing transcriptomes between standard (Aim1) and long duration sALS.
Aim 3: To validate sALS-associated deficits in major cortical cell types. 3a. We will employ our novel
nuclear sorting protocol to isolate nuclei from four major brain cell types (neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes,
and microglia) from the sister aliquots of samples used in Aims 1-2. We will use these preparations to validate
the most significant snRNA-seq findings by qPCR. 3b. RNA-seq studies do not inform if the identified gene
expression changes translate into changes in proteins. Here we will use immunostaining to investigate proteins
encoded by sALS-associated genes from Aims1-2 that will have been validated in Aim3a."
10726584,"ABSTRACT
Neurodegenerative disease is a major cause of death and permanent disability in Veterans;
vascular disease of the brain plays an outsized role in the progression of neurodegenerative
diseases including Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). On its own, vascular
disease of the brain can cause one form of ADRD, vascular cognitive impairment and dementia
(VCID). In collaboration with disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, brain vascular disease
significantly augments the pace and severity of dementing disorders. Unfortunately, effective
treatments that target vascular disease of the brain are currently not available. As such, there
is an unmet need to uncover the molecular mechanisms of brain vascular disease. The most
common inherited cause of brain vascular disease is cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy
with subcortical infarcts and dementia (CADASIL). CADASIL is an outstanding model for
understanding pathology of brain blood vessels and is caused by mutations in NOTCH3 that are
predicted to alter cysteine number. We have discovered a sequence of changes in the
configuration of NOTCH3 in association with CADASIL mutations. First, NOTCH3 in CADASIL
is more likely to harbor multiple reduced cysteines (a form called mrc-N3). Second, NOTCH3
that is multiply reduced undergoes cleavage at the N-terminus that releases a 41-amino acid
peptide, the NOTCH3 N-terminal fragment (NTF). Based on the molecular process driving NTF
generation, in new experiments, we describe the identification of a second cleavage event that
is predicted to result in a second 41-amino acid peptide NTF2. Antibodies generated to NTF2
demonstrate that CADASIL vessels are enriched in this cleavage product. Moreover, a novel
monoclonal antibody has been identified that recognizes a conformation of NTF2 that is only
expressed in a subset of vessels (NTF2*). In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that
NTF2* is associated with advanced pathology of CADASIL blood vessels. We will also test if
NTF2* is deposited in a gradient from the surface to the deep white matter, which would point to
the possibility that NTF2* is a predictable marker for vascular disease progression."

My major research focus is to understand the fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation and function in the
development of cardiovascular disease, a major health burden for our veterans. Our overarching goals are to
translate the findings into identification of novel molecular targets and strategies for prevention and intervention
of cardiovascular disease. We have been studying the molecular regulation of vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMC) phenotypic transitions, which should provide new insights into the understanding of the development of
atherosclerosis, diabetic vasculopathy and vascular aging. Using novel tissue-specific gene knockout mouse
models, we have uncovered an essential role of the osteogenic transcription factor Runx2 in regulating VSMC
reprogramming into bone-like cells, leading to the pathogenesis of vascular calcification and stiffness in animal
models of atherosclerosis and diabetes. We have also uncovered novel mechanisms underlying Runx2
upregulation in the vasculature by increased oxidative stress and hyperglycemia; and discovered a Runx2-
dependent crosstalk between VSMC, macrophages and vascular stem cells in the development of
atherosclerotic calcification. With these innovative research programs, I have been able to provide training and
mentoring to many graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior scientists and physicians at the
Birmingham VAMC and affiliated University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Our efforts to investigate the
underlying mechanisms and identify targets for cardiovascular disease have brought together increasing
numbers of physician scientists and basic scientists at the Birmingham VA medical center and UAB, which led
to the development of a VA-funded Program Project Award and three of my Merit Review Awards, including the
exciting and highly VA-related research “Molecular Regulation of Vascular Calcification in Diabetes” (2019-
2023). In addition, our collaborative research projects on the regulation of VSMC function in atherosclerosis,
diabetes and vascular aging have also been supported by several R01 grants from the National Institutes of
Health. These ongoing investigations will not only elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the
pathogenesis of vascular disease and aging, but also provide novel molecular insights facilitating further studies
to translate these findings into therapeutic strategies for patient care, so as to improve the veterans’ health, life
span and quality of life, as well as reduce healthcare costs."
10726597,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are present throughout the arterial tree and play a central role in
cardiovascular physiology by regulating blood pressure and flow. Cardiovascular aging is characterized by
pathologic changes in SMCs that contribute in a major way to high-burden diseases affecting US veterans,
including hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Two
important phenotypic changes that occur in SMCs with aging are 1) stiffening, which produces hypertension
and increases cardiac afterload, and 2) senescence, which is functionally defined as arrest of cell division and
assumption of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a driver of vascular inflammation and
fibrosis. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a member of the serpin superfamily of protease inhibitors, is
the primary inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase (u-PA) and an important
regulator of proteolysis and cell adhesion. PAI-1 expression increases with age and is associated with
vascular fibrosis and generalized cell senescence. However, the specific effects of PAI-1 on SMC stiffening
and senescence, as well as the mechanisms underlying them, are poorly understood. In preliminary studies
involving pharmacologic and genetic modulation of PAI-1 expression in SMCs, we have shown that drug
targeting of PAI-1 decreases SMC stiffness, assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), while also
decreasing SMC cytoskeleton formation and enhancing activation of cofilin, which degrades filamentous (F)-
actin. We also have demonstrated that PAI-1 promotes SMC senescence by a pathway involving the LDL
receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), while also dampening mitochondrial respiratory fitness, which is strongly
linked to cell senescence. We have performed an RNA-sequencing analysis that has identified candidate
signaling pathways mediating PAI-1’s effects on SMC stiffness and senescence. We also have generated
mice with conditional knockout of PAI-1 in SMCs, which will enable us to study the significance of our findings
in vivo. Based on our extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that PAI-1 1) regulates SMC stiffness by
controlling actin, myosin, and focal adhesion assembly in the cytoskeleton, and 2) promotes SMC senescence
through adverse effects on mitochondrial energy substrate utilization and reactive oxygen species accrual. To
test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: 1) identify the intracellular signaling pathways
by which PAI-1 regulates SMC stress fiber formation and stiffness, 2) determine the role of PAI-1 in regulating
mitochondrial substrate utilization and reactive oxygen species accumulation in SMCs, probing underlying
mechanisms, and 3) study the effects of pharmacologic and SMC-specific inhibition of PAI-1 on arterial
stiffness and senescence in vivo. Several innovative strategies will be employed, including 1) AFM, 2)
confocal fluorescence microscopy, 3) quantitative studies of PAI-1’s effects of F-actin, myosin, and focal
adhesion assembly, 4) measurement of mitochondrial energy substrate utilization and membrane potential,
and 5) novel murine models that enable quantification of the effects of systemic inhibition and SMC-specific
deletion of PAI-1 on vascular stiffening and senescence in vivo. The experiments will be carried out by a
highly experienced, multi-disciplinary team of scientists from the Truman VA Hospital, the University of
Missouri School of Medicine, and the Dalton Cardiovascular Research Center. The significance of the
proposed work is that it will 1) identify mechanisms by which PAI-1 and its pharmacological inhibition regulate
key degenerative changes that occur in SMCs with aging, namely stiffening and senescence, and 2) translate
these findings to the in vivo setting. The proposed experiments will yield important new information about the
roles of PAI-1 and SMCs in vascular aging that are directly relevant to major cardiovascular diseases affecting
the US veteran population. The studies also have great potential for transition to the clinical setting through
the use of pharmacologic PAI-1 inhibitors."
10726598,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), usually caused by cigarette smoking, is rising in prevalence
and is predicted to become the leading cause of death worldwide by mid-century. Available treatments provide
only short-term benefit, and fail to stop COPD’s inexorable progression. Even smoking cessation, after the
earliest stages, provides limited benefit. New mechanistic therapies to halt progression are thus urgently
needed. COPD pathophysiology includes bronchial inflammation and remodeling, combined with septal
destruction/emphysema driven by inflammation-associated oxidative stress and protease secretion.
Inflammation-driven apoptosis of airway epithelial cells (AECs) is also thought to contribute to airway
remodeling. Based on promising preliminary findings, the proposed research will test the novel hypothesis that
agonist activation of the orphan nuclear hormone receptor Nur77 may have beneficial effects in COPD.
Preliminary findings revealed that AECs and lungs of COPD patients and also lungs of mice with cigarette
smoke (CS)-induced COPD exhibit marked downregulation of Nur77 expression. We also found that Nur77
knockout (KO) exacerbates CS-induced inflammation and lung damage in mice, suggesting a protective role of
endogenous Nur77. We tested the effects of treatment with the classical Nur77 agonist cytosporone B and
found it ameliorated CS-induced lung damage and inflammation in mice, leading us to hypothesize that Nur77
agonists may be useful in COPD therapy. Our in silico findings show that Nur77 exhibits dual (classical and
alternate) ligand binding sites. No alternate site ligand had been identified, but to assess any potential
beneficial effects of activating it we used in silico modeling to identify a novel compound that in vitro studies
demonstrated binds to the Nur77 alternate site, and found that it is an agonist that activates Nur77
transcriptional activity more effectively than cytosporone B. CS extract in vitro causes AECs and type ll
pulmonary ECs to become apoptotic, a pathway that potentially contributes to COPD. Nur77 localization to
mitochondria is known to trigger apoptosis, leading us to hypothesize that CS extract is inducing movement of
Nur77 from the nucleus to cytoplasm and thence to the mitochondria. Our preliminary data show that our novel
alternate site Nur77 agonist reverses such COPD-associated cytoplasmic localization by anchoring Nur77 to
its target response elements in the nucleus, thus ameliorating inflammation and apoptosis of lung ECs. Based
on these novel findings, the aims are to: 1: Determine whether endogenous suppression of nuclear and total
Nur77 activity that occurs in COPD promotes disease progression and severity. 2: Test if activating Nur77
ameliorates COPD severity and progression and its contributing lung EC apoptosis. We will achieve these
aims by treating human AECs of healthy controls and COPD patients in vitro with our novel, effective Nur77
agonist, and testing its effects in mice ± transgenic global or AEC-specific Nur77 deletion, in a standard CS-
induced murine COPD model. The results will elucidate a protective role in COPD of the receptor Nur77, and
may identify it as a promising new therapeutic target for specific agonists to treat a widespread fatal disease."
10726599,"Project Summary:
The goal of this research is to validate a novel treatment for neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI-NP)
using a novel and highly clinically-relevant pig model. This research is innovative as we will validate exciting
new findings from research in rodents which discovered a highly efficacious treatment for SCI-NP in a clinically-
relevant pig model. Specifically, the new therapy involves delivering a gene construct encoding 6 copies of the
NMDA antagonist serine-histrogranin and 1 copy of the opioid agonist endomorphin 1 (6SHG/EM1) via
intraspinal delivery as detailed in Jergova et al., 2017. Indeed in the study to be validated, rats with the
6SHG/EM1 gene therapy did not exhibit a return of allodynia for the duration of the study (12 weeks). Data also
showed that the effects of 6SHG/EM1 were transiently blocked by intrathecal injection of anti-SHG and naloxone,
suggesting that the effects were due to ""on-target"" mechanisms. The expression of the transgenes in the spinal
cord was confirmed in neuronal cells near and around the dorsal horn in the vicinity of the injection location
(Jergova et al., 2017). To accelerate translation of this new therapy, we have back-translated quantitative
sensory testing (QST) methods used in human medicine to evaluate neuropathic pain for use in pigs. In
conjunction with QST testing, we have also developed a pig pain scale that includes both reflexive and
supraspinal responses, critically important for translation in pain research. We will employ a collaborative
approach to test the overarching hypothesis that administration of 6SHG/EM1 after SCI ameliorates SCI-NP in
a highly clinically-relevant pig model which closely mimics human SCI. Our goal is to optimize and scale-up this
highly efficacious SCI-NP treatment by using a clinically-relevant pig model to define key variables needed for
successful translation. We will test our overarching hypothesis and achieve these translational goals by
accomplishing three specific aims. In aim 1 we will optimize the methodology for successful delivery of AAV
gene therapy to the spinal cord after SCI in a pig model. In aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that post-SCI
administration of 6SHG/EM1 in the sub-acute period after SCI will ameliorate SCI-NP in a pig model. The SCI
model will be a midthoracic contusion/compression injury in pigs that is well established in our research
laboratory and as well as used by others. Baseline quantitative sensory testing (QST) over multiple dermatomes
will be conducted. QST includes assessments of thermal (hot and cold), tactile, pressure, and dynamic stimuli.
Pain responses will be scored on the porcine evoked pain scale that we developed which includes both supra-
spinal (affective) and spinal (reflexive) components. At weeks 6 after SCI (a time point when neuropathic pain
is developed), pigs will receive intraspinal injection of 6SHG/EM1 construct in adeno-associated virus (AAV).
Motor and QST responses will be evaluated for a subsequent 12 weeks. In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis
that post-SCI administration of 6SHG/EM1 in the sub-acute period after SCI induces expression of SHG and
EM1 transgenes and peptides in the spinal cord. At 12 weeks after SCI, pigs from aim 2 will be humanely
euthanized and spinal cord tissue, dorsal root ganglia, and cerebrospinal fluid extracted. We will assess the
presence and expression pattern of SHG and EM1 transgenes and peptides in these tissues using fluorescent-
linked immunosorbent assays (FLISA) and immunohistochemical evaluations. Expression patterns will be
correlated with pain outcome data. The results of this study are the critical next step in translation of this new
therapy to clinical trials, and ultimately to provide relief to Veterans who suffer from neuropathic pain after SCI."

Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the only projection neurons in the retina that relay visual information to the
brain. These neurons, which collectively form the optic nerve, are highly vulnerable when their axons are
damaged. Preclinical animal studies have tested several approaches to promote RGC survival following axonal
damage. Clinical trials aimed at assessing the neuroprotective effects are currently underway. However, attaining
strong neuroprotection for patients suffering from optic neuropathy remains an elusive goal.
Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) are a diverse class of transcribed RNAs, defined as transcripts with lengths
exceeding 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins. Although several lncRNAs have been shown to play
vital roles in regulating gene expression networks in the central nervous system (CNS), the functional roles of
the majority of lncRNAs are unknown. In our recent effort to investigate RGC type-specific gene expression, we
performed RNAsequencing (RNA-seq) on distinct RGC populations. Through this work, we identified hundreds
of lncRNAs that are uniquely induced in different RGC types after axonal injury. The functions of these lncRNAs
remain to be determined.
To investigate lncRNAs’ functional roles, and to examine whether modulating the expression of injury-induced
lncRNAs affects RGC survival after axonal injury, we generated adeno-associated viruses (AAV) expressing
shRNAs against select lncRNAs, and carried out an in vivo screen using optic nerve crush (ONC). Through this
work, we find that silencing one lncRNA results in striking neuroprotection for RGCs after ONC. This lncRNA is
a long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) which we name optic nerve injury-induced lncRNA 1 or Onil1. Like
the vast majority of lncRNAs that we found to be differentially expressed in RGCs, virtually nothing is known
about this lincRNA. Overall, our study provides us with an exciting and unique opportunity to investigate the role
of lncRNAs in regulating RGC survival after injury, and elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms underlying
this process. In this proposal, we seek to combine in vivo models of optic nerve injury, functional and behavioral
assays, and bioinformatics to investigate the contribution of Onil1 and other lncRNAs in regulating RGC survival.
To this end, in Aim 1, we will systemically assess the extent of RGC protection conferred by silencing lncRNAs
in adult RGCs after ONC. In Aim 2, we will assess whether silencing lncRNA induces RGC protection and
functional rescue in mouse models of glaucoma. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will use immunostaining, RNA-seq, ATAC-
seq and ChIRP-MS to investigate the mechanisms by which Onil1 regulates RGC survival."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) often leads to irreversible deterioration of kidney function
that often progresses to End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD). CKD has emerged as a
serious public health issue and data obtained from the USRDS reveals that 20 million
patients in the United States suffer from CKD. As glomerular diseases secondary to
podocyte dysfunction account for greater than 80% of all CKD, an intensive molecular
and genetic approach to identify mechanisms for podocyte development, maintenance
and repair may provide new therapeutic targets Previous evidence has suggested the
importance of endocytic trafficking in podocytes, Using a unbiased screen, we have
unearthed Lrp1 within clathrin coated vesicles, and as a potentially important gene to
maintain the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. Loss of Lrp1 specifically in mice
podocytes resulted in proteinuria and progression of CKD. Therefore, In Aim 1, we will
define the fundamental mechanisms on how loss of Lrp1 contributes to podocyte
dysfunction through characterizing the newly generated knockout mice. In Aim 2, we will
determine how Lrp1 signaling plays a potential role in dsDNA repair by examining genes
critical for nonhomologous end joining Setd1a and Lig4, and test SP16, a FDA approved
Lrp1 agonist in the treatment of mouse models of glomerular injury."

A fundamental question in neurobiology is how environmental signals – both developmental and ongoing–
induce plasticity in neural circuits and networks to shape behavior. Circadian photoperiod, the proportion of
daylight in a solar day, is a pervasive environmental signal that varies substantially with latitude and season,
and drives acute and long-term effects on mood regulation in humans and in animal models. The associations
of the molecular circadian clock and photoperiod with mood disorders are clear, but the neurobiological
mechanisms remain incompletely understood.
The serotonergic dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN) are a critical nexus for integrating circadian photoperiodic input
with mood and reward. They receive light input from the circadian visual system and polysynaptic input from
the biological clock nuclei and make widespread outputs, including to midbrain nuclei mediating motivation and
reward through dopaminergic transmission. Seasonal photoperiods (winter–like “short days” vs. summer-like
“long days”) induce enduring changes in mouse DRN serotonin neurons - programming their excitability and
intrinsic electrical properties, their serotonin content, as well as anxiety and depressive-like behaviors. We
have previously shown that the TREK-1 K+ channel mRNA expression is photoperiodically regulated in DRN 5-
HT neurons, and therefore may play a key role in photoperiodic programming of serotonin excitability. A
number of independent lines of evidence indicate that TREK-1 in DRN neurons impact mood regulation and
mood disorders. We now also report intriguing sex-dependent photoperiodic regulation of dopamine uptake
and release downstream of the DRN in the NAc of female mice, indicating photoperiodic impact on circuitry for
motivation and reward that mirrors the reported female bias of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) in humans.
We propose as our overall hypothesis that DRN 5-HT neurons are a primary site of photoperiodic
programing – in which transcriptional regulation of TREK-1 plays a key role in regulating neuronal
excitability. In congruence with the NIMH RDOC paradigm, we envision photoperiod programing as an
extended circuit for positive valence system behaviors in which the output of the programmed serotonergic
DRN induces convergent drive by the DRN and VTA inputs to alter NAc function, driving changes in the output
of reinforcement/motivated behaviors. We will further elucidate a mechanistic basis of photoperiodic
programming of 5-HT neurons involving TREK-1, and downstream effects of this programming on
positive valence systems, including NAc dopamine release and uptake, NAc synaptic plasticity, and
NAc-driven motivation behavior. Completion of these Aims will enhance understanding of key
neurobiological mechanisms underlying photoperiodic regulation of mood, motivation, and reinforcement."

 The primary goal of the present proposal is to explore the role of pathway-specific RE neurons in the
synchronized activity of the prefrontal-hippocampal circuit (mPFC-HC) and memory related rhythms in wake
(episodic-like sequence memory) and in sleep states (REM/NREM). To accomplish this, Aim1 will determine if
and how excitation of RE neurons can drive memory related mPFC-HC coherent states. The first experiment
will test a range of relevant frequencies in RE-pathway specific neurons to identify a stimulation capable of
driving mPFC-HC coherent modes in freely behaving rats. Using a closed-loop optogenetic approach, the
second experiment will stimulate RE neurons to induce mPFC-HC coherence during different endogenous
coherence states to boost memory performance while rats perform in a nonspatial sequence memory task. As I
transition to my independent career (R00), Aim2 will explore the role of pathway-specific RE neurons in driving
theta and delta related sleep oscillations (REM/NREM) using a closed-loop setup. Two new technical skills will
be acquired during the K99 training phase which include 1) learning to run a sophisticated rodent sequence
memory task capable of testing multiple RE-dependent memory dimensions, and 2) implementing a cutting
edge closed-loop optogenetic control system capable of detecting neurophysiological coherence modes
between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex in `real-time' to trigger RE optogenetic stimulations.
 My previous training in anatomy, optogenetics, multisite electrophysiological recordings, and my theoretical
background on RE-related mnemonic processes and arousal provides me with the foundation and technical
skills necessary to pursue these goals with this additional training. Florida International University, a research-
intensive and Hispanic-serving institution, is the ideal place to complete my training because it offers all the
resources (mentor, equipment, facilities, and professional development programs) necessary to carry out the
proposed experiments and training plan. The mentoring team is composed of two well-established and highly
successful scientists, who together are committed to my success and will adequately prepare me for a career
as an independent research investigator. The K99 phase of this award would allow me to enter the
independent stage of my career with the theoretical, technical, methodological, networking, and laboratory
management skills necessary to answer scientific questions at the circuit and network level, establish my own
laboratory, and independently pursue future scientific directions. As a MOSAIC awardee and future principal
investigator, one of my goals is to become a role model and mentor to other underrepresented students and
scientists, so that I can enhance diversity, equality, and inclusion in the biomedical field.
 Overall, this research will shed new light on the role of RE in driving network-wide memory states, while the
training plan will equip me professionally to launch my independent career."

 CRISPR-Cas9 and related technologies have dramatically transformed our ability to manipulate the
genomes of countless organisms, generate disease models, rapidly discover the functions of genes, and
create new treatments for genetic disorders. Nevertheless, the full potential of the field has yet to be realized.
Over the past fifteen years, the Peterson and Yeh labs have collaborated in the development of genome
editing tools and have contributed to several key advances, including the first use of CRISPR-Cas9 to modify
the genome of any animal, the first use of prime editing in zebrafish, and the first technology for high-
throughput CRISPR screening in a vertebrate. During the current funding period, we have successfully
completed all three of our aims and produced new technologies, TICIT and MIC-Drop, that raise exciting new
opportunities for further development and application. In this competitive renewal application, we propose to
expand on TICIT and MIC-Drop, developing several useful new gene-editing approaches.
 Aim 1 builds upon Targeted Integration by CRISPR-Cas9 and Integrase Technologies (TICIT), which
utilizes the site-specific DNA recombinase – phiC31 integrase – to insert DNA into genomic target sites that
have been pre-specified by CRISPR-Cas9 modification. Unlike traditional transgenic methods which lead to
random genome insertion, TICIT enables precise integration of plasmids into the genome at prespecified loci,
avoiding inadvertent gene disruption and positional effects. Building upon TICIT, we propose now to expand
the utility of integrases for site-specific genome editing. In the renewal application, we propose new
technologies to make TICIT more efficient and permit combinatorial uses of multiple integrases in various safe-
harbor genomic loci. Additionally, we will use the optimized TICIT platform to develop high-throughput
screening systems for isolating synthetic promoters with enhanced cell-state or cell-type specificity.
 Aim 2 builds upon Multiplexed, Intermixed CRISPR Droplets (MIC-Drop), which combines multiplexed
CRISPR sgRNAs, Cas9 protein, and DNA barcodes into nanoliter-volume microfluidic droplets that can then be
injected from a single needle into thousands of zebrafish. MIC-Drop enables rapid and efficient disruption of
hundreds or thousands of genes, and after identification of phenotypes of interest, the causative gene can be
quickly identified by barcode recovery. Building upon MIC-Drop, we propose now to expand the utility of
MIC-Drop for molecular phenotyping. Previously, we have used visual inspection to identify zebrafish
mutants with interesting phenotypes, followed by PCR-based recovery of the DNA barcodes. We now plan to
combine MIC-Drop technology with powerful molecular phenotyping tools, such as single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq) and metabolomics. In this aim, we will develop new methods, barcodes, and workflows that will
enable efficient gene disruption and molecular phenotyping at unprecedented scales."

Co-use of opioids (fentanyl, heroin) and methamphetamine is now highly prevalent across the U.S., and is
associated with severe health risks, including HIV infection and overdose, and poorer treatment outcomes. Yet,
the neural circuit alterations and accompanying behavioral changes associated with this polysubstance use are
poorly defined, as are the similarities/differences between distinct patterns of opioid/methamphetamine co-use.
Notably, the patterning of drug use can have enormous impacts on both circuit-wide brain adaptations and the
development of addiction behaviors. Accordingly, delineating whether the outcomes that occur following distinct
patterns of polysubstance use reflect the summation of each drug or are synergistic or distinct is particularly
important, and likely critical for designing appropriate and long-lasting therapeutic interventions. To address this,
we will use rat self-administration models of sequential (use of each substance on separate occasions) and
simultaneous (use of both substances at the same time) polysubstance use of fentanyl and methamphetamine
that mimic patterns of human consumption. Comparisons will also be made to groups that undergo self-
administration of each substance singly. We will combine behavioral analysis with in vivo fiber photometry, ex
vivo slice electrophysiology and targeted chemogenetic cellular manipulations to comprehensively map how
striatal circuit activity is associated with addiction behaviors following different patterns of fentanyl and/or
methamphetamine use. Striatal circuits (i.e., the NAc and its glutamate afferents from the PFC and its dopamine
afferents from the VTA) will be examined as they are a key node of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit that
is well-established to regulate addiction-related behaviors of both opioids and stimulants. The overarching
hypothesis of this work is that neural alterations in striatal circuitry will differ between sequential and simultaneous
patterns of fentanyl and methamphetamine polysubstance use. In addition, we hypothesize that polysubstance
use will produce synergistic and/or distinct circuit changes rather than summative changes compared to single
substance use. Collectively, these results would support the idea that the patterning of substance use is
particularly important for conferring the development of addiction-related behaviors. This work is significant as
polysubstance use of opioids and methamphetamine is common and riskier, but vastly understudied. Our studies
will help to address this gap and will provide an important and necessary foundation for ultimately understanding
why polysubstance use drives continued drug use, and what neural cells and adaptations may be particularly
relevant targets for therapies aimed at addressing polysubstance use."

During development, epithelial cells undergo programmed changes in morphology and position to create
complex tissues. Studies in model organisms have identified a conserved set of effector proteins that directly
alter cell shape, although the upstream pathways that coordinate these processes across large groups of cells
remain poorly understood. A paradigm for studying epithelial remodeling is cell intercalation in the Drosophila
neurectoderm, and it was shown that three members of the highly conserved Toll receptor family are expressed
in overlapping striped patterns to organize rapid cell rearrangements in this tissue. Toll receptors are widely
expressed throughout human epithelia, and they have been extensively studied in the context of innate immune
signaling. However, the control of cell morphology by Toll receptors has received very little attention. The focus
of this proposal is to understand how non-uniform Toll receptor expression affects cortical tension, cell-cell
adhesion, and mitochondrial dynamics to control cell shape and behavior during epithelial remodeling. We will
use newly developed CRISPR/Cas9-derived genetic backgrounds and antibodies to characterize how Toll
receptors control cell polarity to trigger intercalation; we will apply non-destructive techniques to characterize the
bioenergetics of epithelial reorganization in intact living embryos; and we will investigate unaddressed links
between Toll receptor, Rho, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Our first hypothesis is that neighboring
cells sense differences in the expression of individual Toll receptor types to increase cortical tension and
decrease cell-cell adhesion. We have developed a genetic system for expressing individual receptors in a single
stripe that we will use to systematically characterize and compare the effects of each Toll receptor type on cell
morphology and to identify the protein domains necessary for modulating cell shape. Our second hypothesis is
that rapid cellular rearrangements during neurectoderm elongation require changes in mitochondrial signaling to
drive cytoskeletal and junctional reorganization. To test this, we will use multiphoton microscopy to visualize the
endogenous autofluorescence of metabolic cofactors to quantify cellular redox state in live embryos during
epithelial remodeling, and then use gain- and loss-of-function techniques to determine what role mitochondrial
fusion and fission play in epithelial reorganization. Our third hypothesis is that Toll receptor and GPCR signaling
converge to activate Rho Kinase and trigger cell intercalation in the neurectoderm. We will use gain- and loss-
of-functional analyses to determine how these two signaling pathways intersect to control cortical tension, cell-
cell adhesion, and mitochondrial dynamics during epithelial remodeling. Successful completion of these
experiments will give us a more comprehensive understanding of how Toll receptors function at a molecular level
to control cellular biomechanics and bioenergetics during dynamic tissue remodeling."
10849771,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infects over a quarter of the global population and remains a significant health
threat causing millions of deaths annually. Multidrug resistance of Mtb leads to a higher risk of failed treatment
and death. This high tuberculosis burden worldwide demands the discovery of novel cellular and molecular
targets for developing efficacious protective strategies. It is known that mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT)
cells respond to non-peptidic bacterial metabolites and function as innate-like sensors to elicit rapid immune
responses against Mtb infections. MAIT cell activation in Mtb infection requires the recognition of Mtb metabolite
antigens presented by a monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule in an individual-unrestricted manner, similar
to the binding of pathogen-associated molecular patterns to innate receptors. Activated MAIT cells are expected
to induce rapid anti-Mtb MAIT cell responses at early or chronic tuberculosis infections. Although recent studies
provided strong evidence supporting the protective role of MAIT cells against tuberculosis in mice and humans,
the model antigen from E. coli induced partial protection in mice and primates, together with side effects in some
other primate subjects. This suboptimal protective MAIT cell response induced by the E.coli antigen against Mtb
infection is likely because Mtb provides different antigens to activate and recognize MAIT cells or the potential
toxic effect of the E. coli compound. Indeed, MAIT cells respond differently to various pathogens, and the current
critical unknown is which Mtb antigens stimulate anti-Mtb MAIT cell responses. Based on our validated
functional metabolomics platform, we will apply these chemical biology approaches to test the central
hypothesis that Mtb metabolites stimulate human MAIT cell response against Mtb infections with two aims. In
Aim 1, we will use our purified and preliminarily identified Mtb agonists to induce protective anti-Mtb responses
of polyclonal and monoclonal human MAIT cells in comparison with the E. coli antigen. Mtb agonists will stimulate
MAIT cells from healthy donors, tuberculosis patients, and lung tissues. The protection of MAIT cell responses
will be mainly measured by killing Mtb-infected cells and inhibiting Mtb growth. In Aim 2, we will determine the
chemical structures of Mtb agonists using functional metabolomics to stimulate anti-Mtb MAIT cell responses.
We have obtained MAIT-stimulatory fractions using high-pressure liquid chromatography and identified
candidate Mtb agonists that activated MAIT cells. Our mass spectrometry-based functional metabolomics will
further define the structures of Mtb agonists from active chemical fractions. Resulted in novel Mtb metabolites
will be either chemically synthesized or purified for MAIT cell activation and protection against Mtb infections.
Upon successful completion, we will elucidate the structures and functions of Mtb metabolites to induce a
protective MAIT cell response against tuberculosis infections. Ultimately, Mtb antigens can be applied to
understand MAIT activation mechanisms in tuberculosis disease and develop novel anti-mycobacterial
strategies for fighting tuberculosis in humans."

Weather extremes and natural disasters associated with climate change are wreaking havoc on human health
worldwide, and these events will become more frequent and more intense in coming years. Other disruptive,
non-climatic shocks – such as exposure to armed conflict and disease outbreaks – also have significant impacts
on health globally. Shock-induced mobility patterns likely play a role in linking shocks to adverse health
outcomes. Despite the importance of understanding these relationships, little research has been conducted to
date due to a dearth of detailed temporal and spatial data on mobility patterns, particularly in settings with limited
resources. Novel location data derived from mobile phone use promises to elucidate granular human mobility
patterns. Leveraging established partnerships to obtain the data and machine learning methods to process it,
the proposed research will provide critical information on the health of shock-affected populations in Kenya, an
east African country with increasing climate variability and a history of armed conflict. Further, this project will
demonstrate the utility of applying these data to address critical population health problems. The proposed
Pathway to Independence Award will provide essential and synergistic training to position Dr. Luetke as a leading
expert in using big data and artificial intelligence methods to elucidate the social and health implications of shocks
and human mobility responses in the context of climate change and increasing global insecurity. The mentored
phase of the proposed project will provide training in (1) geospatial methods and population-environment
research, (2) machine learning for spatial big data, (3) demographic theories and methods related to human
migration, and (4) career development activities to prepare to be an independent investigator and future tenure-
track faculty member. The empirical research of the proposed project will address three primary aims: (Aim 1)
Use artificial intelligence methods to process the mobile phone data to identify mobility patterns over time (2018-
2022) and space; (Aim 2) Test the role of climate variability, natural disasters, and armed conflict as mechanisms
to explain changes in these mobility patterns; and (Aim 3) Quantify the effect of climate extremes, natural
disasters, and armed conflict on women’s exposure to intimate partner violence and explore mobility patterns,
particularly when crisis-induced, as a mediator of these associations. The training and research detailed in this
proposal will form a solid foundation to launch a rigorous and sustainable research agenda and provide the pilot
work for a future R01 proposal. The additional training and mentorship will be an important step toward
establishing a rich, independent research career aimed at reducing social and health disparities. A strong
interdisciplinary mentorship team and an outstanding supportive training environment at the Minnesota
Population Center provide a foundation for Dr. Luetke to fill an important scientific niche on understanding the
impacts of external shocks, migration, and health outcomes for women in Sub-Saharan Africa."

 Astrocytes are the most abundant and diverse glial cells in the adult brain, comprising 70% of the glial
constituency. Astrocytes perform essential tasks for normal brain function and contribute to various neurological
disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their role in health
and disease remains a mystery. Recently, we found that NFIA contributes to astrocyte-mediated regulation of
brain circuits and memory in the brain, and it was highly increased in reactive astrocytes in the AD mouse brain.
Although the reactive astrocytes are closely associated with degenerating neurons across multiple brain regions
in patients with AD, it is largely unknown how astrocytes contribute to the initiation and progression of AD and
how astrocytic NFIA regulates functions of astrocytes and reactive astrocytes.
 Here, using a newly generated animal model, in preliminary data, we found that gain or- / loss of- NFIA
in astrocytes showed decreasing/increasing of A accumulation in AD mouse brain. These results lead us to the
hypothesis that astrocytic NFIA has a role in astrocytes and reactive astrocytes for AD pathogenesis. To test
this, we proposed experiments to confirm NFIA expression in the human AD brain and to analyze AD
pathogenesis in AD mouse brain with behavioral alteration by time different NFIA manipulation in astrocytes
(Aim 1). We next asked how NFIA contributes to the alteration of astrocyte function for AD pathogenesis since
NFIA regulates astrocyte core properties. To test this, we proposed experiments to confirm alteration of A
production / clearance ability of astrocytes, astrocytes calcium activation and astrocyte mediated
neurotransmission by time different NFIA manipulation (Aim 2). Preliminary data revealed that NFIA regulated
AD-related genes in hippocampal astrocytes. Therefore, we will use RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to investigate the
NFIA-regulated candidates and networks for AD pathogenesis in astrocytes and reactive astrocytes.
Furthermore, we will validate the candidates using gene manipulating methods in astrocytes and reactive
astrocytes from the initiation to progression stages of AD pathogenesis (Aim 3).
 These results will reveal whether and how astrocytic NFIA contributes to AD pathogenesis and how
astrocytes contribute to AD pathogenesis from initiation to progression. For my career development, these
studies will provide training in the glia-AD relationship under my mentor Dr. Deneen (expert in astrocyte biology)
and co-mentor Dr. Jankowsky (expert in Alzheimer's disease) at Baylor College of Medicine. Since astrocytes
are intimately connected with neurons and are dysregulated in all neurological disorders, this proposal aims to
uncover how astrocytes contribute to neurodegenerative disease development. Towards this goal, the proposed
research will apply new approaches to astrocyte biology to delineate genetic and functional mechanisms involved
in the progression of neurodegeneration."
10726613,"Eradication of the latent HIV reservoir remains the major stumbling block to achieving cure. To eliminate this
reservoir, accurate definition (a biomarker) of latently infected cells of different types and within different
tissues is highly needed. Several biomarkers proposed previously were able to very modestly enrich (~10-fold)
for latently infected cells, but failed to capture the substantial portion of the latent reservoir. Without the
detailed characterization of latently infected cells, identification of a suitable biomarker to capture the majority
of the reservoir cells will remain challenging. Our long-term goal is to identify a biomarker of HIV latency that
can be translated into strategies to target latently infected cells for elimination. The overall objectives of this
application are to identify cellular and viral determinants of the persistent HIV reservoir and to test selected
biomarkers for their ability to capture latently infected cells in vitro and ex vivo. Our central hypothesis is that a
successful biomarker will be represented by reservoir determinants identified individually for cells of different
phenotypes and states. The term “phenotype” refers to the canonical phenotypic subsets defined with widely
used surface protein markers (for example, maturation phenotype – central memory; functional phenotype – T
helper 17). The term “state” refers to a cell state more broadly defined by the cell's total transcriptomic
signature: gene sets and pathways that are actively expressed. The rationale of the proposed research is the
expected improvement in the efficiency of the reservoir capture when heterogeneity of the reservoir cells is
taken into account. We will test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Identify
cellular determinants of different reservoir subsets and test selected biomarkers for cell enrichment in vitro; (2)
Identify viral determinants of different reservoir subsets in vitro; (3) Validate the reservoir determinants and
selected biomarkers using samples from people with HIV. To identify cellular and viral determinants of the
persistent reservoir, latest innovations in RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technologies will be used. Single cell
RNA-Seq coupled with immunophenotyping will be used to characterize the phenotypes and states of cells that
can be infected with either CXCR4- or CCR5-tropic virus. Genes that can discriminate between latently
infected and uninfected cells will be identified individually within each cell type. To inform on how the identified
cellular determinants of the persistent reservoir relate to the type of provirus that they define, proviral activity in
different cell types will be characterized using single cell RNA-Seq data, full length sequencing of HIV
transcripts, and the PrimeFlow assay to quantify responsiveness of provirus to reactivation stimuli. Biomarkers
will be selected from sets of cellular determinants of the HIV reservoir in different cell subsets. Antibodies
against these proteins will be tested for the ability to efficiently capture the latently infected cells. Our ultimate
goal is to ensure that identified biomarkers can accurately define latently infected cells in clinical samples, and
specifically in different tissue compartments, where as much as 98% of the persistent reservoir resides in vivo.
In collaboration with the Last Gift cohort, we will have a unique opportunity to conduct studies to validate the
identified determinants and biomarkers using blood and lymphoid tissue samples from persons with HIV. When
these studies are complete, we will have identified biomarkers that can be used to capture latently infected
cells in vitro and ex vivo, with the efficiency of at least 500-fold greater than is currently achievable. These
results will be significant because identified biomarkers can be used to isolate reservoir cells from different
tissues to provide better characterization of the latent reservoir across the human body. In the future, these
biomarkers can serve as a platform for development of strategies to target latently infected cells for elimination.
Such research is important to address the needs of people living with HIV, including the large cohort of HIV-
infected patients within the national VA Healthcare System."

Children in foster care (FC) are at risk for chronic health conditions, in part due to exposure to adverse
childhood experiences (ACEs). Early intervention may ameliorate health disparities and economic burden
associated with ACEs, with the preschool period yielding a substantially larger return on investment compared
to interventions later in development. Children in FC are at high risk for sleep disturbances, which are a major
contributor to the development and exacerbation of chronic health conditions, yet behavioral sleep
interventions for this population are nonexistent. This K01 proposal seeks to address this critical gap in care
and promote health equity in this underserved population by developing and implementing a trauma-informed
digital public-health-level sleep intervention called Sleep Wizard, which we will administer to foster caregivers
of preschoolers. Our innovative approach involves collaboration with a planning group of key stakeholders
including FC workers and parents, and experts in sleep, trauma, health, and interventions in the context of FC.
The goal of Aim 1 is to develop and digitize initial Sleep Wizard intervention content with the planning group,
informed by the literature on trauma-informed care, evidence-based strategies to support healthy sleep, FC
licensing regulations, and foster parent needs and experiences. In Aim 2, Sleep Wizard will be pretested by
foster caregivers who will provide quantitative and qualitative data on acceptability, feasibility, and
appropriateness of the intervention, which will be used to make final intervention modifications. Aim 3 will
evaluate whether Sleep Wizard is associated with improvements in foster caregiver behaviors around sleep,
and in child sleep from pre to post intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. This will be the first large scale
sleep intervention developed and tested in this population. Local and national stakeholders have expressed
enthusiasm and have committed to involvement in the development, implementation, and evaluation of Sleep
Wizard. To achieve the research plan, the PI will execute a structured comprehensive training plan to gain
specialized skills in (1) Sleep, mental health, and ACEs in early childhood in the context of foster care, (2)
Developing partnerships with the child welfare community, (3) Intervention development and implementation
science, (4) Implementation and dissemination of digital interventions, and (5) Conducting clinical trials.
Training will be overseen by an outstanding mentorship team with cross-cutting expertise in these areas and a
track record of successful mentorship experiences and collaborations. Implementation of the research and
training plan will also be bolstered by support from the institutional environment, namely Brown Medical
School, Bradley Hospital, and two new major center grants focused on promoting the career development of
early-stage investigators in 1) childhood stress, trauma, and resilience, and 2) sleep and circadian rhythms in
child and adolescent mental health. This award will catapult my transition to an independent translational
scientist with a career high in scientific and public health impact in early life adversity, sleep, and health."

 Reducing rates of relapse after abstinence is a key challenge for curbing the ongoing opioid epidemic. One
of the common factors for triggering relapse is re-exposure to drug-associated cues. In rats, cue-induced
oxycodone seeking progressively intensifies (incubates) over the first weeks of abstinence from extended access
oxycodone self-administration, and remains high for at least a month of abstinence. Our recently published work
demonstrated a critical role of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in this incubation. However, molecular mechanisms in
OFC underlying this incubation are largely unknown. Specifically, our observation of a progressive increase of
neuronal activation in OFC associated with oxycodone seeking could be the result of time-dependent molecular
adaptations in OFC during abstinence. Emerging evidence has implicated both the ubiquitin proteasome system
(UPS) and mitochondrial regulation in addiction-related plasticity. Linking these two lines of work, we found that
mRNA expression of March5, a mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase, was significantly decreased in OFC on
abstinence day 15 compared with saline control. A key role of March5 is to suppress mitochondrial fission, by
degrading mitochondrial fission mediators such as dynamin-related protein 1(Drp1). Based on this preliminary
work, here we propose to examine the role of March5 and associated mitochondria dynamics in incubation of
oxycodone craving. In Aim 1, we will use biochemical approaches to examine protein expression of March5 and
its downstream target Drp1 in the OFC, and use viral-mediated gene manipulation to determine if March5 in the
OFC plays a causal role in the incubation of oxycodone craving. In Aim 2, we will use viral vectors to label
mitochondria in OFC neurons and examine the morphology of mitochondria in OFC neurons during incubation
of oxycodone craving. Overall, this proposal will initiate a new line of research focusing on the mitochondrial E3
ubiquitin ligase in OFC in relapse to drug seeking. From a clinical perspective, this work will provide targets for
developing pharmacological interventions to decrease drug craving and promote abstinence."

Opioid use disorder is a life-long burden for many individuals, imposing high personal, financial, and health costs.
Even after prolonged abstinence, many individuals in recovery will go on to relapse, including those that received
medication-assisted treatments. Repeated opioid exposure usurps normal reward circuit function by producing
long-lasting molecular changes that alter physiology and support continued drug use. These cellular adaptations
have been implicated in sustained relapse vulnerability, but we lack a clear understanding of what drives their
persistence. There is a further lack of information on the precise molecular adaptations underlying altered circuit
function, and in which specific circuits they act to promote relapse. Understanding this “who, what, when, and
where,” will be key to identifying new therapeutic targets. Here, we will answer these questions using a multi-
level approach that allows us to sequence, manipulate, and record from neurons in specific circuits in the context
of opioid self-administration and relapse.
Our preliminary data show that both genetically-distinct and genetically-identical neuron subtypes in the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) undergo differential molecular adaptations after fentanyl self-administration, which we
hypothesize arises from activity-dependent transcriptional changes in specific circuits. We further hypothesize
the transcriptional changes are sustained by methylation and demethylation at the gene promoters. We will first
record calcium activity in VTA neurons that project to either the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or amygdala (AMY)—
projections known to be important for drug intake and relapse, respectively. Then, in the same neurons from the
same animals, we will identify which gene networks are transcriptionally changed after self-administration and
persist until relapse testing. Next, we will identify the DNA methylation marks driving sustained differential
expression, with an emphasis on genes important for synaptic plasticity. Next, we will use CRISPR/dCas9 fusion
constructs to manipulate methylation states at our identified loci in specific circuits. This proposal will allow us to
define the specific VTA circuits that support opioid intake and relapse, which gene networks support activity of
these circuits, and how DNA methylation cements the transcriptional landscape to alter behavior. This award will
allow research into neural mechanisms of opioid use disorder with unprecedented resolution, and has the
potential to transform how we approach studying the genetics of substance use disorders. Together, this critical
information will help inform new treatment strategies to prevent relapse."

Mycobacterial infections, broadly including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and those caused by
nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) like the fast-growing Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab), as well as the slow-
growing Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), represent some of the most clinically challenging and deadly
infections of the 21st century. Treatments typically involve regimens of multiple antibiotics that are administered
for lengthy periods of time, and poor outcomes are common. -Lactam antibiotics have not traditionally been a
part of these treatment regimens, due to -lactamase mediated resistance, and because some classes of -
lactams lack antimycobacterial activity. Significantly, for peptidoglycan crosslinking, mycobacterial species
primarily use an alternate L,D-transpeptidase (Ldt) in place of the canonical D,D-transpeptidase (Ddt) (or
penicillin binding protein, PBP), the latter of which is the primary target of typically administered -lactams. Ldts
and Ddts are nonhomologous proteins which, in part, explains the apparent ineffectiveness of this drug class
against mycobacterial species. This application involves design and synthesis of carbapenem antibiotics with
substantial and unusual (atypical) structural alterations, in contrast to existing agents which differ only at the C2
position. Previously, we have demonstrated that these scaffold modifications can improve activity against Gram-
negative pathogens, minimize efflux, and improve resistance to -lactamase-mediated hydrolysis. Preliminary
studies for this project yielded an atypical carbapenem with superior potency compared to commercially available
carbapenems against diverse Mtb and Mab clinical isolates. Unlike meropenem, this new atypical carbapenem
maintained its potency against resistant mycobacterial pathogens in the absence of a combination -lactamase
inhibitor, displaying up to 20-fold improvements over meropenem in activity against these resistant strains. Its
excellent,broad spectrum antimycobacterial potency (MICs < 1 g/ml) was not diminished by carbapenemase
producing mycobacterial species nor was activity further improved by combination with -lactamase inhibitors
thus indicating -lactamase stability. Activity was also assessed against a diverse panel of nonmycobacterial
species indicating the new antibiotic is beginning to demonstrate selectivity for the mycobacteria genus over
other Gram-negative and Gram-positive species. We now plan to develop this initial discovery into an orally
bioavailable clinically useful antimycobacterial agent and to further improve the antimycobacterial potency and
specificity of this unique atypical carbapenem. Stability to carbapenemases will be an asset in an orally
bioavailable agent since many carbapenemase inhibitors (e.g. avibactam) are not orally bioavailable. The
scientific operations are guided by a highly qualified team including synthesis, microbiology, biochemistry, and
structural biology. A thorough and rigorous array of analyses, including numerous in vitro and in vivo PK
evaluations, will guide development."

A cardinal feature of anxiety disorders is exaggerated fear to cues signaling threat. The prevailing view of the
neural circuit for fear learning is a division of labor in which the amygdala and associated forebrain regions
signal threat probability, and brainstem regions organize fear output. This view is the intellectual foundation for
proposals that forebrain threat dysfunction drives exaggerated fear in anxiety disorders. Much more than
organizing fear output, my laboratory is showing brainstem networks compute prediction error – a learning
signal to drive fear learning. Further, brainstem networks signal threat – a function purported to be specific to
the forebrain. This proposal will reveal brainstem networks that signal threat probability, compute prediction
error, and organize fear output. Aim 1 will detail the emergence of brainstem threat and behavior signaling
dynamics. Female and male rats will receive Neuropixels implant through a complete dorsal-ventral brainstem
axis. Thousands of single units will be recorded from 20+ brainstem regions during a fear discrimination
procedure that produces selective learning to a threat cue. Firing analyses during the cue period will reveal the
emergence of brainstem network threat signaling and tracking of diverse behaviors over fear learning. Aim 2
will establish a framework for brainstem prediction error dynamics. Firing analyses during the outcome period
will link brainstem network firing dynamics for prediction error that precede the emergence of fear learning. Aim
3 will reveal forebrain inputs shaping brainstem firing dynamics and fear learning. Rats will receive brainstem
Neuropixels implant. AAV2-retro in a brainstem region and cre-casp3 in a forebrain region will be used to
delete specific inputs to the brainstem (e.g. prelimibic cortex neurons projecting to the periaqueductal gray).
Firing analyses comparing casp3 and control rats will reveal the dependence of brainstem firing dynamics
(threat, behavior, and prediction error) on forebrain inputs. Aim 4 will chemogenetically manipulate brainstem
firing to diminish prediction error computation and fear learning. Rats will receive brainstem Neuropixels
implant. Half will then receive excitatory DREADD infusions in regions flanking the periaqueductal gray –
sources of a tonic prediction error organized by firing inhibition. Actuator injections (JH60), but not saline
injection, will excite brainstem firing – blocking the tonic prediction error network. Firing analyses will reveal the
effects of network interruption on brainstem firing dynamics for threat, behavior, and prediction error. This
proposal will extend scientific knowledge by uncovering core threat functions of brainstem networks. The
proposal will further reveal how forebrain inputs shape brainstem firing dynamics that signal threat, compute
prediction error and organize specific fear behaviors. This knowledge is essential to developing effective
anxiety disorder treatments aimed to reduce fear."

Timothy C. Wang, NCI R35
Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers most often arise in the setting of chronic inflammation and thus the early evolution
of tumors involves extended epithelial interactions with inflammatory stroma. The Wang laboratory has focused
for decades on preneoplastic conditions such as gastritis, esophagitis, colitis and pancreatitis, and the impact of
stromal changes on epithelial progenitors. Recent work from the lab has characterized the origins of GI cancers
from resident stem and progenitor cells, which are expanded during carcinogenesis as a persistent regenerative
response, due in part to a shift from asymmetric to symmetric stem cell division. Our lab has used a combination
of genetic lineage tracing, 3D organoid models, and single cell RNA-sequencing combined with cutting edge
bioinformatic analyses to investigate normal stem and progenitor cells and their early transition to cancer cells.
This work has led to a major paradigm shift in our understanding, for example, of the origins of esophageal
adenocarcinoma. While the lab has elucidated the role of various stromal cell types, a major focus has been on
the role of nerves in modulating both epithelial progenitors as well as other stromal cells. The peripheral nervous
system includes sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sensory nerves, and our lab has pioneered the study of
these nerves in the development of GI cancers. Recent preliminary data from the laboratory has shown that
sensory nerves when activated induce rapid calcium fluxes and modulate the electrical state of tumors cells. In
addition, the laboratory has been studying the role of immature myeloid cells (IMC) that in the setting of cancer
suppress tumor immunity (i.e., MDSC), and which are also modulated by neural signaling. Previous studies have
shown that the trefoil factor TFF2, induced by the inflammatory reflex, modulates IMC and prevents the
development and expansion of MDSC which suppress CD8+ T cells in our models. In addition, we have recently
been studying the impact of myeloid cells on epigenetic changes in epithelial progenitors. Our work has led to
clinical trials and numerous collaborations which we are now seeking to expand, and broaden the impact,
particularly in the areas of nerves and cancer. Our proposed studies have the goal of better understanding the
crosstalk between nerves, myeloid cells and stem cells that lead to cancer, in order to identify new targets and
develop new, more effective and targeted therapies."

The gut microbiota consists of a community of diverse microbes and has many effects on human
(patho)physiology. Microbiome composition has been associated with many diseases, but causal inference is
often lacking. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that the intestinal microbiota can regulate innate
and adaptive immunity, including T cell and antitumor immunity after allogeneic hematopoietic cell
transplantation (allo-HCT) and checkpoint blockade. My lab has focused on the role of gut microbiota in
outcomes of allo-HCT and immunotherapy. For example, we showed that microbiota composition undergoes
significant and frequent changes during allo-HCT and that lower intestinal microbiota diversity is associated with
increased mortality. We also found that dominance by certain species, most frequently Enterococcus, is
associated with lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); that exposure to certain antibiotics is associated with
worse outcomes following allo-HCT and chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CART) therapy; and that hematopoietic
reconstitution is associated with the presence of beneficial flora. These studies have been translated into clinical
trials using autologous fecal microbiota transplant, administration of defined bacterial consortia, and antibiotic
stewardship to spare and/or restore the commensal flora. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the
intestinal microbiome is an important modulator of innate and adaptive immunity in the setting of cancer
immunotherapy. While immunotherapies are curative in some recipients, improving their efficacy and abating
toxicities are unmet needs in oncology. The major goals are to improve cancer immunotherapy by targeting the
intestinal microbiome based on preclinical and clinical studies. Examples of our ongoing and planned studies
include: a) development of a new pipeline for microbiome analysis, b) preclinical and clinical projects regarding
intestinal microbiome and CART, c) new techniques to analyze the effects of diet and drugs on the intestinal
microbiome, and d) preclinical and clinical studies regarding immune modulation by bile acids, as an example
how we study the mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiome can modulate immunity and cancer
immunotherapy. We have organized a multicenter global consortium to collect fecal samples (funded separately
from this application) along with a novel multi-omic approach to integrate patient, microbiome, and tumor profiling
modalities using a computational platform (MSK-MIND) for data harmonization and machine learning. These
investigations will be performed via perpetual dialogue between work with mice and humans: human studies
enable us to observe correlations, develop hypotheses, and test therapeutic strategies; animal studies enable
us to establish or refute causal relationships between microbiota and host immunology and to obtain mechanistic
insights. These data will inform the future development of clinical trials to test therapeutic strategies to enhance
efficacy and decrease toxicity in patients receiving cancer immunotherapy, such as CART and allo-HCT."

 Severe destructive behavior represents a comorbid condition of developmental disability for which risk
increases with intellectual disability severity, communication deficits, and co-occurring autism spectrum
disorder.1,2 Destructive behavior, such as self-injurious behavior and aggression, causes harm to the child and
others and increases the risk for institutionalization, social isolation, physical restraint, medication overuse,
service denial, and abuse.3 Clinicians have used functional analyses to identify the variables that reinforce
destructive behavior and to develop effective, function-based treatments.4-7 Functional communication training
(FCT) is an empirically supported, function-based treatment that decreases destructive behavior.8,9 Using FCT,
the clinician teaches the child to use a functional communication response (FCR) to request the reinforcer
maintaining destructive behavior, while placing destructive behavior on extinction.10-12 For example, if
functional-analysis results showed that attention reinforced destructive behavior, the clinician would provide
attention when the child used the FCR (“Play with me, please”) and would not provide attention for destructive
behavior. Two important limitations of FCT are that (a) schedules of reinforcement maintaining the FCR must
often be thinned gradually to levels that are practical for caregivers to implement consistently in the home and
in the community,13-15 and (b) this necessary process of reinforcement schedule thinning regularly causes
destructive behavior to increase following initially effective treatment, a form of treatment relapse called
resurgence.16-19 The current project aims to improve these limitations of FCT by (a) hastening the process of
reinforcement schedule thinning by removing unnecessary schedule-thinning steps using the results of a
progressive interval assessment20-23 and (b) mitigating the resurgence of destructive behavior by providing
stimuli that highly compete with the reinforcer maintaining destructive behavior.23-27 We will conduct a
randomized controlled trial to evaluate the extent to which these two promising refinements to FCT improve the
process of reinforcement schedule thinning, and an exploratory study will examine the interactive effects of
these two approaches. This novel project has the potential to substantially improve standards of care guiding
the treatment of severe destructive behavior and to improve the long-term outcomes for children and families
afflicted by these debilitating behavior disorders."
10881926,"SUMMARY
 Ryanodine receptors (RyRs), are the Ca2+ release channels of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that play an
essential role in excitaton-contraction coupling of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. Mutations in the cardiac RyR gene
(RYR2) are associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), an arrhythmogenic
syndrome characterized by the development of adrenergically-mediated ventricular tachycardia and sudden death.
CPVT is clearly an arrhythmogenic disorder stemming from intracellular Ca2+ mishandling caused by RyR2
dysfunction. As such, insights gained from CPVT syndromes benefit our mechanistic understanding of other
cardiomyopathies where RyR2-linked Ca2+ mishandling plays a pivotal role. RyR2 dysfunction brings about
deleterious effects in the heart by inducing SR Ca2+ “leak” and/or spontaneous Ca2+ release (SCR), a sudden, diastolic
Ca2+ bolous of critical mass that triggers arrhythmic activity. Thus, reigning in RyR2 hyperactivity to mitigate SR Ca2+
“leak” and avoid SCR is a primary goal of therapeutic regimes for major cardiomyopathies. A group of globular
peptides termed calcins target RyRs with high affinity and specificity. Imperacalcin (IpCa), the founding member of
the calcin family, engages RyRs by entering through their wide vestibule and binding with exquisite precision to a site
deep in the cytosolic “cap” of the channel, adjacent to the transmembrane region, acting as a wedge that “pushes”
laterally the transmembrane helices that line the channel pore, causing it to open and giving rise to a long-lived
subconductance state. In animal models of CPVT, IpCa penetrates the external membrane of ventricular myocytes
and induces a partial depletion of SR Ca2+, thus preventing SCR and in effect relieving the adrenergically-mediated
Ca2+ overload that triggers Ca2+-dependent arrhythmias. Thus, IpCa behaves naturally as an agonist of RyRs, with
anti-arrhytmic effect in cardiomyopathies where SCR is the primary trigger of arrhythmias, and by rational design of
IpCa analogs capable of closing the natural “grooves” it creates with RyRs, it has the tangible potential to become
the first high-affinity RyR blocker that may prevent SR Ca2+ “leak”. Using cryo-EM structures of calcin-RyR complexes
and a series of functional assays, aim 1 will determine the structural domains of calcins that allow them to bind to
RyRs with exquisite affinity and specificity, and to generate calcin analogs capable of blocking RyR ion conduction.
Aim 2 will use CPVT mouse lines that readily present SCR during sympathetic stimulation and a novel rabbit CPVT
model that presents constitutive SR Ca2+ leak and pathological cardiac remodeling to determine whether native and
mutant calcins are capable of preventing RyR dysfunction-triggered arrhythmias. Our multi-disciplnary program, with
well-defined deliverables and milestones and led by two PIs experts in structural (Van Petegem) and functional
(Valdivia) biology of RyRs, will produce a novel paradigm for the treatment of Ca2+-dependent arrhythmias, an area
severely underserved by existent pharmacotherapy."

Novel immunotherapies for cancer are having a major clinical impact, in particular anti-PD-1 mAbs
which have been FDA-approved for 20 cancer entities. However, the mechanisms that explain
why a subset of patients fails to respond to these therapies is incompletely understood.
Understanding these mechanisms should lead to new therapeutic strategies for expanding
efficacy further. Our prior data indicated that a baseline T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment
was predictive of response to anti-PD-1, which augments the functionality of CD8+ T cells already
present within the tumor microenvironment. During the previous funding period, we made multiple
novel discoveries that have been paradigm-shifting for the field, which have coalesced to motivate
continued investigation into 5 research directions: investigation of novel T cell immune
checkpoints, innate immune strategies to promote de novo T cell responses in the tumor
microenvironment, tumor cell-intrinsic oncogenic events mediating immune resistance, regulation
of anti-tumor immunity by the commensal microbiota, and germline variants influencing host anti-
tumor T cell responses. Each of these directions is identifying novel therapeutic opportunities
that are expected to expand the circle of efficacy for checkpoint blockade immunotherapy in the
clinic."

Pathological adaptions in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine system associated with chronic exposure
to opioids and opioid withdrawal can dysregulate responsivity to opioids and contextual cue associations. The
primary goal of this training proposal is to gain new skills in advanced computational techniques to delineate
how functionally diverse subpopulations of VTA dopamine neurons are regulated during morphine exposure
and the formation of morphine contextual associations in non-dependent and morphine-dependent mice.
Foundational findings have identified the intrinsic and synaptic (glutamatergic and GABAergic) adaptations that
VTA dopamine neurons undergo throughout acute and chronic opioid exposure. Yet, few studies have
accounted for the functional diversity of VTA dopamine neurons that mediate distinct aspects of cue-reward
processing and motivation. Dissociating the potential diversity of VTA dopamine responses in the development
of opioid dependence will help unravel the neural basis of the progression of opioid-use disorder. The Zweifel
lab has previously used a genetic approach to isolate functionally distinct subpopulations of dopamine neurons
that project to discrete regions of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor 1
(Crhr1)-Cre VTA dopamine neurons were found to selectively project to the NAc Core (VTACore) and
cholecystokinin (Cck)-Cre VTA dopamine neurons selectively project to the NAc medial Shell (VTAmShell). I
hypothesize that there exist projection-specific neural and behavioral correlates in response to morphine and
during the formation of morphine contextual associations in non-dependent and morphine-dependent mice. I
will investigate this using a systematic approach across three aims. For Aim 1 (K99), I will use behavioral
pharmacology and fiber photometry to determine whether VTACore and VTAmShell dopamine neurons
engage in uniform or differential dose-dependent neural activation dynamics in non-dependent and morphine
dependent mice. For Aim 2 (K99), I will use my skills in conditioned place preference and in vivo fiber
photometry to determine how the VTACore and VTAmShell neurons encode contextual associations to
morphine in non-dependent and morphine dependent mice. For Aim 3 (R00), I will determine the basis of these
pathological adaptations in VTA dopamine subpopulations by dissecting the role mu-opioid receptor (MOR)-
sensitive GABAergic inputs play in morphine contextual associations. During the K99 mentored phase, I will
gain new scientific training in Dr. Larry Zweifel’s laboratory, augmented by my advisory committee, in
computational analytical tools to analyze complex neurophysiological and behavioral data sets. I will also gain
new career development training from Dr. Zweifel, my advisory committee, and the MOSAIC UE5 program that
will facilitate my transition into a successful independent principal investigator in academia. Importantly, I will
continue my work on increasing representation and equity in the biomedical research workforce."

Candidate: Dr. Kimberly Albert, PhD is an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral
Sciences at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center with a strong background in cognitive and systems
neuroscience. Her long-term career goals include gaining the necessary training to become an independent
investigator with research focused on identifying brain mechanisms that maintain cognitive function in the early
stages of pathological brain aging and may underlie subjective cognitive decline (SCD).
Career Development: Dr. Albert seeks to translate her mechanistic work to clinical research that mitigates the
cognitive effects of early AD pathology. Dr. Albert requires advanced training in 1) clinical trials development,
implementation, and management.; 2) the clinical presentation, course, and assessment of SCD and Alzheimer’s
Disease; 3) neuroimaging using EEG/ERP to provide the temporal resolution to assess brain activity related to
component cognitive processes. This training will build on Dr. Albert’s prior experience in human cognitive
neuroscience using functional neuroimaging to examine the neurobiology of cognitive aging.
Research Project: These career goals will be facilitated through a research study focused on the role of
cholinergic support of attention as a cognitive compensatory mechanism in SCD. As early AD-related
neuropathology affects medial temporal areas important for memory, there may be a compensatory
enhancement of attention network activity via increased cholinergic function. Although memory performance is
maintained through this compensatory process, subtle cognitive changes may be obscured. Additionally, the
individual may experience this change as increased required effort or occasional memory failures which result
in subjective cognitive decline despite normal cognitive testing. Cholinergic activity may be an integral
component of maintaining memory function in early AD, through enhanced attention.
The proposed study focuses on attention as a compensatory cognitive process and the relationships between
AD-related pathology and cholinergic neurotransmitter mechanisms that may underlie this compensation in SCD.
The ultimate aim of the study is to identify the role of attention network changes in supporting cognitive
performance in SCD using EEG and fMRI as complimentary neuroimaging approaches. Anticholinergic
challenge will be employed to model AD progression and examine the relationships between cognitive concerns,
attention, and AD pathology. The results of this study will improve our understanding of brain changes that
maintain cognitive performance in the early stages of AD pathology and may underlie SCD.
Environment: Mentoring, collaborations, and resources available through the Department of Psychiatry and
Behavioral Sciences, the Center for Cognitive Medicine, and the Vanderbilt Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Center provide an ideal environment to support Dr. Albert’s transition to independent funding and leadership in
the field of attentional changes in cognitive aging."

10889247,"Project Summary and Abstract
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate many physiological processes during pregnancy. Oxytocin
receptor (OXTR) signaling initiates labor and aberrant signaling through the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R)
is associated with preeclampsia, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and leading cause of pregnancy-related
deaths and premature births. GPCRs are therapeutic targets for complications arising during pregnancy and in
assisted reproduction, but current small-molecule and peptide drugs exhibit off-target binding, require constant
intravenous administration due to short half-lives in vivo, and in some cases are fetotoxic limiting their use.
Differing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and the enhanced specificity make antibodies
attractive therapeutic molecules for targeting GPCRs during pregnancy, but the mechanisms antibodies use to
modulate GPCR signaling is poorly understood. Previous studies with synthetic antibody fragments and
endogenous pathogenic autoantibodies indicate that antibodies can regulate GPCR signaling in a way that does
not mirror the action of prototypical small-molecule and peptide ligands. This proposal combines receptor
pharmacology, structural biology, and antibody engineering to 1) characterize the mechanisms antibody
fragments use to suppress AT1R signaling and demonstrate their ability to selectively target maternal AT1R to
safely treat hypertension during pregnancy, 2) develop antibody selection strategies to mechanistically probe
how synthetic antibody fragments stabilize distinct states of AT1R and OXTR to regulate the recruitment of
signaling effectors and direct biological responses, 3) investigate the mechanisms by which pathogenic
autoantibodies dysregulate AT1R signaling in preeclampsia. Collectively, the proposed research will determine
how antibodies can be leveraged as tools to dissect the finer details of GPCR signaling, provide insight into the
complex pathophysiology of preeclampsia, and identify new avenues to therapeutically target GPCRs to treat
preeclampsia, regulate labor, and improve outcomes in assisted reproduction. The aims described in this
proposal will offer the PI ample opportunities to expand her scientific skillset in structural pharmacology and
antibody engineering, gain training in reproductive biology, and strengthen her expertise in GPCR biology.
Mentorship from Dr. Andrew Kruse, advisory committee members, and collaborators will provide the PI with the
skills needed to complete the proposed work and transition to independence. The extensive training plan for both
scientific and professional development, combined with strong institutional support, will aid the PI in establishing
an interdisciplinary research program studying the molecular function of pregnancy-related GPCRs."
10740856,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project responds directly to PAR-17-203 “Inter-organelle Communication in Cancer.” A new pathway was
discovered called the “mtDNA-IRDS” pathway, through which mitochondria send a stress signal to the nucleus
to regulate expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are usually associated with antiviral
immunity. The mtDNA-IRDS pathway was elucidated during investigations of a unique mouse model of mtDNA
stress caused by haploinsufficiency of the nucleus-encoded mtDNA-packaging factor TFAM (i.e. Tfam+/- mice).
These mice have altered mitochondria and nucleoid structures (the mitochondrial version of chromatin) that
promotes release of mtDNA into the cytoplasm. The surprising feature of these mice (and cells isolated from
them) is that this released mtDNA promotes innate immune signaling, resulting in upregulation of a unique
subset of ISGs known as the Interferon-Related DNA-damage resistance Signature (IRDS). The IRDS
promotes chemotherapy resistance of tumor cells. The Tfam+/- condition enhances spontaneous intestinal
tumorigenesis In the APCMin/+ mouse model of human colorectal cancer (CRC) and new preliminary results
show that knock-out of the tumor suppressor commonly mutated in CRC, ARID1A (a subunit of the nuclear
SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex) also induces the mtDNA-IRDS pathway. Thus, the main premise of
this proposal is that the mtDNA-IRDS pathway increases tumorigenesis and/or chemoresistance in CRC,
which will be tested through completion of the following three Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to understand how
mutations in ARID1A lead to mtDNA-IRDS pathway induction. Aim 2 is to elucidate the mechanism through
which the mtDNA-IRDS pathway enhances nuclear DNA repair using the Tfam+/- model of mtDNA-mediated,
mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling. Aim 3 is to investigate the role of the mtDNA-IRDS pathway in
tumorigenesis and/or chemoresistance in vivo using the Tfam+/-, APCMin/+ and intestinal Arid1a knock-out
mouse models of CRC and human CRC tumor samples. That the PARP9-DTX3L complex is a major driver of
tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in vivo will be tested by crossing these CRC models to Parp9 knock-out
mice. CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women, and treatment of this disease
is plagued by resistance to chemotherapy. The significance of this proposal is that it probes a novel
mechanism of tumorigenesis and chemoresistance due to mtDNA-IRDS pathway activation that has the
potential for therapeutic targeting."
10740857,"People vary considerably in their response to and in the effects of exposure to chemical toxicants and
biological toxins. As a result, the risk of adverse outcomes associated with exposure for different individuals
and populations can be widely divergent. Gene by environment (G x E) interactions likely underlie a significant
component of these risk differences. However, we remain largely ignorant of both the key genetic factors and
the mechanistic association with specific toxins/toxicants. As a result, our capability to mitigate risk by the
identification of susceptible individuals and populations to enable effective preventive efforts remain sorely
limited. Current approaches to identify G x E interactions rely on genetic association studies which generally
lack sufficient power to identify significant associations, due to the large number of genetic variants and small
populations of exposed individuals. We propose, in a fundamentally different approach, to first systematically
identify the common human variants which impact the functional response to a specific toxicant/toxin to
delineate key candidate G X E interactions for targeted consideration in relevant individuals and populations.
We will focus on functional interrogation of 1490 genes, the ToxVar set, which contain an aggregate frequency
of loss of function mutations of >0.1% in all human populations assessed to date and previously identified as
interacting with one or more toxicant/toxins. We contend that these commonly functionally compromised
genes are most likely to impact human response to a toxin/toxicant in a significant proportion of people. We

10980999,"People vary considerably in their response to and in the effects of exposure to chemical toxicants and
biological toxins. As a result, the risk of adverse outcomes associated with exposure for different individuals
and populations can be widely divergent. Gene by environment (G x E) interactions likely underlie a significant
component of these risk differences. However, we remain largely ignorant of both the key genetic factors and
the mechanistic association with specific toxins/toxicants. As a result, our capability to mitigate risk by the
identification of susceptible individuals and populations to enable effective preventive efforts remain sorely
limited. Current approaches to identify G x E interactions rely on genetic association studies which generally
lack sufficient power to identify significant associations, due to the large number of genetic variants and small
populations of exposed individuals. We propose, in a fundamentally different approach, to first systematically
identify the common human variants which impact the functional response to a specific toxicant/toxin to
delineate key candidate G X E interactions for targeted consideration in relevant individuals and populations.
We will focus on functional interrogation of 1490 genes, the ToxVar set, which contain an aggregate frequency
of loss of function mutations of >0.1% in all human populations assessed to date and previously identified as
interacting with one or more toxicant/toxins. We contend that these commonly functionally compromised
genes are most likely to impact human response to a toxin/toxicant in a significant proportion of people. We
will simultaneously query the impact of functional disruption in each of these 1490 genes on the cellular

10726586,"This is the first competing renewal application for my RCS Award. My lab has been engaged in the field of eye
research for >37 years; I’ve been a tenured full Professor since 1994. Historically, our focus has been on
understanding the normal role of cholesterol and related isoprenoid compounds in promoting and preserving the
structure and function of the retina. However, more recently (during the RCS Award period), we’ve turned to
studies relevant to traumatic injury to the eye and visual system. Eye injuries resulting in compromised or lost
vision are among the signature injuries sustained by our Veterans and deployed soldiers engaged in the recent
conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan (OEF, OIF). Currently, about 170,000 Veterans are legally blind, and nearly 1.5
million have some kind of visual deficit that is battle-related. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is another signature
injury of those conflicts; a significant percentage of TBI patients suffer visual deficits, nearly a third of which are
blast-induced. My lab’s goal is to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these kinds of
trauma-induced vision loss, and to find practical pharmacological interventions to prevent or retard their
progression. Those studies are funded by an ongoing VA MERIT Award. In addition, we’re investigating a form
of retinitis pigmentosa (RP59)— a hereditary progressive blinding disorder— about which little is known, initially
in an effort to understand the causes of the associated retinal degeneration at the molecular level and eventually
to develop gene therapy approaches to ameliorate or prevent the degeneration and vision loss. Those studies
are supported by an ongoing NEI/NIH R01 grant award. I’ve been a VA Research Service staff member at the
Buffalo VAMC since July, 2008, and an RCSA recipient since April, 2016. I hold a tenured endowed chair
Professorship and am Vice-Chair/Director of Research in the Dept. of Ophthalmology at the affiliated university
(SUNY- University at Buffalo (UB)). I am the only person in the history of my department to become a UB
Distinguished Professor and a SUNY Distinguished Professor, and I am the sole RCSA recipient at my VA site.
Over the years, I’ve been fortunate to have numerous, productive collaborations, both with VA and non-VA
researchers, including current, ongoing projects, and have a strong history of extramural grant funding. I’ve
authored or coauthored 129 peer-reviewed publications (+2 in press, + 2 under review)— 38% of which have
been published since I joined the VA— plus 10 book chapters and 242 conference abstracts. I’ve given 241
invited lectures (120 while on VA staff) at other universities and research institutions, plus 65 platform
presentations (15 while on VA staff) at biomedical research conferences, nationally and internationally. I’ve
engaged in multiple service activities— to the VA (local and national), my university, and the broader research
community— including service on VA, NIH, DOD (CDMRP), and private foundation grant review panels. I also
serve on the Scientific Advisory Board of Foundation Fighting Blindness (FFB). I’ve been elected President of
the two leading international eye and vision research professional societies (ARVO and ISER), and serve as
Editor-in-Chief of one of the top two eye research journals (Exp. Eye Res.), as well as serving as a peer reviewer
for >4 dozen journals. I teach actively in the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program of my university, both on
scientific topics (Cell Biology and Biochemistry) as well as Responsible Conduct in Research. I’ve mentored
numerous undergraduate, graduate, and medical students, as well as postdocs and Ophthalmology Residents
in my lab (currently: 2 postdocs, 1 medical student, 1 undergrad). I also actively mentor all junior faculty in my

10726587,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Effective HIV vaccines are not yet available. Of the phase 2b/3 vaccine trials, only the Thai RV144 trial
showed efficacy (31%, p=0.04), and high levels of antibodies (Abs) against the V1V2 domain of HIV envelope
(Env) were found to be the only primary immune correlate of reduced virus acquisition. Studies of vaccines in
SIV or SHIV-challenged monkeys have since recapitulated these findings. To improve upon the RV144 vaccine,
we have designed V1V2-targeted vaccine candidates and identified the most immunogenic: V1V2/A244-2J9C,
a protein with V1V2 of CRF_01.AE strain A244 spliced into a bacterial trimeric protein scaffold, 2J9C. With our
unique vaccine strategy centered on targeting V1V2 using novel recombinant subunit immunogens, we have
demonstrated the capacity to induce an Ab response in plasma and vaginal secretion that was focused on V1V2
and diverted from other more immunodominant sites on Env. The elicited Abs displayed cross-reactivity with
strains from multiple clades, durability of 1-2 years after the last boost, and antiviral functions including Ab-
dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement
activation—activities that are not readily achieved by immunization with intact gp120. V1V2/A244-2J9C DNA has
also been shown as an effective prime, focusing the Ab response on the specific V2 region that accounted for
reduced infection in RV144. Altogether these data provide evidence supporting the validation of our lead vaccine
candidate and vaccination approach. A US patent has been issued for our V1V2-scaffold designs, with the VA
as one of the assignees.
 This application proposes to produce the lead immunogen V1V2/A244-2J9C under cGMP (current Good
Manufacturing Practice) as both DNA plasmid and protein, and test its optimized delivery in order to pave the
way toward a human phase I clinical trial. To accomplish this goal, four specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 is to
generate a master bank of E. coli transformed with the V1V2/A244-2J9C-expressing DNA plasmid. In Aim 2 we
will test the cGMP-grade V1V2/A244-2J9C-encoding DNA for protein production in transiently transfected 293T
cells and for immunogenicity in rabbits. In vitro protein analysis will include expression efficiency, mass,
oligomerization, glycosylation, stability, and reactivity with a panel of monoclonals Abs (mAbs). Aim 3 is to
produce a master bank of HEK293T GnTi-/- cells and a pilot batch of V1V2/A244-2J9C protein using the plasmid
from Aim 1. Finally, Aim 4 will test purification methods and conduct in vitro analysis for V1V2/A244-2J9C protein
from Aim 3 and then perform in vivo rabbit immunogenicity testing with V1V2/A244-2J9C DNA and protein.
 The cGMP production will be done by Waisman BioManufacturing, associated with the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, under the supervision of Drs. Carl A. Ross and Brian M. Dattilo. In vitro immunogen analysis,
protein purification, rabbit vaccination, and immune assessment will be performed in the laboratory of Dr.
Catarina Hioe (PI, James J. Peters VA Medical Center, JJP VAMC) in collaboration with Dr. Susan Zolla-Pazner
(Mount Sinai School of Medicine, MSSM).
 The V1V2/A244-2J9C DNA and protein immunogens will be the first of their kind to move toward clinical
trials. An effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection and/or disease is an essential portion of the Strategic National
Vaccine Plan of the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs. An HIV vaccine is
invaluable to protect Veterans who are at risk at home and abroad. This vaccine could as well serve as a
prototype for vaccines against other diseases, like COVID19, where a focused Ab response to specific epitopes
is requisite for protection."

10843968,"Persistent infection with high-risk HPVs cause multiple human cancers; however there are no antivirals to treat these diseases. An increased understanding of the virus-host interactions that regulate the viral life cycle may reveal novel approaches for therapeutic development. Upon infection, HPV genomes transiently amplify to 50- 100 episomal copies per cell that are stably maintained. Epithelial differentiation triggers productive replication, resulting in amplification of viral genomes to 100s-1000s of copies/cell. We have shown that the ATM-dependent DNA damage response (DDR) promotes recruitment of homologous recombination (HR) repair factors (e.g. BRCA1, Rad51) to HPV genomes to facilitate productive replication. Despite an increase in cellular double-strand breaks (DSBs) upon differentiation, HPV genomes are preferentially repaired, though the mechanistic basis for this is unknown. We recently demonstrated that the DDR ubiquitin ligase RNF168 is specifically required for viral genome amplification upon differentiation. RNF168 is recruited to DSBs by ATM signaling. RNF168 plays a critical role in the DDR by catalyzing histone ubiquitination to recruit DNA repair proteins, including 53BP1 and BRCA1, both of which localize to HPV replication foci. How HPV uses RNF168 activity to drive viral replication is unclear, although several recent studies have implicated RNF168 in HR repair. The HPV E7 protein interacts directly with RNF168, disrupting repair at cellular DSBs. E7 may sequester RNF168 from cellular DSBs to direct RNF168 activity to viral chromatin, promoting preferential recruitment of HR factors to viral DNA upon differentiation. However, RNF168-mediated 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs poses a block to HR initiation that HPV must overcome. BRCA1 recruitment to post-replicative chromatin in S/G2 phases antagonizes this block by redistributing 53BP1. We have found that 53BP1 is redistributed at HPV DNA foci upon differentiation, implicating BRCA1 in promoting HR initiation on viral chromatin. Interestingly, our preliminary studies indicate that DNA-PK, a kinase critical for error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), may contribute to viral genome amplification by repressing cellular DSB repair pathways that could interfere with HR factor recruitment to viral DNA. We hypothesize HPV reshapes the cellular DNA damage response upon differentiation to support HR on viral chromatin. In this proposal, we will test if RNF168 promotes productive replication through HR factor recruitment to viral chromatin and determine if the E7-RNF168 interaction facilitates this process. We will also determine if the HPV-mediated increase in RNF168 protein stability influences viral replication. We will determine if BRCA1 monitors the state of post-replicative viral DNA to direct repair to HR by removing 53BP1. Additionally, we will define the interplay between HR and NHEJ during productive replication by determining if DNA-PK activity provides a cellular environment that protects HR factor recruitment to viral DNA. Understanding how HPV directs HR activity to viral DNA at the expense of cellular DNA repair will provide insight into mechanisms of viral replication and pathogenesis and may identify novel therapeutic targets to disrupt the viral life cycle."

The vestibular system utilizes specialized hair cells for sensing gravity and head motions. Vestibular hair cells
have been broadly characterized into two cell types: Type I and Type II. Clear differences also exist among the
zones of vestibular organs, consisting of a central zone surrounded by a peripheral zone of hair cells. How the
mechanotransduction machinery varies across these two cell types or zones is poorly understood. Existing
evidence suggests that the striolar (central) versus extrastriolar (peripheral) zones serve different functions such
as sensing high versus low frequencies. How these functional differences are achieved at the molecular level is
not clear. The aim of this proposal is to characterize the mechanotransduction complex in the different hair cells
and zones of the utricle, a vestibular organ that is vital for sensing gravity and head motions. We have preliminary
data that demonstrate differential expression of transcripts encoding a key component of the mechanotransduction
complex: transmembrane channel-like proteins (TMC1 and TMC2). In zebrafish and the mouse, both Tmc1 and
Tmc2 genes are expressed in regional gradients that correlate with the striolar and extrastriolar zones of the utricle.
We aim to determine the dynamic developmental and adult patterns of Tmc1/2 expression along with other
members of the mechanotransduction complex. We also intend to correlate these expression patterns with hair
bundle morphology and hair cell physiology. In addition, we will examine these features of TMC expression and
other components of the mechanotransduction complex in human utricular hair cells. Determining the extent of
conservation of these features among species will be essential for the interpretation of animal models and how
they inform approaches to regeneration of vestibular hair cells or other therapeutic methods for vestibular
dysfunction in human patients."

Rhodopsins are G-protein coupled proteins that initiate signal transduction in response to light exposure. There
is significant interest in understanding Rhodopsin homeostasis because dysfunctional Rhodopsins are among
the most frequent causes of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), a genetic disorder with age-related retinal degeneration.
Among those associated with RP are Rhodopsin mutants with impaired protein folding properties. Because
Rhodopsins undergo synthesis and folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such Rhodopsin mutants could
impose stress on this organelle. Those conditions activate an adaptive signaling response that regulates gene
expression, widely referred to as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). One particular UPR signaling branch
relevant to this proposal is the one mediated by the ER stress sensor PERK and its downstream effector ATF4.
Among others, UPR signaling induces the expression of genes that help fold or degrade misfolded proteins in the
ER, thereby affecting retinal degeneration in RP. The basic mechanisms of UPR signaling, Rh1 homeostasis,
and retinal degeneration are conserved in Drosophila melanogaster. Specifically, Drosophila ninaE encodes the
Rhodopsin-1 (Rh1) protein expressed in adult eye photoreceptors. A mutant allele of this gene, ninaEG69D, serves
as a model for RP as it imposes ER stress, activates the UPR, and dominantly causes age-related retinal
degeneration. The long-term goal of this project is to harness the genetic and genomic tools of Drosophila to
understand the role of UPR in retinal degeneration. Here, I propose to investigate new UPR signaling branches
that may significantly change our understanding of Rhodopsin homeostasis and retinal degeneration. In Specific
Aims 1 and 2, I propose to re-evaluate the widespread idea that ATF4 is the primary downstream effector of
PERK-mediated UPR. Arguing against this, we recently identified a new sub-branch of the PERK pathway
mediated by Xrp1, a bZIP transcription factor. How Xrp1 is regulated and whether it affects retinal degeneration
remains unclear. We will specifically test the hypothesis that Xrp1 is translationally induced by PERK. We will
determine if such induction affects the course of retinal degeneration and whether Xrp1 requires
heterodimerization partners to regulate some or all downstream target genes. I further propose to identify the
human equivalent of the Xrp1 heterodimer complex. In Aim 3, I propose to investigate a possible link between ER
stress and endosome trafficking in the RP model. Most UPR studies have focused on its role in ER homeostasis.
However, our recent gene expression profiling results reveal that ninaEG69D/+ photoreceptors also induce many
endosomal trafficking regulators. I propose to determine if those endosomal factors are induced by the UPR or
by other unconventional signaling pathways. We will further determine if those pathways affect Rhodopsin
homeostasis and the course of retinal degeneration in this RP model. A successful outcome of these plans may
help significantly change our current understanding of UPR signaling pathways and retinal degeneration in RP."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of Tuberculosis (TB), is the leading cause of human mortality
due to an infectious disease, outside of the COVID-19 pandemic. The limited knowledge on risk factors and
comorbidities for TB progression and the mechanisms by which these promote susceptibility limits the ability to
develop new prevention and treatment approaches. Recently, we published data showing a causal relationship
between vitamin A deficiency and progression to clinical active TB disease, carrying up to a 10-fold higher risk
for human TB progression. The substantial TB risk associated with vitamin A deficiency highlights the need to
understand the mechanisms by which this molecule contributes to TB pathogenesis, particularly in the context
of malnutrition among TB-affected communities, which are often the same communities affected by vitamin A
deficiency. Vitamin A has been shown to have an impact on both innate and cell-mediated immunity, where
diverse roles in immunity convolute the potential contributions of this molecule to TB immunity. We hypothesize
that vitamin A is required for effective cell-mediated immunity to control infection after exposure, and respond
properly to vaccination, requiring production within the lung for development of effective immunity. The goals of
this research are to better understand the contribution of vitamin A bioavailability to the development of the
immune response, the metabolic perturbations of vitamin A during infection that may limit bioavailability, and
how vitamin A status impacts efficacies of BCG vaccination practices. These goals will be achieved through
three Aims using a guinea pig model of vitamin A deficiency developed in our laboratory. We will first determine
the contribution of vitamin A bioavailability to the development of the coordinated granuloma immune response
using single cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches on infected guinea pig lung tissues. Next, we will evaluate
cellular, organ-level, and systemic vitamin A metabolic patterns during infection using stable heavy isotope
tracing methods in the guinea pig model throughout the course of infection. Finally, the impact of vitamin A on
protective efficacy of BCG vaccination, the only vaccine available for TB, will be assessed under conditions of
physiologic and pathologic neonatal vitamin A deficiencies. Upon completing these experiments, we will have
determined the role of vitamin A in the development of the granuloma and cell mediated immunity, the
requirements for, and availability of, vitamin A at the site of infection in the lung, and the impact of existing and
proposed human vitamin A supplementation programs on the efficacy of BCG vaccination. These results will
elucidate mechanisms of TB disease progression, identify the role of vitamin A in TB immunity and propose
informed options for preventive or therapeutic intervention on vitamin A deficiency."

CD19 targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) have revolutionized cellular immunotherapy in
refractory B-cell malignancies such as B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (B-NHL) and B-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (B-ALL). Despite high rates of complete remissions, relapses, 50% of which within the first year,
remain a critical challenge highlighting the need for novel CAR-T cell products. Two patterns of relapse are
observed: (i) Antigen-negative relapses, caused by target antigen loss and (ii) antigen-positive relapses, which
are mediated by lack of persistence or loss of function of the CAR-Ts. Commercial CD19 CAR-Ts employ
either a CD28 or a 4-1BB costimulatory domain however, a novel OX-40 domain has been shown to promote
persistence, cytotoxicity and decrease exhaustion. Finally, increasing evidence suggests that stem-like
memory T cell phenotype in the CAR-T product is associated with more durable responses. Schneider et. al
developed a Trispecific CD19, CD20, CD22-targeting CAR-Ts with an OX-40 costimulatory domain and
showed significant activity in preclinical lymphoma models compared to CD19 CAR-Ts. We validated these
findings with in-house manufactured Trispecific CAR-Ts and confirmed their specificity, cytotoxicity, and
immunophenotypic fitness in preclinical B-cell lymphoma models. Our proposal seeks to address the limitations
of commercial CD19 CAR-Ts through a first-in-human in-house manufactured Trispecific CAR-Ts with an OX-
40 costimulatory domain for relapsed, refractory B-cell malignancies. These trispecific CAR-Ts are
manufactured in the Ohio State University Cell therapy laboratory using the CliniMACS Prodigy device over a
6-day manufacturing process which allows for infusion of stem-like memory CAR-Ts. We hypothesize that
trispecific CARTs will (i) reduce the risk of relapse mediated by antigen negative clonal escape; (ii) enhance
persistence of CAR-Ts which will translate into deeper and more durable clinical responses. To address this,
we propose two Aims. In Aim 1, we aim to conduct a first-in-human phase I trial with in-house manufactured
trispecific CAR-Ts in patients with relapsed/refractory B-NHL, B-ALL, B-prolymphocytic leukemia, and chronic
lymphocytic leukemia. Primary endpoints are feasibility, safety of trispecific CAR-Ts along with establishing a
recommended phase II dose. Secondary endpoints are efficacy and duration of response. In Aim 2, we aim to
identify key mechanisms of efficacy and resistance to trispecific CAR-Ts. Specifically, we plan to assess: (i)
persistence of CAR-Ts and its correlation with complete remission rates, duration of response as well as
incidence and severity of adverse events; (ii) immunophenotypic and transcriptional features of impaired
function of CAR-Ts and other mononuclear cells using state of the art high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry
and CITE-sequencing.
At completion of this project, our work will have established feasibility of in-house manufacturing of trispecific
CAR-Ts and provided insights into mechanisms of relapse and efficacy."
10909354,"As defects in fetal adrenal (FAd) development can result in life threatening primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI),
understanding the cellular and gene regulatory mechanisms governing this process is essential. While much has
been learned about FAd development in rodent models, species-specific developmental differences limit our
understanding of this process in humans. As mechanistic evaluation in human embryos is untenable, we recently
developed the first human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived FAd organoid system that
recapitulates normal functional development and steroidogenesis. Using this system, we will undertake the
first perturbative and reverse genetic assessment of human FAd development, allowing us to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of human adrenocortical development, which has broad implications in providing
essential insight into mechanisms driving PAI. Development of the human adrenal cortex starts with specification
of the adrenal primordium (AP) from the coelomic epithelium (CE), followed by establishment of the definitive
zone (DZ) with putative stem cell/progenitor potential, and the fetal zone (FZ) with steroidogenic potential. Our
recent single cell RNA-seq analysis of the human FAd cortex supports FZ replenishment by the DZ and the
observed expression of Wnt ligands/activators in the peripherally located capsule (Cap) is suggestive of niche
function. To mechanistically assess human FAd development and understand genetic defects (e.g., NR5A1,
WNT4 mutations) driving PAI, we utilized our FAd organoid system. While the transcription factor NR5A1 impacts
early FAd cell fate and promotes steroidogenesis in a gene-dose dependent manner in mice, its role in human
FAd appears more complex. Our preliminary studies show that induced NR5A1 null mutant organoids fail to
differentiate into AP-like cells (APLCs), exhibit decreased survival, fail to upregulate the receptor for
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and that the steroidogenic potential of the remaining cells is limited. In
wild-type FAd organoids, we find that formation of DZ-like cells (DZLCs) is enhanced by the removal of Wnt
inhibitor/addition of Wnt agonist. We also find that WNT4 and RSPO3 are highly expressed in both human Cap
in vivo and Cap-like cells (CapLCs) in FAd organoids. Intriguingly, we find that DZLC formation is enhanced by
sonic hedgehog (SHH), a trophic factor for murine Cap, suggesting a potential SHH-driven niche function for the
Cap that is further supported by the observed upregulation of SHH target genes in human Cap. Finally, we find
that both FACS-sorted DZ and DZLCs readily differentiate into FZ-like cells (FZLCs) upon ACTH stimulation,
supporting the ability of DZLCs to replenish FZLCs. However, as Wnt-target gene expression is maintained in
the subcapsular DZ despite exposure to ACTH, it suggests that Cap-derived Wnt signaling antagonizes ACTH-
mediated differentiation of DZLCs. Using our organoid system, we will test the central hypothesis that dose-
sensitive NR5A1 activity promotes development of the AP and that Wnt signaling provided by SHH-
dependent responses in Cap both induces DZ development and antagonizes ACTH-driven FZ formation."

Low-income older adults (LIOA) are a population at higher risk to develop Alzheimer's disease and related
dementias (ADRD) and sleep disturbances. Although empirical research suggests that physical activity
interventions benefit cognition and sleep in older adults in general, the possible benefit of physical activity is
understudied in LIOA. The available evidence in LIOA suggests that LIOA experience unique barriers to
physical activity, more prevalent physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors. Since physical inactivity and
sedentary behaviors are independent risk factors that have synergistic harmful effects for cognitive function
and sleep, it is crucial to address them simultaneously to promote cognitive and sleep health in LIOA. The
growing wearable device and mobile Health (mHealth) provide an innovative approach to deliver individually
tailored physical activity interventions at home with flexible schedules to overcome barriers to physical activity
in LIOA. In addition, limited research has examined if physical activity interventions impact the individual’s
Amyloid/Tau/ Neurodegeneration (ATN) Alzheimer's disease biological state and whether physical activity may
promote cognition through impacting sleep and AD pathology. This randomized controlled trial is designed to
examine the immediate and sustaining efficacy of an mHealth-facilitated Physical Activity Toward Health
(mPATH) intervention on cognitive function and sleep in LIOA. mPATH is a personalized physical activity
intervention that includes personalized physical activity plans and training sessions, exercise at home by
following personalized exercise videos, and biweekly phone coaching over 24 weeks, supported by wearable
devices-enabled mHealth strategies. mHealth strategies and exercise videos will be used to support
participant’s physical activity during 6-12months. In the proposed study, we will randomize 176 community
dwelling LIOA with insomnia symptoms and without dementia to the mPATH or control group on a 1:1 ratio.
Randomization will be stratified by age, sex, and cognitive status. Specifically, we will (1) test the immediate (6-
month) and sustaining (12-month) effects of mPATH on cognitive function among LIOA, compared to control;
(2) test the immediate (6-month) and sustaining (12-month) effects of mPATH on sleep, compared to control;
and (3) explore the effect of mPATH on ATN biomarkers and potential mediating roles of sleep and ATN
biomarkers in mPATH’s effect on episodic memory."

IgE antibodies and receptors are important mediators of the allergic cascade, but may also provide distinct
functions in anti-tumor immunotherapy. IgE engages its high affinity IgE Fc receptor (FceRI) on mast cells and
basophils as well as a low affinity receptor (FceRII/CD23) expressed on B cells and epithelial cells. IgE binding
to FceRI sensitizes allergic effector cells to allergens and is very stable, with the complexes persisting for
months even in the presence of potent anti-IgE antibodies. We have developed approaches to rapidly
destabilizing IgE:FceRI complexes and desensitizing allergic effector cells using hybrid, bispecific IgG/DARPin
molecules that recognize two distinct epitopes on the IgE-Fc. Here in Aim 1 we will explore alternative
approaches to target and remove IgE:FceRI complexes from cell surfaces using novel bispecific anti-IgE
antibodies. In addition, we will use two anti-IgE antibodies that we have produced to gain greater insights into
the structure and dynamics of intact IgE. The IgE interaction with CD23 also mediates important biological
effects in B cells, together with CD21. Here, in Aim 2, we will use yeast display to evolve higher affinity variants
of CD23 for its ligands to enable structural studies of these complexes and to probe CD23-dependent
regulation of IgE production by B cells. Finally, in Aim 3, we seek to isolate and study new anti-FceRIa
antibodies using yeast display, to develop novel reagents for the FceRI-directed modulation of allergic effector
cell activities."

Functional precision oncology is the practice of assessing the phenotype of biopsied tumor cells upon
perturbation, e.g. treatment with candidate therapies, to yield actionable information fast enough to influence
clinical decision making. For a functional precision approach to provide actionable information on tumors’
response to candidate therapeutics, it must: retain specimen heterogeneity, monitor all biologically important
phenotypes, make longitudinal observations, and - since clonal expansion of individual cells is sufficient to drive
tumor progression or resistance – have single cell resolution. One example where functional precision oncology
could be valuable is the choice of therapy for the approximately 50% of melanoma patients harboring the
BRAFV600E mutation. Such patients have two options – immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) or targeted therapy
(TT). Either strategy is capable of curing patients in many cases but neither option works for all patients. Poor
response to either is caused by the pre-existence and/or emergence of phenotypes resistant to each therapeutic
option. A clinical test that could predict, on a personalized level, which patients are likely to respond or acquire
resistance to either of these therapies is among the most pressing clinical needs in melanoma care. On a
population level, more patients present with durable response to ICI than to TT, and so ICI is the default standard
of care and a predictive test must achieve high accuracy to influence clinical decision making. We have pioneered
the use of quantitative phase imaging (QPI) for rapid and label-free phenotype assessment of melanoma cells,
including monitoring for therapeutic resistance. Our area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC)
for predicting resistance under 48 h is 0.84-0.90 – which is promising, but insufficient and needs validation. We
propose to construct a new technological and analytical platform with two modifications. First, we will augment
QPI with a second imaging module to measure light scatter via a new method we have developed based on
darkfield microscopy. Light scatter is traditionally measured using flow cytometry and is predictive of relevant
cell phenotypes in a myriad of cancer types, including, our preliminary data show, therapeutic resistance in
melanoma. Second, we will establish an analytical pipeline for assessing cell state dynamics which we anticipate
will yield a classifier that is more accurate across heterogeneous biopsies as compared to current approaches.
In this proposal, we describe a series of engineering and analytical steps, coupled with technical milestones and
target quantitative goals benchmarked against existing approaches for developing an approach we call
Quantitative Imaging of Cell state Kinetics (QuICK), as well as a proof of principle study using clinical biopsies.
If successful, we will have built a prototype platform with high potential to improve the care of melanoma patients
through accurate personalized matching to the best therapy and we will be well situated for prospective clinical
trials. In addition, QuICK has the potential to inform functional precision medicine approaches for other cancers
that would benefit from rapid classification of live cell phenotypes with single cell resolution."
10894274,"Plugging & Pulling-in: tuning peptides for TolC to overcome antibiotic resistance
Summary
Antibiotic resistant infections already kill more people per year than HIV/AIDS or malaria. Clinical antibiotic
resistance is correlated with the overexpression of particular efflux pumps. These efflux pumps shuttle out
most classes of antibiotics so that the antibiotics can’t reach their targets, reducing their effectiveness. The
most accessible part of the efflux pump is its outer membrane barrel. The outer membrane barrel
accessibility makes it a good target for pharmaceutical development because it can be accessed without
getting through the often impermeable outer membrane. The efflux pump presents as both a possible target
for stopping antibiotic efflux and a possible avenue of drug delivery. Plugging efflux pumps would make the
antibiotics we already have work like new by stopping antibiotics from being removed from the cell and
allowing them to reach their targets. Hijacking the barrel for cellular import could be used to deliver drugs that
otherwise could not cross the bacterial outer membrane. Our long term goal is to develop peptides to combat
antibiotic resistant infection. The objective of the proposed research is to determine 1) what protein-protein
interactions are necessary to create high affinity plugs and 2) what protein-protein interactions can facilitate
peptide transit through the pump. We have recently solved the first structure of an exogenous protein binding
the outer membrane barrel of the E. coli antibiotic resistance. It is an unusual helix-in-barrel structure. We
have shown that the binding of this protein has some ability to act as a plug. It stops efflux and make
antibiotics more potent. We have also created databases of outer membrane barrels to better understand the
sequence structure relationships in these proteins. Here we propose to leverage these past successes to 1)
Identify common sequence and structural barrel-peptide interactions for antibiotic efflux pump-like proteins 2)
Screen for peptides that bind well to the E. coli antibiotic efflux pump and identify the features that determine
that binding, and 3) Identify what would facilitate the translocation of proteins across the efflux pump that
otherwise bind to the efflux pump. The global concept of this work, creating new plugs and translocators for
membrane β-barrels, has, to our knowledge, never been done before. The expected outcomes of these
experiments are a knowledge of how protein-protein interactions facilitate plugging and pulling through of
antibiotic efflux pumps, as well as the creation of peptides that plug or pull through TolC. This work is poised
to make a significant contribution because it will demonstrate the important protein-protein interactions
necessary to create membrane protein plugs and translocators and can thereby enable a revival of existing
antibiotics against resistant superbugs."
10888383,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Substantial progress in psychiatric genomics has led to the identification of several copy number variants
(CNVs) and single genes that are associated with extremely high risk for schizophrenia. A major question facing
the field now is whether these discrete genomic loci all act independently or disrupt a common set of
neurobiological pathways to produce a similar clinical phenotype. Studies on the effects of the 3q29 deletion, a
CNV that confers >40-fold increased risk for schizophrenia, indicate that mitochondrial function may be disrupted
in the developing central nervous system. Strikingly, the CNV with the next strongest risk for schizophrenia
(22q11.2Del) has also been reported to produce mitochondrial phenotypes. In addition to the 3q29 and 22q11.2
deletion, at least nine other neurodevelopmental disorder-associated CNV loci also contain genes that encode
mitochondrial proteins. These data motivate the hypothesis that neural mitochondria may be a site of convergent
biology downstream of schizophrenia-risk CNVs. This career development project is designed to address this
hypothesis with extensive new training in mitochondrial neurobiology. I have developed a unique set of isogenic
human induced pluripotent stem cell lines that, in combination with mouse experimental models of each CNV,
will be leveraged to test the hypothesis that 3q29 and 22q11.2 deletion similarly disrupt mitochondrial function
in the developing nervous system.
 The goals of this project are to define the extent of mitochondrial phenotypes produced by these
schizophrenia-associated CNVs and to determine the degree of biological convergence at molecular and
functional levels. To this end we will assess the effects of each CNV on the proteome of mitochondria isolated
from CNV-model mouse brain and isogenic human cortical organoids. Additionally, the transition from glycolysis
to oxidative phosphorylation is a critical stage of neuronal development. We will test the capacity of 3q29 deletion
and 22q11.2 deletion neural progenitor cells to adapt to metabolic stress by using media formulations to force
cultures to either utilize glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation to meet energy demands. Finally, we will utilize
an engineered heterologous cell system to screen for gene drivers of 3q29 mitochondrial phenotypes. These
experiments will yield important data related to the concept of convergent biology, a timely and significant
question in translational psychiatry which could have profound effects on our understanding of risk alleles and
future therapeutic approaches."
10930080,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gender minority young adults (GMYA; 18-25 years old), who have a gender that is different than their assigned
sex at birth, have 3-4 times greater risk of depression and anxiety than those whose gender is congruent with
their assigned sex at birth (i.e., cisgender). The accumulation of gender minority stress (GM stress), stress due
to stigma related to one’s gender identity and/or expression is one proposed cause of this disparity. GM stress
can become internalized, and feelings of shame and repetitive thoughts (rumination) can make mental health
worse. Despite the known associations between GM stress, mental health, shame and rumination, few
interventions exist to address GM stress in GMYA. Self-compassion, treating oneself with kindness instead of
self-criticism in painful or difficult times, has been identified as a useful strategy to alleviate GM stress among
GM people, and is a trait that can be strengthened. Mindful self-compassion (MSC), an 8-week intervention,
combining mindfulness and self-compassion skills is one way to increase self-compassion. However, MSC has
not yet been tested with GYMA and it is not known whether gender dysphoria (distress due to body not
matching identity) could make it difficult to fully engage with body-based practices. My long-term research goal
is to improve the mental health and wellbeing of GMYA by identifying, and intervening on, modifiable risk and
protective factors using community-engaged, trauma-informed interventions. The current project builds upon
my prior cross-sectional research on GMYA’ mental health by exploring the feasibility of an existing
intervention with a new population. The objective for this proposal is to obtain training and certification as an
MSC teacher as well as additional skills in trauma-informed mindfulness and embodied practice, intervention
science (implementation, evaluation, and adaptation), advanced data analysis, and community engaged
research. With guidance from my mentors, I will pursue the following specific aims: 1) evaluate the feasibility of
an 8-week MSC intervention and data collection plan (pre-, post-, 3-month follow-up) with 5 consecutive
groups of GMYA, 2) evaluate the usability of MSC intervention activities by GMYA and determine whether
MSC activities need to be tailored for GMYA, and 3) explore GMYA’s pre- and post- intervention and 3-month
follow-up data to examine whether shame, rumination, self-compassion, depression, and anxiety are sensitive
to change. The goals of this project are consistent with NCCIH’s interest in mind-body interventions to help
reduce stress, anxiety, and depression among sexual and gender minority populations (NOT-MD-22-012),
objectives to advance science on health promotion, resilience, and symptom management (Obj. 3), and
commitment to research with diverse populations and a diverse scientific workforce (Obj. 4). Under the
guidance of expert mentors in the population, methods, approaches, and with a strong history of research
funding- the proposed project will provide me with the necessary skills to independently conduct rigorous
complementary and integrative health research to improve mental health and wellbeing among GMYA."
10886102,"PROJECT SUMMARY – UCSF IRACDA Scholars Program
The need for increased representation of a diverse workforce in biomedical research at the academic level
is clear and well-documented. This renewal application requests resources to continue our four-year
Scholars training program at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in partnership with San
Francisco State University (SFSU). The program's goal, which began in 2007, is to increase the number of
highly trained, successfully funded, and sustainable research scientists who will perform high-level
laboratory and teaching and increase the diversity of younger trainees to improve our understanding of
health-related science. UCSF has partnered with SFSU to build a program that provides comprehensive
training while fostering impactful exchanges between Scholars, Faculty, and SFSU students.
The critical elements of our training program are (1) a mentored research experience, (2) a mentored
teaching experience at SFSU, (3) monthly career development workshops, (4) cross-disciplinary
scientific/mentoring experiences, and (5) grant writing workshop. The program's centerpiece is 4-years of
training, with the initial three years covered by the training grant and the last year covered by the PI funds or
Independent Awards. Most training (75%) is devoted to an intense research experience. The remaining
effort is dedicated to teaching and mentoring experiences with underrepresented (UR) undergraduate
students at SFSU. Our exceptionally well-qualified research and teaching mentors have committed their
support to the scholars. Internal and external Advisors, as well as periodic formal evaluations, will be a
critical part of the continued excellence and achievement of the stated goals of the Program.
Each Scholar is expected to interact with a team of Faculty Research Mentors and Teaching Mentors during
their training, meeting regularly to assist them in setting and implementing their training and career goals.
Our program has a strong track history of recruiting exceptional scholars from diverse backgrounds. Of the
60 current and past scholars, 85% are UR. Of the 49 Scholars who have completed their training at UCSF,
they have produced an average of 3.3 peer-review publications (0-16 range). More impressive, 59% remain
in academia, with several holding tenure track faculty positions at R1 research-intensive institutions such as
UCSF, Columbia, Brandeis, Brown, Vanderbilt, UT Dallas, UCSD, U of Arkansas, SDSU, SFSU, and SJSU.
In the last funding cycle, Scholars increased external funding by 700%, obtaining ~$750K of NIH or Private
Foundation awards. We believe the Program’s strong outcomes data, the collaborative research-intensive
training environment at UCSF, and the well-established and fruitful interactions between UCSF and SFSU
provide a compelling rationale for renewing and expanding this unique training opportunity to train and
diversify the next generation of leaders in biomedical science."
10728335,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neutrophils are essential for host defense against bacteria, however toxic neutrophil mediators such as
reactive oxygen radicals, granule enzymes and neutrophil extracellular traps contribute the pathogenesis of
acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. While the ability of neutrophils to phagocytose and kill pathogens
has been known for over 100 years, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms guiding neutrophil activation
lags significantly behind that of other immune cells, precluding the development of strategic therapeutic
interventions targeting neutrophils. Our long-term goal is to define the mechanisms by which ion channels and
associated signaling pathways regulate neutrophil activation, and to leverage this knowledge to modify
disease. Calcium signals initiated via store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) are required for neutrophil
activation. The cell membrane potential directly influences influx of positively charged calcium ions. While the
functional role of the cell membrane potential has been extensively studied in excitable cells, little is known
about how the membrane potential modifies cellular processes in neutrophils in the context of development
and inflammation. This proposal is based on four fundamental observations from our laboratory: 1) ORAI1 and
ORAI2 calcium channels are critical for neutrophil SOCE and host defense during infection with S. aureus. 2)
Calcium responses in mouse neutrophils are heterogenous, with the magnitude of the calcium response
modulated in part by differential regulation of the cell membrane potential. 3) Expression of the calcium-
activated potassium channel KCa3.1 (Kcnn4) drives cell hyperpolarization and enhanced SOCE in a subset of
neutrophils. 4) The membrane potential-SOCE relationship is modulated during neutrophil development and
emergency granulopoiesis. Moreover, we have observed that a S. aureus pore-forming toxin manipulates the
neutrophil membrane potential and SOCE. Together these observations illustrate that the membrane potential
is a key modifier of calcium-dependent neutrophil function, and suggest that this pathway is a strategic target
of human pathogenic bacteria that secrete pore-forming cytotoxins to overcome host neutrophil defenses. The
objective of this proposal is to characterize the mechanisms by which membrane potential regulates SOCE
during neutrophil development and inflammation. We will test the central hypothesis that the membrane
potential is a critical modifier of neutrophil calcium signaling in mature neutrophils and homeostatic and
emergency granulopoiesis. In Aims 1 and 2 we will investigate the role of KCa3.1 in neutrophil SOCE and
calcium-dependent activation in mature and developing neutrophils. In Aim 3 we will expand these studies to
investigate how exogenous manipulation of the cell membrane potential by bacterial pore-forming toxins
disrupts calcium-dependent neutrophil function. The insight derived from these studies is anticipated to
engender new clinical opportunities for modulation of neutrophil-dependent infectious and inflammatory
disease, and potentially inform a broader understanding of membrane potential in immune cell function."
10728338,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Gram-negative bacteria are uniquely equipped to defeat antibiotics. Their outermost layer, the cell envelope, is
a natural permeability barrier that contains an array of resistance proteins capable of neutralizing most existing
antimicrobials. As a result, its presence creates a major obstacle both for the treatment of resistant infections
and the development of new antibiotics.
The cell envelope is also home to numerous conserved pathways that safeguard the integrity of its proteome.
Despite the central role of these systems in maintaining protein homeostasis, their interaction with resistance
proteins localizing in the cell envelope has not been examined. We hypothesized that the activity of cell envelope
folding catalysts may be important for the function of resistance determinants, and we tested this hypothesis on
a key proteostasis player, the disulfide bond formation system. We discovered that the oxidative-protein-folding
activity of this pathway is essential for the function of some of the most epidemiologically relevant and clinically
challenging resistance proteins, namely β-lactamases, colistin resistance enzymes, and efflux pumps. Guided
by strong preliminary data obtained from model laboratory strains and from clinical isolates, we propose an in-
depth investigation of the role of cell envelope proteostasis systems in antibiotic resistance. We will use a
combination of bacterial genetics, microbiology, biochemistry, proteomics, experimental evolution, and human
disease modeling to pursue three specific aims: 1) Identify the components of the resistome that rely on oxidative
protein folding, by assessing the requirement for disulfide bond formation on hundreds of clinically important
resistance proteins. 2) Evaluate the impact of oxidative protein folding on resistant infections, by testing our
biochemical findings in clinical isolates and in a relevant murine chronic infection model. 3) Explore the role of
other cell envelope folding catalysts in antibiotic resistance, by probing their function in multidrug-resistant clinical
strains of pathogenic bacteria and validating our results in model laboratory strains.
We expect that our holistic approach, spanning multiple resistance determinants and folding catalysts, will break
new ground in our understanding of the role of cell envelope proteostasis in resistance. This knowledge will be
applicable to many high-priority Gram-negative pathogens and, in the long term, may inspire novel broad-acting
strategies for overcoming antibiotic resistance."
10879172,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Mutations in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling genes such as Fms-Like
Tyrosine Kinase 3 (FLT3) and the KIT proto-oncogene occur in two-thirds of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) and are associated with high relapse rates. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) are clinically active in FLT3-mutant AML but duration of response is limited by the
development of resistance due to re-activation of RAS signaling. No specific proven therapy
exists for these relapsed patients or patients with other signaling mutations. Rationale: The
protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is a central node in RAS activation and propagation of
growth factor signals. SHP2 modulates MAPK pathway activation downstream of RTKs but the
full molecular mechanisms of SHP2 activity are not clear. Small molecule allosteric inhibitors of
SHP2 such as RMC-4630 stabilize the closed, autoinhibited conformation of SHP2 and are in
clinical development. The goal of this application is to leverage new allosteric SHP2 inhibitors
(SHP2i) to elucidate the molecular role of SHP2 in RTK-mediated survival in AML and test the
efficacy of SHP2i in combination with the BCL2 inhibitor (BCL2i) venetoclax. Methods: We will
test the therapeutic efficacy of SHP2i in combination with BCL2i in FLT3 and KIT mutant AML.
We will use single cell multiomic sequencing to discover biomarkers of response and resistance.
Using biochemical and proteomic approaches, we will assess the effect of SHP2i on RTK
signaling in FLT3 and KIT mutant AML cells and associated effects on apoptosis. We will
isolate the role of RAS/MAPK transcriptional activation in SHP2-mediated survival and
determine the role of SHP2 in adhesion-mediated survival signaling in RTK-driven AML.
Expected Results: We anticipate that these studies will uncover new knowledge about the role
of SHP2 in leukemic cell survival and facilitate rational development of SHP2i combination
therapies, particularly in combination with BCL2i. The overall goal of this work is to develop
SHP2 inhibitor therapy as a novel treatment strategy in RTK-driven AML."
10892273,"The eukaryotic cell is a highly compartmentalized structure that is subdivided into distinct functional areas by the
presence of both membrane-bound and membraneless organelles. These latter compartments have also been
referred to as biomolecular condensates. Although most of these membraneless structures have been identified
only recently, condensate formation has been found to be important for many essential processes in the cell. It
is therefore critical that we develop a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying condensate
formation and the nature of their biological activities in the cell.
 We have been addressing these broader issues by studying the biology of one particular condensate,
the Processing body, or P-body. This cytoplasmic granule is highly conserved and contains translationally-
repressed mRNAs and proteins involved in the processing of these transcripts. Our efforts over the past 15 years
have been focused on developing a better understanding of the physiological roles of these granules in the
eukaryotic cell. Studies during the prior grant period furthered this understanding by identifying a potential role
for P-bodies in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Specifically, we found that a distinct subtype of P-body
granule was induced when the integrity of the microtubule network was disrupted. Moreover, our preliminary
data suggest that these granules may be involved in the specific turnover of the TUB mRNAs that encode tubulin
monomers. The experiments in this proposal are organized into two aims that will (1) define the assembly
pathway for these novel granules and (2) determine how their biological activities are regulated.
 The studies in Aim 1 will specifically test a model proposing that these novel granules form as a result of
select P-body components being recruited to the TUB mRNAs. Interestingly, we have found that this latter decay
in S. cerevisiae exhibits the hallmarks of tubulin autoregulation, a process that has been studied for decades in
mammals. However, the decay machinery responsible for this mRNA turnover has not yet been identified.
Therefore, the studies here could provide resolution for a long-standing question in tubulin biology. In Aim 2, we
will examine how the biological activity of a biomolecular condensate can be controlled by specific constituents
of that structure. We will specifically address a key question concerning the role of P-bodies with respect to
mRNA stability. The primary issue is whether P-bodies are sites of decay or long-term storage for the resident
mRNAs. The experiments here will test a model proposing that P-bodies can alternate between these different
activities and that the transition from one state to the other is controlled by protein constituents of the granule,
like the Hrr25 protein kinase. Finally, we will assess the possibility that the P-body decay machinery is portable
and recruited to select messages that are targeted for degradation. In all, the completion of this work should
provide us with a better understanding of the diversity and physiological roles of a conserved biomolecular
condensate in eukaryotic cells."
11176594,"ABSTRACT
Expected increases in the number of older adults, in general with more complex health needs, creates both
challenges and opportunities for health care systems and services to optimize health and well-being. While the
demand on primary care and the continuum of health services changes with age, the need for evidence-based
interventions that respond to the needs of older adults becomes even more apparent. However, the process of
translating evidence to practice is neither automatic nor easy, even when supported by strong evidence. It is
estimated that only 14% of a population receives an intervention even 17 years after efficacy is established.
Targeted activities that integrate researchers, clinicians, healthcare administrators and stakeholders are
needed to accelerate evidence adoption. Even among areas with evidence adoption, significant opportunities
remain in aging research to increase attention to implementation at scale (Stage V of the NIH Stage Model).
Leveraging a partnership across NIA centers and a strong collaboration between Duke and Wake Forest
Universities, we are proposing a conference series to identify, problem solve and address real-world barriers to
research translation. Generating collaboration and engagement opportunities across NIA centers and
investigators could facilitate health system adoption of interventions with new evidence or established
interventions with limited scale. Emphasis is also needed on implementation or de-implementation of
interventions, policies and practices with wide disparities and under- or overuse. Our aims are to (1) engage
researchers to identify and help disseminate interventions for older adults in health care settings with evidence
to maintain or restore independence that have yet to be adopted or reach equitable implementation to scale;
(2) explore innovative and pragmatic strategies to optimize implementation in new collaborative teams; and (3)
provide an annual aging research and health care conference that intersects the application of scientific
methodologies of implementation, improvement and learning health system sciences with health care service
delivery, payment and policy. Our commitment to equity and diversity will help integrate individuals from
different perspectives to bring renewed energy and creativity to overcome gaps in knowledge, therapeutic
inertia, and processes for change. To improve accessibility of the meeting, this series will be held as a pre-
conference to the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Centers (OAIC) Coordinating Center
annual meeting and be facilitated with options for virtual or telephonic remote participation. Our goal—to
stimulate new research-clinical-administrative partnerships that accelerate evidence to impact and advance
healthcare equity—aligns with several of NIA’s strategic directions as we focus on implementation (and de-
implementation) of interventions to improve older adults’ health, well-being and independence and reduce
health disparities."

The burden of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is projected to increase by 150% by the year 2060 to
affect 14 million Americans, with four- and seven-fold increases anticipated among Black and Hispanic/Latino older
adults. To better understand the accumulation of risk throughout the life course and the disparities that exist in ADRD,
studying social and structural determinants of health and employing a life course perspective have been emphasized.
Research on the role of early life stressors and adversity on ADRD is emerging, but still limited. Older adults who
experienced more childhood adversities had greater likelihood of incident dementia in three international aging cohorts;
U.S.-based studies have been largely cross-sectional in design, mixed results have been observed, and only one
examined racial/ethnic differences. However, greater understanding of the role these factors play is imperative if we
aim to mitigate the risk of ADRD with a health equity lens. Identifying early life risk factors for ADRD and the primary
pathways through which childhood adversity is operating will allow for more targeted interventions to reduce risk of
ADRD in later life for the most vulnerable in our population.
In addition, the role of neighborhood deprivation in these relationships remains understudied, despite known
ramifications of environmental factors on health behaviors and outcomes. Understanding structural determinants of
health and how they impact risk of ADRD will provide valuable insight for identifying the most vulnerable communities
for targeting effective prevention strategies and motive for structural changes and policies that aim to improve these
environments and the overall health of those individuals at greatest risk. To have the greatest impact on reducing the
risk of ADRD, the role of the environment must be considered.
In the F99-phase of this proposed research, Adrienne Lee will conduct three novel studies of these complex associations.
Specifically, Adrienne will use the Health and Retirement Study to evaluate the associations of childhood adversity with
neighborhood deprivation, cognitive trajectories, and dementia outcomes within racial/ethnic subgroups. She will link
the study sample to the area deprivation index in midlife to further understand the role of environment and structural
determinants of health on these associations, and to identify population-specific mechanisms by which we can tailor
interventions throughout the life course.
In the K00-phase of this proposed research, Adrienne will build off her dissertation research to identify early life
resilience factors that promote healthy cognitive aging and that may counteract ACE exposure, and she will examine the
associations of ACE exposure, in combination with neighborhood deprivation in relation to other hallmarks of aging. This
research will inform equitable interventions."

10739720,"Background: The Mission Act provides improved Veteran access to care both within the Veterans
Administration (VA) and community systems. An underlying assumption is that faster care with more choices
results in better care. However, care fragmentation is associated with increased length of stay, readmissions,
and mortality. Postoperative complications and readmissions are higher in minority and low socioeconomic
status (SES) patients. Low SES is also associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day
postoperative complications and hospital readmissions. Despite having a profound influence on health
outcomes, social risk factors are absent from risk adjustment for VA quality measures, further exacerbating
disparities in minority and low SES populations. This strategy may further constrain resources to care for
vulnerable populations, as many Veterans are economically disadvantaged and potentially adding avoidable
costs to care delivery. Another major issue is care fragmentation. Nevertheless, the impact of non-VA care and
care fragmentation is absent in performance metrics. Our goal is to identify social risk factors and levels of
care fragmentation that affect surgical outcomes to inform VA quality metric policy and institutional
resource allocation. We improve upon current practice by joining surgical outcomes data with 1) VA/Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) claims data, 2) VA fee-basis files to identify encounters outside of the
VA health system and 3) using more granular proxy social risk factors and neighborhood disadvantage.
Significance/Impact: Our significance is modeling surgical outcomes using social risk factors, rurality, living in
a disadvantaged neighborhood and care fragmentation to identify factors contributing to health care disparities
and to inform VA policy. The impact is to develop quality metrics using social risk factors and care fragmentation.
HSR&D priority areas: Rural Health, Health Equity, Health Care Value and Health Care Informatics.
Innovation: Joining diverse data sources to develop predictive models using both traditional parametric methods
and exploratory machine learning techniques to provide clinicians and administrators with outcomes and
economic analyses necessary to change institutional practices to benefit our most vulnerable Veterans.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Identify factors affecting surgical outcomes by assessing the contributions of ethnicity, race, SES, place
 of residence and care fragmentation to surgical complications, readmissions and mortality
 Hypothesis: Using ethnic/racial minority status, SES, place of residence and care fragmentation will identify
important risk factors for postoperative complications, readmissions, and mortality
Aim 2: Assess the impact of social risk factors and care fragmentation on hospital performance metrics for
 readmissions and mortality
 Hypothesis: Including social risk factors and care fragmentation in risk adjustment models significantly
changes VA hospital performance rankings with respect to readmissions and mortality
Aim 3: Determine the relationship of place of residence, care fragmentation, SES and minority status to acute
 and long-term VA surgical health care utilization to inform VA resource allocation
 Hypothesis: Low SES, rurality, care fragmentation and minority status are associated with higher VA resource
utilization
Methodology: Quantitative analyses using traditional parametric and exploratory machine learning techniques
performed on diverse datasets to develop predictive models of surgical outcomes using care fragmentation,
rurality and social risk factors risk adjusted for medical comorbidities and applied to VA quality metrics.
Implementation/Next Steps: Deployment of quality metric models using social risk factors and care
fragmentation within the VA system. Adjusting resource allocation to account for social risk factors."
10739721,"Background: VA seeks to promote patient-centered care in which Veterans' personal values and goals drive
health care plans. Involving patients in their care can produce better health outcomes. We currently have little
understanding of how Veterans make decisions about returning for repeat screening, including how results of
prior screening tests affect their risk perceptions, and how other sources of information influence adherence
decisions. The Knowledge-Empowerment-Values and Health Belief models have been applied to decisions
about screening uptake. This study will extend that model to account for repeat screening decisions.
Significance: Patients' decisions to engage in routine screening and return for repeat screening are at the
core of the success or failure of VA initiatives to improve screening. Using breast cancer screening (BCS) and
lung cancer screening (LCS) as cases, this work will generate greater understanding of how perceptions of risk
change throughout the screening process. We will develop patient-driven materials for information that can
given to patients prior to screening, as well as included in the reporting of screening results, that can inform
communication between providers and patients decision-making that is Veteran-centered. These findings will
also be able to be extended beyond lung and breast cancer screening to other cancer screening programs.
Innovation and Impact: This study is unique in that we will be using multiple programs of cancer screening
as cases to understand repeat screening decision-making. Lung cancer and breast cancer screening are
cases with important similarities and differences that offer opportunities to more fully examine the many factors
that Veterans consider when deciding to return, or not, for repeat screening. In doing so, we will develop a
broader understanding of how Veterans engage with the screening process and how perceptions of risk
change throughout this process. This may also inform the implementation of shared decision-making and
patient-centered care in screening programs for other conditions that involve repeated routine screenings.
Specific Aims: Aim 1-Characterize elements that influence patients' decisions about repeat cancer screening.
 Aim 1a – Ascertain how veterans who are undergoing lung and breast cancer screening interpret the
results of screening exams, revise their perceptions of risk, and make decisions about repeat LCS and BCS.
 Aim 1b – Identify factors that influence how Veterans make decisions about repeat cancer screening.
The focus will be on determining the variety of sources of information Veterans have utilized as they refine their
perceptions of risk and vulnerability, and an evaluation of the styles and formats they feel would be useful.
Aim 2 – Contrast the perceptions of risk and the screening experiences of Veterans undergoing lung and
breast cancer screening to specify a model of decision-making in repeat cancer screening.
Aim 3 – Develop patient-driven materials and that will optimize patient-centered decisions about repeat cancer
screening.
Methodology: This is a longitudinal qualitative study of Veterans' decisions about returning for repeat
screening for LCS and BCS. The study is designed to optimize informative comparisons between LCS and
BCS toward the development of a generalized understanding of repeat cancer screening decision-making. We
will interview 35 Veterans who have initiated LCS and 35 Women Veterans who have initiated BCS. We will
attempt to interview participants at 3 time points: 1) before initial screening, 2) shortly after initial screening,
and 3) after recommended repeat screening (annual, or surveillance). We will compare and contrast these
experiences to inform development of a conceptual model of repeat cancer screening decision-making.
Next Steps/Implementation: We will work with an expert panel to develop patient-centered materials to
assist Veterans in making decisions about repeat cancer screening. Our operational partners will assist with
disseminating materials to patients and providers through messaging campaigns and other outreach efforts."
10877114,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
It is unknown why some patients regain their pre-morbid health following appropriate treatment for Lyme disease
while others progress to develop post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD). Significant prior published and
preliminary data suggest that variability in clinical, immunologic, and metabolic factors at the onset of infection
with B. burgdorferi contribute to the development of divergent post-treatment outcomes, including PTLD. In this
study, we will draw upon unique cohorts of patients with well-defined PTLD, healthy controls without a history of
Lyme disease, and patients with early Lyme disease followed longitudinally up to 1 year after the end of
treatment. Combining advanced, innovative statistical and laboratory methods, the objective of this grant is to
identify these factors and examine how they relate to underlying symptom phenotypes among patients with
PTLD. To accomplish this goal, we will identify clinically-relevant risk factors associated with post-treatment
outcomes in Lyme disease over time. These factors will then be used to develop an assessment score to identify
patients at increased risk of developing PTLD in the clinical setting (AIM 1). A longitudinal, multivariate, cross-
domain analysis of this sort with the goal of direct translation of findings to clinical practice and the study of
fundamental disease pathways in PTLD has not previously been performed. We will also identify novel auto-
antibodies that are associated with PTLD through protein array, and examine their relationship with underlying
clinical phenotypes (AIM 2). While an autoimmune process has been suspected to underlie the pathogenesis of
PTLD, at least for some individuals, adaptive immune recognition of self-antigens is only beginning to be
described. Discovery of autoantibodies in PTLD may reveal patient subsets marked by specific clinical features,
such as predominant musculoskeletal pain or neurologic symptoms, and identify individuals whose disease is
driven by an autoimmune process. Finally, we will study the longitudinal immunometabolic profile of patients with
differing clinical outcomes using a novel, high-dimensional flow cytometry approach, and hypothesize that
pharmacologic manipulation of perturbed pathways in vitro may be able to normalize a PTLD-associated
metabolic signature (AIM 3). The ability of immunometabolism to globally report on the acute cellular
environment suggests that interrogating immune cell metabolism in individuals develop PTLD in the future could
provide fundamental insights into disease mechanism. Collectively, our studies represent a rigorous approach
towards uncovering determinants that are associated with the outcome of PTLD and its underlying clinical
phenotypes. The long-term goal of this project is to generate fundamental knowledge to inform the development
of innovative therapeutic strategies as well as novel interventions to prevent or reduce the often significant
symptom burden and functional impact of PTLD."
10739245,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE - SUMMARY
The Administrative Core is the key organizational backbone for the Southern California Research Center
for Alcoholic Liver and Pancreatic Diseases (ALPD) and Cirrhosis. It plays an integral role in supporting
the center’s pursuit for the mission of serving as a national resource by achieving efficient networking
and communications among all center components and internal and external oversight committees and
providing required administrative support. The core also identifies and facilitates new programmatic
developments for research on the center theme; promotes new collaborative opportunities among the

training of undergraduate and graduate students, and implementation of 4 community
seminar/workshops and 4 international symposia. With support by the Administration Core, the center
continues to strive as a uniquely specialized, interdisciplinary, and integrated center of excellence
serving regional, national and global communities."
10739246,"PILOT PROJECT CORE - SUMMARY
The center’s Pilot Project Core represents the most critical mechanism to promote new and innovative
investigational endeavors by young and established scientists. It fosters a transition of senior postdocs
and early-stage investigators to the pathway to independence in their chosen research topics related to
the center’s theme. Indeed, since the center’s inception in 1999, the Pilot Project Core has been
responsible for the emergence of the 2nd and 3rd generations of scientists who now lead the center program.
It also supports new leading-edge studies by established investigators who wish to extend their expertise
to ALPD and cirrhosis via collaboration with the center investigators and/or support from the center’s
scientific cores.
 During the past 5 years, the Core received 34 annual pilot project applications of which 19 were funded
with total direct costs of $360,000 for 14 investigators. Of these, 7 acquired NIH (5 R01s, 1 U01, 1 K23)
grants plus 1 DOD grant totaling $8 million direct costs plus $1.9 million foundation or institutional awards.
Six of these 7 awardees are early career Investigators and two other pilot project awardees have pending
R01 and R21 applications. Pilot project investigators published total 34 manuscripts. Further, a USC
MD/PhD student, who has been working on a pilot project under his mentor, has recently received a F30
fellowship award, demonstrating the Pilot Project Program not only supported early-career investigators
but also a pre-doctoral training. These outcomes were strategically supported by chargeback fee-free
services by the center’s technical cores offered to funded projects.
 In the next funding cycle, the Core will continue to promote the generation of young and established
scientists who will advance new basic, translational, and clinical science in the field of ALPD and cirrhosis.
Toward this goal, the Core pursues the following five specific aims: 1) to identify and recruit new and
qualified senior postdocs and young scientists into ALPD and cirrhosis research and support their
transition to academic independence; 2) to identify and recruit established investigators with proven
expertise in other fields into research relevant to the center’s theme and support their acquisition of new
federal grants; 3) To promote unique collaborative projects on selective high-impact topics by uniting the
center investigators’ expertise and shared interest; and 4) to integrate the center’s other supportive
mechanisms such as institutional cost share, core services and educational and training programs to
maximize the potential of pilot projects to mature as competitive studies."
10739305,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Diabetes affects ~23 million people in the US alone with the most prevalent form of the
disease being type-2 diabetes (T2D), which accounts for ~90%, of diagnosed cases. Obesity,
physical inactivity coupled with genetic susceptibility is associated with the rising prevalence of
T2D. The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases 3-fold in diabetes and involves several
factors, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Peripheral artery disease
(PAD) commonly occurs in diabetes and manifests as occlusive arterial disease of the lower
extremities. PAD generally points to poor prognosis because it is indicative of wider CVD risk
especially involving the cerebrovascular, coronary and renovascular systems.
 Vascular smooth muscle cell (myocyte) membrane potential is a major regulator of
arterial contractility. Diabetes can alter the expression and activity of several ion channels in the
vasculature that are associated with intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling. Transmembrane
protein 16A (TMEM16A, Anoctamin1, ANO1) channels are Ca2+-activated chloride (Cl−)
channels that are expressed in arterial myocytes and triggers Cl- efflux, myocyte membrane
depolarization and vasoconstriction. Arterial myocyte ion channel gene expression is tightly
regulated by signaling mechanisms mediated by several transcription factors. A pathological
alteration in these regulatory mechanisms may affect channel expression and induce vascular
dysfunction in diabetes. The role of arterial myocyte ANO1 in the development of diabetic
vascular dysfunction has not been investigated. This application stems from novel and exciting
data of specific signaling mechanisms that regulate Ano1 expression in arterial myocytes to
control arterial contractility. Diabetes-induced dysregulation of these signaling pathways leads to
increased arterial myocyte ANO1 expression, ANO1 currents and vasoconstriction. The goal of
this proposal is to identify key proteins and signaling mechanisms mediating Ano1 expression in
resistance arteries and test the therapeutic potential of novel compounds in alleviating diabetes-
induced vasoconstriction."
10739309,"OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Near-roadway and regional air pollution, industrial releases, goods movement and growing oil and gas
production in urban areas vulnerable to wildfires all threaten to increase the burden of environmental disease. In
California and worldwide, these threats disproportionately affect children, especially in marginalized communities
and communities of color. Air pollution has adverse effects on childhood respiratory health, obesity and metabolic
outcomes, and neurodevelopment. New children’s environmental health science (CEHS) translation is needed
to develop and implement effective, science-based interventions to address these unfavorable trends. The
mission of the Southern California Center for Children’s Environmental Health Translational Research (SC-
CCEHTR) is to leverage scientific knowledge to reduce the burden of environmentally related diseases by
developing: (1) multidisciplinary CEHS translational teams building an innovative framework for multidirectional,
action-oriented engagement with communities, academia and policymakers, and (2) model collaborations
supporting junior investigators and communities to use emerging CEHS, leading to better decision-making.
Accordingly, the theme of the SC-CCEHTR is Urbanism, Air Pollution, Children’s Health and Environmental
Justice. The SC-CCEHTR will build on a foundation of a large CEHS grant base across three NIEHS Centers
and of innovative multidirectional engagement with communities and decision-makers. The proposed SC-
CCEHTR framework includes novel approaches to youth engagement and community science, urban design
and policy solutions, and communication and public knowledge. Investigators new to CEHS from communication,
policy and urban design, sociology, dramatic arts, education, network analysis and implementation science will
bring fresh approaches to this framework, focused on identifying solutions to urban air pollution by “re-imagining”
the design of the city to reduce air pollution exposure and improve children’s health. A Translation Core will bring
the SC-CCEHTR tools to bear on the development of pilot projects to better translate CEHS into community
knowledge and action. A Developmental Core responds to career development needs of junior investigators and
to emerging CEHS challenges. Innovative translational and career development collaborations will be promoted
with the Moving Forward Network of environmental justice communities, the International Society for Children’s
Health and the Environment, other Children's Environmental Health Research Translation Centers and NIEHS
P30 Core Centers, and policymakers across the country."

10913595,"SUMMARY: Gastrointestinal tract cancers (GI cancers) account for >70,000 deaths per year. Among GI cancers,
colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the US. Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is
another GI cancer of large concern to US public health and has risen alarmingly with a poor prognosis (20% 5-
year survival). There is an unmet need for effective cancer prevention and early detection of CRC and EAC.
 CRC & EAC arise from precancer lesions: CRC arises from adenomas and EAC from Barrett’s esophagus
(BE), which progress to high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and then cancer. This normal precancer
lesioncarcinoma sequence of GI tract epithelial cells has been the established paradigm of the cancer initiation
and progression process in the GI tract. The polyp-to-cancer paradigm suggests that progression is driven solely
by the accumulation of gene mutations and epigenetic alterations in cancer initiating cells. However, emerging
evidence suggests that these molecular alterations are insufficient to drive cancer formation and that multiple
tumor promoting mechanisms come from surrounding tissue. For example, our previous studies have shown
that increased senescent fibroblasts present in the normal colon of advanced adenoma patients can create a
pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. Further, molecular changes in the normal colon of patients with advanced
lesions may predispose tissue to tumor formation and mediate the carcinogenesis process, such as presence of
aberrant DNA methylation pattern, high gene mutation loads and microinflammation. Based on our previous
studies, we hypothesize that cancer initiation and progression require both cell-autonomous (e.g., cancer driver
gene mutations) and non-autonomous mechanisms from the tissue microenvironment. Discovery of the factors
mediating adenoma initiation & progression, and the translation of these findings into novel risk biomarkers or
prevention therapy would have a major impact on clinical prevention and management of GI cancers.
 To overcome technical barriers in prior studies and ensure scientific rigor and reproducibility, the Research
Specialist, Dr. Ming Yu, has developed a research plan to achieve the following objectives within the next five
years: Objective 1: Determine the role of senescent fibroblasts to promote the survival and clonal expansion of
colon cancer initiating cells in ex-vivo & in-vivo model system; Objective 2: Create a precancer atlas of molecular
alterations potentially associated with driving adenoma progression in primary clinical samples; Objective
3: Identify and evaluate DNA methylation-based tissue biomarkers as CRC risk markers and BE progression
markers. This research plan is an integral part of the NCI-funded research programs led by Unit Director, Dr.
William Grady, including the Early Detection Research Network Biomarker Characterization Center and the
Translational & Basic Science of Early Lesion Center. Successful completion of this research plan will provide
critical support to these research programs and lead to novel insight on the molecular carcinogenesis of GI
cancer. Findings will provide a new direction for discovering biomarkers to improve GI cancer management."
10890854,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The economic toll of substance use/abuse is estimated to be over $740 billion annually as a result of
accidents, health care, homelessness, unemployment, and criminal activity. Adolescence is a critical time for
intervention, as 90% of adults who meet the criteria for addiction initiate use of alcohol or drugs in
adolescence. Yet, prevention efforts have been hindered by minimal substance use screening by primary care
providers as well as low rates of disclosure by adolescents in medical settings. These challenges necessitate
new approaches to detect key risk factors and enhance screening methods. Importantly, adolescents with
experiences of child maltreatment are more susceptible to early substance use and more likely to progress
from experimentation to addiction than non-maltreated youth. The accumulating evidence and our preliminary
data suggest that the top predictors of early substance use are not relevant for child welfare (CW) youth,
requiring new studies of the relevant risk factors for this vulnerable population. The proposed study addresses
these gaps by using cutting-edge Machine Learning models to provide vital new evidence regarding risk
factors specific to the CW population as well as risks for early substance use that may be common to both CW
and non-CW youth. We will use two unique data sources to accomplish this. Our primary data will come from
electronic health records (EHR) of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) members (estimated
sample size of 3.4 million children, 2007-2020). We will use diagnosis codes for maltreatment to indicate the
CW sample, a reasonable assumption of referral to child welfare. Risk factors will be obtained from diagnosis
codes and abstractable progress notes in the EHR of children and parents as well as county crime and
geographic income data. Second, to address the limitations of EHR to capture more detailed psychosocial
data, we will use an existing longitudinal dataset of 454 youth, 303 referred from child welfare and 151 in a
comparison group (YAP study). Participants were seen at mean ages 11, 13, 15, and 18 years old and are
racially/ethnically diverse. Collected data includes measures of child level, parent level, family level, and
neighborhood risk factors and CW case records. These two data sources will allow us to: 1) produce critical
new knowledge regarding the relevant predictors of early substance use for CW versus non-CW youth and 2)
use intensive survey data (YAP) to determine risk factors that are not currently collected in EHR data (KPSC)
that may inform the development of new screening questions. Lastly, our predictive model has translational
potential to advance screening methods for adolescent substance use risk in pediatric primary care through the
use of risk scores integrated into clinical decision support tools. These findings, if implemented in clinical care
settings, would allow medical providers to more accurately identify those at risk and trigger stratification into
different treatment pathways to prevent substance abuse."
10889272,"Elimination of Plasmodium vivax (Pv) malaria parasites would greatly benefit from a blood-stage vaccine. PvDBP
is a parasite ligand involved in erythrocyte invasion through the interaction with its human receptor, the Duffy
protein. This interaction is critical for the parasite’s entry making PvDBP the most advanced candidate for a
blood-stage vaccine with Phase II clinical trials undergoing. Recent work has identified and characterized human
monoclonal antibodies (humabs) that allow strain-transcending neutralization of parasites regardless of their
PvDBP sequence diversity. However, we have demonstrated that Pv collected in Cambodia with multiple copies
of the PvDBP gene were able to overcome in vitro neutralization by these humabs. These observations provided
the first evidence for an evolutionary advantage for pvdbp amplification, widespread in Pv populations, and
created a new paradigm in which to consider pathogen immune evasion mechanisms. These results raise the
concern that implementation of a PvDBP vaccine may select for multi-pvdbp copy parasites. The overall goal
of this proposal is precisely to determine if pvdbp amplification will likely compromise a PvDBP vaccine
strategy. The first Specific Aim (SA) is to determine to what extent multi-pvdbp copy parasites genetically distant
from Cambodian isolates respond to anti-PvDBP humabs and to evaluate if pvdbp amplification is associated to
Duffy polymorphisms in human populations. By evaluating the in vitro neutralization by anti-PvDBP humabs of
single and multi-pvdbp copy parasites from Ethiopia, we will be able to evaluate the extent of the immune evasion
phenotype conferred by pvdbp amplification described with Cambodian Pv. By (i) associating in vitro invasion
rates with the full-length Duffy sequences of invaded erythrocytes, and (ii) prospectively testing for association
between pvdbp copy number and human Duffy sequences in participants enrolled in longitudinal cohorts in
Cambodia and in Ethiopia, we will be able to determine the relation between pvdbp amplification and Duffy
human polymorphism. Our second SA will be to evaluate the within-hosts and within-population dynamics of
pvdbp amplification over time. Through the analysis of the serological dynamics of our longitudinal cohorts’
participants, the measure of Pv infections and the pvdbp copy number of infecting parasites, we will be able to
test if the gene amplification is selected in vivo by the immune status of human hosts and how it correlates with
changes in Pv prevalence in the population. In vitro experimental evolution of Pk lines will provide complementary
evidence for selection of pvdbp amplification by anti-PvDBP humabs. Our third SA will be to decipher the
molecular mechanisms enabling multi-copy parasites to evade anti-PvDBP humabs’ neutralization. We will
specifically test if immune evasion results from increased protein quantity produced by multi-copy parasites
and/or from epitope variations through multiple, different alleles and variants present simultaneously in a given
parasite. Through a combination of phenotyping and genomic approaches, our results will provide invaluable
data to inform on strategies to overcome this immune evasion in the context of vaccine development.

11165452,"ABSTRACT
 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S., with ~236,700 new cases and ~130,200
deaths estimated for 2022. A joint effort by both PIs in this grant led to the identification of the oncogenic kinase
protein kinase C epsilon (PKCe) as a key player in lung carcinogenesis. PKCe is aberrantly up-regulated in lung
adenocarcinoma and is associated with poor outcome in patients specifically harboring KRAS mutations. Using
genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models, we demonstrated that PKCe is required for both carcinogen- and
Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis. In addition to this role in cancer initiation, our work established novel roles for
PKCe in cellular events associated with late cancer stages. Indeed PKCe is a major player in lung cancer cell
motility and invasion via activation of the small G-protein Rac1, linking this kinase to metastatic dissemination. That
PKCe plays critical permissive roles first during adenoma initiation and then again later during the acquisition of
metastatic competency highlights the functional complexities of the PKCe signaling events in lung cancer.
Interestingly, CRISPR-mediated inactivation of PKCe in the initiating cell-of-origin does not significantly affect Kras-
G12D-induced tumor development, leading us to hypothesize that PKCe does not strictly act in a tumor cell
autonomous manner to permit oncogenic KRAS-mediated tumorigenesis. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will
generate and characterize a series of GEM models to restrict genetic deletion of PKCe to either oncogenic Kras-
expressing cancer cells or to diverse stromal cell types present in the tumor microenvironment, including non-
cancerous epithelial, mesenchyme and hematopoietic cells. Gene expression studies on isolated cells using
fluorescence-based lineage tracing techniques will provide significant mechanistic insights. In Aim 2, we will
thoroughly dissect the mechanistic basis of motility/invasive signaling activation by PKCe. Our hypothesis is that
PKCe activates Rac1-mediated formation of cell ruffles and motility in KRAS mutant lung cancer cells via Rac
Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (Rac-GEFs). We will identify and characterize candidate Rac-GEFs as
PKCe effectors responsible for this phenotype. In Aim 3, we will establish the involvement of PKCe and its effector
Rac-GEFs for the development of metastatic lung cancer. We will use combined in vitro and in vivo approaches to
pin down mechanistic defects in the metastatic cascade upon CRISPR-mediated deletion of PKCe and Rac-GEFs
in lung adenocarcinoma cells. We will establish GEM models and use lentiviral CRISPR-based approaches to
determine the permissive contribution of PKCe and its GEF effectors to lung adenocarcinoma metastasis, and
identify relevant gene expression and signaling signatures contributing to this phenotype. Thus, by using
innovative, state-of-the-art genetic and molecular approaches, our studies should reveal the vast multidimensional
complexity of PKCe signaling in lung cancer development as well as underscore unappreciated mechanisms of
carcinogen- and KRAS-mediated lung oncogenesis."
10915047,"Project Summary
Pathological substance use disorders are devastating psychiatric conditions that lead to patterns of increasing
and out of control substance use. These disorders account for significant morbidity and mortality amongst
patients and inflict untold costs on their families and loved ones as well as society at large. Of these disorders,
pathological use of cocaine and other psychostimulants accounts for a significant proportion of morbidity and
mortality. Despite tremendous advances in understanding of the neurobiology of stimulant use disorders, there
are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for stimulant use disorders. In treating patients with stimulant use
disorder, the largest hurdle to overcome is in preventing drug relapse. In recent years there has been a
growing understanding that a number of systems outside of the brain can play a critical role in shaping brain
and behavior. Among these is the resident population of bacteria in the intestinal tract – collectively referred to
as the gut microbiome. Extensive research now demonstrates that changes in the gut microbiome play a
critical role in both normal brain function, as well as in the development of pathological states. In our own lab
we have previously published that acute depletion of the microbiome can alter the rewarding effects of cocaine
and affect gene expression changes in the brain. More recently, we have begun investigating how depleting
the microbiome with antibiotics affects the persistence of behavioral and brain gene expression changes in
animal models of relapse. We find that animals that lack a complex microbiome have increased cocaine
seeking behaviors after a prolonged period of abstinence. Genome-wide RNA-sequencing analyses
demonstrate that these animals have robust changes in gene expression in important striatal gene networks
that affect synaptic plasticity and behavior. Additional analyses demonstrate epigenetic changes in chromatin
structure. Importantly, behavioral and molecular effects of microbiome depletion can be largely reversed by
replenishment of specific bacterially derived small molecules. In this grant we will work in two comprehensive
Aims to clarify the specificity and mechanisms of these effects and will work to further targeting the gut
microbiome and its molecular byproducts. Aim 1 will define temporal specificity of microbiome depletion effects
on drug seeking behaviors with targeted microbiome depletions and reconstitutions at different phases of
behavior. Behavioral studies will be coupled with molecular analyses of synaptic plasticity related
transcriptional and epigenetic effects. Additional analyses of microbiome composition will define bacterial
populations associated with increased drug seeking. Aim 2 will further clarify the role of individual microbiome-
derived small molecules in driving these behavioral and molecular changes. These studies will provide critical
mechanistic insight into gut-brain signaling in a model of cocaine use disorder and will lay the foundation for
tractable translational research going forward."
10901980,"Here we seek to improve the accuracy of hemodynamic modeling of cerebral aneurysms. This goal of this
project is to predict the outcome of cerebral aneurysm treatment. This is significant due to the prevalence of
cerebral aneurysms, their dismal prognosis when ruptured, and treatment failure rates (resulting in aneurysm
recurrence and risk of either brain hemorrhage or need for retreatment) of up to 40%. Hemodynamic forces are
thought to influence aneurysm treatment outcomes, and can be simulated using computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) methods, but such studies have not been widely accepted due to conflicting results. Traditional CFD
analysis (termed “Eulerian” metrics) only studies the effect of blood flow on the vascular walls, largely ignoring
circulating blood products such as platelets that initiate intra-aneurysmal thrombosis (termed “Lagrangian”
metrics), which have a critical role in treatment outcome. Better prediction through a holistic approach
combining both types of analyses could identify patients at risk for treatment failure, influencing pre-surgical
decision-making.
 This project builds on our ongoing NIH-funded expertise (via a renewal of R01NS105692) in the CFD
modeling of cerebral aneurysms before and after treatment. We have developed an innovative method of
incorporating novel Lagrangian metrics, such as residence time and shear history, into CFD simulations in with
existing Eulerian hemodynamic metrics, to create a holistic approach to modeling the effects of aneurysm
treatment. Feasibility studies have characterized the post-treatment hemodynamic environment with special
attention to platelet-representative particles that experience prolonged intra-aneurysmal residence time and
low cumulative shear history within treated aneurysms. Previous in vitro studies of platelets in similar
conditions demonstrate thrombosis in such environments, which would be advantageous after aneurysm
treatment to develop a stable thrombus leading to aneurysm healing.
 First, we will perform CFD simulations before and after treatment on a cohort of cerebral aneurysms
whose treatment outcome (success or failure) is known. We will include both Eulerian and Lagrangian metrics
to determine associations with treatment outcome. Second, we will use an established animal model of
cerebral aneurysms, treated with commercially-available endovascular devices. We will perform CFD
simulations a similar holistic model as the human aneurysm cohort, and investigate the relationship between
Lagrangian metrics and treatment-related thrombosis on histological analysis. The final result will be an
optimized CFD methodology and set of Eulerian and Lagrangian variables predictive of outcome after cerebral
aneurysm embolization."

during development, during which it breaks anterior-posterior (A-P) symmetry, forms a tailbud posteriorly, and
elongates along the A-P axis. The progenitors in the tail bud proliferate to drive this extension and further
differentiate to give rise to neural and mesodermal cell types. This proposal aims to understand how axial
elongation is driven and how the progenitor cells in the tailbud maintain a self-sustaining pool, even as they
differentiate into neural and mesodermal cells. Since the mechanisms underlying human axial elongation and
patterning are not shared between other vertebrates, the generalizability of results from model organisms to
humans remains unknown. While ethical reasons necessitate the use of in vitro models of human
development, the large variability in such organoid systems has been a critical barrier.
Preliminary work overcame this barrier to strikingly and reproducibly model human axial morphogenesis and
patterning by developing an organoid system that elongates to generate the posterior neural tube and flanking
paraxial mesoderm. Using this powerful system, the proposal seeks to answer two fundamental questions
associated with this process: first, how morphogen signals break A-P symmetry and stably drive self-sustaining
axial extension along a single axis. The goal is to uncover the underlying dynamical system that is activated to
drive self-sustaining axial elongation and to understand how this system buffers against noise so as not to be
susceptible to dynamical instabilities, for example, leading to branched or multiple axes. The second is to
determine the dynamical system governing the maintenance of a proliferating pool of progenitors in the tailbud
throughout axial elongation, even as they are driven to differentiate into neural and mesodermal tissues. The
proposal brings together methods to infer and measure spatiotemporal profiles of gene expression; compare
these profiles with other model organisms to determine similarities and differences in gene expression patterns
driving axial elongation, and Bayesian ensemble modeling to build predictive models of the GRN driving axial
elongation and experimental tools to test model predictions. The proposal will allow us to achieve a quantitative
understanding of the dynamics across scales, from intracellular signaling and transcriptional regulation to
cellular rearrangement to tissue-level axial extension made possible by new human stem cell lines, imaging,
image processing, statistical inference, mathematical modeling, and bioengineering tools, to provide insights
into principles governing human axial elongation. The ability to build and test quantitative predictive models of
human axial extension will open novel avenues to understanding the mechanisms underlying human diseases."

 Non-traumatic lower extremity amputations (NLEA) in people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy
(DPN) have devastating consequences, most notable a 3-year mortality rate of up to 71%. Data from our
previous award cycle support a foot bone and vascular pathway culminating in NLEA in people with DPN.
Bone and vascular deterioration were significantly related to key risk factors for NLEA in the insensate foot;
foot deformity, fracture, and delayed wound healing. However, the current bone and vascular pathway does
not explain why the highest rate of NLEA occurs in individuals with DPN and end-stage chronic kidney disease
(CKD). We believe that CKD-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is the missing link in the foot bone and
vascular pathway to DPN-associated NLEA. CKD-MBD is recognized, in the hip and coronary/aortic vessels, to
induce a bone-vascular paradox with loss of skeletal bone volume and strength and vascular calcification.
However, the contribution of CKD-MBD to DPN-associated NLEA is unknown. Thus, this renewal application
will extend our discoveries and test the central hypothesis that CKD-MBD synergistically combines with DPN in
the foot bone and vascular deterioration pathway to place the DPN foot at the highest risk for NLEA.
 This application will employ a multi-site, cross-sectional (n=216) and longitudinal (n=114), study of
people with Type 2 DPN across all stages of CKD: stage 1(No CKD) to 5. Through this project we aim to: 1)
quantify the effect of CKD severity and progression on pedal bone quality & quantity and vessel calcification
(Aim 1), 2) determine the effect of CKD, mediated through bone quantity and quality and foot vessel
calcification, on clinically relevant foot outcomes (Aim 2), 3) explore the ability of CKD, bone quality and
quantity, and vascular calcification variables to predict risk for clinically relevant poor foot outcomes.
 The investigative team from Washington University in St. Louis, High Point University, and University of
California San Francisco represents a unique and powerful combination of collective and individual clinical
research expertise in DPN tissue deterioration, imaging, and CKD-MBD. This project uses highly innovative
cutting-edge technology and processing to measure individual foot bone quantity & quality and pedal vessel
calcification with computed tomography and hidden changes in foot bone cortical and trabecular micro-
architecture that are not reflected in global measures of BMD using high resolution peripheral quantitative
computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Finally, in our NLEA risk prediction aim we include a CKD-MBD serum
marker (sclerostin), a critical step in translating CKD-MBD research from bench to bedside. Understanding the
pathway to NLEA will improve preventative care and management of people with DPN to reduce the risk of
NLEA by making CKD prevention and treatment indispensable, identifying pharmaceutical targets, and
identifying risk factors of NLEA, allowing early intervention."

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent condition worldwide, especially in people with obesity, and is an
independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD).
Current available OSA treatments have not consistently detected the anticipated improvements in CVD and
CMD, suggesting the need for adjuvant therapies aimed at the mechanisms underlying the core disturbances
induced by OSA. As such, OSA-induced renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation may trigger
excessive mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling, which play a major role in endothelial dysfunction and
atherosclerosis. Thus, the hypothesis is that OSA-induced CMD is mediated, at least in part, by MR dependent
mechanisms. To examine the role of MR in OSA-induced CMD, obese C57Bl/6 male and female mice will be
exposed to intermittent hypoxia (IH) during the rest period, a mouse model of OSA, for 6 weeks (short-term) and
16 weeks (long-term) and treated with the conventional steroidal MR antagonist (spironolactone) or the novel
non-steroidal MR antagonist (finerenone) to evaluate the MR-dependent reversibility of IH-induced CMD (SA1).
To investigate whether MR inhibition can accelerate CMD recovery, mice will be exposed to short-and long-term
IH followed by 12 weeks of normoxia (IH cessation – simulating ideal OSA treatment) with or without concurrent
treatment with MR antagonists (SA2). To examine the role of vascular cell-specific MR, transgenic mice with
endothelial cell (EC)-specific and smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific deletions of MR will be exposed to long-
term IH (SA3). Coronary artery function will be evaluated in vivo and ex vivo in addition to heart function, blood
pressure and metabolic assessments. Moreover, immunohistological analysis of the coronary vessels, along
with gene networks expression dynamics among different coronary artery cell populations will be evaluated using
single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). Male and female mice will be fed a high-fat or control diet for 8
weeks then housed in environmental chambers for IH exposures (alternating 6.1% FIO2/21.0%FIO2 90 sec:90
sec, for 6 or 16 weeks during 12 daylight hours, and treated with spironolactone (20mg/kg), finerenone (1mg/kg),
or placebo. IH cessation protocol consists of removing the exposed animals for the IH chambers and left under
normoxic conditions for 12 weeks. Heart function will be examined via echocardiography, while blood pressure
and coronary flow reserve velocity (CFVR) will be assessed using tail cuff method/telemetry and doppler flow
velocity system, respectively. Additionally, Insulin tolerance test and fasting blood and lipid profiles will be
evaluated. After euthanasia, coronary arteries will be excised and mounted on a wire myograph for functional
studies or processed for immunohistological analyses (including intima-media thickness, collagen fiber
distribution, and indices of oxidative stress and inflammation) or snRNA-seq. The proposed studies will elucidate
the role of MR signaling in OSA-mediated coronary artery dysfunction and potential approaches to enhance
CMD reversibility, thereby enabling MR antagonists as biologically plausible therapeutic targets in OSA patients."

This proposal focuses on defining the molecular mechanisms of axon navigation and connectivity. A normal
functioning human nervous system requires the interconnection of billions of neurons. Improper formation or
maintenance of these connections leads to abnormalities that result in mental diseases and disorders. How are
these connections assembled and integrated? Research has revealed that the molecular mechanisms of axon
guidance and connectivity are well-conserved between simple and complex animals. Simple animals like flies
use many of the same guidance signals as mammals. Therefore, as a step towards understanding how
complex nervous systems form and properly function, we have pursued a strategy to determine how the simple
model fly nervous system is assembled – where we can also apply high-resolution molecular, genetic,
biochemical, cellular, and imaging approaches to solve this problem. Indeed, the goal of my research program
is to focus on a group of axons within the simple nervous system of the fly embryo and characterize the
molecules and mechanisms that guide them to their targets. In particular, elegant studies from multiple labs
have now identified numerous extracellular cues and receptors that guide axons, revealing fundamental
mechanisms of how axons form connections. Far less is known, however, of the intracellular signaling
pathways and mechanisms that link these guidance cues and their receptors to the control of axon navigation.
Likewise, these guidance cues work to either attract or repel axons. Yet, how navigating axons choose
between these antagonistic signals when they simultaneously encounter them remains far from clear. To
answer these questions, we have focused on one of the largest protein families involved in connectivity, the
Semaphorins (Semas) and their Plexin cell-surface receptors. Employing these strategies, our work has
uncovered critical new molecules and mechanisms directing guidance/connectivity. Namely, we have
discovered MICAL family enzymes, and have found that MICAL and SelR enzymes employ a specific
reversible biochemical mechanism to control guidance/connectivity. We have also discovered that precise
connectivity occurs via direct links between Semas/Plexins and other guidance molecules including Integrin-
mediated adhesive receptors, specific growth factors, cyclic nucleotides, adaptors, small GTPases, serine-
threonine and tyrosine kinases, and cytoskeletal assemblers and disassemblers. Now, using these strategies,
our preliminary results uncover that these specific molecular pathways that provide connectivity to neurons are
spatiotemporally and directly instructed by specific molecular pathways that provide metabolic sustenance to
neurons. We therefore hypothesize that specific factors that govern neuronal connectivity are directly, locally,
selectively, and instructively controlled by specific factors that govern neuronal metabolism. We propose to test
this biomedically significant and innovative hypothesis by employing rigorous molecular, genetic, biochemical,
cellular, and imaging approaches and the robust Drosophila high-resolution model system."

The broad and long-term goal of this research project is to test the hypothesis that (1) the response of apamin-
sensitive small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) current (IKAS) to sympathetic stimulation plays an important
role in the mechanisms of sex differences in cardiac arrhythmogenesis and that (2) beta-3 adrenoceptor (AR)
activation is antiarrhythmic and eliminates the sex difference of IKAS activation during sympathetic stimulation.
In the current funding period, we discovered a significant sex difference of both the SK protein and IKAS at
baseline and that the magnitudes of sex differences are amplified during isoproterenol or acetylcholine
infusion. Apamin reduces the phase singularities (PSs) in ventricular fibrillation (VF) more effectively in the
female than in the male ventricles. It is unclear which AR is responsible for the isoproterenol-induced IKAS
activation. Isoproterenol activates the beta-1 and beta-2 ARs at lower concentrations than the beta-3 AR.
Contrary to the effects of beta-1 and beta-2 AR activation, beta-3 AR activation exerts negative inotropic
effects in the myocardium. Beta-3 ARs likely served as a buffer or rescuer of the excess catecholamines. We
showed in a canine model of ventricular tachycardia that BRL-37344 (a beta-3 agonist) is antiarrhythmic. We
hypothesize that beta-3 AR activation is antiarrhythmic and eliminates the sex difference of IKAS activation
during sympathetic stimulation in the rabbit model. Specific Aim 1: SK current, beta-3 adrenoceptor activation,
and Sex Differences in Ventricular Arrhythmogenesis. We will perform optical mapping and patch clamp
studies with specific beta-1 and beta-2 antagonists in the presence of isoproterenol. We also will perform
optical mapping studies to determine the effects of mirabegron on phase singularities (PSs) during VF with and
without isoproterenol. In additional experiments, we will use BRL-37344 instead of mirabegron to test the
hypothesis that this antiarrhythmic mechanism is a class effect shared by other beta-3 agonists. The
antiarrhythmic action of mirabegron will then be tested in a rabbit model of myocardial infarction. These
findings will be used to test the hypothesis that beta-3 AR activation rescues the proarrhythmic effects of beta-
1 and beta-2 stimulation, indirectly reduce IKAS, and eliminates the sex differences of PSs in VF. Specific Aim 2:
Na+-K+ ATPase (NKA) activation during beta3 stimulation contributes to the sex differences of antiarrhythmic
action. Beta-3 AR activates NKA, which may reduce Ca2+ overload-induced cardiac arrhythmias. We
hypothesize that NKA activation plays a vital role in the antiarrhythmic effects of beta-3 AR activation. We will
first perform studies to determine if there is a sex difference in beta-3 AR, NKA protein, and mRNA in rabbit
ventricles. Optical mapping studies will be done in the presence of ouabain, a specific NKA blocker, to
determine if the company of NKA is required for the antiarrhythmic effects of beta-3 activation. Rabbit
ventricular action potential models will be used for computer simulation studies to assess the importance of
NKA activation in the antiarrhythmic mechanisms of beta-3 AR activation."

 Populations in Mexico and Latin America experience substantial cancer-related health
inequities compared to those in high-income countries. Poor implementation of evidence-based cancer
control interventions (EBIs) is, in part, to blame. We propose to establish a new Center: Leveraging
Implementation Science To Optimize Strategies (LISTOS) for Cancer Control to advance
global implementation science (IS) in cancer control in Mexico and Latin America. Through two
research studies that address critical cancer control needs, and two cores (Administrative, and Research
Capacity Building), the LISTOS Center will: 1) build organizational readiness for implementation of
cancer control EBIs in Mexico; and 2) build readiness for implementation research through capacity
building, training, and mentorship. The LISTOS Center has two content-related subthemes
corresponding to the two primary ways that cancer control EBIs can be “optimized”: 1) adapting EBIs
and implementation strategies to improve fit with the diverse populations and settings in Mexico; and
2) developing implementation strategies to improve and accelerate EBI adoption, integration, scale-up,
and sustainment in Mexico. These subthemes are integrated across the research projects and cores.
 The Administrative and Engagement Core will provide leadership; offer administrative
support, coordination, communication, and engagement activities; and lead dissemination efforts.
Leveraging substantial IS training experience, existing programs, and a strong and diverse team of
investigators, mentors, and partners, the Research Capacity Building Core will support a range of
activities to train the next generation of IS leaders throughout Latin America. The LISTOS center cores
will support two innovative research studies that will increase the reach, effectiveness, and
sustainment of cancer early detection in health care systems that serve disadvantaged populations in
Mexico, using innovative and scalable implementation strategies. These studies aim to: 1) increase the
adoption, implementation, and sustainment of CRCS EBIs in a public insurance healthcare system; and
2) integrate breast cancer rapid diagnosis pathways across health services available for the uninsured.
The Center utilizes innovative and tailored approaches that will enable a new generation of LMIC-based
researchers to conduct research that will accelerate and improve the use of effective and scalable cancer
control EBIs. The aims will both advance the science of implementation in LMICs (measurement,
adaptation, and strategy development) and create a sustainable infrastructure that will enable
continued contributions to the field for years to come."

Pacific Islanders represent one of the fastest growing racial/ethnic groups in the United States.
Pacific Islanders suffer from disparities in a variety of health problems such as obesity,
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer at several sites. Although physical activity is an
effective way to reduce the risks of these health problems, Pacific Islander adults are generally
less physically activity than non-Hispanic whites. The search for effective policies and
interventions to promote PA among Pacific Islanders is severely hampered by the paucity of
research on the mechanisms underlying PA behavioral change in this population. This
longitudinal study will examine the influence of contextual and environmental factors and acute
momentary precipitants on PA adoption and maintenance among 150 sedentary Pacific Islander
adults. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the
social/environmental determinants of health, social cognitive theories of behavioral change, and
prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based, state of the
art methodologies consisting of MotionSense, ecological momentary assessment, and GPS.
MotionSense track behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect PA
behaviors and negative affect/stress of participants. GPS permits real-time mapping of an
individual’s space-time trajectories and relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g.,
proximity to PA facilities; neighborhood safety) using geographic information system data.
Principal outcomes of interest are PA adoption and PA maintenance. This research would be
the first to systematically study PA behaviors of Pacific Islander adults and the first to combine
objective and dynamic indices of PA, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in
PA behavior studies. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the
field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-reports and static
residential locations for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one of the first studies
to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach, to fully
examine the huge amount of data yielded by real time assessment approaches. The results will
provide critical evidence to guide policies and interventions targeted at reducing PA-related
health disparities experienced by Pacific Islanders and potentially other racial/ethnic minorities."

There is a fundamental gap in understanding the extent to which the school environment contributes to
respiratory virus exposure, and less is known about effective environmental interventions to reduce exposure.
Our long-term goal is to create healthy indoor school environments for children. The overall objective of this
application is to identify environmental predictors of and potential interventions influencing respiratory virus
exposure in elementary schools. We will extend the robust infrastructure of the School Inner-City Asthma
Intervention Study (SICAS-2, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02291302), a five-year randomized controlled trial
conducted by our group of a placebo-controlled classroom high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaner
intervention to continue cohort recruitment in the post-COVID-19 pandemic period. We will test our central
hypothesis that modifiable built environment factors influence airborne respiratory virus exposure and infection
in elementary schools through the following specific aims: (1) To determine the efficacy of a randomized
placebo controlled HEPA cleaner intervention in reducing classroom airborne respiratory virus exposure; (2) To
determine the efficacy of a randomized placebo controlled HEPA cleaner intervention in reducing symptomatic
and asymptomatic respiratory viral infections in asthmatic children. The approach is innovative, because we
are simultaneously interrogating all major human respiratory viruses in the context of a school-based
randomized trial focused on an environmental intervention. The proposed research is significant, because if the
HEPA intervention can reduce respiratory virus exposure and infections in schools, it is an immediately
actionable and practical intervention to create safer indoor environments for elementary school children.
Results from this proposal may be generalizable to other public indoor settings."
10917360,"Abstract: We will develop a training program to shape the thinking, impart skills and tools for rigor and
reproducibility in biomedical data science, and ensure the application of such skills and tools in a wide range of
biomedical research through a learning phase (bootcamp with collaborative learning) and an implementation
phase (mentoring). In addition, we will enable our trainees to teach their newly acquired skills at their
institutions. Our short-term goal is to shape the thinking of biomedical researchers from diverse backgrounds
and equip them with skills and tools to improve the rigor and reproducibility of their research. Our long-term
goal is to have a long-lasting impact on rigor and reproducibility through the transfer of skills from our trainees
to their trainees, improve research outcomes and its benefits to the society, and to strengthen a diverse
biomedical data science workforce.
Research projects with long data manipulation pipelines face rigor and reproducibility challenges throughout
their lifecycle. Despite the efforts of the research community to promote rigor and reproducibility, there lacks
systematic training for researchers to build the technical know-how to achieve this in practice. Our program
will focus on six topics: 1) Ethical issues in biomedical data science. 2) Data management, representation, data
sharing with confidentiality considerations, and metadata. 3) Rigorous statistical design. 4) Design and
reporting of predictive modeling. 5) Reproducible workflow. 6) Meta-analysis.
Our program will support diversity at four levels. Scientifically, we train researchers who use diverse types of
data (from -omics data all the way to population data) to address research questions at various scales.
Professionally, we will train faculty and technical personnel at any career stage. Demographically, we will
ensure that researchers from underrepresented groups have a strong presence in our program, through intense
recruitment effort and by building a friendly learning environment. Institutionally, we will train researchers
from major research universities as well as from institutions with limited resources, and we will especially
welcome researchers from Minority-Serving Institutions.
Our training program will focus on teams of faculty (project PIs) and technical personnel. They both play
critical roles to ensure rigor and reproducibility, but may approach this from different perspectives. Training
them together will allow them to benefit from each other’s scientific expertise and technical skills and address
rigor and reproducibility in a collaborative manner. We will use a combination of training components
(lectures, small group intensive sessions and team projects) through an online adaptive learning tool to
effectively accommodate the highly variable scientific and technical backgrounds of our teams of trainees."
10874673,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anxiety symptoms are one of the most prevalent and earliest forms of psychopathology in childhood and have
been linked with lasting effects on socioemotional wellbeing, reduce life satisfaction, and increase chance of
more severe psychopathology developing into adolescence and adulthood. Latinx children and adolescents
experience alarmingly high rates of anxiety and related internalizing disorders compared to other ethnic
groups, with some studies finding rates as high as 40%. Yet, we know little about risk and protective factors for
the emergence of symptoms in these children. Consistent with NIMH’s Strategic Objective 2 “to examine
mental illness trajectories across the lifespan” this K01 proposal will investigate early predictors of emerging
anxious behaviors, including neural biomarkers (Aim 1) and caregiver-child factors (Aim 2), while also
considering how broader cultural processes may influence risk trajectories for Latinx youth (Aim 3) from the
toddlerhood to preschool period. Knowledge from the proposed project could have a substantial impact on our
ability to identify which Latinx children are most likely to start trajectories towards anxiety early in life and could
help generate culturally-tailored interventions to modify developmental trajectories away from increased
symptoms in these children. This proposal leverages the opportunity to add measures to an ongoing 5-year
longitudinal study with children from a primarily Latinx area of Central Texas. This K01 proposal will add an in-
lab visit with neural and caregiver-child observational measures. The proposal will use EEG-based resting-
state measures (i.e., alpha asymmetry, beta-delta coupling) to assess general emotional processing and
regulatory tendencies (Aim 1), and observational measures of caregiver-child interactions to assess caregiver-
child emotion socialization (Aim 2). Additionally, the proposed K01 project will leverage caregiver and child
anxiety symptom and cultural socialization data (Aim 3) already being collected as part of the larger study.
Through this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) the applicant will get needed training and
expertise on 1) EEG biomarkers in young children; 2) anxiety from a developmental psychopathology
perspective; 3) dyadic and longitudinal data analysis; and 4) cultural approaches. A rich training environment
with a multidisciplinary team of mentors and consultants in each of these areas has been assembled to meet
these goals. Findings from this study will offer the opportunity to map anxious trajectories as well as risk and
protective factors at a younger age than typically studied in Latinx youth development, and when dysregulation
patterns start to become noticeable but are still highly malleable. The proposed research and training plan will
enable the candidate to succeed in their long-term goal of launching a fully independent and unique research
program using multi-modal approaches to study biological and dyadic emotion-related processes, as well as
resilience mechanisms that may shape anxiety trajectories in young, particularly Latinx, children."
10723906,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Infections caused by the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus are serious and frequently
challenging to treat. While its propensity for developing antibiotic resistance has rendered treatment options
limited, this problem is exacerbated by phenotypic heterogeneity at infection sites that leads to highly stress-
tolerant subpopulations even with antibiotic-sensitive strains. Understanding this heterogeneity and its drivers
will aid in effective clearance of S. aureus infection, but capturing the diversity of heterogeneous bacterial
states in response to stimuli may additionally help us understand the complex regulatory events triggered,
deepening our understanding of the biology of this organism.
The central importance of transcriptional regulation in microbial responses to stimuli has made capture of the
global transcriptome by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) an invaluable tool. I previously applied RNA-seq to reveal
how genomic structural variations cause antimicrobial resistance in Leishmania parasites, and how different
species of Candida fungi adapt to the macrophage phagosome environment. However, capturing the
population-averaged transcriptome is of limited utility in understanding variation within populations. For
example, why do some bacteria survive an antibiotic treatment while others die? Why do some bacteria
proliferate in the host, whereas others remain in a silent, but highly antibiotic-tolerant, state? Single cell RNA-
seq (scRNA-seq) has radically expanded our ability to capture heterogeneous regulatory states. I recently
applied scRNA-seq to resolve, for the first time, the transcriptional dynamics of the bacterial cell cycle in S.
aureus and Escherichia coli, overcoming limitations of bulk methods caused by the difficulty of obtaining fully
synchronized, unperturbed populations. This yielded new clues about the changes within proliferating bacteria,
and a quantitative description of an important form of intrinsic heterogeneity in these organisms.
In this proposal, I move from intrinsic heterogeneity in steady-state populations to heterogeneity in responses
to environmental stimuli. In Aim 1, I will explore the relationship between heterogeneous transcriptional
responses to the antibiotic vancomycin and tolerance to this drug. In Aim 2, I consider the more complex
environmental challenge of intracellular survival within endothelial cells, where S. aureus may enter either a
proliferative, lytic state or a persistent one that is highly tolerant to antibiotics. In both cases, the central
premise of this work is that bacterial heterogeneity is not only of considerable medical importance, but through
innovative analysis strategies, we can use this heterogeneity to develop a more profound understanding of the
regulatory biology underlying this behavior. The impact will not only be to provide novel insights into how S.
aureus survives and thrives despite complex environmental challenges, but also to develop a conceptual and
analytical framework for applying scRNA-seq as a transformative tool for studying bacterial pathogens."
10764798,"Inflammation plays a major role in the progressive pathology of cystic fibrosis (CF), and is generally thought to
be a response to increased microbial colonization of CF lungs. However, recent studies involving normal and
CFTR-mutant ferrets raised under broad-spectrum antibiotics show robust inflammation in the CF lung despite
the absence of bacterial pathogens. Moreover, while the revolutionary class of CFTR modulators improve lung
function and reduce exacerbations, they are less successful in mitigating inflammation of the CF lung. These
findings raise the possibility that inflammation, and perhaps other pathogenic features of CF, are maintained by
elements that emerge in the disease but then drive progression independent of CFTR activity. An analogous
scenario may be operating in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where inflammation and disease
progression continues despite smoking cessation. In COPD, recent studies have shown a strong correlation
(p<10-16) between the emergence of pro-inflammatory, small airway epithelial cells and the disease itself.
These pathogenic variants are also present, albeit at low levels, in control patients without COPD and in fetal
lung. A similar analysis of CF lungs has revealed them to be inundated by pathogenic stem cell variants highly
related to those seen in COPD, along with two novel, hyperinflammatory variants not previously identified in
COPD lungs. We hypothesize that these CF stem cell variants play key roles in the progression of CF, and
represent pathogenic elements of this disease triggered by, and yet independent of, the CFTR genotype. To
test this hypothesis and extend our understanding of the potential significance of these variants in CF disease
processes, we will, in three specific aims, 1) identify key inflammatory drivers in the three, hyperinflammatory
human CF variants using CRISPR-Cas9-directed mutations and xenograft models, 2) test the dependence of
the pro-inflammatory phenotype of these three variants found in CF patients on CFTR activity using gene
complementation and CFTR-modulating drugs such as ivacaftor, elexacaftor, and tezacaftor, and 3) exploit our
recently developed methods for cloning ferret airway stem cells to determine the dynamics of the pathogenic
variants in a ferret conditional model of CF progression. We anticipate that these studies will provide context
and insight into the contributions of variant stem cells that dominate CF lungs, assess the impact of the new
CF therapeutics on the pathogenic features of these cells, as well as identify nodal genes in the inflammatory
signatures of these variants whose suppression could be of therapeutic benefit to these patients."
10726566,"The overall research program of the applicant has focused on the role of LOS and the innate immune
system and has shown that the degree of phosphorylation of the lipid A component is correlated with the
potential of the LOS to induce innate immune cytokine-mediated inflammation and, in general, with the severity
of Neisserial disease. Based on the results of these studies, recent work has undertaken the development of
potential therapeutics targeting gonococcal LOS as infections due to N. gonorrhoeae are a major cause of
morbidity with an estimated 850,000 cases in the U.S. and 87 million cases worldwide annually. Within the VA
Health Care System, cases of gonorrhea increased between 2013 and 2017 with the total number in that time
period at 10,587. Within the U.S. military, service members are a defined high-risk group for gonorrhea as
noted by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force as the high-risk environment of active military service is
thought to increase risky behavior and, thus, the rate of sexually transmitted infections including gonorrhea. A
total of 27,658 cases of gonorrhea were identified among active duty personnel during FY 2007 to 2015 (222.7
per 100,000 military compared with 179.3 per 100,000 non-military in 2018). There is no vaccine to N.
gonorrhoeae and a great need for new antibiotics due to the alarming rise in multidrug-resistance (MDR),
which is making emergence of untreatable gonococcal infections a real prospect. Thus, there is a compelling
need for new antimicrobials for gonococcal infections.
 To this end, the projects to be pursued during the proposed funding period of this SRCS award are as
follows: 1) LpxC inhibitors and cell-penetrating peptides; we recently reported that treatment of gonococci
with an inhibitor of LpxC, the enzyme that catalyzes the second step of lipid A biosynthesis, was bactericidal
for MDR and human challenge strains of gonococci and reduced cytokine induction without apparent human
cell cytotoxicity. Most recently, we evaluated the bactericidal potential of a 12 amino acid cell-penetrating
peptide (CPP) and found that it penetrated the bacterial membrane and was bactericidal for all multi-drug
resistant and human challenge strains of gonococci tested and reduced inflammatory cytokine induction and
prevented bacterial cell invasion of cervical epithelial cells. These novel data highlight LpxC inhibitors and
CPP as promising antimicrobials for N. gonorrhoeae and strongly support the hypothesis of this application that
inhibiting the biosynthesis of lipid A components with LpxC inhibitors and disrupting outer membrane integrity
with CPP will impact bacterial viability and host response to N. gonorrhoeae infection in vitro and in vivo, which
will have a therapeutic impact on infection outcomes. Translational studies of these two potential therapeutics
for gonorrhea will be the primary focus of the investigations proposed for the award period. 2) EptA
inhibitors; we will continue our collaboration with Drs. Charlene Kahler and Alice Vrielink of the University of
Western Australia in which we are targeting gonococcal EptA, the phosphoethanolamine transferase for lipid A,
with small molecule inhibitors to sensitize N. gonorrhoeae to killing by cationic antimicrobial peptides inside
neutrophils and reduce the induction of inflammatory cytokines. 3) Gonococcal survival in neutrophils; we
will continue our collaboration with Dr. Alison Criss of the University of Virginia to determine the impact of LOS
structural variation on the survival of gonococci in PMNs. 4) Gonococcal vaccine; in collaboration with Dr.
Peter Beernink of UCSF, we will develop native outer membrane vesicle vaccines from N. meningitidis strains
engineered to express potentially protective N. gonorrhoeae antigens.
 Overall, the research proposed for the next SRCS funding period will continue to support the mission of VA
Healthcare through studies that will facilitate the translational development of potential therapeutics and
vaccines targeting gonorrhea, which is classified by CDC as an urgent public health threat due to the rapid
increase in the number of MDR isolates."

Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) on hepatocytes. We have demonstrated that GDNF transgenic (GDNF-
Tg) mice fed a high fat diet are protected from obesity and the development of hepatic steatosis despite similar
food intake and physical activity. GDNF-Tg mice overexpress GDNF under the control of the GFAP promoter
expressed in glia and stellate cells. GDNF and its receptor GFRα−1 are expressed in human and murine
hepatocytes. Thus, GDNF present in the liver can act locally on the hepatocytes. We recently demonstrated
that GDNF can enhance autophagy and prevent liver injury. Our preliminary data demonstrate novel effects of
GDNF on the liver that include: (i) Human liver tissue from patients with steatosis and fibrosis have reduced
GDNF expression (ii) Western diet (WD)-fed mice have reduced level of Sirt3 and this is ameliorated in GDNF-
Tg mice fed a WD; (iii) Human hepatocytes treated with GDNF have increased mitophagy. (iv) GDNF prevents
apoptosis in primary human hepatocytes. The signaling pathway for these potentially beneficial effects of
GDNF have yet to be explored. We hypothesize that the mechanism of GDNF prevention of hepatic injury is
through promoting hepatocyte Sirt3 signaling, subsequent improved mitochondrial function leading to
increased hepatocyte survival. Using both genetic and pharmacological approaches we will define the role of
GDNF in inducing mitophagy to lead to improved mitochondrial function, fat reduction and reduced hepatic
injury. To test the hypothesis and further investigate the underlying mechanism(s) of GDNF regulation of
hepatic steatosis, we propose the following interrelated, but independently achievable aims: Specific Aim 1:
To determine the mechanism of GDNF regulation of Sirt3 Preliminary data indicate that GDNF is a potent
inducer of Sirt3 in vivo and in vitro. We have demonstrated that GDNF can activate the ERK signaling pathway
in hepatocytes through its receptor GFRα1. We will establish if the mechanism of GDNF regulation of Sirt3 is
through the GFRα1-ERK-CREB-PGC-1α pathway. WT and GDNF-Tg mice will be fed a Western diet together
with fructose and glucose added in drinking water (WD/FG) for 16 weeks and ERK-CREB-PGC-1α-Sirt3
pathway assessed in hepatocytes. In vitro the necessity and sufficiency of ERK-CREB-PGC-1α in the GDNF
regulation of Sirt3 expression will be determined using gene knock down and overexpression strategies.
Specific Aim 2: To examine the role of mitochondrial function and mitophagy in GDNF-mediated
hepatocyte survival. Our preliminary data demonstrate that GDNF increases mitochondrial function and
mitophagy in hepatocytes. We will establish the role of GDNF in regulating mitochondrial function and
mitophagy using the GDNF-Tg mice and in vitro experiments involving treatment of hepatocytes with GDNF.
We will examine the mechanism of GDNF regulation of mitochondrial health using gene knock down and over-
expression strategies. We will examine the role of GDNF-induced mitophagy in regulating hepatocyte survival.
Specific Aim 3: To establish that GDNF-loaded ginger lipid nanoparticles can prevent hepatic lipid
accumulation and promote hepatocyte survival. Our preliminary data demonstrate our ability to generate
liver-specific natural ginger nanoparticles. We will examine the effect of GDNF-loaded ginger nanoparticles on
hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte cell death and injury. GDNF-loaded ginger nanoparticles will be injected once
a week into WT, Sirt3 KO mice and PINK1 KO to further establish the mechanism of action of GDNF involving
Sirt3 and PINK1. Taken together our data from this proposal may provide novel targets for the treatment or
prevention of hepatic steatosis and injury."

We aim to establish that only specific circuit states of an identified connectome are modulated by circulating
hormones. Different circuit states are ones with at least some circuit neurons expressing modified cellular
(ionic currents) and synaptic properties. Most cellular-level mechanistic studies of circuit state modulation have
come from in vitro studies using arbitrary parameters or concentrations to stimulate individual modulatory
neurons or apply one or two neuromodulators. Thus far, little is known about the full complement of effective
modulators, such as within a population of hormones, during a specific behavioral state and whether they
influence all circuit states of a given connectome. We aim to bridge this gap by merging access to two defined
circuits in the isolated nervous system with our ability to deliver a natural source of hormones. We will
determine the response of different gastric mill (chewing)- and pyloric (passage of chewed food) circuit states,
configured by different applied neuromodulators, in the isolated crab (Cancer borealis) stomatogastric ganglion
(STG) to hemolymph ('blood') obtained from an unfed crab. By using the fully functional circuits in the isolated
STG, the direct influence of hormones can be determined without a background of variable, spontaneous
projection neuron influences. Our pilot data support the hypothesis that hormones from a single behavioral
state tune the output of only certain circuit states. Specifically, hemolymph from unfed crabs strengthens the
gastric mill rhythm and its regulation of the pyloric rhythm when configured by the peptide Gly1-SIFamide [G-
SIFamide] or CabTRP Ia [CabTRP]. These effects of unfed hemolymph occurred without any qualitative
change in circuit activity. In contrast, unfed hemolymph did not alter the STG circuit states configured by the
peptide proctolin or the muscarinic acetylcholine agonist oxotremorine. Using these four applied modulators
and hemolymph from unfed crabs, we aim to (a) fully characterize each circuit state response, (b) identify each
hormone influencing a particular circuit state, including determining their hemolymph concentration and
comparing their separate and combined influence to whole hemolymph, and (c) determine the underlying
cellular and synaptic mechanisms. To these ends, we will use electrophysiology to monitor and manipulate
circuit neuron activity, and mass spectrometric (MS) analyses for hormone identification and hemolymph
concentration. Because unfed hemolymph enhances without otherwise altering the G-SIFamide and CabTRP
actions, we hypothesize that the active hormone(s) either activate the same ionic current(s) as the applied
peptide, or they enhance the effective concentration of each peptide by inhibiting their cleavage. We will use
voltage- and dynamic clamp to test the ionic current hypothesis, and MS analysis to identify each peptide's
cleavage products and determine if their amount is reduced in hemolymph. A successful outcome will extend
the available insight into the selective influence of the hormonal environment from particular behavioral states
on different circuit states of a well-defined connectome at the cellular, synaptic and circuit level."
10894121,"1 Modern toxicology assessment of chemicals is under pressure from both scientific and social sources. Traditional
 2 study models using small numbers of highly inbred mammals fail to reflect the wide genetic, geographic, and
 3 demographic variation underlying differing population-specific responses to environmental toxicants and drugs.
 4 Secondly, long-standing public pressure to reduce the use of animals in safety testing has resulted in regulatory
 5 directives to ban the use of animal studies in approvals of new chemical entities and existing chemical product
 6 re-registrations by 2035. This pressure along with continual advances in life science technology has led to the
 7 development of new approach methods (NAMs) including in vitro, ethical in vivo, and in silico methods.
 8 Environmental justice, especially for vulnerable fence line communities at much greater risk of environmental
 9 exposure to chemicals, highlights the need to include vulnerable populations in toxicology studies. Modeling
10 population variation in toxic responses at the necessary throughputs is not feasible using outbred in vivo
11 mammalian models, and in vitro methods are unsuitable for assays requiring complete organisms such as
12 developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART). Using its novel vivoChip device, vivoVerse proposes a NAM
13 for DART testing based on the microscopic, soil-dwelling nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans has a
14 simple culturing protocol, ability to produce 300 progenies per adult, conserved toxicology pathways with
15 humans, intact germline with tractable in utero embryogenesis, is a non-sentient invertebrate with a 3-day life
16 cycle that is not subject to animal welfare legislation, and has well-characterized panels of several hundred
17 naturally occurring strains with diverse genetic backgrounds, making it a highly suitable small animal model for
18 DART assays. The vivoChip is a microfluidic-based imaging platform uniquely facilitating high-throughput
19 toxicology assays with C. elegans, using high-resolution imaging to quantify relevant phenotypic endpoints in
20 ~1,000 animals per chip. In Aim 1, we will develop a new vivoChip specifically for DART testing that allows rapid
21 immobilization of ~1,500 C. elegans of widely varying sizes. We will establish an AI/ML-assisted pipeline for
22 automated analysis of high-resolution, on-chip images of in utero, body, and organ phenotypes relevant to DART.
23 In Aim 2, we will develop a GLP-qualified DART assay that surveys 12 genetically diverse strains and
24 demonstrate strain and age-specific sensitivity for two reference chemicals. In Aim 3, we will compare DART
25 assessments with our panel of 12 strains and two sensitized mutants, with published data for chemicals of
26 significance to stakeholders, to demonstrate the value of our assay. With a more sensitive DART assay using
27 high-content readouts of in utero effects from twelve genetically diverse backgrounds, we expect to improve the
28 known safety prediction accuracies of C. elegans when compared to higher mammalian models. Armed with
29 such data, we will present our case study to the regulatory agencies for formal risk analysis, and in due course,
30 full acceptance of C. elegans as an alternative animal model for DART, making an impact on many industries."

Many children arrive at kindergarten unprepared to learn to read, at-risk of falling more behind, with major
inequities linked to race, geography and poverty (rates >50%). These are amplified during disruptions such as
COVID, when access to information and resources is perturbed. Low proficiency is strongly linked to adverse
school, vocational and health outcomes, with estimated costs >$350 billion/year. As parents are a child’s “first
and most important teachers,” home reading routines have a large impact on these outcomes. However, there
are wide disparities in these between high- and low-resource families, fueled by household stressors, cultural
differences, literacy challenges and other factors. Marginalized families also often face barriers to access of
reliable literacy-promoting information, programs and resources, worsening disparities. Given trusted access to
families when parenting routines are shaped, health providers are poised to help mitigate these barriers, yet
guidance tends to be general, inconsistent and can fade-out at home. The objective of the proposed project is
to enhance, “localize” and test a new, free mobile app designed to provide reliable shared reading guidance
and resources for parents (Reading Bees; RB) in an efficient, engaging way. The rationale is that no similar
approach exists, RB is free and designed to enhance existing programs, and there is evidence that its features
will be useful and effective. Content is evidence-based and has been co-developed with input from community
stakeholders and families from disadvantaged backgrounds. Core principles are clarity, credibility, flexibility
(e.g., parents set their own goals), responsiveness (child age, family concerns, ZIP), engaging content (tips,
videos, resources) and positive reinforcement (“LitCoin” awards). The long-term goal of this project is to use
RB to help improve reading and literacy outcomes. To achieve this, teams in 3 culturally distinct areas (OH,
WV, FL) will collaborate in a 3-year project. Content will first be added to address needs in each community:
lists of local reading-related resources curated by area stakeholders and a Spanish language version of RB.
Enhanced, “localized” RB will then be tested with parents in each area, first through focus groups to gauge
usefulness and guide refinement, and then by providing RB to parents (ages 0-6) during clinic visits and
measuring use over the next 2 months. Outcome measures involve feasibility, acceptance and useflness. The
central hypothesis is that local stakeholders will be engaged by the opportunity to highlight resources in their
area; families will rate RB content as useful and use RB often, especially to earn LitCoin awards; and improved
access to information and resources will fuel better reading and literacy outcomes. This work is significant and
innovative as it involves a tech-enabled, user-centered approach that is scalable within existing pediatric,
library and program infrastructure and empowers parents to read more interactively and access reliable
information. The expected outcome is that this work will provide vital enhancements to RB, show feasibility and
usefulness and provide a flexible, collaborative model to “localize” and scale use of RB into other areas."

Sandra Aleksic, MD, M.S.
 Mentor: Sofiya Milman, MD, M.S.
Co-mentors: Michael Lipton, MD, PhD; Joe Verghese, MBBS, MS
Abstract:
Mechanisms underpinning biological aging in humans remain incompletely understood. The hypothalamus
integrates key metabolic and neuroendocrine longevity pathways; therefore, hypothalamic dysfunction could
accelerate aging in humans. Recent studies in rodents identified aging-related hypothalamic microinflam-
mation, referred to as gliosis, which was characterized by accumulation and activation of microglia and
astrocytes. Gliosis caused hypothalamic dysfunction and accelerated aging, but prevention of hypothalamic
gliosis delayed aging. Despite growing evidence that the hypothalamus may regulate the aging process, its
role in human aging has not been investigated.
My hypothesis is that hypothalamic dysfunction accelerates aging in humans. To test this hypothesis,
we have devised a unique approach tailored to human aging cohorts. We will test two different measures of
hypothalamic dysfunction as predictors of cognitive decline, frailty, and reduced lifespan, which are features
of accelerated aging: 1) Neuroendocrine hypothalamic dysfunction is a functional measure, represented by
hypothalamic dysregulation of gonadal axis. 2) Hypothalamic gliosis is a structural measure, established by
neuroimaging MRI-DTI parameters. This proposal leverages an established prospective cohort of adults age
≥65 (n=1,200), LonGenity, with detailed biochemical and phenotypic assessments, including high-quality
brain MRIs (n=240), which will be analyzed with a novel automated MRI processing pipeline developed by
our group to efficiently and objectively study hypothalamic gliosis. My hypothesis will be addressed through
the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To establish the role of neuroendocrine hypothalamic dysfunction,
represented by hypothalamic dysregulation of gonadal axis at study baseline, in accelerating aging, deter-
mined by longitudinal assessments of neurocognitive scores, frailty index and all-cause mortality. Aim 2: To
establish cross-sectional relationships between hypothalamic gliosis and accelerated aging (2a) and neuro-
endocrine hypothalamic dysfunction (2b); and Aim 3: To identify circulating protein signatures of neuroen-
docrine hypothalamic dysfunction (3a) and hypothalamic gliosis (3b). This proposal will establish the role of
hypothalamic dysfunction in human aging and identify potential biological mechanisms that accelerate aging.
My career goal is to establish the role of the neuroendocrine system in the regulation of aging in
humans, and I have identified four main areas for further development over the 5-years of this K76 Award.
These include advanced training in 1) neuroimaging, 2) geriatrics, 3) data analysis, and 4) leadership. I have
devised, with input from my multidisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators, a comprehensive training
plan to attain knowledge and skills necessary to become a highly competent translational aging scientist
who will successfully compete for future R01 funding and lead the field of neuroendocrine regulation of
human aging into the future."

Although severe adverse consequences only occur in a subset of drinkers, alcohol abuse remains an ongoing
global health crisis linked to more than 5% of all premature deaths worldwide. In addition to wide individual
differences in susceptibility to developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD), there is increasing recognition that
AUD represents a wide spectrum of symptomatology and underlying pathophysiology which can vary across
individuals and throughout disease progression. As such, precision treatment strategies for AUD would be of
great utility, but individual differences in the efficacy of putative pharmacotherapeutic interventions have gone
largely understudied in preclinical models. The kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) system is a promising target for
precision applications, given that multiple widely prescribed treatments for AUD have significant KOR affinity,
and a range of KOR ligands are already in use for other disorders or in various stages of the clinical pipeline.
The goals of this proposal are to 1) understand the relationship between the actions of KOR ligands on specific
aspects of AUD-associated behaviors and 2) extend our basic understanding of the brain region-specific loci and
the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying KOR regulation of individual differences in drinking behaviors.
We approach these goals using operant alcohol self-administration in male and female mice, systemic and site-
specific pharmacology as well as ex vivo multi-photon microscopy and optopharmacology. Together, by
determining the behavioral impact of systemic pharmacological interventions as well as the neurophysiological
impact of spatiotemporally discrete manipulations, this proposal will build foundational preclinical knowledge
needed to advance precision targeting of the KOR system."
10912764,"Over 44 million immigrants live in the US, and nearly half (44%) are Latinx. Historically, US immigrants
have been reluctant to engage in public health infectious disease control measures such as testing, contact
tracing, vaccination, and prompt medical care. Yet the public's cooperation is essential if infectious disease
control measures are to succeed, especially among a marginalized subpopulation such as Latinx immigrants.
 Increasingly, commentators have noted the potential for immigration laws and concerns to deter
immigrants from engaging in communicable disease control measures. This may be especially true for
conditions of immigration significance that can be shrouded with negative legal and social connotations.
Findings from our studies of Latinx immigrants' immigration concerns related to largely individual-level public
health interventions--specifically use of services for HIV testing, substance use disorders and intimate partner
violence--confirms commentators' concerns, (1R01MD011573 PI: Galletly) and our preliminary study of Latinx
immigrants' legal concerns relevant to COVID testing, contact tracing, and treatment (R01MH091875-S1 PI:
Galletly) strongly suggest this influence applies to large scale, population-level disease control efforts as well.
 The proposed study will extend our research on the influence of actual, and importantly, perceived,
immigration-related laws on Latinx immigrants' use of HIV prevention services to examine the influence of
these on Latinx immigrants' ability and willingness to engage in population-level disease control efforts where
government direction is more prominent. Specifically, we propose to leverage the recent increased public
awareness of public health disease control measures to examine the influence of actual and perceived
immigration-related laws on Latinx immigrants' willingness to engage in testing, contact tracing, and treatment
as recommended by public health representatives when indicated for tuberculosis, hepatitis C, and COVID-19.
 Our interdisciplinary team of researchers, attorneys, community health workers and public health
representatives will collaborate on this mixed-methods, community-engaged study. Formative legal and
qualitative inquiry to identify the nature, extent, and influence of immigration-related law concerns will inform
the development of a de novo immigration law concerns measure to be administered to 1200 Latinx
immigrants living in two US regions with diverse immigration environments. Participants with diverse
documentation statuses, countries of origin, time spent in the US, and residence in rural/agricultural and urban
settings will be purposively sampled to further inform analysis of these complex behaviors.
 Identifying actual and perceived legal barriers to immigrants' engagement in disease control measures
can only be useful if results are transferred to practice. We will explore, with public health personnel, how best
to support the rapid transfer of findings to practice. Given that US public health departments conduct, finance,
or advise virtually all communicable disease control efforts, they are an ideal conduit for this."
10745356,"Abstract
 Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a permanent dilation of the abdominal aorta with a high mortality
greater than 80% after rupture. Aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are pivotal in maintaining aortic
structural integrity and function, and SMC-rich aortic medial stability is highly disrupted in AAA. Currently,
besides surgical interventions, no alternative therapeutics are available to blunt AAA progression and rupture.
Consequently, there is a dire need to identify novel strategies for development of effective, non-surgical
therapeutics. MicroRNA-146a (miR-146a), a well-known regulator of inflammation and auto-immunity, is highly
expressed in aneurysmal tissue of AAA patients. However, the role of miR-146a in SMC homeostasis and
AAA remains to be explored. In preliminary studies, by in-situ hybridization, we observed that miR-146a is
upregulated in SMC-rich aortic media of human and mouse AAAs; miR-146a deficiency significantly promoted
Angiotensin II (AngII) -induced AAA formation in normolipidemic mice co-administered with Lysyl oxidase inhibitor,
β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN); and mimetics-mediated miR-146a overexpression abolished AngII-induced AAAs in
both hypercholesterolemic LDLr-/- mice and normolipidemic mice co-infused with BAPN. To elucidate underlying
mechanisms, by RNA sequencing, we identified novel targets from miR-146a deficiency experiments: TFIID-31,
a TATA binding protein associated factor involved in transcriptional activation and repression, is significantly
upregulated; whereas Beclin-1, a gene indispensable for autophagy induction and USP9X, a deubiquitinase
critical for Beclin-1 stabilization, are significantly downregulated. Autophagy, a self-regulatory process by
which cells digest, and recycle their cytoplasmic materials for energy purposes under stress. Our preliminary
study also showed an increased Beclin-1 in mouse AAAs, as observed in human AAAs and Tat-peptide
mediated Beclin-1 activation suppressed AngII-induced AAA formation in mice. In addition, miR-146a
overexpression significantly suppressed TFIID-31, promoted USP9X and Beclin-1, and ShRNA-mediated
silencing of TFIID-31 increased USP9X in cultured aortic SMCs. Based on these observations, we will test our
central hypothesis that miR-146a activation protects against AAA formation and progression by promoting
Beclin-1-mediated aortic SMC homeostasis. By utilizing our unique mice models generated specifically for
these studies, we propose 3 aims. Aim 1 will test our working sub-hypothesis that miR-146a promotes Beclin-1
stability in aortic SMCs via a TFIID-31-USP9X –dependent manner. Aim 2 will test our working sub-hypothesis
that miR-146a activation protects against AAA through activation of SMC-Beclin-1-derived autophagy. Aim 3
will determine the effect of miR-146a / Beclin-1 activation on progression of established AAAs. In summary, we
will delineate the protective role of Beclin-1 in AAA and establish miR-146a activation as a novel therapeutic
strategy against AAA by targeting SMC-Beclin-1. This mechanistic research will set solid preclinical evidence
that targeting miR-146a represents a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment and prevention of AAA."

 The Animal Core is the center’s most active scientific hub for catalyzing in vivo genetic, molecular and
cellular research on the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver and pancreatic diseases (ALPD)
pursued by investigators within and outside of the center. The Core now generates 16 different versions
of preclinical models including a mouse model of alcohol-associated hepatitis which utilizes a hybrid
feeding technique of ad lib consumption of solid Western diet and intragastric feeding of ethanol diet plus
weekly ethanol binge. The Core also developed Western alcohol diet (WAD)-based tumor-promotion
models for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and patient-derived HCC xenograft (PDX) model; alcohol
diet-based promotion of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in KrasG12/D mice; and liver tumorigenesis by
orthotopic transplantation of liver tumor-initiated stem cell-like cells (TICs) in immunocompetent C57/Bl6
mice fed alcohol diet. Most recently, the Core has developed a novel humanized HCC mouse model with
humanization of parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cells and immune cells using fetal liver cells. In
this model, a combination of CRISPR/Cas9-based mutations of ARID1A and CTNNB1 common in
alcohol-associated patient HCC in hepatoblasts and WAD feeding results in a heightened HCC incidence
in FRG (Fah-/-;Rag2-/-;Il2rg-/-) mice, serving as an invaluable tool for studies on gene-environment
interactions and pre-clinical therapeutic testing in a humanized setting. These models developed and
produced by the Core will promote translational research on advanced ALPD and cirrhosis.
 During the current cycle, the Core produced 2,401 model mice to serve 24 center and 16 non-center
investigators, supporting 30 publications, 21 grant acquisitions and 8 applications by the center members
and 6 grants and 7 applications by non-center investigators. In addition, the Core’s Repository Program
has provided 333 samples to 16 investigators from 13 institutions across the nation to support their
research mostly funded by NIAAA.
 In the next cycle, the Animal Core will continue pursuing the following six specific aims to fulfill its
mission of serving the nation to advance ALPD research: 1) to serve as a national resource by provision
of 16+ different versions of rodent models which optimally recapitulate advanced and clinically relevant
pathologic spectra of ALPD; 2) to provide the humanized HCC mouse model as a widely available
service; 3) to support in vivo genetic analysis and cell fate mapping analysis; 4) to promote cell type
specific research via close collaboration with the center’s Integrative Liver Cell Core for better elucidation
of cell fate regulation underlying ALPD spectra; 5) to render full support to early-stage scientists including
those funded by the Pilot Project Core to maximize their potential for a successful transition to
independent investigators; and 6) to stimulate collaboration and synergize productivity by shared use of
the models and biospecimens available from the Repository Program."
10739248,"RP1: The role of endogenous retroviral elements in alcohol-associated liver disease
Project Summary
Alcohol associated health problems are a major medical burden in industrialized countries. Patients with
alcohol-associated liver disease show intestinal bacterial dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability.
Although there is considerable progress in understanding the interaction between the host and intestinal
bacteria, the role of the intestinal virome in alcohol-associated liver disease has not been investigated.
Preliminary data from our laboratories demonstrate that ethanol leads to chromatin remodeling and
transcription of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) in intestinal organoids and in the intestine of
ethanol-fed mice. Colonization of germ-free mice with feces from patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis
positive for fecal retroviruses increases ethanol-induced liver disease. This is supported by data
demonstrating that anti-retroviral treatment reduces intestinal ERVs and improves ethanol-induced liver
disease in gnotobiotic mice. Importantly, we demonstrate that ethanol-induced ERVs activate Z-nucleic acid
binding protein 1 (Zbp1) in intestinal epithelial cells. Mice with an intestinal epithelial cell specific deletion of
Zbp1 developed less severe ethanol-induced liver disease as compared with Zbp1-floxed littermates. The
testable central hypothesis of this proposed collaborative and multidisciplinary research application
implicates disturbances in the gut virome as an important etiological factor in the modulation of alcohol-
associated liver disease. Through the proposed study, we will characterize ERVs in a human cohort. We will
mechanistically test our hypothesis in a mouse model of ethanol-induced liver disease. Towards this goal,
we will use pharmacological interventions, microbiota humanized and genetically modified mice. We predict
that ethanol-mediated chromatin remodeling results in induction of ERV transcription in intestinal epithelial
cells (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that ethanol-induced ERVs activate Z-nucleic acid binding protein 1
(Zbp1) in intestinal epithelial cells contributing to cell death, increased intestinal permeability and ethanol-
induced liver disease (Aim 2). We believe these studies will provide important insights into alcohol-mediated
changes of the intestinal virome that result in gut barrier dysfunction and promote alcohol-associated liver
disease. Eventually this approach might lead to new therapeutic targets for patients with alcohol-associated
liver disease."
10739249,"RP2 – Nuclear PDH1 drives epigenetic TIC reprograming in alcohol-associated HCC
ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of malignancy-related mortality in the world.
Metabolic liver disease such as alcohol-associated liver disease (AALD), metabolic dysfunction associated
fatty liver disease (MAFLD) or a combination of both sometimes referred to both alcoholic and non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (BASH), are becoming a major etiologic background of HCC. Therapeutic efficacy
for HCC is limited due largely to therapy-resistance and recurrence in which tumor-initiating stem-like cells
(TICs) are implicated via their self-renewal activity driven by the pluripotency factor NANOG. Proposed
research addresses a novel epigenetic regulation of NANOG mediated by mitochondrion (mito)-nucleus
crosstalk in TICs which we hypothesize as a potential therapeutic target. The mito pyruvate
dehydrogenase (PDH1) is recently shown to translocate to the nucleus to supply acetyl-CoA from pyruvate
to stimulate H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in stem cells. We identified the RAB7 GTPase-activating protein
TBC1D15 as a novel oncoprotein responsible for p53 degradation and NOTCH activation. TBC1D15 is
now suggested to mobilize mitochondria (mito) by untethering mito-endosome interactions. Our
preliminary results reveal: 1) NOTCH Intracellular Domain (NICD), TBC1D15 and mito fission protein 1
(FIS1) form a tripartite complex at the mito outer membrane in TICs; 2) mito are closely associated with
nuclei in TICs and this spatial feature is diminished by TBC1D15 knockdown (KD) which disrupts the
tripartite interaction; 3) increased nuclear PDH1 in TICs is blunted by TBC1D15 KD; and 4) PDH1 KD or
inhibitor treatment reduces H3K27ac at the NANOG distal enhancer, NANOG expression and self-renewal
in TICs. These results collectively suggest a novel epigenetic mechanism of NANOG upregulation
mediated by PDH1 which is translocated to nuclei via a mito-nuclear proximity facilitated by the NICD-
TBC1D15-FIS1 interaction.
Hypothesis: Mito-nucleus transfer of PDH1 generates pyruvate-derived acetyl-CoA in nucleus and drives
sustained NANOG upregulation via H3K27ac of its enhancer. The NICD1-TBC1D15-FIS1 interaction
initiates this PDH1 nuclear translocation and is a plausible therapeutic target for alcohol-associated HCC.
Aim 1. To dissect molecular mechanisms of the mito-nucleus transfer of PDH1:
1.1. To test if NOTCH1-TBC1D15-FIS1 interaction facilitates perinuclear mito localization and PDH1
accessibility to the nucleus; 1.2: To test the proposed PDH1 transfer mechanism in human HCC organoids;
1-3: To perform in silico analysis to establish the 3-D structural basis for the NICD- TBC1D15-FIS1
interaction and to screen for small molecule inhibitors which target the interaction and characterize their
activities by fluorescence polarization and microscale thermophoresis assays.
Aim 2. To determine if nuclear PDH1 generates acetyl-CoA to increase H3K27ac at the NANOG enhancer
to promote NANOG expression, TIC self-renewal, and HCC development:
2.1. To test the ability of newly identified inhibitors for the NICD-TBC1D15-FIS1 interaction to suppress
nuclear PDH1 and acetyl-co A levels, H3K27ac at the NANOG enhancer, and its transcription in cultured
TICs. 2.2. To test the inhibitor modalities shown to be efficacious in vitro in PDX mice and humanized HCC
FRG mice.
In essence, the proposed research aims to establish a novel HCC therapeutic approach which specifically
targets NANOG epigenetic upregulation facilitated by PDH1 nuclear transfer."
10739250,"RP3: Characterization of Hepatic Stellate Cells (HSCs) in AALD
SUMMARY
Alcohol associated liver disease (AALD) is a leading cause of cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma,
and liver transplantation. The activation of Hepatic Stellate Cells (HSCs) in AALD produce myofibroblasts that
drive liver fibrosis. There are no therapies for AALD induced liver fibrosis. Because of animal models of AALD,
such as the intragastric ethanol model developed at our Center, we have some insights into HSC phenotypes
in mouse models. However, we currently know very little about the phenotypes of HSCs in human AALD. Nor
do we know if HSCs differ between AALD and NASH, two metabolic diseases that induce liver fibrosis. This
study is designed to identify genes expressed in human HSCs that specifically drive liver fibrosis in AALD
compared to NAFLD by analyzing HSCs from patients with these two diagnoses. Phenotypic changes in HSCs
occur without a change in the DNA sequence but are regulated on an epigenetic level, e.g. specific
modifications in the chromatin structure, which affect DNA accessibility of the regulatory transcription factors
(TFs), causing transcriptional activation or repression of their target genes. We will analyze human HSCs from
normal, AALD, NAFL, and NASH human livers that have been declined for liver transplantation. To gain insight
into gene expression and chromatin remodeling, we will analyze these livers by snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq.
We will identify genes that are expressed in HSCs at a higher level in AALD than in normal, NAFL, and NASH.
We have developed a rational three step approach to assess the functional consequences of this increased
gene expression in specific genes. 1) Knockdown the expression of the specific gene in human HSCs using
dsiRNA and assess their activation in 2D cultures. 2) Knockdown the expression of the specific gene in human
HSCs using dsiRNA in the context of a 3D human liver spheroid model of AALD. 3) Genetic deletion of the
specific genes in the mouse intragastric ethanol model of AALD. A complimentary approach will be used to
identify potential small molecules to target specific genes to suppress alcohol-specific HSC activation and halt
fibrosis. For this purpose, two Specific AIMs were developed.
AIM1. To assess the effect of deleting genes (identified in AIM1) specifically in HSCs.
AIM2. To assess the effect of blocking the expression of genes (identified in AIM1) specifically in HSCs.
We anticipate that our analysis will provide new insights into the regulation of alcohol-specific activation of
human and mouse HSCs and identify new targets for anti-fibrotic therapy."
10739251,"RP-4: Disruption of acinar cell NPC1/cholesterol pathway mediates alcoholic pancreatitis
SUMMARY
Alcoholic pancreatitis remains a disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, with no available treatments
directed at the mechanisms of the disease. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new approaches to reduce
the disease severity. Recent data indicate that disordering of lysosomal/autophagy and mitochondrial pathways
in acinar cells (the main cell type of the exocrine pancreas) drives pancreatitis, However the mechanisms of
organellar dysfunctions in pancreatitis, especially alcoholic pancreatitis, remain poorly understood. Our recent
study revealed that nonalcoholic pancreatitis in genetic and experimental models is associated with
dysregulation of acinar cell cholesterol metabolism, which promotes pancreatitis responses such as trypsinogen
activation, parenchymal necrosis, and inflammation. However, changes in acinar cell cholesterol homeostasis
and their role in organellar dysfunctions and disease severity have not been studied in alcoholic pancreatitis.
Our preliminary studies for this proposal, using mouse and cellular genetic and experimental models, indicate
that the level of lysosomal membrane protein NPC1, a key mediator of cholesterol transport, decreases in
alcoholic pancreatitis resulting in acinar cell cholesterol overload. We also found a dramatic decrease in
pancreatic NPC1 in human pancreatitis. The data further indicate that NPC1 loss is caused by its misfolding in
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) followed by its degradation. The disruption of NPC1/cholesterol pathway
promotes acinar cell lysosomal/autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunctions and worsens alcoholic pancreatitis in
experimental models. Our preliminary studies indicate that pharmacologic enhancers of the folding chaperone
HSP70 increase NPC1 stability and normalize cholesterol homeostasis and organelle functions. They suggest
that a key downstream mechanism linking the disrupted NPC1/cholesterol pathway and organellar dysfunctions
in alcoholic pancreatitis is hyperactivation of mTORC1 complex.
 This project will test the hypothesis that alcoholic pancreatitis is associated with loss of the key lysosomal
cholesterol transporter NPC1 caused by its misfolding and subsequent ERAD-proteasomal degradation. This
results in dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis in acinar cells. The disrupted NPC1/cholesterol pathway
promotes lysosomal/autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunctions via mTORC1 hyperactivation. Pharmacologic
HSP70 enhancers normalize NPC1/cholesterol pathway, mTORC1 activity and organelle functions, and alleviate
the severity of alcoholic pancreatitis.
 The proposed studies will establish NPC1/cholesterol pathway as an important clinically relevant modulator
of disease severity; and identify molecular targets, namely NPC1, HSP70 and mTORC1, for new
pharmacologic approaches to restore acinar cell cholesterol homeostasis and organellar functions and thus
alleviate the severity of alcoholic pancreatitis."
10739285,"CaV1.2 Ca2+ channels are critical conduits for Ca2+ entry into a diverse array of excitable cells. As such, these
channels must be precisely tuned to function appropriately for each cell type, and in response to varying
physiological cues. To this end, the channels employ multiple mechanisms of regulation, including alternative
splicing, voltage dependent inactivation and calcium dependent inactivation. However, a growing number of
mutations have been identified in CaV1.2, leading to severe phenotypes including neurological deficits, long-QT
syndrome (LQTS), and death. Timothy Syndrome (TS) represents one such class of mutations, in which a single
point mutation within CaV1.2 leads to a severe multisystem disorder characterized by developmental delays,
autism and profound LQTS. Many of the known TS mutations have been shown to decrease channel
inactivation, implicating Ca2+ channel blockers (CCBs) as a promising treatment option. However, despite some
modest success with verapamil, CCBs have had limited efficacy in treating TS. Here, we postulate that this lack
of efficacy may be due to a differential effect of CCBs on mutant versus wild type CaV1.2, necessitating the
exploration of alternative therapeutic options for these patients. We propose that manipulating CaV1.2 splicing
represents just such an alternative strategy, with significant promise for the treatment of these patients.
Specifically, as the majority of TS patients harbor a mutation within a mutually exclusive exon, we will design
antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeted to the exon containing the mutation. As such, we expect to force
the exclusion of the deleterious exon, induce inclusion of the unaffected alternate exon, and produce a fully
functional alternate channel splice variant. Importantly, this strategy will bypass the current limitations of
conventional therapies, providing significant clinical benefit for TS patients. Moreover, application of this
technique to WT CaV1.2 channels may lead to promising new therapeutic insights within a broader population of
patients. In particular, we will apply our splice modulating AONs to test the hypothesis that atypical splice
patterns in some patients may render them more susceptible to detrimental cardiac effects of DHP treatment.
Finally, as numerous genetic mutations occur within mutually exclusive exons, our application of AONs to TS
will serve as a generalizable strategy applicable to numerous genetic mutations in a multitude of proteins.
Overall, targeted manipulation of protein splicing represents a large and untapped opportunity, providing a path
forward for treatment of a diverse array of diseases."
10903887,"ABSTRACT
In-person administration is the current “gold-standard” for assessment of cognition and function
in studies of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia (ADRD). Remote neuropsychological
assessment has been advocated to overcome various access barriers and decrease costs of
neuropsychological services. Moreover, due to the pressing challenges and safety concerns
imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for robust methods for assessing
and monitoring cognitive and functional status through remote assessments. The overall goal of
the current project is to validate, refine, and calibrate the Remote Cognitive Aging and Alzheimer’s
Disease REsearch (R-CARE) Toolbox for the assessment and monitoring of cognition and
function in a diverse sample of initially dementia-free older adults. The toolbox will include
measures from the Uniform Data Set, Neuropsychological Battery (UDSNB-3.0), complemented
by frequently used tests in preclinical AD trials. In-person tests that pose challenges for remote
administration will be replaced with tablet-based computerized tasks. We will recruit 600
dementia-free, racially/ethnically diverse (~ 1/3 non-Hispanic Black, 1/3 Hispanic, and 1/3 non-
Hispanic White), community-residing participants aged ≥65 years. A randomized,
counterbalanced design will be used to administer a comprehensive clinical and cognitive battery
across both assessment modes (in-person vs. remote) separated by 2-6 weeks at baseline, with
follow up visits at 18 and 36 months. Digital biomarkers (computerized tests and speech-based)
and ADRD blood-based biomarkers will be collected. AIM 1: To evaluate the psychometric
properties of remote cognitive tests and assess their validity against standard in-person tests.
AIM 2: To evaluate comparability of longitudinal change in global cognition and within cognitive
domains across modes of assessment (in-person vs remote) for the whole sample as well as
subgroups defined by sex and race/ethnicity. AIM 3 (exploratory): To identify novel digital
biomarkers that provide incremental validity for differentiating clinical and pathological disease
stages, and for measuring and predicting cognitive and functional decline. Collectively, this study
will validate remotely administered tests across different cognitive domains, provide evidence for
cross-sectional and longitudinal validity, and provide normative data for remote tests in diverse
populations. Our long-term goal is to develop an open-source, reliable and valid toolbox that
would enable AD-researchers and clinicians to evaluate older adults from diverse backgrounds
regardless of ability to attend in-person visits.

10911359,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this renewal application is to provide support for mentoring of trainees and junior investigators in the
areas of sleep disorders and sleep health among patient populations who are “at risk.” The applicant’s current
research program focuses on treatment of sleep disorders in populations who have not been studied or who
have achieved less benefit from current evidence-based interventions. This program provides rich opportunities
for mentees to experience direct engagement in patient-oriented sleep research. Currently funded work focuses
on veterans with comorbid insomnia disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for whom standard
cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is less acceptable and less efficacious than among individuals
without PTSD. Based on emerging evidence that the theoretical underpinning and specific exercises of
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) present a viable approach to improving sleep when combined with
evidence-based behavioral strategies, a novel ACT-based insomnia treatment, called ""Acceptance and the
Behavioral Changes to Treat Insomnia (ABC-I) is being tested in a clinical trial. ABC-I combines core behavioral
components (sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, relaxation) with ACT-based techniques will be
evaluated in a randomized trial. Using a comparative effectiveness design (n=200 randomized to ABC-I or
cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)), the primary aims of the study are to evaluate the benefits of
ABC-I in reducing insomnia severity (non-inferiority) and PTSD symptoms (superiority) as compared to CBT-I.
Additional aims address potential mechanisms of change from before to after treatment and explore potential
ancillary benefits in terms of reducing other symptoms. The proposed analytic plan will simultaneously address
superiority of ABC-I over CBT-I for improving PTSD symptoms and non-inferiority of ABC-I compared to CBT-I
for improving insomnia symptoms. In addition to other ongoing and recently-completed projects, the study
provides rich opportunities for trainees to engage in all aspects of patient-oriented research on sleep disorders,
including direct interaction with research participants and engagement with data analysis and dissemination of
findings. The research environment at UCLA and VAGLAHS is rich with opportunities for learning and for
collaborative mentoring in areas of sleep health and sleep disorders. Building upon activities during the prior K-
24 award, the applicant will engage in formal leadership training and engage the support of a Leadership
Development Council."
