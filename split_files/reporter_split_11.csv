10842251,"Membrane receptors play a crucial role in many physiological processes throughout the body by
mediating communication between cells. Single molecule imaging has been used extensively to
study membrane receptor assembly and stoichiometry in vitro using isolated protein and to a
lesser extent cell culture. While studies in isolated cellular systems provide insight into many
processes, they lack the context of the complex environment present in an animal where
communication between cell types residing in tissue is critical for receptor activity. Single-
molecule imaging of native proteins synthesized in vivo would provide a direct approach to
measure processes, such as receptor dimerization, that regulate physiological activity. However,
current methods are not capable of applying single molecule techniques to study the regulation
of protein dynamics taking place within the complex environment of an animal. We have made
recent advances in the development of ex vivo single molecule techniques to monitor changes in
protein assembly that occur within specific organs. The goal of this proposal is to develop and
validate ex vivo single molecule tools that provide new capabilities to monitor the properties of
oligomeric membrane receptor assembly, resolve cell type and subcellular region specific single
membrane receptors, and automate single molecule data analysis using a machine learning
platform. This novel ex vivo technology will enable researchers to take a snap shot in time of the
membrane receptor dynamics that took place in the mouse and monitor changes in membrane
receptor assembly in response to changes in the animal's physiological environment such as
disease and exposure to therapeutics."

Transcriptional regulation via protein-DNA interactions plays an important role in the regulatory networks of all known
organisms. Bacterial regulatory networks are now an especially fruitful target for detailed investigation: as antibiotic-
resistant bacteria continue to emerge as a global health threat, new and innovative approaches to either preventing
virulence or impairing bacterial growth are required. As our ability to predict and exploit bacterial behavior for
therapeutic purposes hinges on our understanding of the logic behind their regulatory networks, it is of great utility to
fully map those networks and the molecular mechanisms underlying them.
 Several challenges, both old and newly recognized, stand in the way of a comprehensive understanding of
regulatory logic even in well-studied models such as Escherichia coli. In additional to classical cis-regulatory logic by
transcription factors and sigma factors, recent work by our laboratory and others has revealed contributions due to
chromosomal context, large heterochromatin-like regions of repressive occupancy of nucleoid-associated proteins,
overall three-dimensional chromosomal structure, and epigenetic modifications of both DNA-binding proteins and the
DNA itself that further modulate transcriptional regulation. In addition, for non-model bacteria even the fundamental
logic of classical transcriptional regulation is often poorly characterized. Thus, the fundamental regulatory logic behind
cellular decisions such as metabolic switches, motility, and induction of virulence is often under-characterized.
 We have developed several innovative technologies to assist in rapid characterization of bacterial transcriptional
regulatory logic, including: IPOD-HR, which allows overall profiling of protein occupancy on bacterial; transposon based
methods for rapidly profiling genome-wide effects of genetic context on transcription; and a method based on the
transposable phage Mu for crosslinking-free measurement of the 3D structure of the genome. Using these methods
alongside classical approaches such as bacterial genetics and ChIP-seq, we are pursuing several avenues of research to
investigate bacterial transcriptional regulatory networks. Key areas of interest include:
 Rapid elucidation of new transcriptional regulatory networks: Leveraging the IPOD-HR technology, which we
have shown can be readily applied to new bacterial species, we are mapping the set of cis regulatory interactions driving
important environmental responses in several clinically relevant bacterial species.
 Dynamics and composition of extended protein occupancy domains (EPODs): We have shown that highly protein
occupied, heterochromatin like EPODs are present in a broad range of bacterial species, and play key roles in regulating
prophages, virulence genes, and metabolic genes. We will continue to investigate the regulatory roles of EPODs, the
proteins that comprise them, and the factors dictating their formation/dissociation across a range of bacterial taxa.
 Interplay of bacterial epigenetic marks with TF binding and EPODs: By interfacing our IPOD-HR and ChIP-seq
experiments with tracking of covalent DNA and DNA-binding protein modifications, we will elucidate how these
modifications modulate both local and large-scale protein occupancy and transcription in bacteria."

The evolutionarily conserved Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway governs tissue morphogenesis during
development and contributes to tissue homeostasis in adults. Alteration of pathway activity drives
developmental disorders including Holoprosencephaly (HPE), Pallister-Hall Syndrome and Basal Cell Nevus
syndrome. Inappropriate activation of signaling post-developmentally is frequently associated with cancer,
being causative in basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, and implicated as a survival factor in a range of
additional tumor types. As such, there is significant interest and therapeutic potential in defining the
mechanisms governing SHH pathway activity. My laboratory’s long-term goal is to define the regulatory
processes governing SHH pathway activity during development and use this knowledge to identify
opportunities for targeting inappropriate SHH signaling in disease. Over the next 5 years, we will continue to
work toward this goal by interrogating and defining the molecular mechanisms controlling pivotal regulatory
steps of the SHH signal transduction cascade. We are focused on elucidating 1) how SHH ligand release and
transport are controlled to establish a morphogen gradient, 2) how SMO activation is controlled and how it
coordinates its activity with other G protein coupled receptors at the primary cilium, and 3) how GLI
transcriptional activator induction and destabilization are coordinated to assure an appropriate transcriptional
response."
10828809,"Decades long effort to translate pre-clinical research into treatments have failed; there are no effective
molecular-targeted therapies to treat sepsis. Substantial progress in supportive treatments with fluid
resuscitation, timely antibiotics have decreased acute-phase mortality but now a significant proportion
of sepsis and septic shock victims develop, chronic critical illness (CCI). During CCI, the long term
mortality increases from secondary infections and cardiovascular causes. Predicting ultimate fate of
sepsis patients, survival versus death or CCI and ability to respond to secondary infections is difficult.
Immune response in sepsis undergoes a dynamic reprogramming from hyper-inflammation with
immune resistance of pathogen that gives way to a hypo-inflammatory response with immune
tolerance, within hours/days. Leukocyte adhesion, earliest in vivo inflammatory response, is
instrumental to the “resistance” vs. “tolerance” and serves as a “window” to the host immune response.
Sirtuins (SIRTs), a highly conserved family or proteins regulate the shift from hyper- to hypo-
inflammation, including leukocyte adhesion in rodent sepsis. This project will focus on two basic
strategies in to identify the hyper- vs. hypo-inflammatory phase and treat in a phase-specific manner.
Project 1: Establish temporal based physiological marker and biomarkers to distinguish
sepsis phases (GAP 1): Under this aim, we will establish: 1) A rapid in vitro assay of leukocyte
(peripheral blood mononuclear cells: PBMC) adhesion response to secondary stimuli and 2) SIRT1 and
SIRT2 as biomarkers, to identify hypo-inflammatory phase of sepsis. We will study adhesion response
and SIRT biomarker profile during sepsis/septic shock progression in each patients at least at three
different time points and correlate the profile changes with clinical outcomes.
Project 2: Determine the effect of temporal based phase-specific modulations of SIRT1
and 2 on response to secondary stimuli (Gap 2): Using patient PBMCs (monocytes) at different
time points during sepsis/septic shock progression and treating with SIRT1 and SIRT 2
activation/inhibition with genetic and pharmacological approaches, I will study the effect of SIRT
modulation on: 1) Monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion response to secondary stimuli, 2) Immune
response and 3) Bioenergy and metabolic responses during sepsis progression.
Impact: The completion of these studies will 1) Identify markers/biomarkers to identify sepsis phases,
2) Correlate the immuno-metabolic response profile of PBMCs during sepsis progression and patient
outcomes, 3) Identify SIRTs 1 and 2 (and potentially other metabolic/inflammatory molecules) as
phase-specific therapeutic agents."

Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic biopolymers, which serve as major highways for intracellular transport. MT
networks are critical for cell physiology, and their disturbance underlies many human diseases. My laboratory
studies global mechanisms allowing MTs to perfectly attribute to specific cellular functions.
MT-dependent transport arranges multiple cell components at the same time. To address these complex
requirements, MT geometry, molecular motor affinity, and/or MT association with to other cell components are
tightly regulated. MT network geometry changes depending on the sites of new MT outgrowth (the MT-organizing
centers, or MTOCs), local stabilization/disassembly of MTs, and MT anchoring to other structures. Furthermore,
the affinity of individual MTs to molecular motors can be modulated to affect intracellular transport. Finally, MTs
can scaffold proteins or be cross-linked with other cytoskeletal components. All those mechanisms that tailor MT
organization to distinct cell functions can respond dynamically to cell-signaling inputs and the physiological
context. Together, molecular regulation and functional specialization of MT networks comprise a global field in
basic cell biology with numerous unanswered questions. My research program’s long-term goals include
defining: how interphase MT networks are built and regulated; specific mechanisms tailoring MT
biochemistry and geometry to specific cellular needs; the methods whereby MTs collaborate with other
cellular systems to build intracellular space; and, how MTs switch their functional loads between distinct
tasks to arrange integral cell architecture under changing signaling conditions.
Since April 2018, the NIGMS MIRA funding mechanism has been an invaluable resource allowing us to explore
these basic, fundamental biological problems. We have published several central advances toward our global
and interactive goals. Among other findings, we brought a new mechanistic understanding of Golgi-derived MT
networks (GDMTs, which were identified in our prior studies); described novel, surprising functions for MT-
associated proteins (MAPs) tau, CLASP2, and CAMSAP2; utilized collaborations with experts in computational
modeling for deep understanding of MT functions in secretory trafficking and actin cytoskeleton dynamics; and,
discovered a previously overlooked, physiologically important Golgi complex behavior in the cell cycle.
In the next five years, I will extend mechanistic and functional insights in two broad directions of my program’s
extant NIGMS-funded research. (I) We will determine how the versatility of MT functions is tuned by
multifunctional MAPs, focusing on (a) secretory trafficking through the Golgi axis and (b) the organization of the
actin cytoskeleton. Initial studies will evaluate the roles of MT regulators CLASPs and a MT-stabilizing tumor
suppressor RASSF1A. (II) We will expand our studies of MT-dependent Golgi positioning to dissect (a) molecular
mechanisms driving this process and (b) the significance of Golgi relocation in distinct cell cycle stages."

Advanced NMR, computational, and hybrid methods for metabolomics
The emergence of metabolomics promises to revolutionize the understanding of biological systems
from a metabolite perspective with important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of disease.
Despite recent progress in the profiling and quantitation of complex metabolomics mixtures, such as
urine, serum, and cancer tissue, by NMR and mass spectrometry, important methodological challenges
remain. The proposed research program aims at addressing some of these urgent challenges by
developing new approaches to integrate NMR with cheminformatics and mass spectrometry for the de
novo characterization of unknown metabolites and their chemical and structural motifs, by developing
and maintaining advanced webservers and metabolomics databases (COLMAR) for the reliable,
efficient, and user-friendly analysis of highly complex metabolomics spectroscopic data, by developing
automated tools for the spectral deconvolution and quantitation of complex metabolomics mixtures with
synergies for protein NMR applications, and by developing new hybrid approaches to bridge
metabolomics with other Omics fields. The proposed research will promote the dissemination of
metabolomics as a powerful, versatile, and manageable tool to the biomedical scientific community with
synergistic benefits also for protein science. These activities are expected to lead to a better
understanding of a broad range of biological questions from a metabolite perspective for the benefit of
human health."

The burden of sickle cell disease (SCD) is highest in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where over 75% of patients
currently reside. Tanzania is one of the countries most affected by the disease with an estimated 11,000 births
a year, the 5th highest in the world. Major challenges in addressing the burden of SCD in SSA have been the
lack of multi-site, well described cohorts of SCD patients; failure to deploy consistent standards of care; human
resource capacity that is limited in number and skills and limited research in areas pertinent to SCD in the African
context. In 2017 three SSA countries, Tanzania, Ghana and Nigeria, teamed up to establish the Sickle
Pan-African Research Consortium (SPARCO) to address these challenges. Building on successes achieved to
date, SPARCO-Tanzania aims to expand as the Center of Excellence in Training and Research in SCD with the
long term goal to advance the care for SCD and contribute to the consortium in generating evidence that will
inform the deployment of effective interventions in SSA. Specifically, SPARCO-Tanzania aims to 1) Enhance
communication and collaboration with members of the SCD in SSA Network to engage in continent-wide
research and create a “Policy Translation Group” that will embed evidence-based best practices in national
policy, 2) Increase the quantity and quality of data in the SPARCO database by i) increasing the number of
enrolled SCD patients to 7,000 by integrating a new satellite site in Zanzibar and implementing newborn
screening (NBS) across the country, (in collaboration with the America Society of Hematology); ii) using SMS
reminders and age-specific patient educational programs to boost clinic attendance at follow-up visits to collect
longitudinal data; 3) Enhance the utilization of the customized multi-level SCD Standards of Care (SoC) in the
Tanzanian health system by engaging with the Ministry of Health to promote the adoption and use of the SoC
from tertiary care level to home; 4) partner with existing programs in and outside the consortium to conduct
short, medium and long term training and fellowship programs on the clinical management and research on SCD
to strengthen skills in SCD care and research; and 5) Conduct cohort studies to improve understanding of
current status of the disease and risk-modifiers (specifically on the genetic variability in fetal hemoglobin and
kidney dysfunction and effect of Hydroxyurea on immune activation), and implementation research to evaluate
planned interventions (specifically the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of NBS, Hydroxyurea usage
and malaria prophylaxis) aiming at elucidating best approaches to scale-up introduction of these preventive and
therapeutic interventions in the local context. Collectively, the project will increase the amount and quality of
data on SCD in SSA, enable growth of a critical mass of researchers and generate evidence that will inform
policy change which, concurrent with the growth in the standards of care, will lead to the reduction in the
morbidity and mortality due to SCD in SSA."

While the outcomes for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved dramatically over the
past four decades, major challenges remain including the burden of conventional therapy and less progress in
major subgroups making ALL one of the leading causes of cancer death in children. Thus, targeted, more effec-
tive therapies are urgently needed. The current project builds on our recent studies implicating the epigenome
in transformation and response to therapy. Recent advances in chromatin conformation capture techniques have
revolutionized our understanding of chromatin organization and have provided novel insights at an unprece-
dented level of detail. Several studies have identified biologically-relevant structures in DNA-DNA contact maps,
such as A/B compartments, topologically-associating domains (TADs), and insulated neighborhoods, and have
elucidated the role of chromatin architecture in gene regulation and maintenance of cell identity. A handful of
very recent studies from our lab and others have shown that aberrant TAD activation or “rewiring” promoter-
enhancer interactions can promote cancer growth. However, no study has yet addressed the disruptions of chro-
matin organization on a genome-wide scale in cancer patients or how such disruptions modify the promoter-
enhancer landscape leading to leukemia initiation and therapy resistance and relapse. This study aims to ad-
dress these gaps by comparing the chromatin landscape in B ALL samples and normal B precursor cells to
identify chromatin architecture associated with transformation and to chart the evolution of topographic changes
from diagnosis to relapse using paired samples to discover 3D alterations associated with tumor progression. In
preliminary data, we have analyzed a small pilot cohort of 12 patients with matched diagnosis/relapse samples.
In this small cohort, we have already identified chromatin reorganization events at multiple levels: compartment
switches, changes in intra-TAD chromatin interactions, establishment of enhancer-promoter loops and structural
alterations that directly affect 3D topology. Such changes will be validated in preclinical models using genetically
engineered cell lines in vitro and in vivo as well as patient derived xenografts (PDX). Finally, to examine the
subclonal composition of promoter-enhancer loops we will use single cell DNA/RNA FISH and will use the same
methodology to track evolution in PDX models."

High affinity IgE antibodies are essential mediators of food allergy, a main cause of life-threatening anaphylaxis.
Most food allergies develop in childhood and affect children disproportionally. A long-standing question in the
allergy field is why allergies to some foods spontaneously cure, while others persist. A key to understanding the
evolution of food allergy may reside in the mechanisms that maintain the B cell memory of high affinity IgE
responses. Experimental studies from our group demonstrated that IgE cells exist mostly as plasma cells and
not IgE memory cells, and that high affinity pathogenic IgE antibodies derive from the sequential switching of
affinity matured IgG1 memory B cells. While the origin of human high affinity IgE is not definitely proved, an
increasing body of work supports a precursor role of IgG memory cells in the generation of human pathogenic
IgE plasma cells. We hypothesize that the existence of high affinity food-specific IgG cells and their ability to
undergo class switching to IgE are critical for allergy persistence. Preliminary studies from our group suggest
that atopic individuals harbor B lymphocytes with a distinct profile that increases their response to activation and
differentiation into IgE plasma cells. We postulate that the atopic immune environment marks allergen-specific
IgG memory cells with a ‘pro-allergic’ signature, and that the presence of these pro-allergic memory cells is
necessary for the development and persistence of food allergy. We propose to investigate the existence of pro-
allergic memory B lymphocytes in food allergic children, in children that outgrew their food allergy, in tolerant
never-allergic children, and in children with non-allergic inflammatory disease. We will determine if memory B
cells that recognize food allergens have a specific phenotype that distinguish them from memory B cells that
recognize virus and vaccines antigens in allergic and non-allergic children. We expect that the findings from this
study will provide tools to predict food-allergy risk and persistence, and help to design new therapies for allergic
diseases."
10857301,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Influenza affects over 15 million infants each year worldwide resulting in approximately 400,000 severe cases
and 10,000 deaths annually. Maternal influenza immunization (MII) during pregnancy protects infants against
disease, presenting tremendous opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality. Protection occurs through three
mechanisms: decreased infant exposure to maternal infections, transplacental vaccine-specific antibody (Ab),
and possibly breastmilk vaccine-specific Ab. Yet, there are critical gaps in our understanding of MII including
optimal timing of immunization, defined correlates of Ab protection in infants, and the importance of vaccine Ab
in breastmilk. The overarching goal of this research is to address these gaps by investigating the
epidemiologic and immunologic protection provided to infants against influenza through immunization during
pregnancy with a focus on breastmilk-mediated protection. Utilizing a retrospective cohort of 49,000 mother-
infant pairs at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), Aim 1a will examine the individual and
combined associations between infant exposure to MII and breastmilk and risk of infant influenza to determine
if the combination of MII and breastmilk results in synergistic protection against influenza. Aim 1b will use this
cohort to determine whether the timing of MII during pregnancy affects the likelihood of infant influenza
occurrence, while controlling for consumption of breastmilk. Aim 2 will use an infant influenza case/control
study design to determine the influenza-vaccine specific Ab titer in serum (Aim 2a) and breastmilk (Aim 2b)
that correlates with protection against influenza. Cases and controls will be identified among approximately 440
mother-infant pairs who will be recruited from the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) study at UPMC
over four consecutive influenza seasons with specimens collected. NVSN is a Center for Disease Control and
Prevention study of children with acute respiratory illness and asymptomatic controls. Accomplishment of these
aims will significantly improve our understanding of the protection provided to infants through maternal
influenza immunization and significantly expand our understanding of vaccine-Ab in breastmilk, setting the
stage for future interventions to protect this vulnerable population. With guidance from committed mentors and
strong institutional support, the PI will also receive the necessary intensive mentorship, didactic education, and
research experience to become an independent investigator, supporting career development objectives in
advanced quantitative methods, leadership in team science, hands-on experience in human subjects’ research
and laboratory training in infectious diseases and immunology. This work will provide essential preliminary data
to support future grant applications with a continued focus in infant protection through maternal vaccines. With
these new skills and novel preliminary data, the PI will be poised to lead large studies maternal-infant vaccine
research, ultimately improving maternal-infant health and furthering NIAID’s mission to understand, treat and
prevent infectious diseases."

The isoprene unit is a structural motif found in >80,000 natural products and is usually critical for biological
activity and modulation of pharmacological properties. Yet, our ability to access isoprenoids and diversify their
structures has been extremely limited. The complexity of isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways, the difficulty of
rationally overcoming multiple critical bottlenecks, and the narrow substrate scope of many components have
hampered attempts at forward engineering isoprenoid biosynthesis to expand chemical space. Consequently,
the full synthetic potential of isoprenoid biosynthesis has yet to be realized. As part of the long-term goal of
reprogramming the biosynthesis of natural products for the synthesis of potential therapeutics, the overall
objective of this proposal is to leverage the simplicity, modularity, and versatility of our recently described Alcohol
Dependent Hemiterpene (ADH) pathway to isoprenoid building blocks by coupling it to downstream biosynthetic
chemistry and applying directed evolution to isoprenoid biosynthesis. Our hypotheses are (1) the simplicity of
the ADH pathway facilitates access to isoprenoids, (2) bottlenecks to decorated terpenes can be overcome by
directed evolution, and (3) the limited specificity of prenyltransferases can be expanded by directed evolution.
These hypotheses are supported by (1) data that validates the ability of the ADH pathway to support production
of isoprenoids,26 (2) development of genetically-encoded biosensors for in situ terpene detection, (3) preliminary
data that demonstrates the feasibility of enzymatically generating non-isoprene building blocks in vitro and in
vivo and coupling them to downstream isoprenoid biosynthesis,27 (4) preliminary data that reveals
prenyltransferase promiscuity as a platform for directed evolution, and (5) development of a prenyltransferase
high-throughput screen. The rationale for the proposed research is that our approach of directed evolution
enables access to a variety of medicinally relevant isoprenoids including new-to-nature compounds. To address
these hypotheses, and to complete the overall objective of this proposal, the following specific aims will be
completed: (1) overcome bottlenecks to oxygenated terpenes via biosensor-guided engineering and (2) expand
isoprenoid chemical diversity via prenyltransferase directed evolution. Our approach is highly innovative because
directed evolution of isoprenoid biosynthesis has previously been limited to colorimetric terpenes and our chemo-
enzymatic strategy to isoprenoids offers unprecedented scope, versatility, modularity, and utility. The proposed
research is significant because it is expected to have broad positive impact in natural product biosynthesis and
synthetic biology by advancing new strategies for natural product biosynthesis and enabling access to
biologically active natural products not readily accessible by genetic manipulation or conventional organic
synthesis."
10851961,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Vibrio cholerae causes 3 million cases of cholera and 100,000 deaths annually. Young children are most
vulnerable to cholera, yet they are not protected by current vaccines. More aggressive approaches are needed
to prevent the cholera, especially in young children. To meet this challenge, the World Health Organization has
targeted the elimination of the global threat of cholera transmission by the year 2030, but the strategic
approach to achieve this ambitious goal has not yet been determined.
 For patients with cholera, effective antibiotic treatment dramatically reduces the severity of infection and
prevents the release of trillions of V. cholerae bacteria into the environment. However, while antibiotics are
often effectively used to prevent other infections, there are no standards for the use of antibiotics to prevent
cholera. As a result, there is tremendous variation in practice, and antibiotics with unproven efficacy are
frequently given to prevent cholera. These unproven approaches may needlessly contribute to antibiotic
resistance in both V. cholerae and important bystander bacteria as well. For this reason, the World Health
Organization Task Force on Cholera Control has recommended a halt to widespread antibiotic use for
preventing cholera, and instead recommends that studies be done to test the effectiveness of antibiotics for
cholera prevention as well as their impact of this on antimicrobial resistance.
 Our proposal addresses this exact knowledge gap. We will determine whether single-dose azithromycin is
effective in preventing V. cholerae infection in children who live in a household where there has been a case of
cholera. Without intervention, these children have a 30% chance of developing infection within one week.
While a single-dose of azithromycin is a preferred treatment for cholera, azithromycin to prevent cholera has
never been studied. Azithromycin has been found to be beneficial in other mass prevention studies in children,
but the impact of single-dose of azithromycin on antibiotic resistance has not been sufficiently tested. We
anticipate that this study will result in the more effective and judicious use of antibiotics to prevent cholera in
children."

A major cause of male infertility is defective and atypical development of the Wolffian duct, the
embryonic structure that give rise to male internal reproductive tract organs. It is known that
Wolffian duct differentiation is predominantly driven by the action of the testis-derived
androgens. However, how the androgen signaling coordinates the process of the Wolffian duct
differentiation remains unclear in the field of reproduction. The androgen action in Wolffian duct
differentiation is mediated by the androgen receptor (AR), which is expressed in both Wolffian
duct epithelium and mesenchyme. Using a new mesenchyme-specific Ar knockout mouse
model, we provided the first genetic evidence that the AR in the mesenchyme is essential for
Wolffian duct differentiation. By comparing chromatin accessibilities and transcriptomes of
Wolffian duct mesenchymes from female and male embryos, we discovered a set of androgen-
induced chromatin accessible regions and a new androgen-induced mesenchymal factor R-
Spondin 3 (Rspo3). RSPO3 is a WNT signaling activator secreted from the mesenchyme to
activate epithelial Wnt signaling that is essential for Wolffian duct morphogenesis. While the
mesenchyme governs epithelial differentiation, the epithelium has the reciprocal inductive
effects on the mesenchyme by synthesizing a paracrine growth factor WNT9B. We found that
the loss of Wnt9b caused Wolffian duct degeneration at the sexual differentiation window when
the androgen signaling was supposed to promote Wolffian duct survival. These observations
lead to and support our central hypothesis: the androgen-dependent Wolffian duct differentiation
requires the stimulation of the epithelium-derived WNT9B, and the androgen signaling in
Wolffian duct differentiation is mediated by the mesenchymal AR and executed by the
androgen-induced mesenchymal factor RSPO3 via epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. We will
determine the mechanisms of WNT9B, AR, RSPO3 actions in promoting Wolffian duct
differentiation by utilizing a combination of tissue-specific gene knockouts, gene expression
assays, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and single cell mRNA-seq. AR
and WNT9B variants in humans have been associated with defective androgen-dependent male
reproductive tract differentiation. Therefore, the completion of our proposal will not only yield
fundamental knowledge of basic mechanisms underlying androgen-dependent Wolffian duct
differentiation but also provide knowledge directly relevant to our understanding of disorders of
male sexual development in humans."
10839806,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a serious public health problem. AD is the most common cause of dementia, which
is pathologically characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles
in the brain. AD is clinically manifested as progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment, leading to
prolonged disability and eventual death. Yet, the cellular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis are not fully
understood and no effective therapy is currently available for AD. Our preliminary data point to the important role
of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in the choroid plexus (ChP) and tanycytes that is
significant in the optimal regulation of amyloid-beta (A) and tau efflux. We found that deletion of LRP1 in the
ChP leads to a significant decrease in A clearance from the CSF into circulation. Interestingly, we also found
that LRP1 in tanycytes is necessary to regulate tau clearance from the CSF to the blood. Importantly, LRP1
physically binds to leptin receptor (LepR) in response to A or tau. Furthermore, we observed that diet-induced
overnutrition impairs A clearance from the brain and obesity-related metabolic parameters negatively correlate
with short-term memory. We therefore hypothesize that LRP1 in the ChP and tanycytes is essential for regulating
A and tau clearance, which is coupled with the LepR to exert transcytosis of these proteins from the CSF to
circulation. Thus, an impaired LRP1 action causes A and tau accumulation in the brain, leading to AD. Obesity
further aggravates LRP1-dependent A and tau efflux, accelerating cognitive decline. To this end, we will (i)
establish the role of LRP1 in controlling A efflux in the choroid plexus; (ii) explore the significance of LRP1 in
regulating tau transport in tanycytes. To accomplish these goals, we will employ state-of-the-art biochemical,
molecular, cellular, and metabolic physiological techniques, including genetically engineered tissue-specific
transgenic mouse models, in vivo live two-photon imaging, and Cre-inducible AAV system. These studies will
provide a unique opportunity to establish a novel mechanism implicating LRP1 as a key determinant of A and
tau efflux. The data generated from these timely studies may offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms
of LRP1-dependent A and tau clearance in the etiopathogenesis of AD and provide new therapeutic targets for
AD and related dementia."

Compared to Whites, Blacks carry a disproportionate burden of chronic disease and early mortality.
These health disparities have been linked with high levels of psychosocial stress experienced by Blacks
(e.g., poverty, interpersonal violence, and discrimination), but the biological mechanisms linking
psychosocial stress with health disparities across the lifespan remain poorly understood. Similarly, the
extent to which multi-level protective factors (e.g., from individual, interpersonal, and community
domains) mitigate the effects of early life stress on health outcomes and underlying biological
mechanisms is unknown. This proposal will investigate the hypothesis that early life stress produces
DNA methylation profiles that contribute to health disparities in early markers of chronic disease across
several age groups, and these effects are modified by protective factors from individual, interpersonal,
and community domains. To achieve the goals of this project, we will capitalize on an existing
longitudinal study, Healthy Passages, which collected prospective, multi-informant data on a variety of
early life stressors and protective factors in over 1,000 individuals (65% Black, 35% White, 50% female)
in Birmingham, Alabama at ages 11, 13, 16, and 19. The proposed project will conduct a follow up
assessment on 800 young adults from this cohort (average age 28) and 400 of their offspring (ages 0 to
5). It will involve a comprehensive evaluation of cardiometabolic indicators associated with later chronic
disease (obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and inflammation) in the young adults; assessment of
prenatal and postnatal stress and protective factors in the offspring; and analyses of saliva DNA from the
young adults at ages 19 and 28, and their offspring. The combination of existing and newly collected
data will be used to 1) identify DNA methylation variations that are associated with early life stress and
cardiometabolic indicators across three developmental periods – early childhood, late adolescence, and
young adulthood; 2) examine the role of race in stress-related DNA methylation and cardiometabolic
indicators across the three developmental periods; and 3) identify multi-level protective factors that
modify the effects of early life stress on DNA methylation across the three developmental periods. The
findings of this study will provide novel insights into stress-related epigenetic mechanisms that may
explain racial health disparities across the lifespan, as well as multi-level protective factors that may
interrupt the biological embedding of adversity. Better understanding of the role of epigenetics in health
disparities may lead to development of epigenetic biomarkers for early diagnosis of disease, ability to
identify susceptible individuals at risk for adult disease, and development of novel preventive and
curative measures that would reduce health disparities."

Opioid overdose deaths remain at crisis levels; however, increasing availability of effective medications for
opioid use disorder (MOUD) are one reason for optimism. Unfortunately, MOUD are underutilized. Real-world
data have identified low MOUD retention rates in contrast with higher retention rates observed in randomized
controlled trials (RCTs). While comparative effectiveness RCTs found that buprenorphine-naloxone and
extended-release naltrexone have similar retention and illicit opioid use, observational studies identify lower
rates of fatal opioid overdose and improved retention with buprenorphine-naloxone. While RCTs are
considered the gold standard for studying causal relationships, external generalizability is limited, and RCTs
have limited power to study relatively rare outcomes such as fatal or nonfatal opioid overdose. The
Massachusetts Public Health Data warehouse (PHD) is a novel near population-level database linking more
than 20 state-based datasets at the individual level. The PHD offers an unparalleled ability to study a breadth
and depth of opioid-related exposures and outcomes, including opioid overdose. The current proposal seeks to
use PHD to emulate target comparative effectiveness trials of a rapidly expanding array of buprenorphine and
naltrexone formulations. We will examine MOUD initiation following opioid detoxification, a common treatment
entry point for individuals at high-risk for subsequent opioid overdose. To advance understanding of the
differences between observational studies and RCTs we will directly compare effect estimates of treatment
retention from an emulated trial in PHD with a reanalysis of the target X:BOT RCT that compared sublingual
buprenorphine-naloxone and extended-release naltrexone. Using the PHD, we will examine additional
outcomes, including fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose. We will leverage the emulated trial framework
developed to study additional high priority comparative effectiveness questions. We will compare outcomes
from initiation of sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone versus buprenorphine extended-release formulations
following opioid detoxification. Finally, while long-term MOUD treatment is the standard of care, many patients
prefer to stop treatment. We will assess the impact of tapering sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone after 3 or 6
months of treatment compared with continued use. The findings of these comparative effectiveness analyses
will inform policy and practice on the coverage and use of an expanding array of MOUD formulations."
10824258,"Seeds to STEM (S2S) proposes a bilingual program that educates urban children ages 3- 5,
their families, and preschool teachers about the importance of childhood nutrition, early
STEM and literacy, and kindergarten readiness in order to address national needs to diversify
the STEM education pipeline and reduce disproportionate rates of poverty, hunger, ill health,
and low educational achievement among families living in dense cityscapes. This SEPA
project has an innovative focus on food access and families enrolled in under-accredited early
learning centers, including home-based childcare.
These low-cost options, often chosen by families who work but cannot afford or do not have
access to high quality early childhood learning and care resources, need to be better
incorporated into preschool education improvement initiatives.
We hypothesize that a research- and asset-based approach to simultaneously educating
preschool children, their teachers, and families will promote early STEM and literacy
learning, encourage healthy eating habits, and increase kindergarten readiness among low
income families living in two major cities -- Philadelphia, PA, and Los Angeles, CA. Three
product deliverables will be nationally distributed by the end of a SEPA grant period via a
project website and PI connections to professional networks. In addition to project
participants, nine museums have appended Support Letters to this application.
1 A bilingual inquiry-based curriculum about early childhood nutrition and school
 readiness that integrates STEM, literacy, and numeracy learning through
 experimental activities growing food inside classrooms, urban gardens, and
 family homes;
2 Professional development and in-class coaching for under-accredited pre-K
 educators including, as an innovation, home-based childcareproviders;
3 Programs that empower families to learn together, understand kindergarten
 readiness, and be more connected to nutrition resources in their communities."
10800697,"Gestational diabetes (GDM), or hyperglycemia that first manifests during pregnancy, worsens pregnancy outcomes and long-term health risks for both a mother and her offspring. As with all types of diabetes, a relative insufficiency of functional pancreatic β-cells is a fundamental defect contributing to GDM. Normally, β-cells adapt to the metabolic challenges of pregnancy by expanding β-cell mass. This expanded mass regresses in the postpartum period. Thus, pregnancy is a unique physiologic condition that occurs in a fully-developed adult and requires rapid, dynamic changes in β-cell mass. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of normal gestational β-cell adaptation and the defects underlying GDM are poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms regulating β-cell proliferation and mass during pregnancy, in order to leverage that knowledge for therapeutic expansion of β-cells in all types of diabetes. Building on our work establishing that loss of prolactin receptor (PRLR) signaling in β-cells results in GDM, we recently identified novel PRLR differentially expressed genes (PRLR-DEGs) and key transcriptional regulators of PRLR-DEG expression. The objective of this grant is to precisely define how PRLR regulates β-cell gene expression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. We propose the central hypothesis that PRLR signaling orchestrates an anticipatory transcriptional program of β-cell mass expansion during gestation and survival of adequate β-cell mass during postpartum regression. We will test this hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: (1) elucidate transcriptional mechanisms regulating PRLR-DEGs within β-cells during pregnancy. To do so, we will use ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq to examine how PRLR-DEGs are regulated in mouse and human islets during pregnancy or in response to prolactin stimulation. In Aim (2) we will define PRLR signaling-dependent and -independent β-cell subpopulations during pregnancy using single-cell RNA sequencing, lineage tracing and colocalization studies. For Aim (3) we will identify mechanisms of β-cell survival during β-cell mass regression in the early postpartum period through pulse-chase labeling and lineage tracing of β-cells that proliferated during pregnancy, as well as examine how inducible loss of PRLR specifically within the postpartum period affects β-cell mass. Together, results from these studies will reveal transcriptional mechanisms downstream of PRLR and illuminate unique aspects of gestational proliferation (Aim 1), define β-cell subpopulations spatially and temporally across pregnancy (Aim 2), and establish a new role for PRLR signaling in regulation of β-cells postpartum (Aim 3). Our research is significant because these findings would clarify mechanisms of gestational β-cell adaptation and expand our understanding of how PRLR activation regulates transcription. At a fundamental level, these studies will expand our understanding of the mechanisms regulating dynamic changes in β-cell mass, which may identify novel strategies to promote β-cell expansion for therapeutic purposes."
10811780,"In pancreatic islet β cells, insulin granules (IG) are formed at the Golgi complex deep inside the cytoplasm. They need to be actively transported from the site of production to underneath the plasma membrane for regulated secretion. It was previously assumed that MT-dependent transport directionally delivers IGs to the cell periphery along the straight microtubule (MT) tracks, predicting a positive role of MTs in insulin secretion. However, our data over the previous grant cycle show that MT-dependent transport restricts secretion of pre-existing IGs, which are normally present in excessive numbers. We have also found that this negative regulatory function was ascribed to the unique configuration of β-cell MTs. In many other secretory cells, MTs are assembled from the
centrosome and organized as radial tracks that allow directional cargo movement. In contrast, most β-cell MTs are nucleated at the Golgi (Golgi-derived MTs, GDMTs) and are organized as a dense, non-directional meshwork in the cell interior, with addition of stable sub-membrane MT bundles at the cell periphery. Experimental tests and mathematical modeling indicate that this configuration leads to trapping of IGs within the cytoplasm, storing them for sustainable insulin release during long-term β-cell function to avoid insulin-insufficiency-induced diabetes. This function also prevents insulin over-secretion at each stimulus to avoid hyperinsulinemia-induced hypoglycemia. Importantly, we show that glucose stimulus triggers reconfiguration of the MT networks: it induces new GDMT nucleation via the cAMP/EPAC2-mediated signals, which is essential for new IG biosynthesis. It also induces MT disassembly in β-cell periphery to enhance insulin secretion by phosphorylating tau, a well-established microtubule associated protein (MAP). However, a big part of intracellular mechanisms that are responsible for β-cell MT organization and its action  downstream of glucose remains elusive. Intriguingly, our preliminary data suggest that glucose-induced MT remodeling depends on the islet microenvironment. In this proposal, we will test a hypothesis that optimal dynamic architecture of the β-cell MT networks, modulated by intracellular molecular machinery and intercellular paracrine signals, is essential for β-cell function and glucose homeostasis. By addressing our Specific Aims, we will: (1) investigate building and regulating the unique MT networks in β cells, (2) determine MT-dependent regulation of IG transport and positioning in β cells, and (3) determine roles of MTs in paracrine α-β cell communication in islets."

How genomic variation influences cellular function is a fundamental problem with tremendous importance for
human disease. While it has traditionally been difficult to study the effects of specific sequence variants in an
experimentally controlled manner, precise genome editing technologies such as CRISPR base editing enable
“writing” of trait-associated variants to cells to unravel their function. In this proposal, we will perform multi-modal
genome editing-based functional characterization of a total of 72,000 genomic variants associated with
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and hematological traits. CVD and blood traits are uniquely suited to functional
dissection because cardiovascular (coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia) and blood traits
have among the best-powered multi-ethnic GWAS of any traits, and a substantial component of trait variability
can be captured in cellular assays that can be scaled to perform high-throughput screening.
We have assembled an interdisciplinary team of world-class experts to provide a generalizable pipeline to
unravel the functional impact of CVD and blood trait variants by integrating: (1) rich and ancestry-diverse human
genetic discoveries, (2) broadly targetable CRISPR base editors and efficient delivery to primary human cells,
(3) high-content assays to profile phenotypes at the levels of chromatin, gene expression and cellular function,
and (4) computational methods to design, interpret, visualize, and share experimental results.
In Aim 1, we will employ a robust, three-tiered variant prioritization scheme that incorporates evidence for disease
association from large, multi-ethnic GWAS as well as probability of causality to nominate variants for functional
assessment. Through this scheme, we will select variants associated with red blood cell and neutrophil traits,
coronary artery disease, blood pressure, and HDL and LDL cholesterol that span a range of allelic frequencies
and likely causality to test in high-throughput cellular assays.
In Aim 2, we will perform systematic cellular phenotype-based screens using base editors to install candidate
variants as well as CRISPR epigenetic inhibition and activation to explore variant-containing regulatory elements.
We will use eight established, scalable cellular phenotypic readouts, each of which will enable us to assess
which of 12,000 variants and variant-centered elements alter CVD and blood trait-associated cellular
phenotypes. We will additionally employ a high-throughput, genome-integrated chromatin accessibility assay to
assess which variants alter chromatin accessibility in trait-relevant cell lines. We will follow up with targeted single
cell RNA-seq of 5,600 variants in primary cells from donors of different sex and ethnicity.
In Aim 3, we will produce a catalog of validated variants and their association with phenotypes for each of the
proposed screens. We will collaborate with other IGVF groups to utilize these data to optimize models that predict
functional variants, regulatory elements and disease-causing biological mechanisms, ultimately leading to more
complete understanding of the genetic underpinnings of cardiovascular and blood disease risk."

R-level funding. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Mick Couper a research professor at the Institute of Social
Research at UM who is an expert in design and implementation of longitudinal surveys.
Aims: Using both prospective and retrospective surveys and secondary data, she will 1) Determine the
accuracy of physicians to prognosticate new late-onset shock and acute hypoxic respiratory failure; 2) Develop
hypotheses about sources of prognostication accuracy and inaccuracy by exploring heuristics, cognitive biases
and bioethical principles and values; 3) Determine the extent to which variation in hospital rates of persistent

10818401,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ovarian cancer is a silent killer that strikes with few, if any, symptoms. By the time a woman knows she has it,
the cancer is often advanced and the outlook grim. However, if epithelial ovarian cancer is caught early the
prognosis for the patient is excellent. Developing non-invasive and highly specific blood-based tests for pre-
symptomatic screening and early detection of ovarian cancer is therefore crucial. This is especially essential
since obtaining a biopsy is difficult, costly, and sometimes not even an option. In addition, most blood biomarkers
to date lack the necessary sensitivity and specificity for early detection of this silent killer. A fundamental
challenge is the extremely low concentrations of circulating biomolecules released from the developing tumors
at pre-clinical stages which can be 10,000-fold lower than their clinically detectable levels. Therefore, there is a
pressing need to uncover novel biomarkers, apply new strategies, and develop robust technologies to propel the
advancement of cancer diagnostics, especially in a disease such as ovarian cancer. We have focused our efforts
on small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), primarily small and large exosomes derived from the endolysosomal
pathway, which play important roles in cellular communication, immune response, and cancer progression via
transfer of a selective repertoire of biomolecules. sEVs/exosome release is significantly increased in most
neoplastic cells, including ovarian cancer and occurs continuously at all stages of tumor development. Tumor-
derived sEVs accumulate in human blood and malignant effusions. These vesicles carry enriched subsets of
biomolecules mirroring the tumor cells of origin, such as signaling proteins, tumor antigens, and functional RNAs
(mRNA and miRNAs), which offer a new strategy to surmount the challenge in reliable detection of intrinsically
low-level serum markers during early malignant transformation. Thus, the constitutive release and enrichment
of certain tumor markers within sEVs present distinctive opportunities for early cancer diagnosis. We
hypothesize that circulating sEVs, much akin to circulating tumor cells but more robust due to their active release
and incredible stability in bodily fluids, represent a greater source for the discovery of exo-biomarkers for early
detection, potentially while still confined to the fallopian tube. In addition, sEVs can serve as a 'liquid biopsy’ to
assess benefits and treatment responses in real time in cancer patients. Our innovative application merges EV
biology with nano-material/microfluidic technology to develop an advanced microfluidic platform to capture and
detect ovarian cancer-derived sEVs with high specificity and sensitivity from the circulation. This approach will
integrate validated fallopian tube and ovarian cancer associated exo-protein biomarkers (SA1), which will be
applied to a second-generation nano-engineered EV analysis chip (SA2). These studies will be followed by
clinical validation using longitudinal samples collected from asymptomatic women who later develop epithelial
ovarian cancer (SA3). Our ultimate goal is to develop a reliable blood-based assay that, when used in
conjunction with current screening approaches will decrease the mortality from ovarian cancer."
10821348,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
Adolescence is an “age of risk” for the emergence of 1st onset of major depressive disorder (MD). Despite its
prevalence and public health significance, major unanswered questions exist regarding the mechanisms
involved in vulnerability to MD. Depression (Dep) is associated with a reduced sensitivity to rewards and low
reward-related brain function in cortico-striatal circuitry. However, research has not yet tested whether
chronically low reward responsivity (RR) or attenuated RR development during adolescence predicts 1st onset
of MD. A separate literature documents elevated peripheral inflammation in Dep. Yet, research also has not
examined whether chronically elevated inflammation or increases in inflammation during adolescence predicts
1st onset of MD. Further, research on inflammation and RR mostly has proceeded in parallel. Recently,
however, we and others have proposed neuroimmune network models of Dep. These models draw on work
indicating that peripheral inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines) access the brain, where they lower RR.
When dysregulated, this immune-to-brain signaling can lead to chronic and worsening low RR, which is
reflected in dysphoria and anhedonia. This low RR is proposed to initiate unhealthy behaviors (substance use,
poor diet), as well as sleep disruption and stress generation, which further heighten inflammation. Over time,
dysregulation in RR and immune signaling may synergize in a positive feedback loop, whereby dysregulation
in each system exacerbates dysregulation in the other. We propose that reward-immune dysregulation is a
two-hit vulnerability for the 1st onset of MD and increases in Dep symptoms (Sxs) during adolescence.
Moreover, childhood and adolescent adversity and recent stressors influence both RR and inflammation, and
may set the foundation for reward-immune dysregulation. This proposal is the first systematic test of these
hypotheses. We will use an innovative biobehavioral high-risk design to examine bidirectional relationships
between peripheral inflammation and multiple indices and domains (monetary, social) of RR and their joint
prediction of 1st onset of MD and increases in Dep Sxs, particularly anhedonia. Three hundred 14-15 year old
participants (Ps) will complete a prospective 3-year longitudinal study. Ps with no prior MD will be selected
along the entire dimension of self-reported RR, with oversampling at the low tail of the dimension in order to
increase the likelihood of MD onsets. At Time 1 (T1), T3, and T5, each a year apart, Ps will complete blood
draws to quantify inflammation, self-report and behavioral measures of RR, and fMRI scans of reward neural
activity and functional connectivity. At T1-T5 (with T2 and T4 6 mo. between the yearly sessions), Ps also will
complete diagnostic interviews, and measures of Dep Sxs, reward-relevant life events, and behaviors that
increase inflammation. Adversity history will be assessed at T1 only. This proposal is an innovative integration
of research on reward and inflammatory signaling in understanding 1st onset of MD in adolescence. It has the
potential to facilitate novel neuroimmune and behavioral interventions to treat, and ideally prevent, MD."

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a newly described immune-mediated disease and a leading cause of
esophageal morbidity in children and young adults. Histologically, pediatric EoE is characterized by esophageal
basal cell hyperplasia (BCH) and extensive Th2-associated inflammation. Despite many advances in our
understanding of the pathophysiology of EoE, the molecular mechanisms leading to the development of BCH in
pediatric EoE remain to be elucidated. The proposed training in this mentored career development award
outlines a five-year integrated program of mentored research and career development activities to support Dr.
Dominique Bailey's development into an independent physician-scientist. This comprehensive program will build
on Dr. Bailey's experience as pediatric gastroenterologist and her background in developmental biology by
enabling her to develop new skills and advanced expertise in 3D organoid culture systems, flow cytometry,
epithelial stem cell biology, and immunology through formal coursework and implementation of a thoughtfully
designed research plan. Specifically, her research proposal aims to utilize innovative approaches to explore the
molecular mechanisms underlying BCH in pediatric EoE.
Using a novel conditional IL-13 overexpression mouse model of early onset EoE, we have been able to study
Th2-driven BCH. Our preliminary data demonstrate increased levels of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) in the
nuclei of hyperplasic esophageal basal cells in these mice and pediatric EoE patient biopsies. However, the role
of YAP in EoE pathogenesis has not been clearly investigated. Based on these findings, the overall hypothesis
is that YAP mediates IL-13-induced BCH during the pathogenesis of EoE. In Aim 1, we will use YAP loss- and
gain-of function mouse models to test the hypothesis that YAP activation promotes BCH. In Aim 2, using in vivo
and in vitro assays, we will elucidate the signaling pathway through which IL-13 directly modulates the
transcription of YAP, thereby resulting in BCH. In Aim 3, we will begin to translate findings to pediatric EoE
patients to directly assess the YAP expression in pediatric EoE biopsies and test whether YAP inhibition blocks
BCH in organoids. Overall, findings from the proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of
the pathophysiology of pediatric EoE and provide new insights into potential biomarkers and novel therapeutic
targets for pediatric EoE. Dr. Bailey's mentors and Advisory Committee, comprised of a multidisciplinary team of
experts in field of GI epithelial biology, immunology and eosinophilic diseases, will guide her through the research
and training goals outlined in her proposal and establish the foundation for a future R01 application. Collectively,

momentum of prior cycles by: (1) nurturing successful research programs at the INBRE partner
PUI/CC that respect and respond to specific institutional culture, identity and mission; (2)
implementing an effective, progressive suite of intramural granting mechanisms that not only
support PUI and CC investigators, but engage them in a competitive peer-reviewed and
meritorious awarding process; (3) strategically supporting promising, talented Junior
Investigators (JIs) to build human capital and increase the technical sophistication for
establishing deeply rooted research at INBRE partner PUI/CC. The strengths of the current
INBRE IV cycle include the level of integration of DRPP investigators with priority INBRE
activities such as undergraduate research and the program’s ongoing support of core facilities
that enhance research sophistication at the PUI/CC through brokered access to cores at the

Understanding the mechanism(s) by which cocaine, methamphetamine, cannabis, and opioids
amplify the damage of HIV latency is a central goal of the CWRU Center for Excellence on the
Impact of Substance Use on HIV. Our understanding of HIV latency and persistence has been
complicated by the small numbers of latently infected cells found in the circulation, the difficulty
of obtaining comprehensive sets of tissue samples from patients, the lack of known phenotypic
markers that can distinguish latently infected cells from uninfected ones, and limited information
about the behavior of tissue reservoirs in vivo. Core B will provide both ex vivo primary cell models
(Aim 1) and highly sensitive nucleic acid-based assays to measure the impact of substance use
on the HIV reservoir (Aim 2) in clinical samples. A key unresolved issue is how each individual
drug modulates the latent HIV reservoir in multiple cell types and tissues. The Primary Cell,
Biomimetic, and iPSC-derived Cell Models Core B team will provide and develop for Center
investigators innovative and highly informative cellular and biomimetic models for the three main
organ targets of drug use and HIV – the brain, gut, and the immune system. Organoids derived
from tissue explants and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) will be used to mimic the tissue
microenvironment and extend the range of assays beyond what can be achieved using single cell
ex vivo models. The models offered by Core B will be used throughout the Center of Excellence
to evaluate the impact of drug use on HIV latency and will also be established ex vivo with samples
derived from persons with Substance Use Disorder and HIV on anti-retroviral therapy. These
models will each reflect the diversity of molecular mechanisms governing the response to drug
use and HIV latency in CD4 T cells from the periphery, mucosal T cells from the gut, and
microglial, neuronal, and microvascular endothelial cells from the CNS and will also provide
unique opportunities to contrast the effects of substance use in vivo with direct cell biological
analyses ex vivo. Importantly, the Core B team will continue to develop new assays and methods
to study the impact of substance use on the mechanisms of HIV persistence and latency. In
particular, this effort includes (a) developing single cell RNA induction assays, (b) modeling the
TFH compartment, and (c) advancing iPSC-derived cerebral organoids to study drug use and HIV
latency in the CNS. Thus, Core B, in collaboration with the molecular services in Core C, will
provide access to novel technologies for evaluating the cellular, proteomic, microbiological,

mechanisms that govern the integrity of the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system,
gastrointestinal (GI) function, and neurocognitive disease in the context of HIV persistence. Such
studies have led to conflicting results largely because of the complexity of these systems and the
low resolution of assays aimed at measuring the different arms, cells, and functions. The lack of
assays that can provide an accurate assessment of substance use is also at the source of these
conflicting results that have attempted to associate mechanisms downstream of substance use.
on HIV disease severity. To address these issues, and in support of the NIDA funded projects
at CWRU and nationwide, the CWRU Center for Excellence on the Impact of Substance Use on
HIV will rely on the Computational Biology in Substance Use Research Support Core C.
This core is a comprehensive shared resource that provides advanced transcriptomics,
genomics, functional microbiome, metabolomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, and computational
biology resources to Center investigators. This shared resource leverages multiple technologies
under the direction of Drs. Mark Chance, Adam Burgener, Saba Valadkhan, and Konstantin
Leskov that provide that provide advanced computational and experimental platforms to serve
the Substance Use program and the Center’s investigators. Core C will provide a centralized
data management and analysis resource to all Center investigators making the navigation of the
‘omics’ landscape seamless and driving appropriate choices of a wide array of ‘omics’
technologies for specific experimental designs. It will be focused on ‘omics’ data acquisition and
storage (Aim 1), training and data analysis (Aim 2), and data integration, biomarker validation,
and modeling of these datasets (Aim 3). The deliverables of Core C will be an iterative database
of all experimental datasets, including protocols and sample identifiers (Aim 1), state of the art
analysis of all datasets stemming from all ‘omics’ platforms as well as assays that can provide
quantitative assessment of drug levels (Aim 2). Aim 3 will focus on integrating and performing
meta-analysis of all datasets across all cohorts and physiological systems to define
generalizable and distinct mechanisms that underlie the impact of cocaine, methamphetamine,
opioids, and cannabis on HIV latency, neurocognitive dysfunction, constipation, intestinal
permeability, damage to the blood brain barrier, and loss of immune homeostasis and function.
This integrated approach will identify predictors of HIV disease progression specific to single and
poly-users of each drug for each organ system, which could lead to the development of
therapeutic approaches tailored to correct the GI, neurological, and immunological pathologies
in persons with drug use and HIV."
10851967,"Project Summary Core D – Clinical and Behavioral Services Core
The Clinical and Behavioral Services Core D furthers the scientific mission of the Case
Western Reserve University Center for Excellence on the Impact of Substance Use on
HIV by providing a uniform, broadly available resource to gain access to subjects, specimens,
and collected data for basic, translational, clinical, epidemiological, behavioral, and psychosocial
studies of HIV disease. Currently, the Core has a searchable registry with longitudinal history of
virtually all HIV-infected patients followed in the MetroHealth System (MHS) ID clinic, the largest
HIV provider in Northeast Ohio, and will establish a biorepository linked to this clinical data.
Core D will enable investigators to conduct studies that require access to populations that are
typically difficult to reach, recruit, and retain. The Database will leverage the robust electronic
health record (EHR) that has been in place since 1999 at MHS. The EHR has embedded search
tools to (i) enable population health research, (ii) identify subjects for research and registries,
(iii) track populations, and (iv) retrieve extensive clinical information with data extending back to
1999. The Specimen Repository will be linked to the Database and offers researchers ready
access to stored samples complete with comprehensive, longitudinal, clinical, patient reported
outcomes, behavioral, and laboratory data. Core D will leverage existing studies of patients who
use illicit substances to develop a comprehensive database and specimen repository of persons
with substance use disorder and HIV and then expand to include HIV-negative at-risk for HIV
substance using individuals. The linked repository will include a robust expansive program for
longitudinal semi-annual collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, plasma, serum, stool,
rectal swabs, vaginal swabs, and urine. The repository will also collect and store tonsillar tissue,
CSF, and colonic biopsies. Participants will receive client centered assistance to treat addiction
from staff trained to use motivational interviewing. Core D will integrate public and mental health
activities in Northeast Ohio regarding persons with HIV and Substance Use Disorder through
clinical and community outreach with our neighboring public and mental health organizations,
that include urban (Cleveland), suburban (Cuyahoga), and suburban/rural (Lorain) populations.
Finally, Core D leadership will assist investigators in formulating research questions that take
full advantage of the clinical Database and specimen Repository, while avoiding pitfalls and
potential biases that result from incomplete understanding of the data structure, patient-related
data, and patient characteristics."
10766257,"Project Summary
 The rising rates of obesity worldwide contribute directly to an increased prevalence of chronic kidney
disease. With current methods for mitigating obesity related kidney injury incompletely effective, novel
approaches to this problem are needed. In renal lipotoxicity, toxic lipid metabolites accumulate in certain
kidney cell types, including proximal tubule cells. This has recently been identified as an important mechanism
behind obesity related kidney disease but is also not well understood.
 In obesity, greater proximal tubule uptake of lipid occurs through increased luminal endocytosis of fatty
acid bound to albumin, facilitated by interaction of the vacuolar H+ -ATPase and mTOR with the
megalin/cubulin complex. At the same time, decreased activation of renal AMPK in obesity leads to decreased
fatty acid oxidation through inactivation of PGC-1α, and CPT1A, further resulting in intracellular lipid
accumulation in the proximal tubule. ATP6AP2 is an integral component of the vacuolar H+ -ATPase and has
also been shown to have a role in intracellular energy signaling including inhibition of AMPK and PGC-1α as
well as activation of mTOR in diabetes. Renal cortical ATP6AP2 expression increases in obesity but its role in
lipotoxicity is unknown. Mice with nephron specific ATP6AP2 knockout during obesity have increased urinary
excretion of albumin and fatty acid, reduced proximal tubule lipid content during diet induced obesity,
decreased endoplasmic reticulum stress, a marker of lipotoxicity, and altered intrarenal lipid profile. This
proposal will test the hypothesis that in obesity ATP6AP2 promotes proximal tubule lipotoxicity through
endocytosis of albumin bound fatty acid as well as reduced intracellular fatty acid oxidation. Aim 1 proposes
that ATP6AP2 increases fatty acid endocytosis through the H+ -ATPase/mTOR/megalin/cubulin. Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that ATP6AP2 reduces fatty acid oxidation through AMPK/PGC-1α/CPT1A..
 This project will also greatly facilitate my career development toward the goal of becoming a fully
independent physician scientist performing basic and translational research. The career development plan
described in this application will include formal training in lipid science and lipidomics, the use of transgenic
mouse models, microscopy, and scientific writing, as well as mentorship by leaders in endocrinology and lipid
science including my mentors Drs. Helmy Siragy and Thurl Harris. This will take place at the University of
Virginia, an excellent research training environment with state-of-the art research facilities and core
laboratories as well as a superb academic environment for early career scientists. Data generated by the
proposed studies will establish the basis for an independent research career, distinct from my mentors."

 The goal of Dr. Neha Goel’s K23 project is to enable her to become an independent physician-investigator who
conducts research on the implementation of evidence-based care for patients with acute respiratory failure.
Building upon her strengths as a pulmonary-critical care physician and her prior training in clinical emergency
care research, Dr. Goel will transition into the next phase of her career through a well-defined training plan. The
training plan is meticulously designed to enable her to acquire requisite skills in guideline development,
implementation science methodology, and advanced statistical analyses. Her career development plan contains
focused training through conduct of a mentored research study, relevant didactic coursework, and close
mentorship from leaders in the fields of emergency and critical care medicine, and implementation science.
 Dr. Goel’s ultimate research objective is to improve clinical outcomes for patients with acute respiratory failure
through the implementation of a systematically developed, evidence-based, high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO)
monitoring protocol for the emergency department (ED). In keeping with this objective, her K23 mentored
research project will focus on investigating the implementation of evidence-based protocol on HFNO use and
management for The Mount Sinai Hospital ED. HFNO use and management is a timely and important research
topic. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, there has been a rapid increase in HFNO usage. However,
guidance on HFNO use and monitoring in the ED setting is lacking, and adverse clinical outcomes occur in the
absence of guidance. Dr. Goel’s K23 research project specific aims are to: (Aim 1) develop a pragmatic protocol
for HFNO use and management in ED setting for hypoxemic acute respiratory failure using feedback from a
national panel of multi-disciplinary experts and current evidence; (Aim 2) select implementation strategies that
address the determinants of protocol-concordant HFNO use and management, commensurate with the ED’s
capabilities, resources, and needs of its patients; and (Aim 3) examine both the implementation process for the
HFNO protocol and the applicable clinical outcomes in a pilot hybrid effectiveness-implementation study. The
completed project will include an implementation plan for HFNO management in the ED setting, and will provide
estimates of effect and sample sizes for a future R01 implementing and testing the impact of HFNO monitoring
protocols across health systems. Using the skills and preliminary data gained throughout this K23 mentored
career development project, Dr. Goel will be well positioned to become an independent physician-scientist with
R01 funding to implement and test the effectiveness of respiratory care protocols for improving patient and
process outcomes across health systems. Larger scale implementation of such interventions can help
standardized care delivery, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes for more than a million acutely
ill patients presenting to EDs annually in the United States with respiratory complaints."

Obesity is clearly detrimental in asthma, yet we lack tools to treat the unique obese asthma phenotype.
Comorbid obesity impacts >40% of adult asthmatics1 and increases asthma severity, symptoms and
exacerbations while simultaneously reducing the efficacy of conventional therapies.2-5 Our long-term goal is to
develop novel treatments for airway inflammation in the obese asthma phenotype. Our overall objective, which
is the next step in translating our preclinical and preliminary clinical findings, is to determine the impact of
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) on asthma control and airway and adipose inflammation
in adults with obese asthma. Our central hypothesis is that GLP-1RA improve asthma control and reduce
airway inflammation due to direct effects on the respiratory tract in obese asthma. To generate the proof-of-
concept data to support definitive phase 3 clinical trials of GLP-1RA in the obese asthma phenotype and test
our central hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the efficacy of GLP-1RA on
asthma control and assess tolerability in obese asthma and 2) Determine the tissue-specific impact of GLP-
1RA on inflammation in the airway and adipose in obese asthma. In a 12-week double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled trial of oral semaglutide 7 mg once daily in adult subjects with obesity-related, symptomatic
asthma without DMII, we will test the hypotheses that semaglutide improves asthma control (aim 1a), is
tolerated (aim 1b) and reduces type-2 and non-type 2 airway inflammation independent of weight loss (aim 2).
The primary clinical outcome will be change from baseline in ACQ-7. The primary mechanistic outcome will be
change from baseline in serum periostin. Because insulin resistance is variable in obesity and baseline blood
eosinophil counts are often predictive of response to asthma therapeutics, these markers will be used for
prespecified subgroup analyses. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose and respiratory tract samples at baseline
and 5 and 12 weeks of therapy will be compared using RNA sequencing to test the hypothesis that GLP-1RA
reduce inflammation to restore homeostasis in the respiratory tract opposite to changes in adipose tissue in
obese asthma. This proposal facilitates the collection of the necessary clinical, mechanistic, and tolerability
data to inform the design of a definitive phase III clinical trial of a GLP-1RA in asthma. It thereby supports the
rapid development of a novel therapeutic class for asthma and represents a paradigm shift in the approach to
therapeutic intervention in asthma through the targeting of a metabolic pathway which regulates upstream
inflammation across multiple organ systems, may be disease modifying, and ultimately glucocorticoid sparing."
10833708,"Developing and Testing Health Warnings for ENDS
PROJECT SUMMARY
The use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS or e-cigarettes) has reached epidemic levels among
young people in the United States (US). ENDS emit toxic substances, including nicotine that irreversibly affects
youth’s developing brain leading to dependence and increased risk of cigarette smoking initiation, yet
misperceptions about their safety are widespread. Therefore, health communication of ENDS-related risks
through Health Warning Labels (HWLs) has been considered as a priority by leading health and regulatory
bodies in the US to reduce ENDS use among young people. We have developed and pilot-tested a clinical lab
model to examine the potential effects of pictorial HWLs on young (21-29 yrs) ENDS users’ experiences. In this
proposal, we will use this model coupled with a systematic development of ENDS pictorial HWLs to test their
effect when they are placed on the device on a variety of subjective (e.g. satisfaction, harm perception, nicotine
dependence, intention to quit) and objective outcomes (e.g. plasma nicotine, puff topography). This will be
done in three stages. First, we will review the literature and develop candidate messages and their associated
pictures for the HWLs (n=45). This initial set of HWLs will then be revised and ranked through a Delphi study
among tobacco control, regulation, and health communication experts. Second, we will conduct focus groups
with young ENDS (21-29 yrs) users to adapt the candidate HWLs to our target population and device itself.
Third, we will test HWLs on the ENDS device in a clinical lab cross-over study, where each subject uses ENDS
in 2 sessions; 1) their preferred product without HWL (control), and 2) their preferred product with pictorial
HWL on the ENDS device. This design will allow us to test our main hypothesis; compared to control, using
ENDS with the HWLs is associated with decreased satisfaction, dependence suppression, and puffing
behavior, but increased knowledge about harm and intention to quit. This project will guide policymakers into
the application of effective HWLs for ENDS and will develop warning messages and pictorials that national and
state stakeholders can use through different modalities in counter-marketing campaigns to protect young
people and discourage harmful ENDS use."
10825549,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria identified critical research needs to
confront the advancing threat of antimicrobial resistance. These include understanding the nature of microbial
communities, determining the effects of antibiotics on these communities, and harnessing these communities to
develop strategies for disease prevention. Staphylococcus aureus causes significant morbidity and mortality in
healthcare and community settings. S. aureus carriage confers risk for endogenous infection. Previous studies
investigated clinical and epidemiological factors associated with S. aureus colonization and infection, although
the influence of the skin and nasal microbiota on S. aureus acquisition is unclear. We hypothesize that features
of the commensal microbiota may confer susceptibility to, or provide protection against, S. aureus acquisition
and development of subsequent infection. Further, in an effort to prevent S. aureus acquisition and infection,
decolonization with topical antimicrobials is frequently employed in healthcare and community settings. However,
broad-spectrum topical antimicrobial application may disrupt commensal microbiota, thereby promoting the
acquisition or enrichment of multidrug-resistant and/or potentially pathogenic microorganisms. The impact of this
potential adverse effect remains understudied.
 In this proposed project, we will analyze a vast and unmatched biorepository of >13,000 skin and nasal swab
samples that were longitudinally collected over 24 months from a well-characterized cohort of 476 participants,
including 99 pediatric patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus skin infections and their household contacts,
all of whom are at high risk for S. aureus acquisition and infection. The samples were collected during 12 months
of longitudinal samplings (the natural history phase) followed by a randomized, 5-day decolonization intervention
with topical antimicrobial application, and subsequent longitudinal sampling for 12 months (post-decolonization
phase). We will perform metagenomic shotgun sequencing (enabling classification at the species and strain
levels), to longitudinally characterize skin and nasal microbial communities in the context of S. aureus
colonization and disease. We will compare microbial community features associated with susceptibility or
resistance to S. aureus acquisition between household contacts with different phenotypic outcomes (e.g.,
colonization and infection), and integrate these data with detailed epidemiological data to predict individuals at
risk for acquiring S. aureus colonization and/or developing symptomatic infection. We will quantify changes in
microbial community structures following topical antimicrobial application, and correlate this disruption with
subsequent acquisition and persistence of S. aureus and other pathogens. Finally, we will employ innovative
targeted sequence capture to quantify genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance (the “resistome”) in
samples collected before and after decolonization. The essential knowledge generated by this study will optimize
preventive strategies for S. aureus colonization and infection and their targeting to susceptible individuals."
10813002,"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a devastating systemic disorder
characterized by progressive development and enlargement of bilateral renal cysts leading to renal failure.
Disease severity and progression vary widely among patients. Large phenotypic variability, incomplete
understanding of underlying mechanisms, and lack of satisfactory biomarkers challenge the identification,
implementation and evaluation of potential therapies. In ADPKD, endothelial dysfunction (ED), characterized
by an imbalance between vasodilating (particularly nitric oxide, NO) and vasoconstricting substances, develops
early on and correlates with renal disease severity. We propose that preservation of endothelial function will
ameliorate renal disease severity and progression. Increased homocysteine has been reported in patients with
ADPKD even in those with preserved kidney function. Homocysteine decreases NO availability. However, the
mechanisms underlying increased homocysteine in ADPKD are not known. Elevations in homocysteine reflect
changes in its metabolism, which can be modulated by NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4). In line with this, we found
upregulation of NOX4, and increased homocysteine, in Pkd1RC/RC mice with early disease. Pharmacologic
reduction of NOX4 restored homocysteine metabolism and reduced cystic burden. Betaine, known to decrease
plasma homocysteine, preserved capillary index, and reduced cystic burden of Pkd1RC/RC mice. Systemic
endothelial function inversely correlated with urine NOX4, plasma homocysteine and renal disease severity by
kidney volume in young normotensive patients with ADPKD. However, whether upregulation of NOX4 redirect
homocysteine metabolism leading to decreased NO availability and ED, and the extent to which ED and
microvascular abnormalities contribute to renal disease severity remain unknown. Similarly, whether markers
of ROS, endothelial function and injury, or levels of homocysteine can predict disease severity and progression
in patients is not known. Our central hypothesis is that early upregulation of NOX4 redirects
homocysteine metabolism leading to its accumulation, which in turn decreases NO availability leading
to ED and microvascular damage, which contributes to ADPKD severity and progression. Three specific
aims will be pursued: Aim 1: will test whether early upregulation in NOX4 redirects homocysteine metabolism
leading to its accumulation in ADPKD. Aim 2: will test whether accumulation of homocysteine decreases NO
availability leading to ED, and whether ED leads to microvascular damage and contributes to disease severity
and progression. Aim 3: will determine the prognostic value of markers of ROS, endothelial function and injury,
and levels of homocysteine to assess disease severity and progression in patients with early ADPKD.
Successful studies will reveal the contribution of microvascular damage to the severity and progression of
ADPKD, and will provide critical biological, preclinical evidence, and rationale to justify clinical trials targeting
homocysteine metabolism for this disease."
10880516,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Training of healthcare providers in the reproductive and sexual health (RSH) needs of persons with disabilities
(PWD) is critical to addressing a broad array of RSH concerns. Rigorous trials evaluating the effects of
curricula on provider behavior are rare. Specifically, we could find no formalized training of healthcare
providers in RSH for PWD in sub-Saharan Africa, an environment with the highest rates of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), sexually transmitted infection (STI), and unintended pregnancy in the world; and
where RSH challenges are common and particularly dire for PWD. Reproductive healthcare is a sensitive issue
in Africa and PWD are often excluded from consideration. Consequently, a rigorous study of PWD RSH
education for healthcare providers is needed if such education is to be widely adopted. Currently, at Muhimbili
University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) in Dar es Salaam, we are conducting a rigorous randomized
controlled trial (RCT) of an Afrocentric RSH curriculum training for healthcare providers which was partly
adapted from PAHO/WHO for implementation in Tanzania. When we assessed the need for training in RSH
needs of PWD in our participants in this trial, nursing, midwifery, and medical students indicated RSH
curriculum for PWD to be highly acceptable, needed, and desired by students, and our current NIH-funded
RCT has clearly indicated the feasibility of implementation. The next logical step is to create a culturally
relevant RSH curriculum to improve student knowledge, attitudes, and skills in providing RSH care for PWD.
There are three specific aims. Aim 1 is to conduct a social ecological needs assessment of RSH care delivery
for PWD in Tanzania. To determine the most important content when accessing RSH care, we will interview
~20 PWD and ~20 PWD caregivers (total of ~40 interviews) on their experience accessing RSH care. To
determine the needs from the perspective of the healthcare workers, we will conduct focus groups of
midwifery, nursing, and medical students (3 from each discipline). We will also conduct individual interviews
with 12 key informants. In Aim 2, we will further adapt our curriculum, ensure it is culturally tailored to the
Tanzanian/sub-Saharan context, and pilot test it. Aim 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of an Afrocentric,
culturally appropriate RSH curriculum for health providers focused on caring for PWD. We will conduct a
randomized, controlled, single blinded trial of the curriculum against a waitlist control assessing effects on RSH
for PWD knowledge, attitudes, and counseling skills (n=206 students per arm; 412 in total). Hypotheses will
test efficacy of the curriculum. We will consult an advisory board of PWD in Tanzania to address structural and
cultural issues throughout and use Universal Design (UD)/Universal Design for Learning (UDL) consultant for
all study materials. If effective, MUHAS has committed to implement the curriculum for all health students.
Given MUHAS is preeminent in health student education across Africa, the curriculum assessed in this study
has high potential to be widely adopted as a new standard of training for health professionals across Africa."
10854723,"Background and Significance:
 Following hospital discharge, risk of depression is significantly increased in cardio-vascular disease
(CVD) patients. Moreover, CVD patients with depression face reduced functioning, increased morbidity and
mortality, and diminished quality of life. Unfortunately, most depressed CVD patients do not receive
appropriate evidence-based care for their depression, often because they are unable to, or fearful of travelling
to providers for the regimen of 8-12 weekly visits of evidence-based psychotherapy such as Behavioral
Activation (BA). Our group developed, evaluated and subsequently implemented in VA clinics, the first VA
program to use home based telehealth to deliver BA for depression to elderly Veterans. We now propose to
evaluate the ability of this evidence based treatment and delivery model (BA for depression via home-
telehealth) to reduce functional impairment and improve recovery in depressed Veterans who have
experienced a CVD event-related hospitalization.
Research Plan and Specific Aims:
 1. To compare effectiveness of Behavioral Activation for depression delivered via Home-based
Telehealth- to standard post-CVD hospital discharge best-practices care in a 2x4 (treatment by time) repeated
measures RCT crossover design (baseline, post-treatment, 3 & 9-month follow-up; crossover for standard
treatment group at 9 months) with 132 CVD Veteran patients evincing depression in terms of central outcomes
of functioning (PROMIS Functioning and Global Health scales) and emotional symptoms (PROMIS Depression
and Anxiety scales) and secondary objective outcomes related to activity (actigraphy data). At the 9 month
point, the comparison group will have the option of receiving the intervention (thus complementing the RCT
with a crossover phase).
 2. To repeat these comparisons with sex and age as independent variables.
 3. To evaluate BA-HT with respect to its effects on exploratory outcomes, including re-hospitalization.
Hypotheses:
 We predict that evidence-based psychotherapy for depression (i.e., Behavioral Activation) delivered via
home based telehealth will more effectively increase social role and activity functioning, activity, mood and
reduce 6-month re-hospitalization (exploratory hypothesis), compared to current best-practices post-discharge
care among patients scoring at least moderately depressed on the PROMIS Depression scale one week
following hospital discharge for a CVD event.
Impact:
 If effective, this innovative treatment and delivery strategy will enhance global functioning, improve
quality of life, and reduce costs to Veterans and the VA. Importantly, the proposed strategy leverages existing
VA infrastructure and capabilities so that BA-HT could be immediately offered throughout VA as a preventative
measure to enhance resiliency."

Texas State University (TxState) will implement an Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student
Enhancement program (U-RISE Tx) to increase the diversity and number of TxState students entering PhD
programs in biomedical research. We will recruit qualified Hispanic and other underrepresented (UR) students
for extensive undergraduate research experiences in chemistry, biochemistry, and biology and provide these
students with the skills, mentoring, training, and support necessary to excel in graduate school and beyond. U-
RISE Tx will synergize with other successful NSF- and NIH-funded programs at TxState to broadly improve the
training environment through evidence-based training and mentoring methods that will be implemented across
multiple departments. This program will accomplish its goals through the following Specific Aims:
Recruitment: We will employ a robust recruitment strategy that includes Browse Sessions during University
open-house recruitment events for prospective high school seniors (Bobcat Days) and during New Student
Orientation events; STEM-focused sections of the mandatory first-year seminar course US1100 and additional
campus-wide advertising targeting STEM freshmen. Pre-RISE: Bi-weekly seminars for freshmen will provide
information regarding strategies for academic success, career decision making, and careers in the biomedical
sciences. These sessions will include preparation for summer REU programs at one of our partner Tier-1
research institutions and will foster a community to build student self-confidence, social and cultural capital,
and scientific identity. Mentored research: First-year student applicants will be selected to join the U-RISE Tx
program at the end of the Spring semester. U-RISE Tx trainees will participate in required coursework,
structured activities, and independent research projects with program faculty mentors. Throughout the
program, trainees will participate in training for responsible conduct of research, research rigor and
reproducibility, ethics, and laboratory safety. Trainees will participate in at least one summer REU program at
one of our two partner T32-hosting research universities. An innovative aspect of the U-RISE Tx program is its
integration of laboratory automation training, with associated improvements in efficiency and reproducibility,
and training in proper protocols for record-keeping in both traditional and electronic lab notebooks.
Professional development: Faculty research mentors will participate in both local and national workshops
and seminars for mentorship. Trainees will participate in extensive career development activities focused on
transitioning to PhD programs using Individual Development Plans and Research Portfolios. Teamwork, social
interactions, and peer mentoring will develop a strong sense of belonging and science identity of trainees, who
will also have multiple opportunities to present their research within the program and at local and national
meetings. Trainees and their mentors will undergo continual formative evaluation to ensure the quality of the
program aided by an Oversight Committee and an External Advisory Committee."
10836353,"Project Summary/Abstract
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of receptors in the human genome and can signal
through multiple transducers, including heterotrimeric G protein and β-arrestins. Opioid receptors are GPCRs
whose role in pain sensation has made them primary drug targets for pain medications such as oxycodone and
morphine. However, opioids have exceptionally high abuse potential and often cause fatal side effects such as
respiratory arrest and death. The magnitude of these problems has led to a search for opioid alternatives to treat
pain and related conditions. Activation of opioid receptors activates downstream effectors, including multiple G
proteins (Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, GoA, GoB, Gz, and Ggustducin) and β-arrestins (β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2). A major
gap is an incomplete understanding of how opioid receptors recognize different transducers and the functional
effects of signaling through each pathway. Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) has displayed promising therapeutic
potential because of its novel analgesic activity –drugs that target KOR do not lead to addiction or cause death
due to overdose as observed from mu opioid receptor agonists. Selective KOR antagonists have also been
pursued in clinical trials for the treatment of addiction and depression. The research in my lab is driven by the
overall hypothesis that large-scale structural determination studies of receptor-ligand/transducer complexes will
provide molecular-level insights into opioid receptor signaling, and facilitate the design and optimization of novel
ligand scaffolds that could be further developed into new drugs with desired behavior profile. By combining X-
ray crystallography, Cryo-EM, and molecular pharmacology, we will elucidate fundamental mechanisms of KOR
ligand selectivity, receptor activation and signaling. To do so, we will pursue the following main directions: (i)
identify structural determinants of ligand selectivity between different opioid receptors types, (ii) identify the
molecular basis for different G protein subtypes recognition, and (iii) identify structural features responsible for
arrestin-bound activating states. The long-term goal is to develop receptor-specific and pathway-selective probes
using structure-based drug discovery and study the function of individual opioid receptor signaling in vivo."
10868507,"The US is currently experiencing an opioid epidemic with opioid overdose, opioid use disorder (OUD) and
Emergency Department (ED) visits related to opioids on the rise. The ED is at the forefront of this public health
emergency and often a place where patients with OUD come for treatment of medical problems, both related
and unrelated to opioid use. Medications for OUD (MOUD) and linkage to care from the ED are a critical piece
in addressing this crisis. Patients in the ED with OUD present with a complex constellation of substance use,
psychiatric and medical comorbidity, and often experience fragmented healthcare delivery. Comprehensive
disease management strategies, such as the Collaborative Care model, hold great promise for addressing the
treatment needs of patients with OUD in the ED. The Emergency Department Longitudinal Integrated Care
(ED-LINC) intervention derives from the Collaborative Care model and is a multi-component, longitudinal
intervention for patients with OUD and related comorbidity that is initiated during an ED visit. The ED-LINC
clinical trial will randomize 500 patients with OUD seeking care at two Washington State EDs to the ED-LINC
intervention (n=250) or usual care control (n=250) conditions. Patients randomized to the ED-LINC intervention
will receive; 1) overdose education; 2) brief bedside intervention targeting motivation to engage in outpatient
care; 3) a patient-centered approach to MOUD using a treatment decision support tool; 4) longitudinal and
proactive care management which will proceed for three months along with weekly caseload supervision of the
interventionist by a mental health professional allowing for stepped-up care targeting opioid use and
associated comorbidity. ED-LINC is supported by the Emergency Department Information Exchange (EDIE)
platform, which is a novel care coordination tool that collects data from hospitals in over 30 states and
packages this information for emergency providers in real-time alert notifications. Further features of EDIE
include creation of tailored care plans. The trial incorporates pragmatic outcome assessment elements,
including the use of EDIE and statewide administrative data to assess important outcomes on the intent-to-
treat sample. The ED-LINC trial tests the hypotheses that over time, patients randomized to the ED-LINC
intervention, when compared to patients randomized to usual care, will demonstrate: 1) significant reductions
in self-report illicit opioid use; 2) significant increases in MOUD initiation and retention, and 3) significant
reductions in ED utilization. Secondary analyses will explore the impact of methamphetamine use comorbidity
and sex on intervention treatment effects. The study team also plans to conduct an implementation process
assessment using novel mixed methods to understand the potential for sustainable implementation of
intervention elements. Data derived from this formative evaluation will be used to prepare for the presentation
of study results at a policy summit in the final year of the trial which will allow for rapid dissemination and
potential policy changes related to care for patients with OUD from the ED."
10934322,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alternative splicing (AS) is a major driver of protein isoform diversity and is regulated in a highly cell
type-specific manner. A better understanding of the cell type-specific splicing code will not only provide novel
insights into the role of alternative splicing in disease and development but will also result in novel genetic tools
for perturbing and interrogating cell types of interest. Synthetic splicing constructs have been successfully used
to target activation of reporter and therapeutic genes to cancer cells carrying mutations in splice factors or to
make gene therapies conditional on a small molecular trigger. Existing examples highlight the potential of AS
as a programmable control mechanism but do not provide a clear path towards engineering splice regulatory
sequences that can be used to target gene expression to any desired cell type or state. Here, we propose to
combine synthetic biology with machine learning to generate highly cell type-specific splicing constructs.
Building on our earlier work, we will first quantify cell type-specific AS using splicing massively parallel reporter
assays (MPRAs). We will focus on exon skipping and intron retention because they are among the most
common forms of AS and can be highly cell type-specific. For each type of AS, we will create libraries with
hundreds of thousands or even millions of reporters with variation targeted to regions of interest. We will then
measure AS for these libraries in a panel of cell lines and cultured primary cells (Specific Aim 1). Next, we will
use these data to train machine learning models that can accurately predict AS isoform abundance from
reporter gene sequence. We will systematically compare different network architectures and approaches
including convolutional and recurrent neural networks. We will then combine models with sequence design
approaches previously developed in the lab to generate synthetic sequences with enhanced target cell
specificity. We aim to show that we can generate reporter constructs that are specific to any cell type in our
panel. We will validate predictions experimentally and use resulting data to iteratively improve model
predictions (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will generalize our approach to an experimental setting that more
accurately reflects the diversity and complexity of cell types encountered in multi-cellular biological systems.
Specifically, we will perform splicing MPRAs in organotypic developing rat brain slice culture. We will optimize
conditions for library delivery to slice culture and we will similarly optimize approaches for reading out splicing
MPRAs at the single cell level. We will combine the resulting data with the generative models from Specific Aim
1 to design reporter constructs that precisely target protein expression to cell types of interest (Specific Aim
3). We believe that this work will result in novel genetic tools for biology research and provide a path towards
gene therapies with increased specificity and reduced side effects."

Approximately 1.2 million individuals in the United States and 38 million worldwide are living with HIV. Priorities
for HIV research include cure, mitigating associated inflammation and immune activation, novel therapeutics,
and optimizing current management. In addition, there remains detrimental interindividual variability in HIV
treatment responses regarding toxicities and immune recovery. Efforts to decipher relationships between the
human genome and responses to therapeutic interventions in people living with HIV will help drive continued
progress in the field, and involve complementary methodologies. The well-established value of the genome-
wide association study (GWAS) is expanded by considering the polygenic risk score (PRS), which considers
numerous polymorphisms that, in combination, affect risk for a phenotype, and by the integrated risk score
(IRS), which combines PRS with non-genetic exposures. It is further expanded by the transcriptome-wide
association study (TWAS), which relies on heritable gene expression in over 40 tissues throughout the body,
inferred from genome-wide genotype data, and by the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), which
simultaneously interrogates genotype-phenotype associations across vast numbers of phenotypes.
Complementing these variant-based and gene-based approaches are powerful wet-lab direct bulk and single-
cell transcriptome analyses (TA) that decipher underlying biology by comparing patterns of gene expression
between different experimental conditions or phenotypes. Building on progress to date, we will apply these
complementary approaches to decipher genetic underpinnings of HIV-relevant clinical and endophenotypes,
largely through analyses of available data and specimens from numerous different AIDS Clinical Trials Group
trials and cohorts. We will consider interventions that target inflammation, the HIV reservoir, viral replication,
and beyond. This work is facilitated by extensive groundwork laid by the proposing investigators to create and
implement efficient, robust systems for variant-based, gene-based, and RNA expression-based genomic data
generation and data analysis, as well as interpretation and visualization of results. Our ultimate goal is to
improve the lives of people living with HIV through accelerated discovery based on state-of-the-art genomic
approaches."

The overarching goal of this project is to create exhibits and programs that educate broad
audiences, especially Black and Latino adolescents and young adults, about public health
careers and their role in alleviating the inequitable health outcomes that Black and Latino
communities suffer from. We will use the COVID-19 pandemic as the content focus for these
exhibits and programs. Key learning outcomes will include:
 1. COVID-19 and other health challenges have had a disproportionate impact on Black and
 Latino people, for a variety of interconnected reasons;
 2. Minimizing this disproportionate impact will require creating locally-tailored,
 culturally-responsive public health interventions and engaging community-level public
 health experts to recruit and support public participation;
 3. There are many health- and medicine-focused career pathways that young people can
 pursue that can help them contribute to the goal of better protecting vulnerable
 communities from future epidemics and pandemics.
The specific aims of this five-year proposed project are to:
 1. Project Years 1-2: Engage public health experts and community members from Queens,
 NY in a range of public events to build trust, gather input, track the latest emerging
 scientific knowledge COVID-19 and effective tracing, diagnosis and treatment; and guide
 the design and development of exhibits and workshops that address project goals.
 2. Project Year 3: Fabricate five exhibit pieces and create a career exploration workshop
 series that address these goals, pilot them at the New York Hall of Science, evaluate
 their impact and revise as needed.
 3. Project Year 4: Pilot the exhibit pieces and workshop series at a peer science center in
 Oakland, CA, evaluate their impact and revise as needed.
 4. Project year 5: Produce final versions of the exhibit pieces for the New York Hall of
 Science; disseminate exhibit plans for use at other museum sites; disseminate workshop
 formats for use at other museum sites; disseminate evaluation findings.
The project will use formative testing and prototyping to inform the design and development of
educational resources. The project evaluation will use culturally-responsive, rigorous methods to
both monitor project progress and quality and to test the impact of project deliverables on
participants and public audiences."

The existence of active adult neurogenesis in mammals, including humans, suggests striking structural plasticity
and regenerative capacity within the mature nervous system. Adult-born granule cells (GCs) derived from radial
neural stem cells (rNSCs) within the dentate gyrus (DG) have been shown to play a critical role in specific forms
of memory. Impaired memory, commonly associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), correlates with impaired
rNSC behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis in AD mouse models and human patients, likely due to lack of
permissive niche environment to support neurogenesis. Therefore, identifying critical niche components capable
of maintaining NSCs and promoting sustainable neurogenesis will enable development of novel strategies to
enhance functional repair from endogenous NSCs.
 Increasing evidence from human studies have provided tremendous support for the alterations of
cholecystokinin (CCK) system in AD patients. Despite these promising findings, the functional role of CCK in
heathy and AD brains remains unknown. Our goal is to explore the unprecedented role of endogenous CCK in
regulating neurogenic niche and neurogenesis in normal and AD mice. This proposal is built upon a series of
our recent findings. Specifically, we found that stimulating DG CCK interneurons to increase CCK level in the
DG provides a permissive niche environment to support rNSC proliferation and production of proliferating
progeny through the trophic effects of CCK on dentate astrocytes in promoting their glutamatergic
gliotransmission. In contrast, reducing dentate CCK disrupts neurogenic niche by inducing reactive astrocytes
and neuroinflammation, which correlates with decreased activation of rNSCs and production of proliferating
progeny, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role of CCK in DG. Interestingly, 5xFAD mice exhibit dystrophic CCK
neurites and reduced dentate proCCK expression, which correlates with reactive astrocytes, impaired
neurogenesis, and memory deficits. These data suggest that AD pathology may interact with dentate CCK
interneurons to impact various functional aspects associated with DG. These interesting findings sparked the
following directions we would like to pursue. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that dentate astrocytes mediate CCK-
dependent regulation of NSCs and neurogenesis through glutamatergic gliotranmission from astrocytes; Aim 2
is to test the hypothesis that reduced dentate CCK impairs NSC proliferation and neurogenesis through reactive
astrocytes mediated interferon-γ signaling onto NSCs; Aim 3 is to test the hypothesis that increasing dentate
CCK restores impaired neurogenic niche, neurogenesis, and memory in 5xFAD mice."

Flammability requirements are set for consumer products by state and federal agencies, resulting in the addition
of flame retardant chemicals to furniture, textiles, electronics, and other products found ubiquitously in homes
around the world. The production volumes of organophosphate flame retardants (OPES) have drastically
increased in recent years due to the phase-out of the neurotoxic polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame
retardant chemicals. The metabolites of OPES are detectable in biological samples of 77-90% of U.S. adults,
and exposure occurs mainly through accidental dust ingestion. There is a startling lack of research into the health
consequences of exposure to these replacement flame retardants, but they have been linked to neurobehavioral
toxicity and thyroid hormone disruption in animals. Tight thyroid hormone regulation during gestation and early
childhood is essential for normal brain development, and others have speculated that thyroid disruption may be
one mechanism by which OPEs cause neurotoxicity. There is very little research on the consequences of OPE
exposure in humans, and none in children or longitudinal cohorts. We intend to fill this knowledge gap with the
proposed work. Our overarching hypothesis is that exposure to OPEs during gestation and early childhood is
associated with thyroid hormone disruption, decreased child intelligence, and increased ADHD behaviors. In aim
1, we will measure the association between exposure to OPEs at several time points and thyroid function in
children. In aim 2, we will investigate the link between OPE exposure and child intelligence and ADHD symptoms,
including a mediation analysis to determine whether thyroid function lies on this causal pathway. Finally, aim 3
will involve a mixtures analysis of exposure to a combination of OPEs, PBDEs, and lead and the outcome of
child intelligence. To accomplish these aims, we will utilize a well-established prospective pregnancy and birth
cohort in the Greater Cincinnati area—the HOME Study (n=410 births with follow-up to 12 years of age). We
will analyze stored household dust and urine samples from pregnant women and their children to measure
exposure to OPEs at up to nine time-points. We will also examine previously measured thyroid hormone levels
from maternal blood, cord blood, and child blood and draw on an extensive battery of child neurobehavioral data.
For the chemical mixtures analysis, serum PBDE concentrations and blood lead levels have already been
measured from maternal and child samples, and we will employ five different analytical methods to explore
synergistic interactions and joint effects on the outcome of child intelligence. This project will be the among the
first to systematically explore the relationship between pre- and post-natal replacement flame retardant
exposure, TH levels, and neurobehavior in an established birth cohort of children. The results of our chemical
mixtures analysis will give this field additional context and relevance to real-world settings. Our findings will help
inform public health policy around flame retardant chemicals and could help guide environmental health
educational goals for communities."

Nearly 3 million antibiotic resistant infections occur per year in the United States. This problem is especially acute
in gram-negative bacteria, where the outer membrane (OM) which surrounds the aqueous periplasm acts as a
permeability barrier capable of excluding many antibiotics. We are interested in the OM of Enterobacterales (e.g.,
Escherichia, Salmonella, Klebsiella), which are adapted to an enteric environment rich in toxic molecules, such
as bile salts, necessitating an especially strong OM. It has become clear that the permeability of the OM can be
altered by the physiological state of the cell. Specifically, stresses such as nutrient limitation can result in
strengthening of the OM permeability barrier. Elucidation of the pathways responsible for this strengthening will
lead to new targets for the development of small molecules that can weaken the OM permeability barrier. We
have found enterobacterial common antigen (ECA), a conserved component of the Enterobacterales OM and
periplasm, to be important for OM impermeability under stress. Two forms of ECA (phospholipid-linked ECA
(ECAPG), and cyclic ECA (ECACYC)) have different roles related to OM permeability; however, their precise
functions remain unknown, in part, because many steps in their biogenesis are poorly understood.
Our long-term goal is to understand the biogenesis of ECA to facilitate functional studies and identify potential
antimicrobial targets. Specifically, this project aims to elucidate, in Escherichia coli K12, the regulation of and
unknown steps in biogenesis of the forms of ECA contributing to antibiotic resistance. Biochemical reactions are
required for these forms of ECA to be produced and yet the genes responsible for these steps and the regulation
of these steps are largely unknown. The central hypothesis is that ECAPG and ECACYC can be differentiate
through their unique biosynthetic genes and regulatory roles. This hypothesis will be addressed with the following
aims: identify the genes and substrate necessary for ECA to become a phospholipid head group forming ECAPG
using genetic interactions with other biosynthesis pathways (Aim 1); elucidate factors and mechanisms involved
in ECACYC biogenesis using an antibiotic sensitivity suppression phenotype we discovered (Aim 2); and uncover
the mechanisms of the two novel pathways of ECA regulation we discovered (Aim 3). These conceptually
innovative aims will be approached through a blend of high-throughput genomics, genetic screens and
selections, and biochemical techniques. Completion of this project will identify genes and residues important for
biogenesis of ECAPG and ECACYC, which represent targets for development of small molecules weakening the
OM. In addition, this will allow genetic analyses of ECA function, providing insights into Enterobacterales biology."

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies have identified p53 as the most frequently mutated gene in breast
cancer. In particular, 80% of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) harbor p53 mutations. However, there is no
specific therapy available for treating p53-mutant TNBC. Cancer cells have distinct metabolic needs compared
to normal cells, and this observation has spurred the development of small molecule inhibitors to target metabolic
enzymes that are specifically needed by cancer cells for survival. Notably, although there is evidence to support
a role for metabolic pathway deregulation in breast cancer growth, the metabolic dependencies of p53-mutant
TNBC growth and metastasis have not been comprehensively identified. Therefore, to specifically identify the
metabolic dependencies of p53-mutant TNBCs, we performed an innovative and unbiased large-scale in vivo
short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen by targeting 2000 genes with known metabolic functions. With this screen,
we identified N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1 (ASAH1) as an enzyme that is necessary for tumor-forming
ability and metastatic activity of p53-mutant TNBCs. Additionally, we identified two small molecule inhibitors of
ASAH1 with potent anti-p53-mutant TNBC activity, thereby indicating that ASAH1 is a potential drug target for
the treatment of p53-mutant TNBCs. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that p53-mutant TNBC cells
depend upon ASAH1 for their survival, and thus, ASAH1 inhibition selectively eradicates p53-mutant TNBCs.
Our overall objectives are to determine the role of ASAH1 in driving p53-mutant TNBC tumor growth and
metastasis, understand the mechanism underlying the dependency of p53-mutant TNBCs on ASAH1, and
evaluate the translational potential of small molecule ASAH1 inhibitors for treating p53-mutant TNBC. In Aim 1,
we will establish the role of ASAH1 in p53-mutant TNBC tumor growth and metastasis using a series of
complementary, state-of-the-art mouse models that recapitulate characteristic features of TNBC growth and
metastasis. These include a highly innovative humanized mouse model with a human immune system. In Aim
2, we will test our hypotheses that p53 represses ASAH1 activity by sequestering this protein in the nucleus.
Additionally, based on our new preliminary results, we will confirm whether loss of ASAH1 activates the glucose
starvation response, leading to AMP kinase pathway activation via a ceramide-mediated reduction in expression
of the glucose transporter GLUT1 on the cell membrane. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the translational potential of
ASAH1 inhibitors in immunocompromised and immunocompetent humanized mouse models of p53-mutant
TNBC, either alone, or based on our preliminary findings, in combination with BET domain inhibitors. Collectively,
we predict that the results of the experiments proposed in this application will establish ASAH1 as an important
vulnerability inherent to p53-mutant TNBC cells, elucidate the mechanism underlying the dependency of p53-
mutant TNBCs on ASAH1 activity, and evaluate a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of p53-mutant TNBC."

While >90% of TB cases are curable, treatment is dependent on diagnostics based exclusively on the detection
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in patient sputum, despite the limitations of sputum as a diagnostic
sample. Sputum is difficult to process, almost impossible to obtain from patients with paucibacillary TB, such as
people living with HIV (PLWH) and children and is not diagnostic for patients with extrapulmonary TB. A low-
cost, rapid test using blood instead of sputum could transform TB diagnosis for ALL patients and
reduce the current diagnostic gap between patients with and without HIV co-infection. Most active TB
disease (ATB) is still diagnosed with sputum smear microscopy, despite its low sensitivity and specificity. This
lack of diagnostic rigor contributes to the ongoing underdiagnosis of ~3 million TB cases/year, resulting in
continued transmission and poor patient outcomes, especially among PLWH in whom mortality is highest. Our
long-term goal is to transform TB diagnosis with a blood test that accurately distinguishes patients with ATB
from latent TB infection (LTBI), and other pulmonary disorders regardless of co-infection with HIV. The
objective of this study is to demonstrate the analytical and clinical performance of a novel assay for rapid
diagnosis and treatment monitoring of ATB that exploits the precise molecular affinity of CRISPR and
promiscuous nuclease activity of Cas12a to detect ultra-low concentrations of Mtb cell free DNA (cfDNA)
circulating in blood. Preliminary analytical studies indicate assay detection limits of <1fg/µL of Mtb cfDNA in
blood and no cross-reactivity with non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) DNA. Preliminary clinical studies
including adults and children with presumptive TB, as well as samples from a diagnostically challenging cohort
of symptomatic immunocompromised children living with HIV, demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and
specificity in a pooled adult and pediatric group (>90%), and high diagnostic sensitivity (85%) in children. We
will achieve our proposed objective through the following specific aims: AIM 1: Validate a lateral flow version
of the CRISPR-TB assay for low resource settings. Our current working assay requires a PCR step and
fluorescence reader. Preliminary studies indicate we can significantly simplify this workflow using isothermal
amplification and a novel lateral flow (LF) strip for detection of Mtb cfDNA. We will expand on our pilot studies
to validate the existing LF assay using contrived and clinical samples. AIM 2: Define the dynamics of the Mtb
cfDNA signal for treatment monitoring. Preliminary studies indicate the Mtb cfDNA signal decreases to
extinction after treatment initiation but can have non-linear dynamics. We will define the variability and
trajectory of the Mtb cfDNA signal in biobanked serial samples from 34 patients treated for drug resistant TB
over a year, and 50 prospectively collected patients with drug susceptible TB treated over six months. AIM 3:
Determine the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the CRISPR-TB assay in field settings. We will
prospectively collect and test blood samples from 450 patients at risk for TB in TB-endemic field settings with
high (South Africa), medium (Pakistan) and low (Mexico) HIV burden."

Coenzymes and antioxidants mediate hundreds of biochemical reactions and are fundamental to cellular and
mitochondrial function. The redox coenzymes undergo reversible oxidation and reduction reactions, while the
balance between oxidized and reduced forms drive important cellular functions including regulation of ion
channels, cell signaling, cell survival and death. Cellular dysfunction associated with these coenzymes has been
implicated in many diseases including cancer, heart failure, diabetes, obesity and aging. Given the importance
of NAD metabolites and their declining levels in aging, numerous clinical trials of nutritional supplementation of
the coenzymes' precursors are currently underway. Despite the immense interest and the need to determine
cellular and subcellular levels of these metabolites, no reliable method exists currently for their simultaneous and
comprehensive measurement. The major challenge is that these molecules are unstable and their levels are
sensitive to sample harvesting, extraction and measurement conditions. As a result, errors involved with their
measurement using conventional methods often outweigh biological variations and potentially lead to incorrect
inferences. To overcome these challenges, and building on our preliminary studies of methodological
developments using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, in this proposal, we seek to develop
methods to reliably measure the coenzymes and antioxidants in blood, cells, tissue as well as two subcellular
components: mitochondria and cytoplasm. Further, we seek to develop methods to measure these coenzymes
in live cells and mitochondria in real time. We will also translate the protocols and measurements to the widely
used mass spectrometry platform for broader dissemination. The proposed project has three main aims: (1)
Develop methods to reliably measure the coenzymes and antioxidants in blood, tissue, cells and two subcellular
components: mitochondria and cytoplasm using NMR spectroscopy; (2) Develop methods to measure the
coenzymes and antioxidants in live cells and mitochondria in real time using NMR spectroscopy; and (3) use
NMR spectroscopy to guide the translation of the methods for analysis of the unstable (coenzymes and
antioxidants) as well stable metabolites to mass spectrometry for wider applications in the metabolomics field.
The outcome will provide robust methods to analyze important coenzymes and antioxidants in a broad range of
biological sample types that can be used by many researchers. The new methods will also provide novel avenues
for investigation of live cells and mitochondrial metabolism in real time. These developments will impact
numerous areas of biomedical science."

longstanding problems with the usability, contextual fit, and engagement of both those CI and the implementation
strategies (IS) (e.g., consultation models) the support them. This situation also results in high rates of “reactive
adaptations” of CI/IS by their intended users in many settings where they are deployed. Building on our learnings
and successes over the past 4 years, our interdisciplinary research team will draw from the fields of human-
centered design (Drs. Munson, Fogarty), implementation science (Drs. Lyon, Bennett, Locke, Fortney, Bruns,
van Draanen), psychosocial CIs (Drs. Areán, Raue, McCauley, Bearss, Walker), and research methods/data

Departments of Psychiatry and Family Medicine, the Department of Human-Centered Design and Engineering,
the Department of Computer Science, the School of Social Work, the School of Public Health, and the College
of Education. The Center also bridges UW’s many resources: The Institute for Translational Health Sciences
(the UW CTSA), the AIMS Center (UW implementation center for collaborative care), the SMART Center (UW
implementation center for education sector services), the WWAMI-region Practice Research Network (WPRN,
primary care practices in Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho), and the MHTTC Northwest School
Mental Health Network (public school districts across Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Idaho). The Administrative
Core (AC) will serve as the communication hub between Center cores and advisory boards; oversee the selection
of pilot studies; and coordinate mentoring, evaluation, and dissemination. The Methods Core (MC) will provide
research infrastructure to projects and support use of our Discover, Design/Build, Test (DDBT) framework to
address CI/IS usability, engagement, and appropriateness in partnership with local stakeholders. The MC will
also compile project data to update and refine our Typology of CI/IS Modification Targets and Library of Redesign
Solutions for dissemination and assess costs of DDBT-driven redesign. Research projects will collect common
outcome data to determine the impact of modifying CI/IS targets. The Signature R01 will test a DDBT-designed
decision support tool for Problem Solving Treatment in a large network of primary care clinics. R34 #1 will create
a novel IS to support delivery of evidence-based classroom supports for students on the autism spectrum. R34
#2 will modify a well-researched CI for youth trauma for use in education settings. R34 #3 will adapt an existing
effective IS to enhance delivery of school mental health assessment and triage. All four projects, and future pilot
projects, will test effects of redesign on usability, appropriateness, engagement, implementation outcomes, and
patient outcomes."

This program is focused on the discovery, application, and mechanistic elucidation of catalytic reactions that are
stereoselective, environmentally friendly, and useful for the preparation of chiral, bioactive compounds. We seek
to develop novel concepts in catalytic reactivity and selectivity, and apply them to important problems in chemical
synthesis. The premise underlying our current and proposed work is that new classes of small-molecule, chiral
organic catalysts can promote challenging bond constructions, controlling the absolute and/or relative
stereochemistry of the reactions through networks of attractive non-covalent interactions. The overarching goal
is to identify simple organic catalysts that are readily accessible, inexpensive, and bear the minimal structural
features necessary for inducing high levels of stereocontrol in synthetically interesting transformations. We will
pursue several distinct catalytic concepts over the next five-year period, with each of the proposed reactivity
manifolds based on firm mechanistic hypotheses gleaned from extensive preliminary investigations. We will
apply precisely designed chiral ureas, thioureas, and squaramides to catalysis of enantioselective carbon-carbon
and carbon-heteroatom bond-forming reactions. These dual hydrogen-bond donors can abstract or bind weakly
basic anions, such as halides, sulfonates, phosphate, and carboxylates, to promote concerted substitution
reactions or generate chiral ion pairs that remain tightly associated during subsequent enantioselectivity-
determining reactions of the prochiral cations. We discovered that the combination of hydrogen-bond donors
with achiral Lewis or Brønsted acids generates highly reactive complexes that promote activation of weakly
electrophilic substrates to access highly reactive cationic species. This new principle will be directed to creative
applications involving atom-economical carbonyl addition reactions and additions to alkenes. The principle of
anion-binding catalysis will also be examined in pathways where the catalyst-bound anion acts as the nucleophile
in the enantiodetermining bond construction. Activation of polar reagents is applied in desymmetrizing ring-
opening reactions and generation of stereogenic-at-phosphorus compounds. We will also pursue a new strategy
aimed at applying anion binding by chiral H-bond donors to enhance the reactivity and control the stereochemical
outcome of transition-metal catalyzed reactions, and separately in the context of stereoselective and site-
selective glycosylation reactions. We have found that precisely tailored bisthiourea catalysts promote
stereospecific, invertive reactions of alcohol nucleophiles with glycosyl phosphates via cooperative activation of
both the nucleophile and the electrophile. This cooperative mechanism provides a new approach to achieving
control over the site of reaction in minimally protected sugars and other polyfunctional substrates. We also aim
to uncover completely new classes of chiral catalysts, such as a new class of alkali metal isothiourea-boronate
complexes we uncovered unexpectedly and that promote enantioselective, catalytic reactions with highly basic
reacting partners."

World Trade Center (WTC) responders were exposed to a mix of tiny dust particles as they participated in rescue
and recovery efforts at the WTC in the aftermath of 9/11/2001. A significant number continue to suffer from Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of their experiences. These may have changed their expectations
of brain health as they age. Our team has interrogated the potential for early signs of cognitive aging and has
identified higher than expected burden of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and, surprisingly, changes to physical
functional limitations (PFL) common in both physical disability and in neurodegenerative disease. We propose
that MCI is arising early because PTSD and inhaled particulate exposures have caused a neurodegenerative
disease, resulting in increased Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology. We propose to conduct a large study of
WTC-exposed Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) responders that includes cognitive functioning
profiling alongside state-of-the-art proteomic studies of blood-based biomarkers alongside a PET/MRI study of
30 medically healthy WTC responders using two well-validated positron emission tomography (PET) ligands
([11C]-PiB to measure β-amyloid, and [18F]-Flortaucipir to measure tauopathy). Detailed cognitive testing will help
to determine the level of cognitive dysfunction. Simultaneous structural MRI will be used to measure the extent
of neurodegeneration. This study is timely because we are in a critical period when neuropathology is
emerging and the etiology of the disease is still possible to determine."

Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S., and the number of
Americans living with Alzheimer's disease or Alzheimer's disease-related dementias
(AD/ADRD) is expected to increase from 5.7 to 14 million by 2050. Therefore, the need for a
qualified and sustainable workforce is now more important than ever. Direct care nursing staff
such as licensed practical nurses (LPNs) and certified nursing assistants (CNAs) are an
essential part of the workforce in skilled nursing facilities, caring for more than 700,000 U.S.
residents diagnosed with AD/ADRD. Understanding the interactions between factors that impact
work environment, workforce characteristics, and dementia care training are important to better
inform programs that can improve health outcomes for AD/ADRD residents in US skilled nursing
facilities and make for appealing dementia care jobs. Very little is known about the
characteristics of the front-line dementia care workforce, their work environment as it relates to
caring for residents with AD/ADRD (e.g., resident to staff violence; racial discrimination); and the
specialized training this low-wage workforce receives, especially when only half of the U.S.
states require specific dementia care training. The ultimate goal of this research study is to
better understand how these relationships impact the care outcomes among residents. We will
do so by accomplishing the following: (1) survey LPNs and CNAs on their work environment and
dementia care training experiences; (2) conduct focus groups among a sub-sample of facility
directors of nursing or directors of staff development to do an in depth examination of the
elements in their dementia care training; and (3) look at whether worker experiences and
training components are associated with care outcomes. The proposed study aligns with several
objectives outlined in NIA's Strategic Plan, specifically Goal E: Improve our understanding of the
consequences of an aging society to inform intervention development and policy decisions and
Goal F: Understand health disparities related to aging and develop strategies to improve the
health status of older adults in diverse populations. More specifically, it supports NOSI NOT-
AG-20-026 by conducting research on the impact of dementia care training on quality as well as
the supports available to the dementia care workforce in SNFs to encourage retention. Results
will provide an evidence base on which to amend or create new current state policies regarding
the content needed in dementia care training programs among this workforce."

Cellular responses to available macronutrients and extra-cellular signals rely on the unique epigenetic state of
the cell, defined by a layer of biochemical information above the genome that dictates specific gene
expression. The epigenome consists of DNA sequence-dependent proteins, non-coding RNAs, DNA
methylation and histone post-translation modifications (PTMs) such as lysine acetylation and methylation. The
latter two mechanisms are catalyzed by enzymes that must ‘interpret’ incoming signals, ‘read’ the existing
epigenetic landscape and ‘respond’ appropriately. Enzymes that modify histones and non-histone proteins
such as methyltransferases, demethylases, acetyltransferases and deacetylases use central metabolites (S-
adenosyl methionine, SAM; α-ketoglutarate, αKG; acetyl-CoA and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NAD+,
respectively) as co-substrates. New evidence suggests that fluctuation in such epi-metabolites caused by diet,
environment, microbiota and genetics can drive PTM dynamics, however the relevant mechanisms remain
unclear in most cases. Are changes in epi-metabolites sensed by signaling pathways or by substrate-level
driven catalysis or both? Also, does local production of epi-metabolites enable/accelerate gene expression
mechanisms on chromatin?
Non-histone protein acetylation is a major PTM that can regulate many aspects of cellular function and occurs
in all cellular compartments. But despite broad knowledge of what gets modified, the most pressing challenge
is to understand the how, the why and the when, which constitutes an overarching theme of this proposal. A
major portion of the research to understand reversible protein acetylation as a regulatory PTM will involve
knowledge of how pathway-specific acetyl-CoA (and other acyl-CoAs) production leads to dynamic acetylation
after extra-cellular stimulation. Also, this work will focus on the detailed molecular mechanisms by which
nuclear NAD+-dependent deacetylases SIRT6/7 (Sirtuins 6 & 7) are regulated and how these enzymes perform
such exquisite deacetylation of nucleosomes. A sub-theme of this proposal that connects these two projects is
to understand the fundamental principles that govern PTM enzymes acting on chromatin/nucleosomes. This
proposal is uniquely poised to make major advances to these salient questions. To accomplish these goals,
the projects synergistically employ in vitro biochemistry/biophysics, complementary genetics and
pharmacology, and cell- and animal-based models. Results from these investigations will provide i.) insight into
the etiology of diseases resulting from the link between metabolism and the epigenome, ii.) foundations for
drug development against the enzymes described here, and iii.) a fundamental understanding of how the cell
‘interprets’ incoming signals in the context of existing epigenetic information and ‘responds’ appropriately."
10791898,"Title: Mechanism of CX3CR1+ macrophage-mediated resolution of eosinophilic allergic lung inflammation
Abstract:
Recent studies show that tissue-resident macrophages participate in not only the initiation of inflammation but
also in the resolution and prevention of local inflammation. To precisely determine the subsets of macrophages
engaged in resolving lung inflammation and gain insight into their functions, we adopted new techniques of
mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq (sc-RNA-seq) to analyze human and mouse macrophages in the
lung. Our supporting data showed that alveolar macrophages (AMs) are phenotypically diverse and highly
dynamic in response to allergen challenge. Based on the sc-RNA-seq data, AMs can be clustered into a few
groups at a steady status. Among these groups, a subset of CX3CR1-expressing AMs (CX3CR1+ AMs) are
unique in terms of their phenotype and patterns of gene expression, compared to classical resident AMs which
are CX3CR1 negative. In patients with allergic asthma and a mouse model of asthma, we found that CX3CR1+
AMs are markedly increased in BAL by allergen challenge. The CX3CR1+ AMs express not only the
macrophage but also eosinophil markers such as human Siglec-8. Further investigation with the CX3CR1-
reporter and Epx-cre (a.k.a. Eo-cre) reporter mice reveals that CX3CR1+ macrophages engulf eosinophils at a
steady state and in allergic lung inflammation. Depletion of CX3CR1+ macrophages in mouse models resulted
in spontaneous tissue eosinophilia at a steady status and prolonged tissue eosinophilia in allergic lung
inflammation. Based on this data, we hypothesized that the newly recruited CX3CR1+ AM subset promote the
clearance of tissue eosinophils and facilitates the resolution of allergic lung inflammation. In aim 1, we will
focus on the cellular dynamics of CX3CR1+ macrophages in allergic lung inflammation. Regarding the
molecular mechanism of CX3CR1+ mediated-eosinophil clearance, we examined the potential ligands for
CX3CR1 – CX3CL1 and CCL26. We discovered that CCL26 plays a key role in activating CX3CR1+
macrophages, whereas CX3CL1 is indispensable. Our sc-RNA-seq data revealed that CX3CR1+ AM subset is
the sole source of the transcript of C1q - a key molecule for efferocytosis. In in-vitro setting, CCL26 triggers
CX3CR1+ macrophages to secrete C1q in a CX3CR1 receptor-mediated manner. Furthermore, C1q and CCL26
are increased in BAL by allergen challenge in patients with allergic asthma. This data suggests CCL26
activates CX3CR1+ macrophages to facilitate efferocytosis via C1q secretion. In aim 2, we will examine the
detailed mechanisms of CX3CR1+ macrophage activation through CCL26-mediated C1q secretion. Finally, we
will extend the study to translational human research using the IRB-approved protocol for the segmental
provocation with an allergen to evaluate the human relevance of the above proposed experiments. The
proposed study is based on our strong supporting data on the new roles of CX3CR1+ macrophages in the
resolution of allergic lung inflammation. This study will lead to a better understanding of the resolution process
of allergic asthma."
10880241,"This is a competing renewal application for funds to support pre- and postdoctoral training in Integrative
Neuroscience at the Center for Neural Science at New York University. This proposal aims to continue and
enhance a successful implementation of our training program focused on four interrelated core areas of
investigation: learning, memory, development and plasticity. The proposed training program includes a
partnership with the Graduate Program in Neuroscience and Physiology at the NYU School of Medicine. We
seek to renew our support at the level of 5 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral fellows. This number of trainees
requested is based primarily on the importance of fostering a cohesive training group of a sufficient size to
support trainee development across levels, from pre to post-doctoral and from cellular-molecular to systems
and cognitive approaches, across program divisions, and between translational and basic research. This
represents an increase of one trainee, with a clinical/translational focus. Our proposed training program will
provide a central focus for pre and postdoctoral training in areas of neuroscience critical to advancing
knowledge of development and degeneration of the nervous system, neural disease processes, and
disorders of memory and mental health. Our trainees will have the opportunity to be a part of a cohort of
world class scientists engaged in cutting-edge research related to learning, memory, development and
plasticity. We have compiled a group of 26 training faculty that will provide an integrative, collaborative
training experience that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries, spans levels of analysis, and levels of
training. The trainees, predoctoral fellows in the third year or higher and postdoctoral fellows in the early
years post-PhD, will have access to a special seminar series, individualized mentoring, opportunities to
develop translational thinking, and workshops to promote balanced professional and academic skills
important for future success. In this renewal, we have added a specific postdoctoral training component. We
expect our trainees to remain in the program for 1-2 years, at which time we expect that they will have
obtained independent funding or transitioned to another research support mechanism. In either case, they
will have a continuing, high-level of support from the program. We seek to build a steadily growing cohort of
scientists with shared goals and interests, that will advance the goals of NIMH for research into the neural
mechanisms of development, disorders and mental disease."
10840280,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal presents a plan for the candidate’s career enhancement that focuses on studying hemodynamic
etiology of white matter lesions (WML) in the context of risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The goal is to
uncover physiological mechanisms that may inform development of therapies for reducing WML-related
cognitive decline in older adults at elevated risk for AD.
Candidate: The candidate is an Instructor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts
General Hospital. His research interests are to explore relationships between microvascular physiology and AD
by developing novel methods for imaging microvascular function as markers of disease. The candidate’s
academic training has provided a foundation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, with a focus in
cerebrovascular diseases. His research efforts thus far have resulted in a publication record, conference
awards, and success in obtaining funding that demonstrate his strong potential to develop into a successful
investigator. However, there are gaps between the candidate’s background in MRI methods development and
his current interests in small vessel disease in aging and dementia. The candidate’s plan for career
enhancement addresses these gaps with training in aging and dementia, small vessel disease, and human
study design. This coursework will be complemented with experimental training that leverages his background
in MRI of microvascular function to bridge his transition to independence.
Research: AD is expected to impact 13.8 million Americans by 2050, necessitating a more complete
understanding of the etiology and the development of markers for diagnosis and progression. Beta-amyloid
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles characterize AD pathology, but WMLs of presumed small vessel origin are
an independent contributor to cognitive decline in AD patients. The high prevalence of WML in patients with AD
suggests that cerebrovascular disease may play an important role in the pathophysiology of AD. However, the
physiological mechanisms contributing to the development of WML remain unclear. A better understanding of
the microvascular physiology associated with the formation of these white matter lesions may inform the
development of therapies aimed at preventing or delaying associated cognitive decline in AD patients. A critical
barrier to understanding relevant physiology is the lack of sensitive methods for noninvasively measuring
microvascular function in white matter. The objective of this work is to apply sensitive MRI protocols at 7 Tesla
for measuring white matter hemodynamics towards answering focused questions regarding hemodynamic
function in older adults at elevated risk for AD. Results will also inform the design of longitudinal human studies
examining the role of promising microvascular markers in stratifying high risk individuals for preventative
therapies aimed at reducing the burden of WML burden-related cognitive decline."

Childhood undernutrition is a global health challenge manifested by impaired ponderal growth (wasting/acute
malnutrition), impaired linear growth (stunting), immune and metabolic dysfunctions, altered CNS development
plus other abnormalities. >30M children worldwide suffer from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) with
prevalence anticipated to worsen significantly with the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, 159M children are
stunted. Current treatments have limited effectiveness. By analyzing serially collected fecal samples from
healthy members of Bangladeshi birth cohorts and those with MAM, we found that MAM is associated with
impaired microbiota development (microbiota immaturity). We have developed a microbiota-directed
formulation of complementary foods that repairs their microbiota, resulting in significantly greater
improvements in ponderal growth compared to an existing nutritional intervention, and revealing mechanisms
by which microbiota members are linked to host mediators of healthy growth. The role of the small intestinal
(SI) microbiota in childhood undernutrition remains enigmatic in part because of the difficulty in obtaining
samples. Associations between altered SI absorptive function, asymptomatic enteropathogen infection and
stunting, have led to the hypothesis that subclinical enteric dysfunction contributes to growth faltering.
Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is a SI enteropathy of unknown etiology first described in adult Peace
Corps volunteers, returning from areas of high fecal-oral contamination, with diarrhea, intestinal malabsorption,
reduced villus height/number and gut barrier function disruption. Studies of EED have relied on non-validated
fecal or plasma biomarkers making its contribution to childhood undernutrition ill-defined. Our Bangladesh
Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (BEED) study involved endoscopy of stunted children who failed a
nutritional intervention, which revealed a group of SI bacterial taxa whose absolute abundances negatively
correlate with linear growth; a cultured consortium of these duodenal taxa produced SI enteropathy in recipient
gnotobiotic mice. We now propose to test the hypothesis that the SI microbiota contributes to SI enteropathy
and malnutrition (low-BMI) in women of childbearing age and, via transmission to their children, to perpetuate
intergenerational undernutrition. Our 4 specific aims will compare the SI microbiota plus the duodenal mucosal
and plasma proteomes of malnourished Bangladeshi women (BMI<18.5kg/m2) of child-bearing age with
histopathologic evidence of enteropathy versus those with normal BMIs (20-24.9kg/m2) and no histopathologic
evidence of enteropathy, determine whether their SI microbiota transmits SI enteropathy and impaired growth
to gnotobiotic mice, ascertain whether these phenotypes are prevented/rescued by SI microbial community
members from normal-BMI Bangladeshi women without enteropathy, and screen biochemically-diverse plant
polysaccharides in our mouse models for their effects on enteropathy/growth, with leads advanced to
gnotobiotic piglets."
10832559,"Project 1: Epithelial Immune Cell Interactions in Persistent T2 Inflammation
Project Summary
Type-2 (T2) inflammation of the airways is an important therapeutic target in asthma, particularly for individuals
who have persistent T2 inflammation despite adequate conventional therapy. Recent work from our laboratory
demonstrates that mast cells (MC)s and eosinophils (Eos) infiltrate the airway epithelium in asthma in close
association with airway dysfunction in the form of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and have distinct spatial
relationships with T2 airway inflammation. To model interactions between the epithelium and these classically
defined innate effector cells, we developed models of primary airway epithelial cells (AECs) cocultured with
these cells, revealing that both MCs and Eos engage in feed-forward loops that regulate epithelial gene
expression in a manner that is accentuated when MCs are cocultured with primary AECs from children with
asthma. We extended this model to ex vivo respiratory viral infection with human rhinovirus-A16 (RV16) and
discovered bidirectional regulatory circuits including novel regulators of T2 gene expression by MCs. Our
central hypothesis is that the epithelium acts in concert with MCs and Eos in the setting of respiratory
viral infection to propagate inflammation through T2 and non-T2 mechanisms that lead to persistent T2
inflammation of the airways. We further hypothesize that these mechanisms are accentuated in
individuals with T2-high asthma and that there are identifiable components of this T2 inflammation that
persist despite corticosteroid treatment. Our initial results identified specific candidates for these
bidirectional circuits between traditionally defined regulators of type-1 (T1) and type-3 (T3) inflammation and
the persistence of T2 inflammation, including epithelial-derived interferons (IFN)s, IL-33, IL-36g, IL-18, and IL-
1b. We have also found that the epithelium promotes sustained T2 gene expression in MCs, which is only
partly attenuated by maximal dose corticosteroids. This project will investigate the bidirectional interactions
between MCs and Eos with primary AECs from individuals with T2-high as compared to non-T2 asthma and
elucidate mechanisms by which RV16 infection and specific mediators induced by RV16 perpetuate
inflammation. In Specific Aim 1, we examine epithelial-MC circuits, focusing on T1 and T3 signals that
propagate T2 and other gene networks expressed in MCs and the components that are not sensitive to
corticosteroids. In Specific Aim 2 we extend these results to examine how Eos and MCs act together as a
functional unit within the epithelial microenvironment. In Specific Aim 3 we conduct ex vivo studies of airway
cells from individuals with asthma and complement these studies with an in vivo human ICAM1 transgenic
mouse model to examine the transcriptional response of MCs and Eos to epithelial-derived cytokines and
infection with RV16. Completion of these studies will provide a better understanding of the interplay between
the airway epithelium and relevant innate immune cells in the context of respiratory viral infection and the
persistence of inflammation in the face of inhaled corticosteroid therapy."

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the second most common cause of heart failure world-wide, and inherited
forms of DCM make up 30% of non-ischemic cases. MYH7, which encodes beta-cardiac myosin (M2β), is one
of the more commonly mutated genes and is the molecular motor that powers contraction in ventricular
cardiomyocytes. This proposal is focused on examining the structural and functional impact of DCM mutations
in human M2β, with an overall goal of determining molecular mechanisms of contractile defects and developing
a foundation for therapeutic strategies. The force, velocity, and power generating capacity of muscle is related
to the ability to recruit myosin molecules in the thick filament to interact with actin in the thin filament of the
muscle sarcomere. The recruited myosin molecules generate force by utilizing a conserved ATPase cycle in
which myosin generates a power stroke while interacting with actin. Cardiac myosin can exist in the auto-inhibited
state with slow ATP turnover (super relaxed state, SRX) in which head-head and head-tail interactions prevent
it from interacting with actin (interacting heads motif, IHM) or the uninhibited state (disordered relaxed state,
DRX) that is readily available to produce force. The recruited myosin also impacts the calcium sensitivity of the
myofilaments because myosin binding cooperatively activates the actin thin filament. We will test the central
hypothesis that DCM mutations impair systolic contraction in the heart by altering the intrinsic force producing
ability of individual cardiac myosin molecules, stabilizing the SRX/IHM state, and/or altering cooperative
activation of the actin thin filament. In the first Aim we will examine the impact of the DCM mutations on the
myosin ATPase cycle, duty ratio, and formation of the SRX state. The structural impact of the mutations will be
examined by using a FRET biosensor that monitors the myosin power stroke and another FRET sensor that
examines IHM state formation. Electron microscopy will also be used to evaluate the formation of the IHM state
which will be directly compared to the fluorescence spectroscopy and biochemical analysis. Aim 2 will examine
the impact of DCM mutations on the single molecule mechanical properties of human M2β, including step size
and load-dependent detachment, using a load clamped optical trap. In Aim 3 we will utilize a computational
model of muscle contraction to predict how the parameters measured in Aims 1&2 will impact ensemble force,
velocity, and power. We will then directly examine the impact of the mutations on the force generating properties
by incorporating the human M2β constructs into DNA-based “designer” thick filaments, and examining their ability
to interact with regulated thin filaments in a calcium dependent manner. The force, velocity, and power
measurements will be performed in the “designer” thick filaments, which contain native thick filament-like
geometric spacing of myosin molecules. Overall, the completion of the specific aims of this proposal will enhance
our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in DCM and provide a foundation for
developing therapies for treating DCM."

 Cancer epigenetics has driven a surge of research in recent years as several chromatin-
associated factors have been identified in the process of tumorigenesis. A critical chromatin-
modifying protein involved in active transcription, SETD2, has been found to be mutated in
approximately 15% of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). ccRCC patients have shown
resistance to both chemotherapy and conventional radiation therapies, and although major
therapeutic advances have been made, only a fraction of patients shows durable clinical
responses and long-term remission; thus, there is an urgent need for novel therapies in the field.
 Typically, SETD2 mutations are grouped as functionally identical; however, they can be
grouped according to their structural or enzymatic characteristics. This project seeks to answer
the question of how the loss of SETD2 protein is molecularly distinct from loss of its enzymatic
activities. The first aim will use ChIP-seq and biochemical studies to determine the relationship
between SETD2 mutation and differential chromatin dysregulation and to elucidate the particular
mechanism in which another protein or peptide fragment acts aberrantly in the absence of SETD2.
The second aim will use ChIP-seq and cellular studies to determine how distinct molecular
mechanisms of SETD2 mutations in the context of ccRCC results in differential ccRCC
development and progression.

Emerging data indicate that up to 50% of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) results from failure
to attain maximal lung function in early adulthood, rather than accelerated decline in lung function later in life.
Because lung function trajectories are established soon after birth, deficits in lung function in infancy may
persist and predispose to COPD in adulthood. Many preterm infants are born with lungs in the saccular stage
of development. Lung inflammation in these infants can lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a
complication of prematurity characterized by altered development with dilated and fewer airspaces in the distal
lung. Along with respiratory morbidity during childhood, patients with BPD are at risk for reduced peak lung
function in their adult years and may develop COPD. To understand mechanisms connecting aberrant early
lung development to long-term abnormalities in lung growth and function, we developed a transgenic model in
which IKKβ, an upstream activator of NF-κB, can be expressed in the lungs in a developmental-stage specific
manner. Using this model, we found that transient inflammation in the saccular stage (but not the alveolar
stage) reduced expression of fibulin-5, a critical elastin assembly component, and resulted in altered elastic
fiber organization and dilated terminal airspaces. Remarkably, mice with saccular stage inflammation
demonstrated persistent abnormalities in lung elastic fiber organization and developed a COPD-like phenotype
with emphysema and loss of alveolar attachments that progressed from 2 to 24 months of age. Neutrophil
depletion during the saccular stage rescued the lung phenotype in these mice. Further, we found that
neutrophil elastase downregulates fibulin-5 expression by mouse lung fibroblasts and alters saccular stage
elastin assembly ex vivo, potentially through activation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. These
findings support the hypothesis that neutrophil elastase downregulates fibulin-5 expression and alters elastic
fiber assembly in the saccular stage lung, thereby predisposing to COPD in adulthood. Specific aims are
designed to: 1) delineate the mechanisms by which neutrophils impair elastic fiber assembly in the saccular
stage, 2) determine the role and regulation of mesenchymal-derived fibulin-5 in elastic fiber assembly during
lung development, and 3) investigate the long-term effects of impaired elastic fiber assembly in the lung.
Collectively, proposed studies will determine the impact of inflammation during a critical developmental window
on both neonatal and adult lung disease. A mechanistic understanding of the developmental origins of COPD
will empower future investigations to prevent and/or treat this debilitating disease."

 Keratoconus is a chronic, lifelong corneal dystrophy and affects approximately 1:400 people worldwide,
including both males and females. Treating patients with advanced keratoconus has always been a challenge.
Corneal transplantation remains the gold standard for treatment, however, significant risk of postoperative
complications exist. Presently, keratoconus is diagnosed with specialized equipment and tests such as slit-lamp
and Pentacam®. Early diagnosis, where irregular astigmatism can complicate things, is critical for the
management of keratoconus. To-date, there are no biomarker tests which has consequently driven demand for
novel approaches to assist in the diagnosis, management and/or treatment of keratoconus.
 Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-delimited particles released by cells, which may provide a
real-time snapshot of the entire cell/tissue/organ in a non-invasive way. EVs can regulate physiological
processes and contain components including proteins, miRNAs, DNA fragments, non-coding RNAs and lipids.
Therefore, EVs hold promise for the discovery of future biomarkers. In the context of corneal
diseases/dystrophies, tear fluid and tear EVs (tEVs) are the best candidate for biomarker investigations.
Surprisingly, very few studies have been reported (only Dry eye and Sjogren’s syndrome) investigating tEVs.
Our preliminary data provides strong evidence for the existence of tEVs in keratoconus patients that are
phenotypically different from their healthy counterparts. The proposed clinical studies aim to unravel the role of
tEVs in keratoconus pathobiology and discover relevant biomarkers associated with age, sex, and disease
severity. During our preliminary studies, we have recruited a small cohort of healthy and keratoconus patients,
and have put together a strong group of clinicians/collection sites that will assist us with sample collection during
the proposed period. Our data suggests significant phenotypic differences in the tEVs derived from keratoconus
patients, compared to healthy controls. We, therefore, propose an integrated multi-faceted “fingerprint” approach
that will include tEV physical characterization, proteomics, and miRNA profiling. We believe that our strategy can
shed light on future directions in this field for keratoconus diagnosis, management, and even treatment.
Relevance to Public Health – KC is a major clinical problem resulting in visual impairment worldwide. The long-

translational, clinically relevant, and in line with NEI’s goals and research priorities to understand KC and develop
novel treatment options to reduce the burden of the disorder worldwide."

The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) are both critical for learning and memory-guided behavior.
Coordination of neural activity between these regions is necessary for memory and cognitive processes,
however, the nature of these interactions and their roles are still unclear. We have established multiple timescale
neural representations in these regions for spatial learning and memory-guided behavior, with inter-regional
coordination during spatial firing and theta oscillations in exploratory behavior, and during sharp-wave ripple
(SWR) associated replay in sleep and awake immobility periods. Here, we will investigate the roles of these
physiological network patterns in learning and memory-guided navigation by combining behavioral methods in
rats, high-density recordings, and causal manipulation methods. (Aim 1) The influence of reward on mnemonic
representations is key to understanding the role of hippocampal-prefrontal activity patterns in memory-guided
behavior. In particular, it is known that reward changes influence hippocampal replay, and replay is thought to
play a role in linking actions to reward for reinforcement learning. To address this question directly, we have
developed methods in TH-Cre rats for optogenetic tagging and identification of dopaminergic ventral tegmental
area (VTA) neurons which encode reward prediction error, simultaneously with recordings from hippocampal
and prefrontal ensembles. We will record and manipulate VTA dopamine neuron firing to examine the influence
on replay and task representations in the hippocampal-prefrontal network during learning of new spatial rules.
(Aim 2) The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are both known to be important for contextual encoding and
generalizing experiences across contexts, but the mechanisms are unclear. Our preliminary data show rule-
selective encoding by prefrontal neurons that is maintained across spatial contexts, whereas hippocampal CA1
neurons remap across contexts. Further, we have also found coordinated hippocampal-prefrontal ripples vs
independent cortical ripples with distinct reactivation patterns. We will examine whether hippocampal-prefrontal
ensembles underlie rule representations and contextual encoding, whether theta sequences maintain encoding
of current context, and test the hypothesis that replay during coordinated ripples enables associations across
contexts. (Aim 3) Goal representations are considered central to navigation, but the mechanisms for goal coding
and hippocampal-prefrontal representations for memory-guided navigation are still unclear. Our preliminary data
using a complex 2-d maze with flexible goal locations and barriers supports goal representations and replay by
hippocampal and prefrontal ensembles during navigation. We will test the hypotheses that hippocampal and
prefrontal replay events during immobility support planning of upcoming trajectories, and goal representations
impact theta sequences for online maintenance during trajectory execution. Overall, our results will provide novel
insight into fundamental learning and memory mechanisms that are affected in aging and memory disorders
such as Alzheimer’s disease."

The purpose of this program is to provide a 12-week mentored research experience for veterinary students at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The traditional veterinary curriculum lacks formal training in performance
of research: therefore, this summer research exposure experience is an essential way to expose DVM
students to the research process within a tier-one research institution and encourage them to consider
research-oriented careers. This program has been integral to our ability to recruit prospective veterinary
medical students with research interests to our DVM professional program at the University of Wisconsin-

pursuing research training, informing veterinary medical students of careers in research, and exposing
veterinary students to important discussions related to research ethics, responsible conduct of research, and
the skills and tools required for successful careers in research. The over-arching objective of this program is to
introduce veterinary medical students to research. They gain a working knowledge of how to identify a
problem of significance to the health and welfare of animals and/or humans, learn how to develop a hypothesis
to test focused questions, build a plan to identify and validate appropriate techniques to pursue, analyze and
report data. The students undergo workshops to promote excellent science communication in both oral and
written formats. Trainees participate in regularly scheduled laboratory meetings and weekly seminars designed
specifically for these goals within the 12-week summer timeline. Trainees are expected to present the results of
their research at the summer veterinary research scholars symposium (typically the NIH-Boehringer Ingelheim
Veterinary Scholars Program Symposium held annually in August) or at seminars or symposiums held at the
University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine. The University of Wisconsin in general, and the School
of Veterinary Medicine in particular, provides an ideal environment to support short-term research training for
veterinary students. The proposed program is designed to integrate with additional graduate research training
programs within the School of Veterinary Medicine to provide a continuum of support for veterinary students
that are inspired to pursue advanced research training."

based in vivo multiplexing technology (SAFE; Ko et al., 2022, Nat Biotech, in press; Ko et al., Adv Science,
2022 in press), that for the first time allows intravital imaging far beyond what is currently possible (~12-20

technology and then use it to gain deeper temporal and spatial insight into the tumor microenvironment. We
propose two specific aims: i) Optimize the SAFE-IVM technology for broader (~30 channel) multiplexed in vivo
imaging (new chemistry including novel iTCO, Tz-BHQ, expand colors, improve imaging chambers); and ii)
perform multiplexed imaging of tumor microenvironment and its immune cells. Findings from latter studies will
be important because they will i) establish the utility of the new technology benchmarked against gold
standards and ii) open the door to broader applicability of the new technology."

The purpose of this MERIT renewal is to continue our studies on hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) and its
roles in kidney-specific gene expression and cystic kidney diseases. HNF-1β is a DNA-binding transcription
factor that regulates tissue-specific gene expression in the kidney and other epithelial organs. Mutations of HNF-
1β produce congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, cystic kidney disease, autosomal dominant
tubulointerstitial kidney disease, and inherited tubulopathies. To unravel the pathogenesis of these disorders,
we have produced HNF-1β mutant mice that develop phenotypes similar to those seen in affected humans.
Analysis of the mutant mice has revealed that HNF-1β plays a central role in the expression of polycystic kidney
disease genes, such as PKD2 and PKHD1. During the last project period, we used genome-wide ChIP-seq and
RNA-seq to identify transcriptional networks that are directly regulated by HNF-1β. Together with new mutant
mouse models, these studies uncovered novel roles of HNF-1β in the regulation of Wnt signaling, cAMP
signaling, lipid metabolism, urinary concentration, and expression of noncoding RNAs. Preliminary studies using
mass spectrometry revealed that HNF-1β interacts with proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, histone
modification, and transcription elongation. In the next project period we will extend this work to further unravel
the functions of HNF-1β in the kidney. Specific Aim 1 will use biochemical studies to unravel the molecular
mechanisms whereby HNF-1β represses Wnt pathway genes. We will test the hypothesis that HNF-1β forms
repressive chromatin loops that exert long-range effects on histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and
transcription elongation. Specific Aim 2 will apply mouse genetics to elucidate the roles of dysregulated Wnt
signaling in the HNF-1β mutant phenotype. We will determine whether mutations of Wnt pathway genes that are
overexpressed in HNF-1β mutant mice improve kidney function and structure. Collectively, the proposed studies
will advance our understanding of gene regulation, unravel how mutations of HNF-1β produce kidney
abnormalities, and identify potential therapeutic targets for HNF-1β-related cystic kidney diseases."
10861797,"Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects more than 12 million people worldwide and is
a common cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). ADPKD is caused by mutations in one of two genes,
PKD1 or PKD2, which encodes polycystin 1 (PC) and PC2 respectively. Loss of PC1 or PC2 results in
activation of numerous kinases and downstream signaling pathways, which is central to the pathogenesis of
cyst growth in ADPKD. In addition, pharmacologically inhibiting a number of different kinases up-regulated in
PKD kidneys has been shown to slow cyst growth in animal models of PKD making kinase inhibitors among
the most promising class of drug candidates to treat patients with ADPKD. However, while the human kinome
consists of more than 500 kinases, only a fraction of these kinases have been tested to determine if they play a
role in ADPKD pathogenesis. As a result, there are likely many kinases that are active in ADPKD kidneys that
play prominent roles in cyst growth that are yet-to-be discovered and may be good therapeutic targets.
 In collaboration with James Duncan at Temple University, we have now adapted a novel approach to
broadly screen PKD kidneys in an unbiased manner for kinases that are more active in lysates from
PKD kidneys compared with lysates from wild type kidneys. In this assay, active kinases are affinity
captured by passing lysates over multiplex inhibitor beads (MIB) containing a cocktail of kinase inhibitors.
Bound kinases are then identified by LC separation followed by quantitative tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS). Using this approach, we have now identified a number of both known and unknown kinases
specifically up-regulated and down-regulated in PKD kidneys.
The major goal of this proposal is to assess the role of several of the kinases identified thus far whose activity
is increased in PKD kidneys and determine whether inhibiting or activating any of the kinases identified slows
cyst growth, inhibits interstitial fibrosis, and preserves renal function in animal models of ADPKD. We will then
take both biased and unbiased approaches to identify the signaling pathways regulated by these kinases that
are critical to pathogenesis with the goal of developing a more complete picture of the relevant signaling hubs
and networks that are aberrantly activated in PKD kidneys. In addition, we will use this technology to broadly
screen PKD kidneys from a variety of different “early” and “late” mouse models of ADPKD at different stages in
cyst formation and in kidneys from human patients with ADPKD to identify in an unbiased manner additional
kinases that are activated and inhibited in PKD kidneys to determine the similarities and differences between
mouse models, which kinases may be most relevant to human disease, and whether distinct sets of kinases
are activated early post cyst induction and function as early “drivers” of cyst growth. Ultimately, we hope this
new information will identify new safe drug targets and rational approaches to combination therapies to slow
cyst growth that can then be translated into clinical trials."

Developmental Biology research is fundamental to progress in determining the molecular basis of many
diseases, as well as for the rapidly emerging field of regenerative medicine. During COBRE Phases I and II,
we welcomed 12 new investigators, many of whom use model organisms (planarians, Drosophila, zebrafish,
and C. elegans) whose genomes can be efficiently manipulated to understand fundamental physiological
processes that are conserved among species. In some cases, functional genomic approaches were used to
model human mutations to understand the basis of devastating inherited diseases. All our Project Leads were
rigorously trained in Developmental Biology, published in top tier journals, and showed exceptional promise.
Their appointments were deliberately divided among four of OMRF’s Research Programs (equivalent to
academic departments) to encourage cross-fertilization and attract established investigators to the field. We
now have a critical mass of Developmental Biologists that includes COBRE-supported investigators as well as
more established faculty.
 During Phases I and II we also established and expanded Cores that provide essential services to
Developmental Biologists: an Imaging Core and a Bioinformatics and Pathways Core. Our goals in Phase III
are to consolidate the progress we have made in Phases I and II by welcoming new Developmental Biologists
into our community through the support of Pilot Projects and to expand the services offered by our Cores, while
at the same time positioning them for sustainability when COBRE funding ends. We will accomplish our goals
through the following Specific Aims.
Aim 1. To expand the breadth of our research program in Developmental Biology through the choice of Pilot
Project Investigators with outstanding potential to become leaders in their fields. Aim 2. To mentor the Pilot
Project Investigators using a combination of senior scientists and recently graduated COBRE Project Leads
within existing OMRF and University of Oklahoma faculty. Aim 3. To form an External Advisory Committee of
internationally recognized Developmental Biologists to evaluate the progress of, and offer advice to, the Pilot
Project Investigators and Core Directors. Aim 4. To expand the capabilities of the Core facilities so they are
well-positioned to support the research of both current and future Developmental Biologists (including current

Type 2 diabetes is the most expensive chronic disease in the U.S. Nutritional management of type 2 diabetes
has the potential to improve glycemic control and clinical outcomes with fewer side effects and lower costs
than intensive medical management. However, we are far from fully realizing the potential of nutritional
management to improve diabetes outcomes. One important limitation is the lack of high-quality research. Last
year, the American Diabetes Association’s (ADA’s) Nutrition Review Committee (on which the PI served)
concluded that: “Despite widespread interest in evidence-based diabetes nutrition therapy interventions, large,
well-conducted nutrition trials continue to lag far behind other areas of diabetes research.” This proposal
addresses critical gaps in our knowledge to inform clinical guidelines for the nutritional management of type 2
diabetes in regard to macronutrient content. Some evidence indicates that reducing overall carbohydrate intake
with a very low-carbohydrate eating plan can improve glycemic control compared to eating plans with greater
carbohydrate content. However, critical knowledge gaps prevent clear recommendations: 1) a gap in
knowledge about the durability of gains in glycemic control, 2) concerns about possible long-term adverse
effects, and, 3) although current recommendations suggest individualizing recommendations about
carbohydrate content, we have almost no knowledge to guide this. To address these gaps, we propose a two-
site, parallel-group, randomized (1:1) trial with a 12-month follow-up in 180 adults with type 2 diabetes,
comparing a very low-carbohydrate diet to a moderate-carbohydrate plate-method diet—both are approaches
recommended by the ADA. Both groups will be taught previously tested behavioral strategies to maintain
adherence to nutritional treatment. Aim 1: Compare the long-term effects of the two diets on measures of
physical health: glycemic control (HbA1c, primary outcome), weight, inflammation (C-reactive protein), ability to
reduce the use of diabetes medications and medication-related costs, and diabetes-related distress over 12
months. We hypothesize that the very low-carbohydrate diet group (as compared to the moderate-
carbohydrate diet group) will have lower HbA1c and improvements in other outcomes at 12 months. Aim 2:
Compare adverse effects. Aim 3: Assess factors that identify individuals who will particularly benefit from one
of the nutritional intervention arms, including insulin resistance, body mass index, and sex. The proposed study
will address important gaps in the evidence base for the nutritional management of type 2 diabetes and has the
potential to strengthen evidence-based approaches to improve type 2 diabetes outcomes."

Cellular actin dynamics are essential in a number of key processes such as cell migration, wound healing, cell
division and endocytosis. Physiological actin dynamics arises from a complex interplay between protein
machineries that influence either the assembly of new actin structures or the disassembly of existing actin
structures. Over the last few decades, a plethora of proteins regulating actin dynamics in cells have been
identified and individually characterized. However, we still do not fully understand how these proteins work
together in multiprotein ecosystems and how they give rise to emergent behavior that cannot be predicted simply
by adding their known individual activities. Over the last few years, I have discovered several such
multicomponent activities. I showed that an enhancer (formin) and a blocker (capping protein) of actin growth
can simultaneously bind the same site on an actin filament, in the process initiating their own dynamic exchanges
at filament ends. I also accomplished the first direct microscopic demonstration of a long-predicted but never
observed acceleration of pointed-end depolymerization of actin filaments by cyclase-associated protein (CAP)
and cofilin. Over the next five years, our goal is to uncover how multicomponent biochemical signals and
mechanical signals get integrated at the scale of individual actin filaments. We will build on our ground-breaking
discoveries by investigating other proteins that we have identified, which either directly bind filament ends or via
other end-binding proteins. We will also investigate how mechanical forces alter biochemical interactions of actin
binding proteins with actin filaments. To do this, we will employ a unique combination of microfluidics-assisted
(mf-TIRF) and multispectral single molecule imaging that I have pioneered over the last few years. We will
combine biochemical and biophysical experiments with mathematical modelling. My vision is that a better
understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying actin dynamics will pave the way for development of new
therapies to combat human ailments like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), metastatic cancer, neurological
(e.g. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's diseases) and developmental disorders (e.g. limb deformities) that
are caused due to abnormalities related to actin dynamics."
10835868,"Uterine cancer is the 4th most frequent malignancy and the 6th cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the
US. While the incidence and mortality rates of some cancers, such as lung and colorectal cancers, are declining,
they are both increasing for cancers of the uterine corpus. Recent extensive integrated genomic analyses of
endometrial carcinomas have provided important insights into the repertoire of molecular aberrations
characteristic of these malignancies. They have also identified four major molecular subtypes of endometrial
carcinoma, characterized by distinct genetic alterations and clinical behavior. However, utilization of this
information is compromised because the cell(s) of origin have not been determined. By analogy with stem cells
in other organs and tissues, aberrations in mechanisms governing endometrial epithelial stem cells may lead to
a number of pathological conditions, including cancer. Unfortunately, the identity and location of endometrial
stem cells remains insufficiently elucidated.
 A number of recent studies have suggested location of stem cells either in the glandular or luminal
compartments of the mouse endometrial epithelium. In humans, such cells are commonly thought to be located
in the basalis segment of the endometrial glands. However, according to a recent single cell transcriptome study
of secretory phase human endometrium, cells showing characteristics of stem/progenitor cells are located in the
upper region of the functionalis. Other studies have suggested that endometrial epithelium can be regenerated
by stem cells of stromal/mesenchymal or bone marrow cell origin.
 Our studies performed in mice conditionally expressing fluorescent reporters in PAX8+ cells support the
hypothesis that stem cells involved in the homeostasis of endometrial epithelium are located in the epithelium
proper. By using single cell transcriptome analysis, we have identified TROP2 (encoded by Tacstd2) and FOXA2
as reliable markers of luminal and glandular compartments, respectively. Our lineage trajectory predictions,
organoid formation and lineage tracing experiments suggest that both luminal and glandular epithelium contain
stem/progenitor cells. TROP2 and FOXA2 are also differentially expressed in human endometrial epithelium.
Based on previous findings and our preliminary results we hypothesize that endometrial epithelium contains two
pools of resident stem/progenitor cells, which may have different propensities for malignant transformation,
thereby leading to clinically distinct neoplasms. To test this hypothesis, we will establish cell lineage hierarchy of
the mouse endometrial epithelium, test susceptibility of the mouse glandular and luminal epithelium to malignant
transformation associated with alterations common for serous and endometrioid carcinomas, and establish the
relevance of mouse model findings to human biology."

 Sepsis affects more than 19 million people each year. With improved treatment strategies, more and more
patients survive sepsis. The majority of these survivors develop cognitive impairment and mental health
problems. However, the mechanisms that promote sepsis-associated encephalopathies (SAE) remain largely
unknown, and there is a lack of SAE-targeted treatments. The long-term goals of our research program are to
understand the mechanisms that lead to cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment post sepsis and
to develop novel targeted treatments for sepsis-induced cognitive impairment. To reach this goal, we
characterized sepsis-induced cognitive impairment using animal models. We observed that mice exhibit
hippocampus-dependent memory impairment associated with pathological neuron dysfunction. To understand
the mechanisms behind cognitive impairment post sepsis, we focused on specialized cells in the brain called
pericytes, which play a major role in regulating cerebral blood flow and maintaining blood brain barrier integrity.
Pericytes form part of the neurovascular unit to meet the energy demands of the brain and facilitate neuro-
inflammatory responses. However, the role of pericytes in sepsis-induced cognitive impairment remains
unknown. Our studies demonstrated that the transcription factor friend leukemia virus integration 1 (Fli-1)
regulates pericyte activation and viability. We also observed that brain pericyte numbers decreased after sepsis
and that pericytes underwent apoptosis after their initial activation and production of inflammatory mediators.
Pericyte loss resulted in vascular leakage and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes. We reported previously
that Fli-1 governs pericyte viability through regulating caspase 1/3 expression. In our preliminary studies, we
demonstrated that pericyte Fli-1 knockout mice exhibit decreased inflammatory mediator production in response
to LPS. More importantly, we demonstrated that Fli-1 levels were higher in the hippocampus regions of post-
mortem brain tissue from septic patients compared to controls. In this R35/MIRA application, we propose to use
newly developed, unbiased approaches such as single nucleus RNA sequencing and imaging mass cytometry
alongside inducible pericyte-specific Fli-1 knockout mice generated in our laboratory and novel antisense
oligonucleotide Gapmers targeting Fli-1 recently developed by our group to understand the role of pericytes in
vascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment post sepsis. The successful completion of the proposed studies
will lead to better understanding of the mechanisms of vascular cognitive impairment post sepsis and the
development of novel SAE-targeted treatments."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dire prognosis mainly due to its late diagnosis. It is vital to
identify early-stage PDAC and its precursors. One such precursor is intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm
(IPMN), a type of pancreatic cyst. International consensus guidelines recommend resection of IPMN with high
malignancy risk and surveillance of IPMN without surgical indications. Based on radiologic/clinical findings, the
guidelines have a dismal specificity for discerning benign from malignant IPMN and a poor accuracy of
predicting IPMN malignant progression. It is urgent to identify biomarkers that predict malignant progression of
presumed “low-risk” IPMN. The primary objective of the proposed study is to identify and validate protein and
metabolite signatures and their longitudinal changes which can discriminate IPMN malignant progression and
detect early-stage PDAC. Supported by preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that the levels and
trajectories of such signatures in plasma and/or pancreatic cyst fluid are predictive of IPMN malignant
progression and early-stage PDAC. Specific Aims: 1. Investigate plasma and cyst fluid levels and trajectories
of proteomic biomarkers and metabolomics signatures for prediction of IPMN malignant progression in a
prospective surveillance cohort. 1A: A global proteomics and metabolomics study of pancreatic cyst fluid in
160 IPMN surgical patients will be conducted to identify proteins and metabolites associated with high-grade
and invasive IPMN. 1B: Top proteins identified from 1A and 6 proteins (THBS2, PGE2, LRG1, TIMP1, C1RL, &
PTPRJ) discovered in our preliminary studies will be measured in serial plasma (n=3) and cyst fluid (n=~2.5)
samples from 500 IPMN patients under surveillance. 1C: Top metabolites identified from 1A and 4 plasma
metabolites correlated with IPMN dysplasia grade in our R21 study will be quantified in the 1B population. The
levels and trajectories of proteins and metabolites measured in 1B and 1C will be evaluated in relation to IPMN
malignant progression. 1D: A risk prediction model for IPMN malignant progression will be built from proteins
and metabolites identified and validated in 1B and 1C, CA 19-9, and clinical/imaging features. 2. Evaluate
levels and trajectories of plasma proteomic biomarkers and metabolomics signatures for detection of early-
stage PDAC in a PRoBE-compliant case-control study nested in the PLCO cohort. 2A: proteins identified in 1A
and 6 biomarkers listed in 1B will be measured in serial prediagnostic plasma samples (n=up to 3) from 242
PDAC cases (incl. 80 early-stage cases) and 242 matched controls. 2B: In the 2A population, top metabolites
identified from 1A, 4 metabolites described in 1C, and 5 metabolites predicting early-stage PDAC in our pilot
studies will be determined. 2C: A risk prediction model for early-stage PDAC will be developed from proteins
and metabolites identified in 2A and 2B, CA 19-9, and clinical/imaging features. Our expected results will allow
clinicians to timely resect IPMNs with high malignant potential before progression to invasive cancer, while
avoiding unnecessary surgeries. Detecting early-stage PDAC will substantially increase patient survival."

Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in children and adolescents are serious health problems. Prevalence
estimates a 31% increase in T2D among people aged 10-19 years in US. A body of evidence suggests that
immune cells play an important role in obesity and T2D, and this has led to the new but fast growing field of
“immunometabolism”. Studies in humans have suggested that B cells promote inflammation in obesity and
T2D. B cells were also found in human subcutaneous adipose tissue and the function of B cells has been
shown to be impaired in obese subjects. One of the major functions of B cells is to secrete antibodies.
However, not much is known about the role of antibodies in obesity and T2D. In determining the causality
and mechanism, we will take advantage of activation-induced cytidine deaminase deficient (AID-/-) mice. In
these mice, we are able to specifically investigate the role of IgM in immune-metabolism and IgM-associated
gut bacteria in obesity, while not affecting other functions of B cells, as the B cell compartment will be intact.
Moreover, we are able to determine the early-life effects of IgG on later development of obesity. Our
preliminary data suggest that IgM accelerates obesity in mice. Transferring fecal gut microbiota, we are
able to transfer the metabolic abnormalities in AID-/- mice to wild type germ free (GF) mice in less than 2
weeks. We have also discovered that obese adolescent subjects with T2D have increased IgM-bound gut ,
which promote body weight gain and impaired glucose tolerance in GF mice. Our central hypothesis of
this project is that IgM and IgM-bound gut microbiota induce imbalance of immune-metabolism and promote
obesity and T2D. We will test the central hypothesis in mouse (Specific Aim 1) and man (Specific Aim 2), in
vitro and in vivo. We also hypothesize that the immune-pathogenic role of IgM and dysbiosis of gut
microbiota synergistically contribute to obesity, metabolic inflammation and dysregulation. We will test this
hypothesis in Specific Aim 3 using bone marrow chimeric mice and germ-free mice. Once we establish
causality and the mechanism, we will be able to design better therapy for the prevention and treatment of
childhood, as well as adult, obesity and T2D."

There is mounting concern that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experience unexpectedly high rates of
cardiac and vascular events. Identifying which patients are at highest risk for COVID-19-related cardiovascular
events and delineating how these events affect short- and long-term outcomes may help support individualized
patient care, illuminate underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and accelerate the development of effective
therapies. However, little is known about how multi-dimensional risk factors, including prior medical conditions,
socioeconomic indicators, and circulating levels of biomarkers affect patient outcomes. Building on our
team's expertise in data linkage, prediction modeling, and biomarker discovery, we will create a unique
and powerful linked data resource to characterize the biological, clinical, health system, and
socioeconomic risk factors for the development of cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and examine
their impact on health outcomes. To create this data resource, we have partnered with the American Heart
Association, whose COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is actively capturing high-quality, standardized
information on all adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at >100 U.S. sites spanning 30
states. We will link this registry to comprehensive health care claims, a national socioeconomic deprivation
index, and detailed health care system information. In Aim 1, we will apply traditional and machine learning
approaches to the linked multicenter registry in order to identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic
factors that predict in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among COVID-19 patients. In Aim
2, we will characterize long-term MACE (i.e., at 1 and 2 years after discharge from the index COVID-19
hospitalization) among older adults in a large multicenter registry linked with longitudinal Medicare claims, and
identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict their occurrence. Based on this
work, we will create clinically implementable risk scores which will estimate, at the time of admission for and
discharge from an index COVID-19 hospitalization, a patient's risk of developing a major cardiovascular event.
In Aim 3, we evaluate the proteomic profiles of a subset of patients in the linked registry with biobanked serial
blood samples, and identify biochemical markers that predict the occurrence of MACE, both during index
hospitalization for COVID-19 and after discharge. This research will advance our collective understanding of
the biological, clinical, and socioeconomic predictors of COVID-19-related cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality. By identifying patients at greatest at risk of cardiovascular events, our work will help frontline
clinicians better individualize clinical management strategies and health systems improve care delivery during
future waves of the pandemic."

10852852,"Selecting HA glycosylation for improved vaccine responses
This application responds to PA-18-859 ""Advancing Research Needed to Develop a Universal Influenza
Vaccine"" and addresses the goal to “support rational design of universal influenza vaccines”.
The low Influenza A virus (IAV) vaccine effectiveness (VE) stems from the ability of the virus to evade existing
immunity. Its error-prone polymerase enables rapid evolution of the surface glycoprotein antigens hemagglutinin
(HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Significantly, among the more prevalent mutations that occur as an IAV strain
undergoes antigenic drift is the appearance of new N-glycosylation consensus sequences (sequons) on the HA
globular domain. The appearance of new glycosites shields underlying amino acid residues from antibody
contact. However, because the host receptor binding sites (RBSs) also reside in the HA head group, variations
in head group glycosylation have the simultaneous potential to harm viral fitness by interfering with virus binding
to its host receptor.
HA glycosylation is macro- and micro-heterogeneous, meaning that each HA glycosite has a distribution of
glycoforms that differ in their physicochemical and lectin-binding properties. HA therefore consists of
heterogeneous populations that differ by glycosylation, antigenicity, and immunogenicity. Unfortunately, the
glycosylated structures of HA populations most suited for vaccine use remain unknown for IAV strains. This lack
of information results in over-reliance on genomic information that cannot predict the level of glycosylation at a
given site, the compositions of the attached glycans, and which glycosylated populations of HA are most
immunogenic.
We propose to use glycoproteomics, molecular modeling, and antigenic cartography of HA glyco-populations to
develop a detailed understanding of the relationship between HA glycosylation and immunogenicity for
representative H1N1 strains.
This study will enhance our understanding of the natural history of influenza viruses. In addition, we anticipate
that this knowledge could be employed to select HA sequences for producing recombinant influenza vaccines
with enhanced immunogenicity and VE. Unlike vaccines based on attenuated or inactivated virus, recombinant
vaccines are created synthetically and can be prepared in advance of the emergence of a seasonal or pandemic
strain of virus. Knowledge of the optimal HA glycosylation pattern would provide important guidance in
recombinant vaccine design."

Background Over 83,000 Americans will be diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2021 with over 17,000 dying of
the disease during this period. Unfortunately, both the absolute numbers of cases and deaths from bladder
cancer have increased by 57 and 41%, respectively, since 2000. When detected early (i.e., NMIBC or stage 1),
the 5-yr survival rate is >90%, compared to a significant reduction in survival if the disease is noted to be MIBC
(stage 2; 50% 5-yr survival) or metastatic (stages 3 and 4; <20% 5-yr survival). Thus, the prevailing idea is that
early detection of bladder cancer in high risk individuals (i.e., individuals exposed to certain carcinogens) will
likely be the best modality to address advanced bladder cancer’s dismal outcomes. Currently, the evaluation of
at risk individuals remains a challenge, and as such, there are no modalities available to effectively screen this
high risk population. Previously, we have a) identified a bladder cancer-associated diagnostic “signature”
comprised of 10 biomarkers, b) developed a multiplex immunoassay to query the “signature” in voided urine
samples and c) performed analytical validation of the multiplex immunoassay. Using the multiplex immunoassay,
we have generated encouraging preliminary data from a cohort of 362 subjects (46 cancers) (AUC 0.95;
sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.93, positive predictive value 0.65 and negative predictive value 0.99). Thus, for the
first time, we possess a robust assay that can be used to non-invasively detect bladder cancer. Utilizing this
assay in our ongoing prospective study surveilling patients with a history of bladder cancer, we have noted an
elevation of our ‘signature’ as early as 18 months prior to the clinical diagnosis of cancer and an actual positive
multiplex immunoassay in all cancer patients 12 months prior to the clinical diagnosis of cancer. Furthermore,
we have evidence that 9 of our 10 biomarkers within the “signature” are expressed in relevant carcinogen induced
mouse bladder cancer model. Hypothesis: A bladder cancer-associated signature exists that can be leveraged
to indicate the presence of bladder cancer from a single voided urine sample months to years prior to the clinical
presentation and diagnosis of bladder cancer. Specific Aims: 1) To perform a pilot study to evaluate the
multiplex immunoassay’s ability to early detect bladder cancer and 2) To use a relevant carcinogen induced
mouse bladder cancer model to identify early changes within the tumor microenvironment which could serve as
biomarkers candidates for testing in human samples. Significance This research will open the door for
improving on the non-invasive methods for the early detection of bladder cancer, and as such, it will have a
marked impact on patient survival. Methodology We will conduct a prospective pilot study (n=150) to
demonstrate the feasibility of identifying, following and testing high risk individuals for bladder cancer. Then
utilizing a relevant carcinogen induced mouse bladder cancer model, we will study the spatial and temporal
association of our “signature” and link it to key changes within the tumor microenvironment, identifying novel
biomarkers for future clinical development. Expected Results There exists an unmet clinical need for reliable
biomarkers to early detect bladder cancer when its more treatable with improved survival rates."

The prevalence of obesity is increasing globally, and chronic systemic and adipose tissue (AT) inflammation in
obesity contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). While several anti-inflammatory agents
have shown benefit in reducing adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, none are standard of care in obesity.
Thus, there remains a residual risk of CV events and a significant need for new therapeutics to target the
inflammation in obesity and prevent or reverse these outcomes. Furthermore, our understanding of AT
inflammation in humans is limited due to difficulty obtaining samples in clinical trials, and discoveries in animals
do not consistently translate. SLGT2 inhibitors reduce major adverse CV events through unknown
mechanism(s) and beyond what is expected from their anti-hyperglycemic or weight loss benefits. An anti-
inflammatory effect of SGLT2 inhibition has been demonstrated in animals, and if present in humans could
point to a potential mechanism for the CV benefit. Our central hypothesis is that SGLT2 inhibitors decrease
systemic and AT inflammation and result in improvements in endothelial function as a surrogate of CVD. With
a mentoring team combining expertise in clinical study design, AT immunology and endothelial measures, we
can address this scientific gap and advance our understanding of the CV benefits of SGLT2 inhibition. Our
team will enroll obese individuals with pre-diabetes and treat them with 12 weeks of an SGLT2 inhibitor or
placebo in a randomized double-blind trial. In Aim 1, we will test that SGLT2 inhibition reduces AT and
systemic inflammation by quantifying immune cell populations and transcripts. In Aim 2, we will test that
SGLT2 inhibition reduces endothelial inflammation and improves endothelial vasodilatory function. We will
assess whether changes in endothelial function are associated with changes in AT and systemic inflammation.
In Aim 3, we will interrogate the molecular effects of SGLT2 inhibition on immune and endothelial cell
interactions in vitro. Through the activities in this proposal, the candidate will (Objective 1) design and
implement a mechanistic human trial from inception to completion; (Objective 2) establish and lead a
multidisciplinary program at the intersection of immunology, AT biology and CVD; (Objective 3) develop
expertise in analyzing immune and endothelial cell interactions in vitro; and (Objective 4) gain investigative
skills in surrogate measures of CVD. These objectives will assist the candidate in achieving her long-term
career goal to lead a translational research program at the interface of immune function and vascular disease
in obesity and define new pathways for targeted interventions to prevent and treat cardiometabolic diseases.

10746854,"Abstract
 Thermogenic adipocytes and adaptive thermogenesis are promising therapeutic targets for treating and
preventing obesity and obesity-linked diabetes. We recently demonstrated that the mitochondrial tissue-
nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, TNAP, plays a crucial role in the futile creatine cycle (FCC) and adaptive
thermogenesis by hydrolyzing phosphocreatine. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of TNAP in mice
reduces systemic energy expenditure. Genetic ablation of TNAP in mice also causes rapid-onset obesity. TNAP
assumes a mitochondrial localization specifically in thermogenic adipocytes, which might ensure the cell-
selectivity of the phosphocreatine hydrolysis events and the FCC operation. Here, we propose to study the
metabolic effects of gain-of- function of TNAP in the adipose tissues in mice, as well as the molecular mechanism
and regulation of its mitochondrial localization. Using a transgenic mouse strain that artificially expresses TNAP
in the adipose tissues, we will investigate its effects on obesity, diabetes, fatty liver, and energy expenditure. To
study the TNAP localization, we will test whether its cell specificity lies in the TNAP polypeptide or its trafficking
pathway, or both. I will first determine whether there are any molecular elements (e.g., PTMs or amino acid
sequences) on the TNAP polypeptide crucial for its mitochondrial localization. This will be done using a
combination of biochemical and cell imaging approaches. In addition, we will investigate the cellular pathway of
TNAP trafficking to mitochondria. We will interrogate the role of lipid rafts in TNAP localization. This might allow
us to identify key regulators and mediators of the mitochondrial localization of TNAP. Finally, we will identify
other mitochondrial proteins that share the localization pathway of TNAP and study their functions.
 The candidate, Dr. Yizhi Sun, has a strong track record of innovative research with a focus on the molecular
mechanisms of diseases. The candidate’s career goal is to become an independent academic investigator with
a research laboratory oriented towards understanding and reversing obesity and obesity-linked metabolic
disorders. The proposed research will be conducted in the laboratory of Bruce Spiegelman, PhD at Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, who is a leader in the fields of molecular metabolism and adipocyte
biology. The proposed studies will also bring together leading laboratories of the advisory committee that have
expertise in cell imaging, protein trafficking, and mitochondrial biology. All of these, together with the ideal
research environment in the Longwood Medical Area, will maximize applicant’s potential to successfully
transition to an independent investigator."
10889028,"The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria forms a permeability barrier blocking antimicrobials from
efficiently reaching their molecular targets residing within the bacterial cell wall or inside the bacterial cytosol.
This barrier function is dependent on one of the outer membrane’s central building blocks, lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). The LPS molecule is anchored in the outer bacterial membrane by its lipid A moiety. Lipid A, an
acylated disaccharide, is sensed by the pattern recognition receptor TLR4 of the human immune system. To
avoid TLR4 sensing, bacteria evolved mechanisms to modify their lipid A structure, for example by changing
the number or lengths of its fatty acid side chains, or adding or removing terminal phosphate moieties.
However, not all LPS modifications are important for TLR4 avoidance and the biological function of many LPS
modifications is only poorly characterized.
This proposal will test the novel hypothesis that specific lipid A modifications enable bacteria to escape from
host immunity exerted by human guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1). We recently showed that GBP1 is an
additional bona fide LPS-binding protein. Intracellular GBP1 executes at least two functions: i) it accelerates
the kinetics of LPS-mediated inflammasome activation and ii) it binds directly to the surface of cytosolic Gram-
negative bacteria, where it acts as a surfactant operating synergistically with antimicrobials that need to
penetrate the bacterial outer membrane. In Aim1 we will identify specific lipid A modifications that block the
binding of GBP1 to the surface of two important human pathogens: the intracellular enteric pathogen
Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and the extracellular pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
GBP1 resides in the host cell cytosol but GBP1 is also secreted into the extracellular milieu. Secreted GBP1
can be found at high concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluids of bacterial meningitis patients.
However, the biological function of secreted GBP1 is unknown. Because we found that GBP1 binds to the
extracellular bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we will test whether and how secreted GBP1 can
exert host defense to extracellular bacteria in Aim2. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that secreted
GBP1 works synergistically with extracellular antimicrobial peptides. Conceptually related, Aim2 will also
identify extant antibiotics that operate synergistically with GBP1. Together, Aims 1 and 2 provide a roadmap
towards novel strategies for the treatment of many Gram-negative infections: targeting LPS-modifying
enzymes involved in GBP1 evasion combined with the use of antibiotics that operate synergistically with
GBP1."
10861925,"Summary
 The immune system plays an important role in protecting us from disease. Interstitial inflammation has
been consistently reported in human and animal models of ADPKD, and it may become worse during cyst
expansion which results in more damages in renal parenchyma. In addition to the increase of macrophages
in the interstitium and pericystic areas, T lymphocytes are also increased in cystic kidneys. However,
whether and how PKD mutant cystic renal epithelial cells escapes immune attacks in cystic
microenvironment during cyst initiation and expansion remains elusive. In this study, we investigate the roles
of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), a PD-1 ligand, in
ADPKD. We found that, 1) PD-1 was upregulated on T cells in Pkd1 mutant kidneys; 2) PD-L1 was
upregulated in Pkd1 mutant renal epithelial cells and tissues, and was increased in cystic cell derived
exosomes; 3) knockout of Pd-l1 delayed cyst growth and increased the survival of Pkd1 knockout mice; 4)
targeting PD1 and PD-L1 with antibodies delayed cyst growth in Pkd1 knockout kidneys; 5) treatment with
exosomes isolated from cystic renal epithelial cells and urine of ADPKD patients increased Pkd1 wild type
renal epithelial cell proliferation, and induced the activation of PKD associated signaling in these cells; 6)
treatment with cystic renal epithelial cell derived exosomes promoted cyst growth in Pkd1 mutant kidneys; 7)
renal epithelial cells (NRK-52E cells) treated with ADPKD urinary exosomes also developed cysts-like
structures in collagen gels; and 8) inhibition of exosome secretion with GW4869 delays cyst growth in Pkd1
knockout kidneys. Our central hypothesis is that upregulation of PD-L1 on cystic renal epithelial cells and
PD-1 on T cells results in immune evasion of cystic cells via inhibition of T cell function, and exosomes
secreted by cystic renal epithelial cell regulate immunosuppression via adjacent T cells and the function of
other neighboring cells, including renal epithelial cells and fibroblasts, contributing to cyst growth. We test
this hypothesis with three specific aims. This study will determine for the first time whether PD-1 and PD-L1
are immune-suppressors in cystic kidneys, which helps cystic epithelial cells to escape immune attack in
ADPKD, and whether exosomes secreted by cystic epithelial cells contribute to immune suppression and
other cellular communication. In addition, we will determine whether PD1 and PD-L1 are effective targets to
slow disease progression in preclinical setting. Accomplishing this study will lead to a better understanding
of the mechanism of immune surveillance in renal cyst formation and the roles of cystic cell exosomes in
regulating immunosuppression and other cell-to-cell communication, which will provide novel therapeutic
strategy for ADPKD treatment."
10843270,"Over 1/3 of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) who have undergone kidney or liver transplantation are
nonadherent to immunosuppressant medicine, a leading cause of organ rejection, graft failure, and death.
Despite the American Society of Transplantation's calls for real-time approaches to address immunosuppressant
nonadherence, there are no validated metrics using real-time adherence data (e.g., electronic pillboxes) to
identify those at risk for rejection and no efficacious interventions that leverage these data to improve adherence.
Hence, we will fill these critical gaps in nonadherence management by validating the new “Real-Time Adherence
Measure,” a novel instrument that could revolutionize how nonadherence is detected by linking the precision of
non-invasive, easily downloaded, timestamped electronic pillbox data to tacrolimus blood level standard
deviations (biological index of drug ingestion) to direct in the moment when immunosuppressant nonadherence
leads to rejection. We will harness this real-time daily dosing information in an adherence-promoting just-in-time
adaptive intervention (JITAI), a cutting-edge mobile health approach capable of fully incorporating AYAs' daily
electronically-monitored adherence to deliver tailored intervention content exactly when the AYA needs it most.
Currently, there are no JITAIs for this purpose. We will conduct this vital research, which involves using a micro-
randomized trial, a state-of-the-art experimental design for creating successful JITAIs. To develop our JITAI, we
will modify a promising existing intervention for promoting AYA adherence (sent adherence support messages
when dose was due) by triggering adherence support messages only when medicine is missed and providing
praise messages when medicine is taken. A JITAI-version of this intervention will be piloted with AYA kidney or
liver transplant recipients in a 12-week micro-randomized trial to identify intervention content and timing that
maximize the JITAI's impact on adherence. AYAs will be randomized after each electronically-monitored missed
tacrolimus dose to receive (1) an adherence support message or (2) no message. After each on time dose, AYAs
will be randomized to receive (1) a praise message or (2) no message. AYAs' engagement in the JITAI will be
qualitatively characterized to support long-term uptake. Our findings will address significant knowledge gaps in
how to optimally leverage technology to effectively measure and improve medication adherence for AYA kidney
or liver transplant recipients, reduce nonadherence-related rejection, graft loss, and death, and improve people's
health and quality of life. Dr. Eaton's study and training activities will prepare her to use advanced methodologies
to validate novel clinical metrics, design JITAIs, conduct micro-randomized trials, and improve mobile health
engagement. It is critical for Dr. Eaton to have support from this K23 to attain expertise in these innovative
methods and to achieve her important scientific aims. Dr. Eaton's career development activities will occur at
Johns Hopkins. Results of this study will provide essential preliminary data for Dr. Eaton's R01-supported full-
scale RCT of her JITAI and support her successful transition to become an independent investigator."

10898558,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
People living with HIV (PLWH) have significantly higher cancer incidence compared to people without HIV for
cancers caused by HPV (cervical, vulvar, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal). Altered immunity, not simply
immunodeficiency, is one proposed mechanism driving this excess risk and the significantly worse outcomes
observed following a cancer diagnosis compared to individuals without HIV. The tumor viral and immune milieu
are likely major factors contributing to these cancer disparities among PLWH. However, few studies have
examined the tumor factors (viral and immune) that underlie differences in the cancer burden by HIV
status, information needed to develop improved cancer prevention and treatment strategies for PLWH.
Currently there is no optimal method to screen for or treat HPV-related cancers among PLWH in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs), cancers that are increasing in incidence globally. Other than cervical cancer, HPV-
related cancers are understudied among PLWH in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Combination strategies of
chemoradiation and immunotherapy are transforming cancer care and increasing survival, treatments that may
also benefit PLWH. However, little is known of 1) the immune landscape of tumors that develop among PLWH
and 2) the benefit of immunotherapies to improve cancer outcomes among this population.
Our overall goal is to inform the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for HPV-related
cancers among PLWH in SSA. We will study the viral and tumor immune factors that are associated with HPV-
cancers and treatment outcomes and propose a multifaceted approach to study both the viral and immune
landscape utilizing viral and immune profiling tools and high-dimensional technologies1,2. Specifically, we will:
Aim 1: Estimate the attributable fraction of tumors caused by HPV among PLWH and HIV uninfected
patients. This aim tests the hypothesis that PLWH will have a larger diversity of HPV genotypes across all tumor
types, a higher proportion of HPV co-infections, and higher proportion of tumors with biologically active HPV
compared to HIV uninfected patients.
Aim 2: Characterize the tumor immune landscape of HPV-related cancers. This aim tests the hypothesis
that a more suppressive tumor microenvironment will be present in tumors of PLWH compared to HIV uninfected
patients and that despite a higher proportion of infiltrating CD8+ T cells, these will be terminally differentiated,
exhausted, and dysfunctional.
Aim 3: Investigate the association between HIV status and treatment outcomes for HPV-related cancers.
This aim tests the hypothesis that PLWH will have a higher mortality compared to persons without HIV and the
tumor microenvironment will be an important determinant of survival outcomes."
10898561,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
Conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is an eye cancer with unknown etiology. cSCC disproportionately
impacts Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a setting where presentation with advanced disease is common. This
translates into a high morbidity burden, as treatment of advanced cSCC includes destructive eye surgery leading
to vision loss. This can result in severe impact on household economic productivity given an average age of
cSCC diagnosis of only ~40 years. It is crucial to understand the underlying cause of this cancer to guide
development of effective early detection and management strategies to avoid this public health burden.
One of the only identified risk factors for cSCC is HIV infection. People living with HIV (PLWH) are at least 10
times more likely to be diagnosed with cSCC. Because HIV-associated immunosuppression impairs host ability
to control infections, PLWH are susceptible to cancers caused by viruses (e.g., Kaposi Sarcoma, cervical
cancer). The pronounced elevation in cSCC among PLWH suggests an infectious etiology. Existing studies have
primarily investigated cutaneous human papillomavirus (HPV) types as potential contributors to cSCC; however,
IARC considers cutaneous HPV as non-causal for cancer. Emerging data, including our preliminary findings,
suggest a potential role for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in cSCC. Our overall goal is to determine if EBV contributes
to cSCC in PLWH. We propose to test the EBV hypothesis among 800 participants from Parirenyatwa Hospital-
Sekuru Kaguvi Eye Unit (SKEU) in Harare, Zimbabwe. These 800 patients will be leveraged to accomplish the
following study aims:
Aim 1: Compare EBV DNA detection and RNA expression in malignant versus benign conjunctival tissue
in PLWH. This aim will test the hypothesis that PLWH with invasive cSCC will have 1) higher prevalence of EBV
detection and 2) higher EBV expression compared to PLWH with benign eye lesions.
Aim 2: Estimate the prevalence of an altered immune response, as measured using an EBV antibody
panel, in PLWH with cSCC compared to cancer-free controls. This aim will test the hypothesis that PLWH
with invasive cSCC (cases) will have a higher EBV antibody score than PLWH without eye lesions (controls).
Aim 3: Estimate the association between HIV status and cSCC clinical outcome. This aim will test the
hypothesis that PLWH and cSCC will have poorer survival after cSCC diagnosis compared to cases without HIV.
Exploratory Aim. We will characterize tumors from ~100 cSCC cases (50 with and 50 without HIV) as immune
infiltrated or immune excluded based on presence of T-cells and assess quantity and spatial pattern of T-cells,
immune checkpoint expression, and markers of immune exhaustion by HIV status."

translational research projects and any pilot projects awarded through the Developmental Core.
Aim 3: Educate and train investigators at PAVILION LMIC partnering sites on biostatistical methods and
resources needed for large scale epidemiological studies This aim provides hands on mentorship of two
early career biostatisticians in South Africa and Zimbabwe to expand regional capacity in the rigorous design
and reproducible conduct of broad scale clinical and epidemiological studies in sub-Saharan Africa."
10839981,"Summary
Heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States. Although the
incidence of cardiovascular disease deaths has declined, it still accounts for ~1 out of every 3
deaths. Coronary artery disease (CAD) due to atherosclerosis was responsible for most of these
deaths. Despite increased knowledge about CAD risk factors and the availably of drugs to treat
them, the CAD problem has not been solved. Large human genome wide association studies
have identified many common genetic variants associated with CAD, but only a small fraction of
the heritable risk has been discovered. This proposal aims to perform mouse genetic and
genomic studies to identify atherosclerosis modifier genes and genetic modifiers of macrophage
foam cell lipid droplet metabolism and inflammation, yielding insights into the mechanisms that
regulate these pathways. The first aim of the proposed studies involves identifying the
responsible genes and genetic variation that give rise to in vitro macrophage phenotypes using
sophisticated genetic and gene editing approaches. The second aim of the proposed studies is
to identify the mouse atherosclerosis modifier gene in a genetic locus identified on chromosome
2. This aim will use sophisticated gene editing as well as a newer mouse model of
atherosclerosis induced by treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide targeting the low density
lipoprotein receptor. These findings may lead to novel drug targets and therapies to prevent or
treat CAD. The relevance of the proposed studies is that they address a significant health
concern, coronary artery disease, and will yield insight into the mechanisms that modify
atherosclerosis susceptibility. The discovery of novel pathways and proteins that regulate
atherosclerosis and foam cell cholesterol metabolism and inflammation offers hope for new
modes of risk assessment, prevention, and therapy."
10846642,"We will expand our active study of older adults and recruit a parallel cohort of middle age adults to begin
novel investigations of less-studied, modifiable, midlife determinants of later life cognitive impairment.
Studying cognitive changes in middle adulthood (ages 40-64) could elucidate modifiable factors that might
prevent later life cognitive impairment. Very few cognitive aging studies to date include this age group. Those
that have are limited to small or condition-specific samples, cross-sectional analyses or cohort studies with few
follow-up periods, abbreviated cognitive tests, limited covariates, or a lack of diversity in study samples. But
many known factors for cognitive impairment manifest in middle age: 1) chronic conditions that often are delayed
in their detection, or inadequately managed due to poor treatment adherence; 2) undetected or uncorrected
sensory impairments; 3) entrenched lifestyle behaviors; and 4) common biological and psychosocial stressors.
Thus, greater attention is being paid to proper health self-management and routine healthcare engagement in
midlife. Yet many U.S. adults may reach middle age lacking proficient `health literacy'; the capacity to gather
accurate self-care knowledge, make informed health decisions, enact recommended behaviors and
appropriately use health services. Health literacy is modifiable, by enhancing health knowledge and self-care
skills, but also by reducing treatment burden imparted by health systems. Promoting health literacy could improve
self-management, increase routine healthcare use and modify lifestyle; thus reducing risk of later life impairment.
Since 2007, we have examined how cognitive decline affects health literacy, self-management skills, and health
(R01AG030611) among older adults. Our active `LitCog' study has shown how cognitive function affects health
literacy, self-management, and health in older age. But in midlife, limited health literacy and self-management
skills may lead to unhealthy lifestyle, chronic disease, and poorly managed health due to infrequent healthcare
use and poor treatment adherence - increasing risk of cognitive impairment. Our 2020 LitCog renewal adds a
5th, 6th follow-up interview. We seek to initiate a parallel, middle age cohort (`MidCog'; ages 40-64; N=1200),
conducting the first two assessments 2.5 years apart. Our specific aims are to: 1) Characterize health literacy,
self-management skills, and cognitive function in detail among middle age adults; 2) Evaluate associations
between health literacy, self-management skills, health behaviors, healthcare use, health status, chronic disease
outcomes and cognitive function over time; 3) Investigate whether certain modifiable, psychosocial, midlife
factors moderate associations between health literacy, self-management skills, health status and cognition; and
4) Using MidCog + LitCog data, explore associations between age, health literacy, self-management skills, health
status, presence & management of chronic disease, and cognitive function among adults ages 40 to 90. We will
complement existing midlife research & inform health system strategies to preserve cognitive function."
10845698,"Alzheimer’s disease, a severe progressive neurodegenerative disease of aging and the most common form of
dementia, affects an estimated 30 million people worldwide. Pathologically, Alzheimer’s disease is defined by
the presence of both amyloid plaques comprised of the protein amyloid-β (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles
containing the protein tau in disease affected brain regions. However, 30-57% of Alzheimer’s disease patients
also exhibit TDP-43 aggregates as an additional co-pathology. The presence of TDP-43 pathology in
Alzheimer’s disease correlates with hippocampal sclerosis, worse brain atrophy, more severe cognitive
impairment, and more rapid cognitive decline. Given the recent recognition of TDP-43 as a frequent co-
pathology in Alzheimer’s disease, understanding its contribution to neurodegenerative disease processes and
potential synergies with other pathological disease-promoting proteins is a critical need in the field. Recent
work using C. elegans found that co-expressed tau and TDP-43 leads to increased neurotoxicity and
pathological protein accumulation. Building on this foundation, the proposed Aims will develop and utilize new
tractable models of co-expressed tau and TDP-43 in order to understand the biology underlying their toxicity.
Aim 1 will define consequences of low or regulatable levels of co-expressed tau and TDP-43 using behavioral
and neuroimaging assays, and test relationships between tau and TDP-43. Aims 2 and 3 will employ RNA
sequencing to reveal gene expression underlying comorbid tau and TDP-43 through aging in simple models,
and in human post-mortem brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer’s disease with TDP-43 pathology.
Candidates nominated from transcriptomic approaches will be tested for functional roles in tau and TDP-43
synergistic proteinopathy using genetic and transgenic approaches. This work will characterize mechanisms
underlying tau and TDP-43 neurotoxicity in Alzheimer’s disease and identify new therapeutic targets and
strategies. Completion of this project will significantly advance understanding Alzheimer’s disease with
comorbid TDP-43, and provide the groundwork for future therapeutic development targeting TDP-43 in
Alzheimer’s disease."

impact
in germline RUNX1 mutation carriers:
of inflammation and the bone marrow niche
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Germline variants that confer risk for leukemia have been recognized increasingly with 15-20% of acute
leukemia patients having at least 1 first-degree relative afflicted with leukemia. Germline variants are now
included for the first time in the revised leukemia classification scheme outlined by the World Health
Organization, and new clinical guidelines now include testing for inherited susceptibility as a critical element of
patient diagnostics. It is devastating for these patients and their family members to live with the knowledge of
having increased risk for developing cancer in their lifetimes. Thus, for these patients, early cancer detection,
disease monitoring, and prevention would be life-changing, but require a comprehensive understanding of
molecular changes that occur prior to overt leukemia. The long-term goal of this study is to identify the
mechanisms that regulate hematopoiesis at the premalignant stage in patients with germline RUNX1 mutations
[also called familial platelet disorder (FPD)]. These individuals have life-long thrombocytopenia, qualitative
platelet aggregation defects, and a risk of developing a variety of hematopoietic malignancies. The acquisition
of secondary mutations occurs over time in FPD patients leading to leukemia development. However, the
intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors that render pre-leukemic cells vulnerable to acquire secondary mutations are
unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we performed single-cell transcriptome profiling of primary FPD bone
marrow samples and identified unique transcriptional changes in FPD progenitors compared to healthy
controls. Consistent these changes, FPD progenitors have impaired megakaryocytic but enhanced myeloid
differentiation. Cytokine profiling of bone marrow hematopoietic and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) show
that there is increased cytokine production within the bone marrow, leading to chronic inflammatory stress,
which may confer a growth advantage to FPD progenitors. Moreover, FPD stromal cells also show defective
differentiation, clonogenic capacity, and deregulated gene expression that may further promote an
inflammatory state. Thus, we hypothesize that early transcriptomic changes in FPD stem/progenitors
cooperate with inflammatory microenvironmental signals to provide a growth advantage to these pre-leukemic
cells and alter their differentiation. Wewill test our hypothesis using the following aims: 1)Identify how early
transcriptomic changes alter hematopoiesis of FPD cells. 2) Determine the impact of inflammatory cytokines
and their blockade in FPD evolution. 3) Assess the role of the FPD stromal microenvironment on growth and
differentiation of FPD and healthy stem/progenitors. To achieve our goals, we have assembled several tools,
including primary stem/progenitor/and stromal cells, iPSCs, xenograft and transgenic mouse models,
CRISPR/Cas9
hematopoiesis
targeting
and
editing technique, and 3D co-culture models. This project will advance our understanding of
in FPD patients and will provide the molecular basis for the rational design of new therapeutics
 of RUNX1-mediated changes and the inflammatory microenvironment to normalize hematopoiesis
delay or prevent leukemia in FPD patients."
10866605,"Project Summary/Abstract
The mission of the Tetrad program is to transform a group of bright, motivated, and diverse trainees into
independent, innovative, and rigorous leaders in academic science, biotechnology, and affiliated disciplines. Our
mission requires balancing disciplinary specialization, which is essential for depth and rigor, with the flexibility to
think broadly across disciplines, which drives scientific breakthroughs. Towards this goal, the Tetrad program
provides training in the fundamental principles of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry and the use of these
principles to practice the scientific method across disciplines and with rigor. The approaches and concepts in
these areas are applicable to nearly every aspect of modern biology. Therefore, we believe that by building a
solid foundation in these core areas, we can best equip our trainees for the fast pace of biomedical discovery
and the expanding landscape of science related career options. Thus, our training does not get obsolete with
new technological innovations or changing biological paradigms, but instead contributes to driving such
breakthroughs by empowering students to engage in curiosity driven research. The emphasis on fundamental
principles is complemented with exposure to cutting-edge biomedical findings and techniques to increase our
students’ curiosity and foster their ability to tackle questions of broad significance. Our mission also requires
training in essential professional skills, such as effective and accurate communication of science, an ability to
work in diverse teams and an ability to identify a productive career path. Therefore, training activities such as
proposal writing courses and career development workshops are woven throughout the program. Finally, our
mission requires that efforts to diversify the biomedical workforce do not rely simply on increased recruitment of
underrepresented students, but also depend on efforts to ensure their continued success. Therefore, activities
such as training our program faculty to mentor across differences are essential program components.
The broad range of scientific problems studied by the 79 training faculty and their strong commitment to graduate
training has enabled Tetrad to provide an environment that nurtures the excitement and curiosity that lies at the
heart of doing science and empowers all our trainees to be impactful members of the biomedical workforce. We
plan on appointing 13 students for a duration of 2 years. Therefore, we request a total of 26 annual slots as we
anticipate that each year, we will have 13 first year students and 13 second year students on this training grant.
Trainees will be chosen from a highly qualified pool of students."
10839318,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inflammasomes detect intracellular danger-associated signals and trigger an inflammatory form of cell death
called pyroptosis. The danger signals that the related NLRP1 and CARD8 inflammasomes sense are unknown
and represent a major knowledge gap. Interestingly, small-molecule inhibitors of the serine proteases DPP8
and DPP9 (DPP8/9) were recently discovered to induce a danger signal that activates the NLRP1 and CARD8
inflammasomes. However, DPP8/9 inhibitors, in contrast to other inflammasome activators, induce pyroptosis
in only a fraction of sensitive cells over relatively long time periods. Thus, it is possible that the co-occurrence
of a second danger signal with DPP8/9 inhibition is required for full and rapid NLRP1 and CARD8 activation.
The central hypothesis of this application is that a lack of reactive oxygen species, or reductive stress, is the
second danger signal required to fully activate these inflammasomes. This hypothesis has been formulated on
the basis of preliminary data produced in the applicant’s laboratory and described in the application. The long-
term goal of this project is to understand why reductive stress is a danger signal that is closely monitored by
the innate immune system. The immediate objective of this application is to determine the molecular
mechanism by which reductive stress activates the NLRP1 and CARD8 inflammasomes. This project consists
of three specific aims: 1) to characterize the impact of oxidants and antioxidants on NLRP1 and CARD8
activation; 2) to determine the mechanism of GPX1-mediated NLRP1 and CARD8 inactivation; and 3) to
determine how TRX1 modulates NLRP1 activation. Successful completion of this project will fill a critical
knowledge gap by showing that reductive stress is a key danger signal that activates the NLRP1 and CARD8
inflammasomes. Overall, this work holds tremendous promise to reveal a fundamental new connection

harnessed for therapeutic benefit."

Late diagnosis of HIV is a significant public health problem due to increased risk for morbidity and mortality and
the potential for HIV transmission. This Kirschstein NRSA Predoctoral Fellowship (PA-21-051) proposal aims
to conduct an interdisciplinary multiphase explanatory sequential mixed-methods study to better understand
the social-ecological factors associated with late HIV diagnosis, examine longitudinal HIV health outcomes
(e.g., CD4 count and viremia), identify facilitators/barriers to HIV testing and healthcare engagement, and
understand the impact of alcohol. This proposal responds to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy to identify missed
opportunities for diagnosis, the Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative to reduce late diagnosis, and the National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)’s Strategic Plan to understand how alcohol affects HIV
disease progression. Recent literature investigating factors associated with late is limited in United States
populations. Moreover, there is not a consensus on the clinical definition of late diagnosis; common definitions
are “traditional” CD4 count<200 cells/mm3 and “expanded” CD4 from 200 cells/mm3 up to 350 cells/mm3,
though no studies to date have compared these definitions by significant covariates or longitudinal outcomes.
The effect of alcohol is also understudied despite known associations with worse health and care engagement.
To achieve the goals of this study, we will link two statewide datasets of people with HIV (PWH) in Florida:
Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) and Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System (eHARS) data collected
between 2015-and 2019 (N=2,000). First, we will determine the incidence and describe demographic,
behavioral, and psychosocial disparities between those with and without multiple definitions (traditional vs
expanded) of late HIV diagnosis. Second, we will create generalized linear mixed effect models to compare
longitudinal outcomes by late diagnosis and assess potential effect modification of heavy alcohol; we will use a
subset of this data including only those diagnosed between 2015-and 2019 (N=200). Finally, we will explore
reasons for late diagnosis, identify missed opportunities for testing, and determine new intervention points
through qualitative interviews with 20-25 PWH with late HIV diagnosis in the Southern HIV and Alcohol
Research Consortium (SHARC) contact registry (N=750). Findings will inform intervention and policy targets
to reduce late diagnosis by identifying health disparities and missed opportunities for testing and healthcare
engagement. A benefit of this award is training to establish the foundation of a successful career in
epidemiologic research and intervention science such as 1) learning strengths, limitations, and implications of
using multidimensional public health data to measure substance use and health outcomes; (2) understand the
rationale for using different statistical methods to answer longitudinal research questions with public health
data; and (3) leading collection and analysis of qualitative data as part of a mixed-methods study, in addition to
developing skills such as manuscript production and giving presentations."
10862719,"Background. Differentiated service delivery (DSD) for HIV care, an approach to better serve clinical and social
needs among people living with HIV (PLWH), has been adopted to improve adherence and retention in care.
The current DSD programs include four different categories (within-facility individual, out-of-facility individual,
provider-managed group, client-managed group). Studies have so far shown mixed results of DSD relative to
conventional ART delivery. In 2021, the World Health Organization revised its guideline to expand DSD to offer
more individualized HIV services to all PLWH. Currently, DSD individualization is often based on clinical
stability or availability of human resources, rather than patient preferences and needs. As countries expand
DSD, preference-based individualization of DSD could improve health outcomes and quality of life. This K01
provides a unique opportunity to address these research gaps.
Candidate Overview. My long-term career objective is to become an independent investigator who specializes
in incorporating patient-centeredness into health programs for PLWH in low- and middle-income countries.
While I have developed research skills in epidemiology, statistical methods, discrete choice experiments and
preference assessment, this K01 award will provide the necessary additional training and experience to be an
independent investigator in the design and evaluation of patient-centered health programs to improve clinical
outcomes and quality of life among PLWH and inform policy decision-making.
Career Development and Training Plan. My educational program includes structured coursework,
professional conferences, directed readings, and a research project with specific aims timed to coincide with
these activities. My mentorship team includes international experts who specialize in areas related to my
training goals: Dr. Scott Braithwaite (decision science and comparative effectiveness), Dr. Anna Bershteyn
(agent-based mathematical modeling), Dr Carolyn Berry (qualitative research), Dr. Elvin Geng (implementation
science), and Dr. Elizabeth Bukusi (study execution and dissemination in Kenya).
Environment. NYU School of Medicine provides an exceptional environment to conduct the proposed study,
obtain additional training and mentorship, and successfully transition to an independent investigator.
Research Strategy. My study will evaluate the impact of preference-concordant programs on patient and
population outcomes using a prospective cohort study and mathematical modeling in western Kenya.
Specifically, the study will: 1) measure the trade-offs that patients are willing to make among different features
of DSD programs and how these preferences vary by patient characteristics; 2) determine how preference-
concordant DSD programs impact retention, adherence, and viral load suppression; 3) estimate the long-term
health impact and costs of preference-concordant DSD programs using mathematical modeling."
10873778,"This predoctoral research training program focuses on transdisciplinary training of future behavioral scientists
organized around research concepts and methods at the interface of behavioral and biomedical domains. The
program's cross-cutting theme emphasizes translational sciences, accentuates facets of prevention science,
and engages both human and animal-model approaches to research. The predoctoral Behavioral-Biomedical
Interface Program (BBIP) stems from NIGMS's “Interface of the Behavioral and Biomedical Sciences” initiative.
BBIP engages trainees from three disciplinary units that are heavily involved in the behavioral sciences:
epidemiology, exercise science, and psychology. The behavioral and biomedical sciences faculty mentors and
BBIP trainees are working on health-related research problems linked for example to cancer, cardiovascular
health, children's behavioral and social-emotional health, diabetes, HIV, obesity and physical activity in
childhood and adulthood, stroke and brain injury, and substance abuse, as well as cross-content foci such as
implementation science, reduction of health disparities, addressing healthcare access and equity, and .
Providing the cross-disciplinary training are faculty mentors, laboratory hosts, program leaders, and course
instructors who bring to bear a broad array of disciplines and research areas such as epidemiology and related
public health areas, exercise science, genetics, geriatrics, environmental health sciences, neuroscience,
prevention science, psychology, and quantitative methods/biostatistics. BBIP training includes coursework,
integrated with doctoral degree curricula, in neuroscience, genetics, translational science, prevention science,
responsible conduct of research, methods to enhance rigor and reproducibility, and advanced statistical and
design methods. Trainees participate in two laboratory rotations exposing trainees to a variety of research
methods and perspectives, and take a behavioral-biomedical interface seminar course. All trainees immerse
themselves in mentored research throughout training. A Topic Sessions Series, taking place in BBIP's third
and fourth years, addresses scientific, methodological, career and professional development, and scientific
integrity topics. The program aims to foster a positive multi-disciplinary climate, encourage advanced
quantitative/statistical skill development, and inspire dissertation research informed by behavioral-biomedical
interface issues. This training program, which runs parallel to each trainee's discipline-specific doctoral degree
program, is designed to build capacity with respect to behavioral scientists who are sufficiently exposed to the
biomedical sciences to effectively contribute to multi-disciplinary teams engaged in research aimed at
understanding and preventing significant health disorders and conditions, and promoting positive health
outcomes."

Women living with HIV may have a unique, but currently ill-defined inflammatory response to chronic HIV
infection. Despite generally having lower viral loads then men living with HIV, women living with HIV lose CD4+
T cells at approximately twice the rate of men and experience high rates of non-AIDS comorbidities. As a result
of this ongoing immune activation and inflammation, even in the setting of effective antiretroviral therapy, AIDS-
related illnesses are among the leading causes of death of women of reproductive age, worldwide. Thus, one of
the key questions in basic HIV research is not only how the inflammatory cytokine profile of treated HIV+
individuals differs from the general population, but also how these inflammatory profiles are different for women
living with HIV as compared to men living with HIV. When performing these analyses, it will be critical to also
consider participation in receptive anal intercourse. Though it has been established that receptive anal
intercourse influences the gut mucosal environment in cohorts of men, this sexual behavior is rarely considered
in analyses among women. In this study, we will focus on defining both sex-specific and sexual behavior-specific
patterns of systemic and gut inflammation in treated HIV infection, and elucidating the microbial and molecular
mechanisms driving these inflammatory signatures. This will be performed in carefully matched populations,
considering factors known to influence circulating inflammatory marker concentrations, such as BMI, and timing
of menstruation in women.
In Aim 1, we will quantify inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, effector molecules, gut permeability markers, and
monocyte activation markers within the plasma and rectal mucosal secretions of men and women living with HIV
on ART, as well as uninfected individuals. We will also quantify persistent HIV replication within gut tissue and
perform bulk and spatial transcriptomics of rectal biopsies to begin to mechanistically define the molecular
pathways contributing to chronic inflammation within the gut. Due to the known influence of receptive anal
intercourse on the gut microbiome, in Aim 2, we will strategically consider sexual activity, and quantify the
diversity and composition of gut microbiota of the same participants enrolled in Aim 1. Thus, we seek to define
optimal composition of microbiota associated with reduced systemic and gut inflammation, in a sex- and sex
behavior-specific manner. In Aim 3, we will utilize the rectal explant challenge model to infect rectal biopsies
donated by women and men, ex vivo, under ahormonal conditions, or supplemented estrogen at biologically
relevant “low” or “high” concentrations. This will allow us to directly examine i) early sex-specific, tissue-specific
inflammatory cytokine responses to HIV infection, and ii) determine how estrogen can influence these early
responses. Performing these multi-dimensional analyses in parallel will facilitate identification of sex-specific
patterns of inflammation in response to HIV infection, and thereby the development appropriate interventions for
mitigating this inflammation."
10837730,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Enzymes are remarkable nanomachines that play a myriad of essential functions in cellular metabolism.
Modulation of enzyme structure and flexibility by cofactor/substrate binding provides an important source of
regulation of enzyme function, yet our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms by which concerted protein
motion facilitate enzymatic activity is still largely incomplete. Indeed, while several studies have appeared in the
past two decades describing how conformational dynamics mediate the biological function of small proteins, our
understanding of how the coupling among multiple conformational equilibria determines the activity of large
multidomain systems continues to lag. The overall goal of this proposal is using and developing integrated
approaches combining NMR with complementary biophysical and biochemical tools to reveal how modulation of
local disorder upon cofactor/substrate binding affects concerted motions and regulates the activity of high
molecular weight enzymes that are essential for human and bacterial metabolism. This combination of tools
sensitive to protein motion brings a newly detailed picture of high molecular weight enzyme function. The
enzymes characterized in this proposal are Enzyme I (EI) of the bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS),
and the AlkB family of nucleic acid demethylases – together these distinct classes of enzymes show how the
relationship between local disorder and concerted domain motions can be probed by this combination of tools
and demonstrate how essential these mechanisms are across diverse enzyme classes. In particular, the EI
enzymatic activity depends upon the synergistic action of four conformational equilibria that results in a series of
large intradomain, interdomain, and intersubunit structural rearrangements modulated by substrate binding.
Therefore, our efforts to uncover EI function at atomic level will reveal how modulation of local disorder mediates
long-range interdomain communication and, ultimately, regulates the activity of this essential bacterial enzyme.
The AlkB dioxygenases are flexible enzymes that are known to undergo modulation of their internal dynamics
upon substrate binding. Our studies will visualize conformational disorder in apo and holo AlkB enzymes with
unprecedented atomic-resolution details, and will reveal how residual disorder at the active site determines
substrate selectivity. In addition, we will investigate a number of complexes formed by AlkB proteins with their
inhibitors. We expect these results to indicate new strategies, based on selective perturbation of conformational
disorder, to develop AlkB inhibitors with subfamily selectivity. In summary, my research program will elucidate
the coupling between large scale conformational changes and function in two distinct classes of high molecular
weight multidomain enzymes, providing new insights for future therapies for obesity and cancer as well as novel
antibiotic targets. Moreover, these efforts pushing the frontier of the application of biophysical tools to study with
atomic resolution the relationship between disorder and functional concerted motions in complex enzymes
provide a template transferrable to mechanistic investigations of uncharted multi-domain systems."

The central goal of the Schumacher lab is to deduce molecular principles governing fundamental biological
processes involving protein-nucleic acid interactions. These investigations focus on processes in microbes and
intersect with the lab’s interests in microbial pathogenesis. Indeed, while the main goal is to elucidate biological
mechanisms at the atomic level, these studies also provide potential targets for the development of urgently
needed antimicrobial agents. Alarmingly, recent estimates suggest that deaths from antimicrobial resistance
bacteria may exceed 10 million deaths worldwide by 2050 if steps are not taken to generate new treatments.
The specific processes we investigate include transcription, DNA organization and RNA editing. Bacteria must
be able to sense and respond to environmental changes for their survival and in some cases, proper
development, so our studies on transcription focus on important networks and address how environmental
cues are signaled and detected by transcription switches. Streptomyces bacteria represent the main source of
antibacterial and other key drugs, which they generate concomitant with development. Thus, understanding
their developmental lifecycle has been of significant interest for decades, although it is a mystery what drives
this process. Our studies in the last few years have revealed that this developmental switch is controlled by the
second messenger, c-di-GMP, functioning through two global transcription regulators, BldD and WhiG. These
regulators control the first and second steps in Streptomyces development, respectively, but how c-di-GMP
levels are sensed and signaled to these regulators are unknown and is a question we will address in this
proposal. Initial studies unveiled a possible link between WhiG and a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, possibly
indicating colocalization as a mechanism to control the second developmental step, which we will investigate.
Studies will also be performed to analyze c-di-GMP levels and identify and characterize additional c-di-GMP
modulated developmental regulators. Using a combination of cryo-EM, biochemistry and in vivo studies, we will
also dissect the molecular mechanism by which nitrogen levels are sensed in Gram-positive bacteria by the
novel Glutamine Synthetase-GlnR signaling pathway whereby the central enzyme for a metabolic pathway
(GS) directly transduces nutrient availability to its master transcription regulator (GlnR). Finally, we will
elucidate the signal and mechanism behind the first SOS-independent DNA repair pathway in bacteria.
Another focus of the lab is the unusual RNA editing process in the mitochondria of kinetoplastid parasitic
protozoans called kinetoplastid RNA (kRNA) editing. A recently identified accessory complex, the MRB1
complex, is required for this process. However, the structure and mechanisms of action of this complex are
completely unknown. We will obtain structures of this complex and dissect its various molecular functions in
editing. These combined studies will elucidate fundamental biological processes at the molecular level, leading
to the discovery of potential chemotherapeutic targets against microbial diseases."
10919758,"Oxidative stress is a prevalent and dangerous cellular condition resulting in deleterious modifications to the
structure of DNA. These modifications promote mutagenesis and consequently the development of numerous
human maladies, including cancer. The base excision repair (BER) pathway is the cells primary defense against
oxidative DNA damage and is a vital guardian of genome stability. While the roles of individual enzymes during
a classical BER cycle are largely established, it remains enigmatic how these enzymes function together in a
multi-protein/DNA complex to facilitate the channeling of toxic DNA repair intermediates between each protein.
Importantly, BER not only occurs on naked duplex DNA, but also within chromatin that is composed of
nucleosomes. These nucleosomes present a barrier to BER enzymes accessing and effectively repairing DNA
damage. The mechanisms by which DNA repair proteins overcome this barrier to repair DNA damage in the
nucleosome is poorly understood. The major goals of this proposal are to understand the molecular mechanisms
of each BER factor both individually and within larger multi-protein/DNA complexes using naked duplex DNA
and chromatin; and to decipher the molecular mechanism by which telomerase replicates the telomere. Elegant
biophysical approaches are required to elucidate these BER complexities and to provide both a foundation for
interpreting the biological response and the development of therapeutic treatments. We are in a unique position
to advance this scientific front based on my strong track record in DNA damage and repair, assembled team of
collaborators, and multidisciplinary approach. To meet this goal, we utilize a comprehensive approach of time-
lapse X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamic simulations, enzyme kinetics, single-molecule total internal
reflection microscopy, and cryo-EM. Using these methodologies, we will determine 1) how do new fundamental
mechanistic steps alter the DNA polymerase and telomerase mechanism; 2) how do individual BER enzymes
assemble into a multi-protein/DNA complex to facilitate the channeling of toxic DNA intermediates; 3) how are
multi-protein/DNA BER complexes structurally organized; 4) how is DNA damage identified and repaired within
nucleosomes; and 5) how are multi-protein/DNA BER complexes formed on nucleosomes containing DNA
damage. This set of questions will go from an atomic level mechanistic understanding of key BER components
to the structural and dynamic interactions within the entire BER multi-protein complex. By doing this, we will lay
the foundation to address an inherent challenge in establishing cellular models and developing new therapeutic
treatments that target DNA repair. With this information in hand, we will be closer to our long-term goal of
providing a basis for rational drug design towards the development of more effective chemotherapeutics and
synergistic drug combinations that target proteins involved in the DNA damage response."
10810774,"SUMMARY
Revealing the key events that specify the first differentiated cell lineages during mammalian development is key
to understand how the early embryo is organized to implant in the uterus and establish a pregnancy. The first
mammalian cell lineages comprise the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) that will form the fetus, and the outer
trophectoderm that will form the placenta. Yet, the mechanisms explaining how these lineages differentiate are
unclear. In many non-mammalian embryos, asymmetrically inherited cell-fate determinants specify lineage fate,
yet similar mechanisms are thought to be absent during early mammalian development.
We have established live-imaging approaches to study cell and molecular dynamics during early mouse
development. Recently, we identified a new role for intermediate filaments assembled by keratins in lineage
specification. Our studies reveal that keratin filaments are asymmetrically inherited precisely during the cell
divisions that physically segregate the future ICM and trophectoderm. Moreover, the inheritance of these
filaments by the outer daughter cells helps to specify their trophectoderm identity and promote their maturation.
Thus, our main hypothesis is that keratin filaments function as a new form of asymmetrically inherited factor
specifying the first trophectoderm cells during development. To test this, we will reveal the mechanisms by which
keratins become asymmetrically inherited (Aim 1) and can bias cell fate (Aim 2).
We will first test how interactions with proteins present at the apical cell cortex, and the dynamics of the filaments
inside the cell, control their asymmetric inheritance by outer cells during cell division. We will then determine how
keratins can regulate key aspects of cell mechanics and polarity to control the distribution of the key transcription
factors that specify trophectoderm fate.
In summary, in this proposal we will address a fundamental open question about the specification of the first
differentiated cell lineages during mammalian development, and unveil some of the first functions of keratin
intermediated filaments during early mammalian development, which unlike those of other cytoskeletal elements
like microtubules and actin, remain largely unknown."
10871860,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding how proteins interact within the cell to perform specific functions is a major goal of modern
biology, and vital for understanding the diverse roles these molecules play in biomedicine. Cryo-electron
tomography (cryo-ET) combined with sub-volume averaging (SVA) is currently the only imaging technology that
allows imaging macromolecules within their unperturbed native environment at nanometer resolutions. Most
successful studies, however, have been of large complexes or supramolecular assemblies, and at resolutions
that are too low to reveal molecular level interactions. The overall objective of this Technology Development
project is to design computational tools to improve the resolution of cryo-ET/SVA and extend its applicability to
a wider class of biomedically relevant targets. The specific aims are: (1) we will develop strategies to improve
the accuracy of the tilted contrast transfer function determination from low-dose tomographic projections, (2) we
will design algorithms to improve the accuracy of sub-volume alignment, reconstruction and classification aimed
at reducing the computational B-factors associated with data processing, and (3) we will optimize imaging and
data processing parameters to enable high-resolution studies of a wider class of targets including small
complexes. As proof of principle, we implemented a first-generation prototype of our platform and tested it on
monodisperse samples imaged by cryo-ET. The preliminary results demonstrate that our platform: (1) improves
the state-of-the-art in terms of achievable resolution, and (2) can be used to determine the structure of a 300kDa
enzyme at 3.9 Å resolution, representing a ground-breaking achievement for the field. Our research is innovative
because it seeks to overcome fundamental technical challenges in cryo-ET needed to realize the full potential of
this emerging imaging technology. The proposal is significant because it will be the first demonstration that low-
molecular weight targets can be imaged at near-atomic resolution using cryo-ET, indicating that this technique
is the most promising route for imaging important biomolecules in-situ. Ultimately, by closing the “resolution gap”
between strategies for studying monodisperse samples at high-resolution (X-ray, NMR and single-particle cryo-
EM) and techniques to study proteins in their native environments, our methods will allow the visualization of
protein complexes in their functional state at unprecedented levels of detail."

Our goal is to understand early vertebrate development at the molecular level. We study the problem in the frog
Xenopus, whose abundant eggs are large and readily manipulated by microinjection and microsurgery. The
embryos are large enough to produce material for biochemical and proteomic analysis, and are also ideal for
imaging whole embryo morphogenesis, and confocal imaging of explants.
During previous grant periods, we have identified potent signaling and signal transduction activities that
contribute to embryonic development, neural induction and anterior-posterior patterning of the neural plate. In
parallel we improved genome assemblies and annotation for X. tropicalis and X. laevis, enabling a systems level
approach. These, and new assemblies for other frogs, not only provide the resources necessary for hypothesis
driven research for the community, but also delivered new insights into genome structures, recombination and
evolution.
In the next grant period, we focus on the genes that control cell shape changes, and tissue level movements in
the embryo, focusing on gastrulation and neurulation. Based on the premise that Rho GTP Exchange Factors
(GEFs) are often deployed selectively to mediate specific cell behaviors, we will continue our analysis of
members of the Plekhg family, among which three of seven show specific morphogenetic defects after CRISPR
mediated knockdown, and extend the analysis to other GEFs or GTPase Activating Proteins (GAPs) that show
early morphogenetic defects. The results of these experiments will provide basic understanding of normal
vertebrate morphogenesis, and insights into the ways that different cellular behaviors are controlled."
10823261,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Interactions between cells direct many aspects of embryonic development. The long-term goal of our research
program is to learn how cell interactions determine the shape, organization, and function of developing cells,
tissues, and organs. Using C. elegans as an in vivo model where genetic analysis, live imaging and cell biology
can be combined, we have developed several simple experimental systems to investigate how cell interactions
regulate conserved morphogenetic events. The specific goals of this proposal are to use these model systems
to fill key gaps in understanding how cells develop polarity, how small tubes form, and how niche cell
interactions regulate germ cell biology.
 In one project, we are investigating how cell contact induces apicobasal polarity. This project addresses
two outstanding questions – how cell contacts induce the PAR protein asymmetries that polarize cells, and
how PAR proteins elaborate other intracellular asymmetries. We previously discovered that E-cadherin signals
to induce polarity by recruiting the RhoGAP PAC-1, which triggers PAR protein asymmetries. We will extend
these findings by uncovering new molecular links connecting PAC-1 to the E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail, by
identifying additional signaling pathways that contribute to polarization, and by investigating how the PAR
protein aPKC induces the formation of epithelial junctions.
 In a second project, we are investigating how small tubes develop. Small tubes such as capillaries can
form in the cytoplasm of a cell when vesicles are targeted to an invading apical domain. It is unclear how
vesicles are targeted to this site to form intracellular tubes. We are addressing this question by determining
how the excretory cell forms an intracellular tube. We found that PAR proteins localize the exocyst vesicle-
tethering complex to direct vesicle fusion events to the invading apical domain, and will extend these findings
by investigating how PAR proteins recruit the exocyst and how the initial site for tube formation is specified.
 In a final project, we are determining how niche cell interactions influence germ cell development. Niche
cells wrap membrane extensions around germ cells and stem cells but the significance of these interactions is
poorly understood. We discovered that primordial germ cells (PGCs) extend large protrusions that are wrapped
and cannibalized by intestinal cells, eliminating most PGC mitochondria. We will determine the importance of
PGC lobe cannibalism, testing the hypothesis that it helps ensure the health of germline mitochondria.
 Together, our findings will reveal new, basic insights into how cell interactions guide critical developmental
events, providing a foundation for understanding the contribution of cell interactions in human development
and disease."
10837721,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
 Asthma and obesity are prevalent conditions in the United States. Obese individuals with asthma are at
risk for obesity-associated asthma, a distinct phenotype that is more severe and exacerbation prone. Insulin
resistance, pre-diabetes, and diabetes, a spectrum of disorders in glucose metabolism that is enriched in
obesity, have been implicated as contributing to the excess morbidity observed in obesity-associated asthma.
In general populations, these conditions have been associated with diminished lung function and respiratory
symptoms, supporting a pathologic role in pulmonary health. However, there are significant limitations in
literature, and its relevancy to asthma control and severity in humans, and among individuals with obesity, is
uncertain. In this application, we propose to examine the association of insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and
diabetes with asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and lung function, as well as effect modification of this
association by obesity. We will perform this analysis in two complementary aims, (1) a “big data” applied
epidemiology project leveraging the electronic health record of two major health systems in the United States,
combining cohort analyses with pharmaco-epidemiologic techniques to investigate the hypothesized pathway,
and (2) a prospectively enrolled cohort study of obese participants with asthma who undergo bariatric surgery,
with repeated measurements of insulin resistance, lung function, and patient-reported asthma outcomes. The
results of these analyses will build evidence for a deleterious role of insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and
diabetes within obesity-associated asthma. This is especially important, as this common asthma phenotype
has few specific treatment options. This project proposal will provide mentored training for the applicant to
develop skills in the conduct of a patient-oriented clinical study, pharmacoepidemiology, EHR analytic
techniques, and biostatistics. These skills will be pivotal toward the applicant's goal of becoming an
independent physician-scientist and clinical epidemiologist with expertise in asthma and obesity-associated
asthma. He is overseen by a mentorship team comprised of experts in asthma, patient-oriented research, EHR
epidemiology, and biostatistics. The career development plan is a natural continuation of research activities in
fellowship and serves to establish an expertise distinct from his principal mentor. The research strategy and
career development plan will be operationalized within the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at
the Johns Hopkins University, leveraging a collaborative and productive research environment with a strong
history of successful development of junior faculty."

Despite significant progress toward deciphering the genetic cause of many rare disease phenotypes in the
NHGRI Centers for Mendelian Genetics (CMG), more than half of the genes underlying Mendelian diseases
remain undiscovered. However, remarkable developments in genomics technologies and the aggregation of
massive reference datasets are poised to advance Mendelian gene discovery, provided these technologies can
be exploited using sophisticated analytic tools in large and diverse cohorts. Importantly, these methods and
datasets can only catalyze gene discovery if they are rapidly shared with the community, and enabling this goal
has been a primary focus of our Broad Institute CMG. Here, we bring together an extraordinary team of
investigators with diverse expertise, complementary technologies, novel analytic methods, an established
recruitment network, and platforms that we have developed for data sharing to explore the genetic underpinnings
of Mendelian disease, and to further enable therapeutic development for rare diseases.
The Broad Institute Mendelian Genomics Research Center (MGRC) builds upon the world-class track record of
Mendelian gene discovery, methods development, and data sharing set by the Broad CMG. Our team has
invested considerable effort to develop widely adopted tools and platforms empowering variant analysis, such
as GATK, gnomAD, and seqr, and to facilitate open sharing of variants, data, and analysis tools. Over the last
four years, we have generated and shared data for over 15,000 samples from 7,600 families. In the process, we
have uncovered 256 novel disease-gene relationships, with 473 additional genes undergoing follow-up.
Our MGRC roadmap will rely on exome sequencing and rapid data sharing as the most efficient frontline
approach, given that the vast majority of CMG discoveries are derived from coding variants, followed by genome
sequencing on unsolved cases (Aim 1). Complementary approaches to discover variation not captured by
conventional methods will include emerging sequencing technologies, reference-free assembly, improved
annotation of evolutionary constraint, large-scale data aggregation, and novel analytic methods. Transcriptome
sequencing, epigenetic profiling, and CRISPR editing, as well as in vitro and in vivo functional modeling, will then
inform functional interpretation and mechanistic dissection (Aim 2). Finally, we will use our platforms to create
new tools and approaches for transformative data sharing across the MGRCs and the broader community (Aim
3). At their conclusion, these studies will significantly contribute to completing the catalog of genes underlying
Mendelian disease, providing new biological insights into their functional mechanisms, and openly sharing the
data, tools, and discoveries that we produce."
10883553,"Recent advances in the multi-parametric MRI of the prostate have led to a surge in new
research methods for the detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer - with the goal of accurate risk-
stratification of prostate cancer. Specifically, a traditional Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS)-guided
biopsy tends to fail, as samples are randomly collected from the prostate without aiming at
suspicious lesions often visible in MRI. Currently, several new MRI biopsy approaches have come
to the forefront. They are being evaluated and adopted in clinical practice, including in-bore MRI-
guided biopsy and TRUS-guided MRI-fusion biopsy, collectively called ‘MRI-targeted biopsy.’ While
recent literature shows that MRI-targeted biopsies can detect more clinically significant cancer than
a conventional TRUS-guided biopsy, there is still a substantial issue with the precision placement of
the needle in these procedures particularly in transperineal approach, resulting in clinicians being
overly conservative with the amount of tissue removal (Zhang et al., 2019). Need to address needle
placement accuracy in transperineal biopsy is further heightened lately as the fluoroquinolone-
resistant Escherichia coli is becoming a significant concern in public health, and clinicians are
shifting to use transperineal biopsies to avoid post-biopsy infections and overuse of antibiotics.
Literature, as well as our preliminary studies, found that needle deflection is a substantial obstacle
for precision aiming in transperineal biopsies. Abundant literature on needle deflection analysis,
needle steering, and image-guided robots are available in pre-clinical engineering studies. Yet,
clinically viable or proven solutions to address the needle deflection is yet to be seen. Therefore, the
objective of this application is to develop and test a cooperative robotic intervention with closed-loop
error compensation in MRI targeted biopsies and focal therapies, resulting in more precisely
targeted instrument placement. Accurately, we will aim to address needle deflection by the synergic
use of advanced imaging and robotics. Guided by robust preliminary data, this objective is achieved
by pursuing three specific aims: 1) We will develop novel tracking techniques and clinically deploy a
cooperatively controlled, hands-on robotic needle placement manipulator to enable fine instrument
control at the periphery of the MRI bore. 2) We will test the usefulness of a cooperatively controlled
robot to increase the accuracy of needle placement in animal studies mimicking MRI-guided
biopsies of the prostate. Our approach is innovative in its application of novel cooperative robotic
control, in which the clinician maintains ultimate control with the direction of motion being
autonomous to ensure the desired path is followed to the intended target. The proposed study is
also clinically significant since the completion of this current engineering study will enable machine-
assisted semi-autonomous percutaneous therapy, much discussed in the recent editorial article in
Science Robotics (Yang et al., 2018). The impact of the study reaches beyond MRI-targeted
prostate intervention; the technology developed can be translated into other forms of MRI-guided or
ultrasound-guided intervention."

Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a recessively inherited disorder characterized by disordered hemoglobin
structure, aberrant endothelial interactions, systemic inflammation, oxidant stress, and activation of the

disproportionately higher burden with an estimated 15 million of the world’s 25 million SCD individuals; 75%
of all babies born with SCD; & mortality rate for children under 5 range between 50%-90%. These include
absence of National control programs, dearth of basic facilities to manage patients, absence of systematic
screening for SCD, pervasive lack of implementation of evidence-based preventative interventions, cultural
misconceptions about the genesis of the disease, and lack of governmental support. By the sheer numbers
of patients in Africa, there is a potential for large volumes of clinical information to be harvested though
operational research for analyses to inform evidence-based decision-making on healthcare, as well as
healthcare policies for SCD on the continent. To this end, the Sickle Pan-African Research Consortium
(SPARCo) in 2017 started a registry across multiple sites in three countries: Ghana (an applicant for the
current U01 grant), Nigeria, and Tanzania. In the first phase of SPARCO, we established a collaborative site
in Kumasi and enrolled 2,915 SCD patients including 1,453 from our Newborn screening program into a
registry, and built capacity for future research studies. In this second phase, we have added an in-country
Satellite site in the capital city Accra, which has well developed clinical, training and research programs in
SCD, to form Ghana-SPARCO. Our overarching goal is to establish a prospective cohort of 6,000 individuals
living with SCD across the lifespan with a dual purpose of understanding: 1) the determinants of the protean
manifestations of acute and chronic complications of SCD in a resource-limited setting, and 2) to conduct
implementation research to address, surmount & integrate the best resource-based standards of clinical
care. Our vision is to establish hubs of excellence for research and care for SCD in Ghana. We will work with
the Coordinating Center to; (i) establish a harmonized patient registry to, (ii) integrate standards of care for
SCD, (iii) conduct cohort studies focusing on an assessment of burden and predictors of neurovascular, renal
and infectious complications of SCD across the lifespan & (iv) conduct implementation research studies on
newborn screening, retention of adolescence in SCD clinics & develop an implementation strategy for routine
integration of preventative interventions for SCD. Achieving these benchmarks will help establish the
infrastructure to develop a SCD in SSA Research Network."
10878751,"ABSTRACT
My history with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and NIGMS, from active site labeling to holoenzyme
structures and tissue imaging, has been long and productive. My career has been guided by the fundamental
principle that structure will reveal function with the ultimate goal being to elucidate how PKA signaling regulates
biology and how it is altered in disease. Our tools include biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology to
probe mechanisms as well as crystallography, cryoEM, molecular dynamics, and imaging to explore conforma-
tional space and localization in cells. A hallmark of my laboratory has been to build interdisciplinary teams that
reach across all of these scales. Although it has been over 30 years now since we solved that first protein
kinase structure of the PKA catalytic (C) subunit, which has served ever since as the prototypical protein
kinase, surprisingly we are still learning new things. PKA signaling in cells is mediated by full-length R2C2
holoenzymes that are targeted to discreet sites in the cell near dedicated substrates, and a major recent
achievement was our solving the cryoEM structure of the compact full-length RII holoenzyme in 2020 where
for the first time all of the domains could be visualized. During this next phase we will continue with our
characterization of holoenzyme complexes focusing, in particular, on RIIβ, which is enriched in neurons and
localizes to Golgi. In addition, however, we will build on two new discoveries that came from our work over the
past three years. First is the discovery that Cβ subunits, a family of previously unexplored splice variants that
account for ~50% of PKA signaling in neurons, are linked to a neurodegenerative phenotype that abolishes
Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. With imaging in human retina we then validated that Cβ is highly expressed
in neurons, that it localizes differently than C, and that Cβ4/Cβ4ab are enriched at mitochondria. We are now
characterizing the neuron-specific Cβ4 isoforms and the specific mutants that correlate with Shh signaling.
Another new and potentially related discovery is that there is a functional PKI-like sequence embedded in the
C-terminal tail of Smoothened, the GPCR that is associated with Shh signaling. A final discovery that the RI
subunit undergoes liquid:liquid phase separation that contributes to cAMP buffering in cells opens another new
frontier for non-canonical PKA signaling in cells. We find that RIβ also forms biomolecular condensates that
are distinct from RIα, and we are now characterizing an RIβ mutant, RIβ(R335W), that is associated with
dementia and autism. An essential part of our strategy is to use a multi-scale approach that includes not only
biochemical characterizations and structure solutions but also high-resolution imaging in human tissues where
we can hopefully correlate changes in localization and expression with pathogenic mutations in Cβ and RIβ. In
parallel, we will build on our cryo-EM structure of the full length RIIβ holoenzyme where we hope to trap some
of the domain dynamics that contribute to the highly allosteric and isoform-specific cAMP-mediated activation
of each holoenzymes. With our exceptional team of collaborators we are poised to make rapid progress."
10817771,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The actin cytoskeleton is crucial for cellular properties and behaviors including shape, migration, and division. It
is also critical for cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix connections as well as cell-cell fusion. Because of these
numerous essential functions in cell physiology, actin dysfunction is also a common contributor to pathogenesis,
for example, in inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer metastasis, and microbial infection. Despite many
years of study, however, understanding how actin assembly is regulated and harnessed in the cytoplasm and
nucleus for intracellular events, cellular behaviors, and cell-cell interactions remains a key outstanding problem
in cell biology. In our NIGMS-funded research, my lab has taken a distinctive approach to address this important
gap in knowledge, which is to examine the interactions between microbes that do not cause serious human
illness and the host cell actin cytoskeleton as a window into actin regulation and function. Our approach
leverages the fact that microbes colonize host cells through their ability to target actin, often eliciting amplified
cellular responses by mimicking or manipulating host molecules, making them powerful tools for revealing
molecular mechanisms of actin regulation and function. This scientific premise is supported by many examples
of how studying microbe-host interactions has enhanced our understanding of basic cell biological processes.
The research described in this MIRA application makes use of microbes as tools to address three fundamental
cell biological questions: (1) How is actin polymerization at membranes regulated and mobilized to drive
movement? (2) How and why is actin transported into and polymerized within the nucleus for gene expression,
nuclear organization, intranuclear movement, and nuclear envelope dynamics? (3) How is actin polymerization
in plasma membrane protrusions harnessed to induce cell-cell fusion? We will investigate these questions using
three model microbes that infect cells and mobilize actin in a manner that makes them powerful cell biological
tools: Mycobacterium marinum as a tool to understand the regulation of actin assembly at membranes to drive
intracellular movement; the baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus as a tool to
understand the regulation and function of actin in the nucleus; and Burkholderia thailandensis as a tool to
understand the role of actin in cell-cell fusion. By leveraging our expertise in both cell biology and microbiology,
and deploying a synergistic combination of microbial and host genetic methods, advanced imaging approaches,
and biochemical methods, we are uniquely positioned to advance the field. Our results will enhance our
understanding of the mechanisms of actin regulation and may provide new insights into diagnosing, treating, and
preventing diseases associated with actin dysfunction."
10818411,"Chronic pain is common among individuals treated with opioid agonist therapies (OAT;
buprenorphine or methadone) and is associated with poorer opioid use disorder (OUD)
outcomes, including higher attrition and higher levels of drug use. Treatment of chronic pain in
individuals who are maintained on OAT is complex, as presence of chronic pain is associated
with greater frequency of psychiatric disorders as well as sleep problems and other
comorbidities that can contribute to poorer outcomes. Given the large number of individuals
with chronic pain seeking OAT, standardized, lower-cost, and easily disseminable approaches
to treat individuals in OAT who have chronic pain are needed and, if demonstrated to be
effective in this population, would have high public health significance.
In response to RFA-AT-19-006, we plan to develop and pilot test an integrated, web-based
cognitive behavioral approach (R61 phase), and then conduct a randomized clinical trial
evaluating its efficacy relative to standard care in a large and diverse sample of individuals with
chronic pain treated with buprenorphine or methadone (R33 phase). The new program will
retain key components of Dr. Carroll’s computer-based training for cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT4CBT), including its emphasis on teaching cognitive and behavioral coping skills in an
engaging way and focus on the 5 A’s of MAT (Adherence, Attendance, Abstinence, Alternate
Activities and Accessing support); it will add components from Dr. Heapy’s COPES
(Cooperative Pain Education and Self-Management) intervention (self-management of chronic
pain, with IVR monitoring of pain intensity and interference, physical activity, and skills practice)
and modify existing CBT4CBT modules to address the complex interplay between pain and
drug use in this population, emphasizing the development of generalizable skills. In the R33
phase, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial evaluating CBT4CBT-COPES in a diverse
sample 160 of individuals enrolled in agonist treatment (methadone or buprenorphine) who have
chronic pain, in a 3-month randomized clinical trial with a 6-month follow-up, comparing it to
standard treatment alone. The primary retention outcome will be adherence with agonist
treatment; the primary pain outcome will be the PROMIS 6-item Pain Interference Short Form."
10837027,"Chemotaxis occurs during a number of key physiological events including angiogenesis, embryonic
development and wound healing. It also contributes to disease progression in pathological conditions such as
cancer metastasis and arthritis. The goal of the current proposal is to reveal how biochemical reactions and
physical characteristics, such as membrane curvature, deformation, and assembly phase, interact with one
another in achieving dynamic, accurate yet highly efficient cell migration. Chemotaxis has been understood
mainly in the perspective of signal transduction, while if and how physical properties of membranes play a role,
and how they interact with signal transduction remain largely unknown. By newly developing and implementing
a series of molecular actuators that can directly probe membrane properties with high spatio-temporal precision
inside lively migrating cells, we will reveal an interplay between signal transduction and membrane mechanics.
What molecular mechanisms generate local membrane curvatures developing into filopodia and
lamellipodia? In sensing chemoattractants, cells polarize by undergoing asymmetric membrane deformation
consisting of filopodia and lamellipodia at the front, and membrane retraction at the rear. We recently found that
curvature-sensitive proteins are a missing link between actin cytoskeleton and membranes. The result made us
hypothesize that actin machinery and curvature sensing and remodeling proteins, when properly modulated in a
feedback loop, are sufficient to produce desired types of membrane deformations such as lamellipodia and
filopodia. We will thus identify a particular combination of Rho GTPases, actin regulators, and BAR proteins, and
the molecular logic thereof, that are responsible for formation of filopodia and lamellipodia.
How do signaling components in migrating cells respond to membrane deformation? Migrating cells
exhibit dynamic morphological changes at plasma membranes and nuclear envelopes “as a consequence” of
cytoskeletal rearrangement regulated by signal components. To explore a possibility that membrane deformation
talks back to cytoskeletal and signal components, we will deploy molecular actuators that can directly deform
membranes. We will then quantify subsequently emerging activity of signaling components such as receptor
tyrosine kinases, PI3K, and small GTPases, as well as transcription factors such as YAP and Elk.
How does the phase-separated cytoskeletal biomolecular condensate play a role in membrane
deformation? Actin networks can undergo formation of biomolecular condensates at the plasma membrane due
to weak multivalent interactions among actin regulators. To examine the physiological importance of such phase
separation events, we will adapt molecular techniques to assemble or disassemble the condensates. These
operations will uniquely achieve gain- or loss-of function manipulations without altering an amount of the
molecular constituents; what is altered is their physical assembly status. We will characterize cell migration
phenotypes before and after deploying phase manipulations."
10875378,"ABSTRACT!
African ancestry is a risk factor for worse outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Nevertheless,
prognostic tools and treatment regimens are no different for African American (AA) than European American
(EA) TNBC patients. Personalizing medicine for AA TNBC patients has been hindered by the fact that this
population is highly admixed, so self-reported race often does not accurately reflect African genetic ancestry.
There is also a dearth of studies that have analyzed tumor biomarkers and clinical outcomes using ancestry-
genotyped TNBC specimens. Furthermore, few preclinical TNBC studies consider race in experimental design,
and AA TNBC patients are markedly underrepresented in clinical trials. A critical barrier to progress in
improving outcomes for AA TNBC patients is a lack of prognostic tools and treatment modalities that have been
precisely tailored to this patient population. The broad, long-range goal of this project is to enable development
of precision medicine for AA TNBC patients by advancing knowledge of the utility of nuclear HSET (nHSET) as
a prognostic biomarker for AA TNBCs as well as the molecular mechanisms of racial disparities in TNBC
aggressiveness and how they can be targeted. Our lab has uncovered that HSET more strongly promotes
proliferation and migration of AA than EA TNBC cell lines. In addition, nHSET independently predicts poor
outcomes in AA but not EA TNBCs, but this must be validated after accounting for percent African genetic
ancestry in multivariable survival models and in native African TNBCs. Our proposed project has three aims.
First, the proportion of African genetic ancestry will be determined for a large cohort of TNBC patient samples
acquired from US, and Nigeria and we will determine if nHSET can serve as a racial disparity biomarker for the
stratification of TNBCs after adjusting for their percent African genetic ancestry. Second, since HSET and MYH9
are nuclear binding partners that may assist in chromatin modification to amplify oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin
signaling and MYC expression (which we have found is enriched in AA compared with EA TNBCs), we will
characterize racial differences in the HSET-MYH9-MYC axis in TNBCs using patient-derived samples and
correlate these racial distinctions to differences in genomic stability in TNBCs. We will employ multi-colored lenti-
CRISPR-Cas9 system for knocking out key genes in this axis in AA/EA cell lines to test if the HSET-MYH9-MYC
axis drives tumor aggressiveness more strongly in AA than in EA TNBCs. In Aim 3, the value of a promising
commercially available HSET inhibitor will be tested in xenograft models of AA and EA TNBC patient-derived
cells. Thus, this study will test the hypothesis that nHSET is a novel therapeutically actionable biomarker with
greater value for AA than EA TNBC patients that drives TNBC progression and chemoresistance more strongly
in AA than EA TNBC patients. The impact of this project will be to advance knowledge of prognostic biomarkers,
molecular mechanisms of disease aggressiveness, and effective treatment regimens for AA TNBC patients.

10783015,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Early detection of lung cancer among asymptomatic individuals is a priority for reducing mortality of the number
one cancer killer worldwide. Most lung cancers are first detected as indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs).
While the vast majority of IPNs are benign, those malignant ones present with specific features that should allow
for the early discrimination and intervention. We have recently completed a study demonstrating the value of
structural imaging features analysis in providing improved accuracy in detection of cancers among IPNs with
accuracy of over 90% trained in the NLST and validated in two independent cohorts. The AUC increased from
baseline risk estimate of disease using clinical parameters (Mayo model) 0.78 to 0.84 and from 0.82 to 0.92 in
two independent validation cohorts. Similarly, we tested the added value of our high sensitivity hsCYFRA 21-1
assay in three populations of lung nodules and obtained similar added value to the MAYO model. Finally, we
identified signatures predictive of lung cancer using large scale data mining in the electronic health record (EHR).
The performance of the performance of the established imaging predictor, hsCYFRA concentrations and EHR
trajectories will be validated in a prospective cohort. In an innovative partnership between pulmonary oncology,
radiology, machine learning, and data science experts at Vanderbilt, we propose to integrate the layer of clinical
information accessible in the EHR to improve the noninvasive diagnosis accuracy. In addition, we propose to
take advantage of repeated measures to improve the accuracy of the prediction of cancer and to reduce the time
to diagnosis. We therefore propose the following aims. In Aim 1 we will validate advanced quantitative imaging
analyses to distinguish early benign from malignant IPNs based on repeated measures of 1000 individuals. In
Aim 2. We will test in 150 individuals with lung nodules the added value of repeated measures of hsCYFRA 21-
1 protein blood biomarker in diagnostic accuracy over the baseline concentrations of the biomarker. In Aim 3 we
will test a deep learning strategy from the EHR of 20,000 patients from VUMC to identify patterns likely to improve
the early detection of lung cancer, and in Aim 4 we will test the added value of monitoring changes in levels of
the markers for early detection using repeated pre-diagnosis chest CT studies, serum analysis of hsCYFRA 21-
1, and EHR patterns from our lung cancer screening program. Built upon strong preliminary data and unique
resources from VUMC that include access to large imaging and HER data sources this novel integrative study
has the potential to generate highly impactful and translatable results to reduce false positive rates among IPNs,
and morbidity and mortality from lung cancer. This application responds to PAR 19-264 using low-dose lung
screening computed tomography longitudinal analysis integrated with a lead serum biomarker and the power of
artificial intelligence to mine the EHR for the discovery of a novel integrative strategy for the early detection of
premetastatic lung cancer."
10793611,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Peptide hormone biosynthesis in the RER, packaging into secretory granules (SGs) in the Golgi, and exocytosis
of SGs at the plasma membrane are well-studied processes in neuroendocrine cells. However, there is limited
understanding of intracellular peptide hormone degradation and SG turnover. Only a small fraction (<10%) of
SG-stored peptide hormones are utilized in physiological stimulation so that most SGs would undergo turnover.
SG degradation mechanisms need to be balanced by SG biogenesis to maintain SG pools it is unclear how this
coordination is achieved. Classical EM studies in the pituitary and endocrine pancreas had shown that SGs
merge with multivesicular body (MVB)/lysosomes for degradation in a process termed crinophagy. We developed
several fluorescence-based cell assays in neuroendocrine BON cells to detect the SG-MVB/lysosome merge.
Because Munc13-4 is involved in endosomal fusion mechanisms in multiple cell types, we conducted the assays
in cells knocked down for Munc13-4 and observed strong inhibition. In aim 1, we will extend structured
illumination microsope studies to resolve whether crinophagy is the major mechanism and whether it is
accompanied by microautophagy. We will pursue CgA timer protein studies to document that older SGs are
preferentially degraded and determine whether such SGs are marked by ubiquitination. Lastly, by reconstituting
SG-MVB/lysosome merge in a cell-free assay, we will determine whether Munc13-4 acts directly to promote the
SG-MVB/lysosome merge. In efforts to document that Munc13-4 knockdown should mimic lysosome inhibitor
treatment, we revealed that Munc13-4 knockdown has additional effects likely upstream from SG degradation.
Instead of SG accumulation, we observed that SGs were smaller. When examined carefully, the small SGs were
observed to undergo constitutive exocytosis. This implies that Munc13-4 also has effects on the SG biogenesis
pathway. Follow-up studies will include immunofluorescense studies of marker proteins to determine where small
SGs emerged in Munc13-4 knockdown cells. The overall phenotype of Munc13-4 knockdown is dominated by a
shift from SG degradation to constitutive exocytosis. Were this to be true for hormones or prohormones this
would have physiological consequences that we will assess in a Munc13-4 KO mouse. In aim 2, we will determine
the mechanistic basis for the Munc13-4 regulation of the SG-MVB/lysosome merge. An siRNA screen using a
robust fluorescence-based assay for the SG-MVB/lysosome merge, we will identify Rab, SNARE, and accessory
factors required for SG-MVB fusion. We will develop a liposome-based fusion assay using the proteins identified
in the screen. This will allow us to test what factors like Rab27 regulate Munc13-4-dependent fusion. Lastly, with
highly purified Munc13-4 protein we will determine its structure by cryo-EM. Based on a on a liposome fusion
assay, we will determine the tethering properties of Munc13-4 in cryo-ET studies. Overall this work will reveal
important new cellular roles for Munc13-4 in neuroendocrine cells and contribute a molecular understanding on
the tethering role for Munc13-4."

Obesity and diabetes are increased among individuals subjected to shiftwork, reduced sleep, and social jetlag.
High fat diet (HFD) misaligns intrinsic circadian cycles with the light/dark cycle and alters oscillations of metabolic
genes in visceral adipose tissue, a key site in the control of energy balance, glucose regulation, and inflammatory
disorders. Conversely, restricting HFD to the dark period only realigns meal time with circadian rhythms and
enhances insulin sensitivity, promoting healthful obesity. How circadian disruption in visceral adipose tissue
contributes to obesity pathophysiology remains unknown. In exciting new data, we show strong day/night
rhythms in adipocyte mitochondrial respiration with maximal uncoupling at the onset of the active period that is
dependent upon a functional clock. Further, 13C-glucose entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is also
highest at the beginning of the active period, indicating autonomous circadian control of WAT metabolic flux
across the day/night cycle. Surprisingly, in Bmal1-/- adipocytes, we observe reprogramming of adipocyte
metabolism with increased 13C labeling in succinate and reduced levels of other TCA intermediates, a signature
of stress and ROS accumulation. Here we seek to test the hypothesis that the circadian clock controls
energy flux within visceral adipose tissue at the level of fuel entry into the TCA cycle through a process
disrupted by HFD. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that circadian coordination of feeding time and adipose
energy utilization cycles promote healthful adipose expansion using genetic lineage tracer animals and metabolic
phenotyping. We will assess adipose tissue remodeling and 13C glucose flux into the TCA cycle in addition to
lipid and organic acids across the light-dark cycle in mice fed regular chow or HFD either ad lib or time-restricted
to the light (misttimed feeding) or dark (optimal time feeding) period at thermoneutrality (30oC). We will also test
the requirement of the WAT clock and the effect of adipose-specific BMAL1 overexpression in HFD on adipose
remodeling, inflammation, fibrosis, and glucose homeostasis. Aim 1 results will establish the interplay
between the WAT clock and feeding time in energy flux, metabolic health, and capacity for healthful
adipose expansion, particularly with the new addition of the light-only feeding group for comparison to the dark-
only and AL cohorts. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that HFD abrogates circadian energetic cycles in
visceral adipose tissue and induces epigenetic remodeling towards a proinflammatory cell fate. We will perform
tandem chromatin and expression profiling in adipocytes to identify the time signature and molecular drivers of
visceral WAT remodeling in ad lib and light- and dark-only-fed mice on HFD. Finally, we will examine whether
BMAL1 overexpression during HFD preserves the healthful chromatin landscape of regular chow fed mice.
Results of Aim 2 will determine how clock control of chromatin activity and transcription contributes to
healthful obesity. Collectively, these studies will define the role of time-of-day in adipogenesis and nutrient flux,
uncovering novel targets to combat the immunometabolic complications of obesity and circadian disruption."
10796790,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a public health crisis in the US marked by
growing racial disparities, with African Americans (AAs) two to three times more likely to be diagnosed than
non-Hispanic Whites. Efforts to identify modifiable earlier-life risk and protective factors for known midlife
risk factors for poor cognitive outcomes in later life are needed to protect the health of middle-aged and
older AAs. We propose to prospectively examine trajectories of stress exposures from childhood to early
midlife as predictors of known midlife risk factors for subsequent AD/ADRD in two primarily (~66%) AA
cohorts that are now ages 41-45 and have been followed repeatedly from age 6 to age 32 (2009-2011) by
the Johns Hopkins Prevention Intervention Research Center (PIRC). Relevant individual- and community-
level stress exposures that occur from early life to middle adulthood include: 1) adverse life circumstances
(i.e., extreme poverty, residential instability, crime, incarceration, racial discrimination, traumatic events); 2)
mental disorders and their symptoms; and 3) poor sleep (e.g., abnormal duration, fragmentation).
Additionally, these stress exposures have been linked to other risk factors for AD/ADRD, including obesity,
hypertension, and diabetes, by which AAs are disproportionately affected. We aim to determine the extent
to which ~35-year trajectories of stress exposures are associated with estimated midlife risk for later-life
AD/ADRD, physiological aging (telomere length, p16, methylation age), epigenetic modification, and
inflammation, and cognitive performance—all measured in early midlife—and if these associations are
moderated by sex, race, and AD/ADRD risk genes. We will also explore how the timing of exposures in the
life-course affects these associations, and if other potential moderators (e.g., childhood academic
achievement, educational/occupational attainment, alcohol/drug use, conduct problems, social support,
perceived control) affect these associations. We will further explore effects of two early-life (ages 6-8) PIRC
interventions on midlife study outcomes. To accomplish this, 1,150 PIRC participants will complete two in-
home interviews including a cognitive battery and actigraphic sleep assessments, and we will collect
biospecimens for genetic and epigenetic material and physiological aging measures. This study is a rare
opportunity to clarify links of earlier-life stress exposures with estimated midlife dementia risk, identify
vulnerable subgroups for targeted AD/ADRD prevention, elucidate the role of social inequities in
determining racial disparities in AD dementia, and establish a midlife cognitive baseline for future follow-up
of these unusually well-characterized longitudinal, primarily AA cohorts."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of progressive conditions ranging from nonalcoholic fatty
liver (NAFL) or hepatic steatosis to the more severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) characterized by
excessive inflammation and varying degrees of fibrosis. NASH-related cirrhosis is the second leading cause of
liver transplantation in the United States and NASH patients face an increased risk of developing hepatocellular
carcinoma. The incidence of NASH and NASH-related cirrhosis continues to rise; there, are no FDA-approved
therapies as we lack a clear understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving the progression of
NAFL to NASH and the subsequent development of cirrhosis. While there is mounting evidence that inflammation
is central to the initiation and progression of NAFLD, the specific immune pathways that drive inflammation in
this setting are not well understood. The objective of this proposal is to improve our functional understanding of
the mechanisms by which immune cells contribute to NASH-related hepatic inflammation, and to identify the key
molecules underlying recruitment of immune cells to the liver. Our published findings and preliminary data have
demonstrated that the heterodimeric integrin receptor α4β7 and its ligand, mucosal addressin cell adhesion
molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), play a pivotal role in NASH-related hepatic inflammation and fibrosis by promoting the
recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and CD4 T cells to the liver. These data provide the scientific rationale
for our central hypothesis that the α4β7/MAdCAM-1 axis drives hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in NASH by
promoting recruitment of proinflammatory monocytes and CD4 T cells to the liver. We will test this hypothesis in
both a mouse model of progressive NAFLD and in human liver tissue from NASH patients according to the
following integrated Specific Aims. Aim 1 will investigate the contribution of α4β7+ monocytes and CD4 T cells in
promoting hepatic inflammation in NASH. Aim 2 focuses on the role of hepatic stellate cells in the regulation of
immune cell recruitment to the NASH liver. Lastly, Aim 3 investigates the mechanisms regulating the
α4β7/MAdCAM-1 axis in NASH. The results of our investigations will provide comprehensive and mechanistic
insights into the inflammatory events crucial to the pathogenesis of NASH, and may lead to the identification of
viable therapeutic targets for regulating hepatic inflammation. Given the importance of immune cells in governing
metabolic inflammation and the therapeutic potential of targeting immune cells, this proposal addresses
significant and clinically relevant issues in NASH."

This K23 career development award will position the candidate to become an independent clinical researcher
with expertise in the application of mobile health (mHealth) technologies to improve psychosocial clinical trials
for youth at high risk for severe mood disorders (SMD; i.e., bipolar I/II disorder and recurrent or unremitting
major depression). BACKGROUND. Psychosocial treatments (most notably cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT)) for adolescents at high risk for SMD show some efficacy in reducing symptoms and rates of mood
episode relapse; however, the size of the effects range from small to moderate. A contributing factor to the
variable effect sizes is the low rates of adherence to CBT’s prescribed treatment tasks (e.g., cognitive
reappraisal). CBT’s mechanisms of therapeutic change hinge upon practice and implementation of the
treatment tasks between sessions. However, adolescents commonly report low motivation, forgetfulness, and
a lack of resources as barriers to completing the CBT treatment tasks. This challenges clinical researchers to
devise better methods of engaging patients in these treatment tasks. SPECIFIC AIMS. This proposal aims to
better engage participants in treatment and bridge treatment sessions by (1) adapting and testing the
acceptability of an existing mobile application (app) that will reinforce session content, facilitate practice of
treatment skills, and allow participants to log and monitor thoughts and symptoms; and (2) conducting a
randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of an app-enhanced CBT for adolescents (ages 13-17) at
high risk for SMD in improving participant adherence. TRAINING. The candidate will achieve short-term goals
through a resource-rich institutional environment and a cohesive training plan in (1) the planning, delivery, and
evaluation of mHealth technologies, (2) the conduct of clinical trials, and (3) statistical methodologies to
examine high dimensional mHealth data through the use of functional data analysis. MENTORSHIP. The
candidate will be supported by an expert interdisciplinary team: David Miklowitz, PhD (primary mentor), Bonnie
Zima, MD, MPH (co-mentor), Catherine Sugar, PhD (co-mentor), Armen Arevian MD, PhD (collaborator), Eric
Granholm, PhD (consultant), and Jill Ehrenreich-May, PhD (consultant). IMPACT. In line with NIMH funding
priorities, the proposed research will answer critical questions about (1) the acceptability and initial efficacy of a
mobile app in improving participant adherence and acceptability for adolescents at high risk for SMD and (2)
begin to uncover the initial mechanisms by which a mobile app can influence participant adherence. While
initial studies will focus on adolescents at high risk for SMD, it is anticipated that the candidate’s training and
research will have broad applications to a range of age populations and psychiatric conditions. Through this
K23 award, the candidate will gain the training and preliminary data necessary to apply for a larger NIMH
clinical trial to determine what components of a mobile app affect participant adherence and test participant
adherence as a mediator of psychiatric and psychosocial treatment outcomes."
10830958,"Transplantation is the preferred treatment for patients suffering from end-stage kidney disease. While short-
term outcomes have greatly improved with the development of more effective immunosuppression, the long-
term outcomes remain problematic with life-span limiting complications including a significant number of
patients developing diabetes, accelerated heart disease as well as increased rates of cancers and infections.
For decades transplant researchers and clinicians have sought to develop strategies to induce immune
tolerance to transplanted organs and avoid the requirement for life-long immunosuppression. Transplantation
tolerance is typically defined as the lack of a donor-directed immune response while preserving protective
immunity in the absence of long-term immunosuppression. It is likely that any successful tolerance regimen
will incorporate targeted immunosuppression strategies like costimulation blockade. Two of the most
promising reagents are anti-CD154 and anti-OX40L, both of which are protolerogenic and supportive of
immunoregulation as part of their mechanism of action. We have partnered with industry to evaluate two
clinically relevant compounds, dazodalibep (HZN-4920) an innovative anti-CD154 nonantibody scaffold protein
and a high affinity, novel anti-human OX40L antibody. In addition, we will assess the importance of the VISTA
pathway on the induction of donor-specific tolerance using an agonistic anti-human VISTA antibody. VISTA
has a dual role in negatively regulating antigen specific T cell responses while also impacting the innate
immune response by inhibiting ischemia reperfusion injury, monocyte activation and neutrophil migration
thereby suppressing the early inflammatory response. The combination of cellular therapy and costimulation
blockade is a powerful strategy to promote donor-specific tolerance. Myeloid derived suppressor cells
(MDSCs) have inherent immunosuppressive properties and have been used to facilitate tolerance. They
modulate innate immunity and inhibit T cell activation and effector cell function while also promoting regulatory
T cell expansion for maintenance of long-term donor specific tolerance. We will use donor bone marrow
derived MDSCs in combination with novel therapeutics to control naïve (anti-CD154, anti-VISTA) and memory
(anti-OX40L) T cell responses as well as the innate immune response (anti-VISTA) in combination with pro-
tolerogenic anti-inflammatory cellular therapy (repetitive MDSC infusions). We will test this strategy in a
clinically relevant nonhuman primate kidney transplant model."
10830966,"Abstract/ Summary
Blockade of CD40-CD154 interactions is known to be a highly effective means of inhibiting alloreactive T cell
responses and under some conditions inducing transplantation tolerance in both murine and non-human
primate models. However, the potential of this therapeutic strategy to have a transformative impact on
transplantation outcomes has yet to be realized. CD154 blockers were associated with adverse
hypercoagulability in early clinical trials, instigating the therapeutic targeting of CD40 as an alternative therapy.
However, CD40 blockers have failed in recent clinical trials due to insufficient efficacy. We therefore sought to
determine if there is a biological explanation underlying the observed inferiority of blocking CD40 as compared
to blocking CD154, in order to then devise ways to overcome it. In a 2020 study, we reported that CD11b is
a second receptor for CD154 during alloimmunity, signaling through which is blocked by anti-CD154
reagents but not anti-CD40 reagents. We showed that CD154:CD11b interactions function locally within the
allograft to enhance donor-reactive CD8+ T cell infiltration and accelerate allograft rejection. In addition, new
preliminary data show that CD154 but not CD40 blockade results in the generation of graft-specific Foxp3+
iTreg, suggesting that the addition of CD154:CD11b blockade may boost iTreg generation in the context of
anti-CD40. In this proposal, we will translate these findings into an NHP allogeneic renal transplant model to
elucidate the role of CD154:CD11b blockade in transplantation tolerance, and to test a novel nanotherapeutic
strategy to better target CD154:CD11b interactions and synergize with anti-CD40 in promoting transplantation
tolerance in vivo. In the first Aim, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which CD154:CD11b blockade
contributes to the inhibition of alloimmunity and the induction of Foxp3+ Treg, using novel techniques to identify
and track alloreactive effector and regulatory T cells in NHP, and will use MIBI-TOF and transcriptomic
approaches to interrogate the effects of blocking CD154:CD11b interactions on the immune architecture and
transcriptomic profile of T cells, DC, and macrophage/monocytes within allografts. In the second Aim, we have
developed a novel nanoparticle that is coated with a specific peptide inhibitor that prevents CD154:CD11b
binding. Utilizing cutting edge nanotechnology to block this interaction, instead of a monoclonal antibody, offers
the distinct advantage of the ability to bioengineer the nanoparticle with a separate immunomodulatory
“payload” to further promote tolerance. Given the demonstrated ability of CD154 blockade to induce long-term,
durable tolerance in NHP, our overall hypothesis is that combining the novel CD154:CD11b blocking
nanoparticle with anti-CD40 will result in the establishment of transplantation tolerance."

Natural products (NPs) form a validated and preeminent source of new drug leads, but the low rate of new
discoveries and the limited access to bioactive compounds are challenging current NPs-based drug discovery
and development. Over the past decades, genome mining has become an important way for NP discovery. This
transformative research strategy combines functional genomics and bioinformatics to associate biosynthetic
gene clusters (BGCs) with potential chemical entities. The success of this strategy is supported by increasing
and rapid access to (meta)genomic data, from which diverse rule-based and -free bioinformatics tools enable
depicting the BGCs of different compound families and even assessing their novelty and potential bioactivity.
However, a fundamental challenge faced by genome mining research is how to produce sufficient amounts of
novel, bioactive NPs from mined BGCs. The overall goal of the PI's research program is to access and expand
the therapeutically relevant chemical diversity of microbes directly from their genomes. The central hypothesis
of this work is that microbial genomes can be exploited to produce bioactive NPs and analogs through synthetic
biology (SynBio) and enzymology research. SynBio has achieved many notable successes in the production of
bioactive compounds over the past two decades. In the NP discovery, SynBio studies can allow the expression
of natural and designed BGCs in capable chasses. In parallel, the biosynthesis of microbial NPs is enriched with
functionally diverse enzymes that lend enabling strategies to produce key intermediates and analogs of bioactive
NPs. To achieve the goal and test the hypothesis, this renewal will pursue two interlinked research directions.
Direction 1 will focus on the discovery and production of bioactive NPs from less-explored resources, particularly
in marine entrainment. To maximize the success, our SynBio research will develop and use chasses of multiple
bacterial phyla. Research direction 2 of this proposal will discover and characterize synthetically significant
enzymes using a diverse set of approaches, aiding the access and expansion of therapeutically relevant
chemical diversity of NPs. New enzymes found in Direction 1 will be characterized in Direction 2 and can then
support the mining of new BGCs in Direction 1, leading to tight integration and mutual support of the two
directions. Together, these two directions can afford innovative strategies that enable the effective exploitation
of bioactive NPs from the genomes of less-studied microbes. These studies can also boost the transformation
of NP research from small-scale pursuits to a genome-based high-throughput endeavor, therefore supporting
the paradigm shift in NP-based drug research."
10843210,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bacteria control their growth in response to environmental challenges and sometimes enter a growth arrested
state. Growth-arrested bacteria often show remarkable abilities to survive exposure to antibiotics and are known
as antibiotic persisters. These bacterial persisters are thought to contribute to the relapse of many infections and
to the worrying burden of antimicrobial resistance. Understanding how bacteria establish this growth arrested
state can help to develop better antibiotics. Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) modules are widespread pairs of genes
involved in bacterial growth control. They are stress responsive systems that enable bacteria to adapt their
growth in response to insults such as attack by phage or host immune defense cells. TA systems encode a non-
secreted toxin which inhibits an essential cellular function thereby controlling growth, and an antitoxin that
neutralizes the toxin. The antitoxin exerts control over the toxin at two levels, through repression of expression
and direct neutralization. It is thought that upon stress, the antitoxin is degraded, on one hand de-repressing
expression of the operon, and on the other hand liberating the toxin. However, despite numerous studies on
toxin functions, very little information is available on how stresses lead to activation of TA systems, from “de-
repression” of the TA operon and liberation of the toxin to actual consequences of the activity of the toxin on the
bacteria; and the role of these ubiquitous elements remains disputed. The foundation of the work is our prior
demonstration that uptake of Salmonella Typhimurium by macrophages is a natural trigger of expression and
activity of each of the TA modules encoded by the bacteria. Using a combination of genetic, biochemical,
structural and imaging approaches, we will take advantage of this powerful trigger to study how TA systems of
the TacAT group are activated (de-repression in aim 1 and liberation of the toxin in aim 2) and the physiological
consequences of the activity of Tac toxins in response to attacks inflicted on bacteria by their environment
(intoxication in aim 3 and effects of intoxication in aim 4). The knowledge generated will undoubtedly provide
insight on other TA systems beyond the Tac family. In addition, it has the potential to transform our
understanding of bacterial growth heterogeneity and the associated phenomenon of antibiotic persistence and
serve as a springboard to develop better antibiotics."

Effective treatment of HIV infection has reduced the severity of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND),
however, the incidence of CNS neurological dysfunction (~50% of HIV patients) has not been diminished by the
treatment. With dramatically extended life expectancy of HIV-infected patients, neurological dysfunction reduces
the quality of life by affecting learning and executive functions, and puts these individuals at risk of developing
significant health problem. The treatment options for this co-morbidity are limited by poor understanding of its
pathogenic mechanisms in virologically suppressed patients. Several hypotheses have been suggested, ranging
from low grade chronic neuroinflammation caused by HIV infection, to neurotoxicity of HIV-related factors, to HIV
accelerating the natural development of known neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease.
Although these hypotheses are consistent with some elements of HAND, none of them explains the full
pathological manifestation of this disorder and its unique relationship with HIV infection. In this application, we
propose to test a novel hypothesis that, if confirmed, will point to the key element of pathogenesis of CNS
neurological disorder caused by HIV infection and may translate to novel treatment opportunities. We
hypothesize that the central mechanism in HIV-associated CNS disorder is the reorganization of lipid
rafts caused by HIV Nef. Changes in neuronal lipid rafts promote protein misfolding/aggregation,
exacerbate inflammatory responses, and affect neuronal communications leading to functional
impairment and eventually to neurodegeneration. Dysfunction of the lipid rafts is essential for pathogenesis
of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, pointing to a broad relevance of our hypothesis to
diseases of aging population. This hypothesis is based on our published and preliminary findings that HIV protein
Nef reorganizes lipid rafts in macrophages and neurons. We recently demonstrated that changes to lipid rafts
inflicted by Nef are similar to those found in neurons infected by prions. Importantly, recent studies have shown
that neurons exposed to Nef-containing exosomes, released by HIV-infected brain macrophages, microglia and
astrocytes, take up exogenous Nef, which is functionally active. Nef production in viral reservoirs, including brain,
continues in the presence of antiretroviral therapy. The following aims will be pursued to test this innovative
hypothesis. Aim 1: To establish the contribution of Nef to HIV-associated CNS neurological dysfunction in mouse
models; Aim 2: To determine mechanisms by which Nef released from HIV-infected cells affects cholesterol
metabolism in neurons, causing neurological dysfunction; Aim 3: To target lipid rafts as a potential therapeutic
approach to treat HIV-associated neurological dysfunction. These interconnected but independent aims will
provide an actionable model of HIV-associated CNS disorder."

In recent large-scale genome-wide analysis studies, a rare coding variant was identified in Abelson interactor
family member 3 (ABI3) gene and this variant is associated with increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease
(LOAD). ABI3 is highly conserved across multiple species, including humans and mice. Interestingly, it is highly
expressed in microglia and relatively more abundant in the hippocampus, compared to the other brain regions.
The overarching goal of this application is to understand the role of ABI3 in microglia function and the
mechanisms by which ABI3 affects the pathogenesis of AD. We propose the following Specific Aims to test our
hypotheses. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of Abi3 deletion on Alzheimer's disease pathology using two
mouse models. By performing unbiased transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we will identify the potential key
regulators of Abi3-mediated effects. We will conduct further functional and biochemical experiments to dissect
the mechanism based on these findings. In Aim 2, we will investigate the function of Abi3 in microglia cells to
understand cellular mechanisms by which Abi3 affects the pathogenesis of AD. We will utilize a genome editing
approach to delete ABI3 gene in human microglial cells. In Aim 3, we will determine the effect of ABI3 rare-
coding variant on AD pathology using ABI3 knock-in mouse model. We will perform brain imaging and
electrophysiology experiments to assess the functional effects of ABI3 risk variant. In addition, we will assess
neuropathological phenotypes in the brains. To identify the potential pathways and key regulators, we will
perform transcriptome and proteome analyses. In addition, we will perform microglial cellular assays to determine
the effects of ABI3 risk variant on microglia functions. Furthermore, we will use RNA interference approach to
knock-down the genes of our interest to dissect the mechanism behind the ABI3 risk variant-mediated changes.
The successful completion of this study will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of AD, in particular,
microglial functions mediated by Abi3. Our long-term goal is to identify new druggable targets for the effective
treatment of AD."

The immune cells of the human lung are exposed to a variety of environmental microbes and allergens with
each inhalation. As a result of these constant exposures in the setting of the lung, their properties and
functions compared to analogous immune cells in other parts of the body are evidently unique, but still poorly
understood. We have successfully used a Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) bacterial infection model in mice to
show that lung resident memory CD4+ T cells are established locally and contribute to heterotypic immunity
against related, but non-identical infections after priming with heterologous Sp exposures. Using this model, we
recently discovered that IgM+ and class-switched resident memory B cells are also established in response to
Sp infections in a manner that is independent of tertiary lymphoid structure induction. Although we observed
that the presence of the PD-L2+ memory B cell subset is required for maximum heterotypic protection, the
mechanism by which they convey protection has not been determined. Further, tissue resident memory B cells
have only been demonstrated previously in virally infected lungs containing tertiary lymphoid structures, which
were thought to be crucial to the lung memory B cell pool. Despite the lack of organized lymphoid tissue in the
Sp infection model, our preliminary data reveal that a population of lung B cells bearing markers associated
with germinal centers precedes the development of protective PD-L2+ memory B cells, coinciding with a
transient elevation in PD-1 expression on CD4+ T cells and the follicular organizational chemokine, CXCL13 in
the lung. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the establishment and function of protective lung memory B
cells in a model lacking ectopic lymphoid tissues, we will pursue the hypotheses described in the following
aims: 1) that lung resident memory PD-L2+ B cells confer heterotypic immunity against respiratory infection via
secretion of cross-reactive antibodies, and 2) that lung B cells require CD4+ T cells for the optimal generation
of protective lung PD-L2+ B resident memory cells. Even prior to the SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis
beginning in late 2019, lower respiratory infections have been a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Advancing our understanding of protective lung B cell dynamics and function in host defense
against respiratory infection will be essential for the rational design of therapeutics and preventative strategies
that will stimulate protective local B cell establishment and activity."

The NHP kidney transplant model offers unique and important pathways to the improved understanding and
implementation of novel therapies for human transplant patients. Being an outbred, large animal model with
close genetic similarities to humans allows more accurate modeling of mechanisms and drugs/drug
combinations, and virtually all recently approvedimmunosuppressive agents and strategies have beenevaluated
in a NHP model. Our group has contributed to these advances substantially for approximately three decades,
resulting in over five clinical trials arising from our NHP research. Now we propose to focus on novel strategies
to promote donor-specific tolerance, to further develop our understanding of the interrelationship between CMV
infection and alloimmunity, and to advance our strategies for addressing the T and B cell response to
alloantigens. We have developed a collaboration that allows us to interrogate the T cell and B cell receptor
repertoire of macaques and their changes in response to immune interventions. This novel tool will greatly
enhance our ability to measure the impact of therapies at the cellular level in rhesus monkeys. In addition, we
have pioneered methodologies to assess the immune response within lymph nodes of rhesus monkeys and
measure germinal center changes and changes of T follicular helper cells as a means of better understanding
the B cell response to allotransplantation. We plan to use our collective experience in rhesus monkey kidney
transplantation and biology to evaluate therapies that are translatable to human kidney transplantation and will
also use mechanistic assays that can be performed in humans. In addition to the translational benefits of the
proposed work such as donor-specific regulatory T cell augmentation, we expect to gain fundamental new
insights into B cell memory durability and the breadth of T and B cell repertoires to alloantigens and how these
change with therapy and during rejection or infection. Our proposal involves many academic and industry
collaborations that are ongoing as attested by letters of support. We will continue to train individuals who plan
careers in transplant medicine, surgery, and immunology such that they will be prepared to lead the future of our
field. The impact of this proposal has broad implications that may benefit U.S. citizens affected by end stage
renal failure or by immune-mediated illnesses or infections."
10823363,"In full response to RFA-AI-20-004, we propose to study the mechanisms of cooperativity between NKT cell and
TLR adjuvants. We have previously shown that we could use a combination of NKT cell and TLR7 adjuvants to
produce high affinity protective anti-bacterial glycan vaccines. Our goal is now to understand the mechanisms of
this cooperative effects between the two adjuvants to optimize it and produce a vaccine formulation that promotes
protection after a single administration. In addition, we contend that mechanistic studies will also allow the
limitation of the potential side effects of adjuvants. To this end, our proposal is built on two separate and
complementary specific aims: Aim 1: Evaluate endosomal TLR ligands for their ability to enhance NKT cell
responses and their B cell helper activities. We have produced nanomolar affinity anti-glycan antibodies by
combining NKT cell and TLR7 agonists. This response was dependent on NKT and CD4 T cell help. We
hypothesize that each endosomal TLR ligand may have a different enhancing effect in a combinatorial usage.
We will investigate NKT, T follicular helper, dendritic, and B cell responses by single cell technologies for RNA
and protein expression in animal models of vaccination for each TLR/NKT cell pair that we will study. B cell
receptor sequencing and pathogen challenges will be used to measure the efficacy of each combination.
Aim 2: Evaluate the importance of the co-delivery of the two adjuvants to particular cell types and
endosomal/lysosomal compartments. We hypothesize that the physical aspects of adjuvanticity with respect
to antigen uptake and delivery to processing compartments are critical. By co-delivering antigen and adjuvants
to particular cells and within chosen compartments, using synthetic chemistry to control their pairing and
separation, mechanisms of adjuvant activity will be examined. The biological consequences of this molecular
based design of adjuvant combinations will be evaluated with respect to dosage, toxicity, and efficacy. We expect
to develop robust formulations that induce protection after a single vaccine administration.
Our entire proposal is focused exclusively on vaccines aimed at developing protective B cell immunity, and our
model system is a conjugate vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae."

This R25 Research Education Module, leveraging the infrastructure of the Indiana Clinical and Translational
Sciences Institute (I-CTSI), will foster development of a diverse clinical and translational workforce within Indiana
through education and immersive experiences of learners from historically marginalized backgrounds enrolled
in Ivy Tech, our statewide community college system. The clinical and translational science workforce is lacking
diversity. This has profound negative consequences across the translational spectrum. There is strong evidence
that career exposure and experiences have a positive impact on career choices. Ivy Tech is the largest singly
accredited statewide community college system in the country, with campuses across Indiana and an
undergraduate enrollment of ~120,000. Over half of all the Black/African American or Hispanic/Latinx
undergraduate learners in the Indiana public education undergraduate system attend Ivy Tech. The numerous
majors at Ivy Tech that have connections to clinical and translational research make this an ideal platform to
engage learners into these careers. Herein, we propose to combine career exploration with an immersion
research experience to help learners develop a pathway toward the clinical and translational science workforce.
Our program has three components. The first (AIM 1), focused on broad exposure to learners about careers in
clinical and translational science, will be achieved through synchronous virtual programming across the
statewide Ivy Tech system. The second (AIM 2a), focused on immersion research experiences, will connect
learners, termed CTSI-Scholars from Ivy Tech campuses near one of the four University campuses of our I-CTSI
(Notre Dame, Purdue, Indiana-Bloomington, and Indiana-Indianapolis) into a 10-week summer experience.
These Universities each have thematic foci of clinical and translational research/science that will serve as
primary research experiences. The program will prioritize learners from historically marginalized populations as
CTSI/Ivy Tech Scholars. The third program component (AIM 2b), will provide support through a cohort-based
longitudinal mentoring/professional development, focused on career-pathway attainment over the subsequent
year. The program's efficacy will be determined (AIM 3) through evaluation of learner progression into
educational tracks/careers connected to clinical and translational science. The Overall proposal is led by a Multi-
PI team, who serve as co-Directors of Workforce Development program in the I-CTSI. They bring complementary
expertise to the leadership and are supported by an Advisory Committee of leaders at Ivy Tech and the I-CTSI
as well as numerous program staff from both entities."
10851812,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Anemia and inflammation often co-occur in chronic diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
infection, and cancer. Anemia is often refractory to treatment in these diseases, and the impact of anemia and
anemia therapies on disease outcome is poorly defined. Accordingly, there is a significant medical need to
better understand the causal links between anemia and inflammatory diseases. One of the best defined links
between anemia and inflammation is a peptide hormone called hepcidin, which critically inhibits iron release
from intracellular stores. Hepcidin levels typically increase dramatically during inflammation, and can cause
one form of anemia termed anemia of inflammation (AI). Conversely, inflammatory diseases associated with
heavy bleeding cause a distinct form of anemia known as iron deficiency anemia (IDA), in which hepcidin
levels are suppressed. The fundamental focus of this research proposal is to: i.) investigate the impact
of hepcidin on inflammatory disease, ii.) identify cellular populations expressing hepcidin and its
partner ferroportin during inflammation, and iii.) determine the impact of iron modulation by distinct
cellular population on the resolution of inflammatory diseases. I will employ innovative technical
approaches and develop new tools to define the role of hepcidin and ferroportin during chemically-induced
intestinal damage, intestinal infection, and in inflammation-induced cancer. Collectively, results from these
studies will define the regulation and functional significance of novel cellular mediators of iron within
the intestine. These findings will critically inform ongoing efforts to develop therapies targeting tissue
repair and anemia in the context of inflammatory diseases."
10840380,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Homologous recombination (HR) is important for repairing DNA double strand breaks (DSB), and thus is an
essential process in embryonic development, meiosis and suppressing tumorigenesis. HR can also be a double-
edged sword: unrepaired breaks lead to cell death; errors by HR, particularly the crossover type, can cause
extensive genome rearrangements. While the biochemical process of HR in the repair of an induced DSB has
been elucidated by various methods, two critical gaps remain regarding spontaneous HR: 1) the lesions driving
spontaneous mitotic HR (e.g. in addition to DSBs, template switching in replication initiated by single-strand nicks
can also promote HR); and 2) HR partner choice that determines whether HR is error-free or not. The two gaps
are inter-related as HR partner choice could depend on the types of initiating lesions. What determines whether
HR is error-free or not is a fundamental question of what governs genome integrity. A major technical roadblock
is the lack of scalable, genome-wide tools for studying rare spontaneous HR events in many mutants. To scale
up genome-wide HR mapping efforts, I developed sci-L3, which enables linear amplification of single-cell
genomes that scales to 1M cells, enabling generating hundreds of single-cell global HR maps per mutant for
thousands of mutants. Moreover, genetic assays require detecting “scars” in the genome as traces of repair (e.g.
in cancer mutational signature studies), which miss 99% of error-free HR between identical sister chromatids.
There is thus a critical need for unbiased global assays that detect both mutational and error-free HR. I recently
addressed this gap by developing sci-L3-Strand-seq as the first scalable mapping tool for HR between identical
sister chromatids. Our central vision is to determine how spontaneous mitotic crossovers cause genome
rearrangements by scalable single-cell assays. In Area1, we will use sci-L3 to explore the full mutant space
in hybrid yeast diploids. By generating HR maps in all the single mutants in a pooled manner (160 single-cell HR
maps/mutant for 6,000 mutants), we can simultaneously test and generate thousands of hypotheses regarding
different lesions and pathways that drive different types of genome instability events genome-wide. In Area2, we
focus on a deciding factor for whether HR is error-free or not: HR partner choice of allelic sister chromatid, allelic
homolog and non-allelic repeats. With sci-L3-Strand-seq, we propose to map all the seven classes of crossover
outcomes in two systems: mammalian cell lines and mouse embryos. In cell lines, we will investigate genome-
wide distributions of both error-free and mutational HR outcomes in the wild-type as well as hundreds of
perturbations of HR-related genes to determine factors affecting HR partner choice including (epi)genomic
contexts, 3D genome organization and HR gene knockdown. We will also develop in vivo sci-L3-Strand-seq/RNA
co-assay to dissect cell-type variation in HR partner choice in mouse embryos. In sum, this proposal pursues
cost-effective, massively parallel and genome-wide mapping of mitotic crossover outcomes as functions of
genetic perturbations and cell types by developing and applying advanced single-cell multi-omics tools."
10847426,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The UW ALACRITY Center Methods Core (MC) has made important contributions to
overcome the challenges of implementing evidence-based clinical interventions (CI) in under-resourced health
and school settings using implementation strategies (IS). Accomplishments over the last four years include
integrating human-centered design and implementation science methods to develop the Discover, Design/Build,
and Test (DDBT) framework; developing a Typology of CI/IS Modification Targets; developing a Library of
Redesign Solutions; and evaluating the impact of redesign on capacity, usability, and quality. Under the direction
of Drs. Munson and Pullmann, the next five years of UWAC funding will focus on the following aims and activities:
(1) Identifying and catalog CI/IS modification targets to improve usability, engagement, and appropriateness in
accessible nonspecialty settings; (2) Developing redesign solutions with local teams to address CI/IS
modification targets; (3) Determining if redesign affects changes in usability, engagement, and appropriateness
through changes in CI/IS modification targets. Modification targets and redesign solutions from the original,
centralized DDBT approach from the first four years will be compared to those from the local DDBT approach
proposed for the next five years via comparative qualitative analysis. The MC will accomplish these aims by
supporting application of DDBT in localized settings (i.e., DDBT will be conducted by local project redesign
teams) and synthesizing results from three R34 sized research projects, one R01 sized hybrid effectiveness-
implementation study, and multiple pilot projects. Systematic, standardized mixed methods assessments across
all studies will collect quantitative and qualitative data on adherence to the DDBT process, impacts on
engagement, usability, and appropriateness of the CI/IS, and impacts on client functioning and outcomes. Cost
data will be collected to determine the impact of the DDBT process on local resources. The MC will provide
expert methodological and technical support to all projects, such as structured trainings and supports such as
monthly consultations, templates, academic resources, worksheets, data collection portals, and mixed methods
analyses. The MC will work to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion within research activities and faculty
development. A strong dissemination plan will be implemented to ensure that products are available to the
research community."
10847432,"ABSTRACT
Evidence-based clinical interventions are often delivered with poor fidelity and abandoned by practitioners soon
after training. In response to these findings, we have worked with practitioners and clients to co-design an
automated decision support tool supporting Problem Solving Treatment (PST) for depression. PST-Aid is a web-
based app that promotes practitioner–client collaboration in the use of PST for goal setting and action planning,
which we conceptualize as an educate and reorganize implementation strategy.
We propose to further redesign PST Aid by working with stakeholder groups from our partnering OCHIN health
informatics network, which includes >300 independent community health centers across 45 states serving
>130,000 unique clients monthly. We will conduct a hybrid type III effectiveness-implementation randomized
clinical trial comparing standard PST implementation with PST implementation augmented by the PST-Aid
implementation strategy. We will test whether: 1) PST Aid results in improved implementation outcomes (initial
and sustained fidelity, adoption, reach, and reduced reactive adaptations); 2) changes in usability, engagement,
and appropriateness mediate the effect of PST Aid on implementation outcomes; and 3) PST Aid is more
effective in reducing client depressive symptoms and improving functioning.
We will train 60 practitioners from 20–30 OCHIN clinics in PST, and then randomly assign them training in PST-
Aid vs PST as Usual. We will recruit up to 350 clients with elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ-9>10), or an
average of 5–6 per each practitioner trained in PST.
Client and practitioner-centered decision-support tools embedded in electronic health records such as PST Aid
have the potential to enhance appropriateness, engagement, and usability of evidence-based interventions. The
ability of such tools to support fidelity to elements of clinical interventions like PST, while at the same time reducing
burden, would represent a major step forward for the delivery of care and would have implications for a range of
effective but seldom used interventions."
10896901,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics (DBEI) in collaboration with the Departments of Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Pediatrics, and Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine propose to continue and enhance an innovative, rigorous, and successful two- to three-year research training program for clinicians in both adult and pediatric cardiology and pulmonary clinical research. Six postdoctoral positions per year are requested.
The training program focuses on mentored research with an experienced investigator that involves didactic training and the planning, design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of an independent research project in cardiology or pulmonary clinical research, all intended to be the next step in a trainee's academic career preparing him/her for a career as an independently funded researcher. Trainees matriculate in the Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology (MSCE) program. Didactic coursework consists of required courses in epidemiology and biostatistics, the basic sciences of high quality clinical research, methodology in cardiopulmonary science, including courses in cardiopulmonary epidemiology, advanced epidemiology, protocol development, sophisticated biostatistics, and elective courses relevant to the trainees' methodologic interests. The training program is enhanced by journal clubs and clinical research conferences conducted by participating faculty; instruction in the responsible conduct of research; and a professional development series.
The objectives of the program are to: 1) train clinicians to be rigorous and independent academic investigators able to use the range of approaches available in epidemiology to address research issues in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases; 2) provide closely mentored research experiences with faculty preceptors in clinical epidemiology and cardiovascular and pulmonary medicine; and 3) strengthen the links between epidemiology and cardiovascular and pulmonary medicine.
Strengths of the proposed program are: 1) the long and continued history of successful research training programs in the adult and pediatric cardiology and pulmonary divisions using the structure provided by the DBEI, including this training program; 2) the collaborative links that have been forged among faculty with interests in clinical research in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases; 3) the comprehensive course offerings and research programs that are available to trainees; and 4) an extensive set of experienced and multidisciplinary faculty mentors with successful training records. The broad training program in the DBEI also provides an ideal environment for collaborative learning and growth. Finally, The University of Pennsylvania and the Perelman School of Medicine promote an academic environment in which basic, clinical, and translational research are encouraged and viewed as attractive career paths for physicians."
10878701,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Suicide rates are the second leading cause of death in adolescence. Suicidal ideation (SI) typically develops
in adolescence. The onset of SI is a developmental inflection point associated with pathways toward
persistent and worsening SI and other self-injurious thoughts and behaviors. SI is also associated with
significant health care costs, morbidity, and risk for mortality. Rates of physical pain increase in adolescence
alongside the developmental increase in suicide risk. The presence of physical pain is associated with a 2- to
3-fold increase in SI risk, prompting several major organizations (e.g., World Health Organization, American
Psychiatric Association, and American Foundation for Suicide Prevention) to highlight physical pain
conditions as a serious risk factor for suicide in adults and children ages 10 years and older. Multiple suicide
theories posit that suicidal thoughts and behaviors arise from the desire to escape unbearable pain, including
physical pain. However, research on the pain–suicidality link has heavily relied on cross-sectional studies
focusing on pain diagnoses (e.g., chronic pain) as a single risk factor. Yet, most individuals with a pain
diagnosis do not have SI. There is a need for longitudinal studies investigating how multiple risk factors work
together to influence SI. There is also a need to identify proximal risk for SI (e.g., over hours) given that SI
often fluctuates rapidly over short periods. We will move beyond the pain–suicidality link by investigating
factors that may influence dynamic changes in physical pain and proximal risk for SI among adolescents. We
will investigate the effects of short-term effect of social threat (threat to social status or relationships)
and individual differences in neural response to social threat on momentary increases in physical pain and
proximal risk for SI. We focus on social threat because this is an especially developmentally salient type of
threat in adolescence and has been shown to influence pain. Social threat, like physical threat, also activates
pain-related brain regions involved in a “neural alarm system” to warn against danger. Social threat is also a
robust longitudinal predictor of SI in adolescence. To address major gaps in knowledge of the role of social
threat in the pain–suicidality link, we will test components of an overarching model positing that exposure to
social threat predicts momentary increases in pain (particularly pain unpleasantness). Pain in turn is
a proximal predictor of SI. Heightened neural activation in pain-related brain regions to social threat
amplifies pain and risk for SI in the moments when social threat occurs. We will conduct a longitudinal
study of 200 youth ages 14–17 with recurrent musculoskeletal pain in limbs, back, or neck, which is common
in adolescents and associated with suicide risk. We will recruit youth with a range of pain severity, but will
oversample for high levels of pain to enrich for risk for SI. At baseline, youth will complete fMRI tasks to
measure neural response to social threat. Youth will also participate in ecological momentary assessments
of real-world fluctuations in social threat, pain, and SI over hours."
10849826,"Project Summary: Developing disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative diseases has been challenging, in part
because accurate statistical models to identify the optimal time for intervention do not exist. Models of how symptoms
worsen over time (i.e., the symptom trajectory) before and after a clinical diagnosis can help identify that optimal time.
These models can help pinpoint when a therapy could prevent a clinical diagnosis, or slow the disease after a clinical
diagnosis.
 Yet modeling the symptom trajectory is not easy even for Huntington disease, a disease for which researchers
can track symptoms in patients guaranteed to develop it. Like other neurodegenerative diseases, Huntington disease
progresses slowly over decades, so studies that track symptoms often end before clinical diagnosis. This makes time to
clinical diagnosis right-censored (i.e., a patient's motor abnormalities will merit a clinical diagnosis sometime after the
last study visit, but exactly when is unknown), leaving researchers with the challenge of trying to model the symptom
trajectory before and after clinical diagnosis without full information about when clinical diagnosis occurs. The challenge
creates a unique statistical problem of modeling the symptom trajectory as a function of a right-censored covariate, time
to clinical diagnosis.
 Tackling this problem by modeling the distribution for time to clinical diagnosis has long been thought to be
the best strategy. For years, we and others worked to develop reliable distribution models, but we found that if the
model is even slightly wrong, we get biased estimates of how the symptom trajectory changes as a function of time
to clinical diagnosis. This bias causes problems for clinical trials because they are incorrectly powered to determine
if a therapy modiﬁes the disease course with statistical signiﬁcance. We began seeking a strategy that estimates the
symptom trajectory as a function of time to clinical diagnosis without needing to accurately model the distribution for
time to clinical diagnosis. Our team developed such a strategy for a related problem: estimating a regression model
that has a covariate measured with error. Like a right-censored covariate, when a covariate is measured with error,
the covariate's true value and distribution are unknown. Rather than ﬁnding the correct distribution, our nontraditional
strategy accurately estimates the regression model even when the distribution for the covariate is mismodeled.
 Our overarching objective is to develop a similarly robust strategy when we have a right-censored covariate, which
requires tackling challenges in three new areas: noninformative censoring (Aim 1), informative censoring (Aim 2), and
handling longitudinal measures of the symptom trajectory (Aim 3). Upon completion, our work will produce robust
estimates of the Huntington disease symptom trajectory as a function of time to clinical diagnosis. The work is timely,
given recent therapies that show potential for modifying the course of Huntington disease. Correctly powered clinical
trials will enable researchers to test these therapies and determine if they modify the disease course. Our strategy could
help design these clinical trials and push forward the science of Huntington disease and other neurodegenerative diseases."
10840263,"Project Summary
Diarrheal illness is the second most common cause of non-neonatal death among young children worldwide,
and is a major cause of morbidity. Current etiologic diagnosis of diarrhea relies on microbial detection, and
decisions for antibiotics commonly empiric. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from
antibiotic use, and testing for all potential pathogens is neither financially nor logistically feasible. Thus,
methods to improve the clinical management of pediatric diarrheal illness, including strategies for antimicrobial
and diagnostic stewardship, are needed. Clinical prediction rules are potential tools to address this need, and
in this K24 application, our overall goal is to explore strategies to improve clinical decision-making for diarrhea
management, through use of spatial-temporal data and biomarkers. Dr. Leung, the PI, is a physician-scientist
with training in clinical infectious diseases, immunology, microbiology, and epidemiology, with a focus on
enteric infections, especially those that cause diarrheal illness in children in limited-resource settings. He has
mentored over 40 patient-oriented researchers (PORs) since the start of his independent research program in
2014; additionally, he has co-mentored numerous PORs in collaboration with scientists and clinicians working
in low- and middle-income countries. Leveraging infrastructure already in place from three ongoing NIH-funded
awards (R01AI130378, R01AI135114, R01AI135115), as well as Gates Foundation-funded studies, he
proposes to augment his current POR by addressing the following aims: 1) To examine the use of spatial-
temporal data for individual-level clinical prediction of pediatric diarrhea, where the use of A) serosurveillance,
B) molecular diagnostic, and C) earth observation-derived data will be explored, and 2) To identify clinical use-
cases, and potential candidates, of fecal biomarkers that complement clinical decision support tools for
management of pediatric diarrhea, using both qualitative methods to examine end-user perspectives and
identify use-cases, and metabolomics and transcriptomics methods to identify candidate biomarkers. To
accomplish these aims, he has established a co-mentoring team of experienced investigators with diverse
expertise in statistical methods, biomarker discovery, and mentoring of POR investigators. This award will
provide protected time for Dr. Leung to improve and increase his mentoring capacity of POR trainees, expand
his expertise and experience in bioinformatics, and generate data for future projects to improve the
management and knowledge of pediatric diarrheal infections."

biomarkers within the two groups to determine the oxidized biomarker profile for optimal oxygenation and
correlate their expression to the degree ofoxygen exposure and ventilator-free days."
10814177,"Malignant gliomas are the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Despite current therapeutic
approaches, most glioma patients die within one year of diagnosis. Genomic instability coupled with aberrant
regulation of cell-fate decisions in progenitor cell populations has been linked to glioma, leading to the view that
a convergence of genetic mutation and developmental context lead to tumorigenesis. Recent findings
demonstrate that a large set of developmental transcription factors are activated in gliomas. These studies
suggest that the gene regulatory programs governing glial cell formation are reutilized during glioma formation,
pointing to common transcriptional requirements for glial development and tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is critical
that we leverage our understanding of glial cell development to gain valuable insights into the biology and
treatment of gliomas. We have previously identified a gliogenic transcriptional complex – Sox9/Brn2– that is
important for the initiation of gliogenesis. We showed that in a mouse model of malignant glioma disruption of
the ability of the complex to bind DNA regulatory elements leads to decreased expression of the glial initiating
factor Nuclear Factor-IA (NFIA) and reduced tumorigenesis. Our preliminary data demonstrate that a protein
Med12 (Mediator Complex subunit 12), which is expressed during glial cell development, linked to chromatin
conformations, and implicated in cancer tumorigenesis, associates with the Sox9/Brn2 complex. Further,
reduction of Med12 expression in cortical astrocyte cultures compromises DNA chromatin conformation at the
Nfia locus. Therefore, we propose to explore the parallels between embryonic glial development and
tumorigenesis by delineating the transcriptional circuitry and regulatory landscape governing glioma
tumorigenesis. Analysis of these mechanisms is expected to identify molecular targets important in
gliomagenesis.
 We focus this proposal on the function of a transcriptional complex, important for glial cell differentiation,
-Sox9/Brn2/Med12- and its role in coordinating transcriptional mechanisms through gene regulatory elements,
and chromatin conformations during gliomagenesis. We will investigate the role of Med12 in glioma formation
and tumor cell biology using a wide range of in vitro and in vivo techniques in a novel mouse model of malignant
glioma. We will interrogate the mechanisms by which Med12 functions in mediating enhancer/promoter
interaction during glioma formation and progression by exploiting recent technological advances that allow for
examination of long-range chromatin interactions (i.e. 3C Assays). We will functionally validate downstream
target genes of the Sox9/Brn2/Med12 complex that may influence glioma formation. Together, these studies will
define how developmentally relevant transcriptional mechanisms including gene regulatory elements and
chromatin architecture interface to influence glioma biology and reveal novel gene targets potentially regulating
gliomagenesis."
10808150,"ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in industrialized nations. During the course of our studies,
we have identified previously undiscovered mitochondrial pathways of lipid metabolism and signaling which lead to
the generation of 2-arachidonoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (2-AA-LPC) and 2-arachidonoyl-
lysophosphatidylethanolamine (2-AA-LPE). These include: 1) the identification of iPLA2g (PNPLA8) as a
phospholipase with sn-1 specificity; and 2) oxidized cardiolipin-activated cytochrome c serving as a plasmalogenase
catalyzing the production of 2-AA LPC and 2-AA LPE. Further research demonstrated that 2-AA-LPC and 2-AA-LPE
are excellent substrates for cyclooxygenase-2 resulting in a plethora of unanticipated metabolites. Remarkably,
incubation of these substrates with either 12-lipoxygenase or 15-lipoxygenase resulted in their oxidation to 12-
H(p)ETE- or 15-H(p)ETE-lysophospholipids. Building upon these discoveries we identified 2-AA-LPC and 2-AA-LPE
as signaling and metabolic nodes in lipid synthesis and human heart mitochondrial function. Importantly, we have
identified the ability of failing human heart mitochondria to generate increased amounts of HETE eicosanoids in
response to Ca2+ challenge in comparison to non-failing control mitochondria. Recently, ferroptosis has been
identified as a mechanism that leads to cell death through the accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides. During myocardial
ischemia and heart failure, a substantial portion of mitochondrial iron (Fe+3) is released from its bound state to become
free Fe+2 that initiates the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through Haber-Weiss and Fenton-type
chemistries. The present research is targeted to identifying the roles of prominent mechanisms responsible for the
oxidized lipids and their roles in membrane dysfunction in failing myocardium. The proposed research will focus on
mechanistically understanding the mechanisms leading to oxidized lipid production in the failing human heart.
Specifically, we will identify the chiral enrichment in different classes of oxidized lipids to gain mechanistic insight into
future translational targets for therapy of heart failure. If lipid oxidation is largely enzyme-mediated, then specific
enzymes can be targeted that will be identified in the proposed research. Alternatively, if lipid oxidation is largely
mediated/initiated by non-enzymatic Fe+2 mechanisms then Fe chelation approaches and intramembrane radical
traps can be explored. In Specific Aim 3, we will investigate the roles of oxidized lipids in the activation of different cell
types from control and from failing hearts from female and male subjects. The importance of inflammation in heart
disease is now well documented, but the roles oxidized lipids play in activating different cells of the immune system
is still at its earliest stages of understanding. To traverse this gap in our knowledge, we will examine the effects of
different oxidized lipids on selected cells in the cardiovascular system (e.g., cardiac myocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial
cells, and macrophages). Through understanding the mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of oxidized lipids
on mitochondrial function in human hearts, a multi-tiered approach for treatment of congestive heart failure can be
realized targeting enzyme-mediated oxidation, Fe2+ mediated oxidation and terminators of free radical propagation."
10815546,"Project Summary: The long-term objective of this research project is to understand the role of dimerization in
extracellular domains (ECD) of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) in cancer. The short-term goal is to
design sunflower trypsin inhibitor (SFTI)-grafted peptides for treatment of lung cancer. Nearly 85% of lung cancer
patients have a type of cancer called non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The five-year survival rate of NSCLC
patients has not improved in more than a decade because most tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) develop
resistance to therapy within five years. Dimerization of EGFRs (EGFR, HER2, HER3) is known to play a key role
in NSCLC. Apart from EGFR, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) gene amplification and HER2
protein overexpression or mutation seem to play major roles in the development of resistance in NSCLC therapy.
Although HER2 overexpression or mutation is observed in 2-4% of NSCLC, HER2 may be a driver of both
NSCLC progression and resistance to EGFR. Understanding the details of dimers of EGFRs and inhibiting
dimerization has a significant impact on not only HER2 overexpressed but EGFR-mutated NSCLC, and this
would fill a gap in our knowledge. Inhibition of EGFRs extracellular domain dimerization has a significant impact
on its therapeutic effect on NSCLC. This will be done by targeting the clinically validated target domain IV of
human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) with peptides. However, peptides have limitations in terms of
oral bioavailability. Multicyclic peptides with a disulfide bond such as sunflower trypsin inhibitors are known to
have a stable structure that is resistant to thermal, chemical, and enzymatic degradation. These peptides can
be grafted with functional groups that can inhibit protein-protein interactions. Grafted peptides overcome the
limitations of peptides as therapeutic agents and are orally available. A grafted peptidomimetic molecule has
been designed that specifically binds to the HER2 protein and inhibits the dimerization process of EGFR proteins.
This approach is novel because the molecule designed disrupts EGFR homo- as well as heterodimers. The
molecular mechanism of how the grafted peptide inhibits EGFR dimerization and alters the signaling for cancer
is not well understood. We propose to characterize details of the mechanism of inhibition of EGFR dimerization
and the biopharmaceutical properties of the grafted peptide. As a proof-of-concept, the grafted peptide will be
evaluated in different models of lung cancer, including patient-derived cancer cell model in mice. Aims in this
project are: 1) to evaluate the molecular mechanism of protein-protein interactions of EGFRs via inhibition by
the grafted peptide and its effect on downstream signaling in HER2-activated and EGFR-resistant lung cancer
cells; 2) to evaluate the therapeutic effect of grafted peptides on reducing the growth of lung tumors in mice; 3)
to evaluate the oral availability and biopharmaceutical properties of grafted peptides. Such grafted peptides that
are orally available will have an impact on lung cancer treatments that develop resistance and on the survival
rate of lung cancer patients."
10816591,"Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has arisen as a powerful drug discovery platform for tackling the
undruggable proteome by targeting specific proteins for proteasomal degradation through the formation of
ternary complexes facilitated by either small-molecule molecular glues or heterobifunctional degraders that
bring together an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a neo-substrate protein. While this approach has exploded in
popularity in cancer drug discovery, a major challenge includes the dearth of E3 ligase recruiters despite the
abundance of >600 E3 ligases, and the very few examples of molecular glues and recruitment of neo-
substrates for degradation. Another challenge of TPD is that it cannot be applied to protein substrates which
are actively ubiquitinated and degraded like many tumor suppressors within cancer cells. To address these two
challenges, I propose to utilize chemoproteomics-enabled covalent ligand discovery platforms to
discover new E3 ligase recruiters for TPD applications and develop a new cancer drug discovery
paradigm for targeted protein stabilization (TPS) for deubiquitinating and stabilizing tumor
suppressors, through the discovery and application of deubiquitinase recruiters. Chemoproteomic
platforms, such as activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), have arisen as powerful platforms to mapping
and pharmacologically targeting proteome-wide ligandable sites. ABPP uses reactivity-based chemical probes
to profile proteome-wide reactive, ligandable, and functional sites directly in complex proteomes. Here, I will
use ABPP to discover an arsenal of covalent ligands against E3 ligases and deubiquitinases that can
be applied for TPD and TPS.
 During the F99 graduate thesis phase of my fellowship, I will expand the scope of TPD by discovering
new E3 ligase recruiters that can be used to proteasomally degrade cancer therapy targets. During this time, I
will also attend national and international conferences, hone my skills in mentoring, take courses in responsible
research conduct, hone my skills in paper and grant writing, and interview for postdoctoral positions towards
expanding my knowledge, networking, and finding an optimal postdoctoral position. My graduate research
environment is stellar at UC Berkeley and in the Nomura Research Group, where I have access to world-class
professors and have interactions with top-notch graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as cutting
edge technologies and resources. During my K00 phase, I will advance the TPS platform to develop a new
drug discovery paradigm for stabilizing the expression of tumor suppressors to develop a new type of cancer
therapy. During this time, I will also continue to attend national and international conferences, hone my skills in
mentoring, paper and grant writing, and public speaking, apply for the K99/R00 transition award, and apply for
tenure-track professor positions at top-tier research institutions."
10869902,"Project Summary/Abstract
Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality after lung
transplantation resulting in significant negative effects on quality of life and cost. PGD has a
complex relationship with donor organ use because uncertainty in organ quality and concern
that poor donor quality causes susceptibility to PGD results in high discard rates for potentially
transplantable organs. With almost 1 in 5 candidates dying awaiting lungs for transplant, calls
for new methods to define donor quality and PGD risk have become a major public health
challenge.
The long-term objective of our line of research is to prevent recipient death and expand the
donor pool through better donor selection. Recent evidence suggests innate immune activation
is important in PGD pathogenesis based on transcripts from donor lung tissue, bronchial wash
and blood. Using these transcripts, we have developed two objective gene expression based
risk assessment tools to stratify PGD risk and identify organs which may be suitable for
transplant from the pool of unused organs. Utilizing these tools, we will conduct a prospective
multicenter cohort study to externally validate our prediction tools for donor pool expansion.
Successful completion of our aims will lead to an objective marker of donor organ quality whose
application will simplify subjective decision making in donor selection and identification of new
organs for donor pool expansion."
10839446,"7. Abstract
Nearly half (47%) of people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) whose kidney function is restored after kidney
transplantation experience chronic pain compared to 19% of adults in the US general population. Pain is
associated with comorbid fatigue, depression and anxiety, and withdrawal from usual physical and social
activities; resulting in an inability to participate in and enjoy life. Severe pain can result in nonadherence to
immunosuppression and treatment protocols and result in an increased risk of rejection, graft loss, and mortality.
The role of symbiotic microbes (microbiota) in the gastrointestinal tract, and their functional genes (microbiome),
is well established in diseases involving pain. Diet and stress play a major role in synthesis of signaling molecules
critical to immunologic, metabolic, and endocrine pathways regulating chronic pain. Dietary patterns change
dramatically after transplantation, as recipients move from a restricted “renal” diet to a regular diet, often resulting
in increased consumption of foods high in sugars and fat. Moreover, psychological stress significantly impairs
the function of the microbiome, initiating biological pathways involved in pain, leading to a disproportionate pain
burden. Because the microbiome, serum metabolites, and pain are dynamic, our novel investigation will employ
a prospective repeated measures design to interrogate the dynamic temporal relationships between the
microbiome, metabolites associated with pathways regulating pain, transplantation factors (e.g.
immunosuppression, kidney function), changing dietary patterns, and perceived stress, on pain scores before
and after kidney transplantation. We posit the gut microbiome, and its byproducts, may partially explain the
underlying biological mechanisms of pain Interference in kidney disease. We will address three aims: 1) To
determine differential dynamic temporal relationships between microbial composition/functional genes and
circulating serum metabolites in KTRs with pain vs no pain, 2) To determine the moderation effects of diet and
perceived stress on dynamic temporal relationships between microbiome features, serum metabolites, and pain
scores among KTRs, and 3) To use machine learning algorithms to identify host-microbial interactions that are
causally linked to pain interference among KTRs. Because kidney function is restored, the kidney transplant
model is powerful to study the longitudinal relationships between the microbiome, circulating metabolites and
chronic pain in people with ESKD to develop patient-centered interventions to treat pain across the spectrum of
CKD."

vasoconstriction. We have developed a validated porcine model of acute PE and found that, after experimental
induction of PE with RVD, supplemental oxygen rapidly and reproducibly reduces PA pressure by 50%.
However, it is not known how supplemental oxygen reduces PA pressure and RVD, nor is it known whether the
underlying mechanisms also apply to human patients. We hypothesize that oxygen affects RVD primarily by
relieving hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and reducing PA pressure, and that this process is metabolically
driven. To study this hypothesis, we designed a mechanistic trial of supplemental oxygen in patients with acute
PE and a correlated study of PE in pigs. Setting: This study will be performed in the Massachusetts General
Hospital Emergency Department (MGH ED), Harvard Medical School (HMS), and Aarhus University, Denmark.
Patients with acute PE will be enrolled in the MGH ED by experienced clinical researchers with expertise in PE
and bedside echocardiography. At Aarhus University an experienced team of cardiologists and
anesthesiologists will perform experiments on our porcine model of PE with RVD. Metabolomics will be
performed by Metabolon and analyses will be performed at HMS. Research Plan: In the MGH ED, we will
perform a randomized, crossover trial of 80 human subjects with acute PE, evidence of RVD, and no baseline
hypoxemia. Patients will be randomized to breathe room air or 60% supplemental oxygen via facemask.
Therapy will be alternated at T=15, T=30, T=45 minutes, and then maintained for 180 minutes. After each
change and at 180 minutes, we will: 1) perform echocardiograms and calculate specific measurements to
identify the mechanisms by which supplemental oxygen changes PA pressure and RV function and, 2) draw
blood for agnostic metabolomic analyses and to test our a priori hypotheses that the regulation of
diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, PC plasmalogens, TCA-cycle intermediates, acyl carnitines, and breakdown
products of branched-chain amino acids change with supplemental oxygen. At Aarhus University, we will
experimentally induce PE with RVD in 24 pigs. As in our human experiment, we will measure PA pressure, RV
function, and circulating metabolites. We will also assess changes in pulmonary perfusion and cardiac
metabolism associated with supplemental oxygen using dual-energy computed tomography and
hyperpolarized MRI. Relevance to Public Health: PE causes >100,000 annual deaths and is the third most
common cause of cardiovascular mortality in the U.S.. This project will decipher the underlying molecular and
pathogenic changes induced by supplemental oxygen in PE. Our study design is innovative, based on strong
preclinical data, and our results may identify therapeutic targets for future clinical trials."

Malformations of brain development are a common cause of neurological disorders in children. The most
common of these neurodevelopmental disorders is the large group of malformations of cortical development
(MCD) characterized by disruption of the structure of the cerebral cortex (e.g., enhanced cell size, altered
lamination). Somatic mutations have been identified in regulatory genes of the PI3K-AKT3-mTOR (mTOR)
pathway in the brain tissue of patients with these MCD collectively termed ‘mTORopathies.’ Focal cortical
dysplasia is a particularly challenging mTORopathy due to the presence of highly epileptogenic lesions within
the cortex that are often resistant to medication and/or difficult to resect. The most common genetic variants
causing FCD are found in genes that encode protein subunits forming the GATOR1 complex: DEPDC5, NPRL2,
and NPRL3- a negative regulator of mTOR signaling. Many studies have linked variants in DEPDC5 and NPRL3
to mTOR pathway hyperactivation, MCD, and seizures, but there few studies functionally validating or modeling
variants in NPRL2 and, currently, mTOR inhibitors are not used to treat epilepsy in these patients. This project
seeks to investigate the effects of Nprl2 loss in vitro and in vivo and to identify the mTOR-dependent
transcriptomic changes that occur as a result of Nprl2 KO. The results of this proposal stand to provide a deep
functional and transcriptomic understanding of NPRL2 variant associated phenotypes, provide pre-clinical
support for the use of mTOR inhibitors in effected individuals, and identify novel therapeutic targets downstream
of mTOR that may provide precision therapy options in the future."

10813859,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dynamic regulation of mitochondrial localization is vital for the various energy demands and homeostasis
maintenance of subcellular regions. Key components governing mitochondrial motility, dynamics, anchoring, and
quality control have been identified. However, little is known about the signaling mechanisms by which neurons
coordinate mitochondrial localization in the short and long term in response to environmental and physiological
stimuli. This proper regulation of mitochondrial localization is particularly important in neurons with unique and
elongated structures that lead to a fundamental problem of a mismatch between the mitochondrial biosynthesis
site (cell body) and the high-demanding site for mitochondrial function (axon and synapse). Growing evidence
indicates that an irregular mitochondrial localization to the axon and synapse is closely associated with many
neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, nerve degeneration, and regeneration failure. This
proposal aims to elucidate how neurons regulate mitochondrial localization in two fundamental conditions
including age and injury. In addition, we propose to determine how the regulation of mitochondrial localization
affects the maintenance of neuronal function against injury and aging. This proposal is built based on recent in
vivo studies that adult neurons undergo progressively reduced mitochondrial movement. Our lab and others
have also revealed that injured neurons acutely change mitochondrial movement and localization, determining
axon regeneration ability. The underlying mechanisms by which neurons regulate mitochondrial localization in
aging and injury conditions remain poorly understood. Lack of this knowledge hinders the development of
therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and nerve injury that have been
associated with abnormal mitochondrial localization. We combine Caenorhabditis elegans genetics,
mitochondrial biology, innovative in vivo imaging, and laser axotomy to address these unmet needs. Our
preliminary data suggest that the DLK-1 MAPK signaling, a conserved pathway associated with synapse
development, axon regeneration, and progressive neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease model, could be a
novel regulator of mitochondrial localization in neurons. This proposal consists of three specific aims to answer
how neurons regulate mitochondrial localization in aging and injury conditions (Aim 1), what the role of
mitochondria in the recovery of the adult neurons after injury (Aim 2), and how the communication between
mitochondria and nucleus controls the DLK-1 signaling, thereby mitochondria function and axon regeneration
(Aim 3). We expect that our proposed experiments will achieve a new understanding of the mechanisms that
maintain the optimal function of the nervous system by regulating mitochondrial function in aging and injured
neurons. Also, our findings will provide better insight into novel therapeutic approaches to restoring neuronal
function after nerve injury."

Axonal damage occurs early in multiple sclerosis and is considered the pathologic substrate of progressive
disability. The spatiotemporal dynamics of axonal loss in relation to acute and chronic demyelination are not well
characterized and likely vary between patients, lesion types, and within the normal-appearing white matter
(NAWM). With the emergence of promising therapies targeting remyelination, noninvasive imaging markers with
greater specificity to axonal pathology are needed to improve our understanding of disease progression in MS.
Histopathological analyses of MS tissue have confirmed significant reductions in axon density within lesions and
NAWM accompanied by a range of morphological alterations in axonal structure, including the appearance of
ovoids, swelling, thinning, and transection. We have demonstrated the imaging correlates of axonal swelling and
loss in the corpus callosum of MS patients using high-gradient diffusion MRI, leveraging the 300 mT/m gradient
strengths on the Connectome scanner for the in vivo microscopic assessment of axonal structure.
 Our goal is to validate these cross-sectional imaging findings through longitudinal investigation and
systematic comparison against histopathology to gain a better understanding of the spatial and temporal
evolution of axonal degeneration in MS and the pathogenic factors influencing disease progression. We
hypothesize that chronic demyelination leads to axonal swelling and eventual dropout that can be detected as
increased axonal size and decreased density by high-gradient diffusion MRI, and that the degree of axonal
morphologic change throughout the brain reflects progressive axonal dysfunction and manifests as progressive
clinical disability. We will pursue a longitudinal imaging study to determine the relationship between
demyelination and progressive axonal structural pathology in MS lesions and NAWM throughout the whole brain.
We will evaluate the relative influence of demyelination and axonal damage on the development of progressive
physical disability and cognitive dysfunction in MS. In collaboration with investigators at the Cleveland Clinic, we
will calibrate and refine diffusion MRI measures of axon diameter and density in MS lesions and NAWM against
axon diameter and density measurements from histopathology in postmortem MS brain tissue.
 The prevalence of axonal loss in postmortem samples, and the absence of a reliable biomarker for axonal
loss in living patients, reinforces the need for a validated imaging correlate of axonal degeneration that would
allow us to track changes in axonal structure in real time rather than at their end stage on autopsy specimens.
High-gradient dMRI techniques that map axon diameter distributions in MS patients will enable us to corroborate
the changes in axon diameter observed on pathology. The data generated from this study will advance our
understanding of the role of axonal damage in the pathogensis of MS and facilitate the development of clinically
usable in vivo imaging markers of axonal structural pathology to aid in patient selection and assessment of
treatment response in trials of neuroprotective therapies in MS."

Despite an incidence of 1:8,000-1:18,000, biliary atresia (BA) is the leading indication for pediatric liver
transplantation. BA is a progressive fibrostenotic disease of the extrahepatic biliary tree of unknown etiology.
The Kasai portoenterostomy (KP), a surgical procedure to allow bile flow, is currently the only treatment for BA
besides liver transplant. Successful bile flow after KP improves morbidity and predicts early liver-transplant free
outcomes.2,3 However 50% of infants who receive a timely KP require liver transplant or die in the first two
years of life.7,8 Thus, there is desperate need to understand the pathophysiological factors responsible for the
absence or presence of bile flow after KP. Recent investigations suggest that there is bidirectional interplay
between the intestinal microbiome and bile acid homeostasis. While bile can change the microbiome, due to
our exciting preliminary data, we believe that microbial factors may be key to BA outcomes. Thus, the grant’s
hypothesis is that the microbiome influences BA outcomes by affecting bile flow. A prospective study of
microbiome in infants with cholestasis and BA will allow testing of this hypothesis in 3 aims. In aim 1, a multi-
center prospective stool biobank from cholestatic infants will be developed. In aim 2, the effects of bile flow on
early microbial signatures will be compared using whole genome sequencing in infants with cholestasis. In aim
3 microbial signatures associated with positive outcomes in BA will be identified. The expected outcome is that
we will elucidate the complex relationship of the microbiome and bile flow in infants with cholestasis,
specifically BA.
 Dr. Tessier is a board-certified pediatric gastroenterologist and tenure-track Assistant Professor at
Baylor College of Medicine. Her long-term goal is to become an independent NIH-funded physician-scientist
investigating the interactions of the microbiome in pediatric cholestasis. The research aims support the PI’s
career development by building on her background in pediatric gastroenterology to provide master’s level
training in clinical trial design and implementation, microbiome and whole genome sequencing analysis and
biostatical interpretation. This will be fulfilled via 1) A mentorship and advisory team which includes
internationally-recognized, independently funded investigators with an expertise in pediatric cholestasis,
particularly BA, the infant microbiome, and clinical trial design; 2) advanced course work in bioinformatics,
advanced sequencing technologies and biostatistics; and 3) scholarly activities to lead to independence.
 Finally, the candidate’s research environment is a preeminent academic research institution in the
world’s largest medical center allied with the nation’s largest children’s hospital. This environment will provide a
productive and collaborative atmosphere to accomplish her research and training goals in a timely manner. In
summary, this training plan will allow Dr. Tessier to become an independently funded physician scientist in
patient-oriented research, pediatric cholestasis and microbiome."

The ability of experimentalists to investigate biological systems has often been limited to pre-programmed
open-loop protocols whereby systems are probed based on assumptions and predetermined models. In
contrast, real-time feedback control allows systems to be dynamically probed with parameter perturbations
calculated as functions of instantaneous closed-loop system measurements, enabling researchers to
address questions not amenable to open-loop approaches. While there are many biological problems that
can be made more tractable by such feedback control – such as dynamic probing of ion-channel function in
neurons or manipulation of sleep network dynamics using auditory and electrical stimuli governed by real-
time EEG feedback – technical complexities often hinder its adoption.
Because there has been a many-decades advance in computing technologies, it is counter-intuitive that
real-time experiment control is not possible with standard computer operating systems (without expensive
add-on components). They are simply not designed for such strictly timed tasks. Furthermore, commercial
real-time systems are costly and require end-user customization for the lab, such that they are typically not
portable to the broader scientific community. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a fast and
highly versatile real-time biological experimentation system – the Real-Time eXperiment Interface (RTXI).
RTXI is free and open source, compatible with an extensive range of experimentation hardware, and
delivers reproducible, hard real-time performance via a user-tailorable interface on standard laboratory
computers. Importantly, RTXI offers extensive versatility and high-performance to “power users,” while
simultaneously providing a rich – and ever growing – library of experiment-control modules that require little
effort for those who are not computationally savvy.
RTXI has grown to the point where it is now an invaluable part of the scientific programs of many leading
research groups. In addition to updating and maintaining RTXI for those, and future, users, there remain
important avenues for development that would substantially expand RTXI’s functionality, reproducibility
enhancement, and utility for an even broader group of biological researchers. Thus, we propose:
1. To keep RTXI pushing scientific innovation by overhauling its base code and core modules.
2. To enable several new real-time experiment paradigms.
3. To ease and enrich experimentalists’ user experience and reproducibility.
Critically, the work proposed here will ensure that RTXI remains a valuable research tool for its varied
group of outstanding biological scientist end users. Furthermore, we will expand RTXI’s utility significantly
by building and supporting additional classes of experiments and the groundbreaking science they will
enable."

The overarching objective of this Program Project Grant is to understand fundamental
mechanisms underlying communication between cancer cell genomic instability and the immune
system. Foundational work from the investigators on this P01 demonstrates multivariate ways in
which genomic damage is aberrantly detected as “foreign” by pattern recognition receptors that
are typically used to sense viral nucleic acids. The collective body of work from our groups
establish that DNA damage, changes in tissue architecture, mitotic errors, and nuclear envelope
fragility serve to breach cell intrinsic barriers that prevent endogenous DNA and RNA from
detection by innate immune pattern recognition sensors. These events critically affect the tumor
microenvironment to either promote or suppress tumor growth. To achieve our goals, we have
assembled three Projects that will work closely with three Cores to address critical questions on
detection of genome instability in tumors by the immune response. Project 1 investigates the
relationship between DNA damage responses and pattern recognition of endogenous DNA and
RNA in the cytoplasm. Project 2 tests hypotheses on how disruption in tissue architecture and
mechanical forces result in chromosome missegregation and instability. It describes an approach
to understand innate immune system recognition of this instability. Project 3 investigates in vivo
responses to DNA damage within tumors, while designing rational approaches to enhance anti-
tumor immune activation. Integration of these multidisciplinary projects with Mammalian Artificial
Chromosome and Chemical Biology Cores will advance our primary goal of defining the molecular
basis for immune detection of genome instability in cancer."

The ability of recently activated T cells to express the cell surface molecule CD40L allows them to
communicate with other immune and non-immune populations. This molecule is of particular importance in the
gut to help control the parasitic infection caused by Cryptosporidium. Here we leverage a novel, natural mouse
model of Cryptosporidium to dissect the impact of the CD40-CD40L interaction in T cell-mediated resistance to
infection in the gut. In this model, WT mice (like humans) develop sterile immunity mediated by T cell
production of IFN-γ, but mice that lack CD40L mice (like humans) do not resolve infection. In addition,
treatment of chronically infected CD40L-deficient mice with soluble (s)CD40L results in rapid parasite
clearance. We will test if protective effect of CD40L may be explained by either I. its ability to promote T cell
responses essential for resistance and/or II. because CD40L directly activates EC to limit parasite growth. We
are uniquely equipped to utilize parasite transgenesis, combined with sophisticated genetic approaches to
define the key cellular interactions that allows CD40L to determine the outcome of an enteric infection."

Progress in HIV prevention in the United States (US) has stalled, according to reports from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Most recently, the Department of Health and Human Services has made
Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) a national priority, with intermediate goals of a 75% reduction within five
years and a 90% reduction in 10 years. Getting to Zero (GTZ) programs rely on the concept of combination
HIV prevention, using evidence-based methods that have been tailored to suit local needs. Among each of
these programs is an emphasis on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which is a versatile tool able to prevent
acquisition of HIV infection within diverse HIV-risk communities. Despite the success of PrEP in efficacy trial
settings, uptake has been slow in the US and highly variable: coverage among those with indications for PrEP
is estimated to range from 5-41% (median 18%), among US states.
Agent-based stochastic modeling is highly equipped to investigate complex epidemiologic questions, such as
the effects of the PrEP continuum in diverse settings, populations, and as part of combination HIV prevention.
The HIV Calibrated Dynamic Model (HIV-CDM), simulates HIV testing, transmission, treatment, and
prevention among a wide range of epidemic settings and is able to address the crucial questions facing PrEP
implementation in the US. Using the HIV-CDM, we propose to address the following aims:
Specific Aim 1: To expand and calibrate the current HIV-CDM to capture the epidemic dynamics, HIV risk
behavior, network mixing, and access to HIV prevention modalities within the most prominent GTZ programs
and priority settings throughout the US, using empirical data from ongoing and completed studies among
MSM, men who have sex with men and women, people who inject drugs, and high-risk heterosexuals.
Specific Aim 2: To simulate the PrEP continuum in eight key US cities, including PrEP eligibility within
specific populations, access, retention, and adherence. To inform these simulations, and generate estimates
for PrEP utilization up to 10 years into the future, we will integrate empirical data for each step of the
continuum. This will include a focus on both the development and testing of diverse PrEP eligibility measures,
including electronic health record-based algorithms, clinical checklists, and CDC guidelines.
Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the potential to reduce HIV incidence by 75% in five years, and 90% in 10 years,
through targeted PrEP expansion, within the context of existing combination prevention packages in settings
with a history of HIV prevention successes (e.g., Boston and San Francisco), settings that have struggled in
their GTZ efforts (Miami, Atlanta), and largely-rural settings (Birmingham) that are priority areas for the EHE
initiative. This approach will include network-based analyses that will investigate the most efficient methods
of PrEP delivery within heterogenous epidemics."

Women involved with the carceral system are more at risk of HIV infection, substance use disorders, and
overdose than their community-based counterparts. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has emerged as a
powerful HIV-prevention tool and in combination with Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) could
significantly impact HIV and overdose risk. Patient navigation holds strong potential to address multifactorial
and complex barriers to PrEP and substance use treatment linkage and uptake for women involved in the
carceral system. In tandem with patient navigation, eHealth has the potential to improve healthcare
engagement for this group of women. As a multidisciplinary team with expertise in HIV-prevention
implementation science research, technology enhanced, gender-responsive, and behavioral health focused
(substance use, mental health and HIV prevention) interventions, and intervention development for individuals
involved in the carceral system, we propose to examine the potential impact of using a technology-based
adjunct to an existing navigation program to improve linkage to PrEP and MOUD for women leaving carceral
settings in Philadelphia (PA). Intervention development and study design will be guided by our team’s pilot and
on-going research, and the EPIS Implementation Framework. Study aims are to: 1) Assess women involved in
the carceral systems’ perceptions of PrEP and MOUD and potential barriers to initiation and adherence; 2)
Develop the PA-Links web-based app and assess usability and acceptability; and 3) Pilot the intervention to
assess for promise of efficacy in engaging women involved in the carceral systems in PrEP and MOUD by
integrating PA-Links into existing patient navigation. A survey of women involved in the carceral system and
perceptual mapping analyses will be used in Aim 1 to guide proto-type app development and user testing in Aim
2. In Aim 3, we will examine the primary outcome of PrEP and MOUD service linkage and secondary outcomes
such as PrEP and MOUD prescription/initiation, PrEP and MOUD adherence/persistence, perceptions and
knowledge, and acceptability of the intervention. A Community Advisory Board will inform all aspects of the
proposed study. This pilot study will significantly contribute to the field of HIV and substance abuse treatment by
examining the potential impact of using technology based, tailored, gender-responsive interventions in adjunct
with existing navigation in an urban, community-based health center. Study results will provide crucial
information for a subsequent R01 proposal to rigorously evaluate an urgently needed HIV prevention
intervention developed specifically to meet the unique cultural and social needs of high-risk women."

notable increases in applications from TG-eligible students as well as the increase in Yale neuroscience
faculty, tuition and stipend support is requested for an additional seventh student for each year (a total of 14
students). The faculty of the INP’s T32 JSPTPN consists of 83 neuroscientists from the Arts and Sciences
(FAS) and the Yale Medical School (YMS). For the 2019/2020 academic year there are 82 predoctoral (NOT
including our 22 MD-PhD students working full time in lab) graduate students, of which 50 are TG-eligible. The
INP is directed by Charles Greer and Haig Keshishian and supervised by an executive committee
representing a cross-section of INP faculty and graduate student representatives. Greer and Keshishian
serve as the Program Directors for the INP’s T32 Training Program. The INP receives strong university
support, including salaried administrators, office space, 8 full fellowships with tuition, and stipend
supplementation. The doctoral program undergoes scheduled reviews by the Graduate School as well as our
own anonymous reviews from students and faculty and an outside advisory committee. The INP is part of
Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS) umbrella program, but students are admitted directly into the INP
through a neuroscience admissions committee. Upon affiliating with the INP the students remain in the
interdepartmental program through their graduation. On average over the past funding cycle, 171
US/permanent resident students have applied annually, with 32% offered admission, for an entering class
averaging 11 students (2019/2020 class: 17 US students). The INP is actively involved in educating students
from underrepresented groups. Since 2015 20% (2019/2020 = 41%!) of the US/permanent resident
neuroscience students in the program were from these groups. Students are supervised by the Co-Directors,
an executive committee, and through longitudinal mentoring beginning with matriculation. All INP students take
four core graduate classes in neuroscience, quantitative skills and bioethics, two advanced course electives,
and two 1st year research rotations. They attend invited seminars, research in progress talks, an annual retreat
and the Society for Neuroscience meeting at the program’s expense. In the 2nd year the students select a
doctoral adviser from the pool of participating faculty. They also take the doctoral qualifier examination, which
has tutorial, written, and oral components. The students advance to candidacy for the PhD upon defending a
prospectus in the 3rd year. All students are provided travel funds to attend and present their work at national
meetings. A PhD in Neuroscience is awarded to graduates by the INP."

precursors. My lab has studied these processes for many years, including recently how they function in
differentiation and disease. This proposal continues our studies on these topics, and can be divided into the
following areas. mRNA processing in cancer. Work investigating how mutations in genes encoding splicing
factors lead to MDS and other neoplasms will be continued, with an emphasis on SF3B1. Studies to elucidate
both the mechanism(s) by which SF3B1 mutations affect splicing as well as the pathways that are
dysregulated and lead to disease will be pursued. With respect to mechanism, an immediate goal will be to
continue characterizing the SF3B1-interacting region of SUGP1. Another goal is to identify the SUGP1-
interacting RNA helicase and determine its function in normal BP recognition, which will then allow
determination of the detailed mechanism by which SF3B1 mutations disrupt splicing. With respect to pathways,
experiments to elucidate the details of the recently described MAP3K7/p38/GATA1 pathway that underlies
anemia in MDS will be performed. Missplicing events that affect other relevant pathways, such as aberrant
activation of NF-kB, will be studied. FUS and other RBPs in ALS/FTD. With respect to FUS, experiments to
analyze FUS nucleocytoplasmic homeostasis, a process important for formation of toxic cytoplasmic FUS
aggregates, will be continued. Evidence supporting a gating mechanism involving the NPC and interactions
with specific nucleoporins, themselves implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), will be pursued. Suggestions that this process may
involve cell-type specificity, with MNs perhaps being more permissive, will be investigated. Experiments
pursing the observation that RBP aggregates and consequent missplicing occur in a large fraction of sporadic
ALS/FTD patient brains in the absence of known mutations will be continued. Aggregates will be isolated from
motor cortex samples and protein/RNA composition determined to investigate what might nucleate their
formation. Regulation of PA factor activity by AS. Experiments investigating the functions of isoforms of the
polyadenylation (PA) factor WDR33 will be pursued. Two short isoforms, v2 and v3, are produced by intronic
PA), and v2 but not v3 is an inner nuclear membrane protein not directly involved in PA. Interacting proteins of
both will be identified, and results suggesting they are upregulated by an NF-kB pathway will be pursued.
Evidence that the two isoforms function in the antiviral response, including to SARS-CoV-2 infection, will be
further investigated. The finding that 45 isoforms of the PA factor Fip1 are produced in humans will be
explored. eRNAs as mRNAs. Results suggesting that certain nuclear unstable lncRNAs, including eRNAs, are
stabilized, exported to the cytoplasm and in some case translated, will be pursued. Observations that up to 5%
of eRNAs contain significant ORFs and may be translated when the exosome cofactor Mtr4 is depleted will be
further investigated. The possible physiological significance of eRNA “activation” will be studied in
differentiated hESCs, which were shown to have sharply reduced levels of Mtr4."

Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the South had the highest rate of new HIV diagnoses (48%) and
the 2nd highest rate of HIV prevalence (31%) among MSM of all races in 2018. Furthermore, racial disparities
exist in terms of viral suppression, with 52% of Black MSM living with HIV achieving viral suppression compared
to 61% of White MSM. An extensive body of research has identified multiple co-occurring psychosocial factors
and structural factors that contribute to racial disparities in HIV diagnoses, prevalence, and outcomes among
Black MSM. This combination constitutes a syndemic, “the interaction of 2+ factors or health conditions” that
increase HIV among Black MSM. At the same time, mounting evidence suggests social support as an effect
modifier of viral suppression among Black MSM experiencing a syndemic. To date, no study has sought to
identify the subgroups of Black MSM living with HIV in Florida who could benefit from a shared biobehavioral
HIV intervention to improve social support and viral suppression based on their shared characteristics. Therefore,
the overarching goal of the K01 award is to provide me with the resources, training, mentoring and knowledge
needed to examine the intersectionality of public health, substance use and HIV, and syndemic research. In this
proposal, I will employ the explanatory sequential mixed method design to accomplish the specific aims which
include: 1a) application of latent class analyses (LCA) for the identification of heterogeneous syndemic classes
among Black MSM living with HIV; 1b) expansion of existing literature to examine the association between
syndemic classes and demographics; 2) validation of syndemic classes on scales assessing social support; 3)
exploration of syndemic class group differences on measures of baseline level and one-year change in viral
suppression; and 4) application of semi-structured interviews to validate and contextualize quantitative findings.
These goals will be accomplished by leveraging existing data, participants, and resources from an ongoing
NIAAA-funded observational longitudinal study (U24AA022002) and interviewing a sample of 20 Black MSM
living with HIV in Florida. This K01 application will build on my expertise in HIV outreach, public health, qualitative
research, and clinical intervention research related to substance use and HIV with advanced training in: applying
a syndemic framework to Black MSM, using LCA to model syndemic conditions among Black MSM, recruiting
Black MSM into biobehavioral HIV research, identifying effective biobehavioral HIV interventions and strategies

10932110,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 India has the third-highest number of persons with HIV. One-quarter of deaths among persons with HIV
are due to TB. Undernutrition is the leading risk factor for TB in India. TB transmission from HIV-negative
persons likely fuels the TB epidemic among Indian persons with HIV. I hypothesize that population-scale
nutritional interventions would reduce TB incidence and mortality among persons with and without HIV. I also
hypothesize that, in an Indian context, in-kind nutritional supplementation would be more cost-effective than
cash transfers.
 Models allow us to generate representations of real-world problems in mathematical language which can
be used to gain insights and to make projections. The proposed Nutritional Interventions to End Tuberculosis
among persons with HIV in India (NUTRIENT-India) study will have the following aims:
 1. Quantify the long-term impact of population-scale nutritional interventions on TB incidence and mortality
 among persons with and without HIV in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu using a microsimulation model
 2. Estimate the impact and cost-effectiveness of a variety of nutritional interventions to decrease TB
 incidence & mortality among persons with and without HIV
 For aim 1, we will develop the microsimulation model and validate it. We will then calibrate the model using
data from national health surveys and primary data from the ongoing TB Learning the Impact of Nutrition
(LION) study of nutritional interventions. For aim 2, we will synthesize evidence on the impact of cash
transfers and in-kind transfers on nutritional status of recipients. Next, we will adapt an existing Markov model
to simulate three different nutritional interventions: 1) 2600 Kilocalories (Kcal)/d of food, 750 Kcal/d of food, and
Rs 500/month cash transfer. We will obtain cost estimates from the TB-LION study and NTEP programmatic
costs. After calibrating the model using data from TB-LION and the Regional Prospective Observational
Research on Tuberculosis (RePORT)- India consortium, we will conduct cost-effectiveness analysis of the
three different nutritional interventions.
 The NUTRIENT-India study will help quantify the long-term impact of nutritional interventions on TB
incidence and mortality among persons with and without TB in India, The study will also define the most cost-
effective nutritional interventions in the Indian context. Thus, it will inform policymakers on why they must
address this critical TB risk factor that keeps TB entrenched in India and how they can intervene while making
maximal use of available resources."

Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that latently infects many hosts, including humans.
Successful latent infection requires T. gondii to evade cytokine-induced, cell intrinsic responses and
switch from a fast-growing form to a slow-growing encysted form. In humans, this life-long infection
occurs in the brain where T. gondii can reactivate in the setting of acquired immune deficiencies. In
AIDS patients, toxoplasmic encephalitis is the most common cause of focal brain lesions and can
cause prolonged neurologic deficits even after appropriate treatment. Recent studies also suggest that,
even in HIV+ patients on effective antiretroviral therapy, persistent T. gondii infection may adversely
affect cognition and global immune responses. Despite its clinical importance, we lack a mechanistic
understanding of what is actually responsible for T. gondii’s pathogenesis in the CNS, including what
enables long-term latent infection. Such understanding is crucial to eventually preventing symptomatic
disease in HIV/AIDs patients. Within the CNS, cysts are primarily found in neurons. Based on limited in
vitro and in vivo studies, it has been presumed that while infected astrocytes cleared intracellular
parasites, neurons did not and thus were the de facto host cell for persistent infection. In the last
decade, our pioneering work has questioned this model, including showing that IFN-γ-stimulated
neurons mount anti-parasitic defenses. As most of this work has occurred in murine models and
neurons, it will have missed human neuron-specific pathways (e.g., humans lack the terminal IFN-γ
dependent proteins used by murine cells to kill intracellular parasites). The goal of this grant is to
address this gap by establishing robust stem cell derived human neuron models (hPSC neurons) which
can be used to mechanistically define human neuron-T. gondii interactions that enable immune evasion
and persistence. To accomplish this goal, our will leverage our synergistic expertise in CNS
toxoplasmosis (Dr. Koshy) and stem cell biology (Dr. Churko) to generate Cre reporter hPSC neurons
and CRISPRi-expressing hPSC neurons (Aim 1) and to begin to define the mechanisms by which
cytokine stimulated hPSC-neurons control T. gondii (Aim 2). With the completion of these aims, we will
have established and validated tools that will form the essential foundation of a long-term program to
molecularly define the neuron-T. gondii interactions that enable control and persistence of T. gondii in
human neurons. The work proposed here represents an important first step toward developing human
neuron-specific therapies for acute and chronic toxoplasmosis. Such therapies will be of great benefit
for the HIV/AIDS population at risk for toxoplasmic encephalitis."

10844551,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Serious injection-related infections (SIRIs), including infective endocarditis, bacteremia, osteomyelitis, epidural
abscess, and septic arthritis have more than doubled since 2002 due to the opioid epidemic, causing morbidity,
mortality, and costing more than $700 million annually. Growing evidence suggests that medications for opioid
use disorder (MOUD) which include methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone reduce
readmission and death following SIRIs. In response to this emerging data, programs and studies seek to
optimize MOUD initiation in hospitals. However, the benefits of MOUD have not been fully realized due to
limited retention in treatment with MOUD after hospitalization. To date, there has been a paucity of research
focused on MOUD retention, the crucial next step of the opioid use disorder (OUD) care continuum. Further,
evidence-based MOUD retention interventions have not been adapted for individuals with SIRIs who have
riskier injection practices, greater medical complexity, mortality, and costs than others with OUD. The
Recovery Management Checkups model is a proactive, peer-delivered, motivational interviewing-based MOUD
retention intervention that increased retention by 50% in outpatient addition treatment and following
incarceration. It has been piloted in multiple settings, making it a promising intervention for individuals with
SIRIs who face unique challenges following their infections. Therefore, the central objective of this proposal is
to determine individual and group factors associated with MOUD treatment along the OUD care continuum in
the critical 12 month period after a SIRI and to use these insights to adapt and test Recovery Management
Checkups for this new population. This proposal includes three aims: 1) Examine MOUD treatment along the
OUD care continuum in the 12 months after SIRIs; 2) Informed by the findings from Aim 1, adapt the Recovery
Management Checkups MOUD retention model for individuals with SIRIs; 3) Conduct a pilot randomized
controlled trial of the adapted intervention to promote MOUD retention and re-engagement for individuals with
SIRIs. The findings from these Aims address a gap in current research and will inform care for individuals with
SIRIs, a priority area for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Dr. Kimmel, an early-career investigator is the PI
and will use this Career Development Award to develop skills in modeling approaches to address recurrent
events (e.g. multiple treatment episodes) and group membership (e.g. latent classes) in treatment retention
data, qualitative methods, intervention adaptation and development, and clinical trials design. Developing
these skills will position him to lead impactful research that will improve the care and outcomes for very high-
risk individuals who use drugs. Dr. Kimmel will work closely with a mentorship and advisory team with
experience in addiction medicine, infectious diseases, biostatistics, qualitative methods, intervention adaptation
and development and clinical trials to accomplish his research and training Aims."

 Matt Queen & Amanda Obery
Improving student access to quality biochemical and STEM education has been a focus of rural
educational reform for many years. Positive experiences for students prior to middle school are
critical given research showing that students who have an interest in STEM in middle school are
significantly more likely to pursue careers in these fields than those who aren’t interested. As
part of a holistic approach to this issue, the Atomic Circus Experience (ACE) Project builds on
the power of collaborative partnerships and community engagement, shown to be effective
ways in working with rural and Native students. Centering on fifth grade students, the ACE
Project seeks to build knowledge and interest in biomedical and STEM careers throughout
Eastern Montana including rural and tribal communities. To accomplish this goal, the ACE
project will work with local teachers, and biomedical professionals to develop a culturally-
relevant, place-based biomedical and STEM curriculum, ensuring all students can identify and
have role models in these fields. The curriculum will focus on increasing biochemical content
knowledge and career aspirations by engaging students through a problem-based learning
approach based on local phenomena. The curriculum is reinforced using a traveling,
community-customized, multimedia biochemical stage show featuring actors, a full rock band,
and a troupe of interpretive dancers. In addition to the work done with the schools, a community
engagement night will offer a public showing of the show will also feature a research bus open
house and accompanying INBRE-based biomedical researcher. The ACE Project will travel to
six communities in Eastern Montana, impacting approximately 7,200 students over the course of
5 years. Overall, this project is innovative in its multifaceted approach to working with rural and
Native students and calls upon promising, yet under-used, approaches in culturally relevant and
place-based pedagogies, based in the Next Generation Science Standards, in order to make
lasting changes in communities around support for biomedical and STEM fields."
10895274,"PROJECT SUMMARY: We are interested in understanding how lipid-metabolizing enzymes and lipid transport
proteins function and are regulated at the molecular and structural level. Previously, we focused on two enzymes
in phosphatidic acid (PA) metabolism: lipin and phospholipase D (PLD). Lipins are PA phosphatases that
dephosphorylate PA to generate diacylglycerol, which is the penultimate step in triglyceride biosynthesis. Lipins
regulate phospholipid and lipoprotein synthesis, fat storage as triglycerides, fatty acid synthesis, and insulin
sensitivity with implications to obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. PLDs hydrolyze
phosphatidylcholine to produce the lipid second messenger PA in response to extracellular stimuli. Receptor-
mediated activation of PLD regulates vesicular trafficking, cell proliferation, and cell migration, which has
established them as therapeutic targets for cancer. Despite extensive studies on these highly regulated, multi-
domain enzymes, significant gaps remain in our knowledge of their molecular mechanisms of action. During the
past funding period, we determined the first structures of lipin and PLD, identified a new type of membrane-
binding domain in lipins, and provided insight into PLD activation by lipids and protein effectors. These
discoveries provide an excellent foundation for this application, where our main goals include 1) continuing to
understand how PLD is activated by protein effectors and lipids, and 2) examining the molecular mechanisms
regulating lipin PA phosphatase activity and PA substrate specificity. We will also 3) biochemically and
structurally characterize the nuclear envelope protein phosphatase complex CTDNEP1-NEP1R1, which
dephosphorylates lipin to control lipin PA phosphatase activity; and 4) study the structure and function of Nir lipid
transfer proteins, which transfer PA and phosphatidylinositol between membrane contact sites to replenish pools
of plasma membrane phosphoinositides after hydrolysis by PLC. Structural studies will be complemented by an
array of lipid biochemistry and lipid-protein interaction assays that we are well versed in, hydrogen-deuterium
exchange mass spectrometry, and cellular studies in mammalian cells. A network of collaborators who are
leaders in their respective fields supports these studies. We aim to answer several major questions: (1) How
does the structure of lipid-modifying enzymes allow them to recognize their lipid substrates and interact with the
membrane? (2) What role do structurally and/or functionally uncharacterized domains play in the action of these
proteins? (3) How are these enzymes/proteins regulated? Specifically, are they autoinhibited? how do protein
effectors, lipids, ions, and post-translational modifications regulate activity? and what conformational changes
occur during activation? Overall, this work will improve our understanding of biological mechanisms and provide
information on lipid-protein interactions of physiological and pharmacological significance."
10840283,"ABSTRACT
 Permanent disabilities following central nervous system (CNS) injuries result from the failure of injured
axons to re-build functional connections. There are currently no therapies to restore mobility and sensation
following spinal cord injury or vision after optic nerve damage. The poor intrinsic regenerative capacity of
mature CNS neurons is a major contributor to the regeneration failure and remains a major problem in
neurobiology. In contrast, peripheral sensory neurons successfully switch to a regenerative state after axon
injury. The long-term goal of my research program is to understand the multicellular mechanisms by which
injured sensory neurons activate a pro-regenerative program and identify potential targets for future treatment
of CNS injuries.
 Activation of an axon growth program relies in part on the expression of regeneration-associated genes.
Because individual gene based approaches have yielded limited success in axon regeneration, we are
focusing on epigenomic regulations, which affect globally, yet specifically a combination of multiple genes. Our
goal is to uncover how the epigenetic landscape is re-organized in the context of axon injury to enable axon
repair. These studies will incorporate cell-type specific epigenomic analyses to study the transcriptional and
chromatin conformation changes elicited by peripheral and central axon injury. Axon regeneration is not cell
autonomous and is influenced by the environment at the level of the axon injury site and at the level of the cell
soma. We have recently discovered that satellite glial cells, the main type of glial cells in sensory ganglia
respond to axon injury and contribute to the repair process. We propose to use powerful combinations of tools
to pursue an innovative line of research aimed at dissecting the multicellular mechanisms orchestrating axon
regeneration and build upon these findings to improve regeneration in CNS models. To achieve this goal, we
will determine the intrinsic neuronal mechanisms controlling axon regeneration, focusing on epigenomics
studies. We will elucidate the contribution of the microenvironment surrounding neuronal soma to the axon
regeneration process, including satellite glial cells and other non-neuronal cells. To determine if findings made
in the mouse model system are predictive of human physiology, we will determine the molecular profile of
human cells surrounding sensory neurons. Finally we propose to manipulate novel pathways we discover to
improve regeneration in two CNS models, spinal cord injury and optic nerve injury. This proposal will use
powerful combinations of tools to pursue an innovative line of research aimed at dissecting the multicellular
mechanisms orchestrating axon regeneration and build upon these findings to improve regeneration in CNS
models."

leads to well-trained scientists.” According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, the undergraduate (UG)
student body and faculty at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) are the most diverse in the nation, but
inequities persist. Only 8.5% of PhD candidates in STEM-related programs at UHM are underrepresented (UR)
backgrounds. UHM has a rich pool of UR students who are not entering STEM-related PhD programs and
therefore are not contributing their cultural diversity to our nation's scientific workforce. Thus, the mission of
MARC@UHM is to provide training in biological research for a diverse group of UHM students, including
Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian, other Pacific Islanders (Samoan, Tongan, Micronesian, Guamanian/Chamorro, mixed
Pacific Islander), Filipino, Hispanic, African American; underrepresented Asians (e.g., Cambodian,
Vietnamese, Laotian); those from disadvantaged backgrounds, including low social-economic and residents of
rural outer islands; and students with apparent and non-apparent disabilities. MARC@UHM's objectives are to
i) enroll 10 students annually and teach them to identify important research questions, design and conduct
rigorous and reproducible experiments, and analyze data and interpret results, ii) provide each trainee with 4
semesters of mentored research and a summer research experience; iii) develop skills trainees need to be
competitive in graduate school and in careers as research professionals, and iv) assist each trainee in
applying to at least 5 graduate school programs early in the senior year. An estimated >900 UR STEM
students in biomedical research are eligible for the MARC@Hawaii Program. The Training Plan starts with
recruiting high school seniors entering UHM, especially those from the outer islands, to a Pre-MARC (The Ma
Mua MARC) Program as freshman and sophomores. The Ma Mua MARC encourages UR STEM majors to
consider research as a career option, invites them to attend MARC-seminars and functions, and creates a
community of peers. The 2-year program from juniors and seniors begins with a summer workshop, “Let's get
started” where trainees and research mentors are paired. The Plan includes: a 2-credit course each semester
designed specifically for MARC trainees, 4 semesters of mentored research, a summer research experience
(either at UHM or working with a collaborator of their UHM mentor at an external site), a short workshop,
attending a national meeting annually, and presenting their research at professional meetings. Over 25 UHM
faculty and 10 faculty at external sites with diverse backgrounds in ethnicity, age, gender, and rank will
participate. The primary outcome measure is the number of trainees graduating with BA/BS in 4-years who
transition to research-intensive Graduate Programs. Thus, MARC@UHM seeks to increase Hawaii's UR
citizens who transition to research careers, as they bring diverse cultural backgrounds, life experiences, ideas,
and interests to biomedical research."
10892828,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT (Project 2)
Clostridioides difficile disease recurrence is a serious problem because severity increases with each round of
infection and converts a regional enteric disease into a systemic fatal disease. We lack a good understanding
of the immune response to infection, which arguably is lacking or mis-directed, as evidenced by recurrent
infection. Serum IgG antibodies (Abs) that neutralize toxin B secreted by C. difficile (TcdB) is the best correlate
of protection. Ideally, infection would stimulate primary toxin-neutralizing Ab responses as well as induce toxin-
specific memory B cells (Bmem) that can respond rapidly to the pathogen and generate new Ab-secreting cells.
However, in mouse models and in analysis of human Bmem, infection results in a response which is dominated
by IgM+ cells, although some IgG+ and IgA+ cells are evident. Isolation and single cell barcoding of human TcdB-
specific Bmem followed by sequencing and repertoire analysis revealed that IgG+ and IgA+ cells had undergone
somatic hypermutation and had breadth of variable gene usage, representing several unique B cell clones.
Production of monoclonal Abs (mAbs) from selected IgG1 gene sequences revealed moderate affinity for TcdB
and poor TcdB neutralization in one in vitro assay. This work has guided us to a hypothesis that TcdB-specific
IgG and IgA encoded by the C. difficile-induced human B cell memory compartment have variable
capacity for toxin-neutralization. In Specific Aim 1 we will measure the impact of TcdB-specific Bmem-derived
mAbs on the mechanisms of host cell intoxication. We will produce mAbs from gene sequences in our database
and recruit new volunteers to expand the number of Bmem-repertoires. We will determine the impact of Bmem-
derived mAbs on the mechanisms controlling host cell intoxication and provide a comprehensive view of the
functions of human Bmem cell-encoded TcdB-specific Abs in individuals following C. difficile infection. In Specific
Aim 2: We will test the ability of Bmem cell-derived mAbs to protect against a live pathogen challenge and
determine mechanism of transport to the gut. We showed that the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) was required for
delivery of immunization-induced circulating IgG to the gut and protection against C. difficile, whereas
intraperitoneal delivery to recipient mice bypassed the FcRn requirement . We will deliver intraperitoneal mAb to
B6 mice to determine if human Bmem-derived mAbs are protective in vivo. We will use FcRn-/- mice expressing
the human FcRn and accessory molecule β2 microglobulin (hβ2M) transgenes (hFcRn:hβ2M ) to determine
hFcRn dependence for protection by circulating mAb. Aim 2 will provide critical data on whether Bmem-encoded
mAbs are protective in vivo and determine how they reach the gut. Project 2 has a high degree of relevance to
public health. Our current understanding of the humoral immune response to C. difficile in human subjects lacks
the necessary mechanistic insights to explain why patients are prone to recurrent infection. Our work will
determine if the Bmem compartment insufficiently encodes protective Abs and also reveal the functional
properties of protective versus non-protective Bmem cells and inform vaccination strategies."
10889929,"This MIRA application extends our decades-long research on nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and
how NMD factors can function in other aspects of cellular metabolism. NMD is a fundamental biological
process by which mammalian cells eliminate mRNAs containing a nonsense codon deriving from a genetic or
acquired frameshift or nonsense mutation. NMD also eliminates an estimated one-third of mRNAs that cells
produce by routine mistakes made during gene transcription and/or mRNA production. Over the years, we
have worked to elucidate the molecular mechanism of NMD. As one of many outcomes, we have established a
“rule” that clinicians and researchers use to predict which nonsense codons result in recessively inherited vs.
dominantly inherited disease. We have also demonstrated how cells regulate the efficiency of NMD as an
adaptive mechanism during changing environments, e.g. during development, differentiation, or drug
treatments. This application pursues our serendipitous finding that NMD is hyperactivated in fragile X
syndrome (FXS), which is the most common single-gene cause of intellectual disability and autism, affecting
1/4000 boys and 1/6000-8000 girls. We aim to understand how the protein that is missing in FXS functions via
interactions with other proteins and mRNAs to protect these mRNAs from translation and decay. We also aim
to decipher the mechanism by which the RNA-binding protein Staufen prevents a runaway immune response.
On another front, our long-time interest in mechanistic connections that span pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus
to mRNA translation and decay in the cytoplasm will be extended to include gene transcription and nuclear
mRNA decay. We have long been fascinated by the structural dynamics and functions of the largely nuclear
cap-binding heterodimer CBP80−CBP20, which binds co-transcriptionally to the 5'-cap of nascent pre-mRNAs.
While our past interests have focused on the role of CBP80−CBP20 in the pioneer round(s) of cytoplasmic
translation, during which we have shown exon-junction complex-mediated NMD occurs, we aim to understand
roles of CBP80−CBP20 in the nucleus. As one example, we are studying the mechanism by which a master
transcriptional co-activator of genes whose products regulate critical cellular processes engages with
CBP80−CBP20 so as to promote the expression of an understudied category of RNA polymerase III-
transcribed genes. In related work, we are studying connections between CBP80−CBP20 and the little-
understood, and so-called, nuclear cap-binding protein (NCBP)3. We aim to elucidate the significance of our
finding that NCBP3 regulates newly made mRNAs from genes encoding proteins that function in mitochondrial
biology. These connections will be examined in skeletal-muscle cells in vitro and ex vivo, the latter using mice,
which should lend insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of many human diseases that include sarcopenia,
neuromuscular disorders, and cardiomyopathies. While our interests are broad, they are connected by the goal
to understand molecular mechanisms in health and in disease, with a focus on RNA metabolism."
10897004,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Failure to replicate even a short stretch of DNA leads to chromosome missegregation and activation of error
prone DNA repair pathways. It is therefore crucial to ensure completion of DNA synthesis. However, the
completion of DNA synthesis is not under surveillance by cell cycle checkpoints. Additionally, while defects in
earlier stages of replication can be overcome by new initiation events, this is essentially impossible when short
stretches of unreplicated DNA remain. Thus, exquisitely effective DNA synthesis mechanisms are needed to
ensure the completion of DNA synthesis. The long-term goal of my lab is to elucidate and understand these
mechanisms. In the current proposal, we focus on the following mechanisms that normally support completion
of DNA synthesis, as well as mechanisms that restart DNA replication in response to DNA damage:
 (1) Replication termination occurs when two converging replication forks meet on the same stretch of
DNA and is how DNA synthesis is normally completed. We recently found that topological stress can cause
converging replication forks to stall and that this is overcome by both topoisomerase II-dependent and -
independent mechanisms. However, it is unclear why other topoisomerases cannot compensate for loss of
topoisomerase II and how these different mechanisms are efficiently engaged to ensure rapid fork convergence.
We will determine the roles that different topoisomerases play during DNA replication and how their respective
roles contribute to replication termination. We will also investigate how the different proteins that promote fork
convergence recognize their targets to ensure that obstacles to termination are efficiently overcome.
 (2) Replication fork reversal and Nascent Strand Degradation (NSD) are thought to allow replication forks
to bypass DNA lesions in an essentially error-free manner. However, it is unclear how exactly NSD contributes
to restart of reversed forks. We recently developed a new approach to induce efficient fork reversal and NSD
and identified new steps involved in this process. We will leverage our approach and insights to determine the
role that NSD plays in restart of reversed forks.
 (3) Break-Induced Replication (BIR) restarts DNA synthesis from a double-stranded DNA end. However,
it is unclear how BIR ultimately leads to completion of DNA synthesis and what the full set of required proteins
is. Additionally, Mitotic DNA Synthesis (MiDAS) is a BIR-like process that operates during mitosis but it is unclear
how the choice between MiDAS and BIR is determined. We have developed an approach to induce and monitor
BIR, which makes us uniquely equipped to address these questions. We will determine how BIR completes
synthesis and the proteins involved. We will also determine how the choice between BIR and MiDAS is
determined."
10905997,"This proposal focuses on dissecting of the molecular mechanisms involved in the
control of cell division, cell polarization, and morphogenesis. These simultaneously
interrelated and functionally distinct processes are controlled by small GTPases, switch
like proteins that primarily act at cell membranes to remodel cellular physiology. These

regulated. We propose to study the role of several small GTPases during these
processes in intact model organisms, including the nematode C. elegans and the fruit
ﬂy, Drosophila using a combination of live cell imaging, classical genetics, and
optogenetics. We will also dissect the mechanisms responsible for the spatial and
temporal activation of these GTPases which is critical for cell division, cell polarization,
and morphogenesis. Given the high degree of conservation of these processes,
information gained in this project could aid our understanding of certain cancers and the
origin of some birth defects."
10852000,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Microglia are long-lived central nervous system (CNS)-resident innate immune cells that have critical immune
surveillance functions and homeostatic functions in the brain including clearance of pathogens and maintaining
integrity of neuronal synapses. Microglia are targeted by HIV, have been proposed to be a reservoir for HIV
persistent infection and are mediators of HIV-associated inflammation and neuropathogenesis. Importantly,
microglia dysfunction is proposed to contribute to HIV associated neurodegeneration and inflammation even
when HIV replication is suppressed during antiretroviral treatments. The mechanisms, direct or indirect, that
drive microglia to promote inflammation during HIV infection have not been elucidated. In this study, we will
utilize a primary microglia-neuron coculture model derived from pluripotent stem cells to test the hypothesis
that HIV in microglia establishes persistently infected microglia that express aberrant viral RNAs, including
those that retain intronic sequences, which mediate inflammasome activation to drive microglia dysfunction,
CNS inflammation and neuronal injury. Our preliminary data supporting our hypothesis includes results
demonstrating that primary macrophages harbor defective HIV proviruses and, despite harboring deletions and
mutations that attenuate virus production, generate HIV RNAs. Furthermore, our previous work established the
potential role of HIV intron containing RNA in activating inflammatory activities in macrophages and microglia.
Specific questions addressed in this proposal include: 1) what is the status of proviruses in HIV infected
microglia; 2) what mechanisms drive persistent expression of HIV RNA in microglia; and 3) what are the
mechanisms that trigger inflammasome activation in HIV-activated macrophages? Completion of this project
will provide general insights into the impact of HIV-1 persistence and expression in the context of
microglia. Importantly, these studies will provide insights into mechanisms that contribute to HIV-1
CNS comorbidities which persist even with ART and could lead to new targets and strategies for
treatments that will improve the lives of people living with HIV."
10840287,"Project Summary
Bacteria are everywhere around us, playing critical roles in our health and global ecosystems. Understanding
how bacteria thrive is extremely important in keeping our bodies and environments safe and healthy. Bacteria
can dynamically adapt to a wide array of conditions by modifying their gene expression program, for example,
by boosting the production of proteins necessary for survival and limiting the wasteful production of others.
The ultimate goal of my research is to gain an enriched understanding of bacterial gene regulation, thus I study
the very fundamental question of how transcription, translation, and mRNA degradation are performed and
regulated in physiological settings. Due to the absence of a nucleus in bacterial cells, these three processes
occur in the same cytoplasmic volume without clear separations. Therefore, the cellular mechanisms enabling
their coordination inside a single cell offer an important foundation for understanding bacterial gene
expression programs. Here I describe projects in my group aiming to define the generalizable principles
underlying the spatiotemporal coordination of transcription, translation, and mRNA degradation in bacterial
cells. We plan to answer the following key questions: (1) What is the mechanism of transcription-translation
coupling? (2) How is the interaction between RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribosome dynamically regulated?
(3) How is the rate of mRNA degradation regulated by the age of mRNA and the subcellular localization of
RNase E, the major ribonuclease for mRNA degradation in Escherichia coli? We will answer these questions by
imaging the dynamics of RNAP, ribosome, and RNase E at the single-molecule level in live cells. Combining
these techniques with bacterial genetics, we will identify factors that can modulate the dynamics of RNAP-
ribosome interactions and analyze the subcellular heterogeneity in the localization and function of RNase E.
Collectively, our work will uncover new mechanistic principles of bacterial gene regulation and generate new
methods for measuring, controlling, and modeling gene expression dynamics at the single-molecule level in
live cells. The findings from our work have potential applications for a broad range of human health issues,
such as promoting healthy microbiomes, killing pathogens, and improving industrial processes to reduce
pollution."

days, demonstrated more than 40% higher preservation of C-peptide and nearly 1% lower HbA1c 2 years after
therapy in recent-onset T1D subjects. However, within successful T1D immunotherapy trials like low dose ATG,
there are clinical “responders” (those who produce significantly more C-peptide in response to therapy) and
“nonresponders.” The field of T1D lacks an ability to determine these clinical responders prior to clinical trial
enrollment and drug administration, thus exposing some individuals to ineffective interventions with considerable
side effect profiles. Utilizing samples from the NIH-funded TrialNet Low-dose ATG in Recent-Onset T1D clinical
trial (TN19), the objective of this proposal is to develop a response signature to ATG for use in future clinical trial
enrollment criteria and eventual clinical care. The objective that transcriptome, methylome and
immunophenotyping differences can identify a responder signature to ATG in T1D will be tested. Specifically,
Aim 1 will develop a biomarker of response using a unique in vitro model of ATG stimulation in TN19 baseline
clinical trial samples. The hypothesis being that innate and adaptive-specific genes will demonstrate differential
expression and methylation profiles with distinct immune phenotypes in clinical responders compared to
nonresponders following in vitro ATG stimulation. This is assessing the methodology of performing in vitro pre-
enrollment testing of a subject’s peripheral blood to determine their likelihood of response. Aim 2 will identify the
mechanisms of clinical efficacy through innovative single cell RNA sequencing, T cell receptor (TCR) α/β pairing,
TCR immunosequencing, and surface marker expression. In addition, the function of immune subpopulations
known to play a key role in immune tolerance (regulatory T cells and exhausted T cells) will add to the
mechanistic determination of ATG efficacy. This work may facilitate prospective personalized therapeutic
planning for individual patients or precision medicine-directed clinical trial enrollment criteria. These biomarkers
would improve responder rates and reduce exposure of nonresponders to side effects. My career goal of
developing predictive biomarkers for T1D immunotherapy clinical trials will be advanced by this proposal. Highly
valued skills set forth in the career development plan aim to promote further independence as an investigator
and include training in 1) immunological assays, 2) big data analytics, 3) responsible conduct of research, and
4) clinical trial design. The collaborative rapport and mission of training the next generation of investigators
across all institutes and departments of the University of Florida provide an ideal environment for career success."
10813768,"Two pulmonary interfaces play the key role in respiratory infections, both bacterial and viral (e.g.,
COVID19). The invaders enter via external interface formed by airway and alveolar epithelial cells.
The adjacent internal vascular interface formed by endothelial cells recruits and other host defense
including neutrophils (PMN) to invasion site. Overzealous PMN hurt endothelium. Emerging reports
implicate this collateral damage in COVID19 poor outcomes. Anti-inflammatory drugs could alleviate
this issue, but pose risk of infection spread. To protect lungs from ""friendly fire"" without inhibiting PMN
fighting infection we target nanocarriers loaded with anti-inflammatory agents using affinity ligands
binding to specific epitopes on the pulmonary endothelium. Fortuitously, pilot screening of ~30
nanoparticles revealed that after IV injection some formulations lacking affinity ligands accumulate in
the PMN in inflamed lungs. We want to use these findings for dual drug delivery to endothelium and
adjacent PMN. In Aim 1, we will interrogate the nano-scale interface between the surface of PMN-
tropic nanocarriers and microenvironment to elucidate the mechanism of PMN uptake. In Aim 2, we
will investigate effect of endothelial- and PMN-tropic nanocarriers on the micro-scale interface of
pulmonary microvasculature. These studies will elucidate the fundamental mechanisms by which
nanocarrier material properties dictate opsonization, and in turn tropism for PMNs, the most important
leukocyte in pneumonia. We will determine how nanocarriers localize to the two key cell types in
defense against pneumonia, thus creating a platform drug delivery system to treat both bacterial and
viral pneumonia."
10853014,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the proposed Emerging Global Leader Award is to support Dr. Martin Muddu’s research
training to develop as an independent implementation science investigator in HIV and hypertension. Dr. Muddu
is a research scientist at the Infectious Diseases Research Collaboration (IDRC) in Kampala, Uganda. He
proposes to conduct an implementation science study to integrate HTN screening and treatment into
community-based, patient-centered models of HIV care known as “differentiated service delivery.”
Accomplishing the proposed study in this application will facilitate his training goals to: 1) gain mastery of
mixed methods implementation science research; 2) acquire expertise in design and analysis of quasi-
experimental studies; and 3) develop skills in leadership, grant and manuscript writing, and mentoring of junior
investigators. This proposal builds on the skills he already has in HIV and hypertension clinical medicine and
methods of observational studies. He will leverage an interdisciplinary team of mentors and advisors with
expertise in his area of study to become a productive independent researcher. Hypertension affects nearly
one-third of Ugandan PLHIV, a large proportion of whom are undiagnosed and untreated. The World Health
Organization HEARTS package is an evidence-based strategy for HTN management, which we propose to
adapt, integrate, and implement into community HIV differentiated service delivery models using rigorous
implementation science methods. This will form the integrated hypertension-HIV differentiated service delivery
model. We will then evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the integrated hypertension-HIV
differentiated service delivery model regarding hypertension control in PLHIV. If implemented, this project will
generate evidence to inform guidelines for integration of HTN management into patient centered community
models of HIV care in Uganda and beyond."
10832552,"Core B: Airway Epithelial Cell Culture Core
Summary
The primary goal of Core B Airway Epithelial Cell Culture Core is to support the Seattle Center projects by
providing organotypic cultures of epithelial cells from carefully phenotyped individuals. The core is divided into
a pediatric sub-core and an adult sub-core. Core personnel will identify individuals scheduled for elective
surgery, explain the study, and obtain informed consent. Epithelial cells are collected from enrolled individuals
at the time of elective surgery by bronchial brushing via a secure endotracheal tube. Epithelial cells are
expanded in submerged culture and either stored or used immediately as needed for differentiated air-liquid
interface organotypic cultures to support the co-culture model systems in the two projects. A key function of the
Core is to carefully characterize individuals with asthma into T2-high and non-T2 clinical phenotypes, using
pre-defined criteria for children and adults. Both sub-cores will also collect epithelial cells from healthy controls
for comparisons. The pediatric sub-core will obtain additional longitudinal clinical data, allowing correlation of
specific clinical phenotypes and the associated epithelial endotypes with temporal clinical data. The adult sub-
core will also obtain airway cells via induced sputum, to assist in airway cell endotyping via determination of
the Type 2 Gene Mean (T2GM) and to provide airway cells for single cell RNA for sequencing. The adult sub-
core will also continue to expand a biorepository of adult airway epithelial cells obtained from donor lung
bronchial rings, which are discarded at the time of lung transplant. This provides significantly larger numbers of
cells per donor as compared to airway brushing. These cells will be provided along with assistance from the
core for mechanistic studies, using gene disruption techniques such as shRNA gene silencing or
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing."
10832550,"Core A: Administrative Core
Summary
The primary goal of the Administrative Core is to facilitate collaborations among the component institutions and
to support strong interactions with other AADCRC Centers. The Seattle Center grew out of existing
collaborations between translational and basic scientists who focus on the immune basis of asthma and related
immune disorders. The leadership of the component research programs share a focus on the airway
epithelium as a central orchestrator of the immune response in asthma. This Administrative Core is designed
to further facilitate collaborations among these existing programs and to utilize the strengths of each
component institution towards this common purpose. The major goals of the Core are to facilitate scientific
collaboration and productivity within the Seattle Center, facilitate interactions with other centers and the
development of junior investigators, and identify projects that merit support through the Infrastructure and
Opportunities Fund (IOF). We will further strengthen ties to other AADCRC programs to provide the
infrastructure to support acquisition of key samples that are necessary to discover the alterations in the
epithelium that are specific for asthma and the specific subtypes of this complex disease."
10817243,"Abstract/Summary
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure that is used to treat neurologic and
psychiatric disorders. Recent research in both animals and humans has shown that DBS may be
an effective procedure for refractory addiction. We previously propose to use DBS as treatment
for drug-seeking behaviors in a rat animal model, and found that high frequency DBS (HF-DBS)
of the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens (VS/NAc) impaired extinction of morphine-induced
conditioned place preference (CPP), whereas low frequency DBS (LF-DBS) enhanced extinction
memory (reducing drug seeking behavior). Interestingly, we also found that LF-DBS
significatively shortens the persistency of the drug (LF-DBS~10 days vs sham-DBS~40 days). At
the molecular level, we found that DBS-treated animals increased BDNF expression in the
hippocampus (HPC). However, drug reinstatement was not significatively prevented in LF-DBS-
treated animals when stimulation was applied only during extinction sessions. In this transition
between the SCORE-SuRE grant cycle, we propose to further advance the knowledge in drug-
seeking behavior, and in the underlying DBS’ mechanisms of action, by using pharmacological
and chemogenetic approaches. Therefore, in the present study, Aim 1a-c will determine whether
LF-DBS applied during extinction, in addition to provide electrical stimulation in the phase of
drug reinstatement prevents drug seeking in a higher percentage of animals. Also, BDNF
expression will be measured in the HPC, as well as in other brain regions, i.e., amygdala, VS/NAc,
and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Aim 2a will use a pharmacological approach by infusing
BDNF and TrkB antagonist (ANA-12) in the VS/NAc to determine their effects in extinction of
morphine CPP. Since glutamatergic neurons in the HPC encompass a subpopulation of neurons
expressing BDNF, the approach in Aim 2b is to use the chemogenetic tool, known as designer
receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to activate HPC glutamatergic
neurons in the presence of ANA-12, to prevent extinction of morphine CPP. Activation of
DREADDs will be done with clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Aim 2c will inactivate HPC-NAc
glutamatergic/BDNFergic projections that will prevent the beneficial effects of LF-DBS. Our
study represents a circuit-based approach to better understand the action mechanisms of drug-
seeking and extinction. Because rodent models of drug extinction resemble exposure-based
therapies in humans, it is possible that targeted electrical stimulation and the DBS-increased
expression of pro-extinction molecules might represent an effective future approach to reduce the
symptoms of addiction and opioid use disorders (OUD)."
10896909,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide and there remains a crucial need to
discover mechanisms of disease and develop new therapies. Leveraging the power of human genetics and
mechanistic discovery, we are poised to understand causal mechanisms of disease and design critical
therapies. Although there are more than 160 genetic loci discovered which are associated with CAD, outside of
lipid lowering therapies, the promise of these genome wide association studies (GWAS) to identify causal
genes and result in novel mechanisms for treatment has not been fulfilled.
 Recent discoveries have revealed that RNA editing is a fundamental mechanism of inflammation
and disease, a process mediated by ADAR enzymes. In a groundbreaking discovery now accepted in Nature,
the lab of the applicant’s co-mentor, Dr. Jin Billy Li, has discovered that common genetic variation which
decreases RNA editing powerfully increases CAD risk. Preliminary data implicates RNA editing in vascular
smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to have a causal role in CAD. In this proposal, the applicant aims to
elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of ADAR mediated RNA editing, and the potential for targeting the
pivotal downstream double stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor, MDA5 (encoded by IFIH1), as treatment in CAD.
 Vascular inflammation has long been implicated in the onset and progression of atherosclerosis, but the
specific disease modifying targets remain elusive. Pivotal studies have discovered that endogenous dsRNA is
formed in normal RNA transcription and undergoes RNA editing by ADAR1. If insufficiently edited, dsRNA will
activate a powerful interferon stimulated gene (ISG) response through MDA5 (IFIH1). Common genetic
variation can modify RNA editing frequency — ‘editing-QTLs’ (edQTL) — where edQTLs are not only predictive
of CAD risk, but also other autoinflammatory disorders including lupus and inflammatory bowel disorders.
 In this proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that the ADAR-MDA5 axis plays an important role in the onset
of CAD and that MDA5 is an ideal therapeutic target. However, there is a critical gap in knowledge, and it is
unknown if deficient RNA editing in SMCs accelerates the development of atherosclerosis, and it is imperative
that the ADAR-MDA5 axis is investigated to reveal its potential for therapeutic innovation.
 To address this, the applicant has bred a novel SMC lineage traced atherosclerosis mouse model with
conditional SMC deletion of Adar with and without Ifih1 deletion. Through a one-of-a-kind biobank of primary
HCASMCs, the applicant will further characterize the effect of MDA5 activation from decreased RNA editing.
Further, the applicant will discover the key genes downstream of MDA5 activation through a cutting-edge
genomics approach using epigenetic editing and single cell RNA sequencing (perturb-seq). This work will
advance the applicant’s training and enable the applicant to gain skill sets in bioinformatics, genetics, and
molecular biology — launching the applicant’s career as an independent physician-scientist."
10823338,"ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest and most aggressive cancer types, and
thus new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Pancreatic cancer cells are surrounded by a dense stroma
consisting of extracellular matrix and noncancerous cells, including fibroblasts and immune cells. Interactions
between tumor cells and the associated stroma are critical for tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Due
to the unusually low vascular density of PDAC, both the tumor and stromal cells experience hypoxia, a condition
of insufficient oxygen availability. To cope with hypoxic stress, both the tumor and stromal compartments
undergo adaptive changes primarily mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1ɑ and 2ɑ (HIF1ɑ and HIF2ɑ).
Although PDAC is known to be severely hypoxic and hypoxia predicts poor clinical outcome, the effects of
hypoxia and stromal HIF activation on tumor-stroma interactions in PDAC are not fully understood. Based on
our preliminary observation that inflammatory fibroblasts and macrophages are preferentially located in hypoxic
tumor regions whereas CD8+ T cells are largely excluded from hypoxic regions in PDAC, we hypothesize that
hypoxia drives an immunosuppressive microenvironment by promoting an inflammatory fibroblast phenotype
and in turn modulating infiltration and function of macrophages and CD8+ T cells. In Specific Aim 1, we will
determine how hypoxia and HIFs regulate an inflammatory fibroblast phenotype in PDAC using a three-
dimensional (3D) coculture system of pancreatic tumor cells and fibroblasts and exposing the coculture to either
hypoxia or normoxia, as well as using mouse models lacking fibroblast expression of HIF1ɑ or HIF2ɑ. In Specific
Aim 2, we will define how hypoxia-induced fibroblast-secreted factors and macrophage-intrinsic hypoxic
responses regulate macrophage recruitment and function in PDAC by treating macrophages with conditioned
media derived from 3D tumor cell-fibroblast cocultures under hypoxia, and using mouse models lacking myeloid
expression of HIF1ɑ or HIF2ɑ. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine how macrophages and fibroblasts contribute
to CD8+ T cell exclusion in hypoxic tumor niches by depleting macrophages or blocking a factor secreted from
fibroblasts in syngeneic orthotopic transplanted tumors, injecting a hypoxia probe into mice, and assessing CD8+
T cell infiltration and activation in hypoxic and normoxic tumor regions. Together, the proposed studies will
provide new knowledge on hypoxic regulation of the tumor-stroma crosstalk and inform the optimal design of
stroma-targeting therapeutic strategies for PDAC."
10823335,"Radiotherapy is an indispensable part of the standard care for glioblastoma (GBM) patients; however,
despite initial responses to radiotherapy, GBMs invariably recur. A proposed strategy for improving GBM
radiotherapy involves combining both radiotherapy and therapy targeting tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs). However, lack of an established mechanism by which TAM-targeted therapy improves GBM
radiotherapy has posed a barrier to clinical translation. Thus, there is an urgent need to establish mechanisms
by which TAM-targeted therapy alters radiotherapy. The main objective of this project is to determine the
cytotoxic mechanisms and anti-tumor efficacy of integrating TAM targeting within clinically relevant
radiotherapy regimens. For these studies, therapeutic targeting of TAMs will be accomplished by repurposing
the FDA-approved agent ferumoxytol. The main hypothesis is that ferumoxytol will reduce
immunosuppressive, tumor-promoting TAMs. This reduction in TAMs is expected to increase glioma cell
sensitivity to radiotherapy by both disrupting TAM-glioma cell heterotypic survival signaling and increasing
radiation-induced anti-tumor immune responses. This hypothesis will be evaluated using radiotherapy
regimens that are similar to clinical standards of care for two types of patients: those with newly diagnosed
GBM (Aim 1); and those with recurrent GBM (Aim 2). This will include completion of the following aims: Aim 1)
determine cytotoxic mechanisms and efficacy of combining ferumoxytol with conventionally fractionated
radiotherapy; and Aim 2) evaluate ferumoxytol’s ability to augment hypofractionated radiotherapy. Aim 1 will
evaluate the combination of ferumoxytol with radiotherapy in both in vitro coculture models and syngeneic
rodent models. Aim 2 will evaluate the combination of ferumoxytol and hypofractionated radiotherapy in a
translationally-relevant canine companion study. For both aims, the delivery and retention of ferumoxytol within
tumor regions will be verified non-invasively using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The investigators
believe the proposed research is innovative because it repurposes an established glioma imaging agent
(ferumoxytol), for theragnostic TAM targeting. If ferumoxytol does not prove as effective as expected for
enhancing radiotherapy, these studies will shift focus to other promising TAM-targeted therapeutics being
developed by the investigative team. Upon completion of the proposed studies, this project will have
established the therapeutic efficacy and cytotoxic mechanisms of combining TAM-targeted therapy with
radiotherapy. This contribution is expected to be significant for two reasons: it will provide knowledge
regarding the role of TAMs in modulating glioma cell resistance to radiotherapy; and it will lead to development
of more effective radiotherapeutic strategies. Given the prevalence of radiotherapy for treating cancer,
development of this therapeutic approach has the potential to improve outcomes for many patients."
10845520,"Project Summary
 Protein kinases are essential to cellular function and development, and constitutively activated kinases
have been widely targeted in the development of cancer therapies. Selectivity is a critical issue in kinase
therapeutic discovery and biomedical research, especially in regard to off-target effects. Since the ATP binding
site are highly conserved across the kinome, most ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors suffer from specificity
issues, and the development of specific kinase inhibitors remains a significant bottleneck in modern drug
discovery and biomedical research.
 Casein kinase 1 (CK1) is involved in various cellular signal transduction pathways including Wnt/β-
catenin, Hedgehog, and Hippo signaling pathways, and its mis-regulation results in various human diseases.
There are six CK1 isoforms in humans such as CK1α, CK1γ1, CK1γ2, CK1γ3, CK1δ, and CK1ε, and each
isoform displays individual physiological roles in cellular signal transduction. Currently, CK1 isoform-selective
inhibitors are rarely developed, and most of the known CK1-specific agents have been revealed as multi-target
or pan-kinase inhibitors upon further investigation. Thus, it will be a compelling future direction to develop
isoform selective inhibitors of CK1 for the investigation of specific signaling mechanism of CK1 isoforms in
pathophysiological conditions. The objective of this research is to develop isoform selective inhibitors of CK1
via computational analysis, synthetic chemistry, biochemical assays, and structural biology.
 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CK1 isoforms will be performed to identify distinct features in
the ATP-binding pocket of each enzyme for the design of selective inhibitors. In addition, the computational
techniques and analysis methods will be applied to explain the mechanisms responsible for selective inhibition
of each isoform. X-ray co-crystal structures of CK1 and our new specific inhibitors will be solved to assist
further design efforts and validate hypotheses generated by computational analysis and molecular modeling.
Multi-step synthesis and characterization of small molecules will be mainly conducted for the optimization of
the potency and specificity of our starting agents and designed compounds. ADP-Glo biochemical assays and
high-resolution Mass Spectrometry analysis will be used to study the inhibition of kinase activity of CK1
isoforms. A series of cell-based proliferation and functional assays will be performed to assess cellular potency
of selective inhibitors such as MTT or CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay and 4E-BP1- and LRP6-phosphorylation
analyses."

Despite advances in recent years, demographical data shows that underrepresented minorities
continue to lag behind their Caucasian contemporaries in various STEM disciplines, both in terms
of graduate degree completion and in terms of academic publications. Although the need for
diversity in STEM is heralded, the means by which to accomplish this objective remains unclear,
with initiatives implemented in graduate schools being too late to affect change.
This grant requests support for Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student
Enhancement (U-RISE) for Queens College (QC) at the City University of New York (CUNY). QC
is a public university situated within the single most ethnically diverse region in the country. In
servicing the borough of Queens, QC is a leader within the state and ranked fourth in the country
for social mobility. QC has held an NIH Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) that has
trained 116 students over 18 years in the biomedical sciences. Due to recent changes in QC's
eligibility for MARC granting, we aim to leverage the current momentum to implement a U-RISE
funding mechanism to support its existing training infrastructure for underrepresented
undergraduates in biomedical research programs. QC also supports a vibrant research
community of investigators with research programs funded by the NIH/ARO/NSF that span a
range of disciplines intersecting with biomedical sciences. In this grant, we have identified faculty
mentors dedicated to training undergraduates, a track record of advancing them to research-
intensive careers, and a sincere commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) values. This
effort is further supported by QC’s administration which intends to institutionalize undergraduate
training in biomedical research through curricular offerings (formalized courses), professional
development, ethics, and DEI workshops open to the broader QC undergraduate community.
This U-RISE grant will continue to support the legacy established through NIH MARC U-STAR
funding for community stakeholders by providing advanced research and professional
development training to U-RISE students, as well as enhancing the research environment at
Queens College as a whole, thereby affecting change for the many talented and diverse students
who entrust us with their career success."
10825530,"SUMMARY
This U-RISE grant proposal from the University of Detroit Mercy addresses the need for fostering
the development of underrepresented research scholars for careers in teaching and research in
the biomedical sciences. By increasing the diversity of underrepresented persons in positions of
leadership at research intensive institutions, the implicit biases that limit access to these positions
can be overcome. In addition, underrepresented persons with advanced degrees in research will
serve as role models for more junior trainees in the science pipeline who need peer mentors to
help visualize themselves at academic institutions with a career in biomedical research. This U-
RISE program (I-RISE with U-RISE: Preparing Underrepresented Scholars at Detroit Mercy for
Careers in Biomedical Research) will recruit, train, and mentor 60 underrepresented
undergraduates at the University of Detroit Mercy for three years (undergraduate years 2-4) per
student with a curriculum emphasizing scientific literacy, development, and research. Pre-URISE
and early U-RISE activities and courses will focus on establishing a sense of community, scientific
identity, and belonging as well as introducing trainees to their first hands-on laboratory
experiences with course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). Their scientific
identity will be further strengthened with additional courses/training modules in scientific writing,
responsible conduct of research (RCR), and scientific ethics. Subsequently, I-RISE with U-RISE
trainees will take additional CUREs as available, attend training workshops on analyzing and
interpreting Big Data and methods for enhancing reproducibility, participate in ongoing RCR
training, and engage in numerous career development sessions with their research mentors and
the Student Success Coordinator. These strategies will ensure the trainees have all the guidance
and resources they need to plan their path to graduate school and PhD training beyond the I-
RISE with U-RISE program. I-RISE with U-RISE trainees will spend two summers engaged in
intensive research experiences (~32 hours/week for 8-10 weeks) that will allow them to leverage
their extensive course-based laboratory skills into practice in research laboratories. The first
summer research experience will be internal to the University of Detroit Mercy, while the second
will be off-site at a research-intensive institution. The goal of this integrated research initiative
program is to prepare underrepresented trainees for a successful career as PhD scientists in
biomedical research and pave the way for the development of future researchers in the field."
10893322,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The health and life outcomes of individuals are intertwined with the context in which they grow and live. The
totality of exposures one experiences affects health in the short term and throughout the life course.
Environmental exposure to multiple contaminants can increase stress levels in individuals and neighborhoods
with psychosocial stressors such as crime, drug, and alcohol misuse, and violence also taking a toll on
individual and neighborhood wellbeing. In addition, the availability, organization, and quality of local
institutions and infrastructure all affect health in the short and long term.
Individuals are vulnerable to simultaneous exposure to an array of environmental and psychosocial stressors.
Exposure to environmental pollutants such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), perfluorooctane
sulfonic acid (PFOS), and perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFOA) are independently associated with
adverse health outcomes, but little is known about their combined effect on individual and neighborhood
stress, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and CVD mortality.
Exploring how diverse environmental pollutants combine to cause adverse health outcomes for individuals and
neighborhoods is critical for promoting healthier longer lives among populations in the United States.
Contextualized in the life course theory, our study seeks to close the gap in the literature on exposure to
multiple contaminants to understand the combined effect of Pb, Cd, Hg, PFOS, and PFOA on (a) allostatic load,
a measure of chronic individual stress, (b) Cumulative census track risk of psychosocial stress (CCRPS), a
measure of neighborhood stress, CVD risk and CVD mortality. We hypothesize that multiple environmental
exposures will increase individual and neighborhood level stress, CVD risk, CVD mortality.
It is critical to understand the extent to which the combined effect of Pb, Cd, Hg, PFOS, and PFOA affect the
outcomes in this study. Specifically, study results can be addressed through interventions for the most at risk to
limit combinations of exposures to these contaminants. Study findings will produce modified data analytical
techniques for modeling the combined effects of exposures while accounting for survey data design. In addition
to its implications on health, this project, we will attract and train students, especially those from historically
excluded student populations i.e., Black and Hispanic, to conduct research in environmental epidemiology and
data analytics. In sum, the proposed research project will enhance the current understanding of the impact of
multiple environmental pollutants on individual and neighborhood stress, CVD risk and mortality; this will
expand the research capacity at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, the nation’s largest
HBCU, which is perfectly aligned with the goals of the SuRE program."

10843806,"COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT & OUTREACH CORE PROJECT ABSTRACT
All Center projects will work with American Indian (AI) communities, and effective community engagement
will be essential to the success of the individual research projects and to the growth of the program. Based on
previous community input and priorities, we will investigate the impact of unresolved trauma and resilience on
AI health. The multi-disciplinary team will utilize a community-based, participatory research (CBPR) framework.
The PD/PI and the Community Engagement & Outreach Core (CEOC) Director are both tribal members from
the Dakotas, and they have extensive experience in AI community engagement, including the Indians Into
Medicine (INMED) Program. The INMED Tribal Advisory Board, active since 1973, will serve as the CEOC
Community Advisory Board. CEOC activities will be coordinated with other COBRE Cores and existing UND
IDeA community engagement programs to promote coordination and to avoid duplication of efforts.
Objectives
The long-term goal of the CEOC is to develop community-based research priorities that can be translated into
improved health outcomes. The research strategy will include tribal-specific Inventories of Tribal Research
Agendas to improve health status by linking research projects to community priorities. The CEOC's short-term
goal is to continue engaging communities and tribal partners through a CBPR framework.
1. Engage communities to identify research priorities.
2. Increase culturally-appropriate research with AI communities through bidirectional outreach and training.
3. Promote dialogue and disseminate findings from Indigenous Trauma & Resilience Research Center
 activities to tribal stakeholders.
Methods: An outreach and engagement plan will be developed through key informant interviews and focus
groups to promote COBRE activities in AI communities. The plan will include facilitating all aspects of culturally
appropriate and collaborative, community-engaged research. In addition to providing education and training to
tribal stakeholders regarding the value of and need for research, we will engage the research community by
providing training in culturally appropriate research and tribal community engagement. The process will include
using the rETHICS Toolkit on how to appropriately conduct research in tribal communities. A key component of
the CEOC will be to implement a communication plan that includes formal processes to facilitate community
engagement in interpretation of data and dissemination of findings from COBRE activities. We will also provide
summaries of previously conducted research to community stakeholders."

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality among American Indian populations, and
cardiovascular-related premature mortality among this population is worsening. Between 2000 and 2015,
cardiovascular disease mortality rates among American Indian individuals aged 25-49 years increased by up to
2.1%, yet declined or plateaued among similarly aged individuals in other racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. The
American Heart Association recently called for intergenerational examinations of consequences of chronic
stress, such as childhood adversity and trauma, on cardiovascular risk factors among infants and children.
American Indian populations have been exposed to historic trauma through violence, forced relocation and
forced acculturation. Additionally, American Indian populations are exposed to higher levels of Adverse
Childhood Experiences (ACEs) than other racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Infant growth is a
recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease in adulthood, yet the relationship between maternal adverse
childhood experiences and infant growth among American Indian populations is unexamined. Investigation of
the effect of chronic stress on maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and maternal and obstetric
outcomes is important, as these mechanisms may lie on the pathway between chronic stress and infant
growth. The Stress and Health in American Indian Pregnancies (SHAIP) study aligns with the goals of the
Indigenous Trauma and Resiliency Research Center by partnering with American Indian communities in
culturally relevant research. The SHAIP study will enroll 375 pregnant American Indian women from 3 tribal
communities in North Dakota, collecting detailed biologic, medical, and social data 1 time during pregnancy, at
birth, at 6 months postpartum and at 12 months postpartum. In Aim 1, we will assess the association between
maternal ACEs and maternal hair cortisol concentration during pregnancy. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis
that maternal hair cortisol concentration mediates the association between maternal ACEs and maternal and
obstetric outcomes. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will examine multiple mediators of the relationship between maternal
ACEs and infant growth. This proposed research project will allow me to examine, for the first time, potential
pathways between maternal ACEs and infant growth. Potentially modifiable mediators like breastfeeding and
maternal health may inform culturally informed interventions targeting American Indian populations in North
Dakota. Achieving the Specific Aims of this project will enable me to establish myself as a leading scholar in
the intergenerational transmission of maternal ACEs and cardiometabolic risk factors among infants."
10850947,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT: PROJECT SUMMARY
Part I: Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM): The Clinical Trials Office (CTO) at Virginia
Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC) comprises just over 100 employees who
provide centralized clinical research support services to MCC investigators. Services include comprehensive
regulatory support from protocol conception to activation, investigational new drug application support,
registration of new trials, and results reporting with ClinicalTrials.gov. The CTO also optimizes accrual and quality
data collection for externally peer-reviewed, investigator-initiated, National Clinical Trials Network, and industry-
sponsored studies by providing a centralized core of trained clinical research nurses, coordinators, and data
managers. Research coordination and protocol compliance is enhanced through fostering of investigator-patient-
CTO interaction, collaboration, and teamwork. The CTO actively assesses protocol and regulatory compliance
and monitors data accuracy and timeliness. As the central data repository of all oncology, human subjects-
related research studies at VCU, the CTO provides comprehensive reports and performance metrics to the
MCC leadership for proper oversight, strategic planning, and performance improvement. The CTO is
instrumental in the development and delivery of training and education initiatives for both clinical research staff
and investigators. In 2021, the CTO reported recruitment of 1,288 individuals into all clinical or community-based
research studies being conducted under the MCC (473 interventional and 815 non-interventional accruals) and
facilitated the activation of 62 new studies, including 22 institutional and externally peer-reviewed studies.
Part II: Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM): DSM is required for all interventional studies within the MCC. For
investigator-initiated trials, the MCC has established its own DSM Committee (DSMC), which performs risk-
based monitoring to ensure the highest levels of patient safety. Effective quality control functions are also
instituted to ensure the highest level of protocol compliance according to the MCC’s NCI-approved DSM Plan.
In 2021, the DSMC actively monitored 23 studies.
Part III: Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Across the Lifespan in Clinical Research: The MCC maintains
and supports multiple, proactive efforts to promote the recruitment of women and minorities into research. In
2021, among the 473 interventional accruals, 56% were women, and 43% represented ethnic and/or racial
minorities. The MCC supports the NIH policy on the inclusion of individuals across the lifespan in research. In
2021, 25 children were enrolled onto interventional studies, 258 participants between the ages of 18-64, and 131
participants 65 or older were enrolled onto interventional studies."
10850951,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM: PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) is to provide independent peer review of the
scientific merit, priority, feasibility, and progress of all clinical cancer research studies conducted within the
Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC). PRMS functions are accomplished by
rigorous evaluations through a multi-stage review process conducted by 1) MCC’s multidisciplinary Disease
Working Groups (DWGs) that perform initial assessments of the value, fit, operational feasibility, and prioritization
within the existing portfolio of studies; and 2) the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC), the
definitive, independent authority for determining which studies proceed to activation based on scientific merit.
DWG approval is required before proceeding to the PRMC; however, only the PRMC has final authority with
regards to determining which studies will be activated. The PRMS process ensures that all MCC cancer-relevant
research studies are 1) scientifically sound; 2) effectively designed, specifically from a biostatistics perspective;
3) appropriately prioritized within the DWG research portfolio to avoid competing trials and ensure alignment with
MCC’s overall institutional priorities for clinical research; 4) feasible for activation and completion (or in meeting
institutional target accrual goals); 5) assessed for data and safety monitoring adequacy based on the study risk
level; and 6) monitored regularly for accrual and scientific progress. In 2021, the MCC DWGs vetted in aggregate
113 studies and forwarded 77 to the PRMC. Once received by the PRMC, 42 studies received an initial expedited
review by the PRMC as they had already received an appropriate external scientific peer review, and 35 studies,
primarily representing MCC’s investigator-initiated and industry-sponsored trials, were forwarded for full PRMC
review. More than 20% (7/35) of the studies reviewed by the full committee required modifications prior to
approval. None of the studies were disapproved, reflecting the effectiveness of the DWG vetting process and
the attentive support investigators receive from the MCC Clinical Trials Office and MCC leadership in developing
their investigator-initiated studies prior to PRMC submission. In addition, in CY2021 the PRMC performed
scientific and accrual monitoring reviews for 152 studies. Of those, 59 studies received low accrual notifications
requiring Principal Investigator response. This resulted in the closure of 14 studies. The PRMS, inclusive of the
DWG and PRMC review processes, is one of the most critical functions that the MCC performs to ensure the
highest quality clinical research is being conducted."

10818575,"Abstract: DNA damage arises spontaneously from endogenous and exogenous sources and multiple DNA
repair pathways are required to identify and repair sites of damage. Failure to repair damage can result in cell
death or mutations. Somatic mutations accumulate as we age and result in a wide spectrum of diseases
including cancer. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which DNA repair enzymes
function and identify the key biophysical and biochemical principles that are important for successful DNA
repair. A fundamental understanding of DNA repair enzymes is immensely valuable as it provides a framework
for understanding the relationships between genotype and phenotype, exposure-induced mutagenesis risks,
and in rationally improving treatments that directly or indirectly cause genotoxic stress, such as cancer therapy.
This proposal will focus on repair of the most abundant forms of DNA damage both because of the clear
biological importance, and because these are excellent model DNA repair systems to elucidate basic principles
that may be applied broadly to understanding many DNA repair pathways. We will primarily focus on human
enzymes because of the opportunities to immediately translate experimental findings in the context of specific
diseases and treatments. We take an interdisciplinary approach to combine different types of structural and
biophysical information and to integrate information across multiple time and size scales. This work builds upon
our core strength in transient kinetics with rigorous structure/activity analysis. Although the focus of this project
is in uncovering the fundamental biological mechanisms for DNA repair, we will combine forces with a diverse
set of collaborators who bring unique perspective and training that will allow us to pursue translational and
clinical aspects of DNA repair that pertain to specific disease contexts."
10831007,"Project Summary. General anesthesia, the reversible pharmacologic inhibition of neural functions underlying
consciousness, awareness, memory, and nociceptive motor responses, is an essential medical intervention.
There is a clear need for new anesthetic drugs with predictable kinetics and reduced toxicity, which will
facilitate medical procedural innovation, efficacy, efficiency, and accessibility. I have contributed to these goals
using two rigorous and complementary strategies. First, I have rigorously advanced basic science knowledge
of molecular anesthetic mechanisms in established targets such as GABAA receptors. This research has
revealed unexpectedly specific interactions between different general anesthetic chemotypes (etomidate
derivatives, methyl-phenyl allyl barbiturates or MPABs, neurosteroids like alphaxalone, and benzoyl alcohols)
and distinct sets of transmembrane inter-subunit sites in typical synaptic GABAA receptors. I also introduced
Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) two-state co-agonist models for quantitative analysis of anesthetic effects in
these receptors. Second, recognizing that GABAA receptor-specific drugs have proven unsatisfactory as sole
clinical general anesthetic agents, I am among the first to adopt zebrafish as an unbiased pharmacodynamic
model to discover new hypnotic chemotypes that may act via multiple molecular targets, and to develop
transgenic lines to accelerate mechanisms research. The broad long-term objectives of this R35 (MIRA)
grant during the next five years and beyond are to further advance our understanding of anesthetic
mechanisms at the molecular level, to discover new chemical families with sedative-hypnotic activity,
and to create new transgenic zebrafish to test the roles of specific drug-receptor interactions in
anesthetic effects. Molecular knowledge areas that will be addressed by this project include, but are not
limited to improving the precision of anesthetic site mapping in GABAA receptors, developing MWC models that
account for differential agonist versus GABA modulation effects of the distinct site-selective anesthetic
chemotypes, probing the subunit arrangement and structures of other important (e.g. extra-synaptic) GABAA
receptor isotypes using subsite-specific anesthetics and mutations that selectively affect their actions, and
extending these structure-function approaches to other anesthetic-sensitive pentameric ligand-gated ion
channels. I will also apply the platform combining zebrafish larvae and real-time video analysis of up to 96
animals at a time to identify new sedative-hypnotic chemotypes in drug libraries and assess a variety of
sedative-hypnotic drug interactions. New hypnotic chemotypes will be characterized for effects in a panel of
molecular anesthetic targets using electrophysiology and pharmacologic tools. I will also develop new
transgenic zebrafish lines with knock-out or knock-in mutations in anesthetic target proteins as models for
testing if these targets mediate the behavioral effects of established or discovered sedative-hypnotics."
10800671,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human mobility underlies infectious disease transmission and determines the spatial-temporal dynamics of
outbreaks and endemic disease dynamics. Yet, we do not understand how best to incorporate individual or
population mobility patterns into models of infectious diseases. Human travel has been successfully incorporated
into models used for planning, surveillance, and reactive responses to influenza pandemics, the COVID-19
pandemic, malaria, and others. However, little validation or comparison of approaches used in these models has
been performed. Further, there has been no systematic investigation of the extent to which the many different
existing sources of human travel data quantify travel patterns, or which descriptions of human mobility are most
relevant to disease processes. The small amount of human mobility data available globally requires
generalization or extrapolation of features of one dataset to another setting, time or circumstance. This
generalization may work for some features of pathogens for a subset of pathogens or transmission routes but
may fail miserably in others. It is unlikely that all travel patterns are relevant for all types of diseases. The life
history of each pathogen, transmission routes, age structure of incidence and outbreak context will all dictate the
importance of specific types of movement. For mobility data to be useful in planning for outbreaks and monitoring
interventions, transmission models utilizing mobility data and models must be confronted with epidemiological
data (including contact tracing, traditional surveillance, and genetic data) from a variety of sources. Here, we
propose to perform the first systematic analysis of existing mobility data and models to identify which models
perform best under multiple assumptions using a range of simulations and data from historic outbreaks. We will
also identify circumstances when generalized models or non-local data are misleading. To do this, we will collate
and standardize a large number of mobility datasets collected by various methods. We will statistically
characterize these datasets to identify sources of variation in human mobility at individual, household,
community, and larger scales. We will develop multiple candidate models describing mobility and incorporate
these candidate models into a range of commonly used models of infectious disease transmission. Proceeding
with the principle that human mobility is only useful to models of infectious diseases if it improves our ability to
recapitulate the dynamics of observed outbreaks, we will test the ability of each of these candidate mobility
models to explain observed patterns of contacts and sequenced pathogens observed in outbreaks of dengue,
Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19. In doing this, we will identify conditions under which human mobility can improve
our understanding of the transmission and pathogens, inform response strategies and create a resource that
can inform responses to multiple current and future outbreaks."
10818354,"Stroke remains a major cause of death and disability in the U.S. Identifying modifiable risk factors to develop
effective prevention is the best strategy for reducing the burden of this disease. Racial and geographic
variations in stroke mortality has been observed in the U.S. for decades. However, the reasons for these
variations are still unclear. The impact of radon exposure in relation to human health has been increasingly
recognized. Radon is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas, formed through the radioactive decay of radium-
226, which enters homes, and other buildings, through cracks and penetrations in the building substructure.
Radon has been classified as a human lung carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer
since 1988. Recently, some studies conducted in countries outside the U.S. have linked radon, even at low
levels of exposure, to the risk of stroke. In the U.S., county-level radon exposure has been associated with
elevated mortality from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The overarching goal of this project is to
examine the association between radon exposure and stroke risk and to investigate whether geographic
variation of radon concentration is related to the distribution of stroke rate in the U.S. Specifically, we will
examine radon exposure at both county- and household-level in relation to the risk of ischemic stroke. In
addition, we will explore the underlying mechanisms by linking radon exposure to blood pressure,
hypertension, lipid profile, and hemostatic and inflammatory biomarkers. Radon exposure is rising steadily
within the modern North American residential environment. The proposed study will be the first to assess radon
exposure and stroke risk in the U.S. general population, including both male and female African Americans and
Caucasians. Since randomized clinical trial on radon exposure is not feasible, findings from this project will
provide insights into the racial and geographic variations of stroke rate in the U.S. and possibly identify a
potential modifiable risk factor for stroke."
10828719,"Long-term effects of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) on the CNS vary with exposure dose, duration, and
timing. Despite decades of research, we still lack efficient means of detecting and therapeutically targeting the
damage. However, progress may have been limited by our failure to attend to the full spectrum of brain pathology
linked to neurobehavioral dysfunction. For example, besides neurons, alcohol exposures across the lifespan, but
especially during development, exert toxic/metabolic effects that impact the integrity of white matter (WM) myelin,
axons, and oligodendrocytes (OLs), yet the mechanisms are poorly understood. Dysfunction or loss of OLs
compromises the structure and function of myelin, impairing axonal conductivity. Preliminary studies showed that
developmental exposures to ethanol reduce the expression of mature myelin-associated genes and proteins, in
part due to impaired maturation of oligoprogenitor cells and/or survival of mature OLs. Attendant hypomyelination
and dysmyelination render WM axons vulnerable to toxic/metabolic injury and degeneration with loss of synaptic
connections. This competing renewal R37 application builds on our previous gains that mechanistically linked
ethanol-impaired insulin and IGF-1 signaling through PI3K-Akt and downstream pathways to deficits in neuronal
survival and migration during development. Another critical success of those experiments was that they revealed
how ethanol inhibition of aspartyl-asparaginyl-β-hydroxylase (ASPH) and Notch impair survival, maturation and
migration of immature CNS neurons. However, empirical observations and subsequent preliminary studies led to
the hypothesis that WM OLs may be similarly impaired by ethanol via disruption of Akt-mTOR-mTORC1/2 which
alters the composition and integrity of WM myelin. We now propose to extend these gains by determining how
ethanol inhibits insulin/IGF-Akt-mTOR-mTORC1/2 signaling and reduces ASPH-Notch activation in relation to
WM structure and function during postnatal and adolescent development. Aim 1 will delineate mechanisms of
long term FASD WM and OL pathologies by examining developmental stage-associated impairments in signaling
through insulin/IGF-1-PI3K-Akt-mTOR-mTORC1/2, and ASPH-Notch activation. Aim 2 will assess FASD dose-
dependent inhibition of sulfatide (ST) in relation to impairments in OL maturation; in many CNS diseases, ST
depletion in WM mediates cognitive-motor deficits. Aim 3 stems from preliminary studies showing that ethanol’s
effects on WM sphingolipid profiles, including STs, are detectable in peripheral blood circulating extracellular
vesicles (EVs). Therefore, we propose to examine the utility of MALDI Mass Spectrometry (MS) EV assays for
non-invasive detection of WM pathology and responses to treatments that restore ASPH-Notch pathways needed
for OL/WM maturation and function. Our hypotheses will be addressed with in vivo, slice culture, and isolated OL
models, quantitative immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, multiplex ELISAs, mRNA analyses, and
MALDI-MS. The research is novel, mechanistic, robust, transparent, and inclusive of dose effects and both sexes.
The prospects for extending this research to humans via non-invasive MALDI EV assays are extremely high."
10867295,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Deciphering mechanisms that control lineage-specific gene transcription during hematopoiesis is critical for
identifying fundamental principles of cellular differentiation and new therapies for blood disorders. Enhancers
are noncoding cis-acting DNA sequences that control cell fate by directing spatiotemporal gene expression.
Despite the increasing availability of genome-wide profiles of putative enhancers, it remains difficult to
elucidate the molecular processes controlling enhancer function during lineage differentiation, highlighting a
major impediment for understanding the major determinants of normal and pathological hematopoiesis. The
challenges we are now facing are to characterize the regulatory components of lineage-defining enhancers in
physiologically relevant contexts and to interrogate their in vivo function during lineage specification.
Addressing these challenges requires a shift from enhancer mapping studies to detailed characterization of
their molecular composition in native chromatin during cellular differentiation. The objectives of this project are
to determine the protein and RNA complexes controlling enhancer activation in situ, and to establish the in vivo
function of lineage-specifying enhancers during erythroid cell differentiation and hematopoiesis. The central
hypothesis is that enhancers are assembled by combinations of tissue-specific transcription factors, chromatin
regulators, and RNA complexes to direct long-range chromatin interactions for lineage-specific gene
transcription. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of the substantial progresses made during the
prior funding period of this project, including the development of CRISPR/dCas9-based affinity capture of
locus-specific chromatin interactions and enhancer-targeting epigenetic perturbation systems for in vivo
interrogation of enhancer function. Using these approaches, we uncovered the organizational principles
controlling erythroid lineage-specific super-enhancers and established new molecular links between
hierarchical organization of 3D chromatin structures and in vivo enhancer function. Guided by these
preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims: 1) Determine enhancer-regulating
chromatin complexes during cellular differentiation by dCas9-based proximity labeling. 2) Identify and
characterize chromatin-associated RNAs that control enhancer structure and function. 3) Elucidate the in vivo
function of “hub” enhancers in hematopoiesis by single-cell CRISPR epigenetic perturbation. Together these
studies will not only elucidate mechanisms for the transcriptional control of principal determinants of cellular
differentiation, but also establish new tools for the analysis of enhancer structure-function in situ and in vivo.
Such results are expected to advance our mechanistic understanding of the causal relationships between
enhancer composition and in vivo function during hematopoiesis. Ultimately, these findings will facilitate the
development of innovative approaches to modulate enhancer activity through genetic or pharmacological
manipulations, resulting in mechanism-based therapies for hematologic disorders."

While the evidence base has grown for interventions for autistic youth, few of these interventions are being
implemented in public schools, the primary setting in which autistic children receive intervention, due to
misalignment of existing implementation strategies with that setting. There is a need for contextually appropriate
implementation strategies to be used to support lay providers in learning and using these interventions. This
three-year project will apply the local Discover, Design, Build, and Test (DDBT) framework to redesign and then
pilot a multifaceted implementation strategy to support paraeducator use of a behavioral skills evidence-based
intervention, RUBI for Educational Settings (RUBIES), for autistic children in public schools. The proposed study
aims to: 1) identify targets for redesign from implementation strategies currently used to support RUBI clinician
implementation to maximize paraeducators’ RUBIES use in schools; 2) iteratively adapt the existing RUBI
implementation strategies; and 3) test the newly-redesigned RUBI in Educational Settings (RUBIES)
implementation strategy compared to the unadapted RUBI implementation strategy on DDBT mechanisms
(engagement, usability, appropriateness), proximal implementation outcomes (adoption, fidelity, adaptation,
reach), and child behaviors (disruptive behavior, functioning, top problems) with 40 paraeducators supporting 80
elementary-school autistic children. Successful completion of the proposed study will result in a refined set of
implementation strategies to support RUBIES use among lay providers in public schools and has the strong
potential to inform how evidence-based practices can be implemented in schools more broadly. Knowledge
gleaned from this study has the potential to improve the quality of life for autistic children served in public schools
across the country."

Replacement of insulin-producing cells through islet transplantation in patients with type-1 diabetes (T1D) has
proven to be an effective therapy, resulting in improved metabolic control and quality of life, and in prevention of
long-term T1D complications. To obtain inexhaustible sources of insulin-producing cells, extensive efforts have
been directed towards generating functional β cells or islet-like clusters (ILCs) from human induced pluripotent
stem cells (hIPSC). However, a major barrier in generating ILCs is the considerably low yield of the stem cell
differentiation process and the inability to obtain and maintain mature β cells in long-term culture. These current
shortcomings in traditional culture systems motivate the development of an innovative bioengineered
physiomimetic pancreatic niche. To engineer a physiologically relevant microenvironment for long-term culture
of functional ILCs, we have developed an innovative approach combining three critical components: 1) the use
of a through-pore microwell array to produce homogenously sized ILCs and prevent their agglomeration, 2) the
incorporation of gravitational flow-based perfusion (direct/perpendicular medium flow through ILCs) to allow for
removal of debris, continuous medium exchange, and provide mechanical cues, and 3) the inclusion of human
pancreatic decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) to ILC to provide more physiologically relevant biochemical
cues. We propose to develop and test an open, long-term culture system for ILCs that provides robust control
on the spatial, biophysical and biochemical culture microenvironment and allows for acquisition of multiple
functional ILC readouts that will help optimizing those critical factors that promote the maturation and functionality
of ILCs from hIPSC-derived endocrine progenitor (EN) cells. A single platform for manufacturing ILCs that
incorporates these three technologies to promote differentiation, maturation, maintenance and testing of ILCs is
not available. Here, we will conduct proof of concept experiments that will advance the field of islet biology and
will validate an innovative platform to produce ILCs for beta cell replacement therapy in T1D. We envision that
our platform can also be adopted for the long-term culture of human islets and for promoting maturation of
neonatal porcine islets."

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Diabetic complications manifest themselves differently between men and women. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of these sex-related differences is critical to designing tailored therapeutic approaches. This proposal is focused on sex differences in the progression of DKD with specific emphasis on the contribution of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in diabetic females and males.  To explore the sexual dimorphisms in the development of DKD, we propose to use here non-obese type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN) rats. We have demonstrated previously that T2DN rats develop renal and physiological abnormalities similar to clinical observations in humans with DKD, implying these rats are an excellent model for studying the progression of renal injury in type 2 DKD.  Furthermore, our recent studies revealed sexual dimorphism in this model, indicating that while both female and male T2DN rats developed non-obese DKD phenotype, females had significant protection from the development of severe forms of glomerular and tubular damage. The main goals of this project are to determine potential molecular mechanisms causing renal, and specifically glomerular, injury and evaluate sexual dimorphism of these pathways in type 2 DKD.  Aim 1 will explore the functional and structural differences between male and female T2DN rats and further identify critical sex dependent pathways in DKD.  Furthermore, our pilot studies have revealed that the cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) / STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING) signaling pathway is upregulated in male T2DN rats and can contribute to the observed sex difference.  The role of the cGAS-STING pathway in multiple regulatory mechanisms, specifically in cancer and inflammatory diseases, was recently reported. Since then, the development of drugs targeting the cGAS-STING pathway has been within the major interests of pharmaceutical companies, which provides high translational potential due to the possibility of repurposing already approved drugs.  The potential role of the STING pathway in renal inflammation and fibrosis was also uncovered. Furthermore, it was proposed that the cGAS-STING pathway plays a key role in podocytopathy and modulating DKD. However, the contribution of this pathway towards the development of DKD and its role in observed differences in female and male diabetic subjects have not been established.  Based on our pilot studies, we hypothesize that the cGAS-STING pathway contributes to the progression of DKD and sexual dimorphism, which will be explored in Aim 2.  A combination of in vivo and ex vivo studies will be used to address the following Specific Aims: 1) To characterize the sexual dimorphisms in the progression of type 2 DKD; and 2) To define the contribution of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in the progression of DKD and its contribution to sex difference."

Although Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) is widely used to examine brain
activation in adults, technical and logistical challenges frequently limit the ability to perform fMRI scans readily
and longitudinally in infants, particularly in those at greatest risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes and
developmental delays. As a consequence, prognostics are made on general basis and cannot be individualized
for optimal management. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy – Diffuse Optical Tomography (fNIRS-DOT)
imaging promises to be an alternative imaging technique. The current fNIRS-DOT imaging are limited to cortex
regions and unable to interrogate deep structures such as the basal ganglia and thalamus that are often involved
premature infant brain injury. Recently, we reported a continuous wave-based transcranial near infrared optical
imaging system, called Cap-based Transcranial Optical Tomography (CTOT) that employed a single, GaAs
intensified, CCD detector array to image whole brain hemodynamic activity in an awake child with seconds of
acquisition time. However, the substantial readout time of the CCD detector and slow mechanical switching of
source and detector fiber optics resulted in large dead-times that lengthened measurement times. Armed with
our preliminary data of the clinical feasibility, we propose to speed up measurement times by adapting recent
advances of fast read-out, scientific CMOS detector arrays along with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
for novel dynamic range control, automated calibration, and optical switching of source and collection fiber optics
in order to enable sub-second, dynamic CTOT mapping. The significance and innovation of this approach will
be substantial, as never before has a nonintrusive, noninvasive methodology been developed to completely
elucidate whole brain hemodynamic activity in infants. Our specific aims are to: (1) refine our CTOT imaging
system with a single, GaAs intensified integrating detector, a MEMS optical switch for source fiber optics and a
digital micromirror device for detector fiber optics to enable rapid, dynamic imaging; and (2) validate CTOTfNIRS
derived hemodynamic activity in infants undergoing BOLD fMRI. If successful, the proposed work will provide
the first, rapid whole brain CTOT imaging system for sensitive assessment of brain hemodynamic activity in
infants. In the short term, CTOT images will eventually help parents, physicians and therapists best plan and
care for children with brain deficits so that their quality of life is optimized as they progress through childhood."

The goal of this proposal is to understand how glial cell pathophysiology contributes to disease progression in
glaucoma, a neurodegenerative eye disease characterized by dysfunction and death of retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs), the output neurons of the retina. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most common risk factor for
glaucoma, yet the mechanisms linking high IOP and RGC loss remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on an
important but previously unexamined aspect of disease progression: how early structural remodeling of Müller
glial cells contributes to degeneration of RGCs. In glaucoma, as in other retinal diseases, Müller cells undergo a
variety of molecular and morphological changes referred to as reactive gliosis. However, little is known regarding
how Müller cells respond to ocular hypertension early in disease or how gliosis leads to RGC degeneration. We
will use a combination of optical imaging, transgenic mice, viral techniques, and patch-clamp electrophysiology
in an ex vivo eyecup preparation to fill these gaps in our knowledge. Aberrant Ca2+ signaling during disease
onset may be an important upstream event that occurs prior to overt signs of Müller cell gliosis. In Aim 1A, we
will test the hypothesis, suggested by our preliminary findings, that elevated pressure induces excessive Ca2+
signaling in Müller cell peri-synaptic processes within the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina. We will use
two-photon (2P) microscopy to compare Ca2+ signals in Müller glia in eyes with normal pressure vs. eyes in
which IOP has been chronically elevated in a microbead occlusion model of glaucoma. In Aim 1B, we will directly
test whether changes in Ca2+ signaling can drive morphological changes in Müller cells by selectively
manipulating Müller cell intracellular [Ca2+]. Experiments in Aim 2A will use the microbead occlusion model and
2P imaging of fluorescently labeled Müller glia and RGCs to investigate whether ocular hypertension alters the
physical relationship between Müller glial fine processes and RGC dendrites. In our preliminary work examining
the morphology of Müller cells in tissue from eyes with chronically elevated IOP, we found that Müller cell
processes retract within specific sublayers of the IPL. We will test the hypothesis, suggested by these preliminary
findings, that Müller cell processes selectively withdraw from certain RGC subtypes soon after onset of ocular
hypertension. An important function of Müller cell peri-synaptic processes is to regulate extracellular glutamate
near synapses. Withdrawal of Müller glia could contribute importantly to disease progression by promoting RGC
death via excitotoxic damage. Experiments in Aim 2B will examine this possibility by using two-photon Ca2+
imaging to test the hypothesis that elevated IOP increases light-evoked N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate
receptor activity in the dendrites of specific RGC subtypes. In both Aims, we will focus specifically on early-stage
disease by conducting experiments within the first 1-2 weeks after IOP elevation. By identifying
pathophysiological changes in Müller cells that occur early in disease progression, this work will help reveal
novel ways to diagnose and treat glaucoma before RGC degeneration leads to irreversible vision loss."
10844583,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell therapies are living drugs that can access a multifaceted biological response and can
therefore potentially provide not only therapeutic but also regenerative outcomes. However, these
beneficial attributes of cell therapeutics are accompanied by significantly more complex, variable,
and costly production logistics. Major advances in biomanufacturing are required for cell therapies
to have broad and widespread use. In this application, we propose to develop aptamer-based
technologies for cell separation that will provide an impactful improvement over current
technology, resulting in superior product at a fraction of the cost. Our main objectives are to 1)
establish a novel SELEX method for membrane proteins and identify new aptamers for cell
isolation applications, 2) develop methods for traceless isolation of monocytes and generation of
macrophage and dendritic cell products for immunotherapy, 3) demonstrate multiplexed selection
and T cell subset selection for CAR T cell immunotherapy applications, and 4) enable efficient
collection and expansion of urine stem cells as a source for regenerative medicine therapies.
Successful completion of these aims will lead to a platform technology for scalable and more
affordable production of CAR T cell immunotherapy, monocyte-based cell therapies and stem cell
treatments."

We will develop a new spatial-omics platform, Light-Seq, for spatial indexing of intact biological samples using
light-directed DNA barcoding in fixed cells and tissues followed by ex situ sequencing. Our light-directed
barcoding strategy will enable user-directed, in situ selection of rare, disjoint cell populations for full-
transcriptome sequencing based on morphology, location, or protein expression without dissociation. We will
develop Light-Seq as a spatial-omic DNA barcoding platform capable of extracting the transcriptomic information
from single-cells, scalable to uniquely address thousands of user-defined regions, and can be applied in both
fixed and FFPE clinical samples for direct applications in human health. We envision that the Light-Seq platform
will be a scalable, cost-effective, and flexible approach to spatial transcriptomics that allows the user to define
spatial regions in tissue for NGS sequencing. Light-seq can thus serve as a low barrier-to-entry platform for
spatial transcriptomics for many pathologists and researchers, and would be a key driver for a wider adoption of
spatial transcriptomic tools."

10898585,"PROJECT 1: PROJECT SUMMARY
 Glioblastoma remains resilient to therapy and recurrence is almost universal. In particular, targeted
therapies fail given the heterogeneity in the expression or presence of molecular targets for these therapies
across tumors. Oncolytic virotherapy (OV) is an anti-tumoral strategy where viruses selectively replicate and
kill tumor cells in the brain and potentially, activate anti-tumoral immune response. Initial studies showed that
a bottleneck for the efficacy of OV was poor distribution of virus in the human brain. To overcome this
challenge, over the last SPORE funding period, we investigated the feasibility and safety of delivering
oncolytic adenovirus to the peri-tumoral brain of malignant glioma patients using neural stem cells (NSC)
which can carry OV, and migrate to distant tumor pockets infiltrating the brain. We conducted a Phase 1 trial
in which we showed the feasibility, safety and established a maximally-tolerated dose for this therapy
(NCT03072134) and published the results in Lancet Oncology. The next step in this program is to perform a
phase II trial to investigate the efficacy of OV using overall survival as an endpoint for efficacy. However, a
phase II trial needs to be optimized via additional studies proposed in this continuation of funding by 1)
enabling multiple injections over time, to be accomplished through a novel brain parenchymal catheter-based
delivery system (Renishaw ®). 2) maximizing NSC viability and OV production using N-acetylcystein Amide
(NACA), which we showed to enhance delivery and efficacy of this therapy, and 3) a priori-identification of
patients with tumors that are susceptible to OV. We hypothesize that only a subset of patients might have
tumors that are susceptible to OV, and that identification of susceptible tumors will allow elucidation of an
efficacy signal. In this continued renewal of Project 1, we now propose the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Conduct a phase 1B expansion trial utilizing a novel catheter method to deliver multiple
injections of product in newly diagnosed malignant gliomas
Specific Aim 2: Examine the pre-existing tumor microenvironment, the effect of NACA on viral replication, and
the immune response during NSC-OV therapy in malignant glioma patients.
Specific Aim 3: Validate genes that are implicated in glioma susceptibility to oncolytic virus using paired
analysis of pre-treatment and during-treatment human glioma specimens"
10898592,"PROJECT 2: SUMMARY
The glioblastoma (GBM) microenvironment is dominated by myeloid cell infiltrates. Results from multiple studies
indicate these tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMS) as supporting GBM growth. The goal of this project is to
reprogram TAMS for immunologic anti-tumor activity. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a widely expressed
sensor of cellular stress that is activated by the presence of DNA in the cytoplasm. Distinct from most other immune
agonists, STING activation re-educates tumor supportive M2 macrophage TAMS toward a proinflammatory anti-
tumor M1 phenotype. Macrophage proinflammatory phenotypic conversion, in turn, promotes cytotoxic T cell
infiltration of and activity against tumor. We have developed a high potency STING agonist, IACS-8803, with
marked antitumor activity when tested in humanized mice bearing human GBM, and in canines with
spontaneously arising high-grade gliomas. In addressing the clinical potential of this agonist in treating GBM, we
will first determine its effect on interferon responses, using [18F]FLT PET, when IACS-8803 is administered to
patients with recurrent tumor. This first-in-man Phase I clinical trial will inform regarding the range in IACS-8803
activity that is observed across the cohort of treated patients, with activity results compared against tumor
molecular characteristics, and patient clinical data. The clinical trial will include analysis of several unique
endpoints, among which are target engagement and longitudinal kinetics of IACS-8803 induced T cell chemokine
expression such as CXCL10. In addition, a window-of-opportunity patient cohort will receive direct intratumoral
administration of IACS-8803, and whose results will be compared against those from patients that have received
systemic administration of standard-of-care therapeutics. The PET Imaging results will be analyzed with respect
to inflammatory immune response in resected tumors from active vs. non-active tracer regions in post-STING
treated subjects, using multiplex immunofluorescence, CyTOF, and/or mass cytometry. This clinical study will
ultimately provide sufficient data to make a clear go/no go determination for later-stage clinical trials based on
sufficient target engagement in the tumor microenvironment. While conducting this clinical trial, we will move
forward with preclinical research by evaluating the efficacy of combined IAC-8803 + radiation in orthotopic
models of GBM. Results from these preclinical studies will inform whether STING agonist and radiation treatment
should be tested in patients with newly diagnosed GBM, and whose tumors have unmethylated MGMT promoter,
and as such, do not require treatment with temozolomide."

10843861,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Endometriosis, which causes pain in the pelvis and lower abdomen, afflicts 1 in 10 women between 15 and 49
years of age in the United States. Nearly half of these women experience chronic pelvic pain, and many find that
available treatments (hormone therapy and surgery) have negative side effects and do not prevent recurrences.
A well-accepted theory is that endometriosis occurs when endometrial tissue enters the peritoneal cavity via
retrograde menstruation and implants onto pelvic organs and peritoneal surfaces. However, whereas up to 90%
of women experience retrograde menstruation, only 10% of women develop endometriosis, suggesting that
unknown factors contribute to development of endometriosis. Thus, identifying such causal factors is essential
to develop new tools to diagnose and treat this painful disease. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that
whereas some gut bacteria promote endometriosis by inducing macrophage-mediated inflammation, others
protect against endometriosis by fermenting fiber to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). This idea is built
on several key pieces of preliminary and published data. First, in a syngeneic injection model of endometriosis,
microbiota-depleted mice developed significantly smaller endometriotic lesions and had less peritoneal
inflammation than control mice. However, lesion size was restored in mice orally gavaged with feces from mice
with endometriosis. Second, the peritoneal fluid of mice with endometriosis contained less of the SCFAs acetate,
propionate, and butyrate than peritoneal fluid from mice without endometriosis. Third, butyrate inhibited both in
vivo endometriotic lesion growth in mice and in vitro growth of human cells derived from endometriotic lesions.
Finally, recent reports indicate that women with endometriosis have different gut bacteria compositions than
women without endometriosis. The work proposed here will build on these strong preliminary data and test the
hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: (Aim 1) Determine the mechanism by which gut bacteria
promote endometriosis; (Aim 2) Determine the mechanism by which SCFAs affect endometriosis; (Aim 3) Identify
human gut bacteria associated with endometriosis, and determine the effect of gut bacteria on human
endometriosis growth in mice. At the level of basic science, this project will identify gut bacteria and inflammatory
profiles that confer sensitivity to developing endometriosis and identify mechanisms by which SCFAs protect
against endometriosis. Of translational significance, this work will identify bacterial candidates that promote or
protect against endometriosis in reproductive-age women. Together, this work will help advance one of the
Aspirational Goals stated in the NICHD 2020 Strategic Plan: to ""accelerate efforts to definitively diagnose,
prevent, and treat endometriosis""."

HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) most commonly target the High Mannose Patch (HMP), a
mannose-rich region of HIV Env in the vicinity of the V3 loop and the N332 glycan. HMP bnAbs (e.g.,
2G12, PGT128, BG18) tend to recognize non-reducing-terminal Man1α-2Man moieties within
oligomannose glycans; however, in immunizations with oligomannose glycoconjugates, antibodies are
rarely raised against Man1a-2Man, and instead bind to core motifs of the glycan. We hypothesize that in
vivo mannosidase trimming of Man1a-2Man termini is a major reason why antibodies do not develop
against this motif. In Aim 1, we will prepare stabilized oligomannose glycans, in which a sulfur linkage
prevents mannosidase cleavage of the Man1α-2Man, but structurally mimics the natural glycan and is
recognized by bnAbs. In Aim 2, we will immunize rabbits with CRM197 glycoconjugates containing the
stabilized or unstabilized glycans and compare the resulting antibodies’ HIV Env binding and
neutralization activity. We will also intensively characterize the ability of these antibodies to bind Man1a-
2Man using an oligomannose-focused glycan array."

HIV infection impacts over 37 million individuals, with over 2/3 of these patients receiving antiretroviral therapies
(ART). ART is sustained for a patient’s life and can lead to the emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1. To combat
drug-resistance, an improved and diverse set of antiretrovirals are needed for clinical use. To this extent, the
HIV-1 capsid is an excellent target for antiretroviral therapies as it has numerous, essential roles throughout the
HIV-1 replication cycle. Compounds that target the capsid protein (CA), known as capsid effectors (CEs), offer
a novel class of HIV-1 antivirals for potential clinical use. One CE with marked success is lenacapavir, developed
by Gilead Sciences. Lenacapavir is exceptionally potent, however, early results show treatment with lenacapavir
can cause the emergence of antiviral-resistant HIV-1. Our lab has previously reported highly potent antiretrovirals
that target the same site as lenacapavir, within the FG-binding pocket. Compounds that bind to the FG-binding
pocket of CA mimic a conserved phenylalanine-glycine (FG) dipeptide motif found in many host factors reported
to bind CA. Here, I will characterize structural changes to the HIV-1 capsid upon treatment with highly potent
CEs that bind the FG-binding pocket and calculate the biochemical parameters of CA•CE interactions for this
class of antiretroviral therapeutics. The nature of CA•CE interactions will be assessed in wild-type (WT) and
drug-resistant viruses to further our understanding of antiviral resistance. Electron microscopy (EM) will be used
to visualize drug-resistant capsid assemblies and discern structural changes relative to WT assemblies (AIM 1).
Rates of capsid assembly and changes to thermal stability upon drug-treatment will be calculated using assays
designed to probe CA•CA interactions (AIM 2). These aims will study mutations that confer antiviral-resistance
and results will be compared to WT CA to identify those with similar phenotypes and therefore higher risks of
resistance. Further, CA•CE biochemical parameters of affinity and dissociation rates will be solved by label-free
optical detection. This study will further our mechanistic understanding of compounds that bind to the FG-binding
pocket of CA. Overall, these results will enable future research to strategically improve antiretrovirals, aiming to
combat the HIV-1 epidemic."
10757919,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
The overall goal of this project is to understand how the HIV-1 5′-leader RNA differentially directs diverse
functions during viral replication, including intracellular trafficking, initiation of translation, recruitment of viral
structural proteins (called Gag), and nucleation of virus assembly. Proposed studies build on our recent
discovery that HIV-1 RNAs are transcribed with one, two or three 5ʹ-guanosines via alternate (heterogeneous)
transcriptional start site usage – a new paradigm in HIV-1 RNA biology. Our studies revealed that 5′-capped
transcripts that begin with a single guanosine (Cap1G) adopt a structure that sequesters the 5′-cap, promotes
dimerization, and exposes Gag binding sites, thereby promoting their functions as genomes (gRNA). In
contrast, 5′-capped transcripts that begin with two or three guanosines (Cap2G/Cap3G) adopt monomeric
structures with an exposed 5′-cap that function in splicing and translation (mRNAs). The central hypothesis
guiding our proposed studies is that cap sequestration enables the HIV-1 gRNA to avoid capture by the cellular
RNA processing and translation machinery, and that a small number of Gag proteins (~2 dozen) are
cooperatively recruited to assembly sites on a well-defined packaging signal (ΨCES) located within the gRNA 5′-
leader. We now aim to identify molecular determinants of alternate transcription initiation and exploit this
knowledge to differentially examine HIV-1 mRNA and gRNA trafficking and interactions in cells, probe RNA
structural changes that occur during virus assembly and maturation, and identify key interactions that promote
Gag:RNA assembly and might be exploited for drug targeting. Preliminary NMR and EM findings suggest that it
should now be possible to determine the 3D structure of the Gag:RNA complex that nucleates HIV-1 virus
particle assembly.
NMR studies of large RNAs and protein-RNA complexes are technically challenging – the average size of
NMR-derived RNA structures in the RNA Structure Database is only 30 nucleotides. But the potential payoff of
the proposed studies is substantial and could ultimately lead not only to a more detailed understanding of how
HIV-1 replicates, but also to the development of new approaches for the treatment of AIDS and to the
engineering of gene delivery vectors with improved packaging efficiencies."

Early HIV diagnosis is an essential component of the strategy to End the HIV Epidemic (EHE). Yet, half of the
nearly 40,000 Americans who test positive for HIV every year have late (stage 3 AIDS) infection, which results
in higher community transmission and poorer treatment outcomes. In the United States South, where HIV is
disproportionately impacted, 50% of HIV infections are undiagnosed. Infrequent or delayed HIV testing is most
often due to poor healthcare access and stigmatizing attitudes about HIV that inhibit prevention and treatment
seeking. Thus, increased HIV testing access and uptake is urgently needed to normalize HIV testing and direct
individuals to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) if they test HIV negative or HIV treatment if they test HIV
positive. To increase HIV testing access and uptake, we propose integrating HIV prevention services
within community pharmacies located in neighborhoods with high HIV prevalence. Despite promising
evidence of feasibility of pharmacy-based HIV testing, it is not widely available. In fact, most local pharmacy
boards lack policy guidance on HIV testing being within their scope of practice. Our work has shown that HIV
testing uptake in community pharmacies can be increased if it is offered with less stigmatized non-HIV-related
services (e.g., COVID19, blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol screening). But many community pharmacy
staff report inadequate training as barriers to integrating HIV testing into the pharmacy work system. Therefore,
to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of HIV testing and prevention services within community
pharmacies we propose a hybrid type 1 study design that aims to 1) Examine the policy-, pharmacy staff- and
client-level barriers and facilitators of adopting HIV prevention services (e.g., HIV testing, PrEP referral, HIV
treatment referral) in community pharmacies, 2) Develop and implement pharmacy staff HIV prevention service
(e.g., HIV testing and counseling, PrEP referral, HIV treatment referral) trainings, and 3) Test the effects of
integrating HIV prevention services in community pharmacies with existing non-HIV-related screenings versus
those without on effectiveness and implementation outcomes. Guided by the Exploration, Preparation,
Implementation, Sustainment framework, this study will include an exploration phase that examines the
barriers and facilitators to pharmacy-based HIV prevention service provision across the US South using online
surveys of community pharmacy staff (n=300), and in-depth interviews of Board of pharmacy members (n=16)
and pharmacy staff (n=40). In the preparation phase, a virtual community pharmacy HIV prevention training
will be developed and offered to 150 community pharmacy staff. Finally, in the implementation and
sustainment phase, we will evaluate the acceptability and sustainment of the HIV prevention service delivery
over 12 months in 10 community pharmacies (5 pharmacies who offer primary prevention screenings vs. 5
pharmacies who do not). Findings will be used to support scaling HIV prevention services in community
pharmacies in the South where efforts to reduce HIV transmission are desperately needed to EHE."

The central goal of the Oklahoma C. difficile U19 program is to advance a second-generation vaccine for C.

Given that the U19 program has 3 distinct but complementary Research Projects and that synergistic interaction
between those projects is desirable, standardization of the challenge experiments is a prudent and essential

TcdB lacking a key cell entry sequence. This mutant is unable to interact with cells but appears to retain aspects
critical to promoting a neutralizing antibody response. This vaccine candidate will be further optimized and
modified to ensure stability and a total absence of toxicity. Comparisons will be made between this mutant and
a toxoid of TcdB. Next, the TcdB derivative will be used in combination with a polysaccharide antigen derived
from C. difficile to generate a novel combination vaccine. All vaccine candidates will be tested for protection
against C. difficile disease in a mouse model and the most promising of those will be further tested in a hamster
model of infection. Using strains of C. difficile genetically engineered to express inactive TcdB, we will also
determine if C. difficile inactivates key immune cells needed to provide effective memory responses in vaccinated

this pathogen can subvert their effectiveness."

Telomeres, the specialized structures at chromosome ends, are comprised of TTAGGG repeats, telomere repeat
containing RNA (TERRA), and the shelterin protein complex. Sister chromatids are held together from the time
of their replication in S phase until their separation in mitosis by cohesin rings. Ring-mediated cohesion is
essential to ensure accurate distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells in mitosis. Cohesion between sisters
is also important for recombination and repair, particularly at repetitive sequences like telomeres, where it keeps
them aligned. For this, more intimate contacts (in addition to the cohesin ring) are needed and as such, there
are telomere-specific requirements for cohesion. Establishment of cohesion at telomeres requires shelterin
subunits and associated proteins. Resolution of cohesion between telomeres requires the PARP, tankyrase.
Tankyrase localizes to telomeres by binding to the TTAGGG-repeat binding shelterin subunit TRF1, in late S/G2
to resolve cohesion. In tankyrase-depleted cells sister telomeres remain cohered in mitosis despite normal
resolution of arms and centromeres. This persistent telomere cohesion is not just an aberrant state induced by
depletion of tankyrase, it occurs naturally in certain human cell types that lack telomerase and have critically
short telomeres: normal aged cells and cancer ALT cells. Unexpectedly, (and shown by our lab in the last few
years) this persistent cohesion is beneficial to cells; it serves a protective role to prevent premature senescence
in aged cells and growth arrest in ALT cancer cells. The goal of our research for the next five years is to elucidate
the proteins and mechanisms required for establishment and resolution of cohesion. We will build on our previous
work where we identified shelterin subunits and associated factors that are required for cohesion and we will
focus on our most recent discovery indicating a role for RNA (TERRA and TERRA R-Loops) in telomere
cohesion. We will determine how the telomeric components contribute to the establishment, maintenance, and
resolution of telomere cohesion in normal human cells, aging, and cancer. For cohesion establishment, we will
determine how and when the required proteins are deposited on telomeres and how far into the chromosome
they extend. For cohesion resolution, we will determine how recruitment of tankyrase serves to resolve cohesion.
We will characterize the proteins that tankyrase itself recruits to telomeres and investigate how tankyrase uses
functional compartmentalization to orchestrate the resolution process. We will determine how TERRA RNA and
TERRA R-loops contribute to telomere cohesion in normal cells and to persistent telomere cohesion in
pathological conditions of aging and ALT cancer. And finally, we will elucidate the full proteome of the cohered
telomeric state. Ultimately, a complete understanding of telomere cohesion will elucidate fundamental
mechanisms of chromosome stability and genome integrity in normal human cells and provide insights into
prevention of premature senescence in aging cells and into promotion of premature death in ALT cancer cells."

Therapies for asthma that target type-2 (T2) inflammation are ineffective in many patients with asthma in part
due to the increasing number of individuals with non-T2 asthma who have a suboptimal response to standard
therapy with inhaled corticosteroids or biologics targeting T2 cytokines. Millions of viral-triggered asthma
exacerbations occur annually in this group of patients in the U.S. leading to significant morbidity and cost to the
health care system, due in part to the lack of effective treatments for non-T2 asthma for children and adults.
The clinical features and airway inflammatory cell infiltrate patterns of non-T2 asthma have been characterized
in detail, but the specific role of the airway epithelium in coordinating immune cell responses and influencing
exacerbations, lung function, and persistent inflammation in donors with non-T2 asthma remains poorly
characterized. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that airway epithelial cells (AECs) from non-T2 asthmatic
children exhibit more robust type I and III interferon (IFN) responses and greater “non-T2 cytokine” (IL-1β,
TNF-α, IL-17C, and GCSF) production following RV infection as compared to AECs from T2-high donors. In
Project 2, we will use bronchial AECs from well characterized cohorts of children and adults with and without
asthma to conduct mechanistic ex vivo experiments using organotypic models, to test our central hypothesis
that in non-T2 asthma RV infection triggers excessive epithelial production of non-T2 cytokines and/or
excessive IFN responses that activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to neutrophilic inflammation, airway
remodeling, and lung function decline through interactions with Th17 cells and/or lung macrophages. We will
extend our ex vivo AEC model to include coculture studies of AECs with both Th17 and lung macrophages,
and specifically assess bidirectional interactions utilizing bulk and single cell transcriptomics to assess
epithelial-dependent neutrophil activation. We will also utilize cutting edge bioinformatics techniques to assess
the genomic and epigenetic alterations in the epithelium that drive non-T2 inflammation as well as relevant in
vivo modeling of HRV infection in the setting of non-T2 inflammation."

Organophosphate (OP) anticholinesterases, e.g., nerve agents and some insecticides, present a threat to the
civilian population via terrorist activity or accidents. These OP compounds or metabolites are potent and
persistent inhibitors of central and peripheral nervous system acetylcholinesterase (AChE). High dose OP
exposures can lead to seizures, respiratory failure and death. Survivors may suffer from brain damage and
behavioral deficits. One of these OP insecticides, phorate, is very acutely toxic making it a potential threat.
Unlike the nerve agents, phorate requires bioactivation to its anticholinesterase metabolites (oxons) which
results in a delay (4-5 h) in toxic signs (tremors, salivation, and seizure-like behavior). The current therapy (US)
for severe OP poisoning includes atropine plus the oxime AChE reactivator 2-PAM. A major limitation of 2-
PAM is its relatively short plasma half-life and inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and protect the
brain. Our laboratories have invented and patented a series of oximes that have shown survival efficacy and
attenuation of seizure-like behavior and neuropathology following exposure of rats to high levels of nerve agent
surrogates and one OP insecticidal metabolite (paraoxon). The delay in toxic signs following phorate challenge
makes the timing of oxime administration and oxime plasma half-life important in establishing an effective
therapeutic regimen. Our lead novel oximes have demonstrated longer plasma half-lives compared to 2-PAM
which should be beneficial combating OPs that have delays in initiation of the cholinergic crisis. Some of our
novel oximes can also effectively reactivate butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibited by the anticholinesterase
metabolites of OPs including phorate. BChE is prominent in serum and is inhibited by circulating oxons. An
oxime that can effectively reactivate BChE, creating a pseudo-catalytic bio-scavenger of circulating oxons,
could prevent or attenuate OP-induced toxicity. The Aims of this project are: 1) Characterize the temporal
relationship between ChE inhibition and the phorate toxidrome, and the survival efficacy provided by 3
novel oximes; 2) Demonstrate in vitro (rat and human) and in vivo (male and female rats) with a down-
selected lead novel oxime the ability to reactivate phorate inhibited BChE and enhance survival. The
challenge dosage of phorate will be lethal (LD99) to rats receiving atropine only. A novel oxime or 2-PAM will
be administered at the initiation of seizure-like behavior and at one earlier time point prior to initiation of
cholinergic crisis. In addition, oxime-mediated reactivation of OP-inhibited BChE will allow a demonstration that
pseudo-catalytic BChE-mediated destruction of OP can attenuate toxicity. A selective BChE inhibitor will be
used to confirm the significance of BChE reactivation, as evidenced by a reduction of AChE inhibition and
lethality in oxime-treated rats having functional BChE (rats not receiving the BChE inhibitor). The data from this
translational project will be used to further develop an oxime into a more effective therapeutic for poisoning by
insecticidal OPs, like phorate, that display a delayed toxidrome because they require bioactivation."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder which in early stages is characterized by the migration of macrophages
and modified lipoproteins into the arterial walls, leading to the formation and apoptosis of macrophage foam cells. In late
stages of disease, insufficient apoptotic foam cell removal by macrophages leads to their secondary necrosis and plaque
development. Plaque damage by pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteases and oxygen radicals can lead to clinical
complications such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Thus, macrophage foam cell survival, cholesterol
removal, and inflammation are key factors in progression of this disease. Complement pathway activation by innate
immune protein C1q has been shown to promote disease progression. However, studies in C1q-deficient mice suggest a
protective role for C1q in the early atherosclerotic lesion. In addition to complement activation, C1q can directly opsonize
targets and interacts with phagocytes leading to increased phagocytic responses and reduced inflammatory cytokine
signaling. Macrophages can synthesize C1q and therefore C1q may be localized in macrophage-rich tissues, such as the
early atherosclerotic lesion, in the absence of other complement components needed for complement activation. Therefore,
our central hypothesis is that complement-independent actions of C1q program protective, anti-atherosclerotic
macrophage responses in atherosclerosis. Recent studies have identified a number of potentially beneficial mechanisms
of C1q on macrophage survival, efferocytosis, cholesterol metabolism, and inflammatory polarization in vitro and in vivo
models of atherosclerosis. The goal of this project is to investigate pathways and biological relevance of C1q modulation of
cholesterol metabolism, and to determine for the first time if there is a role for C1q in mitochondrial metabolism in
macrophage foam cells. Specific aims are: 1: Investigate C1q modulation of lipid metabolism in macrophages and
microglia. We will test the hypothesis that C1q modulation of LXR-activating lipids 24-OHC, 25-OHC, and desmosterol
are involved in macrophage foam cell survival, efferocytosis and polarization. Lipidomic analysis will be performed in
primary human M0, M1, or M2 polarized macrophage foam cells and murine microglia ±C1q. Survival, efferocytosis, and
polarization assays will be performed in specific pathway-deficient or knocked-down macrophages to identify their relative
importance in these biological responses. Specific Aim 2: Investigate C1q modulation of macrophage metabolic
programming. We will test the hypothesis that C1q modulation of mitochondrial metabolism and autophagy are involved
in macrophage foam cell survival, efferocytosis, and polarization. Changes to mitochondrial respiration, glycolysis and
superoxide production will be measured in human monocyte-derived macrophages during ingestion of oxLDL ±C1q.
Similar studies will be performed in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild-type or C1q-deficient mice to
investigate autocrine vs. paracrine actions of C1q. Assays will be repeated in macrophages ingesting oxLDL ±C1q in the
presence of autophagy (or other metabolic pathway) inhibitors, or cultured in high glucose environment to identify
involvement of metabolic pathways in these biological responses. Overall, these studies aim to explore the dual role that
C1q plays in atherosclerosis, and should assist in identifying novel molecular pathways for therapeutic targeting."

The mission of the proposed Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE)
program at University of North Florida (UNF) is to significantly increase the proportion of students from
underrepresented (UR) ethnic/racial minority or economically disadvantaged groups completing undergraduate
degrees and PhD or MD/PhD programs in biomedical sciences. We propose to develop this U-RISE program
across the UNF Biology, Chemistry, and Physics Departments; 44% of students from these programs are from
UR ethnic/racial minority or economically disadvantaged groups. The UNF Biomedical Sciences program bridges
these UNF departments with Mayo Clinic Florida, a major research-intensive academic medical center six miles
from UNF. This provides a strong foundation for the proposed program via established inter-institutional
initiatives that provide undergraduate research training. Pre-U-RISE scholars will be selected in spring of their
freshman year. With full financial support from UNF, scholars will begin the pre-U-RISE program in the summer
before sophomore year and gain critical experience in the responsible conduct of research as well as research
training at UNF or Mayo Clinic during their sophomore year to promote student retention. Pre-U-RISE scholars
will matriculate into the U-RISE program during the summer prior to junior year. As U-RISE scholars, students
will complete two summer internships, with at least one at a research intense institution (i.e. Mayo Clinic,
University of Central Florida, Florida State University). Scholars will also pursue academic year research at Mayo
Clinic or UNF, building their scientific identity and achieving full immersion in research. Through research,
scholars will develop myriad technical, operational, and professional skills. Other key aspects of the proposed
program include three-tier academic/research/peer mentoring, outreach, and professional development activities
that foster trainee independence, collaboration, and communication skills. These all represent evidence-based
interventions for increasing the persistence of students from UR groups in biomedical science. The proposed
program includes four major objectives: 1) Early identification and recruitment of students from UR groups
(minority/economically disadvantaged) and mentoring starting at end of freshman year; 2) a rigorous academic
preparedness program with continuous academic year research experiences at UNF or Mayo Clinic Florida; 3)
two summer research experiences; and, 4) a support system achieved through individualized mentoring,
advising, and continuous academic and financial support. Through these objectives, our U-RISE program aims
to yield outcomes that include increasing the 4-year graduation rate for scholars by >2-fold above current UNF
baselines and creating a diverse cohort of students that matriculate into graduate programs. This will ultimately
enhance the regional biomedical science training environment and increase workforce diversity."
10873700,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by a cognitively
asymptomatic preclinical stage which is identified and monitored via longitudinal tracking of pathophysiological
biomarkers, e.g., tau and amyloid. Since the aggregation of tau protein tangles in the medial temporal lobe is a
key driver of memory impairment, accurate image-based longitudinal prediction of tau burden could fill a critical
gap in biomarker development for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. Tau tangles exhibit stereotypical
neuroanatomical patterns of spatiotemporal spread that correlate strongly with the progression of
neurodegeneration. Studies in animal models have suggested that the characteristic patterns of tau spread
associated with Alzheimer’s progression are determined by neural connectivity rather than physical proximity
between different brain regions. Graph-theoretic methods that utilize macroscale structural connectivity mapping
in humans to predict future tau burden could lead to valuable prognostic tools for Alzheimer’s disease. The
overarching research goal of this R01 Research Project Grant is to develop an interpretable machine learning
model that uses individual structural connectomics to make personalized predictions of differential measures of
tau from multimodal baseline data. Our approach relies on longitudinal 18F-Flortaucipir positron emission
tomography (PET) for the imaging of tau tangles, 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) for the imaging of amyloid
plaques, and high-angular-resolution diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for individualized structural
connectomics in human subjects. We will develop a physics-informed and interpretable graph neural network to
predict the annual rate of change of the regional tau burden from multimodal inputs, including baseline tau, Aβ,
and an array of structural connectivity metrics. We will also develop novel physics-based analytic models for tau
progression, which will be used to effectively guide the machine learning framework. Finally, we will apply the
machine learning model to investigate the earliest cortical site of tau aggregation, to examine the connectomic
basis of early tau spread, and to leverage our model’s interpretability to discover and validate novel connectomic
biomarkers to characterize preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To validate the machine learning model, we will use
serial tau PET data at two and three timepoints from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, one of the largest
longitudinal imaging resources for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To ensure scientific rigor, secondary
validation of the models will be performed using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
database. The proposed personalized predictive model could significantly impact preclinical Alzheimer’s
prognosis, facilitate ongoing clinical trials, and shed light on the neuroconnectomic and biological underpinnings
of Alzheimer’s disease."
10853057,"Project Summary/Abstract
Helminths (i.e., parasitic worms) infect all vertebrate taxa. Hosts generally evolve to block, purge, or limit the
negative effects of infection, and parasites evolve to hide from or manipulate host physiology. Numerous
molecules and cellular pathways are known to modulate interactions between vertebrate hosts and helminth
parasites, but little is known about how the evolution of immunity and infectivity influences natural variation in
parasite infections. Data on the particular genetic differences that underlie evolved differences in immunity are
similarly limited. Over the next five years, my lab will describe the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary history
of coevolution between a small fish with abundant ecological and genetic resources, the threespine stickleback
(Gasterosteus aculeatus), and one of its cestode parasites. This work is facilitated by lab-based protocols to
efficiently intercross cestodes, expose sticklebacks to controlled doses of these pathogens, co-culture host and
immune cells in vitro, and assays of host immunity and parasite viability. We can not only identify and measure
heritable traits that affect infection specificity and intensity, but also apply modern genetic approaches to
dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying this naturally selected variation. Our preliminary data show that
threespine sticklebacks repeatedly evolved to block the initial establishment and subsequent growth of
cestodes, but that the mechanisms of resistance vary across populations. Cestodes also evolved to counteract
the defenses of their local hosts, eventually leading to specialization on a subset of hosts. We will use forward
genetics to map the chromosomal loci associated with pathogen-driven host evolution, while crossing diverged
cestode populations will uncover loci evolving due to host-driven selection. This work will be complemented
with pharmacological and transgenic manipulations of candidate genes and molecular pathways, as well as
forays into natural settings where we will use both experimental transplants and time-series data to understand
how coevolution varies due to ecological and spatial constraints. Perhaps most exciting, there are several
closely related stickleback species and cestode species that, despite millions of years of divergence, remain
interfertile, and which enable us to characterize the genetics of coevolution across both micro- and
macroevolutionary timescales."
10792946,"Apathy is the most prevalent behavioral symptom in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders
(ADRD). In older adults, presence of apathy is associated with faster cognitive decline, lower brain
volumes and with a higher burden of Amyloid β, tau pathology and white matter hyperintensities. Thus,
in old age, apathy is an important behavioral marker of incipient dementia and its underlying pathology.
Midlife is a critical period for intervening against risk factors for ADRD and when the neurobiological
substrates underlying ADRD begin to aggregate. However, the cognitive and ADRD-related brain
correlates of apathy in midlife are essentially unknown.
 Apathy is a multidimensional construct encompassing three main components: narrowed emotional
reactivity, limited cognitive effort and curiosity and reduced goal- directed behavior. The identification
of its cognitive and brain correlates requires a granular approach, which considers these distinct
components. We will study the relationship of apathy and its components with cognitive function and
ADRD-related brain markers in 500 cognitively asymptomatic middle aged offspring of ADRD patients,
participants of the Israel Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (IRAP) study. IRAP participants are deeply
phenotyped for cognitive, behavioral, health, lifestyle, brain imaging and genetic factors. Quantification
of apathy will be based on: (1) Participants' and informants' report on apathy via validated
questionnaires; and (2) Objective measurement of apathy- based on autonomic nervous system (ANS)
and gaze reactivity to emotional and cognitive stimuli. The emotional component of apathy will be
measured via ANS and gaze reactivity to emotional visual stimuli; The cognitive component will be
measured via gaze reactivity to cognitive stimuli and by participants' willingness to invest cognitive effort
in a reward-dependent cognitive task. Participants' report on the type and duration of cognitive, social
and physical activities they performed without being prompted will assess the behavioral component.
If our hypotheses are corroborated, these innovative, simple to use, objective measures of different
components of apathy may facilitate diagnostic accuracy and disentangling their unique value in the
prediction of cognitive decline. The study will provide new knowledge on the cognitive and brain
correlates of apathy in middle aged individuals at high ADRD risk and will set the basis for examining
the longitudinal consequences of midlife apathy on cognitive decline."

This proposal requests a further five years of funding to support the organization and delivery of in-person and
virtual intensive training workshops focused on the development of skills in statistical, behavioral, and
quantitative genetics that will advance the mission of NIMH. Four workshops will be in-person over one week
and one will be virtual across two weeks. We also request funding to support the development of a website
devoted to self-education of this material and that will greatly increase the reach of the workshop. The
workshop and its associated website are targeted at post-doctoral trainees, graduate and medical students, and
early career faculty currently conducting or planning to initiate research on the genetics of mental health. To
balance the needs of investigators using a variety of methodologies, our in-person workshops will alternate
between a focus on structural equation modeling of twin, family, multivariate, and developmental data (the
“Latent Genetics Course”), and a workshop focusing on the analysis of measured genome variation including
sequence data (the “Molecular Genetics Course”). The virtual course will cover both content areas with a
slightly more introductory focus. The website will be a central hub for learning statistical genetics of all content
types. It will be made up of video lectures, practicals, code, and relevant readings along with a forum, all
organized by topic and cross-referenced.
Through both didactics and hands-on experience, research scientists participating in the workshops will refine
their research skills in genetic design and analysis. The workshop offers an innovative program designed to
provide education in state-of-the-art genetic methodology important to fulfill the objectives of the current
NIMH Strategic Plan. Although designed for training, the live (in-person and virtual) workshops share some
characteristics of a scientific meeting. Participants are encouraged to discuss their current research, to bring
copies of their data to work on directly while at the workshop, and to discuss and develop research plans. New
collaborations are established to facilitate high quality research on existing data sets, and new research
initiatives are strengthened by collaborations formed at the workshop. Its curriculum is continuously updated
by world leaders in statistical, behavioral, and quantitative genetics and their applications to mental health.
This workshop has historically been one of the most important gateways to behavioral, statistical, and
quantitative genetics. It has logged ~3,000 registrations since its inception in 1987. A large proportion of
authors of papers with keywords such as “GWAS” and “twin studies” have attended the workshop and many
leaders in the field got their start at it. The proposed workshop formats (in-person, virtual, and online)
represent a modernization of how content is delivered and have already born fruit in terms of increased reach
and diversity."

 Support is requested for continuation of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Aging
Research Training Program. The principal goal of the Aging Research Training Program is to prepare clinician-
investigators for careers in aging research, particularly within academic Divisions of Geriatric Medicine and in
other clinical disciplines that play a major role in caring for older adults. The program places special focus on
Patient-Oriented Aging Research, although exceptional investigators from all domains of aging research are
welcome.
 The Aging Research Training Program aims to develop skills in key areas, including formulation of
research questions, design of observational and experimental studies, techniques for execution of study
design, critical analysis and interpretation of findings, verbal and written scientific communication, and career
development strategies including pathways of entry into successful research careers. The Program has three
concurrent components. The first component is an intensive curriculum in clinical research methods,
culminating in a master's degree. The second component is a series of interactive and “case-based” seminars
related to aging research, including weekly research works-in-progress conferences. The third component is a
mentored research project, which is the cornerstone of the training experience. The program culminates in
presentation of research findings at national scientific meetings, submission of at least two peer-reviewed
research reports for publication, and preparation of a grant application.
 The Aging Research Training Program attracts highly qualified MD and PhD candidates. Trainees are
selected for their potential to establish themselves as independent investigators and academic leaders in aging
research. Over the last 6 funding cycles, the program has succeeded in recruiting and retaining outstanding
trainees and progressing fellows into research-oriented faculty positions with a high success rate in obtaining
competitive career development awards.
 In recent years we have had to turn away outstanding applicants interested in aging research. Our
program is already full, contingent on funding, for the next two years. Being full limits our ability to attract
candidates interested in aging research to our clinical geriatrics fellowship, which is the core feeder program
for the Aging Research Training Program. Therefore, we request funding for three postdoctoral fellows in each
of two research training years, a modest increase compared to prior years."
10837774,"Abstract
The effect of aging on the human brain shows wide individual variation ranging from early onset Alzheimer's
disease (AD) to maintenance of cognitive clarity into the 10th decade. The challenge is to understand why
aging can have such disparate outcomes, and why it contributes so profoundly to the risk of neurodegenerative
disease. We have examined aging and AD from the perspective of molecular pathways that underlie memory
consolidation and determined that a gene termed NPTX2 provides an important clue to human cognitive
failure. NPTX2 is expressed by pyramidal neurons and secreted at their excitatory synapses on parvalbumin
interneurons (PV) to control inhibitory circuit function. NPTX2 and markers of PV function are prominently
down-regulated in the brain of humans with AD, and CSF levels of NPTX2 correlate with both disease state
and cognitive performance. NPTX2 is not down-regulated in the brains of individuals who maintain cognitive
clarity despite amyloid accumulation (asymptomatic AD). These and other findings support the hypothesis that
NPTX2 is associated with brain resilience critical for cognition and fails in the shift from healthy to unhealthy
aging. Aim 1 will identify signaling pathways associated with preserved or deteriorated NPTX2 expression
across the spectrum from older individuals with exceptional cognition to those with AD. Studies use an
approach of targeted proteomics combined with bulk and single nuclei RNAseq, and will specifically examine
the hypothesis that NPTX2 loss-of-function is associated with changes in interneuron cell properties. Aim 2
extends the goals of Aim 1 to establish the cellular mechanism of NPTX2 down-regulation using isogenic
human iPS neurons encoding familial mutations of APP and PS1. iPS neurons with fAD mutations show
profound and specific reductions of NPTX2 expression and provide an extraordinary opportunity to isolate and
validate critical disease pathways. Analyses will include TMT differential mass spectroscopy and RNAseq.
Candidate pathways will be manipulated and tested using CRISPR and pharmacological approaches. Aim 3
will provide the first test of the hypothesis that NPTX2 loss of function (LOF) in the adult brain is causal for
circuit dysfunction and cognitive decline in the context of AD pathogenesis. Experiments use a newly
established rat genetic model for conditional deletion of NPTX2 in a transgenic APP/PS1 AD model (Tg344-
AD). Analyses will include high density electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal subregions CA1 and
CA3 together with behavior tests and histopathological assessments of AD markers. Single nuclei RNAseq
performed in CA3 will define the signature of NPTX2 LOF in the context of amyloid pathology. These data will
be cross-referenced with findings from Aims 1 and 2 as part of an integrated interspecies analysis of the cause
and consequences of NPTX2 LOF. Combined studies will deepen our understanding mechanisms that can
confer cognitive health or bias the brain towards disease."

 The goal of this project is to understand how quantity and quality of the language input directed to
children by their caregivers is influenced by genetically-influenced child characteristics (language ability as
measured by standard assessment as well as children's productions during the interactions, and temperament
as measured by standard assessments). The overarching activity of this research project is transcription and
analysis of naturalistic parent-child interactions that have already been collected as part of a longitudinal study
of over 300 same-sex twin pairs and their parents. The data set consists of one-on-one play interactions
between a parent with each twin separately, at each of three time points (ages 3, 4, and 5 years). This unique
sample allows investigation of how the parent's linguistic input to each child differs. Because half of the sample
consists of monozygotic (genetically identical) twins and the other half of dizygotic twins (sharing approximately
50% of their segregating genes), we can make inferences about genetic influences on traits by the degree of
similarity between members of a monozygotic and dizygotic twin pair. In this investigation we focus on how
genetically-influenced traits affect the properties of the parent's linguistic input. Quantitative genetic model-
fitting analyses will reveal bidirectional relations between parental linguistic input and child characteristics at
the level of etiology by informing about genetic and environmental influences on parental linguistic input at age
3, 4, and 5; stability and change in parental linguistic input across age; and sources of covariance between
parental linguistic input and child characteristics both within and across age. This is a timely investigation:
much attention is currently being given to the study of environmental or parental traits that affect linguistic
input, such as the parent's level of education, and how interventions might train parents within high-risk groups
to improve the quality of the input they provide. The proposed work adds another dimension to these efforts by
investigating child-specific features and how these may influence parental linguistic input above and beyond
environmental and parental traits. The knowledge gained will reveal how these child factors contribute to the
parental linguistic input children receive and the longitudinal consequences of this relationship."
10834940,"Mental health care for Veterans with suicidal symptoms is of paramount import to the VA. Unfortunately, VA
suicide reports show suicide rates increasing, suggesting a need for enhancing current VA suicide mental
health care efforts. While several psychotherapeutic treatments exist for acute suicidality, there is a deficit in
validated treatments designed to help Veterans following an acute suicidal episode (Post Acute Suicidal
Episode; PASE) such as following a non-fatal suicide attempt after acute risk declines but when they still have
ongoing mental health needs and, at times, chronic suicidal symptoms. Available suicide treatments are not
designed to promote the recovery and rehabilitation of PASE Veterans. This is a significant gap in
comprehensive suicide-focused mental health care. One avenue to close this gap lies through the
development of a recovery-oriented psychotherapy for PASE Veterans. Developing recovery-oriented care, “a
process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and
strive to reach their full potential” is a VA priority; however, available treatments for suicidal Veterans have
limited recovery-orientation. Decades of research into the development of suicide and processes of recovery
highlight the importance of increasing Veterans hopefulness about the future, developing a positive self-
identity, promoting Veterans’ sense of self-empowerment and improved relationships. Continuous Identity-
Cognitive Therapy (CI-CT) is a promising new manualized suicide intervention focused on improving Veterans
sense of their life story and personal future, with goals similar to recovery-oriented care. CI-CT was developed
by the applicant and, as a group therapy, piloted for suicide reduction in Veterans with SMI and was found to
have high levels of feasibility, acceptability and (in exploratory analyses) to lead to increased hopefulness
about the future and decreased suicidal symptoms. However, CI-CT needs further adaptation for use with
PASE Veterans and to enhance its alignment with the fundamentals of recovery-oriented care.
The proposed study has three primary stages:
First: develop an improved recovery-oriented version of the initial CI-CT Clinician Manual and Veteran
workbook to further address components identified as critical for PASE recovery using, (1) an ongoing
stakeholder study into the needs of PASE Veterans, (2) recovery literature, (3) scientific and Veteran consumer
advisory boards and (4) iterative feedback from an online Veteran PASE sample (N=25) on each section of the
workbook. This process will be guided by scientific and PASE Veteran Consumer advisory boards
Second: use the materials developed in phase 1 to run 3 one-arm treatment development trials (each with an
N of 4-6 PASE Veterans) to test and enhance the CI-CT treatment materials using Veteran feedback and
acceptability and feasibility data. Then, with the guidance of our scientific and Veteran consumer advisory
boards, use these results to update the treatment.
Third: conduct a pilot RCT (N=30) comparing CI-CT for PASE Veterans to an AC (health education) to assess
feasibility and acceptability of the treatment materials and research protocol including outcome measures
selected and assessment strategy. We will assess rates of recruitment, intervention engagement, and session
attendance (feasibility), Veteran satisfaction (acceptability), treatment adherence (fidelity) and preliminarily
explore response to CI-CT. Findings will be used to make a final adaptation of the treatment materials and to
develop a research protocol for a large scale RCT of CI-CT for PASE Veterans.
This study will develop and pilot test a well-specified, group-based intervention tailored to the unique needs of
PASE Veterans. The results of the proposed study will provide data to 1) identify adaptations needed to
optimize CI-CT for PASE Veterans: 2) identify possible benefits of CI-CT; 3) inform development of a large
scale RCT of CI-CT for PASE Veterans."
10834890,"Background: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide, with suicide
rates among U.S. military veterans doubling (27.7 per 100,000) the rate of civilian levels (14.7 per 100,000).
Despite a rise in prevention efforts, rates have continued to increase. Theories of suicide and rehabilitation
psychology stress the importance of the person-environment interaction in contributing to one’s disability
experience. Specifically, research has consistently found that the most frequent precipitant of suicide is a
problem with a romantic partner. Conversely, people with better relationship functioning are less likely to have
suicidal thoughts. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) identifies social
engagement and communication as important components of functioning. Prevention of suicide in at-risk
veterans is of vital importance and the quality of one’s intimate relationship is an understudied intervention
target for suicide prevention. This proposal refines and evaluates preliminary efficacy of the first couples-based
suicide-specific intervention—Treatment for Relationships and Safety Together (TR&ST).
Significance/Innovation: Suicide prevention is the top clinical priority for VA/DoD. The importance of including
family members in Veterans’ suicide-related care is a critical component of the National Strategy for Preventing
Veteran Suicides 2018-2028 and key finding from VA/DoD patient focus groups conducted for the 2019
VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Assessment and Management of Patients at Risk for Suicide.
Innovative aspects of this CDA-2 proposal directly address several components of national reports and include:
1) The first couples-based suicide-specific intervention and the first suicide-specific intervention to target
interpersonal functioning factors identified by suicide theories and rehabilitation psychology (i.e., effective
communication and interpersonal engagement); 2) Veteran-centric choice between home-based telemental
health and office-based care in order to increase access; and 3) Improved data analytic quality of Veteran
suicidality by examining both Veteran and partner reports of suicide related risk factors (the first suicide-
specific treatment study to do this).
Methodology: The proposed 5-year study consists of two phases. Phase 1: treatment refinement with 10
couples (N=20) and Phase 2: pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of TR&ST compared to VA Standard
Suicide Intervention with 60 couples (N=120). The intervention period is 13 weeks and the entire study period
is approximately 7 months. Couples in both phases will be quantitatively assessed at baseline, mid-treatment,
post-treatment, and 3-months post-treatment (and qualitatively interviewed following each TR&ST module).
The primary outcome to be evaluated is change in suicidal ideation severity. Secondary outcomes concern
changes in interpersonal functioning.
Aims: Aim 1 (Phase 1): Refine TR&ST in a population of Veterans with active suicidal ideation. Aim 2 (Phase
2): Evaluate treatment feasibility and acceptability of TR&ST. Aim 3 (Phase 2): Compare TR&ST vs. VA
Standard Suicide Intervention on suicidal ideation severity and interpersonal functioning (i.e., communication,
bonding, relationship satisfaction, and belonginess and burdensomeness) over 7 months.
Next Steps: This Career Development Award is the first step toward developing a vital program of research
within VHA focused on enhancing interpersonal functioning and suicide-related care by involving family
members in treatment. If Aims are achieved, future work includes 1) an adequately powered RCT of TR&ST
vs. VA Standard Suicide Intervention 2) a more direct evaluation of telehealth for couples-based or family
involvement in suicide-specific interventions, and 3) examination of moderators or groups of interest (such as
women Veterans)."
10848186,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Derivation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has revolutionized developmental biology and regenerative
medicine. To stably maintain PSCs in culture and guide them to differentiate with high efficiency and fidelity into
a variety of cell types, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms governing pluripotency (the ability
of a cell to generate any tissues in the body). Two phases of pluripotency, naïve and primed, have been defined
and studied in detail thanks to the successful derivation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast
stem cells (EpiSCs), respectively. Mouse ESCs most closely resemble epiblast from a 4-day-old mouse
blastocyst (~embryonic day 4, or E4), while “primed” EpiSCs display a global gene expression signature similar
to the E7 epiblast of a post-implantation mouse embryo. Despite these advances, however, however, there is
lack of a well-established PSC model that resembles E5-6 early post-implantation epiblast, which corresponds
to the formative phase of pluripotency. Formative pluripotency exists within a time window during which naïve
pluripotency is reconfigured to prepare for multilineage competency, including germ cells. Functionally, formative
pluripotency is characterized by both chimera competency and permissiveness for direct primordial germ cell
(PGC) induction. Several recent studies have attempted to define this state by transient epiblast-like cells
(EpiLCs) differentiated from ESCs. To date, however, stable formative PSCs have not yet been generated. By
modulating the FGF, TGF-β and WNT pathways, we recently derived PSCs from both mice and humans (referred
to as FTW-PSCs) that are permissive for direct PGC-like cell induction in vitro and are capable of contributing to
intra- or inter-species chimeras in vivo. FTW-PSCs harbor molecular, cellular and phenotypic features
characteristic of formative pluripotency. The overall objective of this proposal is to use these newly
established cell lines to comprehensively dissect the formative state across species. The proposed
studies will elucidate the roles of several transcription factors in regulating mouse and human formative
pluripotency, as well as demonstrate that FTW-PSCs are a robust platform for dissecting the molecular
mechanisms underlying human and mouse PGC specification. In addition, we will establish an in vitro platform
for the generation of functional mouse oocytes and human oogonia based on formative FTW-PSCs, thereby
providing an invaluable resource for studying germ cell development and human infertility. Our proposal has
tremendous potential to revolutionize regenerative medicine and reproductive biology."
10810807,"Aphasia is a language disorder that affects approximately two million Americans. The communication barriers associated with aphasia limit the ability to return to work and hobbies, worsen social relationships, and lead to social isolation. Social isolation is correlated with many negative health outcomes, including mortality. As a result, the consequences of aphasia can be wide reaching and severe. Group treatment has the potential to improve communication and reduce social isolation, while also reducing medical costs. However, this treatment format lacks a strong evidence base. This research uses a hypothesis-driven approach to test the efficacy of conversation treatment and develop and refine a mechanistic pathway of how conversation treatment leads to behavioral changes in communication ability. We will systematically explore whether the effects of treatment differ as a result of number of participants (large group or dyad), group composition (heterogenous versus homogenous profiles of aphasia), and severity of aphasia. The study will enroll a total of 168 participants with aphasia across three sites. In cycle one, 72 participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: dyad treatment, traditional group treatment or delayed control group. In cycles two and three, 48 participants with severe aphasia and 48 participants with mild-moderate aphasia will be randomly assigned to either large group or dyad conditions. In all cycles, treatment will occur for 60 minutes, twice per week for 10 weeks. During treatment sessions, a speech pathologist will facilitate discourse on a focused set of salient topics, such as current events, using individualized, linguistic and multimodal cueing hierarchies. The primary outcome measure is a functional measure of communication (Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure, ACOM; Hula et al., 2015). Secondary outcome measures will include standardized tests and patient reported outcome measures, and examine linguistic and functional communication abilities. All participants will be assessed pre-, post-, 4 weeks post- and 12 weeks post-treatment. The proposed research will address the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1 is to examine efficacy of conversation treatment delivered in dyads and large groups compared to a delayed-treatment control group. Specific Aim 2 is to determine optimal parameters for conversation treatment by testing whether the treatment effects differ as a function of aphasia severity (2A) or group composition (2B). Specific Aim 3 will test a hypothesized model of the pathway by which conversation treatment effects behavioral change. The results will provide further efficacy for conversation treatment and inform about the optimal parameters and outcomes of this intervention. This work takes a vital first step towards elucidating the mechanisms of change in conversation group treatment, with a long-term goal of ensuring access to cost-effective care for people with aphasia."
10809037,"ABSTRACT
Our ultimate goal to define the molecular mechanisms for EBV latency establishment and reactivation in the oral
cavity. In this proposal, we aim to characterize how EBV usurps B-cell maturation programs for cell survival and
the establishment of a continuum of cell states balancing latency-driven proliferation, differentiation, and lytic
reactivation. It is our central hypothesis that EBV establishes B-cell latent infection through mimicry of the
germinal center (GC) reaction and subsequently promotes a continuum of activation and differentiation that is
balanced to enable access to a cell state supporting lytic reactivation. We have formulated our central hypothesis
based on preliminary data including single-cell gene expression, chromatin conformation of tonsillar B cells and
EBV-immortalized cells as well as characterization of new spontaneously lytic strains of EBV. We found that
EBV latent infection promotes GC mimicry through temporal regulation of anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and BFL-1. Using
scRNA-seq of LCLs, we discovered a continuum of gene expression where NFB signaling/activation (e.g.
NFKB2, MYC, IRF8) is strongly anti-correlated with plasmablast differentiation (e.g. CD38, PRDM1, XBP1).
Furthermore, EBV lytic genes were expressed in cells most similar to the high differentiation state suggesting a
model whereby EBV-infected cells constantly sample this differentiated state to enable a switch to lytic
reactivation. Finally, using new strains of EBV we describe a paradigm of a persistent, spontaneous switch to
productive infection that is transient and reversible. Therefore, the rationale for this proposed research is that
understanding how EBV establishes latency and reactivates to productive infection provides insight into
therapeutic modalities to eliminate EBV-infected cells from the oral cavity. The underlying molecular circuitry
controlling these cell fate decisions may also provide important new information regarding the plasticity of B-cell
maturation states. We plan to test our central hypothesis and complete the objectives in this proposal through
the following three specific aims: i) to determine the molecular mechanisms by which EBV promotes B-cell
survival mimicking tonsillar B-cell maturation, ii) to define the underlying molecular circuitry supporting a novel
activation/differentiation continuum within individual EBV-immortalized B cells, and iii) to define the biochemical
and cell biological features of a newly described EBV recurrence phenotype in which latently infected cells
produce virions and return to their basal latent state."
10813877,"Abstract
 Currently, there is no known treatment to limit and/or protect the injured spinal cord from secondary
damage in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). More than 60% of SCIs occur at the cervical spine, resulting in
respiratory dysfunction, and quadriplegia, which is the paralysis of all four limbs, severely affecting patients'
quality of life. A therapeutic strategy that can reduce grey matter tissue loss could have dramatic and
meaningful functional outcomes for patients with cervical SCI. The overall objective of this proposal is to
examine and evaluate critical blood flow parameters that can reduce grey matter loss for improved functional
recovery after cervical SCI in a rodent model.
 Acutely after traumatic SCI, a complete loss of blood flow occurs at the injury center and is thought to
be a major contributor of the injury expansion during the secondary phase. Improving blood flow to the lesion
center and adjacent tissue has long been considered desirable to mitigate the loss of neural tissue. However,
until recently, there were no techniques available to monitor spinal cord blood flow in vivo in real-time.
Recently, we have developed a novel intravital ultrafast ultrasound imaging technique to visualize spinal
blood flow in real-time with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This new technology has created
a unique opportunity to evaluate local spinal hemodynamic changes in real-time. Recent work from our group
has shown that ultrafast ultrasound can 1) detect distinct areas of perfusion loss, in both the grey and white
matter 2) evaluate quality of peri-lesional blood flow, and 3) visualize patent spinal vessel morphology (down to
~ 50 micrometer) in a rat thoracic SCI model. Excitingly, we have now extended this work to include non-
invasive 3D image acquisitions, allowing us to monitor blood flow changes within the injured spinal cord
in 4D (3D imaging with time). In addition to the loss of blood flow at the lesion center, injury areas often
experience progressive hemorrhaging, resulting in an expanding hematoma. We hypothesize that reducing
the propagation of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and reducing elevated intraspinal pressure after SCI
can improve spinal tissue perfusion and mitigate secondary grey matter loss for improved functional
outcomes. Importantly, because there are known sex differences in cerebral blood flow and response to spinal
cord injury, we will examine the hemodynamic changes after cervical SCI in both males and females. By
applying this innovative ultrasound imaging, we aim to (1) discover critical perfusion thresholds for grey matter
tissue at risk, (2) monitor spatial and temporal development of the intraparenchymal hematoma, and (3)
evaluate treatment effects of reducing raised intraspinal pressure in real-time. Overall, these studies will
provide direct insights into the critical hemodynamic changes within the microcirculation of the spinal cord, as
well as effective ways of limiting secondary grey matter damage for improved functional recovery after SCI."

This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) application seeks support for
research training to augment the candidate’s knowledge and skills in co-occurring childhood trauma and opioid
use disorder (OUD) in order to support her progress to become an independent investigator. During the award,
the candidate will develop and implement a research program related to technology-based mindfulness
interventions and use of biomarkers to improve engagement in medication treatment for opioid-use disorder
(MOUD) in those who have experienced childhood trauma. The central hypothesis is that changes in autonomic
function and inflammation mediate the relationship between childhood trauma and poor treatment retention in
MOUD, and that mobile mindfulness training (mMT) is feasible in this population with potential benefits to
emotional, inflammatory, and autonomic function. This proposal includes training activities to ensure Dr.
Meadows achieves the following career goals: 1) Training in the discovery, interpretation, and assessment of
potential biomarkers to assess the link between childhood trauma and outcomes, 2) Advanced training in the
design and implementation of clinical interventions, and 3) Training in the analysis and interpretation of data.
The mentorship team includes experts in the following areas of research: substance use disorders (Drs. Rush
and Martin), intervention development (Dr. Rush), and advisors with expertise in the use of mobile mindfulness
training for substance use disorder (Dr. Reynolds), inflammatory biomarker evaluation (Dr. Moylan), heart rate
variability (Dr. Minassian), trauma treatment (Dr. Sprang), and advanced statistical modeling (Dr. McLouth). Dr.
Meadows will apply the skills from the training to test the three specific aims: 1) Demonstrate baseline differences
in autonomic function, inflammation, and treatment engagement between those with a history of childhood
trauma and those without childhood trauma or post-traumatic stress disorder enrolled in MOU, 2) Implement and
evaluate mMT in childhood trauma-exposed individuals enrolled in MOUD in order to a) demonstrate feasibility
and acceptability and b) estimate effect sizes for improvements in emotional health, autonomic function, and
inflammation, and 3) Assess whether mMT improves treatment engagement and retention in MOUD. The
proposed research is innovative because it will provide insight into the relationship between potential biomarkers
and treatment engagement in MOUD. It is also highly significant because it focuses on a mobile intervention that
can be readily adapted as an adjunct to existing treatment programs to improve outcomes. The research, training
plan, mentorship, and institutional support will facilitate Dr. Meadows’s transition to becoming an independent
physician-scientist to better serve the needs of individuals with co-occurring childhood trauma exposure and
substance use who are at the highest risk of treatment dropout and poor outcomes."
10783048,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this mentored career award is to establish my independent research career centered on
using community engagement strategies in implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in order to
improve service provision for vulnerable populations with substance use disorders (SU), specifically, parents
with SU involved in child welfare services (CWS). Parental SU is the primary reason for recent increases in
CWS cases, and parental SU is associated with worse outcomes, such as repeated child maltreatment;
however, engaging parents in SU services is challenging. Service provision requires collaboration across
multiple systems (CWS, treatment agencies) and multiple steps from initial identification of treatment need and
treatment referral to treatment engagement and eventual CWS case closure; as such, there are multiple points
where parents can fall out of care. The project proposes that poor outcomes for parents in CWS are due to (1)
challenges in effectively tracking care processes and identifying service gaps and (2) poor collaboration across
CWS and SU providers. Moreover, evidence-based practices (EBPs) that address service deficits exist, but
collaboration across systems and involvement from the community is needed for successful implementation.
The project seeks to improve SU service provision for parents in CWS through use of community
engagement and data-driven strategies in EBP adoption and implementation planning. The Research
Aims of the project include defining a SU care cascade for parents in CWS and calculating cascade outcomes
(e.g., rates of treatment completion, etc.) using administrative data (Aim 1); identifying facilitators and barriers
to cascade service provision through qualitative interviews with parents involved in CWS and CWS personnel,
SU providers, and community partners (Aim 2); and using Aim 1 and 2 data to identify an area of the cascade
to improve, select an appropriate EBP to address the need, and develop an implementation plan (Aim 3).
These aims will be will be carried out by a community alliance which will be established in Aim 1 and engaged
throughout the project. Proposed research activities include using community engagement strategies and
establishing a community alliance; conducting administrative, qualitative, and mixed methods analyses; and
using implementation mapping to develop an implementation plan. I have identified critical gaps in my training
and assembled a strong mentorship team to address these deficits through the following Training Goals: (1)
develop expertise in CWS and conducting research with CWS (Drs. Saldana, Wiehe); (2) become proficient in
use of administrative data (Dr. Monahan); (3) develop expertise in using community engagement strategies in
implementation (Drs. Wiehe, Aalsma, Saldana); and (4) gain advanced training in research ethics (Dr.
Aalsma). These training goals align with the proposed project and are necessary for my success as an
independent researcher. This project is the first step towards developing a larger research program that seeks
to improve services for parents involved in CWS and other vulnerable populations with SU."

This is an application for a K01 Mentored Research Scientific Development Award. The goal of the proposed
project is to provide the candidate with the advanced skills needed to establish an independent research program
examining the visual health needs of stroke survivors also living with dementia. To facilitate this long-term goal,
the candidate proposes a comprehensive training plan, combining formal coursework and meetings overseen
by her mentors, participation in applied training experiences and involvement in seminars and workshops.
Specific training goals include: (1) gain advanced knowledge in the epidemiology and mechanisms of post-stroke
dementia, (2) learn neuropsychological and clinical assessment of dementia, (3) acquire skills and training in
clinical research methodology and statistical analysis, using both cross sectional and longitudinal data and (4)
productively participate in career advancement and leadership development activities. The training plan will be
executed in coordination with the set of research activities mentioned above, which are based on preliminary
data collected by the applicant. The preliminary data show a lack of research on whether the presence of specific
types of vision impairment and ocular deficits increase the risk of post-stroke dementia.
The candidate will expand on these findings by using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities stroke
cohort to complete the following aims: (1) characterize the prevalence and outcomes associated with vision
impairment(s) among stroke survivors with and without dementia; (2) determine how pre-existing vision
impairments impact the development of dementia, among those with stroke; and (3) determine the effect and
downstream consequences of post-stroke vision impairment in persons without pre-existing vision impairment.
The primary hypotheses include that: (1) the odds of developing dementia are higher for stroke survivors with
pre-existing vision impairment, compared to stroke survivors with normal vision; (2) stroke survivors with vision
impairment preceding the stroke are more likely to develop dementia earlier, compared to stroke survivors with
normal vision; and (3) the impact of post-stroke vision impairment on dementia development is stronger for those
with functional impairment, compared to those without functional impairment. The expected findings will provide
critical insight into the types of vision impairment and ocular deficits experienced by people with post-stroke
dementia, including more information on the significance of distinguishing between pre- and post-stroke visual
impairments and the expected differential impact on dementia. Results from this research will be used to develop
a subsequent R01 research proposal that will facilitate the candidate’s transition into an independent researcher
focused on analysis of existent data and prospective enrollment to optimize the independence and community
participation of stroke survivors with vision impairments and dementia."
10834155,"The goal of this project is to leverage deep-learning algorithms on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to
improve the early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a malignancy with high mortality
and morbidity. Compared to other major types of cancer in the U.S. (e.g., colorectal, prostate, breast, lung),
PDAC has a uniquely high mortality with a 5-year survival of only 3%, largely due to the late stage of diagnosis
and the aggressiveness of the malignancy. In this K25 application, we aim to develop novel structured
methodologies for systematically incorporating human expert domain knowledge into the training procedure of
deep-learning algorithms (“Human-in-the-Loop” approach) for improving the early detection of PDAC. The
overarching hypothesis for this study, which has already been demonstrated in numerous other contexts, is
that the “Human-in-the-Loop” approach imbues the deep learning in the PDAC prediction model with expert
domain knowledge (e.g., clinical work-flows, statistical knowledge) to result in improved model performance as
well as interpretability of results.
 The proposed research will accomplish three aims. In Aim 1, we will build preprocessing pipelines that
are generalizable for analyzing multimodal data from different data collection systems (national, state, and
institutional). The resultant pipelines will provide multimodal EHR deep embeddings optimized for deep
learning applications in Aim 2 & 3. In Aim 2, we will investigate feature grouping strategies relying on
information from clinical workflows and incorporate them into the deep learning prediction model. The
proposed model will provide new clinical predictors represented by single or composite variables according to
the grouping strategies. Examples in the literature show that such grouped predictors consistently have
superior predictive power compared to their individual components. In Aim 3 we will study causal relationships
between patient variables (including composite variables discovered in Aim 2) and the PDAC risk. We will use
the Human-in-the-Loop approach where the possible causal relationships suggested from the deep learning
model will be evaluated and corrected by human experts (e.g., clinicians, statisticians), to construct faithful
Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs) visualizing causal pathways from patient variables to PDAC risk. The
resultant CBNs will be used as a framework for developing a risk assessment questionnaire to collect Patient-
Generated Health Data (PGHD), which will be further evaluated and optimized in my future R01 focused on the
development of a mobile survey application to efficiently collect PGHD and improve the early detection of
PDAC.
 This proposal can potentially lead to new criteria for identifying high-risk patients for PDAC and inform
targeted screening practices, that will likely be generalizable to other types of cancer."

SUMMARY: High endothelial venules (HEV) are specialized portals for lymphocyte entry into lymphoid tissues
and sites of chronic inflammation from the blood. Along with flat walled postcapillary venules, they regulate
immune cell trafficking in physiologic and pathologic settings including autoimmune diseases, inflammation and
cancer. HEV in lymph nodes draining sites of immune challenge expand dramatically to support enhanced
lymphocyte recruitment, with new high endothelial cells (HEC) arising by proliferation and by neogenesis from
capillary resident progenitors (CRP). The molecular pathways that control HEV expansion and differentiation
from capillary precursors are as yet unclear; but generation of a comprehensive atlas of lymph node blood
endothelial cell subsets, molecular phenotypes and responses to immune challenge now allows us to identify
candidate pathways involved. Our fundamental focus in this renewal application is therefore to identify and
characterize novel mechanisms of HEV specialization and generation in the immune response. In this context
we will mechanistically define pathways that i) regulate progenitor cell homeostasis and transitional EC
expansion in immune angiogenesis; ii) induce the unique ""high"" endothelial morphology and metabolism of
HEV, regulating ""HEVness"" and function; and iii) control the cell-fate decision that directs transitional EC
towards lymphocyte-recruiting HEV (vs non-HEV PCV) differentiation. We will apply innovative approaches to
address these fundamental gaps in knowledge including scRNAseq and mass proteomic EC profiling, novel
pan-EC and CRP-specific gene-targeted mice, and nanoparticle methods to manipulate EC-subset specific
gene expression. Elucidation of the mechanisms of endothelial cell specialization and homeostasis in lymphoid
tissues, including mechanisms regulating endothelial cells that control lymphocyte homing, will lead to novel
targets and approaches for the control of autoimmune inflammation and for therapeutic regulation of immune
cell traffic for vaccination and cancer immunity."
10813827,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The early life immune system requires “training” to decrease vulnerability to infectious diseases and is the time
period when risks for development of non-communicable, immune-mediated diseases, such as allergic diseases,
are established. Early life exposure to the farming environment has been shown to provide a protective role
against the development of allergic diseases. We have successfully established a novel birth cohort called
Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (WISC). WISC is a rural US birth cohort with infants from dairy farms, rural, non-
farming environments, and infants from Amish communities who have a very Traditional Agrarian (TA) lifestyle.
Our study findings demonstrate decreased incidence of atopic dermatitis, decreased viral respiratory illness
frequency and increased LPS-induced monocyte cytokine production during the first year of life in farm-exposed
infants. Our preliminary data demonstrate TA children have very low rates of allergic disease, unique gut and
nasal microbiota, and increased innate maturation and immune regulatory markers compared to farm and non-
farm children through age 2 years. There remain unresolved and important questions as to whether and how
innate immune cell competence and immunoregulatory function are related in early life and their risk for disease.
A major goal of this proposal is to define the immune and environmental signatures for protection from allergic
and viral respiratory diseases in farm exposed children and determine the relationship between immune, nasal
epithelial profiles and microbiome. Our central hypothesis is that farm-related microbial colonization
promotes the development of distinct immune and nasal epithelial phenotypes mediated, in part, through
epigenetic changes that reduce risk for allergic sensitization and increase mucosal antiviral responses.
We hypothesize the Amish will have distinct immune profiles and microbial exposures, the farm participants will
be intermediaries, and non-farm considered a relatively at-risk study group. To address this hypothesis, we will
continue WISC+ through age 5 years and establish a new cross-sectional cohort. Our study consists of three
aims and makes use of cutting-edge technologies that leverages our extensive experience with farm-related birth
cohorts and study team expertise. Aim 1. To characterize the longitudinal phenotypes and epigenetic trajectory
of monocyte and regulatory immune cells of the TA, farm and non-farm children through age 5 years. Aim 2. To
determine the relationship between TA and farm exposures, nasal airway epithelial cell gene expression and
response to naturally occurring viral respiratory illness. We will conduct an observational, cross-sectional, case-
control cohort study (called Microbial Associated Respiratory Illnesses, MARI) of three groups of school-age
children (100/group): TA children, suburban children without asthma, and suburban children with asthma to
examine nasal mucosal physiology, and viral respiratory illnesses. Aim 3. To identify differences in nasal airway
epithelial cell DNAm patterns in TA children, suburban children without asthma, and suburban children with
asthma that are associated with the frequency and severity of naturally occurring respiratory illnesses."
10813829,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The prevalence of allergic disease has risen drastically worldwide since the 1980s, disproportionately
affecting racial minority and young children. Allergic diseases, including asthma, are disorders of the immune
system, which is shaped by pre- and postnatal exposures, particularly by early life microbial exposures and
colonization in the developing infant. There is a critical need to understand the impact of microbial colonization
and their functional capacity in early life and the mechanisms by which they regulate the development of healthy
immune systems. Notable exceptions to the increasing prevalence of allergic diseases include children living
on dairy farms, and particularly Amish families, who follow a traditional agrarian (TA) lifestyle, as increased farm
exposures or diverse microbes, have been associated with protection against allergic disease.
We will test the overall hypothesis that gut and airway microbes and products influence local and distal
immunological responses that regulate respiratory allergy and infections. This project will analyze longitudinally
collected blood, stool and nasal samples from the TA, farm, and non-farm groups (WISC+, from Project I) to
identify differences in the functional capacity of the microbiomes of WISC+ children. To accomplish this goal, we
will perform metagenomic, meta-transcriptomic and metabolomics on longitudinal samples from the WISC+
study. We will then perform an integrative analysis of these data together with the gene expression and DNA
methylation (DNAm) data from Project I to identify relationships between the gut and airway microbiomes,
immune development and the expression of respiratory illnesses and allergic sensitization. Finally, we will
analyze data from the MARI study to identify microbial genes associated with the outcomes of natural respiratory
infections (Project I, Aim 2). We will assess group differences in the baseline nasal microbial genetics and
functional capacities of TA children vs. suburban children without asthma vs. suburban children with asthma
(MARI) and compare baseline microbial gene expression to host cell gene transcription, DNAm and the number
and severity of respiratory illnesses. These experiments in WISC+ and MARI will also provide a list of “select
microbes” that are increased in abundance in the farm and TA groups and have genetic features or predicted
metabolites linked to low rates of illness and allergic sensitization, which will be provided to investigators in
Project III. This will allow us to identify and select bacteria/metabolites based on their association with the
development of vigorous immune responses in farming environments. Information gained from the integration of
multi-omic data outlined in this proposal will lead to evidence-based selection of candidate bacteria for the next
generation of probiotics, secondary metabolites that can inhibit pathogenic bacteria or viruses, or modulate host
epithelial or immune cells to be used to boost naturally occurring resistance to respiratory infection and allergy
prevention. We are committed to learning from the naturally-acquired health benefits of TA and farm-related
exposures to inform the development of non-toxic, prophylactic treatments that could benefit all children."
10813835,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The early life environment modifies the risk for childhood allergic diseases, wheezing illnesses, and asthma,
and these diseases are less common in children who grow up on farms. Accordingly, in our studies of the
Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (""WISC,"" funded by the AADCRC program), reductions in atopic dermatitis and
respiratory illnesses were related to the intensity of farm exposures during the prenatal and early postnatal
periods. Notably, allergies and asthma are rare in children in traditional agrarian (TA) settings (e.g., Amish
communities) with intense farm exposures. Early life microbial exposures and colonization are likely to contribute
to health benefits by promoting epithelial cell function and immune development. Certain commensal microbes
such as Corynebacterium sp. and Dolosigranulum pigrum are inversely associated with bacterial respiratory
pathogens and reduce the risks of viral wheezing illnesses and exacerbations of childhood asthma.
 These findings suggest that airway microbiomes of TA and healthy farm children will be a rich source
of microbes that can inhibit viral and bacterial pathogens, increase epithelial integrity, and prime anti-
pathogen responses. To test this hypothesis, we have established in vitro models of cultured airway epithelial
cells to determine mechanisms for interactions between airway bacteria, viral infections, and epithelial cell
composition and function. Our preliminary data indicate that TA children have microbiome community structures
enriched for ""protective"" commensal bacteria with distinct genetic features. Finally, we used single-cell
transcriptomics to identify characteristics of airway epithelial cells that are highly susceptible to infection with
rhinoviruses (RV), which commonly cause wheezing illnesses during childhood.
 This project will test for interactions between airway commensal bacteria, airway pathogens, and epithelial
cells. First, we will screen commensal bacteria from healthy TA and farm children for metabolites that inhibit viral
and bacterial pathogens. Second, we will culture and analyze nasal airway epithelial cells from TA, farm, and
non-farm children to determine whether environmental exposures lead to group-related differences in cell
composition, antiviral responses, and synthesis of antimicrobial peptides. Finally, we will analyze effects of
selected bacterial metabolites from TA and farm children on cultured airway epithelial cells to determine whether
they exert beneficial effects on anti-pathogen responses and inhibit T2 inflammatory pathways.
 The results of these studies could lead to new therapeutic approaches to bring some of the health benefits
associated with farm exposures to all children."

Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) cause a significant portion of childhood croup, bronchiolitis and
pneumonia in the U.S. and worldwide, yet no effective drugs or vaccines are available. For the lethal Nipah
(NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses, in the face of human-to-human transmission of NiV, there is risk for global
spread as well as accidental or deliberate exposure. Despite the existence of antibody preparations for passive
immunoprophylaxis, there is no feasible approach to prevent or treat the human disease. These viruses serve
as prototypes for emerging paramyxoviruses. With this application we build on recent breakthroughs that have
led to a new broad-spectrum antiviral strategy based on inhibiting fusion during viral entry. We combine
structure-based optimization of fusion inhibitory lipopeptides, backbone modification via partial replacement of
α-amino acid residues with unnatural β-amino acid residues to enhance half-life, and addition of lipid
components to enhance antiviral efficacy. Using virologic, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments we will develop
powerful novel HPIV3/NiV/HeV fusion inhibitors that can be administered by inhalation. Validation of our
strategies with circulating respiratory viruses and clinical NiV virus strains in vitro and in vivo will lead us to
antiviral agents that are effective and practical in the clinical setting.
Aim 1. Targeting the paramyxovirus fusion complex: Evaluate entry inhibitor approaches in vitro.
We will develop fusion-inhibitory lipopeptides, combining conventional peptide design with backbone-
modification and membrane targeting to optimize broad fusion inhibition activity for NiV, HeV, HPIV, and
optimize potency, protease resistance, and tissue targeting of lead lipopeptides. We will evaluate antiviral
activity and potential for antiviral resistance in authentic ex vivo models. Human airway and brain models will
be employed to elicit resistant viruses in ex vivo evolution experiments, to study the molecular bases for
antiviral activity and potential for resistance to lead peptides.
Aim 2. Pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and efficacy of formulated lead antivirals in vivo.
We will assess the biodistribution and immunogenicity, acute toxicity, and PK/PD via nasal or inhalation
delivery of lead candidate series in small animal models, and evaluate efficacy of lead peptides for NiV/HeV in
golden hamsters and for HPIV in cotton rats. An efficacy study for the NiV lead will be conducted in African
green monkeys.

10634554,"Clinically Assessed Risk Factors for a Second ACL Injury Using an Innovative Wearable Sensor
Project Summary
Nearly 1 in 60 adolescent athletes will suffer ACL injuries. Approximately 90% of these injured athletes will
undergo an ACL reconstruction at an estimated annual cost of $3 billion. While reconstruction and subsequent
rehabilitation allow these athletes to return to sports, they have a 15-fold increased risk of sustaining a second
ACL injury, a tear of the ACL graft or the contralateral ACL, upon returning to sports. Many patients cleared to
return to sport by their physicians demonstrate residual muscle weakness, as well as asymmetrical movement
and loading patterns. Therefore, we contend that the underlying problem with current clinical return to sport
decision making is the lack of evidence-based load asymmetry evaluation methods that can be collected in a
clinical setting. Evidence about the clinical relevance of asymmetry has been collected in research-based
motion capture labs. It is not feasible to include costly and time intensive motion capture data collection in
clinical settings. Despite laboratory-based evidence that asymmetries (landing and muscle strength) increase
the risk of a second ACL injury, these measures are not able to be measured in clinical settings to determine
return to sport readiness. Our study has the potential to significantly impact post-ACL clinical care by identifying
the combination of traditional clinical and novel clinic-based return to sport measures that identify patients at
high risk for a second ACL injury and achieve our long-term goal of decreasing the number of ACL re-tears
through targeted interventions. Specifically, we propose to evaluate load asymmetry in the clinical setting using
a new load-sensing insole to determine the predictive associations of an innovative set of clinic-based functional
load symmetry measures. We will then develop a prognostic model from a comprehensive set of traditional
clinical measures (clinical characteristics and neuromuscular performance) and the proposed novel clinical
assessments (psychological/ behavioral readiness and functional load symmetry) to predict second ACL injury.
We will recruit 240 ACL reconstructed patients for model development and 120 ACL reconstructed patients for
external validation (14-25 years old) who have been released to return to sports. Clinician assessments, patient
self-reported data, and load asymmetry measures will be collected in a clinic-like setting. All patients will
complete injury surveillance for 18 months following return to sport (24 months following ACL reconstruction).
The goals of this observational study are to: 1) Determine whether functional load symmetry measures
significantly improve predictive accuracy for a second ACL injury over current standard of care clinical measures
used in return to sport decisions; and 2) Develop a prognostic model from a comprehensive set of traditional
clinical measures (clinical characteristics and neuromuscular performance) and novel clinical assessments
(psychological/ behavioral readiness and functional load symmetry) to predict second ACL injury. Study findings
will set the stage for future randomized multi-center studies to determine methods for decreasing the number of
second ACL injuries through targeted interventions."
10857188,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular ma-
trix. Myofibroblasts are the primary effector cells of lung fibrogenesis. Identifying molecular mechanisms medi-
ating myofibroblast differentiation will increase our understanding of IPF pathobiology and identify new targets
for antifibrotic therapies. Metabolic reprogramming is one such molecular mechanism essential, yet the con-
nections between metabolism, myofibroblast differentiation, and pulmonary fibrosis are unknown. Our objective
is to define how a new metabolic approach, lactate transporter (MCT) inhibition, prevents myofibroblast differ-
entiation in vitro and in vivo. Our preliminary data implicate lactate transport in IPF pathobiology by showing
increased expression of lactate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 in IPF lung explants. We show that inhibition of
these transporters decreases bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and myofibroblast differentiation. Lactate
transporter inhibition promotes cellular respiration and mitochondrial efficiency. Transcription factor enrichment
analyses suggest that MCT inhibitors reverse TGFβ-stimulated expression of pro-fibrotic BRD4 target genes.
Together, these data support our central hypothesis that lactate transport inhibition reprograms fibroblast me-
tabolism to attenuate ROS production and BRD4 activation, thereby preventing myofibroblast differentiation
and pulmonary fibrosis. To test this, we will pursue three specific aims: (1) Determine the metabolic conse-
quences of lactate transport inhibition, (2) Determine how lactate transport inhibition alters myofibroblast gene
transcription, and (3) Identify the cellular therapeutic target of lactate transport inhibitors in vivo. In Aim 1, we
will test that MCT inhibition promotes cellular respiration, decreases mitochondrial membrane potential, and
decreases fibrogenic ROS production using metabolic flux analyses, molecular biosensors, and novel meta-
bolic manipulations. In Aim 2, we will test that decreased BRD4 activity is the novel molecular mechanism link-
ing MCT inhibition and myofibroblast differentiation using a gain- and loss-of-function strategy applied to MCT
and BRD4 activity coupled to ChIP-qPCR analyses of BRD4 target gene engagement and myofibroblast phe-
notypic readouts. In Aim 3, we will test that MCT expression is essential for myofibroblast differentiation and
pulmonary fibrosis in vivo using MCT1 and MCT4 conditional knockout animals combined with imaging mass
spectrometry to interrogate fibroblast metabolism in vivo and scRNAseq to quantify fibroblast differentiation.
The rationale for this work is that defining mechanistic links between metabolism, myofibroblast differentiation,
and pulmonary fibrosis will advance the prospects of metabolic therapies for the treatment of IPF. The pro-
posed research is innovative because it focuses on the essential role of lactate transporters in myofibroblast
differentiation in IPF. The research contributions will be significant because they will establish the mechanistic
basis for the efficacy of lactate transporter inhibitors in pulmonary fibrosis."
10828776,"Sepsis remains a major cause of death worldwide (11 million sepsis-related deaths were reported in 2017),
and that costs associated with treating septic patients place a large burden on the healthcare industry. Sepsis
is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Early stages of
sepsis are marked by hyperinflammation driven by proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1β, IL-6, IFNγ, and TNF).
Patients who survive the acute phase of sepsis display long-term impairments in immune function. This state of
chronic immunoparalysis renders sepsis survivors increasingly susceptible to secondary infections.
Consequently, there is a desperate need to better understand the cellular and molecular basis of acute sepsis
pathophysiology and subsequent immune reprogramming that defines the prolonged immune suppression.
CD4 T cells, essential for coordinating the cellular and humoral immune response to a range of pathogens
under normal circumstances, are severely depleted during the acute stage of sepsis. The overall number of
CD4 T cells gradually recover over time, but their functional capacity remains blunted for many months. For the
past 10 years, we have focused our research to pursue the long-term goal of understanding how sepsis
impacts the CD4 T cell compartment because of the key role played by CD4 T cells in the overall fitness of the
immune system. We will continue our investigation of the cellular and molecular reprogramming of CD4 T cells
during sepsis in three interconnected areas of future research: 1) Define the mechanism(s) by which regulatory
CD4 T (Treg) cells expand during sepsis; 2) Perform an integrated discovery approach using genomics,
proteomics, and metabolomics to elucidate the molecular basis of sepsis pathophysiology and CD4 T cell
immunoparalysis; and 3) Determine how intestinal microbiota dysfunction during sepsis affects the magnitude
of the cytokine storm and promotes CD4 T cell immunoparalysis and increased incidence of late-onset
mortality. We will interrogate samples obtained from multiple cohorts of sepsis patients, as well as from
preclinical mouse models of sepsis at the level of Ag-specific CD4 T cell populations. Our preclinical studies
will be further strengthened by using a novel mouse model that mimics a critical aspect of human biology –
exposure to multiple ongoing and resolved infections trains the immune system for robust responses to new
pathogens – and will serve as an important and novel ‘transitional translational’ preclinical bridge between
humans and SPF laboratory mice to mechanistically study CD4 T cell dysfunction and reprogramming during
sepsis. Addressing these key gaps in knowledge regarding the effect of sepsis on CD4 T cell biology will likely
reveal new points of intervention that can be exploited in the future to restore CD4 T cell-mediated immunity,
and overall immune fitness, following sepsis."

Alcohol drinking and alcohol abuse during pregnancy is surprisingly high which can lead to a spectrum of
deficits in offspring termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. One of the most common consequences of
prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the emergence of anxiety disorders that are apparent in childhood and
persist through adulthood. Coincident and highly associated with anxiety is the prevalence of alcohol abuse in
individuals with PAE. Importantly, these observations are evident even following exposure to moderate levels
of ethanol – a common pattern of alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Despite compelling epidemiological data,
the neurobiological mechanisms underlying moderate PAE-induced anxiety are not well understood. The
actions of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) through its cognate receptor, CRF1R, are involved in alcohol
exposure-induced anxiety and alcohol preference in adult males, and their expression is altered by PAE in
anxiety-related brain structures. However, the developmental time-course of CRF1R function and how its
function is altered by PAE across ontogeny is unknown. We have recently characterized a model of moderate
PAE using a single exposure to vaporized ethanol on gestational day (G) 12, a developmental epoch during
which the amygdala begins to appear, that produces increased anxiety-like behaviors in adolescent male
offspring and affects emotional processing in adult males, with no apparent effects in females. Based on this,
we hypothesize that G12 PAE reduces CRF1R function through ontogeny, which contributes to the biphasic
anxiety phenotype and results in alterations in acute alcohol and CRF1R interactions. To test our hypothesis,
Aim 1 will determine the developmental time-course of CRF1R function within the central amygdala and its
relation to anxiety-like behaviors. Aim 2 will examine the impact of moderate G12 PAE on alterations to CRF1R
function within the central amygdala across development and into adulthood, as it contributes to PAE-induced
alterations in anxiety-like behavior. Finally, Aim 3 will test the effect of moderate G12 PAE on acute ethanol-
CRF1R interactions within the central amygdala and how CRF1R contribute to ethanol intake across ontogeny.
These innovative studies will test novel and unique hypotheses surrounding the long-term effects of moderate

10836425,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Infectious diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the expanding older population. While
vaccines are efficient measures to prevent infections, a critical problem is that aging-associated changes in the
immune system lead to decreased immunogenicity and clinical efficacy of most currently used vaccines. Novel
strategies that increase vaccination efficacy and specifically target the aged immune system are imperative. An
essential facet of these efforts is the use of combinatory adjuvants that synergistically potentiate more effective
vaccine-induced immune responses against various pathogens. In this project we will define the mechanism of
action (MOA) of a combination of a unique parasite protein adjuvant, rASP-1 with each of three well-
characterized innate adjuvants: STING, TLR7/8 and RIG-I agonists, known to activate cytoplasmic pattern
recognition receptors and Type I IFN signaling, which are specifically dampened in the aged population. We
have shown that rASP-1 is a powerful adjuvant as it activates human and mouse dendritic cells to potentiate
the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th1, Th17 and Tfh-like cells. Transcriptomic analyses of rASP-1-
activated hMoDCs revealed upregulation of the MyD88-independent activation pathway and interferon related
genes. In mice, rASP-1 elicits a balanced Th1/Th2 antibody response, Th1-biased cellular immunity, and
enhanced responses when co-administered with vaccines leading to increased survival following microbial
challenge. Importantly, our preliminary data indicate that rASP-1 in combination with 2’3’-cGAMP (STING),
R848 (TLR7/8) or 5’3p-hpRNA (RIG-I) in activated adult and aged mouse BMDCs can dramatically synergize
beyond merely additive effects; it enhanced secretion of IL-12p40, IP-10 and/or IL-10. The synergy is
exceptionally evident when it activates aged mouse BMDCs with the STING ligand. Therefore, we hypothesize
that combining rASP-1 with STING, TLR7/8 or RIG-I agonists will synergistically activate early innate immune
signaling that critically contributes to the establishment and nature of immune responses, and the duration and
intensity of immune activation. We posit that this will help restore the aging-associated deficits in the critical
regulatory pathways of the antiviral responses. Through comprehensive immunologic and transcriptomic
analyses, the MOA through which rASP-1 in combination with these three PRR agonists leads to optimal
activation of helper T cells driving humoral and cellular antiviral responses will be established in both mouse
(Aim 1) and human (Aim 2) DCs (adult and aged), to establish that they are conserved, and then test their
efficacy in vivo in adult and aged mice using the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) as a model
antigen (Aim 3). This project brings together a dynamic team with a history of collaboration and complementary
expertise in vaccinology, immunology, biochemistry, innate cell receptor biology, adjuvants, and bioinformatics.
We will deliver a novel, efficacious combination of innate cytoplasmic PRR adjuvants with rASP-1 that
promotes protective long-lived adaptive responses and boosts efficacy of vaccines in aged populations."

Approximately 38 million people worldwide are living with HIV. Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), 15-40% of
people with HIV (PWH) develop HIV-associated neurocognitive impairments (HIV-NCI). HIV enters the brain
early, often before people are aware of their HIV status or diagnosed. One mechanism for CNS infection is the
transmigration of HIV-infected intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes across the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
CD14+CD16+, or mature monocytes are increased in the blood of PWH, are the most susceptible to HIV infection,
and preferentially transmigrate across the BBB. This transmigration across the BBB contributes to the
establishment and reseeding of CNS viral reservoirs and chronic neuroinflammation that results in a neurotoxic
environment and neuronal injury that mediates HIV-NCI development. Therefore, characterizing mature
monocytes is critical to understanding the mechanisms by which they contribute to the pathogenesis of
inflammatory diseases in the presence of HIV, and to define ways to block their pathological effects. To
characterize functional properties of mature monocytes and the effects of HIV infection in these cells, we
previously performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of uninfected and HIV-infected mature
monocytes. This study showed that both populations separated into 9 monocyte clusters. Expression of genes
from molecular pathways involved in migratory, inflammatory, or neurotoxic functions in each cluster compared
to other clusters revealed two groups of monocyte clusters in both uninfected and HIV-infected cells, with
increased expression of most genes in these pathways in one cluster group (Group 1) compared to the other
(Group 2). Whether this difference in gene expression indicates increased transmigratory, inflammatory, and
neurotoxic properties of monocytes in clusters from Group 1 compared to those from Group 2 is unknown. We
hypothesize that uninfected and HIV-infected mature monocytes in Group 1 clusters express high levels of genes
in migratory and inflammatory functions, they preferentially transmigrate across the BBB to CCL2, and produce
more inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and ROS that contribute to HIV neuropathogenesis than Group 2
monocyte clusters. Aim 1: Characterize the transcriptome of Group 1 and Group 2 mature monocyte clusters to
identify mechanisms of their contributions to increased inflammation and BBB transmigration. We will validate
that group 1 clusters show increased median fluorescence intensity of proteins that correlate with genes
expressed in Group 1 monocyte clusters by flow cytometry, and confirm expression of these genes by qRT-PCR.
Aim 2: Characterize BBB transmigration and inflammatory properties of Group 1 compared to Group 2 mature
monocyte clusters. We will determine functional properties of Group 1 monocyte clusters by determining ROS,
cytokine, and chemokine production by flow cytometry, transmigration propensity with our in vitro BBB model,
and blocking antibodies targeting Group 1 proteins to see if transmigration is inhibited. scRNA-seq will also be
performed on transmigrated cells to better characterize and define Group 1 and Group 2 monocyte clusters."

While the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced the morbidity and mortality
associated with HIV infection, a cure is not achieved due to the persistence of latently-infected cells during
treatment. Accumulating data suggest that HIV-infected individuals often experience persistent immune
dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and accelerated aging even in the setting of ART-mediated viral
suppression. These realities have created a pronounced interest in developing strategies to cure HIV infection.
Identifying the host molecular determinants of HIV persistence and rebound kinetics following cessation of
antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be critical in developing effective strategies to cure HIV infection. We recently
applied a comprehensive systems profiling approach to plasma samples from HIV-infected individuals who
underwent analytical treatment interruption (ATI), to identify circulating host factors that enable prediction of
HIV rebound kinetics following ART interruption, and serve as potential pharmacological targets to promote
durable virologic remission in the absence of ART. The host factor exhibiting the strongest statistical
association with HIV rebound timing following ART cessation was circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in
plasma. Specifically, increased cfDNA abundance in plasma was associated with delayed time-to-rebound.
cfDNA, released into circulation during programmed cell death, has been exploited extensively in the realm of
clinical oncology (often termed “liquid biopsy”). However, cfDNA remains largely unexplored in the setting of
HIV infection. In this R01 proposal, we rigorously explore cfDNA as a biomarker of HIV disease states, and we
investigate the molecular and immunologic mechanisms linking cfDNA to viral expression and rebound.
Our central hypotheses are that 1) cfDNA reflects the death rate of HIV-infected cells in vivo; and 2)
cfDNA promotes an antiviral state in the host (e.g. induction of type I interferon response) which
prevents viral rebound. Our project features an investigative team with basic, translational, and clinical
expertise, and leverages large collections of clinical samples from well-characterized HIV-infected individuals.
In Aim 1, we will apply next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches to plasma samples from HIV-infected
individuals to extend and enhance the prognostic significance of cfDNA as a biomarker of natural HIV control in
vivo. In Aim 2, we will evaluate how the uptake and sensing of cfDNA by HIV target cells impacts cell fate and
the reactivation and replication of HIV. In Aim 3, we will determine how HIV-associated mitochondrial
dysfunction leads to cfDNA extrusion and ultimately induces type I interferon responses that prevent HIV
rebound. Our project will advance the development and evaluation of HIV cure strategies."

 Adaptive evolution is a fundamental process in biology. At its simplest random mutation produces
phenotypic variation on which selection acts, enriching for favorable phenotypes and purging the less-
favorable ones. This process has produced the diversity of life on Earth. Yet at the same time, adaptive
evolution is responsible for some of the most vexing problems in human health, from the growing problem
of antibiotic resistance to real-time evolution of viral pathogens to cancers that resist drug treatments and
evade the immune system. Despite this, we lack a basic mechanistic understanding of how genomes
respond to selection. One major unknown is how adaptive evolution “chooses” one particular path from
among a vast number of possible ones. Another major unknown is how genetic variation produces new
phenotypes on which selection acts. Experimental Evolution provides a way forward to address both of
these significant gaps in our knowledge. With advances in high-throughput biology we can evolve hundreds
of initially identical populations in parallel for thousands of generations, with exquisite control over
experimental parameters. This versatile technique makes it possible to test evolutionary theory through
experiments that are impossible to perform in natural populations. At the same time, experimental evolution
is powerful tool for functional genomics. By identifying the genes and pathways that respond to selective
pressures, and how these mutations interact to alter phenotype, laboratory evolution experiments identify
previously unknown cellular connections. In the past five years my laboratory has advanced a mechanistic
understanding of adaptive evolution. Future work will determine how genetic changes give rise to complex
phenotypes. We will perform evolution experiments following perturbation of the genetic background and
in shifting environments. In addition to advancing our understanding of adaptive evolution, we expect,
based on our prior work, to identify previously unknown nuclear-nuclear, nuclear-cytoplasmic, and gene-
environment interactions. Finally, we will develop a fast and reliable method for performing multiple rounds
of pooled gene editing in yeast, and we will use this method to systematically assay genetic interactions
that have been missed by other methods. By connecting genotype to phenotype in an evolutionary context,
our work will provide a mechanistic understanding of how complex traits evolve. This work will advance
our understanding of adaptive evolution and the genetic basis of complex traits in less tractable systems,
including humans and human pathogens."

Our research program is directed towards innovating and advancing optical tools for the visualization and
quantification of latent biomolecular processes across multiple levels of biological organization. The MIRA
project will support and improve our analytical toolkit, which spans from surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopic (SERS)-based molecular imaging probes to self-actuating single-cell analysis platforms and
biomimetic structures for cellular mechanotyping. Crucially, with support from the MIRA proposal, we will
develop three new, complementary platforms to address pressing questions in multiplexed molecular analysis,
intracellular magnetic sensing, and targeted imaging of cells and tissues.
First, we plan to realize a novel Raman spectroscopic sensing method by fusing SERS with coherent vibro-
polariton interactions in the strong coupling regime. While highly desirable, achieving vibrational strong
coupling (VSC) between ground-state molecular vibrations and an optical cavity has remained elusive.
Combining SERS nanoprobes with rationally designed Fabry-Perot cavities, we present a practical scheme to
render VSC that would simultaneously enhance the strength of Raman scattering and enrich its spectral
features paving the way for ultrasensitive and highly multiplexed analyte detection.
Second, we aim to develop an ultrasensitive nanoscale magnetometer to probe spin effects in biomolecules,
an important but poorly understood quantum effect in biological systems. We will implement a DNA-assisted
self-assembly approach to pair nitrogen vacancy-center in nanodiamond (NVnD) with plasmonic nanocavities.
The accompanying enhancements in NVnD sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution will permit the detection
of currently undetectable ion flux-induced weak magnetic fields (WMF) and to examine the role of WMF in
affecting the spin dynamics of cryptochrome-generated radical pairs.
Third, we seek to harness biocompatible click condensation reactions to create a new class of synthetic
peptide-based Raman imaging nanoprobes involving enzyme-regulated intracellular self-assembly. Our
nanoprobes offer multiple advantages for targeted cellular imaging: higher accumulation and reduced efflux
due to in situ probe assembly; high sensitivity due to the presence of repetitive units of a π-conjugated
functional group in a single structure; and exquisite specificity owing to the easily distinguishable vibrational
mode in the cell silent spectral region."
10804700,"Project Summary: This MIRA proposal will combine work from our longstanding projects on the structure and
function of adhesion G protein coupled receptors (or Family B2 GPCRs) and the molecular chaperones for G
protein alpha subunits, Ric-8 proteins. Adhesion GPCRs are a large, 33-member family of receptors that
transduce signals from cell to cell or cell to extracellular matrix adhesion events across the cell membrane to
awaiting G proteins in order to elicit responses within the cell. Our work has advanced a mechanism for adhesion
GPCR activation in which the extracellular adhesion domains become anchored to protein ligands and the cell
that contains the GPCR or seven transmembrane domain (7TM) moves, by any number of means, in relation to
this fixed anchor to dissociate the two halves of the adhesion GPCR. This dissociation event reveals a previously
hidden tethered agonist of the GPCR/7TM domain that self-activates the receptor. This mode of activation
seems common to most members of the adhesion GPCR family, but alternative modes of adhesion GPCR
activation have also come to the fore of the field. Our goal in this proposal is to expand upon our mechanistic
and structural work to decipher varied adhesion GPCR activation modes using biochemical, cell biological, and
in vivo approaches, including work with two mouse models newly created for this proposal. We will focus on
adhesion GPCRs that are present in cells that circulate in the blood, for example ADGRG1/GPR56 on platelets,
as well as additional ADGRG subfamily members present on other circulating cell types. Circulating cells offer
an advantage for interrogating adhesion GPCR action because the shear force component that dissociates the
two fragments of the receptors, for the purpose of tethered-agonist-activation, is readily tractable. The sum of
our work will be to distinguish tethered agonist -dependent and -independent modes of adhesion GPCR
activation, which we argue is perhaps the most important contemporary question in the adhesion GPCR field.
In parallel, we have assigned the function of Ric-8A and Ric-8B proteins as molecular chaperones that are
required to collectively fold all G protein alpha subunits. This is a mature project for our lab, yet we have made
recent breakthroughs in solving the structures of Ric-8/G protein guanine nucleotide-free complexes. We
present preliminary evidence of a new Ric-8/G protein complex structure that will enable us to finally tackle a
major outstanding question; What are the structural elements of mammalian Ric-8A and Ric-8B that define their
specificities for different G protein subtypes? Combined with analysis of the single copy of an ancestral Ric-8
(Drosophila Ric-8) that seemingly crosses the lines and appears to fold all G protein subtypes, our work will
provide new understanding of the substrate specificity rules, thereby providing a rationale for potentially targeting
the Ric-8 chaperone system in contexts of G protein-driven disease."
10854753,"Chromosome segregation during sexual reproduction places one chromosome, either the maternal or paternal
copy, in each gamete. Accurate meiotic chromosome segregation requires that the parental chromosomes
interact with one another and exchange genetic information through the formation of crossovers. Mis-regulated
chromosomal interactions could lead to karyotype rearrangement and chromosomal mis-segregation, and
consequently to infertility and congenital birth defects. Indeed, crossover formation is tightly regulated on both
local and chromosome-wide scales. The research proposed here addresses the mechanisms regulating
chromosomal interactions by using nematodes and budding yeast, and by developing new experimental
approaches suited to study chromosomal processes that are regulated on large scales.
This proposal probes two aspects of chromosome organization and dynamics. The first part addresses the role
of the synaptonemal complex, a conserved interface that assembles between the parental chromosomes and
regulates the distribution of crossovers. This work builds on the recent understanding that the synaptonemal
complex, despite its ordered appearance when visualized by electron microscopy, is a liquid-like compartment.
By applying genetic approaches, evolutionary analysis, single-molecule tracking and cutting-edge microscopy,
the research aims to understand how the ultrastructure and liquid properties of the synaptonemal complex allow
it to assemble onto the parental chromosomes and regulate crossovers on a large scale. Specifically, how do
protein-protein interactions and the conserved coiled-coil domains in synaptonemal complex proteins generate
an ordered, 3-dimensional structure that nonetheless has liquid properties such as constant subunit exchange?
And, what is the molecular mechanism that regulates loading of a liquid-crystalline synaptonemal complex onto
meiotic chromosomes, aligning all of them from end to end?
The second part addresses the organization of the parental chromosomes and the sister chromatids during
sexual reproduction. These large bundles of chromatin form distinct cytological entities that can nonetheless
undergo precise exchange of information – a necessary step to successfully pass genomes from one generation
to the next. An approach developed in the lab to label only one of the two identical sister chromatids will allow
probing of the differentiation of the sisters from one another. This is important, since formation of crossovers –
which exchange information between the parental chromosomes – involves regulated avoidance the sister
chromatid. The lab is also developing a novel approach to obtain a single-molecule, high-resolution description
of chromosome conformation and dynamics by utilizing an emerging technology to sequence very long
molecules of DNA. Applying this approach to chromosomes during sexual reproduction – when chromosomes
are organized as an array of chromatin loops – will shed light on the mechanisms that align the parental
chromosomes, keeping them in register and allowing them to accurately exchange information."

Cognitive decline is the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and biomarkers to measure amyloid beta (Aβ) or
tau burden are increasingly being used to identify early (pre-clinical) AD risk prior to emergence of cognitive
impairment. Disturbances of sleep are common in AD, mild cognitive impairment and also in normal elderly with
Aβ positive biomarkers. This suggests that: i) disturbed sleep contributes to AD-neurodegeneration (i.e. sleep
disturbances such as from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are modifiable risk factors for AD); or, ii) sleep is
particularly sensitive to Aβ and neurofibrillary tangle pathology (i.e. sleep disturbance is an early biomarker of
AD), impacting quality of life. Our published data show that increased OSA severity in cognitively normal older
subjects is associated with increased Aβ burden. Our preliminary data also show that OSA is associated with
elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau, a finding that may have a stronger link to cognitive decline. We have
recently confirmed an increased prevalence (75%) of new-onset OSA in World Trade Center (WTC) dust-
exposed subjects (i.e. responders) compared to the general population. The WTC responder cohort is aging and
there is evidence of early cognitive impairment and high incidence of cognitive decline compared to age matched
norms. This cohort is unique for its high prevalence of OSA, the availability of longitudinal data on presence and
duration of OSA as well as information on other relevant risk factors for AD such as depression and post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the relationship between sleep
disruption, biomarkers for AD risk and cognition. The purpose of the present proposal is to examine the impact
of OSA severity and sleep related changes on AD plasma biomarkers, tau burden and cognition in WTC subjects
using novel methodology and adjusting for potential confounders. Aim 1 will examine longitudinal changes in
plasma tau and tau burden in 64 subjects with and without OSA to test the hypothesis that OSA severity is
correlated with (i) changes in plasma tau and (ii) with greater longitudinal tau burden using PET-MR imaging
using 18F-PI2620. Aim 2 will examine the relationship between OSA and cognition using a visual-spatial memory
test (3D-maze) and the subtle cognitive impairment test (SCIT); both tests are sensitive to sleep disruption in
subjects who are cognitively normal or minimally impaired by standard neuropsychological testing. We will test
the hypothesis that OSA severity at baseline predicts longitudinal decline in spatial navigational memory and
SCIT. Demonstration of a relationship between OSA, AD biomarkers and cognitive impairment suggests specific
risk factors for AD might be assessed non-invasively (e.g. by maze/SCIT or by finding OSA or sleep specific
biomarkers). These data will guide future interventional studies targeting sleep disruption (e.g. treatment of
OSA, increase sleep duration) and outcomes (e.g. improvement in cognition) with the long-term goal of improving
the quality of life and health outcomes in the WTC responder cohort."
10848176,"When the World Trade Center was attacked on September 11, 2001, approximately 25,000 children were living
or attending school in lower Manhattan, tens of thousands of other children were in the path of the plume. As we
approach the 20th anniversary, it becomes clear that while we have thoroughly studied those exposed on 9/11
as adults, we did not adequately study those children, whose development was interrupted by 9/11. Those
children are now in their early to mid-adulthood and many will carry the effects of 9/11 for a lifetime. There is,
thus, a clear imperative to thoroughly understand the enduring impact of that exposure on all aspects of their
lives now and going forward. Fortunately, our team, The Global Psychiatric Epidemiology Group at Columbia
University, was funded by NIOSH to recruit a representative sample (N=xx) of 9/11 directly exposed youth who
were ages 0-17 on 9/11, as well as an unexposed control group. We have followed them through two waves of
in-depth physical and psychological assessments. This cohort now constitutes the best available opportunity to
understand the intricacies of the impact of 9/11 on adults who were exposed as children. In this study we propose
to study the impact of childhood trauma on the central challenges, roles and relationships of entering and
occupying adulthood, in addition to continuing the study’s collection of vital longitudinal information.
We have this important opportunity now to compare those exposed with controls, which will enable us to examine
how trauma affects intimacy and family formation, education and career consolidation, moral development and
civic engagement, and the challenge of parenting, with a traumatic history. It represents a unique opportunity to
add to our understanding about the nature of their unfolding adulthood, psychologically and physically. We will
conduct another wave of in-depth assessments of psychological and physical health including pulmonary health
and related parameters, and we will collect and biobank blood for a second time to allow for the future
examination of inflammatory and epigenetic biologicals. As the long-term consequences of 9/11 direct exposure
now inevitably includes these individuals’ experience with COVID-19, so this study will also evaluate the effects
of an additional mass trauma on these emerging adults. In sum, this study will encourage new ways of thinking
about trauma, development from childhood to mid-life, health promotion, and even parenting support of those
traumatized as children."

The long-term goal of this project is to advance precision medicine by developing a simple, rapid, and
comprehensive approach to molecular diagnostic testing that can be easily performed on any cancer subtype.
In lung adenocarcinoma and many other solid tumor types, optimal treatment relies on the identification of
specific genomic alterations. These include single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions, as well
as larger copy number alterations and chromosomal translocations. Currently, clinical testing for these mutations
requires multiple assays and significant amounts of tissue so that both DNA and RNA can be obtained for
analysis. As a result, many samples fail or simply cannot be tested. At our cancer center 38% of lung cancer
patient biopsies sent for comprehensive molecular evaluation either fail or result in incomplete results. More
robust and streamlined diagnostic methods are therefore needed to provide truly comprehensive mutational
profiling for all cancer patients. We have developed a novel approach for whole-genome sequencing
(ChromoSeq) that provides rapid, unbiased evaluation of all mutation types in a single assay. ChromoSeq
leverages recent advances in high-throughput sequencing methods to deliver a complete genomic profile in as
little as 3 days using minimal DNA input. We have previously shown that ChromoSeq can provide rapid
comprehensive genomic profiles from blood or marrow of patients with myeloid malignancies and that
ChromoSeq has increased sensitivity to detect clinically significant genomic alterations compared to
conventional methods. However, obtaining similar performance from solid tumors with limited amounts of
degraded DNA typically obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue biopsies is challenging.
We hypothesize that with substantial methodologic pre-analytic improvements and rigorous clinical validation
testing, ChromoSeq can also be used for the comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors. In this application,
we propose to measure and optimize DNA changes that occur during pre-analytic tissue processing of routine
clinical biopsies (Aim 1) and then establish the clinical performance of the assay using retrospectively and
prospectively collected patient samples (Aim 2). These Aims will be performed in a CLIA-licensed, CAP-
accredited laboratory with the overall objective of producing a CLIA-compliant assay for future use in clinical
studies and to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with lung cancer. Tools and protocols developed
in this application will enable other laboratories to benefit from this simplified approach to cancer genomic
profiling."

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an evolutionary conserved Ser/Thr kinase that senses multiple
upstream stimuli to regulate cell growth, metabolism, and autophagy. mTOR is the catalytic component of a
multi-protein complex called mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Elevated mTORC1 activation is common in multiple
human disease including cancer, type 2 diabetes, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration. Small molecules
like rapamycin that target and inhibit mTORC1 are used in the clinic with limited success. Thus, deciphering the
molecular mechanisms by which mTORC1 is regulated is crucial to treat mTORC1-mediated disease. The
overall objective of this proposal is to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which mTORC1 is regulated by
upstream stimuli. Specifically, this proposal is focused on mTORC1 regulation by amino acids and G-protein
coupled receptors (GPCRs). We anticipate that the studies in this proposal will yield new insights into mTORC1
regulation by upstream stimuli and will uncover novel therapeutic targets to perturb mTORC1-mediated disease."

Alcohol use disorders are a major public health concern afflicting approximately 17 million Americans, often
beginning with binge drinking during adolescence. In recent years drinking in adolescent females has surpassed
that of adolescent males. However, the sex-specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying the impact of
adolescent binge drinking are not well understood. We have previously shown sex-specific changes in behavioral
and brain protein changes following adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure. In the proposed work, we
focus on sex steroid regulation of neuronal activation with a particular emphasis on the medial prefrontal cortex.
Sex steroids are critically important for pubertal hormonal function and is altered by early alcohol exposure.
Specifically, we examine the long-lasting sex-specific changes induced by AIE exposure with withdrawal in male
and female mice. If binge alcohol exposure changes normal adolescent brain development, alterations in
neuronal activation in sex steroid containing neurons likely plays an important role in the lasting effects of
adolescent binge alcohol exposure and increased susceptibility to development of an alcohol use disorder. Aim
1 will determine (1) sex-specific and time-dependent changes in neuronal activation and steroid receptors in
mesocorticolimbic brain structures after withdrawal from AIE and ethanol re-exposure. Aim 2 will determine sex-
specific and time-dependent changes in metabolomic and sex steroid profiles after withdrawal from AIE and
ethanol re-exposure. Aim 3 will determine if activation/inhibition of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) after AIE
exposure impacts subsequent ethanol drinking. Completion of this work will elucidate short- and long-term
impacts of adolescent ethanol exposure on neuronal activity in steroid receptor containing neurons in
mesocorticolimbic regions, metabolic and sex steroid profiles, and prefrontal regulation of subsequent ethanol
drinking behavior."
10857159,"The MARC at Maryland is a three-year bioengineering undergraduate research training program that will break
down research barriers for students traditionally underrepresented in STEM by exposing them to research
opportunities and their benefits, facilitating positive interactions with research faculty, and enhancing financial
literacy. The number of underrepresented graduate trainees in biomedical sciences, particularly bioengineering,
still fall well below what would be representative of the current US population. The three key objectives of this
MARC program are to 1) increase the number of students from groups underrepresented in STEM that pursue
biomedical, research-focused higher degree programs (Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D.), 2) support trainees in overcoming
barriers to entering research and preparing them for research careers, and 3) develop faculty mentors who will
enhance research pool diversity throughout their careers by training them in best practices in mentoring diverse
researchers. Our MARC program seeks to complete these objectives by integrating research training, mentor
training, peer mentoring, and financial literacy all while building a community for trainees that will provide them
with support in their biomedical research careers. MARC trainees will rotate through two mentor labs during their
first semester in the program and will be matched to work in mentor labs for the remaining 5 semesters until
graduation. MARC faculty and graduate mentors working with MARC trainees will be fully trained through the
“Entering Mentoring” and “Culturally Aware Mentoring” programs developed through rigorous peer-reviewed
methods by the Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research (CIMER), to ensure an
inclusive environment. Our program also includes a one-credit course that integrates best practices in active-
learning-based teaching and will feature a “flipped” style of research training consisting of a comprehensive set
of research training workshops/lectures followed by in-class activities on classic topics including research training
(e.g. rigor, making figures, scientific communication) and career development (e.g. guidance on
fellowship/internship/graduate school applications). In addition, we aim to build a community for students through
semi-formalized peer mentoring, weekly activities such as Lunch and Learn and study halls, and annual program
retreats. Uniquely, we have partnered with Moore Wealth to integrate a 5-pillar financial literacy program into our
1-credit class. This is particularly important, as Black or African American students graduate college with on
average $4000 more debt than white students and underrepresented students often face additional financial
pressures. Moore Wealth’s financial literacy program is developed by and for students of color and includes
topics such as credits and loans, investing, and navigating career transitions from the financial perspective.
Altogether, we propose a comprehensive program that provides support to trainees from underrepresented
groups in research training and beyond with the main aim to increase representation in bioengineering at the
graduate level."

Frontline treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD), including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), have
limited effectiveness, with ~½ of patients not responding to CBT and ½ relapsing within 2 years. Strategies that
could increase the potency of MDD treatments are needed. We have previously shown large psychological and
neuroplasticity improvements for 75 minutes post-exercise in adults with MDD. This creates a neurologically
fertile post-exercise window with the potential to maximize the effects of CBT performed immediately after
exercise. We have developed a novel treatment strategy using aerobic exercise to prime a subsequent CBT
session (‘ActiveCBT’). Exercise priming is hypothesized to lead to greater engagement of CBT mechanisms of
action through both common (e.g., working alliance) and specific (e.g., behavioral activation) factors linked to
depression outcomes; this CBT augmentation approach has yet to be empirically tested. Our published and
preliminary work show exercise acutely improves psychological (eg, state anhedonia) and neuroplastic (eg,
BDNF) markers in MDD, and our n=10 pilot feasibility trial of this project indicates high likelihood for logistical
success and plausible effects of exercise priming on target mechanisms. The R61 will consist of an 8-week
randomized controlled trial in 40 adults with MDD performing 30-minutes of moderate exercise or quiet rest
(ActiveCBT vs. CalmCBT) prior to weekly CBT sessions. Using a time- and attention-matched control, all
participants will view a standardized documentary series for these 30 pre-therapy minutes with the only
difference between groups being exercise. This project will also employ cutting-edge, machine learning and
natural language processing via the Lyssn platform to objectively evaluate therapy. The overall R61 goals are
to: 1) demonstrate exercise priming effects on target CBT mechanisms (working alliance and behavioral
activation), 2) link psychological and neuroplastic exercise priming to CBT mechanisms, and 3) explore
sensitivity of objective machine learning-based markers from Lyssn to ActiveCBT-induced therapy differences.
Upon identification of a moderate between-group difference in working alliance and/or behavioral activation
favoring ActiveCBT, the R33 will proceed with a 2:1 randomized, controlled trial (n=100), comparing ActiveCBT
to CalmCBT. The overall R33 goals are to: 1) confirm effects of exercise priming on target CBT mechanisms,
and 2) determine the preliminary efficacy signal of exercise priming, and determine the strength of the efficacy
link with CBT mechanisms. Our working hypotheses are that we will confirm higher working alliance and/or
behavioral activation in ActiveCBT, with greater depression effects at 8 weeks and 12 weeks later linked to
greater working alliance and/or behavioral activation. These trials will establish the potential for a subsequent
confirmatory efficacy trial to rigorously test the potential of exercise priming to enhance treatment. If this
innovative, biologically-informed approach successfully ‘primes’ subsequent therapy, this could be used to
augment other treatments and in other disorders, significantly improving mental health treatment."

Metabolic disorders (i.e. obesity, prediabetes or type 2 diabetes), often resulting from poor diet, is a significant
risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Several common neurodegenerative mechanisms in these two
conditions have been identified, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation.
Changes in metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics may be at the heart of both metabolic disorders and
AD but may be affecting men and women differently. Although AD treatments exist, none are very effective,
and certainly no drugs are sex-specific, creating a significant unmet medical need. Interestingly, several clinical
trials testing nilotinib, a repurposed leukemia drug, have shown promise for use in treating AD and other
neurodegenerative diseases. In addition to attenuating hallmark pathology, we recently demonstrated that
nilotinib improves mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in cultured cells from the 3xTg-AD mouse model for
AD. In this study, our specific objective is to use a high fat diet (HFD) to model metabolic disease in 3xTg-AD
mice and evaluate sex-differences associated with bioenergetic, cognitive, and neuropathological outcomes,
as well as whether nilotinib can improve them. The rationale for the proposed work is further supported by a
recent phase II study conducted by our collaborator, Dr. Scott Turner, that showed 12 months of treatment with
nilotinib, at 150 mg/day for 26 weeks followed by 300 mg/day for 26 weeks was safe, tolerable, and effective in
patients with mild to moderate AD. Here, we hypothesize that nilotinib will improve mitochondrial bioenergetics,
enhance cognitive function, and reduce biomarkers of AD pathology in a sex-dependent manner in 3xTg-AD
mice subjected to a HFD. In Aim 1, we will determine whether in vivo treatment (100 or 250 mg/kg for 2
months) with nilotinib improves mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in 3xTg-AD mice in the absence and
presence of HFD-induced metabolic disease. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether in vivo treatment with
nilotinib can reverse cognitive-behavioral deficits in 3xTg-AD mice in the absence and presence of metabolic
disease. Finally, in Aim 3, we will characterize the effects of in vivo treatment with nilotinib on AD-associated
neuropathology in 3xTg-AD mice in the absence and presence of metabolic disease. The mechanisms by
which nilotinib may improve outcomes in vivo, as well as patient populations for whom nilotinib treatment may
be safe and effective (i.e., based on sex and comorbid metabolic disease, present in 80% of AD patients),
have yet to be adequately explored in rodent models prior to the commencement of the drug’s phase III trial.
We expect that a HFD will result in a wider range of bioenergetic, cognitive, and neuropathological
consequences in female AD mice as compared to males. Overall, we expect nilotinib will improve
mitochondrial function, ATP levels, AD-associated neuropathology, and cognition in 3xTg AD mice, including
those subjected to a HFD."

 Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Chagas disease (CD) are neglected tropical diseases
(NTDs). Current drugs show increasing numbers of treatment failure, low efficacy, difficult treatment regimens
or severe side effects. In a unique industrial-academic collaboration, the PIs, in collaboration with GSK, ran a
high-throughput screen (HTS) of ~46,000 kinase-targeted inhibitors against Trypanosoma brucei, the causative
agent of HAT. This resulted in the discovery of 797 potent (T brucei EC50<1 μM; pEC50 6) and selective hits
(>100-fold over HepG2 cells) that were sorted into 59 structural clusters, plus 53 singletons. 14 chemotypes
including 13 clusters and 1 singleton have been explored for their structure-activity and structure-property
relationships. A “parasite-hopping” approach has identified six of these with interesting activity against T cruzi
(CD).
 This competitive renewal outlines a hit-to-lead medicinal chemistry program that will continue to optimize
high-priority hit clusters from the original HTS. These have been identified through re-analysis of the original
HTS data to place an emphasis on compounds that are cidal and predicted to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
which is essential to treat stage 2 of HAT. Additionally, we will employ computer-aided drug discovery to further
explore those chemotypes for which we have identified a putative target. We will also perform hit-to-lead
medicinal chemistry optimization on the six chemotypes that have been identified as of interest for T cruzi. We
will also look for synergistic effects between clusters that have complementary activity profiles (e.g. slow acting,
cidal in nature, and fast acting, static in nature) and in combination with standard trypanocidal drugs.
 Optimization will result in the delivery of high-quality lead compounds from each of these chemical
classes, and the lead compounds will meet stringent profiles of cellular potency and selectivity, BBB permeability,
physicochemical and metabolic properties, and pharmacokinetic properties in mice depending on the disease
targeted. Furthermore, these lead series will display in vivo efficacy in the murine models of disease.
The optimization program will be performed under the continuing collaboration between NEU and CSIC, with
critical contributions of expertise in drug metabolism and physicochemical properties experiments from
AstraZeneca and UCSD. We have developed and implemented a testing funnel that ensures that the
optimization process will address the most critical lead criteria. Finally, we will perform the target identification
and mode of action studies by different approaches including chemical proteomics, induction of resistance and
whole genome sequencing and metabolic fingerprinting.
 This project will deliver (a) multiple lead compounds for HAT and CD that meet well-defined Lead Criteria;
(b) broader profiling of lead compounds against more stringent Candidate Criteria; (c) identification of target for
lead series or compound. In this way, we intend to help fill the pre-clinical candidate pipeline for HAT and CD."

The ultimate goal of this proposal is to address a fundamental gap in knowledge on the role of the cell cycle
inhibitor p16 in regulating pro-tumorigenic metabolism. The results from these studies could have a significant
impact on the treatment of melanoma patients, of which ~30-40% have downregulation or deletion of p16. This
research plan focuses on experimentally and mechanistically determining the role of p16 loss in pro-tumorigenic
nucleotide metabolism and whether this pathway can be targeted in p16-low melanomas alone or in combination
with mutant BRAF inhibitors to obtain a sustained therapeutic response. The proposed studies are based on
preliminary findings that loss of p16 expression upregulates the newly-identified ATR-mTORC1 signaling axis to
increase nucleotide metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway, and modulation of this pathway is a
metabolic vulnerability for p16-low cancer cells. In line with these data, we will explore two overarching scientific
aims: 1) to mechanistically dissect the ATR-mTORC1 pathway downstream of p16 loss in melanomagenesis
and determine the contribution of pro-tumorigenic nucleotide metabolism to the observed phenotypes; and 2) to
elucidate whether targeting the ATR-mTORC1 pathway in combination is synergistic in p16-low melanomas
alone or in combination with mutant BRAF inhibitors. The completion of the scientific aims of this proposal will
not only provide new mechanistic insights into the interplay between metabolism and the cell cycle during
tumorigenesis, but will also establish targeting the novel ATR-mTORC1 axis as a strategy to improve therapeutic
outcome for melanoma patients with low p16 expression. The proposed research is of high impact because the
mechanistic underpinning of these pathways has the potential to transform the management of melanomas with
low p16. As p16 is altered in ~50% of all human cancers, these studies will have far-reaching implications for
identifying metabolic vulnerabilities and developing future cancer therapeutic strategies for a wide range of
patients."

The goal of this application is to determine the role of estrogen and its receptors - estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1)
and G protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER1) – in regulating intraocular pressure (IOP) through
trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelial cells. IOP is the primary and only modifiable
risk factor for patients affected with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in the clinic. TM and SC modulate
majority of aqueous humor outflow resistance in the conventional pathway. Despite the significant research
progress in TM/SC outflow dynamics, limited therapeutic targets are available for modulating the conventional
outflow. It is necessary to identify novel targets to lower IOP more efficiently in glaucoma patients with
progressive visual field loss. Several recent genome-wide association studies have identified >150 IOP-
associated genomic loci, which is too many to follow up functionally. Our comprehensive bioinformatics
analyses of these IOP-associated genomic loci indicate the enrichment of ESR1-related gene networks
among these IOP genes. Factors related with menarche, menopause, and oophorectomy have been
associated with POAG. Genetic associations have been identified between sequence variants in estrogen
receptor pathway genes and POAG. Estrogen and ESR1-related pathways including aromatase may affect
the aqueous humor outflow facility and regulate IOP levels. The presence of estradiol in aqueous humor and
ESR1 protein in the TM/SC region further supports the potential role of estrogen and ESR1-related pathways
in IOP regulation. Based on our preliminary data on the elevated IOP levels from mouse models with the loss
of Esr1 or Gper1 as well as their interaction with Nos3, we hypothesize that activation of estrogen signaling
via ESR1 and GPER1 decreases IOP and POAG risk by modulating the turnover of extracellular matrix in the
TM and the NO signaling in the SC. We propose to determine the in vivo effects of loss of estrogen signaling
via Gper1 (Aim 1) or Esr1 (Aim 2) in murine eyes using tissue-specific knockout mice, and to determine the
underlying mechanisms of Gper1 and Esr1-mediated IOP regulation using in vitro primary cell culture models
(Aim3). Successful completion of this project will help reveal the critical role of estrogen signaling in aqueous
outflow pathway and identify novel therapeutic targets to reduce IOP more effectively for this sight-threatening
disease."

The broad goal of the proposed work is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of a specialized computer-
delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to supplement standard alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment in
patients with a co-occurring anxiety disorder (“comorbidity”). Comorbidity is both common in AUD treatment
patients (up to 50%) and confers a substantial increase in the risk of a return to drinking in the months
following treatment. Because research shows that simply adding a standard psychiatric treatment does not
substantially improve the AUD outcomes of comorbid individuals, we developed a CBT-based intervention
aimed at disrupting the positive-feedback loop (“vicious cycle”; VC) of mutually aggravating negative affect and
drinking behavior/urges (the “VC-CBT”). In an RCT, AUD treatment patients who received the therapist-
delivered VC-CBT demonstrated significantly improved alcohol use outcomes as compared to those who
received a standard anxiety treatment. Unfortunately, most community-based AUD treatment programs do not
have clinical staff with the specialized training and technical expertise needed to deliver the VC-CBT. To help
bridge this “research-to-practice” gap, we went on to develop a fully autonomous and interactive computer-
delivered version of the VC-CBT and have demonstrated its functionality in AUD patients. Now, we propose to
test the clinical efficacy of the computer-delivered VC-CBT, as well as the mechanisms and processes by
which it is hypothesized to work. Aim I is a randomized controlled trial comparing the computer-delivered VC-
CBT to an intensity-matched computer-delivered active control intervention that focuses on healthy lifestyles.
256 individuals in residential AUD treatment who have a comorbid anxiety disorder will receive either the VC-
CBT or the active control intervention to obtain 200 cases that complete a 1-, 4- and 8-month follow-up. We
predict the VC-CBT group will demonstrate superior alcohol-related outcomes at follow-up relative to the
control group. Aim II evaluates the extent to which the computer-delivered VC-CBT selectively imparts the
skills and knowledge targeted and whether they convey (mediate) the interventions therapeutic effect. This
entails a formal series of “causal steps” analyses of the associations of: treatmentskills/knowledge;
skills/knowledge outcomes; and, treatmentoutcomes with vs. without statistically controlling the effect of
skills/knowledge. Aim III will test the theoretically-derived prediction that the computer-delivered VC-CBT
moderates (i.e., weakens) the association between levels of real-time negative affect and drinking behavior/
urge. This will be accomplished by analyzing a series of twice-daily ecological momentary assessments
(EMAs) that participants record in their natural environment for the 7 days prior to each of the three follow-up
assessments. The impact of this work would be to provide a scalable and inexpensive means of improving
the otherwise poor AUD treatment outcomes of comorbid AUD treatment patients. The work will also provide
new scientific knowledge about the mechanisms and processes of change in comorbidity treatment."

The goal of this proposal is to determine the effects of explicitly driven or implicitly driven walking modifications
on muscle activation patterns and co-contraction post-stroke. This work is significant, as studies have shown
that muscle activation patterns after neurologic injury cannot generate walking kinematics comparable to those
seen in neurotypical individuals; this finding implies that to attain true walking recovery after neurologic injury,
interventions should aim to restore the muscle activations underlying walking behaviors. Here, we first explore
muscle activations during walking using biofeedback to guide explicit modification of walking patterns, which is
a common approach used in clinical and research interventions for walking retraining. We hypothesize that
explicit walking modifications might be detrimental at a muscle activation level as they engage cortical
pathways for voluntary control that have been interrupted by the stroke lesion, resulting in increased muscle
co-contraction. Co-contraction hinders true recovery as it impairs the ability to selectively control different
segments during walking, resulting in overreliance on compensatory patterns. We will also explore muscle
activation patterns during implicit walking modifications. We will use external modifications in the walking
environment, mainly split-belt adaptation followed by tied belt walking, to assess if implicit modifications of
walking that rely less on cortical neural control are associated with levels of co-contraction comparable to
neurotypical controls—an indication that implicitly-mediated modifications could be a more effective approach
to restore muscle activation patterns during walking post-stroke. In this study, we will assess co-contraction
during walking in people post-stroke as they reduce asymmetry in step lengths guided by explicit biofeedback
(Aim 1) or implicitly following split-belt adaptation and washout (Aim 2). Our central hypothesis is that given
differences in the neural control of explicitly- vs. implicitly-mediated walking modifications, we will observe
greater levels of co-contraction with interventions that rely on explicit compared to implicit control.
Supplementing this central hypothesis, we also predict that co-contraction will be associated with motor
impairment, and in more impaired individuals co-contraction will be exacerbated by explicit modifications given
the reliance on lesioned cortical pathways. Our results will identify the tasks and conditions that can reduce co-
contraction to promote restoration of neuromuscular control post-stroke. This proposal aligns with the NCMRR
research priority to develop objective markers of treatment response and functional progress that predict
rehabilitation treatment response and enable the tailoring of interventions to the needs, abilities, and resources
of the person with disability."

10818340,"Chronic heavy or binge alcohol consumption damages the structural and functional integrity of the brain.
Ethanol’s neurotoxic and degenerative effects target white matter (WM) across the lifespan, resulting in loss of
myelin, impaired myelin maintenance, and degeneration of axons. Since WM integrity is critical to many CNS
functions, better understanding of how ethanol exerts its adverse effects on WM is needed to prevent or
remediate the associated neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits. Oligodendrocyte dysfunction is at the core of
WM degeneration since oligodendroglia are responsible for synthesizing and maintaining myelin. Myelin is
needed to support and protect axons and ensure efficient neuronal conductivity. We hypothesize that alcohol-
related brain degeneration (ARBD) involving WM could be divided into: 1) an early, reversible stage that is
mainly associated with myelin loss and mediated by oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurotoxic ceramide
accumulation via myelin breakdown and dysregulation of lipid metabolism; and 2) a later stage marked by
impaired insulin/IGF-1 signaling through PI3K-Akt-mTOR-mTORC. Consequences of the latter include loss of
mature oligodendrocytes and compact myelin, impaired maturation of oligodendroglia, axonal damage, and
further progressive dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism with ceramide accumulation and sulfatide depletion.
We anticipate that abstinence will be sufficient to remediate early stages of WM ARBD, whereas active
interventions, such as insulin sensitizer treatments, will be required to reverse WM damage sustained by long
periods of heavy alcohol exposure. However, both early and late stages of ARBD will likely respond to ceramide
inhibitors such as myriocin. Aim 1 will characterize the structural, biochemical and molecular pathologies of
early-stage WM ARBD in an established rat model of chronic ethanol exposure. Aim 2 will utilize a rat model
and human postmortem brains to assess the roles of impaired insulin/IGF-1 signaling through PI3K-Akt-mTOR
and mTORC1 versus mTORC2 as drivers of oligodendrocyte dysfunction and altered sphingolipid metabolism
in the later stages of WM ARBD. Aim 3 will evaluate the effectiveness of abstinence, ceramide inhibitor, and
insulin sensitizer treatments in remediating oligodendrocyte dysfunction and associated alterations in myelin
sphingolipid composition in early versus late stages of WM ARBD. In addition, a novel sub-aim will determine
the degree to which ethanol-induced CNS WM myelin sphingolipid abnormalities and their responses to
treatment can be detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Our underlying hypotheses are
addressed through the use of quantitative immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, multiplex ELISAs,
mRNA studies, and Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry. The research plan
is novel, mechanistic, robust, transparent, and inclusive of both sexes, human validation studies, prospects for
stratifying treatment according to ARBD stage, and approaches for potentially monitoring ARBD-associated
WM biochemical pathology and responses to treatment with non-invasive PBMC assays."

10748398,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy with broadly (b) neutralizing (n) antibodies (Abs)
holds great promise for preventing and treating HIV infection. This approach is unique in that host cells, after
receiving the relevant genes through AAV transduction, can immediately begin to secrete bnAbs into the
circulation. Because AAV is non-pathogenic and its genome persists in host cells, successful AAV transduction
of long-lived cells, such as muscle cells, can result in continuous expression of bnAbs for years, possibly
decades. Since realizing this vision in humans would dramatically simplify efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS
pandemic, this project focuses on overcoming a key obstacle to the clinical use of AAV/bnAb therapy: the high
prevalence of anti-AAV nAbs in humans. Anti-AAV nAbs target the AAV capsid and are mainly induced by natural
infection with wild-type (WT) AAV, which is endemic in primates. AAV seroprevalence varies geographically,
ranging from 30% to 100%, depending on the AAV serotype. Because of structural similarities among different
capsids, nAbs induced by infection with WT AAV often cross-react with other AAV serotypes, including those used
for gene therapy. This is problematic because, depending on the nAb titer, Ab-mediated neutralization of AAV
vectors can reduce or even abrogate transduction. Hence, AAV seropositive (+) individuals are currently excluded
from clinical trials of AAV-based gene therapies. These observations, viewed in the context of the 38 million
people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide who could benefit from AAV/bnAb therapy, highlight the need to develop
strategies to overcome pre-existing anti-AAV nAbs. Here we propose a series of approaches to bypass humoral
immunity to AAV in AAV(+) individuals, with the ultimate goal of expanding people’s access to AAV/bnAb therapy.
This project has four specific aims. Our first aim is to identify the least prevalent muscle-tropic AAV capsid in sub-
Saharan Africa, home of two thirds of all PLWH. Knowledge gained from this serosurvey would allow AAV(–)
PLWH to benefit from AAV/bnAb therapies without any additional intervention. Aim 1 will also establish the range
of pre-existing anti-AAV nAb titers that must be overcome to enable AAV transduction in field settings. Our second
and third aims are to assess the extent to which transient depletion of serum IgG Abs can decrease anti-AAV nAb
titers in AAV(+) rhesus macaques (RMs). Our final aim is to integrate the findings of Aims 1-3 by testing whether
depleting pre-existing anti-AAV nAbs in RMs with pharmacologically controlled simian immunodeficiency virus
(SIV) infection can enhance AAV-mediated delivery of eCD4-Ig–a bnAb-like molecule that potently neutralizes
both HIV and SIV. Aim 4 will also assess the ability of AAV-expressed eCD4-Ig to maintain antiretroviral therapy-
free control of SIV virus replication. Thus, this project will not only establish a blueprint for testing AAV-based
HIV immunotherapies in the epicenter of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, but it will also expand our toolkit of
interventions for evading pre-existing immunity to AAV. If successful, this research could bring us closer to
achieving sustained AAV-driven production of anti-HIV biologics in people, regardless of AAV serostatus."

10840449,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microbial infections are a major cause of infant mortality worldwide. For particularly vulnerable populations
such as pre-term and low birthweight babies, the risk of invasive infections further escalates. The neonatal
period is defined by a distinct, often described as immature, immune system. Many features of a protective
host response to infection are deficient as compared with older children and adults. Our laboratory has
identified that expression of the immune suppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-27 is elevated in human and
murine neonates. Other recent studies have shown IL-27 to be a biomarker for early onset neonatal sepsis.
This suggests that elevated IL-27 may represent a risk factor and when further increased during bacterial
challenge, compromise the host immune response. The overall premise of the current proposal is that IL-27 is
a host molecule that represents a target for immune intervention to improve the host response and reduce
susceptibility to bacterial infection early in life. We present strong evidence in a mouse model that the absence
of IL-27 signaling translates to increased survival, improved weight gain, and enhanced clearance of bacteria
during neonatal sepsis. To advance our knowledge of how IL-27 regulates the immune response during
neonatal sepsis, we need to identify the complete repertoire of cell types responsible for IL-27 production,
understand how these population may change over the course of infection, and further define their
functionality. We will address this gap in understanding using an IL-27 reporter mouse that expresses a
fluorescent protein under control of the IL-27p28 promoter. Using whole-animal imaging of the reporter mouse
coupled with luminescent bacteria, this will allow us to identify IL-27 producers, sort them for further functional
analysis, and correlate their presence in infected tissues with the bacterial burden. We also seek to understand
cellular signaling pathways required for IL-27-mediated suppressive activity and compromised control of the
bacterial burden. We hypothesize that signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)-3 signals
downstream of IL-27 receptor binding to interfere with lysosomal trafficking and acidification. The net result is
compromised bacterial clearance. Lastly, a primary objective is to investigate the outcomes of antagonizing IL-
27 during neonatal sepsis with the aim of establishing an immunotherapeutic approach for an infectious
disease for which we can currently only offer antibiotics and supportive care. Antibiotic resistance confounds
our reliance on this approach. Administration of a neutralizing antibody conjugated to a fluorescent tag will
allow for visualization of tissue penetration in real time and directly correlate the presence of the antagonist
with control of bacterial growth. At the completion of this project, we expect to have performed preclinical
validation of a promising immunotherapeutic approach to improve immunological responses and susceptibility
to infection disease in newborns, as well as provided an enhanced understanding of how IL-27 regulates host
immunity and interactions with bacterial pathogens during neonatal sepsis."
10840363,"Project Summary
Hematopoiesis involves the continuous production of red blood cells (erythrocytes), immune cells (leukocytes)
and blood clotting platelets over the lifespan of the subject all of which are derived from hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) located in bone marrow. HSCs have two critical characteristics - multipotency and self-renewal. A
complete picture of the molecular mechanisms regulating homeostatic output of blood from HSCs in vivo has
not yet emerged. Our published findings show HSCs are endowed with low intracellular calcium (Ca2+)
compared to bone marrow (BM) progenitor and lineage cells. We hypothesized a reduced extracellular calcium
environment, such as a low CaCl2 culture media, might improve HSC function. Remarkably, reduced CaCl2
media dramatically increased phenotypic HSC counts in long-term cultures and demonstrated a 20-fold increase
in long-term donor engraftment compared to classical CaCl2 media formulation, suggesting functionally potent
HSCs are maintained in low CaCl2. We demonstrated that HSC maintain low Ca2+ levels via high expression
and activity of plasma membrane calcium efflux pumps (PMCA) and reduced bone marrow interstitial fluid CaCl2
levels. Reduced CaCl2 decreased mitochondrial respiration, but not glycolysis, specifically in HSCs, while
inhibition of glycolysis elevated HSC Ca2+. These results demonstrate a positive feedback mechanism whereby
glycolytic PMCA Ca2+ efflux activity reduces Ca2+ and prevents mitochondrial respiration and promotes
glycolysis. Curiously, we showed mitochondrial mass is highest in HSCs suggesting an important, albiet
respiration-independent, role in HSCs. Building on these findings, literature suggests reduced CaCl2 can induce
ER stress. We observed Bcl-2 exhibits a dose-dependent upregulation under reduced CaCl2 culture conditions
in HSCs, suggesting induction of a pro-survival gene program. Regulators of the antioxidant genes known to be
induced by ER stress, including ATF4 and Nrf2, mediate upregulation of antioxidant genes including Bcl-2. We
found ATF4 and Nrf2 were also high expressed in HSCs in low CaCl2 culture. Therefore, we hypothesize that
reduced CaCl2 induces a hormetic ER stress response that supports HSC maintenance in vitro. We propose to
study what types of ER stresses occur and which unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling path branches are
activated in response low CaCl2. We propose to characterize the transcriptional program regulated by the PERK
branch of UPR, which activates the Atf4/Nrf2 ER stress response programs, that we have identified to be active.
Further, we propose to study the upregulation of Bcl-2 in HSCs under low CaCl2 conditions to determine if a
non-canonical role for Bcl-2 inhibits IP3R release of Ca2+ from luminal ER Ca2+ stores in HSCs. Furthermore,
we propose to corroborate these findings in human CB HSCs to accelerate translational potential of the findings.
This would establish a novel positive feedback loop required to reduce Ca2+ levels and preserve self-renewal
and multipotency in HSCs. These findings will expand our fundamental understanding of HSC biology and may
inspire methods to improve HSC expansion for clinical applications."

The progression of T cell precursors from multipotency to commitment occurs after multiple cell cycles in the
thymus. These early, pre-commitment cell cycles are important for expansion of the precursors to generate
enough pro-T cells to survive later selection events. However, the early stages are poorly understood, and in
particular it has not been clear what controls the precise trajectory of the cells' differentiation nor the timing or
irreversibility of commitment when it occurs. Genomic regulatory elements that are active after commitment
tend to be characterized by motifs for basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E proteins, E2A or HEB, whereas those
that are active before commitment have other signatures, suggesting that there is a major increase in E protein
activity across this transition. In fact, the expression of E proteins is almost equally high before commitment,
but our recent data show that they are occupied in substantially different roles before commitment, in
complexes with other heterodimerization partners. This proposal is based on recent evidence that the
alternative complex, containing Lmo2 and Lyl1 dimerized with E2A or HEB, may actually be a major controller
of the commitment transition in early T cells. Our recent evidence shows that expression of Lmo2 and Lyl1 is
sufficient to make committed pro-T cells reverse their differentiation in terms of gene expression. Not only
does the Lmo2/Lyl1/E2A complex bind to different genomic sites than E protein dimers, but also the addition of
Lmo2 and Lyl1 to committed pro-T cells is sufficient to remove E proteins from sites that they occupy after
commitment and shift them to sites that are normally active only before commitment. The implication is that
the kinetics of downregulation of Lmo2 and Lyl1 in normal T-cell differentiation could be vital for determining
the timing of commitment and of the maturation of the pro-T cells. Lmo2 and Lyl1 have been considered as T-
lineage proto-oncogenes, but our evidence suggests a potent role in normal development.
This proposal is to determine the mechanism of how this works and to test its significance for the actual
developmental dynamics of normal early T cells. Our preliminary work identifies the signature target genes
affected by Lmo2+Lyl1 and their overlap with genes expressed in normal pro-T cells. We now propose to
define: (1) the distinct molecular mechanisms that control different subsets of these signature genes, based on
genome-wide mapping of the chromatin state changes caused by Lmo2+Lyl1/E protein complex binding as
compared to pure E protein dimer binding; (2) whether endogenous Lmo2/Lyl1/E protein complexes indeed
control differentiation kinetics and commitment of normal pro-T cells, based on acute CRISPR and monitoring
in vitro and in vivo; and (3) the gene regulatory network architecture, involving factors regulated by Lmo2+Lyl1,
through which Lmo2+Lyl1 exert their surprisingly broad impacts on T cell development. The results should
determine whether and how a biochemical mechanism of transcription factor heterodimerization partner
switching may explain a central unsolved problem in the dynamics of T cell development."

AD is the 4th leading cause of death among African Americans and African Americans are two to three times
more likely to develop AD compared to non-Hispanic Caucasians. Given the high prevalence of diabetes and
obesity and the emerging evidence that up to 50% of AD cases are a result of modifiable risk factors,
prevention strategies may play a critical role in reducing AD risk for AAs. Previous research has indicated that
adherence to healthy diets such as the Mediterranean diet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH),
and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurogenerative Delay (MIND) help slow cognitive decline among
adults 65 years and older. However, adherence and acceptability of such diets remain low among African
Americans, due to lack of cultural considerations. Thus, there is a critical need for the development of a
culturally adapt brain healthy diet that is congruent with African American cultural values and food
preferences. Creating a culturally relevant brain healthy diet for African Americans, will enhance both
acceptability and adherence which are essential to lifestyle behavioral changes. The proposed project aligns
well with the NIA Strategic Directions for Research Goal C-3: Develop interventions for treating, preventing, or
mitigating the impact of age-related diseases and condition; by meaningfully incorporating a culturally tailored
approach to an adapted diet intervention to reduce the risk of cardiovascular risk factors related to AD and to
maintain independence among older African Americans. Specifically, Dr. Shaw plans to address the following
specific aims (1) develop an adapted brain healthy soul food diet intervention; (2) pilot test an adapted brain-
healthy soul food diet intervention; (3) explore the effect of the adapted brain-healthy soul food diet intervention
of cognitive function as preliminary data to design a RCT. To achieve these specific aims, Dr. Shaw will work
with a highly skilled mentorship team (Drs. Jeffrey Burns, Debra Sullivan, and Janette Berkley-Patton) and
consultants (Dr. Crystal Glover and Mr. Broderick Crawford) to build four areas of expertise relevant to the
research agenda: (1) ARDR clinical trial design and implementation (2) cultural tailoring of established diets (3)
qualitative design and analysis (4) community-based research design. The K01 award will enhance Dr. Shaw's
capabilities to successfully transition into an independent researcher who has expertise in the development
and evaluation of culturally tailored lifestyle interventions to reduce AD risk among African Americans. Results
of the proposed research will enhance our understanding of how AA culture influences current dietary practice,
adherence, acceptability, and feasibility of a brain-healthy diet for older AA. Results will also positively impact
the development of R01 scale RCT to test the efficacy of an adapted brain-healthy diet intervention among
older AA across a larger geographical area."

While the past decade has seen an explosion in basic genomic research, the clinical implementation of
genomic medicine remains elusive. This Specialized Innovation Program (SIP) will identify and overcome
barriers that impede the translational science of rapid genomic medicine discoveries at the point of care by
assembling the infrastructure, technology, and strategies to design and develop a rapid genomic diagnostic
platform, using the newborn intensive care unit (NICU) as a laboratory. Emerging clinical guidelines support
the value and utility of rapid whole-genome sequencing in the NICU, yet multiple barriers impede the
widespread use of this technology at the point of care. Specifically, (1) less than half of rare Mendelian
diseases are solvable using current sequencing and analytical technologies; (2) industry electronic health
record (EHR)-based genomic medicine applications are essentially nonexistent, with a lack of EHR-interfaced
platforms that allow for visualization and team-based interpretation of genomic sequencing; (3) translational
science strategies to implement genomic medicine into clinical care are currently lacking. To overcome these
barriers, the SIP will design and develop an innovative, collaborative, patient-focused, and EHR-interfaced
translational platform that efficiently integrates rapid genomic medicine at the point of care, using the NICU as
a laboratory. Aim 1 will design novel tools that will improve the discovery of all forms of genetic variation,
including difficult-to-detect complex structural variants. These novel tools will be shared as open-source
software, with accompanying tools for dissemination and implementation, to empower translational genomic
science across the CTSA network. Aim 2 will deploy a portable EHR-interfaced platform for rapid genomic
diagnostics that is appropriate, acceptable, and feasible across EHR systems and will catalyze clinical and
translational science locally, regionally, and nationally. Aim 3 will use a participatory planning strategy and
state of the science dissemination and implementation science methods to develop, tailor, and operationalize
strategies to support NICU adoption, implementation, and sustainability of a translational platform for rapid
genomic diagnostics. These strategies will be compiled into a generalizable blueprint to foster genomic
innovations across the CTSA network and empower broader adoption and sustained implementation of
genomic medicine."

This T32 predoctoral training program proposes to train 6 postdoctoral trainees annually, totaling 30 trainees
across 5 years. Each trainee will receive funding for two years. We will create a cadre of scholars with
commanding knowledge and experiences across all three translational spheres as well as a deep commitment
to transdisciplinary team science. This T32 will provide the necessary early-career training to produce a
diverse pool of highly trained scientists with the requisite skills to address the nation’s biomedical, behavioral,
and clinical research needs. Our conceptual framework organizes the translational continuum into three
spheres: Discovery, Demonstration, and Dissemination. Scholars undertake and become domain experts
within one sphere and receive training in bridging domains and exposure across the spheres, emerging with a
broad, invaluable perspective of how their research fits within the breadth of translational science and how
discoveries move through the continuum. In addition to domain-specific training overseen by primary mentors,
the T32 program includes training in: (1) core knowledge of translational science research; (2) the value of and
skills needed in team science; (3) how equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) contribute to scientific excellence;
(4) research ethics and reproducibility; (4) community engagement; (5) career and leadership development; (6)
grant and manuscript writing; and (7) bridging domains and scientific and lay communication. We are equally
committed to ensuring a diverse group of scholars in order to ensure the pipeline of scientists are as diverse as
the subjects they research. However, recruiting diverse scholars is not enough to ensure an environment
where diverse scholars can thrive. To create such a space, it is critical to teach to all trainees and mentors the
history of racism in science and medicine and how to be an anti-racist scientist. Thus, all trainees and their
primary mentors will receive this training. During their training T32 scholars will receive holistic mentoring and
career guidance from not only their primary mentor, but also secondary, near-peer, and program leadership. In
collaboration with mentors, we will develop a cadre of scholars who are experts in their domains, with a
commanding knowledge of translational science, who have the ability to innovate and advance translation and
who are skilled communicators, boundary crossers, and team-players with a deep commitment to
transdisciplinary team science. Our overarching goal is to produce a new generation of scientists with strategic
translational emphases whose breadth of knowledge and ability to communicate across boundaries will
increase transdisciplinary cross-fertilization and accelerate healthcare advances."
10857357,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a serious public health problem. Alcohol-related brain defects and alcohol-
associated cognitive impairments contribute to the progression of AUD. About 50-80% of patients with AUD
have cognitive impairments. These cognitive impairments persist over years and get worse with age.
Moreover, alcohol-related cognitive impairments may impact AUD outcomes because executive functions and
memory are necessary for self-regulation and learning, which are important during recovery. These cognitive
impairments are especially prevalent in the early phase of recovery and reduce the ability to benefit from
current AUD treatments. Previous research has suggested that cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) may
improve cognitive function and AUD treatment outcomes. There are randomized clinical trials demonstrating
that CRT reduces alcohol craving or drinking. However, a few studies also reported that CRT is not effective in
reducing drinking. Thus, CRT may need to be augmented by another intervention (e.g., cognitive-enhancing
pharmacotherapy) to increase the benefits of CRT. Emerging neurobiological evidence suggests that an
anticholinesterase agent donepezil may treat AUD. Donepezil is currently approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Since donepezil has been clinically
used as a cognitive enhancer, donepezil may treat AUD while enhancing neurocognitive functioning in patients
with AUD. Our pilot data showed that donepezil + CRT might be safe and effective in treating AUD in patients
with AUD and mild cognitive impairment. Thus, we here propose a 13-week, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, between-subjects trial comparing 4 groups (donepezil + CRT vs. donepezil alone vs. CRT
alone vs. placebos) as a treatment for AUD in a total of 160 patients with AUD.
There are two main objectives.
Aim #1: To evaluate if donepezil + CRT is superior to placebo in reducing heavy drinking as measured by
weekly Time Line Follow Back (TLFB). We hypothesize that donepezil + CRT (group 1) is superior to placebo
(group 4) in reducing heavy drinking over 13 weeks of active intervention. We also hypothesize that donepezil
alone (group 2) or CRT alone (group 3) is superior to placebo (group 4) in reducing weekly heavy drinking
days, and group 1 is superior to groups 2 and 3.
Aim #2: To evaluate if donepezil + CRT is superior to placebo in improving global neurocognitive functioning.
We hypothesize that donepezil + CRT is superior to placebo in improving global neurocognitive functioning on
a global index of neurocognitive function at 7 weeks and at 13 weeks.
This project will be the first randomized controlled trial testing donepezil for AUD."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, yet often goes untreated. This is
particularly true among individuals of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Acute medical hospitalization
provides an untapped opportunity to address the AUD treatment gap. To date, AUD-related care has focused
on treatment of acute withdrawal and addressing associated acute medical complications without addressing
the underlying AUD. This overlooks an opportunity “treatable” moment. There are a range of behavioral and
medication treatments that may be initiated prior to hospital discharge to address AUD. However, we lack data
on the optimal approach to enhance post-discharge AUD treatment engagement and alcohol reduction.
Further, the influence of structural racism on more proximal social determinants of health (SDOH, e.g., housing
instability, medical mistrust) among patients hospitalized with AUD and their resulting impact on treatment
engagement and alcohol use post-discharge has not been well characterized. We propose a 3-arm
randomized trial to compare the impact of: 1) a specific brief intervention, the Brief Negotiated Interview with
referral and 2-week telephone booster (BNI) delivered by a health promotion advocate alone to the additional
2) provision of medications for AUD (BNI+MAUD), and 3) the computer-based platform of cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT4CBT; BNI+MAUD+CBT4CBT) among a diverse sample of 450 patients hospitalized with
untreated AUD at a large, urban academic medical center. The primary outcome is engagement in formal AUD
treatment at 30 days post-hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes include formal AUD treatment engagement
at 90 days, changes in alcohol use (by self-report and the alcohol biomarker, phosphatidylethanol), and, the
exploratory outcome of healthcare utilization (Aim 1). We will explore whether the effectiveness of the
interventions differ across and within racial and ethnic groups and based on SDOH (Aim 2). Consistent with a
hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation design, we will conduct an implementation-focused process
evaluation to inform future implementation, including process outcomes, perspectives from clinicians and staff,
and cost (Aim 3). Building on new and longstanding collaborations, the study team includes individuals with
expertise in addiction medicine in hospital settings; behavioral interventions, including brief interventions and
technology-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy; health disparities research; clinical trials; longitudinal
analysis; and implementation science. Study components are readily-scalable and rooted in strong evidence.
This proposal offers innovation given the 1) hospital focus for AUD treatment initiation; 2) evaluation of added
benefit of medications and CBT4CBT to BNI; 3) focus on evaluation of differential effects by race, ethnicity and
SDOH; 4) consideration of the impact of structural racism in all aspects of study design and implementation
with a highly qualified team. The study has potential for high impact by generating data on reproducible and
scalable approaches to transform hospital-based AUD treatment initiation nationally."

Gene-drug-drug interactions (GDDIs) are becoming a new frontier in Precision Medicine (PM).
Pharmacogenomics can certainly be a good predictive tool to guide drug therapies but is far from being a
deterministic measure of phenotypes. A current limitation in most of existing guidelines is their lack of provisions
to address the effect of drug combinations, co-medications and, therefore, the risk for GDDIs. Although the high
inter-individual variability in the response to clopidogrel has primarily been associated with genetic
polymorphisms, multivariate analyses suggest that additional factors (e.g., GDDIs) may contribute to the overall
between-subject variability in treatment response. However, the extent to which each of these additional factors
contributes to the overall variability, and how they are interrelated, is currently unclear. To this purpose, we
propose to derive, for the first time ever, a weighted genetic risk score system based on a genome-wide
association study in Caribbean Hispanic patients and machine learning methods. We also plan on developing a
novel semi-mechanistic population-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) modeling of clopidogrel
in individuals with GDDIs with cilostazol in order to identify the clinically relevant factors affecting drug exposure
and response, which may ultimately serve as a solid basis for dosing optimization and tailoring therapies. Based
on strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that:
“The enhancing effect of cilostazol over the clopidogrel-induced anti-platelet activity in Caribbean Hispanic
patients exposed to these interacting co-medications is exclusive of those who also are CYP2C19 PMs and
CYP3A5 non-expressers”
This study is expected to provide important new information on the proportions of individuals from the Caribbean
Hispanic population who are likely to have combinations of pharmacogenomics variants and exposure to
interacting co-medications that may eventually affect their health care. Hispanics have been largely excluded
from PM initiatives, which increase dramatically the disparities in translating benefits from new findings in
pharmacogenomics to this medically underserved population, exacerbating the existing inequity in healthcare
services. Accordingly, the proposed research will expand our current understanding of the PK-PD interactions
between clopidogrel and cilostazol from a pharmacogenetics perspective. Advancing knowledge in the under-
investigated area of pharmacogenetics in minority populations will generate results that apply to personalize
antiplatelet therapy in the wider population as it moves, inevitably, toward increasing heterogeneity through
admixed genomes."

 This R33 application proposes a mechanistic clinical trial testing the effects of psilocybin on affective
mechanisms of chronic pain in patients with comorbid chronic low back pain and depression (CLBP+D). CLBP
is the top cause of disability worldwide, and is highly comorbid with depression. Patients with CLBP+D face a
fragmented and limited set of treatment options that insufficiently address their pain and depression symptoms.
As such, CLBP treatment guidelines call for a shift away from a sole outcome focus on pain intensity and
toward treatments that enhance affective function. Positive and negative affect, pain catastrophizing, and
positive affective pain inhibition are well-characterized, modifiable, biologically-mediated mechanisms of
chronic pain that we propose to target in this study of patients with CLBP+D. Psilocybin, a classic (5-HT2A
receptor-mediated) psychedelic, is a promising non-opioid candidate for the treatment of CLBP+D that reliably
and durably improves affective function in healthy individuals, patients with major depressive disorder, and
patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis. We aim to test whether psilocybin will benefit patients with
CLBP+D by durably improving positive affect, negative affect, and pain catastrophizing, and augmenting the
ability of positive affect to inhibit pain. The proposed study addresses an important unmet need, as it will be the
first, to our knowledge, to test the ability of psilocybin to target pain-related affective function in patients with
chronic pain. We propose a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing the administration of high-
dose psilocybin (25mg absolute dose; n=20) to an active control (methylphenidate 40mg absolute dose; n=20)
among patients with CLBP+D. Psilocybin or methylphenidate will be administered once in the laboratory under
close supervision and supportive monitoring. Primary outcomes will be positive and negative affect (Aim 1),
pain catastrophizing (Aim 2), and positive affective pain inhibition (Aim 3). Ecological momentary assessment
will be used to evaluate the hypotheses that aggregated momentary reports of positive and negative affect and
pain catastrophizing will improve from baseline to 1-week post-session to a greater extent in patients in the
psilocybin versus the methylphenidate condition. Quantitative sensory testing will be used to evaluate the
hypothesis that positive affective pain inhibition will increase from baseline to 1-week post-session to a greater
extent in patients in the psilocybin versus the methylphenidate condition. The durability of outcomes will be
tested at 1-month post-administration in secondary analyses. By testing the effects of psilocybin on affective
function in CLBP+D, we will develop critical data that will provide mechanistic insight into the utility of
psilocybin as a pain management medicine. These data will build off our extensive preliminary findings in
support of psilocybin’s efficacy for major depressive disorder, and pave the way for future pivotal efficacy trials
for psilocybin as a primary treatment for patients with CLBP+D."

 The opioid epidemic continues to rage, taking a vast toll on morbidity and mortality across the U.S. Despite
efforts to expand availability of life-saving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), a significant gap re-
mains in access to and continuity in these treatments. Given the high frequency of encounters with acute-care
settings among patients with opioid use disorder (OUD), emergency departments and hospitals are increas-
ingly seen as ‘touchpoints’ to promote initiation of MOUD treatment. Growing evidence around the efficacy of
initiating MOUD in the hospital and linking people to community treatment has led to a rapid growth of such
hospital-based interventions. However, little is known about the nature or success of strategies used to transi-
tion patients from hospital settings to community-based MOUD treatment. Knowing which transition strategies
are most effective in improving engagement in MOUD treatment post-hospitalization is critical to supporting
patients through the ‘OUD Cascade of Care’ towards reduced overdose risk and improved health.
 The goal of this K01 Award is to address these gaps while advancing the candidate’s career goal of becom-
ing an independent investigator who works at the interface of intervention and implementation research, epide-
miology, and policy to advance knowledge on strategies to improve access to, uptake and sustainability of evi-
dence-based services for opioid and other substance use disorders. Through coursework, scientific confer-
ences, experiential learning, and close mentorship from experts in addiction, health services research and
qualitative and quantitative methods at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and partner institutions, Dr.
Krawczyk will develop competency in the delivery of addiction services and acute care interventions; mixed
methods for collecting and analyzing data on healthcare practices and their implementation; analysis of multi-
level healthcare data from diverse datasets; and professional skills for grant writing and research partnerships.
 The proposed research will employ quantitative and qualitative methods to study the nature and role of
transition strategies used to link OUD patients from hospitals to ongoing MOUD engagement in the community
using a case study of 11 public hospitals in NYC. Research aims are to (1) Develop a taxonomy and subse-
quent survey of hospital OUD care transition strategies via review of the literature and input from an expert
Delphi panel; (2) Conduct in-depth interviews with provider and patient stakeholders regarding primary barriers
and facilitators to effective transitions, and; (3) Explore multi-level associations between patient characteristics,
hospital transition strategies, and post-discharge MOUD engagement outcomes. This work is in line with
NIDA’s goals to conduct research that addresses real-world complexities, explores sustainable implementation
of evidence-based practices for substance use treatment, and studies the integration of treatment services in
diverse health care settings. By providing salary support, training, and a formal mentorship structure, this
award will facilitate Dr. Krawczyk’s transition to an independent career in addiction health services research."
10744243,"Sarcoidosis is a pulmonary and systemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause. To better understand
disease mechanisms, we have recently established a novel in vitro human granuloma model that shares many
structural and molecular features of the disease in human tissues, yielding novel insights into mechanisms
regulating early granuloma formation. In keeping with prior investigations and clinical experience linking
sarcoidosis to elevated leves of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in sarcoidosis tissues, molecular
characterization of the sarcoidosis granuloma model indicates that macrophages participating in sarcoidosis
granuloma formation are regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Our strong
preliminary data shows that sarcoidosis macrophages produce aldosterone, a hormone that promotes
inflammation through the activation of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs); and we further show that suppression
of the RAAS pathway (e.g., ACE inhibition) or inhibition of MRs attenuates granuloma formation. We
hypothesize that RAAS promotes pathological granuloma formation in patients with sarcoidosis through
activation of MRs. In the spirit of the R21 funding mechanisms, this project is highly innovative and has
important beneficial implications for advancing our understanding of sarcoidosis disease mechanisms and for
providing novel therapeutic targets and disease biomarkers. Aim 1 will determine if the balance between
ACE1 and ACE2 (a suppressor of ACE1-mediated inflammation) regulates sarcoidosis granuloma
formation by controlling angiotensin II levels and related angiotensin 1 receptor (ATR1) activation. We
posit that the balance between ACE and ACE2 influences the formation of granulomas in sarcoidosis patients.
Aim 2 will determine if aldosterone induced MR activation promotes NRF2/HO-1/STAT3 signaling to
promote sarcoidosis granuloma formation, featuring polarization towards CD163 macrophages. These
studies will determine if aldosterone promotes macrophage phagosome-activated signaling pathway
NRF2/HO-1/STAT3 to polarize macrophages towards a CD163 expressing phenotype that is predisposed to
aggregate and form granulomas. Aim 3 will be a pilot study designed to determine if aldosterone levels
achieved in the in vitro granuloma model are predictive of pulmonary sarcoidosis disease progression.
Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers predictive of sarcoidosis disease progression for prognostication
and to guide therapy, and aldosterone is a viable candidate. The short-term goals of this are to advancing
basic understanding of sarcoidosis disease mechanisms and to consider related therapeutic targets. Long-term
aspirations of this project are to address current deficiencies in the field of sarcoidosis as relates to
identifying novel disease-specific therapies (targeting granuloma formation), identifying novel biomarkers
predictive of disease progression, and to ultimately determine if it is feasible to repurpose widely available
RAAS modulating drugs (e.g., ACE, ATR1 and MR inhibitors) for the treatment of sarcoidosis."
10837850,"ABSTRACT. The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with high mortality, morbidity, and
health care costs (Bellani 2016). Dozens of candidate drugs for ARDS have been identified in preclinical
models, but none consistently reduced mortality in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This dismal record is
likely driven in part by the heterogenous biology encompassed within the definition of ARDS (Rubenfeld 2015).
Unsupervised clustering of plasma biomarkers and clinical variables recently identified two molecular
phenotypes of ARDS (Calfee 2014) which may enable predictive enrichment in future RCTs. Uncertainty about
the key biologic mechanisms that distinguish these two phenotypes from each other remains a critical
knowledge gap. The overall objective of this proposal is to recruit patients to an established cohort of
mechanically ventilated patients and identify distinct mechanisms of lung injury in ARDS molecular
phenotypes. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that ARDS phenotypes are driven by different
dysregulated pathways that result in distinct clinical trajectories and responses to treatment. In Aim 1, I will use
single cell RNA sequencing to study tracheal aspirates and develop a model of cell signaling in the lung of
each molecular phenotype. I hypothesize hyperinflammatory ARDS is associated with increased Type 1 T-cell
polarization and a diminished response to interferons in macrophages. In Aim 2, I will use metatranscriptomic
sequencing to characterize differences in the tracheal aspirate microbiome in each phenotype. I hypothesize
TA metatranscriptomes will have distinct microbial community composition in each phenotype, which will be
characterized by increased burden of enteric bacteria in the hypoinflammatory phenotype and an increased
burden of fungi in the hyperinflammatory phenotype. In Aim 3, I will collect longitudinal tracheal aspirate and
plasma samples to study the evolution of pro-inflammatory, pro-resolution, and pro-fibrotic pathways in each
ARDS phenotype. I hypothesize ARDS phenotypes have distinct trajectories of inflammation and repair
pathways in the first week of mechanical ventilation. I will address a critical gap in knowledge required to
develop phenotype-specific precision treatments. This K23 award is sponsored by Dr. Carolyn Calfee, an
experienced ARDS researcher whose group has pioneered analyses of ARDS molecular phenotypes, and Dr.
Stephanie Christenson, a computational biologist with expertise in the transcriptomics of airway diseases.
Their mentorship and the research and training plan in this K23 will support my continued career development
and allow me to learn essential skills I require to be an independent investigator, including advanced
computational analyses, epidemiological methods, and management of a research cohort. Developing these
skills will be essential to achieve my long-term goal of understanding the mechanistic pathways distinguishing
ARDS phenotypes to identify novel potential therapies. The proposed aims lay the foundation for a R01
proposal to study the interaction of pulmonary and systemic inflammation in ARDS phenotypes."
10832028,"Project Summary: While strong empirical evidence shows that exposure to food advertisements increases
short-term food intake and contributes to the development of obesity, not all children are susceptible to this
effect. Identifying the characteristics that protect some children from overeating in response to food advertising
is a public health priority that may highlight novel targets for childhood obesity prevention. We propose to use
state-of-the art, data driven techniques to identify neural, cognitive and behavioral phenotypes that are
associated with resiliency to food-cue induced overeating and determine whether these phenotypes protect
children from weight gain during the critical pre-adolescent period. The driving premise of this proposal is that
children who are resistant to food-cue induced overeating will exhibit a distinct cluster of neural, behavioral,
and cognitive traits which protect them from weight gain in an obesogenic environment. Our preliminary studies
suggest that greater neural activation in prefrontal cortical regions implicated in cognitive control, increased
executive functioning, and lower food advertising exposure may be some of the characteristics that confer
resiliency to overeating in response to food advertising cues. To confirm our preliminary findings, we plan to
enroll 140, 7-8 year-old children with healthy weight who vary by risk for obesity (70 low-risk/both parents with
healthy weight; 70 high-risk/both parents with obesity) for a 1-year prospective study. In aim one, we will
compare the effect of exposing children to commercials (i.e., food, toy, and non-rewarding advertisements) on
subsequent neural activation and network connectivity characteristics in response to viewing high-energy food
cues. We hypothesize that exposure to food commercials (vs. toy and non-food) will reduce prefrontal cortex
activation, but that there will be substantial variability in this response across children. In aim two, we will
determine how food commercials affect children’s subsequent food intake at both homeostatic (i.e., ad libitum
test-meals) and non-homeostatic (i.e., eating palatable snacks when not hungry) eating events and relate
these responses to underlying neural circuitry. In aim three, we will test the extent to which children’s executive
function and prior food advertising experience moderate the relationship between food commercial exposure
and subsequent neural and behavioral outcomes. In the final aim, we will use sophisticated data-driven
techniques (i.e., machine learning) to identify neural, behavioral, and cognitive traits that moderate the effect of
familial risk status on weight-gain. We expect the proposed studies to inform the science of obesity prevention
by identifying specific modifiable phenotypes that protect high-risk children from excess weight gain during the
pre-adolescent period. The overall impact of these studies will be to identify novel neural and behavioral
characteristics of resiliency to food advertising in children. It will be the first to focus specifically on
characterizing neural resiliency factors associated with decreased risk of food-cue induced eating and
determine the extent to which these factors protect pre-adolescent children from the development of obesity."

The focus of this proposal is on expanding access to voluntary smoke-free homes to formerly homeless
residents residing in permanent supportive housing, and examining the impact of this intervention on reducing
tobacco-caused disparities. Permanent supportive housing is subsidized housing with closely linked or on-site
medical and/or social services for individuals with a history of chronic homelessness, and who are living with
disabilities, mental health and/or substance use disorders. Permanent supportive housing uses a harm
reduction framework, prioritizing housing stability over any pre-conditions of abstinence. In 2017, over 370,000
formerly homeless individuals lived in permanent supportive housing in the US. Tobacco use is highest among
many of the same populations that live in permanent supportive housing, including people living with

Approximately 50% of people living in permanent supportive housing report current smoking, yet there are no
mandated smoke-free policies in permanent supportive housing. One of the concerns is that such policies may
contradict permanent supportive housing’s harm reduction framework if it had the unintended consequence of
increasing evictions related to policy violations. One strategy that we developed and tested in a pilot study is
an intervention to increase voluntary adoption of smoke-free homes. The multi-faceted intervention, delivered
by study staff includes: 1) one-on-one counseling to permanent supportive housing residents who are smokers
on how to adopt a smoke-free home, and 2) training for permanent supportive housing staff on how to provide
referrals to cessation services. In this study, we will conduct a multi-site, community-based cluster-randomized
wait-list controlled trial of our multi-faceted smoke-free home intervention among 400 permanent supportive
housing residents residing in 20 permanent supportive housing sites across the San Francisco Bay Area with
the goal of increasing voluntary adoption of smoke-free homes. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Conduct a
cluster randomized trial to estimate the effect of our smoke-free home intervention on residents' voluntary
adoption of smoke-free homes. Aim 2: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the smoke-free home intervention.
Aim 3: Determine characteristics of high and low adopters at the individual level, and social and environmental
barriers and enablers of adoption, scalability and sustainability of the intervention. The long-term goal is to
develop evidence-based strategies that can be brought to scale in permanent supportive housing in order to
reduce tobacco-caused cancer disparities among vulnerable populations disproportionately impacted by
tobacco use."

Despite renewed public health efforts, including more effective treatment, tuberculosis (TB) incidence has
reduced only incrementally, an effect driven by the inability to contain community TB transmission. Early
identification and treatment of infectious individuals is central to breaking the chain of transmission and is limited
by the fact that up to 40% of incident TB cases remain undiagnosed. The associated prolonged duration of
infectiousness and delays in treatment initiation contributes significantly to ongoing TB transmission.
Undiagnosed cases comprise diseased individuals who have been missed by the healthcare system and those
without symptoms (subclinical TB) where the ability to transmit TB is unknown. In our preliminary data, using
active case finding and whole blood RNA biomarker, we identified subclinical TB disease at proportions that
approach or exceed that of symptomatic active TB. These cases were associated with the presence of viable
bacilli in the sputum, pointing to a large potentially infectious pool of individuals. In high-transmission settings,
highly targeted approaches like household contact investigation will capture only a small proportion of TB cases,
yet general-population approaches are too inefficient to be practical. New case finding methods are needed that
increase diagnostic yield through targeted screening in high-prevalence and high-transmission subpopulations.
In low-incidence settings, standard mapping tools have been used to identify target populations for enhanced
case-finding. Whether similar methods are sufficient in endemic settings is unknown and critical to advance new
case-finding approaches. To develop appropriate strategies, we must first understand the mechanisms and
spatial patterns of community-level TB transmission that include subclinical TB. Advances in spatial and genomic
statistical modeling coupled with sensitive diagnostics now enable evaluation of spatially targeted TB screening
in high-burden communities. We hypothesize that transmission hotspots harbor large number of individuals with
undiagnosed and subclinical TB that when targeted can improve efficiency of TB case finding. In Aim 1, we
determine the proportion of TB transmission that occur within spatially organized hotspots. In Aim 2, we test
whether spatially targeted case-finding will be more effective and efficient than broader approaches for identifying
active and subclinical prevalent TB. To accomplish our aims, we incorporate innovative spatial statistical
modeling with Bayesian phylodynamic methods to infer TB transmission using whole genome sequencing data,
and use novel RNA biomarker and Xpert Ultra with chest radiography to detect prevalent TB in the community.
If undetected prevalent TB, including subclinical forms are, in fact, concentrated in locales of transmission, this
would have important and practical implications for targeted community TB screening strategies as a means to
identify infectious individuals early and interrupt transmission by early initiation of TB treatment."

Genetic studies in humans revealed that gain-of-function variants of SCN2A are associated with epilepsy,
whereas loss-of-function variants of SCN2A are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However,
about a third of ASD children carrying SCN2A loss-of-function or nonsense variants (collectively referred to as
SCN2A deficiency) develop intractable seizures, major comorbidity associated with ASD. How SCN2A deficiency
contributes to seizure is largely unknown. To address this problem, we generated a Scn2a-deficient mouse
model by gene-trap knockout (gtKO) strategy. Homozygous gene-trap knockout mice have only a quarter of the
Scn2a expression level of WT mice, which model severe Scn2a deficiency. Our preliminary patch-clamp
recordings reveal that neurons with severe Scn2a deficiency displayed neuronal hyperexcitability. This finding is
unexpected, but could open the door for the understanding of the puzzling seizure comorbidity in SCN2A
deficiency-related ASD. However, critical gaps exist regarding the possible mechanisms underlying Scn2a
deficiency-related neuronal hyperexcitability, its consequences on neural network and seizures susceptibility, as
well as the reversibility of seizures-related phenotypes. Filling these gaps would greatly enhance understanding
of the mechanisms underlying seizure comorbidity in ASD; and shed new light on the development of effective
therapeutic interventions. To this end, here we propose to test an overarching hypothesis that a substantial
reduction of Scn2a expression results in increased neuronal excitability related to K channel downregulation,
hypersynchronization of in vivo firing, and elevated seizure susceptibility that can be reversed by targeted genetic
interventions. We will test our hypothesis at the cellular, circuit, and in vivo levels. In Aim 1, we will assess ex
vivo neuronal excitability of Scn2a-deficient mice. In Aim 2, we will determine in vivo neuronal firings and seizure
susceptibility of the Scn2a-deficient mice. In Aim 3, we will test targeted genetic interventions. Our study is
significant in the following ways: i) SCN2A deficiency is among the leading monogenetic forms of ASD and
seizure comorbidity occurs in about 30% of affected ASD patients; ii) The finding that severe SCN2A deficiency
resulting in hyperexcitability is potentially paradigm-shifting, and the study of which could reveal key insights
regarding seizure comorbidity associated with ASD; and iii) Targeted genetic interventions to be evaluated have
clear translational relevance. Our study has the following innovations: i) the use of novel Scn2a deficient mice
that reveal unexpected finding of neuronal hyperexcitability; ii) innovative ways to achieve genetic rescue; and
iii) the use of cutting-edge technologies including high-density Neuropixels recordings. The applicant is an early
stage investigator (ESI), whose team has extensive expertise in sodium channel physiology, genetics,
electrophysiology, and pharmacology. The team is well suited to carry out the proposed work to its full completion
within the project timeframe, and generate impactful outcomes to advance the field."

The huge breadth and depth of data and knowledge deﬁned by the genome sequence of an organism, and by
large numbers of other experimental ﬁndings for the organism, requires a database (DB) as a central repository
for information about the genome, the biochemical network, and the regulatory processes of that organism. The
Pathway Tools software is a robust and comprehensive system for constructing such organism-speciﬁc DBs. Path-
way Tools enables communities of scientists to create, query, visualize, and analyze organism DBs, and to publish
such DBs on the web. The software supports construction of organism DBs that combine a large number of bioin-
formatics datatypes, including genome maps, genes, operons, RNAs, proteins, chemical compounds, biochemical
reactions, metabolic pathways, and regulatory interactions. Pathway Tools further enables inference of qualitative
metabolic reconstructions from sequenced genomes, and the creation of quantitative metabolic ﬂux models from
those reconstructions. Such metabolic models enable computational predictions of which genes and reactions
within the metabolic network are essential, thus facilitating the design of drugs against disease-causing bacteria.
 We propose to research several new inference algorithms that derive new information for a sequenced
pathogen genome for inclusion in Pathway Tools DBs. One algorithm will detect cross-feeding and cofactor-
exchange relationships within a community of organisms to advance mechanistic understanding of the human
microbiome. A second algorithm will enable rapid communication of the biochemical machinery of an organism
encoded in its genome to scientists, such as during a disease outbreak. A third algorithm will improve the pre-
diction of operons within bacterial genomes based on new features including RNA-seq data. We also propose to
implement a suite of cloud-based editing tools for Pathway Tools databases that execute within the user's web
browser. These editing tools will enable communities of scientists to work together to update and share knowl-
edge about a given genome.
 Pathway Tools is a mature and production-grade software environment that 10,800 research groups around the
world have licensed, and it has been cited 1,650 times. We propose to maintain the software, such as by installing
new versions of its many components, and to support its user community through training, documentation, and
bug ﬁxing."

There are fundamental gaps in our understanding of DDX3X syndrome, a genetic condition accounting for up
to 2% of intellectual disability (ID) in females and caused by mutations in the X-linked gene DDX3X. Most
affected individuals are females with DDX3X haploinsufficiency. A recent study using cell models and in utero
manipulations in mouse has shown that Ddx3x regulates cortical neurogenesis and mRNA translation in
neuronal progenitors. Yet, the lack of a mouse model with construct validity for DDX3X syndrome has impeded
to faithfully capture the molecular and cellular determinants of the cognitive, social and motor deficits observed
in individuals with DDX3X syndrome. There is a critical need to fill these gaps because, until we do so,
understanding DDX3X syndrome and developing effective therapeutics remain out of reach. To address this
unmet need, a mouse modeling DDX3X haploinsufficiency (Ddx3x+/-) was generated in our laboratory. The
long-term goal is to unravel the pathophysiology of ID and identify targets for therapeutics. The overall
objective is to capture the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying DDX3X syndrome. The central
hypothesis is that Ddx3x dictates the formation of cortical projection neurons subserving cognitive, social, and
motor functions, and does so by regulating mRNA translation in the developing cortex. The rationale is that,
once we identify the mechanisms of DDX3X syndrome and reliable phenotypes in the mouse model,
therapeutics can be developed and tested. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims: 1)
Assess the neurodevelopmental defects in a mouse model of DDX3X syndrome; 2) Capture the molecular
defects in a mouse model of DDX3X syndrome; and, 3) Correlate cellular function to behavioral outcomes in
Ddx3x mutant mice. Under Aim 1, the developmental and adult cognitive, social, and motor behavior of
Ddx3x+/- mice will be measured with a standardized behavioral battery. Cortical projection neurons will be
studied in Ddx3x+/- mice by combining cellular and in vivo (e.g., in utero electroporation) approaches. Under
Aim 2, Ddx3x targets in projection neurons will be mapped using the translating ribosome affinity purification
(TRAP) method for discovery and its viral-based development (vTRAP) for independent validation. Under Aim
3, conditional Ddx3x mice with the gene ablated in the forebrain or in specific cortical layers will be tested for
development and adult behavior. The proposal is innovative because it addresses the neurobiology of a largely
unknown ID gene and characterizes the first mouse model of DDX3X syndrome. It is also innovative because it
bridges genetics, biochemistry, molecular and cellular neuroscience, developmental biology, and behavioral
neuroscience. The application is significant because it will advance our understanding of ID pathophysiology,
while shedding new light on corticogenesis, a fundamental process for brain functioning. These results are
expected to have a positive impact because they will pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions for ID."

cryo-EM
Knowledge of the structure of macromolecules, i.e. how the atoms are arranged in space and also how
they change shape over time or in response to external factors, is necessary to understand their
function. This information is also routinely exploited to aid in the development of new therapeutics.
Crystallography and electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) are powerful methods for determining three-
dimensional macromolecular structures. Of the 160,000+ 3D structures available at the Protein Data
Bank more than 150,000 have been arrived at using either crystallographic or cryo-EM methods. In
both cases, the analysis of the experimental data is a computationally complex problem that relies on
sophisticated software. Phenix is a software suite that uses reduced data from X-ray diffraction,
electron diffraction, neutron diffraction or cryo-EM 3D reconstructions to determine macromolecular
structures and has become widely used over the past 15 years. The Phenix software and associated
activities such as outreach and training have become a national and international resource.
Based on an analysis of publications, patents, and wwPDB depositions we observe that Phenix
resource is of high impact and this is growing, as measured by increasing researcher demand and use.
Phenix also plays a very significant role in supporting NIH funded research within the US. Therefore,
we formally establish the Phenix Resource, which will: a) support the continued maintenance and
optimization the code base to ensure that it keeps pace with current computing paradigms and scientific
data standards, b) improve program usability and integration with other community software resources,
c) maintain the software and hardware infrastructure for broad, efficient dissemination of the resource,
and d) undertake outreach, training and user support to help grow the community of trained
researchers who can make best use of the Phenix software."

The biomedical sciences are drowning in big data. Progress in ﬁelds such
as genomics and medical imaging is being stymied by the lack of ap-
propriate computational tools. This grant promotes the development of
algorithms, statistical methods, and software for the analysis of the big
datasets encountered in the biomedical sciences. The NIH All of Us Pro-
gram, the Million Veteran Project (MVP) sponsored by US Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA), and the UK Biobank are three prime examples of
recent massive datasets. These datasets require terabytes of storage on
sample sizes ranging from 105 to 106 and above subjects. The datasets
are also dynamic, growing over time in size and complexity. In addition,
the datasets are heterogeneous; for example, the UK Biobank offers ge-
nomic data, electronic health record (EHR) data, and imaging data on the
same study individuals. Finally, as with most real-world data, the data are
fraught with missingness and inaccuracy.
 We propose attacking the issues of parameter estimation and model
selection raised by such massive datasets. We will be guided by princi-
ples of parsimony and high-dimensional optimization. Most of the speciﬁc
applications we have in mind involve imaging and genomics, particularly
genomewide association discovery. Fortunately, most of the tools and soft-
ware we construct will be more generically useful. Our successful algo-
rithms will be coded in the modern scientiﬁc programming language Julia
and posted on publicly available websites. We will focus on constrained
and sparse regression, EM and MM algorithms for optimization, variance
components models, bootstrapping of linear mixed models, a copula-like
model for correlated data, and sensitivity analysis in epidemic models.
These are all subjects of paramount importance in modern genomics, bio-
statistics and data mining."
10813825,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Asthma is an immune-mediated disorder, and early life allergic sensitization (T2 inflammation) and
respiratory illnesses are the most common precursors to the development of lifelong asthma. With over 300
million patients affected worldwide, asthma is a significant health care burden and a lifelong illness for most
individuals. New information is needed to design preventive treatments, and answers may come from studying
children who grow up in farming or traditional agrarian (TA) environments, who have intense and unique microbial
exposures and are much less likely to develop allergic diseases and asthma. We hypothesize that TA microbial
exposures and colonization promote immune development and airway epithelial cell functions to reduce
the risks of respiratory illnesses, allergies and asthma.
 To test this hypothesis, we started the Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (WISC) in 2013 and added a cohort of
TA families in 2018 to determine mechanisms for protection against allergic diseases and asthma. We find that
Wisconsin farm children have distinct gastrointestinal and nasopharyngeal microbiome features and unique gene
expression patterns in nasal airway epithelial cells at age 2 years. These findings correspond with lower rates of
atopic dermatitis, often a precursor to asthma and respiratory illnesses. The differences in immune and microbial
signatures are even more pronounced in TA children. The microbiota in TA children's stool and nasal secretions
are enriched for commensals that may promote immune development and reduce rates of allergic diseases and
respiratory illnesses. Notably, the bacterial species identified in the TA samples contain genes distinct from those
found in samples from the farm and non-farm children. We therefore propose that TA bacteria of the GI tract and
airways and their metabolites are mediators of protection from allergic diseases and will be a rich source to
determine the mechanistic pathways that promote health.
 To test our overall hypothesis, we propose three highly interactive projects. Project I will determine how TA
children differ in immune development, nasal airway epithelial cell profiles, and clinical outcomes related to
respiratory illnesses and allergic diseases. Project II will evaluate how TA children's distinct microbiota and
their metabolites relate to their unique patterns of immune development and the resulting clinical outcomes.
Project III will use in vitro models of airway epithelial cells to determine the mechanisms of TA microbial
metabolites that inhibit viral and bacterial pathogens and modify the immune and inflammatory responses of
airway epithelial cells."

COPII mediated ER-to-golgi membrane traffic was first reconstituted using crude cell extracts thirty years
ago. Twenty years ago, the formation of COPII vesicles was recapitulated using pure proteins and lipids.
However, the consumption of COPII vesicles – their uncoating, tethering, docking, and fusion with accep-
tor compartments, is still poorly understood. This is in large measure because the crude transport assay
developed thirty years ago has not been supplanted by a system employing chemically defined components.
In this Project we introduce such a system and use it to test hypotheses about the sequence of biochemical
subreactions in COPII vesicle traffic, the components that execute these subreactions, and the mechanisms
through which they function."
10814874,"Abstract (Project Summary)
We propose to parse the clinical heterogeneity of psychotic disorders by studying the evolution of hippocampal
dysfunction in the early stage of psychosis (ESOP).
 Smaller hippocampal volume is one of the most significant brain abnormalities in chronic schizophrenia, but is
less pronounced in prodromal and early stages of psychosis. In contrast, hyperactivity of the anterior
hippocampus has been observed in both early and chronic stages of psychosis. Clinical and preclinical studies
have identified excitation/inhibition imbalance as a plausible mechanism for hippocampal hyperactivity in
psychosis. Clarifying the timing and mechanism of hippocampal dysfunction will improve our ability to intervene
and prevent the progression from early psychosis to schizophrenia.
 We propose to study 2 ESOP cohorts. ESOP-1 will be a new cohort of acutely ill psychotic patients who meet
DSM-5 criteria A for schizophrenia for at least one month, but not more than 2 years (i.e., schizophreniform
disorder or early schizophrenia). We expect that, at the end of the study, 2/3 of the ESOP-1 cohort will have
progressed to schizophrenia, while the remaining 1/3 will be diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder. ESOP-
2 is a well-characterized sample of schizophrenia patients, who have participated in repeated assessments
during the first two years of their illness. From ESOP-1 we will recruit 30 patients and 30 healthy control subjects
for the restoration of hippocampal excitation/inhibition balance.
 We predict that the hippocampus is hyperactive in the ESOP-1 cohort, resulting in perturbations of relational,
hippocampal-based memory. We expect to find structural changes of the anterior hippocampus only in those
ESOP persons who will progress to schizophrenia. In the ESOP-2 cohort, we predict progressive hippocampal
volume loss, advancing from the anterior to the posterior region, resulting in more significant memory deficits.
We predict that restoring normal excitation/inhibition balance will improve hippocampal function in ESOP
persons.
 To test our hypotheses, we will collect high-density, multi-dimensional assessments of psychosis. We will use
high-resolution parcellation protocols of the hippocampus and functional imaging of resting-state and task-based
activation. We will use single dose administration of levetiracetam, an anti-epileptic drug, to modulate
excitation/inhibition balance.
 The proposed combination of longitudinal and pharmacological imaging will allow us to study the timing and
mechanism of hippocampal dysfunction in psychotic disorders. The integration of these approaches aims to
establish a staging model of psychotic disorders, with the ultimate goal to aid early detection, prevention and
treatment."
10813154,"Summary: Geographic variation in model for end stage liver disease (MELD) scores at transplant across
donation service areas has fueled a major policy debate over allocation of donor livers. An important caveat to
this perceived disparity is the focus on allocation MELD, in which patients with lower calculated MELD scores
may be assigned a higher score if their calculated MELD is thought to underestimate the risk of waitlist
mortality. Analysis of calculated MELD at transplant demonstrates much less variation between regions. Some
high allocation MELD regions actually have low calculated MELD scores relative to the rest of the country. The
different pictures painted by allocation versus calculated MELD scores highlight the critical role MELD
exception points play in geographic differences in access to transplantation. A national liver review board was
recently implemented to impose national standardization of MELD exception scores in an effort to mitigate
geographic disparity. A potential flaw in this strategy is the assumption that the risk of mortality associated with
a given MELD score or exception diagnosis is the same across geographic areas. We know that social
determinants of health and access to care vary widely across the country, however, and that these differences
have a significant impact on health outcomes. Imposing a geographically uniform MELD exception scoring
policy that does not account for these important differences may have the unintended effect of overestimating
the risk of waitlist mortality for exception patients in some regions while underestimating that risk in others, thus
worsening geographic disparity rather than mitigating it. I hypothesize that significant geographic variation
exists in the prevalence and appropriateness of MELD exceptions scores at the county level, and that
appropriate adjustment to MELD exception scores based on a candidate’s location will mitigate geographic
disparity in liver transplant waitlist mortality. Despite abundant literature on geographic disparity in liver
transplantation, few studies actually apply formal geospatial analysis to geographically based questions facing
the field. I propose to utilize such techniques to accomplish the following unique aims: (1) determine the
prevalence and appropriateness of MELD exceptions on a county level and diagnose the presence of
geographic clusters where these exceptions provide an inappropriate advantage to transplant candidates with
MELD exception scores; (2) determine adjusted MELD exception scores which would equalize waitlist mortality
risk between exception and non-exception patients in each geographic area; and (3) simulate waitlist outcomes
under an alternative allocation scenario where MELD exception points are assigned according to geographic
region as determined in Aim 2. This study will provide a more granular and personalized approach to the
estimation of waitlist mortality. The mentoring and training afforded by this award will foster my growth as an
investigator by allowing me to focus on building an expertise in geospatial analysis and advanced simulation,
advancing my long-term career goal of research independence as a surgeon-scientist with R01 funding."

Traumatic social experience in humans can impair brain reward function leading to severe social avoidance.
Rodent stress models such as chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), can also cause severe social-avoidance
mediated, in part, through altered reward circuit function. One of the prominent questions arising from such
rodent studies is whether such social avoidance behaviors occurs due to a loss of social reward or preference.
Using a standard CSDS model, we measured social interaction with threatening (aggressive CD-1 mice) and
non-threatening (same sex 3-week old juvenile C57BL6/J mice) social target mice. We find that CSDS leads to
social avoidance to both threatening and non-threatening social targets in a subset of male and female mice
termed susceptible. Control and resilient mice do not exhibit social avoidance to either target mouse. To
measure social reward, we utilized a social conditioned place preference (CPP) assay, where experimental mice
were conditioned with a same sex 3-week old juvenile C57BL6/J. We find that that CSDS impairs formation of
social CPP in susceptible, but not resilient, male and female mice. We next used whole brain iDisco clearing and
c-Fos mapping following juvenile social interaction in CSDS-exposed mice and found several brain regions with
increased c-Fos expression specifically in susceptible mice. The lateral septum (LS)—a stress responsive brain
region—was highly activated in susceptible mice, but not resilient or control mice. We performed in situ
hybridization to identify specific cell types in the LS and found a neurotensin (LSNT) positive GABAergic
population activated during juvenile social interaction only in susceptible mice. We next utilized in vivo fiber
photometry and GCAMP6-mediated Ca2+ imaging along with and chemogenetics to confirm that LSNT neurons
are activated in real-time during juvenile social interaction and they regulate social avoidance and social CPP.
To determine downstream LSNT connections, we used predicted correlation matrices from iDisco c-Fos
expression maps to identify functionally connected regions and then confirmed these connections with viral
tracing tools and optogenetics. We found a functional connection between LSNT neurons and the nucleus
accumbens shell/nucleus of the diagonal band that regulates social interaction. Our research provides a circuit-
level framework to understanding deficits in social behavior, that are common among many stress-related
illnesses, such as depression."
10817134,"Abstract. The cognitive impairments that occur after a concussion (or mild TBI) can be long-lasting, and can
interfere with every day activities. These deficits, especially memory dysfunction, are often due to perturbations
of hippocampal function. In vivo recordings of neural activity in behaving animals have demonstrated that the
firing of a subset of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus increases when an animal moves through its
environment. These cells, referred to as “place cells”, display localized firing patterns (i.e. place fields) that the
animal uses to recognize an environment. Thus, a failure to form stable place fields has been linked to learning
and memory dysfunction. Evidence has shown that theta oscillations (a rhythmic firing pattern seen in the
hippocampus) play an important role in modulating place field stability, and in learning and memory. This rhythm
is established by connections between inhibitory neurons present in the medial septum and the hippocampus.
We present supportive results to indicate that the number of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons in the
CA1 subfield of the hippocampus is decreased after a fluid percussion injury (FPI), an effect that occurs in the
absence of overt loss of pyramidal neurons. Associated with this loss, electrophysiological recordings revealed
a decrease in theta power and place cell instability that are evident for weeks after brain injury. The transcription
factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is phosphorylated and increases neuroplasticity-related
gene expression following phosphorylation by specific protein kinases, and has been shown to be critical for
place cell stability. Based on these results, we propose to test the hypothesis that stimulation of hippocampal
CA1 pyramidal neurons at theta frequency or pharmacological potentiation of CREB will increase place cell
function and improve memory formation in the chronic stage of FPI. The results from these proposed studies
will reveal the neural basis for memory dysfunction and potential pharmacological strategy to restore neural
function and improve learning and memory during subacute/chronic stage of traumatic brain injury."

Antiretroviral agents reduce morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals; however, mutations in the viral
genome often result in clinical resistance to their effects. Due to the random nature of the mutations, the
emergence of therapy-resistant mutants is mostly considered unpredictable. Consequently, antiviral treatment
strategies are mainly empiric. The premise of this proposal is that the emergence rate of therapy-resistant
mutants in each patient is largely predictable. Our published and preliminary studies suggest that changes in
virus proteins can be accurately forecasted based their sequence properties before initiation of treatment. In
the proposed study, we will use the example of the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs). Several broadly
neutralizing antibody (BNAb) therapeutics that target Env have shown great promise in clinical trials. However,
escape from these agents often occurs after treatment, at different rates for different patients. The goal of this
work is to advance our ability to personalize BNAb therapeutics to people living with HIV, by establishing the
tools to determine the likelihood of each patient to develop resistance to each agent.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that each swarm of HIV-1 that infects a patient has an inherent and
measurable likelihood to escape from each therapeutic. This likelihood is shared by the viruses that circulate in
the blood and the reservoir of latent viruses, which is often the source of resistant mutants that emerge after
therapy.
To test the above hypothesis, we will first determine if the rate of HIV-1 escape from BNAbs is specific for each
swarm of the virus that infects a patient. To this end, we will test in vitro the escape of strains from different
patients that were isolated from samples collected at different time points. We will then test the ability of our
models to forecast the rate and site of escape for each strain. Based on these studies, our models will be
refined and applied to determine their ability to forecast resistance rates in four clinical trials of BNAbs in
humans. Next, we will determine whether the appearance of resistant mutants is driven by their fitness (i.e.,
higher likelihood to appear before treatment) or by their resistance (i.e., higher replicative capacity after
treatment). Such knowledge is critical for our ability to use patient samples before treatment, which inform of
the viral fitness profiles, to predict escape from the treatment. We will then examine whether the fitness profile
of BNAb escape sites is a persistent property of each virus swarm by measuring the changes that occur over
time in patients. Finally, we will induce outgrowth of latent HIV-1 from peripheral blood cells and compare their
fitness profiles at BNAb escape sites with those of viruses that circulate in the blood.
The models to be developed have the potential to make important contributions to the treatment of patients by
antiviral agents. They will lay the foundations for personalized antiviral medicine that is based on the likelihood
of each virus swarm in a patient to develop resistance to each agent."
10884188,"The innate immune system detects pathogen-derived molecules to prevent infections via specialized immune
receptors. The immune receptors include cell surface-resident pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in mammals and receptor kinases (RKs) in plants, and intracellular NOD-like
receptors (NLRs) in plants and mammals. Plant PRRs detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs), whereas NLRs recognize pathogen-specific effectors, culminating in a unified immune
system. How the signaling networks underlying PRR- and NLR-mediated immunity are interconnected remains
largely unknown. In addition, defects or over-activation of immune receptors could lead to cell death or
autoimmunity. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that enable or constrain PRR and NLR activation for
maintaining immune homeostasis is particularly important. The PI’s laboratory has developed a series of
sensitive and high-throughput genetic screens to dissect the complex activation and signaling mechanisms in
plant immunity, and revealed the importance of malectin-like RKs (MLRs) as a molecular module at the plasma
membrane linking PRR and NLR immune receptors. PI’s long-term goal is to elucidate the signaling networks
regulating innate immune responses using Arabidopsis as a model system and expand the knowledge of how
hosts fend off infections without causing autoimmune disorders. The proposed research rooted in PI’s previous
discoveries and preliminary studies will support a series of projects that address several critical knowledge
gaps in two interrelated research areas. First, the research will elucidate how the PRR- and NLR-mediated
signaling pathways converge into an interconnected and balanced immune response. Specifically, the projects
will mechanistically address how a PRR-activated MAP kinase cascade regulates NLR-mediated immune
homeostasis through MLRs perceiving different peptide ligands. Second, the research will decipher the
immune gene orchestration through the combinatorial action of the layered transcriptional, posttranscriptional,
and posttranslational regulations at the single-cell level. The projects will focus on how intertwined
posttranslational modifications, including ADP-ribosylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation, regulate
immune-specific gene transcription, stability, and translation. The proposed interdisciplinary research will
provide ample training opportunities for diverse undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.

HIV remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality despite great progress in HIV prevention and treatment,
especially for key populations (KPs), including men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women
(TGW). Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown effective in reducing HIV acquisition among different
populations when implemented as part of a combination prevention strategy. However, effectiveness of PrEP
decreases with suboptimal retention and adherence. While many efforts have been made to assess adherence
to PrEP and its associations with HIV prevention effectiveness, more research is needed to deepen our
understanding of individual-level facilitators and barriers to retention in care and adherence to PrEP. Machine
learning holds promise to address those effectively due to its ability to model complex non-linear relationships
among many interacting factors without relying on modeling assumptions, and recent advances in deep
learning have resulted in exciting results for a variety of clinical prediction applications. Although machine
learning has been applied to identify potential PrEP candidates, little is done in exploring machine learning,
especially advanced deep learning techniques, to assess predictive factors for retention in PrEP care and
effective PrEP use.
 To close gaps in knowledge, the proposed study aims to explore advanced machine learning techniques to
identify protective and risk factors for retention in PrEP care and effective PrEP use among key populations in
Thailand. We will perform descriptive statistical analysis to characterize PrEP use patterns among MSM and
TGW (Aim 1); develop deep learning models to predict loss to follow up in PrEP care and effective PrEP use
(Aim 2); and design an explainable risk scoring system for identifying clients at high risk of discontinuation and
non-effective PrEP use, with interpretable reasoning logic and associated demographic, behavioral, social, and
clinical factors (Aim 3).
 This study is responsive to NIMH’s priority research in HIV prevention and strategic goal 3.2 to develop
strategies for tailoring existing interventions to optimize outcomes. The findings from this study and the
prediction-model based scoring system will inform tailored interventions to optimize PrEP engagement and
facilitate differentiated PrEP service delivery, paving a solid foundation for precise HIV prevention using PrEP
as an effective strategy."

Serial assessment of the main organ of longitudinal skeletal growth, the growth plate or physis, with a novel
MR technique, diffusion tensor imaging of the physis and metaphysis (DTI-P/M), can improve clinical decision
making for conditions that lead to short stature in children. Treatment of short stature using growth hormone
(GH) therapy leads to healthcare costs that can rise to $11 billion per year. Assessing response to GH requires
determination of height velocity, which currently relies on insensitive external measurements of length or
stature and requires height measurements at least 1 year apart. Predicting growth potential, crucial to
identifying who will benefit from growth-enhancing treatment, is currently estimated by assessing physeal
changes on the hand that only indirectly reflect those of the knee, where most skeletal growth occurs. This
proposal addresses an unmet clinical need for a better tool to determine height velocity and predict growth
potential. We have pioneered DTI-P/M of the knee, a technique that generates tracts based on anisotropic
diffusion of water through the physeal and metaphyseal columns, to measure tract volume, tract length, and
fractional anisotropy (FA), a marker of tissue organization. Our proposal overcomes current gaps in knowledge
regarding DTI-P/M measurements over time and in response to GH. Our specific aims will test the central
hypothesis that DTI-P/M of the distal femur can be established as a diagnostic and predictive tool for height
velocity, growth potential and GH response: Aim 1) Predict height velocity using DTI-P/M parameters during
the adolescent growth spurt in 60 children; Aim 2) Predict growth potential during cessation of adolescent
growth in 40 children; and Aim 3) Assess response to GH therapy based on early changes in DTI-P/M
parameters by analyzing tract volume and length and FA in 50 children prior to initiation of GH therapy and at
4, 8, and 12 month clinical follow-ups. Achieving these aims will validate DTI-P/M as a tool for precision
therapy with growth enhancing medications and improved timing of orthopedic procedures."

Heterocycles are ubiquitous components of pharmaceutical drugs essential for human
health. A particularly attractive approach to nitrogen containing heterocycles is the
modification of cheap and readily available amines via C–H bond functionalization.
However, methods that efficiently accomplish this task typically require the use of
expensive transition metal catalysts and/or oxidants. This proposal is focused on the
design and development of efficient and practical methods for amine functionalization,
including the development of asymmetric variants. The main goal is the alpha-
functionalization of amines through conceptually new and underdeveloped methods of
substrate activation. Unique methods for the synthesis of heterocycles will also be
explored in the context of asymmetric Lewis and BrØnsted acid catalysis. In addition to
targeting the rapid preparation of compounds related to structures with known biological
activities, efforts will center on the development of particularly powerful reactions that
rapidly produce new polycyclic heterocycles. A priority is the generation of new
structural frameworks that are absent from current drug discovery screening libraries."

 Recent studies have shown that population mixture (or `admixture') is pervasive throughout human
evolution and has played a major role in shaping human genetic and phenotypic variation. Despite the
ubiquity and importance of population mixture, we still lack adequate methods to characterize the impact
of admixture on a genomic scale and leverage this information for effective gene mapping. Addressing
these topics is the central focus of research in my lab. In this proposal, our goal is to develop new methods to
reconstruct fine-scale genomic ancestry in admixed groups and leverage this information to identify novel
disease and adaptive mutations and genes. The application of these methods to large genomic surveys will
help to discover novel disease and adaptive variants.
 The first step in characterizing the genomic impact of admixture is to infer the ancestry of each
chromosomal segment, referred to as local ancestry. Towards this goal, we are developing new methods for
local ancestry inference using machine-learning approaches that are ideally suited for classification problems
and computationally tractable for large datasets. Our preliminary results show that our method is highly
accurate and applicable across a range of demographic models. With reliable local ancestry inference, we will
be well placed to study the impact of admixture on disease architecture and evolution of complex traits. We
propose to use Admixture Mapping, a method to identify disease associations by leveraging ancestry
differences across the genome, between cases and controls or among cases alone. By applying Admixture
Mapping to complex admixed groups like South Asians and Latinxs, we aim to discover new population-
specific disease associations and advance our understanding of disease architecture. Further, we will develop
a novel method to leverage the demographic history of admixed groups to identify adaptive variants. By
applying the method to study selection at various timescales in human evolution, we will uncover candidate
genes and pathways related to adaptive gene flow and characterize its role in shaping human genetic
variation. Finally, we will build reference-free ancestral genomes by recovering chromosomal segments of
our lost ancestors hidden in admixed genomes. We will use these genomes to reconstruct the demographic
history of our ancestors, as well as understand the fitness effects of population mixtures and the phenotypic
legacy of our extinct ancestors.
 The successful completion of the proposed project will provide new statistical tools to leverage patterns
of admixture to perform effective disease mapping and evolutionary inference in diverse, admixed groups.
Application of these methods to large-scale genomic datasets will provide insights into the genetic,
evolutionary, and functional impact of admixture during human evolution. Algorithms proposed here will be
implemented in freely available software for use by other researchers."

The growing abundance of population genomic data creates a critical need for inference approaches that can
reveal evolutionary history. The PI's long-term goal is to understand how natural selection shapes the evolution
and function of the molecular networks that comprise life. Toward that goal, the PI's group develops and applies
methods for inferring the evolutionary past from population genomic data. The objectives of this application are to
understand how context affects mutation ﬁtness effects, to develop improved inference methods, and to support
the population genomics research community. The rationale is that this research program will both reveal new
insights into evolution and enhance the ability of colleagues to reveal complementary insights.
The PI's research group has expanded the concept of a distribution of ﬁtness effects to multiple dimensions,
focusing on differences in mutation ﬁtness effects among populations. The PI proposes to apply this approach to
numerous systems, to elucidate the relative roles of genetic and environmental context in creating differences in
ﬁtness effects. The group will also extend this approach to consider differences in ﬁtness effects over time.
The PI developed and maintains the software dadi, among the most popular approaches for ﬁtting population
genomic models to data. The PI will continue to support and enhance dadi, while developing complementary
inference approaches. These will include new diffusion methods based on pairs of loci and the linkage among
them and a novel deep learning approach for inferring the distribution of ﬁtness effects.
The PI helped found the PopSim consortium, which aims to expand the rigor and transparency of population ge-
nomic models for the scientiﬁc community. The PI's group will continue to be active in the consortium, particularly
leading a new initiative to facilitate rigorous testing of population genomic methods via open competition.
The proposed research program is innovative both conceptually and methodologically. The novel concept of a
multidimensional distribution of ﬁtness effects has many applications, and the group will develop novel method-
ology for several population genomics inferences. The expected outcomes of the proposed research are new
insights into the ecology and biology of mutation ﬁtness effects, new population genomic inference tools, and a
framework for blinded evaluation of such tools. These outcomes are expected to have important positive impact
on the ﬁled of population genomics. The methods will be widely applicable and well-supported, and the inferences
will feed into approaches for inferring the evolutionary past and predicting the evolutionary future."

Mitochondria are best known as the “powerhouses” of the cell, due to their predominant role in generating
cellular energy through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS). Beyond energy generation, these essential organelles also play central roles in apoptosis,
calcium handing, innate immunity, cell signaling, and iron-sulfur cluster assembly. Human health therefore
depends critically on mitochondrial function. The research program proposed here seeks to understand
three homeostatic mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial health. The first mechanism is mitochondrial
fusion and fission dynamics. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles whose physiology is regulated by the
balance between the opposing processes of membrane fusion and fission. Second, the quality of the
mitochondrial population is maintained by selective degradation of excessive or defective mitochondria
through mitophagy, the autophagic pathway that shuttles mitochondria to the lysosome for destruction.
Finally, mitochondrial quantity and function are regulated by biogenesis programs that control expression of
mitochondrial genes, ensuring that appropriate levels of mitochondria are maintained in response to a
specific cellular state. This research project targets key gaps in knowledge in each of these fundamental
homeostatic mechanisms. For mitochondrial fusion and fission, we are using mouse genetics and cell
biology to understand how mitochondrial dynamics regulates mitochondrial function. The least understood
of the core mitochondrial dynamics genes is Fis1. We have found that Fis1 plays essential functions in
neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. We are pinpointing the cellular
functions of Fis1 and determining which function is responsible for the in vivo phenotypes. Our preliminary
data suggest that Fis1 serves as a link between mitochondria and the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, we are
determining the elusive mechanism through which the balance between fusion and fission is regulated.
There is evidence that each fusion event is coupled to a future fission event, and we will determine the
molecular mechanism of this coupling. To study mitochondrial degradation, we are performing whole-
genome CRISPR interference screens and have discovered the integrated stress response as a key
regulator of mitophagy. We will elucidate the molecular mechanism through which this cell stress pathway
tunes the level of mitophagy. Finally, we are using CRISPR interference screens to identify how
mitochondrial density and function are regulated. These studies have identified two chromatin remodeling
complexes as critical for mitochondrial function. By determining how these chromatin remodeling complexes
regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through control of gene expression, we will gain insight into how cells
dynamically adjust mitochondrial density to fit cellular demands. All together, these studies will provide a
comprehensive understanding of how mitochondrial health in cells is maintained."

All populations are genetically variable, and humans, as well as the populations of somatic cells in their bodies,
are no exception. Genetic variation explains much of phenotype variation and partially determines the risk of
common and rare disease. Analysis of the functional effects of allelic variants opens a unique perspective on
molecular function in the broad organismal context. Study of genetic variation provides understanding of the
actions of evolution over short timescales and helps detect footprints of natural selection that point to
uncharacterized functional elements of the genome. The explosion of sequencing datasets in combination with
new computational and statistical techniques, propel genetic variation research. Our lab plans to be at the
forefront of this endeavor. Our broad research program will analyze genetic variation from multiple angles. We
will study mutagenesis as the origin of genetic variation, and use statistical analysis—in the context of known
DNA replication and repair biology—to infer mutagenic mechanisms. We will develop computational methods
to analyze and predict the effect of human allelic variants on molecular function. We will also study the
evolutionary forces governing the fate of alleles in populations, in order to better understand the persistence of
deleterious variation. Additionally, we will examine the principles of the relationship between genotype and
phenotype, including both polygenic inheritance and the partial penetrance of rare disease variants. These
topics—the origins, persistence, and effects of variants—are intertwined, and their integrated understanding is
critical to the progress of human medical genetics and cancer genomics."

Circadian clocks throughout the body drive rhythmic expression of thousands of genes, resulting in
rhythms in biochemistry, physiology and behavior. Disruption of circadian clocks through genetics or
environmental perturbations such as jet lag or shift-work, can have profound negative consequences
and has been linked to obesity, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and mental illness. In
particular, circadian clocks exert control over nearly every major metabolic pathway, allowing optimal
utilization of typically cyclic availability of nutrients. Our work is focused generally on
understanding the detailed molecular mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock
machinery and the mechanisms by which these clocks control rhythmic metabolism.
According to the current model, the core part of this clock mechanism is a negative feedback loop
whereby the transcription factor heterodimer CLOCK/BMAL1 drives transcription of the “clock”
proteins PERIOD (PER) 1, PER 2, CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) 1 and CRY 2 which interact with each
other to repress the activity of CLOCK/BMAL1, and thus their own synthesis. This same
transcriptional mechanism also drives rhythmic expression of many so called “clock-controlled genes”
that ultimately result in the many output rhythms in tissues throughout the body. One of these clock-
controlled genes is Nocturnin, a focus of my laboratory. We have shown that loss of this gene in mice
causes resistance to diet-induced obesity, alters rhythms in cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism
and increases resistance to inflammatory challenges such as LPS. Although the Nocturnin protein is
a member of a family of RNases (the CCR4 deadenylases), we have recently demonstrated that
Nocturnin’s substrate is not RNA, but rather NADP(H). Nocturnin is an NADP(H) phosphatase,
converting NADP(H) to NAD(H). In this proposal we seek to use new mouse models that we have
developed to understand the tissue-specific role of Nocturnin and to disentangle the roles of the two
isoforms (one mitochondrial, the other primarily bound to intracellular membranes). We will also carry
out metabolomic and metabolic flux experiments to determine the effects of circadian regulation of
NADP(H) and NAD(H) levels. In addition, we will validate small molecule modulators of Nocturnin
that we have identified in a high throughput screen and will use these molecules to perturb Nocturnin
activity in cells and mice. Our work on the central mechanism of the core clock will also continue in
the proposed funding period. We have solved crystal structures for the CLOCK/BMAL1 and
CRY2/PER2 complexes and these data have allowed the identification of evolutionarily conserved
functional domains throughout the proteins and revealed additional insights into the mechanisms by
which these proteins operate and set the circadian period. Over the next five years, we will expand
on this information to determine the atomic details of how this clock keeps time."
10831035,"Summary
DNA metabolic processes including replication, repair, recombination, and telomere maintenance occur on
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). In each of these complex processes, dozens of proteins function together on the
ssDNA template. However, when double-stranded DNA is unwound, the transiently open ssDNA is protected
and coated by the high affinity heterotrimeric ssDNA binding Replication Protein A (RPA). Almost all downstream
DNA processes must first remodel/remove RPA or function alongside to access the ssDNA occluded under RPA.
Formation of RPA-ssDNA complexes trigger the DNA damage checkpoint response and is a key step in
activating most DNA repair and recombination pathways. Thus, in addition to protecting the exposed ssDNA,
RPA functions as a gatekeeper to define functional specificity in DNA maintenance and genomic integrity. The
precise mechanisms of how RPA imparts functional specificity is poorly resolved. Towards addressing this gap
in knowledge, our long-term goals are to answer the following questions: a) RPA physically interacts with over
three dozen DNA processing enzymes. How are these interactions determined, regulated, and prioritized? b)
RPA binds to ssDNA with high affinity (KD <10-10 M). How do DNA metabolic enzymes that bind to ssDNA with
hundred-fold lower affinities remove RPA? c) RPA plays a role in positioning the recruited enzymes (with
appropriate polarity) onto the DNA. What are the structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties that regulate
this process? d) How are the DNA and protein interaction activities of RPA tuned by post translational
modifications such as phosphorylation? RPA achieves functional dexterity through a multi-domained architecture
utilizing several DNA binding and protein-interaction domains connected by flexible linkers. This flexible and
modular architecture enables RPA to adopt a myriad of configurations tailored for specific DNA metabolic roles.
This dynamic plasticity has hindered structural, biochemical, and biophysical investigations of full-length RPA.
Over the past eight years, our group has developed non-canonical amino acid based site-specific fluorescence
labeling tools to investigate the dynamics of the individual domains of RPA. While difficult to accomplish, our
breakthrough enabled us to reestablish how the individual domains of RPA bound, dissociated, and remodeled
during various DNA metabolic processes. The findings were in stark contrast to commonly assumed models for
RPA function and has opened numerous avenues to finally investigate and establish how RPA functions in
specific DNA metabolic processes. For example, we showed that the commonly assumed high-affinity DNA
binding domains of RPA were in fact the most dynamic and not bound to ssDNA in the context of the full-length
protein. Utilizing our powerful biochemical, structural, and biophysical toolkit we here seek to resolve how RPA
functions in the context of nucleosomes, R-loops, telomere, and in other DNA repair pathways."

 The molecular mechanisms through which cells sense nutrients remain largely unknown, but their
elucidation is key to our understanding of metabolic regulation both in normal and disease states. At the center
of nutrient sensing and growth regulation is an ancient protein kinase known as the mechanistic Target of
Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1). In response to the combined action of metabolic inputs such as nutrients,
growth factors, energy and oxygen, mTORC1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the surface of lysosomes,
where it becomes activated. Accumulating evidence indicates that aberrant mTORC1 activation at the lysosome
could be a driving force in diseases ranging from cancer to type-2 diabetes to neurodegeneration. Thus, a deep
mechanistic understanding of how mTORC1 is activated and then inactivated in response to nutrients could point
the way to novel therapeutic strategies in these diseases. My lab has made important contributions to the
understanding of mTORC1 pathway organization, and how its function is integrated with the many activities of
the lysosome. In particular, we have identified a dedicated signaling pathway via which cholesterol, an important
building block for cellular membranes, promotes mTORC1 recruitment to the lysosome and activation of its
downstream programs. We have uncovered membrane contact sites between lysosomes and the endoplasmic
reticulum as key nodes where mTORC1 activation by cholesterol occurs, thus implicating inter-organelle
communication as an important aspect of mTORC1 regulation. Furthermore, we found that excess mTORC1
signaling, caused by cholesterol accumulation in the lysosome, drives cellular dysfunction and could be a driving
force in a neurodegenerative and metabolic disease, Niemann-Pick type C (NPC).
 These discoveries directly lead to deep questions on the organization of cellular nutrient sensing, which
are at the core of the current MIRA proposal. One key challenge is to elucidate the mechanisms and physiological
roles of lipid-dependent mTORC1 regulation, specifically whether dedicated cholesterol sensors exist in the
lysosomal membrane, and how they couple the abundance of sterol molecules to mTORC1 activation and to
overall metabolic regulation at the cell and organism level. Based on our finding that cholesterol sensing by
mTORC1 involves physical communication between the lysosome and the ER, another major goal of the
proposal is to delineate the machinery that mediates communication and metabolite exchange between the
lysosome and the ER, and how this machinery participates in regulation of mTORC1 as well as another major
metabolic kinase, protein kinase A. Finally, the pathogenic role of dysregulated mTORC1 in NPC, and the ability
of mTORC1 inhibition to restore several parameters of NPC cell function, strongly support mTORC1 as a prime
target in neurodegenerative disease. We will thus determine how lysosomal mTORC1 controls neuronal cell
homeostasis, and how dysregulated mTORC1 signaling contributes to neuronal degeneration. Together, these
studies will shed light on fundamental principles of metabolic organization in health and disease states."

Advanced maternal age (≥35 years; AMA) is a steadily increasing public health concern as a non-modifiable
risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and fetal growth restriction. These
outcomes indicate an unfavorable intrauterine environment, which can also predispose offspring to long-term
health risks such as cardiovascular disease. The effects of maternal age on the intrauterine environment and
developmental programming have only been investigated in a handful of studies, which have shown a slight
positive correlation between offspring blood pressure and maternal age in humans, with evidence of diastolic
dysfunction and poor response to ischemia in adult male rodents. Non-human primates (NHP), such as the
vervet, represent a critical preclinical model of pregnancy that closely mirrors human reproductive
anatomy/physiology and fetal development, while allowing for better control over confounders, such as diet and
environment. Using the NIH-supported Vervet Research Colony (VRC) at Wake Forest University School of
Medicine, as well as the complementary expertise of our multidisciplinary team, we are uniquely poised to
longitudinally assess the effects of maternal age on NHP pregnancy physiology and chronic cardiovascular
disease in offspring, through a combination of imaging and repeated sampling of blood and placental tissue.
We will: 1) Test the hypothesis that NHP AMA pregnancies demonstrate poor maternal cardiovascular
adaptation to pregnancy in the form of cardiac diastolic dysfunction using serial echocardiography, blood
pressure measurement, and maternal blood biomarker analysis throughout pregnancy in vervets at AMA (11-
14y) and young maternal age (YMA, 5-8y). 2) Test the hypothesis that NHP AMA placentas have evidence of
decreased microvascular perfusion using serial contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging throughout pregnancy,
in addition to standard Doppler measurements of uterine/umbilical flow, assessment of fetal growth and
survival, and histologic evaluation of placental biopsies throughout pregnancy. 3) Test the hypothesis that adult
offspring from NHP AMA pregnancies show evidence of diastolic dysfunction and increased myocardial fibrosis
compared to YMA offspring using current 7- to 9-year-old adult vervets and cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging techniques to quantify the extracellular volume fraction, a non-invasive measure of myocardial fibrosis.
Additionally, we will use echocardiography to quantify diastolic function, measure circulating biomarkers of
cardiac strain and remodeling, and interrogate a possible mechanism for developmental programming by
measuring components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These studies will be among the first to
investigate how AMA affects placental function and developmental programming of cardiovascular disease in a
clinically relevant NHP model. Understanding the pathophysiological changes that occur in both mothers and
offspring from AMA pregnancies is necessary to identify therapeutic targets and critical windows for
intervention that can prevent or delay the onset of cardiovascular disease."
10909817,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 1%-3% of the general
population, with greater prevalence in older persons (8%-10%). AF is associated with an increased risk for
cognitive decline, dementia, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and mortality,
resulting in an incremental yearly cost of AF in the US of $26 billion. AF and cognitive decline share several risk
factors including advancing age and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure.
Microbleeds from anticoagulation, a proinflammatory and prothrombotic state, and cerebral hypoperfusion can
cumulatively result in silent cerebral infarction, white matter hyperintensities, brain atrophy, and disruption of
functional network connectivity, and also lead to AF-related cognitive decline. While the link between AF and the
development of cognitive impairment has been established, the driving mechanisms and the effect of sinus
rhythm restoration are not completely understood.
 Our long-term goals are to understand the interaction between heart rhythm and neurologic health, and to
investigate methods to prevent cognitive dysfunction due to AF. Thus, in the proposed study, we will test our
hypothesis that among AF patients receiving oral anticoagulation, restoration of sinus rhythm with catheter
ablation vs drug therapy leads to less long-term neurologic damage and dysfunction due to improved cerebral
blood flow and lower risk for additional ischemic injury. The primary aims of our prospective, observational
clinical trial are to 1) compare structural cortical characteristics in Alzheimer’s disease-risk regions in AF patients
treated with catheter ablation vs drug therapy; 2) compare cerebral blood flow in AF patients treated with catheter
ablation vs drug therapy; 3) compare cognitive function in AF patients treated with catheter ablation vs drug
therapy; and 4) assess the relationship between neurologic outcomes and plasma and imaging biomarkers of
coagulation and inflammation. This will be the first study to incorporate a comprehensive neurocognitive test
battery, structural and functional neuroimaging, cerebral blood flow assessment, and plasma and imaging
biomarkers to a) better delineate the contribution of each of the known risk factors to the development of cognitive
decline in patients with AF, and b) assess how restoration of sinus rhythm using catheter ablation vs drug therapy
may alter the trajectory of cognitive decline and development of dementia. Our preliminary data showed that
catheter ablation did not worsen cognitive function or white matter hyperintensity burden 6 weeks or 1 year later,
while drug therapy patients showed greater cortical thinning at 1 year in brain regions associated with
Alzheimer’s, and this thinning correlated with worse cognitive performance. Thus, this study is significant, and
will vertically advance the field of AF management by revolutionizing our understanding of the mechanisms by
which AF induces cognitive decline, and by providing an important and necessary step toward justifying rhythm
control by catheter ablation as a strategy to arrest the processes that lead to cognitive impairment and dementia."

Smell loss is a common neurosensory disability accompanying infection with SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus.
The frequency and persistence of alteration in the ability to smell, or olfactory dysfunction (OD), observed
during the COVID-19 pandemic highlight a knowledge gap, where risk factors predicting post-viral OD and
subsequent neurological dysfunction remain poorly understood. This K23 proposal will characterize
epidemiological risk factors associated with OD following COVID-19 infections, which in turn may signify risk
for neurocognitive and neuropsychological impairment in daily functioning and quality of life. As a career
development award, this proposal will provide Dr. Jonathan Overdevest, MD, PhD, an Assistant Professor in
the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Columbia University Irving Medical Center
(CUIMC) with structured training to establish an independent career in the study of olfactory dysfunction and
neurocognition. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, D.P. Devanand, and an experienced team of
experts, Dr. Overdevest will develop domain expertise in the design and analysis of chemosensory-focused
neuroepidemiologic studies using patient-oriented research (POR) methodology. Building upon preliminary
data evaluating prevalence and persistence of OD in a vulnerable minority population served by CUIMC, Dr.
Overdevest will develop the framework for a longitudinal cohort study within this multi-ethnic population. The
research in Aim 1 will investigate epidemiologic risk factors for primary and persistent OD following COVID-19
infection by evaluating OD with subjective functional domain and test-based objective tools. In Aim 2, he will
study the relationship between persistent OD and neurological, neurocognitive, and neuropsychiatric
functioning using validated measures from the multilingual NIH Toolbox assessment battery. He will then
extend this preliminary work into the realm of neuroimaging by leveraging existing local research infrastructure
and the expertise of his mentorship team to develop pilot data correlating features of OD and neurologic
outcomes with anatomic and inflammatory changes in the brain. These studies will inform strategies for
counseling the public about demographic risk factors for experiencing COVID-19 related OD, associate risks
for additional neurological disabilities, and provide the foundation for future investigation into imaging
modalities to evaluate the central processing of olfaction and monitor outcomes of clinical trials for OD
interventions."
10812337,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Autoimmune diseases collectively affect over 23 million Americans and impose a huge burden of disease.
Many autoimmune diseases are characterized by pathologic T cell-B cell interactions and production of
autoantibodies. The T cell populations that help B cells in autoimmune diseases vary in phenotype and include
T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which reside in follicles of secondary lymphoid organs, as well as T peripheral
helper (Tph) cells, which are B cell-helper T cells that migrate to inflamed peripheral tissues such as the
rheumatoid joint. Tph cells and Tfh cells share the ability to recruit B cells via production of a B cell
chemoattractant CXCL13 and then promote B cell differentiation through both surface interactions and
secreted cytokines. The signals that regulate development and function of Tph cells and Tfh cells in
autoimmunity remain incompletely described, and particularly little is known about T cell production of
CXCL13. Our preliminary data reveal the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-gated transcription factor,
as a potent negative regulator of Tph and Tfh cell phenotype, with a dramatic effect on suppressing T cell
CXCL13 production. In this project, we utilize human primary T cells and patient samples to evaluate the broad
effects of AHR on Tph and Tfh cell development, function, and transcriptomic and epigenetic regulation. We
will evaluate the direct targets of AHR in human T cells via ChIP-seq and seek to identify new transcriptional
mediators downstream of AHR using CRISPR arrays. In addition, we will study synovial fluid and serum
samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and comparator conditions to evaluate alterations in the extent
of AHR agonist and antagonist activity in rheumatoid arthritis, a disease characterized by abundant
accumulation of Tph cells in the target tissue. We expect that this project will reveal novel mechanisms
mediated by AHR that regulate production of CXCL13 and key features of Tfh and Tph cell phenotypes.
Understanding the molecular control of these key T cell functions may highlight new strategies to interfere with
Tph and Tfh cells therapeutically."

It is widely accepted that oxygen deficiency is a culprit and a marker of several major retinal diseases,
including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma etc. However, it remains to be
extremely challenging to measure oxygen in vivo in the eye, and no tools currently exist that can provide 3D
oxygen distributions in the retina with high spatial resolution at appropriate imaging speeds. The goal of this
project is to overcome these limitations and develop a new optical imaging technique for volumetric oxygen
mapping in retina. Our approach will leverage the recently developed potent oxygen probes (such as Oxyphor
2P), whose phosphorescence decay times serve as quantitative markers of local oxygen partial pressures (pO2)
in living tissues. To enable volumetric imaging with high throughput, we propose to develop a novel imaging
instrument, termed oblique scanning laser ophthalmoscope (oSLO). oSLO is based on the concept of single
lens scanned light sheet microscopy and enables volumetric phosphorescence lifetime imaging without time-
consuming plane-by-plane pixel-wise sectioning. Our new method should be able to achieve 10 kilohertz voxel
rate that is three orders of magnitude higher than the current state-of-the-art two-photon phosphorescence
lifetime microscopy (2PLM). In this project we will: (Aim 1) develop a phosphorescence lifetime-based oSLO
for volumetric pO2 mapping in living retina in mouse. The new design will allow parallel detection of signals at
depth from each scanned location, so that the need in conventional depth sectioning is eliminated and imaging
throughput is greatly increased. We will (Aim 2) dynamically image responses of retina and choroid to systemic
hypoxia challenge using Oxyphor 2P. We will (Aim 3) then bridge oSLO measurements and label-free
applications by multimodal imaging with visible light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT). Using vascular
pO2 as the ground-truth, we will develop a deep spectral training (DSL) algorithm to supervise the inverse
calculation of vis-OCT for robust and reliable label-free retinal oximetry. This study will enable the first direct
quantitative imaging of interactions between the two circulatory systems in retina (i.e. retinal and choroidal
circulation), providing unprecedented information about retinal oxygen supply. IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH:
Successful completion of this program will deliver a new ground-breaking methodology for mapping oxygen in
the retina that will greatly improve our understanding of retinal diseases."

AutoImmune Regulator gene (AIRE) prevents autoimmunity by promoting thymic deletion of self-reactive T cells.
While most studied in the thymus, AIRE is also expressed in secondary lymphoid organs, where it is thought to
contribute to peripheral tolerance through interaction with and deletion of self-reactive CD4+ T cells. However,
AIRE’s role in the periphery is likely more multi-faceted than in the thymus. We recently identified AIRE
expression in tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), which are known to inhibit anti-tumor immune responses.
While Aire-expressing tumor associated macrophages (aTAMs) were only recently discovered by our group,
prior work implicates AIRE in inhibiting anti-tumor immunity. Recently available tools to study AIRE in mice have
facilitated investigation of peripheral AIRE expression and aTAMs. We have found aTAMs in several common
solid tumor models expressing common macrophage markers (CD11b, F4/80, and CD64) by both flow cytometry
and mass cytometry (CyTOF). Additionally, interrogation of several public human RNA-seq datasets supports
AIRE expression in tumor resident myeloid cell types. This preliminary data together with the therapeutic
potential for targeting aTAMs to improve cancer immunotherapy make this a population deserving of thorough
functional investigation. This proposal will test the hypothesis that aTAMs are an immunosuppressive,
pro-tumoral cell population. Aim 1 of this proposal will define the phenotypic, transcriptional, and epigenetic
profiles of aTAMs. Aim 2 will determine the mechanism(s) driving induction of AIRE expression in aTAMs. Aim
3 will identify the role of aTAMs in regulating local and systemic immune responses during anti-tumor immunity.
This research approach will be carried out using a variety of methods including single cell analysis via RNA-seq,
CyTOF, flow cytometry, and ATAC-seq, ex vivo co-cultures, and in vivo assays utilizing novel genetic mouse
models. These proposed studies will be the first characterization of AIRE expression in any tumor
resident immune cells and will further establish our understanding of the function of peripheral AIRE-
expressing cell types. This could result in the discovery of novel pathways relevant to therapeutic resistance
and further our understanding of global AIRE function. Translationally, this work may identify novel perturbations
to improve patient responses to immunotherapy. This research project and fellowship training will be
conducted at a top-funded research institution, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), in the
laboratories of Dr. Matthew Spitzer, Dr. Lewis Lanier, and Dr. James Gardner with expert mentorship from Dr.
Matthew (Max) Krummel. Dr. Lanier has made extensive foundational discoveries in immune cell biology. Dr.
Spitzer has expertise in systems immunology and single cell methods. Dr. James Gardner has expertise in the
study of peripheral AIRE and mouse model generation. Dr. Max Krummel has expertise in tumor myeloid cell
biology and cancer immunotherapies. Overall, this facility and team provide a rich training environment for
completion of this research and development of professional skills necessary for a career in academic research."
10818385,"Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines have shown excellent safety and vaccine efficacy
(VE) in more than 25 clinical trials in Africa, Europe, and the US; Phase 3 assessment will begin in mid 2020.
Our goal during the next decade is to develop, license, and deploy next generation PfSPZ vaccines with
increased breadth, magnitude, and/or durability of VE and decreased cost of goods. The 1st and 2nd generation
aseptic, purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ vaccines, whether radiation-, chemo-, or genetically-attenuated are
composed of Pf of the West (W.) African strain of Pf, NF54. In general East (E.) African strains of Pf are more
distant genetically from NF54 than are W. African strains, and Asian strains are much more distant genetically
from NF54 than are any African Pf strains. Thus, it is possible that immunizing with an E. African strain in E.
Africa will be more protective than immunizing with the W. African strain, NF54. Likewise, immunizing with
an Asian strain of Pf in Asia will likely be more protective than immunizing with a W. African strain like NF54.
In this project we will identify, characterize and optimize PfSPZ production from E. African and Asian strains
of Pf. One of the problems we have had in the past is the inability to produce large numbers of stage V
gametocytes/ culture and PfSPZ/ mosquito from any Pf strain except NF54. We have identified an Asian (Thai)
strain, NHP4026, that is a good stage V gametocyte and PfSPZ producer, although not as good as NF54. To
achieve parity and ideally exceed stage V gametocyte and PfSPZ production, we will genetically engineer the E.
African and Asian Pf by overexpressing PfAP2-G a transcription factor that is a key regulator of sexual stage
development. We will use these new strains alone or as has been successfully shown for the Theilera parva
(East Coast Fever) vaccine in Africa and Prevnar, the Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine used worldwide, we
will mix the parasites to create a vaccine cocktail. Producing multiple strains of Pf in a vaccine will be more
expensive than producing a single strain. Thus, we will produce hybrid parasites by genetic crossing to include
the desired genetic/ proteomic diversity in a single Pf parasite. This will provide proof of concept for how to
generate PfSPZ immunogens protecting against global Pf diversity. We propose to increase the
magnitude/potency of the immune response to any dose of PfSPZ by selecting for PfSPZ that are more infective
to hepatocytes and by creating through genetic alteration, late arresting replication component PfSPZ that
express many more antigens and more of each antigen than do current early arresting radiation- and
genetically-attenuated PfSPZ. Adjuvants have often provided the most direct route to increasing the durability
of vaccines. We have identified a glycolipid adjuvant that increases the potency and durability of murine
malaria SPZ vaccines. In this project we will determine the impact of this adjuvant on the immunogenicity of
the hybrid and late arresting strains we develop by assessing in non-human primates. The goal is to provide
PfSPZ vaccine candidate(s) poised for further downstream process development and future clinical evaluation."

Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines have shown excellent safety and vaccine
efficacy (VE) in more than 25 clinical trials in Africa, Europe, and the US; Phase 3 assessment will begin in
mid-2020. Our goal during the next decade is to develop, license, and deploy next generation SPZ vaccines
with increased breadth, magnitude, and/or durability of VE and decreased cost of goods. Current assays and
animal models do not offer an alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating whether a vaccine candidate
exhibits superior performance to current SPZ vaccines. In this project we aim to develop in vitro assays and/or
non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate a vaccine recipient will be protected against Pf malaria by a
SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines. Success could come from increased
understanding of the 1) immunological effector mechanisms of protective immunity (PI), 2) antigenic targets of
PI, and/or 3) organs and cells involved in induction of the PI. Despite many studies, our understanding of these
3 areas has only modestly improved in the last 2 decades. In 2000 it was hypothesized that antigen-specific,
tissue resident CD8+ T cells in the liver that recognized Pf peptides bound to class I HLA molecules on the
surface of Pf-infected hepatocytes were the key cells mediating PI. This hypothesis led to a seminal study that
demonstrated subcutaneous administration of PfSPZ Vaccine did not lead to induction of PfSPZ-specific,
CD8+ T cells in the livers of immunized NHPs, but intravenous (IV) administration did. Based in large part on
these results, a clinical trial of IV administration was initiated, and the trial showed 100% VE. Subsequently,
>25 clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines have shown that empirical alteration of PfSPZ/dose, number of doses,
interval between doses, and method of attenuation can improve performance of PfSPZ vaccines. However, we
have learned little about mechanisms and targets of PI, or the tissues involved in induction of PI. We believe
this is because the effector activity takes place in the liver, and induction of PI also takes place in the central
compartment, which is inaccessible in humans. Since our last major advance came from studying the livers of
immunized NHPs, we think much more information can be gleaned from this approach, including elucidation of
immunological effectors and targets, and comparison and down-selection of vaccine candidates. Therefore, in
this project we will develop 3 models in outbred NHPs to study SPZ vaccine-induced immunity, and use the
data generated in the models and systems biology assays to establish biomarkers and groups of assays
(signature) that consistently predict whether a NHP will be protected, and establish blood surrogates of tissue
markers. The best assays/ biomarkers/signatures will be assessed using serum, plasma, and PBMCs from
protected/unprotected subjects assessed in clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines. Finally, we will use the
assays/biomarkers/signatures and model systems to screen newly developed SPZ vaccines, especially
genetically altered vaccines, to down-select which should move to process development and clinical testing."
10852018,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT. My research program focuses on understanding the cellular and
molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of tissue injury mediated by meprin metalloproteases.
Meprins comprise of two subunits, α and β, which form two protein isoforms, meprin A (α-α or α-β) and meprin
B (β-β) with distinct and overlapping substrates. Meprins are most abundantly expressed in the brush-border
membranes of proximal kidney tubules and small intestines. Meprins are also expressed in leukocytes
(monocytes and macrophages), podocytes, skin, endothelial cells, and cancer cells. Meprins have been
implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory- and fibrosis-associated diseases that include kidney
disease, inflammatory bowel disease, lung fibrosis, neurodegenerative disease (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease), and
cancer. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the meprin β gene were shown to associate with severity
of certain diseases such as diabetic kidney disease and cancer. My research group uses a combination of
molecular biology and proteomic approaches to identify meprin substrates and characterize the interactions
between meprin isoforms and their substrates. These are coupled with in vivo studies with meprin knockout
mouse models to determine how meprin activity impacts the progression of disease. Known meprin substrates
include extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, modulators of inflammation (e.g. proinflammatory cytokines [IL-1β,
IL-6, IL-18, MCP-1; and anti-inflammatory proteins Ac-SDKP), cell signaling proteins (e.g. protein kinase A and
protein kinase C), mediators of the hypoxia response (e.g. osteosarcoma-9), tight junction proteins (e.g.
claudin 5, occludin, E-cadherin, and Z0-1) cytoskeletal proteins (e.g. villin and actin) and proteins that
contribute to plaques in AD (e.g. amyloid precursor protein and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells
2). The diversity of meprins substrates suggests that complex mechanisms are involved under different
conditions and in different organs. It’s important to gain understanding of these mechanisms to facilitate
development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools. For the five year period of this proposal, we will conduct
studies in three areas; (i) to determine how SNPS in the meprin β gene impact its interactions with substrates
and physiological sheddases, (ii) determine how meprin interactions with substrates modulate signaling
pathways and impact responses in hypoxia, inflammation, and ECM metabolism, and (iii) to evaluate the use of
meprin and meprin cleavage products as biomarkers for development of diagnostic tools for early detection of
disease. The proposed research will transcend basic (in vitro and in vivo) to gain insights on the basis for
genetic predispositions associated with meprins. Translational studies are also proposed to apply this
knowledge in development of diagnostic tools applicable to diabetic kidney injury and Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), an important step in advancing precision medicine. Furthermore, this award will facilitate mentoring of
trainees from underrepresented minority populations and thus promote diversity of the biomedical workforce."

The Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet) is an established and
productive network within the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (leDEA) program.
CCASAnet was created in 2006 during the first leDEA funding cycle and has brought together clinical, statistical,
epidemiologic, and informatics resources from HIV clinical care and research sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru, along with a coordinating center in Nashville, USA. Together, the members
of the CCASAnet collaboration respond to scientific opportunities arising in the region and across HIV research
networks worldwide. The CCASAnet Data Coordinating Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VDCC)
manages the CCASAnet consortium and works to harmonize and analyze the complex databases generated by
participating sites. The VDCC also provides mentoring and education to enhance clinical research and data
management capabilities at CCASAnet sites, promote junior researchers, and catalyze ongoing growth of
scientific leadership in the region. Over the next five years, CCASAnet will assess inequities in the HIV continuum
of care; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV care delivery; outcomes in vulnerable populations
including migrants, those ""lost to follow-up,"" and pregnant women; determinants and prevention of non-
communicable diseases; and treatment outcomes in TB patients with and without HIV. We will also characterize
psychosocial, behavioral, and non-communicable disease clinical outcomes in adolescents, transgender, and
older persons through new prospective cohorts nested in the CCASAnet retrospective clinical cohort. We will
continue to develop and apply innovative biostatistics and informatics methods, grow our productive
collaborations with other IeDEA regions, and provide leadership in the site assessment, data harmonization, and
data sharing initiatives. Through these activities, CCASAnet 4 will help advance both the science of HIV
epidemiology and the information science that underpins international research collaboration."

Determining “what works for whom” is a key goal in prevention and treatment across a variety of
areas, including mental health. By understanding which individuals benefit most from which
treatments we have the possibility of directing scarce resources to those who will most benefit,
and of reducing the “churn” of individuals attempting multiple treatments before finding the one
that works for them. Identifying effect moderators—factors that relate to the size of treatment
effects--is crucial for delivery of treatment and prevention interventions, but doing so is
incredibly difficult using standard study designs. Randomized trials, the gold standard for
estimating average effects, are typically under-powered to detect moderation. Large-scale non-
experimental studies may provide another way to examine effect moderation, but can suffer
from confounding. New methods are needed to best harness the data available to learn how to
personalize mental health treatments. This work will synthesize, extend, and apply methods for
identifying effect moderators when multiple studies are available, with a particular focus on the
complexities in mental health research. The methods will apply broadly and will be illustrated in
an example estimating the effects of medication treatment for schizophrenia, using data from 11
randomized controlled trials and non-experimental data from the Duke University Health System
electronic health record. The work will: 1) Extend moderation methods for scenarios with
multiple randomized experiments, 2) Develop methods for using data from combined datasets
with both experimental and non-experimental designs to identify effect moderation, and 3)
Disseminate the methods to mental health researchers. By developing methods to take full
advantage of both experimental and non-experimental data this work has the potential to move
towards personalized mental health, thus improving how we prevent and treat mental health
challenges in the population."

Periodontitis and peri-implantitis are oral diseases characterized by loss of oral homeostasis and induction of
inflammation. Although downstream inflammatory events that occur in connective tissue have been well
recognized, the regulatory pathways involved in epithelial barrier function in these diseases has not been
explored in detail. In this study, we aim to identify key spatiotemporal mechanisms that control epithelial barrier
function. Although it is recognized that epithelial barrier function is critical it's regulation is not well understood.
To address this, in vivo and in vitro experimental models, such as Epi-oral device, have been developed. Based
on Prel Data we will investigate the role of FOXO1, E-cadherin and β−catenin in the maintenance and loss of
barrier function through bacteria induced signaling. Preliminary Data demonstrate that pressure enhances
epithelial barrier and directs E-cadherin/β−catenin to cell membranes and FOXO1 to the cytoplasm. E.coli LPS,
a TLR4 agonist, reverses this behavior and directs FOXO1 and β−catenin to the nucleus and from cell membranes
E-cadherin. These data serve as the basis to mechanistically investigate the role of mechanical pressure on
promoting epithelial integrity and its disruption by E.coli LPS and F. nucleatum, an important oral bacterium,
by use of the Epi-oral platform (Aim1). Next, we will investigate how epithelial attachment to titanium may
affect barrier function in studies that will give insight into processes that are important in peri-implantitis.
Specifically, we will examine how the interaction of keratinocytes-titanium, as underlying matrix, regulates
keratinocytes in the presence of pressure or E.coli LPS and F. nucleatum (Aim2). Finally, we will investigate
how FOXO1, β−catenin and E-cadherin are modulated in healthy tissue compared to inflamed tissue in vivo.
Animal experiments will involve mechanistic studies to examine the role of upstream events in barrier function
by lineage specific deletion of FOXO1 and TLR4 in keratinocytes in vivo, to examine dysregulation of β−catenin,
E-cadherin and the formation of tight junctions. Similar studies will be examined in human tissue from non-
inflamed gingiva, and gingiva from patients with periodontitis and peri-implantitis sites to determine if similar
dysregulation occurs in these disease processes (Aim3). Given the recognized fundamental importance of the
complexity in oral diseases, these studies may pave the way to identify novel targets for treatments against
periodontitis and peri-implantitis."

established and supported a robust Office of Cancer Career Enhancement and Training (OCCET) to facilitate
the education and training of researchers, clinicians, trainees, staff, and community providers. The overall goal
of the HCCC OCCET is to establish and foster infrastructure that coordinates and facilitates educational
opportunities to enhance the careers of cancer researchers, clinicians, and community providers. OCCET
initiatives include summer research programs, graduate programs, an annual research retreat, HCCC-
supported seminar series, and support for staff participation in national conferences. These programs are
targeted towards multiple levels of training, from “from teens to tenure” and beyond. The OCCET is committed
to enhancing the inclusion of underrepresented minorities and trainees from lower socioeconomic households
and rural populations who represent a significant untapped pool of talent from our catchment area. As a matrix
cancer center, the HCCC's educational initiatives are integrated with other educational programs at the
University of Iowa (UI) and are designed to leverage, but not duplicate, institutional career enhancement
efforts. The OCCET also provides the framework for intra- and interprogrammatic interactions and
collaborations between researchers in the HCCC's four research programs. The OCCET is led by the
Associate Director for Career Enhancement, Jon Houtman, PhD and supported by the Assistant Director for
Career Enhancement, Gregory Thomas, PhD, and staff at the HCCC. The staff in the OCCET are advised by
several committees, including the Career Enhancement Advisory Committee, composed of leaders of training
grants and graduate programs and representatives of various trainee groups. The efforts of the OCCET are 1)
to establish and maintain a robust cancer career enhancement and training infrastructure at the HCCC by
fostering the career enhancement infrastructure responsible for the training of HCCC trainees, faculty, staff,
and community providers and integrating these efforts into wider programs at both UI and within the HCCC
catchment area, 2) to assure quality training and mentoring of diverse trainees at all stages of training by
supporting the development of a cancer workforce through training initiatives at every career stage, and 3) to
facilitate educational and career enhancement opportunities for trainees, faculty, clinicians, and staff of the
HCCC and across Iowa by facilitating existing, and generating new, opportunities for learning and scientific
discussion at all levels including trainees, faculty, clinicians, and staff at the HCCC, as well as at other

10897978,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.
COPD is defined by a decrease in lung function as measured by pulmonary function testing (PFT), namely
forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and its ratio to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). While the main
risk factor for COPD is cigarette smoking, the risk of COPD also increases with age, and COPD can progress
despite smoking cessation. There are no current pharmacologic therapies that slow progression of COPD or
affect mortality. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of PFT and COPD have identified >
200 associated genetic loci. However, COPD and PFT GWAS have been limited by imperfect matching and
sample sizes of reference panels (e.g. HapMap or 1000 Genomes), and downstream interpretation has been
limited by lack of disease- and tissue-specific eQTL and pQTL resources and under-represention in African
American and Hispanic/Latino subjects for both common and rare variants. In addition, all studies used for
GWAS performed to date have limited representation of rare and infrequent risk-associated variants. The
NHLBI TOPMed program is now generating RNA-seq and proteomics data for thousands of TOPMed
participants with whole genome sequence (WGS) data. TOPMed specifically is enhanced with subjects of non-
European ancestry populations, thereby increasing ethnic diversity and including participants from the
population-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis [MESA], the COPD-enriched COPDGene study, and
the Lung Tissue Research Consortium [LTRC]). We hypothesize systematic integration of multi-omic data with
novel rare/infrequent variant associations identified through TOPMed will accelerate discovery and validation of
novel biomarkers, definition of the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of COPD, and construction
of improved genetic risk models for diverse ancestry populations. To address these overarching hypotheses,
we propose two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will identify rare/infrequent and common variation underlying
PFT and COPD through expanded WGS analysis in TOPMed, perform multi-ancestry fine mapping, and
construct new genetic risk prediction models tailored to African ancestry and multi-ancestry
applications. In Aim 2, we will identify and validate candidate genes and molecular targets underlying
known and novel genetic associations for PFT / COPD through comprehensive multi-omic and
functional studies. To accomplish these Aims, we will combine the most current methods for WGS analysis
with novel multi-omics approaches to leverage our large-scale high quality RNA-seq and proteomic resources.
We have assembled an interdisciplinary collaborative group representing expertise in statistical genetics,
pulmonary epidemiology, integrative genomics, proteomics, and pulmonary medicine. Completion of these
Aims will establish an expanded view of rare and common genetic variation and their downstream molecular
targets in multi-ethnic samples from population-based and COPD-enriched cohorts."
10888155,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One of the most critical functions of the vitamin A (retinol) metabolite retinoic acid (RA) is control of
eye development. In mouse, RA synthesis occurs early in the optic field with expression of retinol
dehydrogenase-10 (RDH10) and all three retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2,
ALDH1A3) that convert retinol to RA. RA diffuses to tissues throughout the optic placode, optic
vesicle, and adjacent mesenchyme to stimulate folding of the optic vesicle to form the optic cup by
E10.5. At E12.5-E14.5, RA is needed for further morphogenesis of the optic cup and surrounding
perioptic mesenchyme; loss of RA leads to microphthalmia. RA functions by binding to nuclear RA
receptors at RA response elements (RAREs) that either activate or repress transcription of key
genes. Binding of RA to RA receptors regulates recruitment of transcriptional coregulators such as
nuclear receptor coactivator (NCOA) and nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR), which in turn
control binding of the generic coactivator p300 and the generic corepressor PRC2. However, a
major unsolved problem is what are the key genes controlled by RA during development of the eye;
only two candidate direct RA target genes are known (Pitx2 and Foxc1). As loss or gain of RA
activity alters expression of thousands of genes (perhaps many due to post-transcriptional effects),
it remains difficult to identify genes that are direct transcriptional targets of RA. In our Preliminary
Studies we addressed this question by comparing ChIP-seq and RNA-seq for tissues from
Aldh1a2-/- embryos lacking RA synthesis, thus identifying genes with altered expression when RA
is missing that also have nearby RA-regulated deposition of H3K27ac (gene activation mark) or
H3K27me3 (gene repression mark) associated with RAREs. Such RARE enhancers/silencers were
identified near genes already known to be required for embryonic development, thus validating our
approach. CRISPR knockouts for several predicted new direct RA target genes verified their
requirements for development. Here, we plan to use this approach to identify RA target genes and
PITX2 target genes during eye development by comparing ChIP-seq (H3K27ac & H3K27me3) and
RNA-seq for wild-type vs RA-deficient optic vesicle and eye, and wild-type vs Pitx2 knockout eye.
We will also identify RA-regulated enhancers and silencers in the eye to uncover the mechanisms
through which RA regulates Pitx2, Foxc1, or other genes. Our studies will provide vital information
on the mechanisms utilized by RA and PITX2 to control transcription in the eye and will identify
gene regulatory networks during eye formation. This knowledge will help determine how eye
defects occur, identify new genes or enhancers/silencers that may be mutational targets causing
human eye defects, and improve strategies to treat eye defects."

 The sharp rise in anti-immigrant policy since early 2017, ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and longstanding
experiences of Latinx discrimination and marginalization raise serious stress-related public health concerns for
today’s Latinx youth, the vast majority of whom are U.S. citizens. Chronic and/or severe exposure to adversity
can elevate stress processes in the family (e.g., increased maternal depression) and manifest through youth’s
behavioral health (e.g., unhealthy diet), and biology (e.g., flatter diurnal slopes of daily cortisol output). These
stress processes can increase mental health and chronic disease risks and limit social mobility for Latinx youth
making the consequential transition to adulthood. We propose major expansions to Caminos, an NICHD-
funded study collecting 8 time points of data at 6-month lags (2018-2021) for a diverse sample of 547 Latinx
adolescents (88% U.S. born) and mothers (80% foreign born) in suburban Atlanta. As in other new settlement
areas, Georgia’s Latinx youth and families face a less welcoming immigrant context of reception than occurs in
established immigrant areas. The proposed study will add five time points of annual data, extending current
measures into the transition to adulthood and assessing hair and salivary cortisol indicating chronic and acute
stress, waist circumference, and survey reports of chronic disease risk and social mobility. The 13 time points
of data (2018 to 2026) will trace the onset of behaviors from as early as age 11 and occurring before, during,
and after the pandemic and during a changing U.S. immigrant political environment. We will use state-of-the-
art methods to multiply impute intentionally and unintentionally missing data for a Latinx cohort with high
retention in the ongoing study. Guided by family stress models and cultural-developmental theory, cross-
lagged path models and latent growth mixture models will test the hypothesis that family, biological, and
behavioral health stress processes mediate associations between adversities (e.g., responses to anti-
immigrant actions, pandemic-related events, Latinx marginalization) and Latinx youth’s mental health risks
(internalizing and externalizing symptoms, substance use), chronic disease risks (e.g., asthma, diabetes), and
social mobility (e.g., educational attainment). Using tests of moderated mediation, we will identify community-,
family-, and individual-level protective factors that mitigate impacts of adversity and stress on youth outcomes.
Sex as a biological variable will be examined as a key modifier. Unique from other national and cohort studies,
the proposed research will identify how accumulated adversities rooted in anti-immigrant experiences and the
pandemic shape Latinx youth’s health outcomes and social mobility over time. In addition, the proposed study
is uniquely situated in a new immigrant area and examines Latinx marginalization within and outside of the
residential neighborhood by using geocoded census data on mother activity spaces. Elevating translational
impacts, findings will inform programs for Latinx youth who may struggle to recover from pandemic and
immigration-related adversities as they prepare for adulthood."

Neurological injuries and diseases negatively affect quality of life for millions of people in the US. In particular,
damage to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) causes various visual and oculomotor pathologies, including
optic ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and simultagnosia. Nonhuman primate and human studies have elucidated
how PPC integrates visual and motor information to plan and execute movement decisions. However, much
still remains unknown about how and where PPC represents future decisions and actions. In this
proposal, we will use two complementary techniques, functional ultrasound neuroimaging (fUS) and
electrophysiology, to explore how PPC represents decision and motor variables. These variables include
movement effector, target location, and action desirability. To date, neural recording techniques have sacrificed
spatial and temporal resolution for field of view or vice-versa. Now, fUS is available as an innovative
neuroimaging technique that measures cerebral hemodynamics with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution
(<100 µm; ~100 ms) and a large field of view (several cm) – specifications ideally suited to recording detailed
activity of entire cortical regions in parallel. In addition, we will use electrophysiology, the gold standard for
neuronal recordings, to verify fUS findings at the single-neuron level. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the
anatomical organization of movement location in PPC by recording fUS data as rhesus macaques complete
eye and hand movements to visual targets. This will provide a detailed cortical map of response fields in PPC
according to effector and movement location. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify how and where decision
variables (effort and reward) are encoded in PPC. Like Specific Aim 1, we will record fUS data while animals
perform eye and hand movements, but we will also vary reward and effort by independently changing the liquid
reward amount and required accuracy (i.e. effort) for each movement. In Specific Aim 3, we will investigate
the link between cerebral hemodynamics and the underlying neural activity through simultaneous fUS and
broad-band electrophysiology (single-unit, multi-unit, and LFP). We will use these data to 1) validate our fUS
findings and 2) explore interesting patches of activity at the single neuron level. If successful, this contribution
will further validate fUS as a robust and accessible neuroimaging technique for future research and clinical
applications where electrophysiology is difficult to attain and/or scale. Together, these Specific Aims will
elucidate where motor and decision variables are encoded in PPC from the micro-scale (electrophysiology) to
the meso-scale (fUS). By understanding the neuronal circuits influencing visual-motor decisions, we can better
understand visual-motor disorders, e.g. optic ataxia and oculomotor apraxia. This project will be conducted
through the UCLA-Caltech MSTP under the mentorship of Drs. Andersen and Shapiro. The described research
will form the basis of my PhD thesis and instill the skills for me to become an accomplished physician scientist."

Gait impairments are ubiquitous after stroke, leading to persistent mobility deficits in most stroke survivors.
Assessment of these impairments guides patient care and the use of clinical interventions, yet obtaining a
complete picture of the factors that underlie these deficits remains an ongoing challenge. Clinicians currently
assess patients post-stroke with coarse, qualitative metrics obtained at rest, combined with functional
evaluations and visual inspection of walking. However, these tools only enable assessment of the external
changes that underlie patient symptoms and cannot provide insight into internal changes that may cause these
symptoms. These internal properties—including how joint stiffness and viscosity vary throughout locomotion—
are fundamental mechanical descriptions that govern the movement of the body. Joint stiffness is a key factor in
energy storage and forward movement, while joint viscosity describes resistance during gait, and yet these
concepts are currently unaccounted for or misjudged in clinical decision making. For example, ankle joint
stiffness and viscosity, which clinicians believe to be increased post-stroke, were surprisingly found to be
reduced or unchanged when compared to the less-affected side. Additionally, Botulinum Neurotoxin (BoNT)
injections—a commonly-used medication for lowering joint stiffness—may cause further reduction in these
properties, which could be detrimental to mobility. These initial results highlight the need for treatment that
accounts for how joint stiffness and viscosity are affected after stroke and injection therapy.
In the proposed work, we go beyond traditional descriptions of gait using quick displacements of the ankle while
measuring its mechanical response. We use these data to measure how joint stiffness and viscosity vary during
walking. In previous work, we pioneered this approach to quantify joint stiffness and viscosity during motion. In
this project, we will extend our approach to determine how stroke and BoNT injection treatment affect these
properties. In this project, three aims lay the foundation to transform treatment post-stroke by both investigating
new assessments techniques for ankle stiffness and viscosity, and also quantifying how anti-spastic treatment
(i.e. BoNT therapy) affects these properties. In our first Aim, we extend the results from our R21 to assess how
ankle stiffness and viscosity change post-stroke. In our second Aim, we quantify the effect of Botulinum
Neurotoxin to understand how this treatment affects ankle stiffness and viscosity, gait biomechanics, and
functional outcomes. This aim is also supported by our preliminary data that demonstrates BoNT reduces joint
stiffness. Finally, in our third Aim, we investigate a simpler, surrogate measure for joint stiffness, namely the
slope of the joint's torque-angle curve, which could improve the clinical feasibility of our approach. While this
research builds upon our previous work, the proposed studies will provide a clear picture of the internal changes
that drive gait deficits which can be used to guide treatment, such as injections and orthoses."

To inform payment policy that promotes parity, this study examines how voluntary bundled payments impact
access and outcomes for racial minorities, ethnic minorities, and individuals with low socioeconomic status
(SES), vulnerable groups that have long faced disparities in health care access and outcomes. This application
aligns with the Special Emphasis Notice Health Services Research Priorities for Achieving a High Value
Healthcare System (NOT-HS-19-011) Priority Area #3: Payment for outcomes. Voluntary bundled payments
could exacerbate existing disparities if participating providers perceive that vulnerable patients’ outcomes are
difficult to manage and avoid participating in the payment model (i.e., provider selection) or participate but
avoid caring for vulnerable groups (i.e., patient selection). It is also vital to understand how impacts on
disparities vary based on providers’ mission and experience caring for vulnerable groups (e.g., safety-net vs.
non-safety-net providers). Such insights are particularly critical for lower extremity joint replacement (LEJR),
congestive heart failure (CHF), and sepsis – the most prevalent procedures and conditions that are both
marked by significant, existing disparities and targeted by voluntary bundled payment programs. The insights
generated by this proposal are also critical given the impact of COVID-19 on both payment reform and health
care disparities. We hypothesize that providers participating in voluntary bundled payment programs will be
less likely than non-participants to be located in markets with a high proportion of vulnerable individuals; that
disparities in access and outcomes will widen for vulnerable patients, as compared to other patients, after
providers start participating in voluntary bundled payments compared to providers that do not participate; that
these effects will vary by racial minority versus ethnic minority status, and interactions between racial and
ethnic minority status and low SES; and that disparities will widen less at safety-net versus non-safety-net
providers."

The goal of this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award is to prepare the
candidate for an independent research career
Breast cancer survivors who exercise regularly
in behavioral oncology and health behavior intervention science.
post-cancer diagnosis are less likely to die from cancer and even
modest increases in physical activity (≥
related mortality. However, longitudinal studies show significant declines in exercise engagement during the 12-
15 minutes/week) yield clinically meaningful reductions in breast cancer-
months post-diagnosis, with most breast cancer survivors never fully returning to pre-diagnosis activity levels.
The candidate proposes an innovative approach, based on affect-regulation, to addressing physical inactivity as
a public health risk factor negatively impacting breast cancer survivorship. The training and mentoring plan is
designed to provide knowledge and skills in (1) early-phase intervention development, (2) intensive longitudinal
data collection and analysis methods, (3) randomized clinical trial design, and (4) professional development. The
proposed research will refine an affect-regulated exercise prescription strategy (Affect-Rx) for use with physically
inactive breast cancer survivors (Aim 1), test for proof-of-concept the effect of Affect-Rx on clinically meaningful
moderate-vigorous physical activity participation post-intervention, operationalized as ≥
90 mins/week
(Aim 2),
and quantify the strength of within-person associations between affective factors and total physical activity (Aim
3). The candidate will use the milestones for early-phase intervention development established by the Obesity-
Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT)
two studies. In both studies, participants’ daily
Model to guide the methods and outcomes to be tested across
affective feeling states and physical activity will be measured
using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and accelerometry at baseline and 2-, 6- and 12-weeks follow-
up. The Affect-Rx strategy will be refined for acceptability in Study 1 (N = 20) and tested (with refinements) in
Study 2 (N = 60). In consultation with her team of mentors and scientific advisors, the candidate will use the
training, the results of the research, and the ORBIT intervention development framework to systematically guide
the next steps in this affect-based physical activity promotion line of work and submit her first R01 proposal."
10793528,"The rate of aging of the breast differs between women. Further, older women tend to develop estrogen
receptor alpha (ERα) positive breast cancer sub-type, despite lower hormonal levels. Our preliminary data
compel us to hypothesize that mitochondrial genetics alters the rate of aging of the breast and impacts the sub-
type of breast cancer. The mammary ductal tree is composed of luminal hormone sensitive (HS), ERα positive
cells as well as luminal alveolar (AV) and basal cells that are both ERα negative. A recent scRNAseq analysis
revealed that in both the basal and luminal AV cells, mitochondrial function declines with age but this decline
was not observed in luminal HS cells. Rather, the luminal HS cells seem to up-regulate of the unfolded protein
response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPRER). The UPRER is closely interconnected with the mitochondrial
UPR (UPRmt). Our group has identified the ERα and the mitochondrial sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) as key players of the
UPRmt. While the level of the ERα does not fluctuate with age, in most individuals, SIRT3 levels decrease with
age. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that the decline in mitochondrial function observed in the basal and
luminal AV cells over aging may be due to the decline in the SIRT3 axis of the UPRmt. However, in the luminal
HS cells this decline is not observed as they maintain mitochondrial function through the ERα axis of the
UPRmt. We hypothesize that the ability of luminal HS cells to maintain mitochondrial function through aging,
allow them to survive transformation and explains the selective bias toward ERα positive breast cancer in older
women. Further, we performed RNAseq on the young and old-females derived mammary tumors and
established luminal HS cells derived from both young and aged females. We found that markers of the ER?
axis of the UPRmt and UPRER are up-regulated specifically in the aged luminal HS cells. This observation
suggests that the transcriptional program of the ER? may be altered by aging. We hypothesize that the
increase in ROS and the decline in hormones during aging alter the transcriptional program of the ERα.
Further, the rate of decline in SIRT3 with age varies between individuals. Likewise, we found that the levels of
SIRT3 differ between the BL/6NZB and BL/6C57 mice which have the same nuclear genome (BL/6), but different
mtDNA; (C57 or NZB). Therefore, the implication is that the rate of decline of the SIRT3 axis of the UPRmt with
age differs based on mtDNA haplotypes. Lastly, we hypothesize that while BL/6C57 mice (low SIRT3) will
develop exclusively ERα positive mammary tumor over aging, in BL/6NZB females (high SIRT3) both basal and
ER? positive mammary tumors will be observed. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following aims:
Specific aim 1: Analyze of the UPRmt and UPRER and the ERα transcriptome in ERα positive luminal mammary
cells over aging. Specific aim 2: Perform scRNAseq analysis of the mammary gland over aging in BL/6C57
and BL/6NZB mice. Specific aim 3: Compare the sub-types of mammary tumors between BL/6C57 and BL/6NZB
mice over aging. We propose to do these analyses in pre-, peri- and post-menopausal as well as elderly mice."
10891383,"“Therapeutic inertia,” defined as a lack of timely adjustment to therapy when a patient’s treatment goals are not
met, is a major cause of poor outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). This is especially true for low
socioeconomic status (low-SES) populations, who often face barriers to effective disease self-management at
three levels: (1) patient (e.g., limited resources, low health literacy, and limited access to care); (2) clinician
(e.g., lack of time and/or poor cultural sensitivity); and (3) health system (e.g., poor or absent decision support
and effective patient panel management). One way to address the complex challenges of chronic disease
management at these three levels is with multi-level health information technology (HIT)-supported behavioral
interventions. Such interventions combine changes to clinical workflows and self-management support to help
patients track diabetes electronically, transmit data to clinicians, and receive feedback for adjusting treatment.
Currently, minimal data exist to inform optimal design, implementation, and use of such multi-level behavioral
interventions, particularly for low-SES populations. My career goal is to establish an independently funded
research program that helps decrease health disparities using technologies that support effective long-term
self-management and improve outcomes. In this project, I propose a 5-year training and research plan for a
multi-level app-based intervention to improve outcomes for T2D in low-SES populations. I will develop and
pilot-test a nurse-led, app-based behavioral intervention consisting of three evidence-based interventions: (1)
education on A1C results and goal setting via MyChart, the patient portal in the Epic electronic health record;
(2) a problem-solving action plan developed by clinicians in collaboration with their patients; and (3) remote
monitoring via OnTrack, a top-rated diabetes app, to analyze blood glucose and identify the need to adjust
treatment. Training in population health informatics, HIT implementation science, health disparities, and
pragmatic trials will not only allow me to complete the proposed project, but will set the stage for expanding the
concept to other diseases and clinical use cases. Indiana University and the Regenstrief Institute, an
informatics powerhouse, plus a strong team of mentors in biomedical informatics, HIT implementation, health
disparity, and qualitative methods, provide an exceptional scientific environment. The proposed work includes:
(1) time-to-event analysis to understand population characteristics associated with persistent therapeutic
inertia, used to guide intervention development and tailoring [Aim 1]; (2) input from diabetes care team to adapt
the intervention and implementation strategies to the clinical operations level [Aim 2]; (3) a focus group study
with low-SES patients to help tailor the intervention [Aim 3]; and (4) a pilot study at two clinics (n=60, 30
patients per clinic) to assess the feasibility of the intervention for low-SES patients with insulin-treated
T2D [Aim 4]. The project will support a future R01 application for a pragmatic trial to assess the effectiveness
of a multi-level app-based behavioral intervention for low-SES populations with T2D."

The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns
are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread
epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine
protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood
cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc
and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and
evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will
parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation
will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed
using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high-
throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture
sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the
peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-,
12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development
using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique
longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop
preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed
work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is
quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning
techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA,
which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by
aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and
accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to
predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in
peripheral blood cells from OA patients."

Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) provide bacterial populations with an accessory genome, the “mobilome,” that
helps them survive antibiotics, phage infections, and other stresses. Understanding the core machinery encoded
by MGEs can help explain how accessory genes flow within a microbiome and can also reveal interesting new
enzymes, often with potential as biotech tools. Furthermore, MGE-encoded enzymes are often simplified or
modified variants of chromosomal machinery that, through comparison, can illuminate the evolution of both.
Mechanistic studies of MGEs have lagged far behind the bioinformatics.
Our work focuses on conserved machinery encoded by two families of staphylococcal MGEs that are of particular
importance to human health: SCCs, which are chromosomal islands implicated in the MRSA epidemic, and
pathogenicity islands. Our ongoing efforts have defined a set of conserved core SCC genes and assigned
biochemical activities to most of them, discovering new enzymes and following the interesting questions they
raised along the way. For example, we have discovered a new group of potentially anti-phage DNA glycosylases
and a new type of primase that raises the question of how it evolved as well as how DNA polymerases are
normally prevented from initiating DNA synthesis de novo. We also found that these MGEs encode helicases
with surprising similarity to the eukaryotic and archaeal MCM helicases, but with interestingly different pathways
for loading the helicase onto DNA at the origin of replication.
In addition to building on the work above, we will broaden our questions to the roles of SCC-encoded machinery
in phage defense, horizontal transfer, and copy number expansion. Recent advances in the field combined with
our biochemical groundwork position us to mechanistically dissect the horizontal transfer of SCCs to new strains.
We will also dissect the mechanism by which antibiotic resistance-carrying SCC elements can form tandem
repeats to increase resistance in response to antibiotic treatment."
10820442,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over the past two decades, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) has transformed from a case-reportable disease to
a major cause of upper gastrointestinal morbidity. EoE is primarily triggered by food, as diets eliminating
common food allergens can lead to long-term disease remission. However, accurate tests to identify food
triggers in individual patients do not yet exist because we do not fully understand the mechanisms of this food-
induced inflammation. We now know that this inflammation is not mediated by IgE, and diets based on IgE to
foods have had limited success. In contrast, another immunoglobulin — IgG4 — is produced locally in the
esophagus of EoE patients, and tissue levels of IgG4 correlate with disease activity. Using
immunofluorescence (IF), we have generated preliminary data that IgG4 and food proteins co-localize in the
esophageal tissue of EoE patients with active disease, which is suggestive of immune complex formation. We
have further found that these IgG4-food deposits are located in close proximity to proteins associated with
eosinophil activation, antigen presentation, and T cells. Defining a role for IgG4 in the pathogenesis of EoE
could fundamentally change our understanding of this condition — and of IgG4 — and could facilitate
the development of novel diagnostic tests and therapies for this disease.
Our overall hypothesis is that IgG4 contributes to food-induced inflammation in EoE. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether IgG4 forms immune complexes with food, which then promote high-avidity interactions to
activate eosinophils in the esophageal tissue of patients with food-induced EoE. In Aim 2, we will establish
whether dendritic cell activation by IgG4-bound antigen amplifies the underlying T cell immune response in
EoE. This will be assessed using 1) a validated milk challenge study where esophageal biopsies will be
collected from EoE patients in remission on diet and after milk reintroduction and 2) in vitro stimulation assays
using novel milk-specific IgG4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated from patients with EoE.
Our group is uniquely positioned to address this critical knowledge gap because of our access to large EoE
populations, our expertise in novel spatial and T cell phenotyping techniques, and our ability to generate IgG4
mAbs for in vitro assays. We expect to find that IgG4 contributes to food-induced inflammation in EoE.
Regardless of the outcomes, these results will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of food-induced
inflammation in EoE and may fundamentally change our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated tens of thousands of common variants with human
diseases and traits. The rapid expansion of Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) studies and biobanks offer
great potential to understand the physiologic and pathophysiologic associations of both common and rare
variants. The IGVF Consortium aims to systematically study the functional and phenotypic effects of genomic
variation; it is not, however, feasible to experimentally characterize the vast number of candidate variants of
interest. Computational models which can accurately predict the context-specific effects of variants are
essential in designing targeted research. We propose an approach anchored on a framework of
high-confidence regulatory elements (REs), from which we will develop methods to learn RE-gene links,
perform rare variant association tests, and finemap causal common and rare variants. We aim to make all our
results, methods, and tools available to the community through a public portal and the NHGRI and NHLBI Data
Commons. Our proposal has four aims: (1) Develop a core framework of REs from open chromatin regions on
which to anchor our models, improving on past approaches by producing higher-resolution predictions of
functional base-pairs, producing novel RE subclassifications using functional characterization datasets from
IGVF and other sources, and harnessing single-cell datasets to delineate lineage- and stimulus-specific
elements. (2) Use this framework to predict the roles of variants in molecular phenotypes, specifically gene
expression and cellular response to stimuli. We will build statistical and machine-learning methods to predict
context-specific links between REs and their target genes, using three-dimensional conformation data
produced by the IGVF Consortium and external sources. We will apply this method across many cell types and
perform feature selection to build a catalog of high-confidence RE-gene links and regulatory networks. (3)
Develop statistical methods to perform cell type-specific rare variant association tests (cellSTAAR) in WGS
studies, and a latent variable model to prioritize candidate functional variants for traits and diseases, using
results from Aims 1 and 2. We will apply these methods to analyze various metabolic, immune-mediated, and
psychiatric disorders in the multi-ethnic WGS data of the NHLBI Trans-Omic Precision Medicine Program
(TOPMed) and the NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) to identify candidate causal
disease-associated variants. (4) Make all the results publicly available by substantially expanding the FAVOR
Portal to include whole genome variant functional annotations of all three billion genomic positions as well as
cell type-specific annotations. We will implement both FAVOR and cellSTAAR in the Data Commons AnVIL
(NHGRI) and BioData Catalyst (NHLBI) so researchers may use them for analysis of new datasets in a
scalable cloud computing environment. We will work closely with other centers and the Data Analysis
Coordinating Center (DACC) of the IGVF on joint analyses and building the IGVF Variant Catalog."
10877694,"Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common glaucoma subtype, is a prototypical common
complex disease with a strong polygenetic component. This proposal is aligned with the NIH roadmap,
leveraging the decade-long effort of gene discovery for POAG into precision medicine approaches that
facilitate an early glaucoma diagnosis while outlining strategies to prevent glaucoma-related blindness. In this
study, we propose 3 specific aims. 1) We will assemble all of the common gene variants discovered for POAG
over the past decade into a multi-ancestry panel to test whether they predict glaucoma in 4 independent study
populations (the UK Biobank, a health professional case-control study embedded in a population based
sample, and patients from 2 hospital-based biobanks (total sample size: over 12,000 POAG cases in ~600,286
subjects). 2) Hospital-based biobanks offer an opportunity to contributed precision based medical knowledge
about glaucoma. We will invite 800 patients from two hospital-based biobanks with low and high glaucoma
polygenetic risk score (PRS) for systematic clinical evaluation. This detailed phenotype-genotype correlation
will provide unique insights into glaucoma and will demonstrate the utility of such biobanks to identify
previously undiagnosed disease, an unmet need in the field of glaucoma. 3) While a glaucoma PRS is
probably the strongest predictor of glaucoma, we anticipate that a considerable number of subjects with high
PRS will not demonstrate glaucomatous disease; conversely, some subjects with low PRS will have glaucoma.
We will explore whether genetic variants such as MYOC Q368X and unique environmental factors (dietary
nitrate intake from vegetable sources, estrogen exposure duration in women and dental health status) modify
the relation between our PRS and glaucoma in our 4 study populations. By formulating and applying a multi-
ancestral glaucoma PRS to an ethnically-diverse group of subjects, this proposal will highlight the role of a
glaucoma genetic informativity panel as a screening tool. This proposal will advance the major objective of
promoting POAG to the status of a precision-based medicine discipline. Finally, it will identify specific disease
prevention strategies that could be implemented before a diagnosis is made."
10849658,"ABSTRACT
 Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness that affects over 50 million people worldwide.
Approximately one-third of patients do not respond to anti-seizure medication (ASM) and require additional
diagnostic work-up, including consideration for surgery. Structural neuroimaging plays a pivotal role in the
diagnostic evaluation of epilepsy, identifying visible lesions in many patients that co-localize with the seizure
focus. However, up to 40% of patients have normal-appearing MRIs and this number is growing. As a result,
there is increased interest in identifying subtle brain network abnormalities that could help to delineate the
epileptogenic network and aid in the prediction of treatment response (i.e., response to ASMs and surgical
outcomes). Unfortunately, methods for reliably identifying which patients will be drug-responsive versus drug-
resistant, and which patients will achieve successful versus unsuccessful surgical outcomes are lacking.
 A major barrier to progress in this field has been obtaining quantitative imaging, including structural MRI
(sMRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (dMRI), clinical, and genetic data on large, geographically diverse
samples of patients in whom different treatment outcomes can be evaluated. In the past, sample sizes have
been insufficient to detect subtle, but reliable, brain abnormalities in patients with focal or generalized
epilepsies that are genuinely associated with epilepsy and not with vicissitudes related to small or
geographically restricted samples.
 A new, large-scale data initiative, ENIGMA4-Epilepsy, coupled with technological advancements that
enable improved data harmonization are now lifting these barriers and allowing us to combine multi-site
sMRI/dMRI, clinical, genetic data to predict important clinical outcomes, and making the results generalizable
to a global epilepsy community. In this grant, we will leverage data collected through ENIGMA-Epilepsy—a
consortium of 24 epilepsy centers from 14 countries (more than 2,250 patient and 1,727 healthy control
sMRI/dMRI datasets) and the Human Epilepsy Project (HEP). We will include new network models (i.e.,
individualized connectomes) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) to test whether a combination of imaging,
clinical, and genetic risk can accurately predict two clinical outcomes: drug-resistance and post-operative
seizure outcome. Our scientific premise is that MRI-based assessment of whole-brain network properties, in
combination with clinical data and PRS derived from genetic data, are able to predict (i) drug response in
recently diagnosed epilepsy cases and (ii) postsurgical outcomes in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy.
 This R01 addresses NIH's call for more reproducible studies by introducing a highly-powered design
capable of capturing variability across patients with diverse clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes.
This grant is also directly aligned with NINDS's 2020 Epilepsy Benchmarks (IIIB), which encourage the
identification of genetic, clinical, and imaging biomarkers capable of predicting treatment response in epilepsy."

The Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute’s (CCTSI) T32 Pre-Doctoral Training Program
aligns and supports the goals of NCATS to ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in
adequate numbers and in appropriate research areas to carry out the nation’s clinical and translational science
research (CTSR) agenda. Our proposed Team Oriented Training across the Translational Sciences
Spectrum (TOTTS) program will support trainees’ competency development and foster characteristic
development for translational research scientists. We request 8 slots for diverse trainees that represent the
translational spectrum (biomedical/bioengineering PhD students, population health/health outcomes PhD
students, clinician doctoral students) to complete our 2-year program, with clinician doctoral students having a
1-year option. Our overall goal is to meet the needs of the translational science and research community by
preparing diverse interdisciplinary doctoral trainees that are team oriented and have developed characteristics
and associated skills necessary for successful CTSR careers, including Domain Expert, Rigorous Researcher,
Boundary Crosser, Process Innovator, Team Player, Skilled Communicator, and Systems Thinker. Our
program’s value is that Diversity Accelerates Research and Translation (DART). Integration into the clinical
and translational fabric strengthens a person’s connection, self-efficacy, and identity formation, thus increasing
the likelihood that T32 trainees remain in the translational workforce. Our program’s curriculum and
approaches are based on our colleague’s conceptual framework for diversifying the CTSR workforce, Model
for Persistence of a Diverse Clinical and Translational Research Workforce. A program objective is to
apply evidence informed mentoring practices to support developing trainees from all backgrounds for
career persistence and success in CTSR. Evidence informed practices to be applied include 1) signed
mentoring agreements, 2) development and regular review of Individualized Career Development Plans, 3)
completion of Mentoring3: Mentor, Mentee and Peer, an effective mentoring training program attended by both
mentors and mentees, 4) annual mentor-mentee dyad reviews with feedback, and 5) trainee Mentoring
Advisory Team reviews. Several programmatic elements are novel to promote skills development and
successful transitions into careers as translational scientists: translational mentor supported immersion
experiences (clinical, industry, community, lab), Leading and Teaming, Writing Accountability Groups, F-Grant
Review and Mock Study Section, Communicating Research to the Public, and Café Scientifiques. Evaluative
emphasis will be placed on our ability to achieve our goal of attracting and supporting the training and
persistence of individuals from diverse (especially underrepresented) backgrounds who have the potential to
infuse CTSR with new perspectives and approaches that are efficient and effective."

The continuing HIV epidemic in the U.S. remains a critical health issue for young priority populations bearing a
disproportionate burden of infection. Daily oral PrEP (and as of December 2021, a long-acting injectable
cabotegravir) is safe and effective in reducing the risk of sexual HIV acquisition in adults and adolescents, yet
PrEP awareness/usage remains low. Accordingly, interventions are sorely needed to address PrEP awareness
and mitigate potential barriers related to PrEP use. One such intervention modality is social media (SM), as HIV
knowledge, PrEP awareness, and communicating issues, such as access and cost, are easily addressable via
clear SM messages on platforms young people already use frequently. Given that PrEP awareness/usage
remains low and that SM may be a viable intervention modality for increasing PrEP facilitators and reducing
barriers, the overall objective of this proposed exploratory research project is to 1) characterize the SM landscape
regarding PrEP and HIV prevention messages and 2) develop new and improved behavioral theory-based
messages about PrEP that are clear, specific, consistent, and scientifically up to date. With a robust and
multidisciplinary team across 2 institutions, we will accomplish this objective via 3 SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1:
Characterize PrEP-related communications across 3 popular social media platforms (Facebook,
Instagram, and Twitter), identifying message and source characteristics. Using content analytic methods,
we will access, human code, and analyze publicly available PrEP-related SM posts/messages, describing
features of messages, posters/users, and social networks. AIM 2: Build a predictive, explainable health
communication model, guided by the Multilevel Model of Meme Diffusion (M3D), to determine the
diffusion potential of PrEP-related messages. We will apply machine learning methods to characterize PrEP
message features; develop/evaluate a predictive model of a message diffusion potential using large-scale
training data; and apply the model to predict a set of online diffusion metrics for a given message and assess its
ability to reach online PrEP-relevant populations. AIM 3: Develop and pilot test PrEP promotion messages,
for several young priority populations, for implementation/evaluation in a future project. Using human-
centered design (HCD) principles, we will engage 2-3 end-user segments in iterative rounds of SM message
development and testing. This proposed R21 will yield a deeper understanding of PrEP promotion messaging
on SM and produce a “library of messages,” tailored for several young priority populations at risk for HIV. Such
messages will be empirically tested in a future R01 project, and assessed for evidence of behavior change (i.e.,
PrEP usage). Such knowledge may be employed in innovative/targeted efforts via well-liked and accessible
digital tools, such as SM, effectively supporting the updated National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the U.S."
10847391,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:
A central aspect of cell division is the faithful segregation of chromosomes. Errors in chromosome segregation
are the leading cause of miscarriages, and are associated with the vast majority of tumor cells. Despite this, we
know very little about why this process is so defective in these circumstances, in large part because the
molecules and mechanisms involved are not fully defined. A highly conserved protein complex, the kinetochore,
physically attaches chromosomes to the spindle microtubules that are central to pulling chromosomes apart
every time a cell divides. Doing this accurately requires kinetochores to remain persistently attached to a
constantly changing substrate, the dynamically growing and shrinking tips of the spindle microtubules. They must
also sense when they’re improperly attached and self-correct these errors. How kinetochores carry out these
dynamic functions remains largely mysterious. We propose to investigate two key aspects of the kinetochore-
microtubule interface. First, we know that the ability to sense tension (mechano-sensing) is vital for monitoring
erroneous attachments of chromosomes to the spindle. Yet, how mechanical forces are sensed by and
transmitted through this megadalton protein assembly is poorly understood. Second, the kinetochore’s ability to
specifically recognize and bind to various microtubule tip structures is also crucial. How the microtubule side of
this interface impacts kinetochore attachment fidelity is unknown, and has remained largely unstudied.
Understanding these critical questions has proven challenging because of the lack of ways to measure and
manipulate the kinetochore’s highly dynamic activities. Prior studies utilized mainly genetic and cell biological
approaches, relying on downstream functional readouts that do not directly monitor protein activity. We use an
innovative and fundamentally different strategy, combining cutting-edge biochemical and biophysical tools to
reconstitute the activities of these protein machines in vitro. The ability to reconstitute these activities allows us
to examine both sides of this interface, making our approach uniquely capable of addressing these fundamental
questions in innovative ways. Capitalizing on my groundwork in which I identified the first factor, Stu2chTOG,
required for a novel mechano-sensing pathway, we have now determined its exact kinetochore binding site via
structural analysis and developed genetic tools allowing us to perturb and inducibly re-localize it to kinetochores.
We will use these tools to expand insight into the mechanisms of mechano-sensing and extend our knowledge
of the factors involved. We will also examine which kinetochore activities are affected by alterations to its
microtubule substrate. We have identified numerous tubulin mutations that specifically disrupt chromosome
segregation, and our reconstitution-based assays now give us the unique ability to understand this
mechanistically. This approach constitutes the first direct examination of the microtubule side of this interface. I
anticipate this work will greatly increase our understanding of how kinetochores work to segregate chromosomes
and how defects arise in human disease."
10844476,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Water enables life. So much so that the search for extraterrestrial life is a search for liquid water. However,
terrestrial drug discovery still, by and large, ignores water molecules. The reason lies in the complexity and
versatility of its contributions to biomolecular interactions, despite its apparent simplicity. My prior research has
investigated the role of water in ligand recognition and selectivity, and its utility to improve ligand discovery.
Recently, my lab has established a link between the mobility of water networks and the affinity of ligand binding
to proteins. More generally, the work highlights the exploitable sensitivity of water networks in response to
changes in protein and ligand. My long-term goal is to link atomic-scale water wiggles to changes in the protein
conformational landscape and ultimately to organismal fitness. To achieve this, I aspire to pave the path to a
more dynamic view of protein function that integrates currently neglected aspects of protein flexibility and
hydration. This is important because cryogenic structures, which make up 95% of the Protein Data Bank,
deliver a contorted, static image which is then used to design ligands. The objective of the proposed work is to
formulate a pragmatic framework that defines and utilizes water network dynamics. As water is ubiquitously
found at all biological interfaces, the concept extends beyond protein-ligand interactions to many fields,
including protein-protein interactions, allostery, protein evolution and resistance.
My central hypothesis is that we can use the exquisite sensitivity of water molecules to contextual changes in
our favor. The hypothesis that water fluctuations report on changes in dynamic features will be exploited in
three specific areas via perturbation with 1) temperature, 2) mutation and 3) ligands. 1) Re-defining water
networks in protein structures: I hypothesize that physiological temperatures provide a less distorted view of
water networks within protein crystals than structures obtained using common cryogenic freezing. We will test
the hypothesis by solving crystal structures of proteins over a range of temperatures. By exposing freezing
artifacts, we can reveal hidden changes in water network dynamics that can be used productively to predict
binding affinities. 2) Exploring isoform-specific differences in water networks: I hypothesize that by using water
perturbations as a reporter for change, we can distinguish near-identical Hsp90 isoforms. We will test the
hypothesis by tracking how co-evolved water networks respond to perturbations in a context-dependent
manner. This will expose subtle differences in isoforms that the Hsp90 field has struggled to exploit for
decades to explore differential isoform biology in disease. 3) Considering water network dynamics in ligand
discovery: I hypothesize that including experimental water network terms will improve computational docking.
Based on our previous success of including computationally derived solvation energies, we expect that this will
lead to novel Hsp90 ligands that minimize water perturbation, which cannot be discovered otherwise."

Neuroscience PhD training has been a component of graduate student training at Wake Forest University for
approximately 28 years. The field of Neuroscience is at the cutting edge of scientific developments and the
Wake Forest Neuroscience Program believes its long-term returns from student training will have positive
consequences for our community and nation. Neurological disorders associated with trauma, an aging
population, drug addiction, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders represent urgent local and national
needs. Immediate action is required. As scientists and educators, we have a responsibility to train individuals
capable of pioneering research into both normal development and function of the nervous system and into the
causes and mechanisms underlying neurological disease.
The goal of our Neuroscience training program is to provide students with
 a) A fundamental understanding of all levels of nervous system organization, from genetics, molecular, and
 cellular to systems and behavioral,
 b) The skill set that includes extensive training in experimental design and interpretation, statistical and
 quantitative methodology and hands on experience in state of the art laboratories to carry out meaningful
 and significant research in all areas of modern neuroscience, and
 c) An appreciation of the importance of how basic neuroscience research is key to finding treatments for
 neurobehavioral pathologies.
This is achieved because the first, two years the program focus on providing students with the broad-based,
interdisciplinary training that includes a balance of coursework with essential hands-on lab research training.
With this foundation in place, students move forward using the next few years to investigate and develop a
thesis project in a specific neuroscience subdiscipline such as memory and cognition, addiction and motivated
behaviors, sensory integration, or nervous system changes following injury or in disease. Our program’s
success occurs because in addition to an established advisory structure, students are exposed to a research
setting in which collaborations and interactions among investigators using different techniques and approaches
is commonplace. Additionally, while preparation for a research career in the Neurosciences remains a central
focus of our program, we consider it essential for students to have access to teaching, outreach and other
professional experiences to be fully cognizant of the increasing opportunities for both non-academic and non-
research careers that utilize their scientific and scholarly training."
10839975,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Opioid use disorder (OUD) causes significant morbidity and mortality in the United States. Efficacious
pharmacotherapies that can be delivered in a primary care or specialty clinic setting have been developed but
most patients with OUD do not receive them. In recent years, three kinds of long-acting medication for OUD
(MOUD) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): monthly injectable naltrexone
(2010), six-monthly implantable buprenorphine (2016) and monthly injectable buprenorphine (2017). These
modalities have several theoretical advantages over daily buprenorphine or methadone – e.g., stabilizes
dosing, reduces frequency of follow-up visits, prevents diversion – but their uptake and dissemination in real-
world settings have not been characterized. The proposed research will investigate provider- and systems-
level barriers and facilitators to adoption of long-acting MOUD. In this mentored career development award
(K01), Dr. Shover will characterize clinicians who are early adopters of long-acting MOUD, identify context-
specific barriers and facilitators to prescribing and administering long-acting MOUD, and longitudinally
compare dissemination of long-acting MOUD to that of daily MOUD. In Aim 1, Dr. Shover will use insurance
claims data to characterize individual and organizational attributes of providers who prescribe long-acting
buprenorphine or naltrexone to treat OUD in the first year of their FDA approval. In Aim 2, Dr. Shover will
conduct qualitative interviews with primary care physicians, pain medicine physicians, and psychiatrists to
identify subjective factors that influence willingness or capacity to prescribe long-acting MOUD. In Aim 3, Dr.
Shover will conduct a longitudinal analysis of dissemination of long-acting MOUD in their first five years,
comparing geographic and systems-level patterns diffusion to those of daily oral MOUD. Through the award,
Dr. Shover will build on her doctoral training as an epidemiologist and experience in substance use policy and
community-based HIV prevention to develop new skills needed to conduct impactful addiction health services
research. These skills will include working with claims data, qualitative interviewing, implementation science,
grant-writing, and scientific communication. Through coursework, clinical observation in psychiatry and pain
medicine clinics, mentorship, and external conferences and workshops, Dr. Shover will gain the skills needed
to apply for her first R01 and pursue a career as a tenure-track principal investigator."
10840822,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Organogenesis requires the execution of interwoven patterning processes that sculpt the distinct functional
components of an organ with exquisite specificity. In the context of the embryonic heart, specific territories
within each cardiac chamber take on unique attributes: for example, the pacemaker cells that reside within the
atrial inflow tract (IFT) have particular conductive properties that are integral to their role in initiating the
heartbeat. Cardiac pacemaking activity must be confined to a discrete region of the heart in order to avoid
arrhythmia, but we do not yet fully understand the genetic pathways that define the dimensions of the IFT.
How are an appropriate number of specialized cardiomyocytes established at the IFT? Prior studies have
shown that IFT progenitor cells inhabit discrete outlying regions of the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (ALPM).
Moreover, we have demonstrated that canonical Wnt signaling is active in these outlying regions and that the
ligand Wnt5b acts to drive IFT differentiation. Thus, Wnt signaling plays a key role in promoting IFT
development, but we do not yet understand how Wnt pathway activity is restricted to the edges of the ALPM.
Here, we propose to utilize the suite of genetic and embryological approaches available in the zebrafish in
order to identify essential patterning mechanisms that constrain IFT dimensions.
Importantly, our preliminary studies suggest that the number of IFT cardiomyocytes is constrained through a
two-phase process, with distinct signaling pathways operating at successive developmental stages. First, in
the early embryo, we propose that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling restricts the allocation of progenitor cells into the
IFT lineage. Later, in the ALPM, we propose that Fgf signaling reinforces constraints on the number of IFT
cardiomyocytes by restricting the distribution of Wnt signaling. Together, our preliminary data highlight
previously unappreciated roles for both Hh and Fgf signaling and suggest a novel model for the molecular
mechanisms that restrict the size of the IFT. To test this model, we will employ loss- and gain-of-function
analysis, fate mapping, and mosaic analysis in order to (1) determine whether Hedgehog signaling constrains
specification of IFT progenitor cells and (2) ascertain whether Fgf signaling constrains differentiation of IFT
cardiomyocytes. In addition, our model predicts that IFT progenitor cells possess distinct molecular
characteristics prior to their overt differentiation into IFT cardiomyocytes. To test this, we will (3) define the
developmental path of IFT progenitors by integrating spatial and transcriptomic data, thereby revealing how the
signaling pathways that specify the IFT lineage set the stage for differentiation of the IFT myocardium.
Taken together, our proposed studies will provide novel insight into the network of signaling pathways that
control IFT dimensions, thereby illuminating new paradigms for the regulation of cardiac patterning. Moreover,
our work has the potential to shed light on the developmental origins of congenital cardiac conduction
disorders and may also facilitate future innovations in regenerative medicine."

Graduate education has traditionally been successful in educating students in either engineering or the
biomedical sciences, but the disparate nature of the scientific and engineering backgrounds necessary to
successfully move the gene and cell therapy field forward requires novel educational approaches and methods
that integrate these disciplines. With small molecule and protein therapies well-established in the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, gene and cell therapy represent the next generation of
therapeutics to address serious unmet medical need. Because these therapeutics involve the delivery of DNA
– in the form of genes or entire genomes – they have the potential to provide long-term therapeutic benefit
following a single administration. However, the gene and cell therapy field face complex biological and
technological challenges. Delivery of genetic constructs, either in vitro or in vivo, must be improved, and in
addition therapeutic payloads including CRISPR/Cas9 and other genome editing machinery requires improved
potency. In addition, cellular targets including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs), and adult stem cells are difficult to precisely control, since the repertoire of signals and cues that
naturally control stem cell self-renewal and differentiation are not well understood, yet precise control is
essential to unlocking applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The University of
California at Berkeley has developed the highly interdisciplinary Biology and Biotechnology of Cell and
Gene Therapy (BBCGT) Training Program. With the involvement and support of our 24 faculty, the Berkeley
Stem Cell Center, Bioengineering Department, Molecular and Cell Biology Department, and Helen Wills
Neuroscience Institute, we have designed and have been successfully implementing a program to support the
education and training of predoctoral fellows in gene and cell therapy. This newly emerging discipline
represents the convergence of the biological and biomedical sciences, physical sciences, engineering, and
ethics. The primary objectives of our program have therefore been to formally organize the structure and scope
of new training opportunities in this rapidly expanding discipline, to dissolve traditional academic barriers to
interdisciplinary graduate science education, and to provide strong research training in academia and industry.
As part of these efforts, we will immerse trainees in a Biology and Biotechnology of Cell and Gene Therapy
curriculum, training in the responsible conduct of research, seminar series, annual retreat, interdisciplinary
research, career development resources, industrial internship experience, and participation in a recruitment
and retention plan to enhance diversity. The resulting program will be highly effective in training young
scientists to work at the interface of the biomedical sciences and engineering in a rapidly-evolving, impactful,
and timely area of biomedical research."
10840297,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the significant burden that viral infections continue to impose on human health, effective therapeutics
and vaccines are still unavailable for many viral pathogens. A stronger understanding of the mechanisms by
which the immune system senses and controls viral infections will enable the development of new strategies for
their prevention and treatment. Interferons (IFN) are critical mediators of the immune response to viral infections,
but excessive amounts can lead to chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. The production of IFN is therefore
tightly regulated. Replicating viruses produce RNAs that are detected within cells by RNA sensors, RIG-I and
MDA5. RIG-I detects viruses such as Sendai virus (SeV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), whereas MDA5 is
essential for IFN induction to control picornaviruses such as Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV),
and the Calicivirus, murine norovirus (MNoV). Once activated, these sensors initiate a common signaling
cascade that leads to the transcriptional induction of IFN and establishes an anti-viral environment. Although
the Linear Ubiquitin Chain Assembly Complex (LUBAC) has been shown previously to inhibit IFN
induction by RIG-I, our studies have shown that LUBAC subunit, HOIL1, is essential for IFN induction by
MDA5 in murine dendritic cells and fibroblasts, and to control MNoV infection in vivo. Furthermore, we
have found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HOIL1 is essential for IFN induction during TMEV infection of
fibroblasts. However, the mechanism by which HOIL1 E3 ligase activity regulates MDA5-dependent IFN
induction, and the biological consequences of ubiquitination by HOIL1 are unknown. We hypothesize that HOIL1
and LUBAC are recruited selectively to the MDA5 signaling pathway, wherein HOIL1 catalyzes ubiquitination of
one or more signaling molecules in the pathway to facilitate signal transduction and transcription of IFN genes.
First, we will determine the location of the blockade in the MDA5 signaling cascade in HOIL1 E3 ligase mutant
cells, and identify other LUBAC protein domains that regulate MDA5 signaling and IFN induction. Second, we
will use both candidate and unbiased biochemical approaches to identify HOIL1-interactors and ubiquitinated
proteins during MDA5 signaling. Last, we will test whether HOIL1 E3 ligase activity differentially regulates IFN
induction and viral pathogenesis in vivo during MNoV, SeV, VSV and TMEV infection of mice, and will use cell
type-specific knock-out mice to identify the cell types that require HOIL1 to induce IFN and control MNoV
persistent infection in vivo. We expect our studies to identify a novel mechanism of IFN regulation, thereby
revealing potential therapeutic targets for viral and IFN-mediated autoimmune diseases."

pregnancy and infertility. Antibiotics cure infection but may not ameliorate disease and a vaccine is urgently
needed. Success in preclinical animal studies is essential for vaccines to move to human clinical trials. Pigs are
affordable, highly biologically relevant, and the natural host to the prevalent pathogen Chlamydia suis (Cs) – a
chlamydia species closely related to Ct. Pigs are also susceptible to Ct; and protective CD4 T cells from Cs pre-
exposed pigs cross-react to Ct. This cross-reaction makes Cs pre-exposed pigs a highly valuable animal model
for Ct vaccine development: Vaccination of Cs-pre-exposed outbred pigs can simulate Ct vaccination of Ct pre-
exposed humans – the target population of clinical phase III Ct vaccination trials. Dr. Kaeser has expertise in
performing Cs and Ct vaccination and challenge trials in Cs pre-exposed pigs and in detailed analyses of Ct
infection and immunity. Our long-term goal is to use this model to develop Ct vaccines and to offer the model to
other researchers as a Ct vaccine testing platform. This study has two main goals: Use Cs pre-exposed pigs to
develop a Ct vaccine candidate with novel vaccine formulations and Ct antigens, and provide an in-depth
understanding of protective vaccine-induced immune mechanisms.
The study is divided into three phases: Phase I will determine the most immunogenic parenteral/mucosal, prime/
boost vaccination strategy using whole-cell inactivated Ct either in a nanoemulsion or adjuvanted with the TriAdj
adjuvant. Phase II will then use the most immunogenic vaccination strategy to determine the immunogenicity of
proven and novel antigen combinations – likely MOMP, CFAMP, OmcB, and pgp3. Vaccine immunogenicity and
the humoral and cell mediated immune responses will be analyzed both systemically and locally using state-of-
the art technologies including multi-peptide antibody ELISAs, multi-color T cell flow cytometry, tissue clearance
in combination with fluorescent immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNAseq analyses of adaptive T cells.
These first two phases will develop our vaccine candidate - the most immunogenic vaccination strategy and Ct
antigen combination. In Phase III, we will test the efficacy and immunogenicity of this vaccine candidate in two
identical animal trials, demonstrating rigor and reproducibility to evaluate our Ct vaccine candidate.
This study will contribute in three ways to further Ct vaccine research and human health: i) It will improve our
understanding of the immune response relevant for protection against Ct; ii) it will develop a novel Ct vaccine
candidate; iii) it will provide a proof-of-principle vaccination study to fully establish the Cs pre-exposed pig model.
This highly relevant large animal model can be used to test new candidates and improve on current regimens
with the goal to develop a vaccine that results in sterilizing immunity in humans."

Thymic T cell development produces peripheral T cell receptor repertoires with significant residual reactivity
against our self-antigens. Several mechanisms have emerged to manage this self-reactivity and prevent overt
auto-immunity, including T cell anergy and deletion, as well as the activities of regulatory T cells. Failure of
such tolerance mechanisms is thought to underlie many autoimmune disease.
In studying the naive CD8+ T cell pool in mice, we have recently observed that a fraction of naive T cells are –
under homeostatic conditions – exposed to active TGF-b during MHC-I-dependent interactions with migratory
dendritic cells in lymph nodes. This TGF-b exposure pre-conditions naive CD8+ T cells to efficiently form
epithelial-resident memory T cells (eTRM) upon immune challenges, such as skin vaccination against viral
pathogens. When this pre-conditioning process is disrupted, e.g. in the absence of lymph nodes, by preventing
dendritic cell migration to lymph nodes, or by deleting TGF-b-activating aV-integrins in dendritic cells, formation
of eTRM in skin is strongly reduced, causing diminished antiviral protection.
In preliminary studies for this project we have discovered that homeostatic TGF-b conditioning occurs
preferentially in weakly self-reactive CD8+ T cells, while more strongly self-reactive cells are not conditioned.
Mechanistically, TCR-dependent ERK activity appears to restrict TGF-b signaling through an inhibitory
phosphorylation of the linker region in Smad2 and Smad3 transcription factors that prevents their nuclear
translocation and effects on gene transcription.
Based on these observations we hypothesize that homeostatic TGF-b signals that condition naive CD8+ T cells
for the formation of long-lived epithelial resident memory cells are restricted to cells that pose the lowest risk of
causing autoimmunity. In this project we will test this hypothesis by comparing TCR self-reactivity in naive
CD8+ T cells as well as the eTRM pools in skin and other barrier tissues, and by examining epigenetic changes
that characterize conditioned naive T cells and their relation to gene programs activated during eTRM
differentiation. If our hypothesis is confirmed, our studies could reveal a new mechanism by which auto-
reactivity in the peripheral TCR repertoire is managed. Breakdown of this mechanism could underlie
autoimmune diseases that manifest in barrier tissues such as the skin."

About 12 million individuals over the age of 12 have a substance use disorder (SUD). Cocaine is involved 
in about 1 in 5 overdoses in the United States and is abused by both men and women. Women are more 
vulnerable to the rewarding effects of cocaine and more rapidly progress from initial use to dependence than 
men but the neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to these differences are yet to be determined. A 
limitation of the current work investigating sex differences in preclinical research is that the research is primarily 
focused on hormonal contributions that may be driving sex differences. There is little understanding of how sex 
steroids and other neurobiological mechanisms contribute to cocaine dependence. The overall goal of this 
project is to identify the effects of a history of cocaine self-administration on sex steroids and nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) subunit expression and to test the hypothesis that decreased nAChRs 
alpha 5 (ɑ5) in the dorsal hippocampus (dHIPP) produced by decreased progesterone levels promote 
cocaine self-administration behavior. Aim 1 will use single-cell transcriptomics to identify sex differences in 
the dysregulated transcriptional networks in rats with a history of compulsive-like cocaine self-administration 
using brain (dHIPP), adrenal, pituitary, reproductive organ samples. Aim 2 will causally investigate the role of 
the nAChR ɑ5 in the dHIPP and progesterone on cocaine self-administration behavior using an AAV-ShRNA to 
knock down nAChRs ɑ5 in the dHIPP and pharmacology to block the progesterone receptor. These projects will 
be the first to look at associations between sex steroids and nAChR ɑ5 in the dHIPP on cocaine selfadministration in both sexes. My Sponsor, Dr. Olivier George (UCSD) is an expert on the neurobiology of drugs 
of abuse and addiction and is recognized as an innovative leader in the field of drug abuse and, therefore, the 
perfect fit to mentor me for the proposed research. The proposed Research and Training Plans will deepen my 
knowledge of transcriptomics, the cholinergic system, the hippocampus, and neuroendocrinology in addictionlike phenotypes and will expand my expertise in cocaine dependency. The training I will receive in single-cell 
transcriptomics, ELISAs, bioinformatics, intrajugular catheter surgeries, and advanced operant paradigms will 
give me the skills necessary to answer questions focused on cell-specific differences in males and females that 
may be driving dysregulation of reward circuitry pre- and post-drug exposure. The training I have received in the 
F99 phase and the training I will receive in the K00 phase will allow me to establish a lab where I can research 
my long-term research goal of investigating the mechanisms underlying maladaptive addiction behaviors and 
how these behaviors differentiate by sex."

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a prevalent genetic cardiac disease affecting 1 in every 300-500 people.
The disease is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte disarray, and interstitial fibrosis
resulting in impaired diastolic function often with preserved or enhances systolic function. Dilated
cardiomyopathy (DCM) has a similar occurrence and is characterized by thinning of one or both ventricular walls
producing insufficient systolic function and diminished ejection fraction, hallmarks of a failing heart. Genetic
mutations in sarcomere proteins have been identified to be associated with HCM and DCM, with mutations in -
cardiac myosin (MYH7) strongly implicated as drivers of both conditions. A widely cited model relating myosin
function to disease proposes that HCM arises from myosin mutations that enhance activity yielding
hypercontractile myocytes, whereas DCM arises from loss-of-function mutations that diminish activity yielding
hypo-contractility. Contractile abnormalities are proposed to be due to MYH7 gene mutations that affect ATPase
activity, velocity, force production, the number or availability of motor domains, and thin filament activation. These
molecular changes ultimately affect power output in a manner that impacts tissue architecture,
electrophysiological signaling, and cardiac performance. Emerging research has provided examples that do not
fit clearly into the prevailing model. For example, HCM mutations with decreased activity have been described
in molecular assays and at the level of isolated myofibrils. To delineate the mechanisms by which myosin
mutations lead to HCM and DCM, it is important to determine how changes in protein sequence lead to changes
in activity at both the molecular and ensemble levels. We selected specific HCM and DCM mutations that are
predicted to affect the mechanochemistry of the myosin motor. Our goal is to determine the effect of these
mutations on myosin activity, and to test whether the HCM gain-of-function and DCM loss-of-function paradigm
holds. We will utilize biochemical and biophysical approaches to assess the effect of mutations on the activity of
single motors and regulated filament assemblies. Aim 1 will determine the biochemical and mechanical effects
of key HCM and DCM mutations in human β-cardiac myosin. We will measure the ensemble kinetics and motility
using biochemical and gliding assays. Changes in unitary forces, step-size, and force dependent kinetic steps
will be measured using single molecule optical-trapping. Aim 2 will determine the effect of HCM/DCM mutations
on heterogenous myosin assembles and thin filament activation. We will examine the effect the regulation of
single molecules within a regulated system, and we will construct a myosin nanomachine using DNA origami
that mimics cardiac muscle. We will use regulated thin filaments and myofilaments containing defined ratios of
WT and mutant myosin. We expect that our approach will result in an unprecedented understanding of the
underlying etiology of HCM and DCM."

 Protein synthesis is a key metabolic step in cells that is subjected to perturbations from internal stimuli
or external agents that may sometimes lead to the pausing of translating ribosomes on messenger RNAs, a
phenomenon defined as ribosome stalling. Interestingly, the gram-negative bacterium Legionella pneumophila
(L.p.) manipulates several critical host processes such as protein synthesis and membrane transport to
establish its replicative niche in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like vacuole. L.p. achieves this by injecting
effector proteins via its type IV secretion system, Dot/Icm. Understanding how bacteria sabotage host
processes and manipulate them to their own advantage provides invaluable insights into disease and
mammalian cell biology. Recent studies have highlighted that L.p secretes toxins into infected cells that can
inhibit protein synthesis and induce ribosome stalling. Cells have evolved a conserved mechanism called
ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) that aids in the sensing and resolution of stalled ribosomes and the
maintenance of protein homeostasis. The consequences of ribosome stalling stress to cells however remain
poorly understood. By challenging the cellular translation apparatus with infections of L.p. or sub-optimal doses
of translation elongation inhibitors, we have determined that the sensing of stalled ribosomes in cells activates
a transcriptional and translational program that leads to the upregulation of the activating transcription factor 3
(ATF3). We have determined that this reactionary program is independent from other canonical stress
response pathways such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) or the integrated stress response (ISR).
Strikingly, ATF3 is regulated by L.p. derived proteins SidI and SusF, a toxin-antitoxin couple. The targets of
SidI and SusF in cells are undefined. Furthermore, the upregulation of ATF3 was dependent on multiple
components of the RQC pathway. Moreover, our observations indicate that ATF3 messengers are selectively
translated even under conditions where nascent protein synthesis is suppressed. Concomitant to the activation
of the ribosome stall induced response, L.p. also recruits a pool of translationally active ribosomes to its
replicative niche within cells.
This proposal aims to utilize the molecular tools derived from L.p. to understand the mechanisms that link RQC
to the activation of ATF3 in the nucleus. We expect that the results from the proposed set of experiments will
shed light onto fundamental mechanisms that maintain the homeostasis of protein synthesis in cells and
generate new tools to study and dissect the RQC pathway. We have assembled an exceptionally strong team
of experts and compelling preliminary data that highlight our ability to accomplish our goals."
10904662,"Project Abstract
Very few viruses manifest as pathogenic chronic infections in humans and most are cleared acutely. The cell-
intrinsic innate antiviral response provides a first line of defense against invading viruses. Unfortunately, in the
case of chronic viral infections, these initial responses that were ineffective at controlling virus replication can
subsequently cause disease due to chronic inflammation. In most organs, epithelial cells are some of the first
cells to encounter viruses and host defense responses in these cells are paramount to facilitating viral eradication.
Interestingly, epithelial cells predominantly produce type III interferons (IFNs) in response to viral infection
whereas immune cells produce Type II (γ) while Type I (α/β) IFNs are produced by most cells in the body. The
mechanism underlying cell type and organ specific expression of the IFNs are unknown and likely involve
regulation of epigenetic modifications (e.g. SOCS1), gene expression of pattern recognition receptors (e.g. TLR3,
cGAS), associated signaling molecules (e.g. STING) and pertinent transcription factors (e.g. IRF7). In drosophila,
the fat body is the innate immune organ producing antimicrobial peptides in response to pathogens. In humans,
the liver is functionally equivalent to the drosophila fat body while utilizing Type III IFN responses to fight viral
infection and it likely possesses other unique properties with respect to innate immunity when compared to other
organs. We have developed rigorous, novel and exciting in vitro models that utilize primary epithelial cells from
several organs that have intact innate antiviral responses when compared to immortalized or transformed cell
lines. We and others have demonstrated that these cells are of critical importance in the development of disease
since they directly detect components of viral pathogens. We therefore assert that primary cells are the optimal
model to use for studies on innate immunity and we propose a novel approach to rigorously study this based on
the signaling pathways that we have demonstrated to be important for viral clearance and pathogenesis. In
addition, we have developed novel models incorporating primary epithelial cells, iPSC-derived epithelial cells and
3-dimensional chip and microfluidic-based platforms for studies involving multiple cell types. The use of iPSC-
derived cells facilitates the identification of changes in gene expression and epigenetic or post-translational
modifications, which occur during differentiation, that contribute to the unique innate immune system in epithelial
cells. The specific goals of this program are to functionally characterize the innate immune response, to multiple
viral pathogen associated patterns including both DNA and RNA sensing pathways, and to elucidate the
underlying molecular mechanisms through which innate immunity manifests in epithelial cells using sophisticated
models. Furthermore, organ specific and associated developmental changes in the functional expression of
specific signaling pathways will be addressed through studies on epigenetic mechanism underlying tissue specific
antiviral responses. Completion of these ambitious studies would offer in depth characterization of innate
immunity while allowing us to develop new paradigms for its contribution to human disease in multiple organs."
10913969,"My long-term research goal is to develop data-driven mathematical models to understand and control
cell differentiation. My lab’s approach integrates single-cell transcriptomics data in a mathematical model, the
Hopfield model, to describe the signaling dynamics in gene networks and simulate the effect of perturbations on
sets of target genes. Originally developed as a mathematical model of the brain, the Hopfield model allows for a
direct mapping of associative memory patterns into dynamical attractor states in a network, so that the system
can recover a host of memories using partial information. Our rationale for representing phenotypic cell states
as associative memories is that when a cell “decides” to differentiate by expressing a new pattern of genes in a
network, the cell relies on a set of built-in associative memory patterns shaped by evolution. In contrast to many
deep learning and other machine learning methods, representing cellular decision processes using associative
memories provides interpretable information that can integrate pre-existing biological knowledge (e.g., pathway
information) to help elucidate fundamental biological rules. Moreover, the approach goes beyond a descriptive
analysis of single-cell data. It paves the way for in-silico experiments that could identify new drug targets and
generate new hypotheses for pre-clinical and clinical investigation.
 In the next five years, we plan on applying our attractor models to help understand and control two inter-
playing biological processes involved in many diseases: angiogenesis and hematopoiesis. Angiogenesis is the
development of new blood vessels and is required for embryonic development, adult vascular homeostasis, and
tissue repair. Our goal in angiogenesis is to identify organ-specific signals, which will provide new opportunities
to design new therapeutics to stimulate or inhibit angiogenesis in diseased organs (e.g., retinas of patients
suffering from age-related macular degeneration) without affecting healthy organs. In hematopoiesis, we will use
our computational approaches to identify new schemes to generate lymphocytes from induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSC). The bio-manufacturing of iPSC-derived lymphocytes is important for many applications, such as
effective production of T cells for CAR-T therapies and development of cancer vaccines.
 The new targets and target combinations identified by our in-silico experiments could lead to novel
therapeutics for many diseases, including cancer, blindness, arthritis, psoriasis, and many other ischemic,
inflammatory, infectious, and immune disorders. Just as important, this MIRA project will allow us to continue
working with our network of collaborators, keep sharing innovative software tools with the broader biomedical
community, and further contribute to the training of an interdisciplinary health sciences workforce with strong
computational and mathematical skills."
10895278,"Project Abstract
The breadth and depth of deep learning (DL) in solving fundamental biological problems have been
demonstrated. DL-based approaches, such as AlphaFold2 for 3D protein structure prediction, have become
widely accepted by the biology community. The Xu lab has been at the forefront of developing novel DL
algorithms, software, and information systems for diverse biological and medical problems. During the current
project period, the Xu lab has made excellent progress in addressing some of the urgent challenges and needs
for developing DL methods in biological sequence analyses and predictions, as well as other bioinformatics
problems. This R35 project has produced 31 papers covering research topics ranging from protein sequence-
based predictions to drug design, molecular dynamics simulation, and single-cell data analysis. In addition, it
also provided more than ten open-source tools and three major web-based resources to the community.
 The rapid development of new DL techniques and Xu lab’s accumulating expertise in this field bring new
opportunities in shaping DL to molecular biology. The current widely used supervised DL methods in biomedical
research often do not have sufficient data with clean and accurate labels for training and may not have good
generalizability. The emerging self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches that aim to learn informative
representations by exposing relationships between different data perspectives without human annotations are
becoming a new trend. Different data perspectives are broadly called multiview. The multi-view SSL techniques
allow us to generate joint or coordinated representations for single modal and multimodal data with stronger
generalizability, better robustness, and less bias. Though SSL has demonstrated great successes in other fields,
it has only been minimally explored in biology.
 This renewal project will develop a multi-view SSL framework that can handle both single-view and multi-
view data and is capable of single and multiple tasks. It will tackle key challenges and bottlenecks in applying
SSL for biological studies, such as selecting effective views and data augmentations, fusing multimodal data or
data from heterogeneous sources, and integrating biological constraints into SSL models. We will focus on
designing a biology-informed system, enhancing generalizability and robustness, and making the results
biologically interpretable and confidence assessable. The Xu lab will apply and refine the framework to multiple
mainstream biology applications, including anti-CRISPR protein prediction, by exploring various data
augmentation methods for protein sequences, ion and small ligand binding prediction using complementary
views of protein sequences and structures, and single-cell data analyses across different conditions. The
framework will also be tested for broad applications in sequence-based studies and beyond, such as alignment-
free methods for constructing phylogenetic trees and detecting novel protein families, as well as conducting
cross-species single-cell data analysis."
10838545,"The mammalian artificial chromosome (MAC) Core will support the overall Project, which seeks to address the
downstream consequences in cells and animals of DNA damage, the causes and consequences of
chromosome missegregation at cell division, and the mechanisms that drive these processes in tumors. It will
serve as a foundry for MACs that will support each of the individual projects that require chromosome
manipulations and engineering: from site-directed and inducible DNA damage, to reporters for chromosome
segregation errors, to housing the genetically encoded components of a chemical genetics toolbox. MACs can
carry large (i.e. 100-2000 kb) genetic payloads, and exist in cells as molecules that are propagated and
inherited alongside the natural chromosomes. Their autonomous nature is a key advantage, since they deliver
their genetic payloads without insertion or other disruption of the host genome. The Core will employ our recent
innovations in MAC technology that gave rise to a new generation of MAC templates in which we direct the
seeding of centromeric chromatin. This approach permits efficient MAC formation on diverse DNA templates.
The Core will undertake MAC approaches from their design, creation, delivery into cells, characterization,
through to their implementation for experiments proposed in the individual Projects of the program. Specifically,
the Core will develop and use MACs that fall into the following categories: ones that serve as targets for DNA
damage, ones that harbor elaborate genetic payloads that will modulate chromosome segregation with a high
degree of sophistication, and ones that carry fluorescent reporters of chromosome missegregation. The MAC
Core is designed to be flexible to help Project members develop new lines of experimentation that arise from
the findings achieved during the initial steps in the overall program."
10831413,"The vascular access is the lifeline for the hemodialysis patient and the single most important
component of the hemodialysis procedure. The most common etiology of vascular access
dysfunction in hemodialysis patients is failure of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) to mature
successfully for dialysis use (AVF maturation failure). At present, there remains a very high rate of
AVF maturation failure in the United States and there are no effective treatments to enhance AVF
maturation. On a radiologic level, AVF maturation failure is most commonly characterized by a
stenosis at the venous anastomosis, and at a histological level it is characterized by a combination
of aggressive intimal hyperplasia and poor outward remodeling. The poor outcomes following AVF
creation reflect our limited understanding of the mechanisms leading to AVF maturation failure; and
the lack of therapies to treat this clinical problem represent an unmet clinical need. The objective of
this proposal is to investigate a new paradigm, the role of autophagy in AVF maturation. Our
proposal is novel and supported by strong preliminary work from our research team pointing to a
causal role for repressed endothelial cell (EC) autophagy in AVF maturation failure, in response to
a unique setting of disturbed hemodynamics in the AVF and chronic kidney disease (CKD) milieu.
Based on these preliminary studies, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that disturbed flow
and CKD repress endothelial autophagy, leading to AVF maturation failure. Using a combination of
in vitro, in vivo, and, human studies, we will test our central hypothesis with three specific aims: (1)
Identify steps of EC autophagy repression in the setting of disturbed flow and CKD milieu, (2) Define
how repressed EC autophagy contributes to AVF remodeling, and (3) Determine the role of
autophagy in AVF maturation in hemodialysis patients. We believe our proposed research is
significant because: (1) it addressed a very important clinical problem in hemodialysis patients, AVF
maturation failure, where there are presently no effective therapies; and (2) examine a new
paradigm in AVF development, autophagy. Successful completion of these aims will identify
important targets for developing innovative therapies that aim to modify autophagy in order to
enhance AVF maturation."
10831448,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) developed from analysis of large-scale genomic data in epidemiological studies
hold promise as a precision medicine tool that will help identify individuals at higher disease risk. However, a
critical challenge now facing PRS research and clinical translation is that most PRS have been developed
using data from predominantly European-descent individuals, resulting in poorer predictive performance in
non-European populations and reflecting the lack of diversity in genomic and biomedical research more
broadly. NHGRI is establishing a new Polygenic Risk Score Diversity Consortium to address this challenge by
(1) leveraging existing diverse cohorts to improve PRS prediction across diverse, non-European populations
and for a range of conditions and (2) optimizing the integration of large-scale genomic and phenotype datasets
in support of collaborative analysis, reporting, and creation of methods and resources for the broader scientific
community. As Coordinating Center, we will support the Consortium's goals by achieving four main aims: (1)
leading harmonization of genotype and phenotype data across Consortium Study Sites and Affiliate Members,
including variant and sample level quality control, genotype imputation, and use of standard phenotype
ontologies. (2) Organizing cross-Consortium analysis and collaborative methods development, featuring
standardized evaluation of PRS methods to identify consensus approaches, development of a local-ancestry
informed PRS method, and integration of ELSI considerations into analytic best-practices. (3) Facilitating data
sharing within and beyond the Consortium through community resources and repositories such as the NHGRI
Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL), NCBI database of
Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), and the Polygenic Score Catalog. (4) Coordinating program logistics and
outreach including through a Consortium website, in-person meetings, mentorship and training, and regular
engagement with precision medicine partner programs. We propose innovative approaches to achieve these
four main aims, including leveraging emerging cloud-based platforms for harmonization, analysis, and sharing
of large-scale genomic data; investigating scalable data science approaches to phenotype harmonization;
leading a Consortium-wide “bake-off” to establish consensus approaches to PRS generation and evaluation;
and incorporating Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications into analytic best practices. Furthermore, our
application rests on 13 successful years of experience and expertise serving as Coordinating Centers for five
large-scale genetic and biomedical projects. Through scientific and administrative leadership of this
Consortium, we will help realize the public health benefit of developing PRS that predict and help prevent or
mitigate a range of diseases in genetically diverse populations."
10834017,"Project Summary
Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with postnatal onset. Caused by loss-of-function
mutations in the X-linked gene methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), girls with classic RTT develop
normally for the first ~12-18 months of life, reaching the expected milestones, but then lose their acquired
skills over a period of weeks and instead develop stereotypies, ataxia, apraxia, seizures, and a host of other
symptoms. Milder mutations that primarily reduce the amount of MeCP2 protein produced cause milder
symptoms that take longer to manifest. Various mouse models of RTT (male Mecp2 nulls, female
heterozygotes, mice bearing specific disease-causing mutations) faithfully reproduce this natural history
(normal health, regression, and deterioration). Strikingly, deletion of the gene in adulthood reproduces the full
phenotype, whereas expression of Mecp2 in adult null mice rescues it, demonstrating that MeCP2 has some as-
yet-unspecified function that is critical for neuronal maintenance. Although gene therapy would seem the best
hope, the mosaic nature of MeCP2 in females (~50% of neurons will have wild-type MeCP2) presents a difficult
challenge for this approach, as too much MeCP2 also causes disease (MECP2 duplication syndrome [MDS],
which is every bit as devastating). Therefore, in our search for viable therapeutic options, we are guided by two
principles: the period of early normal development provides a window of opportunity to intervene and delay
onset, and the lag between loss of MeCp2 and appearance of symptoms (or reversal of symptoms, in the context
of rescuing MDS) means there is a cascade of molecular events that, if we could but map them, should allow us
to identify key genes or pathways that could serve as therapeutic targets and biomarkers of treatment response.
Having previously found that forniceal deep brain stimulation improves learning and memory in RTT mice, we
hypothesized that motor training during the presymptomatic period might also stimulate the neural circuits
and delay symptom onset. Indeed, this proved to be the case. We now seek to trace the cascade of molecular
and cellular changes that occur after MeCP2 depletion but before the onset of symptoms to define initiators of
RTT pathogenesis and biomarkers of response as we stimulate the brain through intensive training or raise
MeCP2 levels in the context of hypomorphic mutations. In our first aim, we will identify the transcriptional
changes that take place in task-specific neurons that respond to intensive training with improved function,
electrophysiology, and morphology. In aim 2, we will trace the cascade of molecular, epigenetic, and cellular
changes that follow for several weeks after acute MeCP2 depletion, and that eventually lead to neurological
dysfunction. In aim 3, we will upregulate MeCP2 levels in two distinct RTT mouse models, each carrying
mutations that reduce MeCP2 levels, to determine the extent of improvement."
10817096,"Project summary:
The long-term goal of my research program is to understand, in detail, the mechanisms of
mammalian mRNA 3’ processing and its regulation. mRNA 3’-end formation, typically
involving an endonucleolytic cleavage followed by polyadenylation, is an essential step of
eukaryotic gene expression and it significantly impacts many aspects of RNA metabolism,
including mRNA stability, subcellular localization and translation. In addition, the majority
of eukaryotic genes produce multiple mRNA isoforms with distinct 3’ ends through
alternative polyadenylation (APA). Recent studies have revealed that APA is highly
regulated in development and plays an important role in post-transcriptional gene
regulation. Aberrant APA patterns have been associated with a wide range of diseases,
from cancer to neurological disorders. Key outstanding questions in the mRNA 3’
processing field include: 1) what is the structure-function relationship of the mRNA 3’
processing complex; 2) how is mRNA 3’ processing regulated by cell signaling; 3) how is
APA regulated by RNA-binding proteins? We will address these questions by using
biochemical, structural, and genomic analyses. The results of these studies will not only
provide novel insights into this key step in eukaryotic gene expression, but also pave the
way for developing novel therapy for many diseases."
10848266,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent advances of experimental techniques allow quantitative and systems‐wide measurements of non‐
genetic heterogeneity of mammalian cells, which serves as a crucial factor for stem cell dynamics and
differentiation potentials, as well as drug resistance of cancer cells. However, it remains challenging to
understand many puzzling observations regarding this type of heterogeneity in terms of underlying gene
regulatory networks. For example, progenitor cells restore their heterogeneity on timescales of days from
subpopulation with extreme gene expression patterns, and these cells switch from plasticity‐enabling
dynamics to robust commitment and pattern formation during differentiation; epithelial cells can be
distributed in a stable continuum in the epithelial‐mesenchymal spectrum upon receiving signals in
tumors. Existing theories provide very limited insights into these important dynamics and patterns. We
propose to combine mathematical modeling, new methods of analyzing gene regulatory networks and
gene expression data, and experiments in a motor neuron differentiation system, and systems involving
epithelial‐mesenchymal transition to study transcriptional and post‐transcriptional mechanisms
underlying non‐genetic heterogeneity in mammalian cells.
We propose to test a novel theoretical framework of a diverging oscillator for controlling progenitor cell
dynamics with both computational methods and experimental systems. We will rigorously formulate and
test a new hypothesis of an oscillator‐to‐switch transition for motor neuron differentiation in the
developing spinal cord. Stemming from our recent results on surprising post‐transcriptional mechanisms
for multistability and oscillation, we will use novel algebraic approaches to establish the relationship
between the number of microRNA bindings sites and biologically plausible cell states. We will test the
roles of microRNA binding in epithelial cell plasticity experimentally. We will examine the roles of
epithelial plasticity and microRNAs in dynamics of lung cancer cells. The success of the proposed study
will provide a new theoretical basis and new methods for interpreting and understanding dynamical gene
expression data on non‐genetic heterogeneity in mammalian cells. The theories and methods can used as
a foundation to develop therapeutics for diseases related to development, tissue degeneration and cancer."
10827942,"Inward-rectifier K+ (Kir) channels and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins that are
regulated by cholesterol and anionic lipids found in their native membranes. We will use solid-state NMR
(SSNMR) to study proteins with functional lipids in bilayer environments ranging from proteoliposomes to
biological membranes. These measurements will compliment functional assays, fluorescence techniques, and
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations under identical conditions. Kir channels are involved in long-QT syndrome,
hypoglycemia, Bartter’s syndrome, epilepsy, substance abuse, and periodic paralysis. Kir Channels are ligand
gated, but details of the structure and dynamics of gated channels are largely unknown. The Kir2 channel family
is gated by the anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) but inactivated by cholesterol which
competes with PIP2 to access the protein. G protein-activated Kir channels (GIRK, Kir3) are gated by the coaction
of PIP2 and Gbγ protein heterodimers. In the Kir3 family, cholesterol increases rather than suppresses activity.
Here we will explore the differing roles of functional lipids and quantify the structure and dynamics of the observed
active and inactivated states. We will continue our studies of the Kir channel, KirBac1.1. We assigned 90% of
the 15N and 13C chemical shifts in this protein (over 1600 unique heavy atoms) and used these assignments to
identify allostery, the activation mechanism, the inactivated structure bound to a cholesterol dimer, refined the
structure of the closed state, and solved the structure of the open state of the channel. Now we will measure the
channel dynamics and identify the multiple gated states of the channel reflected in our data. We will study
structural changes in the channel under voltage and identify discrete channel states and lipid contacts using
freeze-trapped Dynamic Nuclear Polarization. In tandem, we will also study the Kir3.1-KirBac1.3 channel
chimera. Preliminary data identifies PIP2 binding residues and membrane-water interfacial residues key for
channel function. The eventual goal will be the mammalian Kir3.2 (GIRK2) channel and its full complement of
functional activators. In a second project we will study the CC motif chemokine receptor CCR3 with the CCL11
chemokine in lipid bilayers. No drug trial targeting CCR3 has succeeded, which is unfortunate as it is involved in
cancer metastasis, HIV entry, and the COVID19 cytokine storm. To date, we identified both CCL11 docking, and
signal transduction are dose dependent upon bilayer cholesterol. Preliminary SSNMR studies found cholesterol
conformationally selects for optimal ligand binding configurations of the receptor. We plan to fully assign the 15N
and 13C chemical shifts of CCR3 in cholesterol and anionic lipid enriched membranes. The structures of this
protein with CCLL11 in different functional states will be solved, and regional dynamics measured following a
similar workflow established for KirBac1.1. NMR will also be used to solve the structures of CCL11 in solution
and in complex with CCR3. We will pursue cholesterol oligomerization, CCR3 dimerization, and the relationship
between these events. Throughout we will examine lipid oligomerization, dynamics, and protein affinity."

Flaviviruses are important human pathogens including viruses such as West Nile, dengue, and Zika. No
specific treatments or vaccines are available against these infections, and no biomarkers exist that allow
predicting their outcome, characterized by important clinical variability. Understanding innate antiviral immune
responses against flaviviruses, could lead to the identification of disease susceptibility biomarkers and
therapeutic targets. We recently demonstrated that the type I interferon-stimulated protein Schlafen 11
(SLFN11) is a novel and potent flavivirus restriction factor. In this application we aim to define, at the molecular
level, several aspects of the mechanism of action of SLFN11 and determine the anti-flavivirus activity of other
members of the SLFN family, as well as the in vivo relevance of this defense system. Therefore, this
investigation is highly relevant and will significantly advance our understanding of the antiviral mechanism of
action of SLFN proteins, which is currently unknown."
10847386,"One of the manifestations of Chlamydial pathogenesis in women is tubal factor infertility (TFI). The molecular
mechanism underpinning the pathologic changes that cause TFI is poorly understood. We have reported that
the time of day of infection influences chlamydia infectivity and pathogenesis. Results from our lab show that
when circadian rhythms were disrupted using a Jet lag model, chlamydia-infected mice had increased infectivity
and pathology. Our work has demonstrated that miRNAs and genes associated with circadian rhythms are
differentially expressed during chlamydia infection. Our premise in this study hypothesizes that circadian rhythms
have a role in controlling/regulating chlamydial pathogenesis, leading to infertility. The central goal of this project
is to understand the role of circadian rhythms on chlamydial pathogenesis through these aims (1) Investigate the
association of host circadian rhythms with chlamydial pathogenesis. We hypothesize that circadian control of
chlamydial pathogenesis is essential in determining disease outcomes. We will determine the role and
involvement of clock genes Bmal1, Per2, and Cry1 on chlamydial pathogenesis using commercially available
Bmal1KO, Per2KO, and Cry1KO mice. (2) Define the circadian control of pathways involved in chlamydial
pathogenesis. We hypothesize that the intrinsic disposition of the genital tract to pathogeneic changes will
depend on what genes/proteins are activated or inhibited by clock genes. We will also determine genes that are
undergoing cycling at different states of chlamydia infection. We will test this hypothesis using C. muridarum
infected WT, Bmal1KO, Per2KO, and Cry1KO mice. This study gives us a basis to predict the level of severity
of pathogenesis after chlamydia infection and identify new underlying mechanisms involved in chlamydia
pathogenesis. By accomplishing the outcomes of the specific aims, we predict that the knowledge gained will
positively impact women's reproductive health."
10809057,"Glioblastoma (GBM) and tumor-related epilepsy (TRE) are intimately linked and devastating neurological
disorders lacking effective therapies despite decades of promising pre-clinical and clinical research. TRE is
reported in 40-60% of all GBM patients, often as the presenting symptom, and therefore new treatments would
be highly significant, not only for slowing tumor progression but also improving seizure-free quality of life. In
recent years, multiple lines of evidence have shown that malignant GBM cells can utilize numerous pathways
of interaction to drive peritumoral neural tissue into hyperactive states, thereby facilitating their own
proliferation and setting in motion a vicious feedback loop resulting in runaway disease progression in most
patients. Specifically, excess glutamate seems to be involved in many cellular neuron-glia interactions
including, increased synaptogenesis and hyperexcitability, and we now have evidence for specific genes
expressed in our genetic murine tumor model that drive malignant processes. However, we do not know how
these processes unfold over time in a native, immunocompetent mammalian tumor model, and how potential
therapeutic windows could be exploited to intervene and slow tumor growth. I propose to dissect the
mechanisms of tumor-induced glutamate dysregulation and, vice versa, tumor regulation by neural activity
using, for the first time, chronic in vivo cellular and macroscale imaging in a CRISPR/Cas9 genetic model of
GBM. We recently published the first widefield-calcium imaging study of this genetic GBM model and
characterized spatial and temporal profiles of seizures and spreading depolarization waves. We will use these
techniques, as well as cellular resolution 2-photon imaging, simultaneous EEG and behavioral monitoring to
address the following questions:1) How does GBM cause the degradation of glutamate homeostasis and
calcium activity over time? Using chronic widefield imaging of genetically expressed glutamate and calcium
activity indicators, we will follow neural activity and malignant glia invasion in vivo to determine spatial and
temporal dynamics of hyperexcitability and GBM growth. 2) How do these dysregulation dynamics change
when we perturb the genetic tumor driver composition? We will add genes encoding glypicans 3 and 6,
recently identified as synaptogenic proteins secreted by astrocytes, to our CRISPR/Cas9 construct. 3) How do
different methods of controlling neural hyperexcitability affect GBM growth? We will determine which targets
are more amenable to effective intervention than others by studying the effect of NMDA- and AMPA receptor
blockers over time in vivo. In addition, we will assess the contribution of non-synaptic glutamate release using
mice with a genetic deletion of the xCT cystine-glutamate astrocytic antiporter. Finally, we will directly silence
local peritumoral neurons using inhibitory DREADD constructs and measure subsequent GBM deceleration."

Given the over-abundance of food in modern society, it is easy to lose sight of the importance of feeding to
animals in nature. For most animals, food is extremely scarce and being wise to opportunities to eat is
essential for survival. As such, the circadian system has evolved to receive a number of different stimuli—
i.e., light, temperature, food, and even fear—to keep biological processes coordinated and allow for
adaptation to ever changing conditions. The ability to tell time relative to feeding has a long history of
research, going back more than one hundred years hundred years with behavioral observations of
honeybees and rats. However, the neural circuitry behind adaptation of behavior to timed feeding has
continually escaped our grasp. In this project, I will utilize conditional genetics, viral restorations, and
chemogenetic tools to identify the dopamine population (both anatomically and genetically) that is required
for the behavioral expression of food anticipatory activity in lab mice. From here, we will build out a more
comprehensive characterization of how a select population of dopamine neurons projecting to the striatum
can inform the time keeping systems of the brain that food is available."

Brooklyn College’s U-RISE proposal aims to increase the diversity of our science workforce by providing
individuals from groups historically under-represented in STEM with the preparation, confidence and self-
efficacy to pursue graduate studies and succeed in obtaining doctoral degrees and launching a STEM career.
About half of Brooklyn College’s students are eligible for U-RISE based on race/ethnicity or low-income criteria.
We strive for (1) 98% of U-RISE trainees to obtain baccalaureate degrees (adjusted from 100% because of the
deep impact of the pandemic in New York City); (2) 60% of U-RISE graduates to matriculate into doctoral
programs. Out of these, our objective is that at least 90% will complete their doctoral degrees. Overall, we aim
for over 50% of our U-RISE trainees to eventually attain doctoral degrees.
We have recruited 29 faculty members, including eight from under-represented groups themselves, to serve as
U-RISE mentors. Participating mentors are profoundly committed to undergraduate research. Students will be
recruited into the program in their sophomore or junior years. Approximately 80 trainees will be served over the
five-year tenure of this program.
Meaningful faculty-mentored research experiences are at the core of our program. Trainees will participate in
research both at Brooklyn College during the academic year and at R1 institutions during the summer.
Moreover, trainees will be advised and mentored by program staff as well as faculty. Further, they will receive
instruction in research design, statistics, responsible conduct of research, rigor and reproducibility, scientific
communication, study skills, and mentee responsibilities among other topics. We will also include activities to
promote holistic student wellbeing (mental health and social support, family involvement) as well as activities
for professional development. This U-RISE program will synergize with other undergraduate research
programs in STEM on campus via the Center for Achievement in Science Education.
The Brooklyn College U-RISE program will improve upon a tradition of excellence and a wide-array of activities
set by a long-standing MARC program by: (1) recruiting students at earlier stages of training, (2) training
faculty in mentorship practices and (3) supporting important skills such as biomedical computing and scientific
communication, among others."
10810804,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Cells choose transcriptional programs, in part, by passing information from molecular sensors to
signaling cascades that modulate the activity of DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs). Changes in
TF activity lead to changes in the transcription rates of specific genes, which are often the first steps in
responding to new information. The molecular machinery responsible for this can be thought of as the
cell's control circuits.
 My research program focuses on developing computational and molecular methods that make it
possible to map out a cell's control circuits, to watch them as they respond to new information, and
ultimately to rewire them in ways that contribute to human health and well-being. Saccharomyces cere-
visiae (yeast) is the ideal organism for developing these methods because of its relatively simple ge-
nome, extensive collections of strains engineered for experimental systems biology, and
comprehensive datasets for testing and optimizing new methods. The research proposed here focuses
exclusively on yeast, but our methods will be immediately applicable to fungal pathogens and ultimately
adaptable for model organisms and humans.
 The first objective of our plan is to optimize methods for determining which genes are regulated by
each TF. We will use these methods to produce a map of the TF-target network that goes significantly
beyond what is known today, both in accuracy and completeness. Like the map of metabolic reactions,
this will be a valuable resource for addressing many scientific questions.
 Our second objective is to develope methods for inferring the activity levels of all TFs in any sample
of cells by analyzing their transcriptomes. One product of this work will be easy-to-use software that
will enable other scientists to identify changes in TF activity in any set of yeast transcriptional profiles.
 Our third objective is to develop methods for identifying proteins that regulate the activities of each
TF. This will make it possible to explain the changes in TF activity we observe when stimuli, such as
drugs or nutrients, are provided to cells, and to design experiments that test those explanations.
 Achieving these objectives will make it possible to approach our ultimate goal – to develop a quan-
titative model that can predict the transcriptional response to genetic and environmental perturbations.
As a concrete benchmark for success, this model should accurately predict the effect on the entire
yeast transcriptome when combinations of TFs are simultaneously perturbed (deleted or overex-
pressed) under growth conditions for which we have no perturbation data. We can achieve this ambi-
tious, long term goal only with stable MIRA funding."
10819227,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Every 3 minutes in the United States, a person dies after suffering a severe acute vascular brain injury (SABI):
an ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage or cardiac arrest. SABI accounts for more than one in 10 deaths
globally and is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. Though advances in acute management of SABI
have improved the chance of good outcome for some, this condition continues to have a tremendous impact for
many due to high mortality, long-term disability, high symptom burden, complex care transitions, and changing
goals of care over time. Yet, as most studies focus on measures of functional outcome or mortality, evidence-
based information about more global multidimensional symptoms over time, and especially in the last weeks of
life, is lacking. In addition, family members of patients with SABI are at risk for long-term psychological distress
and reduced quality of life due to the burdens of surrogate decision-making, caregiving, and complicated grief.
In contrast to many other serious illnesses, such as cancer or dementia, where death often follows a progressive
decline in function, palliative care provision and serious illness conversations after SABI are uniquely challenging
due to the suddenness of onset and substantial prognostic uncertainty that includes the potential for recovery.
Palliative care specialists are rarely involved in the care of these patients. Preliminary studies have identified
substantial missed opportunities to identify and address symptoms such as pain or psychological distress, or to
prepare families for the high likelihood of death. In addition, hospital survivors are rarely discharged home and
face fragmented care across nursing facilities, rehabilitation centers and hospitals. Currently, there is a critical
gap in our understanding of the symptom burden among SABI patients and their families, as well as our
understanding of how palliative care is integrated into SABI management. To better understand how to re-
imagine care delivery models, we will conduct a multi-center prospective, longitudinal, mixed-methods cohort
study of 540 patients with SABI and their families to examine key modifiable healthcare system determinants
that may be targets for future intervention. The aims of this proposal are: 1) To define the trajectory and
determinants of multidimensional symptom burden and quality of dying among patients with SABI to facilitate
intervention development; 2) To identify key healthcare system factors and patient-related determinants
associated with psychological distress among family members of patients with SABI; and 3) To better understand
patient and family caregiver needs, identify gaps in care, and explore their perspectives on potential nursing and
palliative care interventions to address unmet needs across the SABI continuum with in-depth interviews. Results
of this work will allow us to target deficiencies in our health system through the design of specific, tailorable
nursing and palliative care interventions. The depth and breadth of our findings will lead to contextually
appropriate interventions for this population that will reduce suffering and improve quality of life and the quality
of end-of-life care for all individuals affected by severe acute brain injury."

The goal of the proposed research is to study the effects of abnormal early visual experience on the
development of inferotemporal cortex in infant macaques. In adult humans and monkeys discrete regions of
the temporal lobe are specialized for processing particular object categories, such as faces, text, bodies, or
places. These domains underlie complex object recognition. Visual experience of these categories is both
necessary and sufficient to produce domains, and the goal is to explore how specific abnormal early visual
experience changes neuronal selectivity."

Ureteroscopy (URS) via laser lithotripsy (LL) is the treatment of choice for urinary stone disease (USD), which is
the second most costly urologic condition in the US with an annual healthcare expenditure over $2 billion. The
recent clinical introduction of high power/high frequency Holmium (Ho): YAG lasers and Thulium Fiber Laser
(TFL) have fundamentally altered the mode of LL operation. Instead of the conventional fragmenting mode with
basket extraction of sizable fragments, contemporary LL is often performed using dusting and pop-dusting
modes that pulverize stone to dust in situ without the need for fragment extraction. The challenges in dusting
and pop-dusting at present, however, are three-fold: 1) the mechanism of action is not fully understood, 2) the
optimal treatment condition varies significantly with stone compositions, and 3) rapid temperature rise is
produced during high power pop-dusting. Consequently, there is an unmet need to develop new and clinically
deployable technologies capable of improving the treatment efficiency regardless of stone compositions,
shortening the procedure time, while concomitantly lessening the risk of renal tissue injury. The overarching goal
of this Duke University FORWARD Urology Center (P20) application is to foster and support the career
development of Dr. Po-Chun Hsu, PhD who is a promising early-stage investigator with expertise in
nanotechnology, yet new to the field of USD and benign urology. The Center's Research Project has three
Specific Aims focusing on (1) Developing biologically safe nanoparticles with absorption peak optimized for
Ho:YAG laser (=2.1 m) and TFL (=1.94 m); (2) Investigating the effects of nanoparticle-enhanced pop-
dusting in a hydrogel-based kidney model, and (3) Exploring the effects of nanoparticle-enhanced pop-dusting
in a porcine model. The Center's Administrative Core has two Specific Aims: (1) Facilitating productive
collaborations among the Research Project Team and with the broader CAIRIBU research community, and (2)
Fostering and supporting the career development plan for Dr. Hsu. Furthermore, we will leverage the knowledge,
resources, and experience accumulated from a recently completed P20 exploratory center on LL at Duke (PI:
Zhong, PhD), together with the support of the NIDDK CAIRIBU Interactions Core (PI: Penniston, PhD) and the
Columbia U54 Center (co-PI: Barasch, PhD/MD) on assessment of renal injury in a porcine model. Synergies,
preliminary data, and knowledge created by this P20 FORWARD program will support future R01 applications
on nanotechnology-enhanced LL and the broad range of USD research through the NIDDK CAIRIBU program."

This project contains a highly collaborative investigative team with interdisciplinary expertise with significant
potential impact for HIV/AIDS prevention. The proposal includes pharmacologic, virologic, animal and product
development studies designed to halt disease transmission through novel long-acting (LA) antiretrovirals.
These are named LA slow effective release antiretroviral therapies (LASER ART) designed to facilitate HIV-1
prevention by intense bench to the clinic translational studies. Innovative interdisciplinary approaches contain
a detailed research plan, extensive preliminary and broadly published supportive data. Creativity and
innovativeness are offered placed at higher risk than a conventional research project. The work builds on the
development of parenteral nanoformulations of chemically modified antiretroviral drugs designed to improve
adherence. The drugs are currently offered once/day in pill form but will be converted to up to once a year
administration. Support from expert pharmacologists and pharmaceutical scientists with University researchers
are operative. The drugs include dolutegravir (DTG), emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir (TFV) created to extend
their apparent drug half-life, efficacy and abilities to target viral reservoirs. They are, in measure, DTG and FTC
and TFV prodrug + nucleotide (ProTides) designated “N” for nanoformulation, “M” for esterification and “P” for
ProTides. The created NPFTC and NPTFV and NM2DTG demonstrate sustained plasma and tissue drug
concentrations of > 90% inhibitory concentration from months to a year. Based on encouraging results, we
seek funds to facilitate large scale development that would facilitate future human studies. The final
formulations would be characterized by sustained prodrug hydrolysis with reduced injection volumes. The
pathway forward follows established partnership with the Clinton Health Access Initiative and oversight by ViiV
Healthcare and Gilead Sciences. The overarching goal is safety, reproducibility and “scale-up” that follows US
Food and Drug Administration-approved current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). The specific aims are
each supported by extensive published data sets forged through the multidisciplinary research. Creation and
characterization focus on prodrug formulations, toxicology, and pharmacokinetics profiles follow a safe
developmental action plan. The work is facilitated by a fully operational cGMP facility and rhesus macaque
validations. The lead formulation will be developed with our CHAI partners. We posit that the creation of
LASER ART DTG or FTC and TFV will have a profound impact on HIV prevention."
10817258,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A substantial proportion of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) also meet criteria for posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD). The co-occurrence of AUD/PTSD is characterized by more severe symptomatology, greater
functional impairment, increased suicide risk, and poorer treatment outcomes as compared to either disorder
alone. Trauma-focused, cognitive-behavioral interventions delivered alongside interventions for substance use
disorders are most effective in reducing PTSD severity and substance use. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)
for PTSD and Relapse Prevention (RP) for AUD are two of the most widely used and efficacious behavioral
treatments for these conditions. The investigators successfully developed and pilot tested a therapy manual that
combines CPT with RP. The preliminary data demonstrate safety, feasibility, high rates of retention (80.0%) and
patient satisfaction. Moreover, our data from a recent national survey of frontline mental health providers (N =
76) indicate that CPT is the most commonly used trauma-focused treatment for PTSD and providers are highly
interested in an integrative CPT-RP intervention, conferring strong potential for uptake in real-world practice
settings. In fact, due to the lack of an available, empirically developed, manualized CPT-RP treatment, 84.0% of
frontline providers report attempting on their own to create such a treatment to use with their patients. This may
result in highly variable and suboptimal implementation and outcomes. In response to provider input and positive
preliminary data, the proposed study directly addresses this critical need by evaluating a new integrative CPT-
RP treatment for individuals with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. At present, only one trauma-focused, integrative
intervention is available for AUD/PTSD and it uses Prolonged Exposure (PE) to reduce PTSD symptoms. In
comparison to PE, CPT is more widely used, often preferred by clinicians, equally as effective in reducing PTSD
symptoms, and associated with lower dropout rates. Thus, the new CPT-RP intervention could have wider reach
and greater acceptability than exposure-based treatments. Treatment choice is related to improved treatment
outcomes, and therefore, there is an immediate need to add to the portfolio of evidence-based, trauma-focused,
integrative treatments for AUD/PTSD. The primary objective of this Stage II study is to examine the efficacy of
CPT-RP, as compared to RP alone, in reducing (1) alcohol use frequency and quantity and (2) PTSD symptom
severity among individuals with current AUD/PTSD. To accomplish this, we will employ a manualized
intervention, randomized study design, and standardized repeated dependent measures of clinical outcomes at
multiple time points. Putative mechanisms of behavior change will be evaluated via daily monitoring. The
proposed study aligns closely with the mission of NIAAA in that it aims to produce maximally efficacious
behavioral interventions for AUD and comorbid psychiatric disorders such as PTSD. The findings from this study
will provide new information to advance the science of AUD/PTSD comorbidity and innovate clinical practice."

The graduate program in vision science at The Ohio State University has a long track record of training
optometrists for careers as clinician scientists. The program has yielded many NIH funded investigators,
clinical trialists, and significant contributors to the field of vision science. More recent partnerships with
ophthalmology and neuroscience have only further strengthened the program which boasts a breadth of
research training opportunities from basic science, animal models, patient-based research, and multi-center
clinical trials. In recent years, the program has attracted a large number of female applicants, helping to
address the gender disparities that commonly exist in scientific training. This proposal seeks funding to provide
support for post-doctoral trainees who have completed an optometric doctorate and are now seeking a PhD.
The proposal seeks to support one trainee in the initial year and add an additional trainee in each of years 2 &
3 to reach a total number of three trainees for the third and subsequent years. The faculty appointed to this
award have strong records of NEI funding and provide a rich variety of research topics to include corneal
biomechanics and wound healing, retinal regeneration, refractive error, pediatric and binocular vision,
population vision health, and low vision rehabilitation. Trainees will gain education in the fundamentals of vision
science and the ethical conduct of research, complete mock grant proposals, write a review paper, run
research projects under the mentorship of their advisors, participate in public presentation of their research at
least annually, and be mentored in the publication of their scientific work. The Ohio State University is
committed to the advancement of individuals from diverse or disadvantaged backgrounds and will seek to
prioritize the appointment of these applicants to the award. Engaging optometrists in rigorous scientific training
is critical to maintain the workforce needed to address the many vision disorders impacting both the aging
population and our youth. Ohio State University is one of the leading institutions in yielding clinician scientists
from the pool of US trained optometrists. The support of this award will further enhance the ability of the vision
science graduate program to produce excellent researchers by providing stipends to maximize the dedicated
research time of the trainees and focus their efforts solely on training."

The objective of our University of Washington's (UW) Pediatric Infectious Diseases (PID) Training Program (TP)
is to train future research leaders in infectious diseases of children. Our TP (1) recruits experienced and
committed pediatricians and researchers; (2) trains them in molecular, genomic, proteomic, bioinformatic, and
epidemiologic methods, and (3) mentors them to develop and lead an independent research program. We
request the renewal of T32 support to train four trainees in research annually. Initially, each pediatrician fellow
engages in 12 months of clinical training (for PID certification), supported by Seattle Children's Hospital (SCH).
Subsequently, the T32 will support each for 2 years of mentored research by Training Faculty (TF) who are
leaders in their areas of research and excel at mentorship. Trainees and TF are encouraged to tackle projects
that contribute novel and critical insights into understanding and treating pediatric infectious diseases and
generate preliminary data for a K, R, or other awards. In addition, trainees receive didactic and hands-on
education in the federal regulations governing research with humans and/or animals, grant and manuscript
preparation, and strategies to succeed in academia. Our curriculum includes a structured timeline to transition
to “K”-series NIH awards, and if needed, our department extends support to assist trainees in this transition. Our
NIH T32-supported UW-PID-FP has trained 102 fellows since 1981, with a consistent record of developing
research leaders in Maternal-Child Health (Figure 1, Program Plan). During the past 15 years, 30 fellows have
successfully completed our TP, 1 transferred to a different TP, 1 withdrew from training, 7 are current fellows,
and 1 incoming fellow will begin in July 2022. As of May 2022, of the 30 TP graduates from the past 15 years,
15 (50%) have been awarded Ks. Of the graduates completing our TP more than 5 years ago (and therefore at
the stage one would progress to NIH R-level funding), 6/20 (30%) have received Rs. Biomedical research
continues to be a primary focus of 19/30 (63%) graduates from the last 15 years: 16 lead academic labs (PIs of
R, K or foundation grants), 1 is a lead researcher within a government institutions with intramural funds, 1 is an
industry researcher, and 1 is a university biology professor teaching undergraduates and performing research.
The remaining 11/34 (37%) include: 8 clinician educators at academic hospitals where they participate in
research, and 3 clinical infectious disease specialists. Of our 7 current fellows and 1 new fellow entering in July
2022, 5 have submitted ≥1 applications for NIH, government, and/or foundation grants; 2 received awards, 1
awaits notice of award, and 2 have pending applications. Among our current fellows and recent graduates (N=38)
from the past 15 years, 6 (16%) are under-represented-minorities (URM) or from NIH-defined disadvantaged
groups in health sciences. In 2022, two fellows will complete fellowship and both will continue as faculty at UW."
10833138,"Many enzymes catalyzing ubiquitin-like (Ubl) modifications have been identified as targets for
the therapeutic development of life-threatening human diseases that lack a cure. However, Ubl
modifications are poorly addressed by FDA approved drugs, highlighting the immense potential
to exploit this type of post-translational modification to address unmet medical needs.
Conjugation of Ubls to target proteins begins by activation of the C-terminus of a Ubl, a step
catalyzed by enzymes generally known as activating enzyme or E1. Several E1 enzymes,
including the SUMO-activating enzyme (SAE), have been validated as therapeutic targets by
animal models and by early phase clinical studies. Our recent discovery of a conserved
cryptic site on the SAE provides a paradigm-shifting allosteric approach to inhibit Ubl
activating enzymes. In the next funding period, we will further elucidate the mechanism of
the structure-activity relationship. Additionally, we will validate that the allosteric inhibition
approach we discovered reduces cancer drug resistance for targeting Ubl activating
enzymes. Furthermore, we will define the molecular mechanism of how SUMOylation
regulates type I IFN expression and validate that SAE inhibition is an effective approach to
induce anti-tumor immunity for immune cold colorectal cancers. The proposed studies build
on our scientific progress in the previous funding cycle and our more than 20-year
experience in studying SUMOylation. The proposed studies are expected to result in long-
lasting impacts that will spur innovation in targeting Ubl for therapeutic development and
result in new immune therapeutic strategies for immune cold tumors that do not respond to
current immune therapies and are high unmet needs, such as colorectal cancers."

Research in the Cancer Genes and Pathways (CGP) program focuses on defining essential molecular and
biological mechanisms underlying tumor pathogenesis and successful therapy. The primary goal of this basic
science program is to discover, characterize, and validate new tumor alterations (genetic, molecular and
cellular pathways) to fuel translational cancer research that will lead to improved cancer patient outcomes. This
is accomplished through three overlapping research aims centered on the study of 1) structural and functional
genetic and nuclear alterations that promote tumorigenesis, 2) intrinsic cellular processes and pathways that
drive malignant transformation and tumor progression, and 3) tumor extrinsic factors, such as immune cells
and environmental carcinogens, that contribute to cancer development and suppression. Key scientific
achievements over the prior funding period include defining the role of RAD52 protein in damaged DNA repair
and genome stability, identifying metastatic gene signatures and druggable pathways driving neuroendocrine
tumor (NET) pathogenesis, and deciphering fundamental mechanisms by which external mechanical forces
influence tumor cell metabolism. CGP membership includes 42 full and nine associate members spanning
seventeen departments across four colleges. Annual direct cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding in the last
budget year was $6.7 million with $1.2 million from the NCI. CGP members are highly collaborative, having
authored or co-authored 384 cancer-related peer-reviewed publications in the past four years, with 22% (n=
85) intraprogrammatic, 30% (n= 117) interprogrammatic, and 54% (n= 206) inter-institutional publications. 57
manuscripts appeared in high impact journals (Impact Factor >10). Productive intra/interprogrammatic and
multi-institutional groups are leading investigations that reflect the breadth of CGP research, including
advances in mechanisms of DNA repair and genome instability, genetic and molecular events underlying blood
cell transformation, animal tumor model development, druggable pathways in sarcoma, novel targets and
therapies for NETs, G-protein signaling in breast cancer stemness and metastasis, immune cell activation and
the tumor microenvironment, carcinogenic effects of Iowa environmental toxins, and drug resistance in
melanoma. In the context of the CCSG, CGP is the basic science foundation that is guided by and drives
translational oncology through its partnership with other Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center (HCCC)
programs. This is exemplified by CGP member direction of tumor procurement, CGP provision of integral
genomic, immunological, and bioinformatics support for clinical studies involving colleagues in all four HCCC
programs, the outstanding number of interprogrammatic publications, and key leadership roles of CGP
members on a U01 and two NCI SPORE grants."

During the past two decades a significant body of evidence has shown that metabolic oxidation/reduction
reactions represent a significant underlying mechanism contributing to promotion and progression of
malignancy, as well as a therapeutic target for selectively sensitizing cancer cells to therapeutic interventions
and protecting normal tissues from conventional cytotoxic therapies. Evolving in parallel has been the
recognition that advanced medical imaging techniques, measuring metabolic changes in cancer versus normal
tissues before and during therapy show great promise in allowing non-invasive quantitation and monitoring of
fundamental differences in cancer cell metabolism to improve cancer therapy. The overarching hypothesis in
the Free Radical Metabolism and Imaging (FRMI) program is that cancer cells exist in a chronic state of
metabolic oxidative stress that represents a significant underlying mechanism contributing to promotion and
progression of malignancy as well as a therapeutic target for sensitizing tumor cells to therapy as well as
protecting against normal tissue injury. Furthermore, functional imaging techniques measuring metabolic
changes in tumors versus normal tissues have shown great promise as predictors and biomarkers that can be
used to improve cancer therapy. The diverse membership of this unique program includes 33 full members and
five associate members representing two colleges and nine departments. These investigators work together to
take full advantage of the convergence of the science in these two related disciplines for developing a
mechanism based biochemical rationale for new image-guided cancer therapies and diagnostic/prognostic
tools. FRMI members are highly collaborative. During the last period of support, 83% of a total of 235 cancer
relevant publications were collaborative including 75 (32%) intraprogrammatic, 83 (35%) interprogrammatic
and 127 (54%) interinstitutional publications including 17 in high impact (Impact Factor >10) journals. Program
member cancer research was supported by $3.7 million of direct peer-reviewed funding including $2.1 million
of NCI funding in the last year of CCSG support. Productive intra/interprogrammatic and interinstitutional
groups are leading advances in the development of pharmacological ascorbate as an adjuvant to cancer
therapy supported by a new NCI P01, superoxide dismutase mimetics for protection of normal tissues
toxicities, and peptide-targeted, radionuclide-based theragnostic treatments."

area needs and understand health disparities; (2) to address these needs through strategic research across
the HCCC; and (3) to engage the community and disseminate and evaluate evidence-based interventions. At
the center of these aims is the HCCC Community Advisory Board whose advice guides priority-setting,
inclusion of under-represented populations in research, and assuring cancer control activities are aligned with
priorities. HCCC COE activities include providing data and geospatial visualizations to monitor goals and
support community health needs assessment; communicating with researchers about community-driven
priorities; pilot grants and technical assistance for researchers from any program for community-engaged
research; expansion of efforts to enhance inclusion of under-represented populations; expansion of a rural

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects more than 50 million people worldwide but there is no clear therapeutic option
for the patients. For last two decades, AD research has been focusing on a neuron-centric biochemical process
that leads to synaptic deficits and neuronal degeneration. However, recent failures in clinical trials clearly
demonstrate a gap in knowledge in our current understanding of AD pathogenesis and call for studies that lead
to unbiased and holistic understanding of disease pathways in different types of brain cells. This project aims to
tackle this important and urgent issue by combining a computational systems biology platform Single-Cell
Resolution Brain Interactome (SCRBI) Explorer, 3D human Alzheimer’s-in-a-dish models, and the publicly
available multiple-omics AD databases through NIH-funded AMP-AD portal. We will expand the knowledge
base of SCRBI Explorer to handle single cell transcriptomic and multiple omics profiles from 3D cell models
and human brain tissues, which can detect on multiple layers of neuron-glia and glia-glia crosstalk pathways
via ligand-receptor interactions, cytokine/chemokine signaling, intracellular signaling activities, and
transcriptional activation. The central hypothesis is that the combined use of multi-cellular systems biology
modeling and 3D human AD cellular models will identify AD-specific neuron-glia and glia-glia crosstalk
pathways, which would provide novel therapeutic targets for drug repositioning. We will test this hypothesis by
pursuing three specific aims: 1) Develop a multi-cellular crosstalk model to uncover altered neuron-glia and
glia-glia crosstalk pathways in AD, 2) identify and validate AD-specific neuron-glia and glia-glia crosstalk
pathways that are enriched in 3D human AD cellular models and human AD brain cells, and 3) evaluate the
therapeutic potential of neuron-glia and glia-glia crosstalk using 3D human neural cell culture models of AD.
The potential impact of this proposal is high because the proposed study, if successful, will provide a unique
integrated bioinformatics tool to unbiasedly identify neuron-glia and glia-glia crosstalk pathways in AD and
even other neurodegenerative diseases. More importantly, it will provide novel therapeutic targets based on
altered neuron-glia interaction pathways in AD and open up a new vista for drug repositioning targeting cell-cell
interactions in the brain of AD patients."
10843061,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cocoa products have become a widely consumed food, with growing demand across the world and steadily
increasing interest in its potential health benefits and anti-aging biology. However, the role of cocoa consumption
on epigenetic aging remains essentially unexplored. There has been compelling evidence for the anti-
inflammatory role of cocoa and cocoa-derived flavanols based upon in vitro and animal models. However, a
critical barrier of research progress remains the lack of definitive large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Accelerated epigenetic aging that comprises DNA methylation changes has recently emerged as a powerful,
novel predictor for lifespan and health span, disease susceptibility, morbidity, and mortality risk. Further,
inflammaging is a highly significant risk factor for both morbidity and mortality in the elderly, as many age-related
diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD) share an inflammatory pathogenesis. As such, interventions
to slow or mitigate epigenetic aging and inflammaging are critical for promoting healthy aging.
 The COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS) is an ongoing randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial RCT of a high-quality cocoa extract supplement (containing 600 mg/d
flavanols, including 80 mg epicatechins), and a multivitamin supplement to reduce the risk of CVD and cancer
in women aged ≥65 years and men aged ≥60 years. COSMOS has randomized 21,444 participants into the trial,
including 2,006 participants with bio-samples already collected at baseline, year 1 and year 2 follow-up.
COSMOS is the only large RCT testing the effects of cocoa extract in women and men, and for multivitamins in
women. Thus, this proposed ancillary study will build upon the parent COSMOS trial to examine the effects of
randomized cocoa or multivitamin supplementation on anti-aging (epigenetic aging and inflammaging) in 600
representative subjects with three bio-sample collections at baseline, year 1, and year 2, as well as measured
CVD risk factors, and examining these findings in the context of CVD outcomes. We will test our central
hypotheses that cocoa supplementation reduces epigenetic aging indices (e.g., AgeAccelHorvath,
AgeAccelHannum, AgeAccelGrim, AgeAccelPheno, and DNAmTLadjAge) and inflammaging (serum hsCRP, IL-
1β, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α) over time. We will also determine to what extent the effects of cocoa supplementation
on inflammaging and CVD risk factors are mediated by epigenetic aging.
 The purported anti-aging health benefits of cocoa-rich products such as dark chocolate have popularized and
increased consumption of cocoa-rich products over the past decade. Moreover, multivitamins remain the most
common dietary supplement taken by at least one-third of older US adults. It remains of critical public health
importance to rigorously test the anti-aging properties of these two supplements via large RCTs for more
definitive evidence of their potential efficacy, and to approve or refute their potential anti-aging benefits."

patients. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following aims: Specific Aim 1 will examine
the association of bacteria with observed corrosion on the surfaces of spine hardware via the
quantification of surface damage and the presence of bacterial associated biomolecules
integrated into the damaged surfaces. To do so we will use surface optical microscopy to
quantify the type and area coverage of surface modification whether wear or corrosion, over the
entire device component, pedicel screw or rod. Optical microscopy determination of corrosion
regions without existing mechanical damage will elucidate the total possible amount of metal
release based on surface area measurements. How these surfaces are modified beyond
mechanical damage will be characterized using Time of Flight-Scanning Ion Mass Spectroscopy
(TOF-SIMS) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Work in Specific Aim 2 will
characterize the bacterial milieu constituting the biofilms on explanted spine hardware in
metallosis cases. Because of the lack of understanding of the in-vivo spinal instrumentation
microbiome, this Aim will identify the common microbes associated with implant corrosion. The
impact of this work will be to give insight to the mechanisms of in-vivo metal corrosion, thus
leading to possible changes in clinical treatments, the necessity of new or modified materials, or
changes to surgical procedures to reduce the risk of metallosis."
10833091,"Empyema is a bacterial infection of the pleural space, a serious complication of pneumonia that carries a
mortality rate of up to 20%, the incidence of which continues to increase worldwide. Intrapleural fibrinolytic
therapy (IPFT) involving the delivery of plasminogen activators has been used to expedite drainage of loculated
pleural effusions, including empyema. Using a new model of Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced empyema in
rabbits we developed a single-dose IPFT with a plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1)-targeted adjunct, which
is 8-fold more effective than PA alone for treatment acute empyema. We also validated the ability of our
Fibrinolytic Potential Assay (FPA) to predict the success of IPFT in patients with empyema. Interestingly, the
efficacy of IPFT in our model of advanced-stage empyema is decreased by 40-50%, similar to what has been
observed in patients. This is, in part, due to a significant decrease in the rate of intrapleural fibrinolysis. To
mitigate the risk of bleeding complications associated with an increase in the dose of PA, we propose multiple
injections of low-dose PAI-1-targeted IPFT to treat advanced-stage empyema. Our objective is to identify
effective PAI-1-targeted IPFT for advanced-stage empyema. Our hypothesis is that successful IPFT in
advanced-stage empyema requires fibrinolytic activity sustained over a longer period of time and neutralization
of PAI-1. The hypothesis will be tested in four Specific Aims: 1. Maximize the efficacy of IPFT in advanced-
stage empyema in rabbits by targeting both the slow rate of fibrinolysis and PAI-1, 2. Develop novel PAI-1
targeting peptides to optimize IPFT in advanced-stage empyema, 3. Determine the mechanisms that result in
increased resistance to IPFT in advanced-stage empyema, and 4. Using the Fibrinolytic Potential Assay to
identify candidates for IPFT prior to treatment. We will select a dosing schedule and use two validated PAI-1
targeting adjuncts (monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and a docking site peptide) to decrease the dose of PA, test
these mechanisms for additivity in PAI-1 targeting to maximize efficacy, and test the efficacy of PAI-1 targeting
peptides selected using phage display technology. We will use the FPA to analyze samples from Phase 2 Clinical
Trial “A Study to Evaluate LTI-01 in Patients with Infected, Non-draining Pleural Effusions” (ClinicalTrials.gov;
NCT04159831). We will use state of the art biochemical techniques to analyze pleural fluid and plasma from
human patients and our unique model of empyema to investigate the molecular interactions of fibrinolysis of
advanced-stage empyema. Our team has the biochemical, pulmonary and technical expertise to successfully
accomplish the proposed work. The project addresses key gaps in our current understanding of the pathogenesis
of pleural organization, optimization of IPFT and development of a new diagnostic approach to predict outcomes
of IPFT. This project is positioned to shift the paradigm of treatments available for patients with extensive pleural
loculation, failed drainage, and advanced-stage empyema."
10817172,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hospitalizations and medication problems after discharge are a major risk factor for poor health outcomes in
older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD). Increased preventable medication
problems, such as unnecessary continuation of medications with neurocognitive adverse effects, emergency
department visits, readmissions, and costs after hospitalization are a significant burden for older adults with
ADRD. A better understanding of how patient and healthcare factors contribute to use of medications with
neurocognitive effects and poor outcomes after hospitalization will inform policies to improve medication-
related outcomes and care transitions in older adults with ADRD. This K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist
Research Career Development Award application (PA-20-203) is to support Antoinette B. Coe, PharmD, PhD,
a pharmacist-scientist and Assistant Professor in the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy. Dr. Coe's
long-term goal is to become an independent investigator advancing the science of medication use in aging with
a research program demonstrating ways to ensure safe and effective medication use in older adults, especially
those who are vulnerable, cognitively impaired, and have ADRD. To achieve this goal, Dr. Coe will carry out
the scientific aims of this proposal along with a robust career development plan in which she will acquire
content expertise in cognitive impairment, ADRD, and aging, gain advanced epidemiology statistics training
including causal inference methods, and develop an understanding of health and public policy impact on
ADRD outcomes. The overarching scientific goal of this mentored-research proposal is to understand how poor
outcomes related to medications with neurocognitive effects after a hospitalization can be mitigated in older
adults with ADRD. This proposal leverages two existing Medicare care programs and payment policies that
include medication reviews as potential solutions to reduce inappropriate neurocognitive medication use after
care transitions: Medicare Part D Comprehensive Medication Reviews (CMR) and Part B Transitional Care
Management (TCM) visits. Using nationally representative Medicare administrative data, the specific aims are
as follows: 1) Identify predictors of inappropriate neurocognitive medication use in older adults with ADRD after
hospitalization, 2) Examine the use of medication reviews (both CMR and TCM) among older adults who have
been hospitalized and assess factors associated with their use, and 3) Test the effectiveness of
comprehensive medication reviews and transitional care management on outcomes in older adults with ADRD
after hospitalization. Dr. Coe will conduct all work at the rich environment of the University of Michigan, with an
exceptional mentoring and advisory team led by Dr. Julie Bynum. The study's results will inform a large-scale
R01-level application testing strategies to increase medication reviews in older adults with ADRD and their
caregivers and motivate Medicare policy changes to ensure safe medication use in older adults with ADRD."
10788353,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Chronic hip pain affects 18.2 million adults annually, with hip-related pain (intra-articular non-arthritic hip pathologies)
accounting for 60% of chronic hip pain cases in young- to middle-aged adults. Surgery and non-operative treatments for 
hip-related pain fail to provide ubiquitous benefit as pain and dysfunction persist for a majority of patients. Individuals with 
persistent pain often reduce their activity to minimize symptoms despite strong evidence that regular physical activity 
reduces chronic musculoskeletal pain. Poor psychosocial health (i.e., low self-efficacy, high pain catastrophizing, and 
kinesiophobia) is common among individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain and further reinforces low participation in 
physical activity. Mind-body interventions improve psychosocial health, yet to date, have not been implemented to provide 
comprehensive, psychologically informed care for patients with hip-related pain. I will fill this gap through the development
(Aims 1 and 2) and feasibility testing (Aim 3) of Helping Improve PSychosocial Health (HIPS), a novel, multimodal mindbody intervention to improve physical activity for sedentary individuals with hip-related pain and poor psychosocial health. 
Following the Fear Avoidance Model (FAM) of chronic pain, the multimodal HIPS mind-body intervention will incorporate 
pain education, mindfulness training, and goal-setting to improve psychosocial health and facilitate focused engagement in 
rehabilitation. I hypothesize that the HIPS mind-body intervention will improve physical activity among sedentary 
individuals with hip-related pain and poor psychosocial health. Increased physical activity will improve pain, function and 
overall well-being. The HIPS mind-body intervention will be delivered by physical therapists in a hybrid in-persontelephone format to reduce geographic barriers and enable the participation of patients without broadband internet access. 
The incorporation of mind-body interventions into psychologically informed clinical practice has demonstrated preliminary
efficacy; however, evidence is lacking to support its’ broad adoption. Findings from this project will directly inform a 
multisite feasibility study (3-year NCCIH R01) of the HIPS mind-body intervention. Rigorous evidence of the feasibility
(this K23 and future multisite feasibility RCT) and efficacy (future R01) of mind-body interventions such as HIPS, and the 
subsequent embedding of mind-body interventions into physical therapy clinics will provide support for the broad adoption 
of psychologically informed rehabilitation. The candidate’s long-term goal is to become an independent, NIH-funded 
scientist advancing psychologically informed rehabilitation by developing and implementing effective mind-body and 
rehabilitative interventions to optimize clinical outcomes and improve well-being for patients with chronic hip pain. This 
K23 will support this goal by providing protected time to complete critical training in mindfulness and mind-body 
intervention development and clinical trials to complement her expertise in physical rehabilitation and biomechanics."

 Aging compromises the numbers/function of mammalian Lgr5+ intestinal stem cell (ISCs), which depend
on niche factors produced by neighboring cell types like stromal cells. Although the necessity of these niche
factors has been tested in vitro, many uncertainties remain regarding their in vivo sources and the impact of
aging on them. To address these questions, we have focused on RSPO3, the dominant R-spondin in the
mammalian intestine and Lgr5 ligand that drives ISC self-renewal. Using novel Rspo3-GFP mice, we have
discovered that RSPO3 is expressed by two distinct populations in the intestinal stroma: RSPO3+GREM1+
fibroblasts (RG fibroblasts) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). We have established heterotypic co-culture
systems of RSPO3+ stromal cells with intestinal epithelial organoids, and have found that RG fibroblasts, more
than LECs, support organoid growth. Importantly, the numbers/function of RG fibroblasts decline
significantly in old mice. By RNA-seq, we have discovered that S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (Ahcy),
a rate-limiting enzyme in methionine metabolism that hydrolyzes S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH), is the most
downregulated gene in aged mouse RG fibroblasts compared to their young counterparts. Furthermore,
pharmacological inhibition of Ahcy recapitulates the age-related decline in the ability of RG fibroblasts to support
ISCs, whereas short-term methionine restriction reverses the age-related decline of RG fibroblasts. We
hypothesize that Ahcy loss and methionine accumulation in RG fibroblasts account for some of the age-related
deficits of old ISCs that can be reversed by short-term dietary methionine restriction. In this proposal, we will test
the hypothesis that RG fibroblasts are the dominant niche cells that foster ISCs in vivo (Aim 1); that loss of Ahcy
leads to the age-related decline of RG fibroblasts through accumulation of methionine cycle intermediate
metabolites (Aim 2); and that short-term dietary methionine restriction rejuvenates aged mouse RG fibroblasts
to support ISCs and ISC-mediated regeneration (Aim 3).
 Through these aims, we will provide novel insights into how age-related changes in the ISC stromal niche
contribute to ISC aging and how we can reverse it through modulating methionine metabolism. Identification of
a new dietary intervention that may augment intestinal regeneration in old age will have important clinical
implications. My goal is to discover novel insights into how aging influences stem cells with the long-term goal of
translating these findings back to the clinic for the improvement of patient health. Because little is known about
the aging and metabolism of stromal niche cells in ISC biology, the novel tools that I develop and the skill sets I
acquire to assess metabolism of aging stromal niche cells during the K99 training period will permit me to
establish a successful and independent research program as I transition to independence."

 This K23 award application is for Eric Liotta, MD, a neurointensivist and Associate Professor of Neurology
at Northwestern University. Dr. Liotta’s long-term goal is to become an independent physician scientist with
expertise in the interactions between the brain and the body, in order to improve neurologic outcomes and
reduce the risk of subsequent dementia following acute medical illness. To accomplish this goal, he will pursue
a patient-oriented research agenda focused on delirium and encephalopathy with hepatic encephalopathy (HE)
and COVID-19 associated encephalopathy (CAE) models. His mentored research program leverages career
development activities through applications to the proposed research, culminating in his transition to research
independence. He will develop broadly applicable expertise in systemic metabolic analysis, neurophysiologic
evaluation, cognitive impairment and quality of life outcomes assessment, and patient-oriented research
methods. He has assembled a team of mentors who will guide him in the transition to independent researcher.
Farzaneh Sorond, MD PhD (mentor) is a neurointensivist who studies cerebral autoregulation, aging, and
vascular cognitive impairment; Shyam Prabhakaran, MD MS (co-mentor) is a vascular neurologist who studies
acute cerebrovascular disease with a focus on imaging-based markers of risk; and W. Taylor Kimberly, MD PhD
(co-mentor) is a neurointensivist who studies cerebral and systemic metabolism in acute stroke.
 Acute encephalopathy (frequently called delirium) is pervasive in hospitalized patients. Encephalopathy
survivors are at increased risk for cognitive impairment, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer’s dementia, though
the mechanisms are unknown. Treating encephalopathy is hampered by incomplete knowledge of the relevant
systemic derangements and the brain’s physiologic response to those derangements and their clinicopathologic
syndromes. Dr. Liotta will investigate the hypothesis that osmolality and amino acid metabolic derangements
result in cellular brain injury, cerebral edema, and impaired cerebral autoregulation that manifest acutely as
encephalopathy, and chronically as cognitive impairments and elevated risk of early dementia development.
Aim 1 will investigate the mechanism between metabolic derangements and cellular injury, cerebral edema,
and cerebral autoregulation. Aim 2 will investigate the mechanism between cellular injury, cerebral edema, and
cerebral autoregulation and clinical encephalopathy (delirium) severity. Aim 3 will investigate the mechanism
between encephalopathy (delirium) burden and subsequent cognitive impairment. The study will use (1)
repeated assessments of metabolic and physiologic derangements to elucidate the relationship with
encephalopathy severity and (2) longitudinal follow up to investigate the relationship to cognitive impairment. By
completing these aims, Dr. Liotta will gain a substantive foundation in brain-body interactions during acute
illness that can be utilized to elucidate mechanistic targets to reduce cognitive impairment and risk of vascular
dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia following encephalopathy and acute medical illness."

The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify CVH trajectories from birth through age 20 among a diverse
cohort of 7,000 children and their families who already have clinical phenotyping to which we will add detailed
behavioral data and follow them longitudinally. Using an innovative study design for a pragmatic cohort utilizing
technology-enabled data collection we will recruit a diverse cohort of children from a city-wide electronic health
record (EHR) system in Chicago. Parents/children will complete a developmentally appropriate and clinically
feasible set of online surveys and questionnaires to assess behaviors and lifestyles that will be linked with their
EHR data already being used in a prior study. After two years we will re-assess each child's CVH. Our
innovative accelerated longitudinal study design (ALD) will allow us to define CVH and create trajectories for a
diverse group of children from birth through age 20 all within the 5 years of this grant. These trajectories will
then be used to create a novel “CVH growth curve” ready for use in clinical practice. Our team has the
unique expertise to complete this study including already having the EHR data for children across Chicago,
expertise in cohort recruitment and retention as well as inclusion of leading experts in studying CVH among
children. The findings from this study will be critical in targeting prevention strategies to high-risk children and
critical periods during the life course in order to prevent the loss of CVH in childhood and preserve and
promote CVH across the life course. We will develop a clinical tool, CVH growth curves, that can be directly
translated into clinical care and will inform prevention efforts. Our specific aims are as follows:
Specific Aims:
1. Identify CVH trajectories from birth to young adulthood within a diverse cohort of participants
 (n=7,000) across the city of Chicago
2. Identify predictors of CVH trajectories from birth to young adulthood within a diverse cohort of

 Mental disorders cause immense disability, accounting for 183.9 million disability-adjusted life-years world-
wide. Among currently available pharmacological and behavioral interventions, no single therapy is universally ef-
fective. Moreover, treatment responses are far from adequate across mental disorders. As such, there is an urgent
need to optimize treatment responses. Various factors appear to be associated with positive treatment responses
for mental disorders, thus providing evidence for improving response rate by incorporating patient-speciﬁc charac-
teristics in treatment decisions in an effort to achieve precision psychiatry. However, existing methods to incorpo-
rate patient-speciﬁc characteristics do not adequately address the unique challenges facing precision psychiatry.
To point, treatment decision making for mental disorders is inevitably confronted by extensive diagnostic hetero-
geneity, substantial between-patient variation in biological and clinical manifestations of disease, and mismatch
between diagnostic categorization and the underlying pathophysiology. To address these emerging challenges,
this proposal aims to develop novel machine learning and statistical inference methods to build individualized treat-
ment rules to account for the extensive heterogeneity and between-patient variability and integrate evidence from
multi-domain brain and behavioral data across several disorders. Speciﬁcally, we aim to: (1) learn optimal latent
representation of patients through a probabilistic generative model that has theoretical support under the National
Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC); (2) incorporate prior optimal treat-
ment information from the non-randomized phase of clinical trials through targeted transfer learning; (3) synthesize
individualized treatment decision rules learned from multiple studies; and (4) provide rigorous statistical inference
of ﬁtted decision rules. Following the RDoC call for centering mental health research around latent constructs
shared across disorders, the methods developed here will be applied to a range of randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) of patients with major depressive disorder and other co-morbid disorders, including multiple high-quality
RCTs with multi-modality data (e.g., symptoms, behavioral tests, psychosocial measures, brain measures). This
strategy will allow for examination of treatment strategies for constructs shared across disorders and thus will in-
crease generalizability. In sum, this research will use machine learning approaches and statistical inference in
an effort to better leverage the complex interplay between biomarkers and clinical manifestations in the context of
precision psychiatry, with the goal of selecting the best treatments for patients with mental disorders."

This is a renewal application of the SMART MIND (Summer Mentoring and Research in Transdisciplinary
Methodologies in the Neuroscience of Drug-Abuse) Program conducted at the University of Texas at El Paso
(UTEP). Over the past 10 years of funding, we have provided an intensive training experience for 79
undergraduates, 18 high school teachers, and 8 high school students from underrepresented groups in
science. Our overarching goal is to provide quality and effective summer experiences for diverse trainees to
increase knowledge and skills in substance use disorders (SUDs). The program will utilize a transdisciplinary
approach, involving training from a 13-member Interdisciplinary Faculty Team (IFT) on state-of-the-art
behavioral and molecular bench science, community-based and health disparities research to address the
multifaceted impact of SUDs on the brain and behavior. Each research cohort will consist of 12 undergraduate
students, 6 of which will be local from UTEP or community colleges majoring in neuroscience and public
health-related fields. The other 6 students will be recruited from outside El Paso, focusing on minority-serving
institutions. This will increase program reach outside of the El Paso area while continuing to promote the
involvement of underrepresented minorities in biomedical research. The program will also amplify outreach
efforts to El Paso area high schools by including hands-on training for 3 high school teachers to incorporate
low-cost neuroscience methods and SUD research knowledge into their curriculum. The program will also
partner with Americans for Medical Progress (AMP) to invite local high school students to UTEP to network
and learn more about science and SUD research careers. Specifically, this program aims at:
1) Continuing to increase the number of undergraduate students conducting research in neuroscience and
related fields to provide information that will help reduce health disparities produced by SUDs and
2) Further increasing the number of high school teachers and students in the El Paso region with research
skills and knowledge related to neuroscience and SUDs."

Skeletal muscle is a highly vascularized tissue that can secrete cytokines and proteins, collectively termed as
myokines. Despite the tremendous potential for translation, due to the dynamic nature of blood-borne factors,
reliable identification of these humoral factors remains a major hurdle. To overcome this challenge, Dr. Jang and
Dr. Park’s group will leverage advanced microengineering approaches to build a 3D microfluidic muscle circuit
that can control mechanical and biochemical cues in the physiologically relevant 3D microenvironment. In this
proposal, two groups will further refine and upgrade the in vitro muscle platform by integrating a cell-type-specific
protein labeling system (MetRSL2774G transgene) to precisely identify the muscle secretome responsible for the
muscle-to-remote organ communications. In addition, the team will also engineer an exercise-induced myokine
reporter system using an optogenetic actuator (Channel-rhodopsin 2) co-expressed with protein labeling
construct, MetRSL274G. Using these approaches, proposed studies will identify novel contraction-induced
myokines that are responsible for the beneficial effects of exercise. Finally, the research team seeks to identify
muscle proteomes that exert their action on muscle-heart crosstalk, especially in the context of ischemic
preconditioning. The successful outcomes of this project will have far and broad implications in muscle biology
and medicine. This minimally invasive 3D microphysiological system can be exploited in a variety of studies
testing systemic tissue interactions. More importantly, upon validation, the experimental approach used in this
proposal can be translated to develop myokine-based therapeutics for late-onset lifestyle disorders."
10763886,"Cardiac myocyte protein quality control is critical for maintenance of the contractile apparatus and cardiac
function. Mutations in chaperone proteins that affect protein quality control induce proteotoxicity, sarcomere
dysfunction and cardiac myocyte cell death. One such point mutation in the CRYAB gene in humans, results in
an arginine to glycine change at position 120 in the heat-shock protein beta-5 (R120G HSPB5) protein, and
provokes autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy resulting in heart failure, need for cardiac transplantation and
premature mortality. Strategies to prevent proteotoxicity have focused on stimulating the autophagy-lysosome
pathway to remove protein aggregates; and need to be refined for maximizing therapeutic benefit. Our studies
during the current grant-funding period have uncovered an essential role for TRAF2, an innate immunity
protein, in mediating basal mitophagy in cardiac myocytes. Our preliminary data show that loss of mitophagy
with TRAF2 ablation in cardiac myocytes induces marked protein aggregation in cardiac myocytes, despite a
lack of effect on general macro-autophagy. In a mouse model of cardiac myocyte specific human HSPB5
R120G mutant protein expression, we have uncovered evidence for mitochondrial accumulation of HSPB5
protein, along with polyubiquitinated proteins and p62 (an adaptor protein essential for aggregate formation).
This is accompanied with markedly increased TRAF2 expression in the mitochondria and reduced
mitochondrial protein content, pointing to a role for mitophagy in handling protein aggregate pathology. Given
recent observations in yeast and mammalian cell lines indicating that mitochondria may facilitate uptake and
degradation of cytosolic protein aggregates, we hypothesize that mitophagy facilitates removal of cytosolic
protein aggregates of HSPB5 R120G mutant protein in cardiac myocytes to prevent cardiac myocyte death
and cardiomyopathy. In this renewal application, we have generated reagents and developed collaborations to
test this hypothesis via the following aims. In aim 1, we will examine if mitophagy is required for removal of
protein aggregates in mice. Studies will also be performed in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
cardiac myocytes (iPSC-CMs) with CRISPR targeted ablation of TRAF2, and in those with CRISPR-knock-in of
R120G mutation. In aim 2, we will examine if TRAF2-induced mitophagy is sufficient to facilitate removal of
protein aggregates in mice and in human iPSC-CMs. Aim 3 will focus on mechanistic studies to understand the
steps involved in mitochondrial uptake of HSPB5 R120G mutant protein uptake in mitochondria. Studies in
mice will focus on impairing p62-mediated protein aggregation to examine the role of p62 in mitochondrial
protein aggregate uptake. Experiments in yeast and mouse model systems will examine if hsp104, a yeast
disaggregase protein shown to be functional in mammalian cells, is required and sufficient for mitochondrial
protein aggregate uptake, respectively. These studies will determine the role of mitophagy in cytosolic protein
quality control, and efficacy of therapeutically harnessing this pathway to treat proteotoxic cardiomyopathy."
10842369,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract)
In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of
obesity. Of various epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation is this most stable; once established during
development, DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable and can persist for many years in humans.
Compared to genetic epidemiology, however, studying epigenetic determinants of obesity is much more
complicated, for two main reasons. First, epigenetic mechanisms are largely cell type-specific, so studying
DNA methylation in easily accessible tissues (like peripheral blood) does not generally provide information
about epigenetic regulation in organs important to energy balance (like the brain). Second, obesity itself can
affect DNA methylation patterns, so `reverse causality' is a problem. Over the last decade we pioneered an
approach to circumvent these obstacles by identifying human genomic regions that exhibit systemic
interindividual variation in DNA methylation (correlated regions of systemic interindividual variation –
CoRSIVs). Last year we reported the identification of nearly 10,000 human CoRSIVs. These regions are stable
and systemic epigenetic variants – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms - enabling large-scale epigenetic
epidemiologic studies using peripheral blood DNA. Our initial screen was conducted in Caucasians, and our
data show that there are many more human CoRSIVs to identify. Given that African Americans are both
grossly underrepresented in genomic and epigenomic analyses, and disproportionately overburdened by
obesity, it is now urgent to scale up and diversify our CoRSIV screen by studying African Americans directly.
Accordingly, our Aims in this project are to 1) Perform an unbiased screen for CoRSIVs in African American
donors in the NIH Gene-Tissue Expression program (GTEx), 2) Validate systemic interindividual epigenetic
variation and cross-tissue prediction of gene expression in a large sample of African Americans, and 3) Test
whether CoRSIV methylation at birth predicts risk of childhood obesity in AA children. We anticipate that
completion of our project will transform the study of epigenetics in human obesity, and epigenetic epidemiology
in general. The focus of this project on African Americans is justified both scientifically and from the basis of
social justice."

A safe, effective, affordable and acceptable vaccine against HIV has been an epidemic-ending goal for decades,
and recent years have seen substantial progress towards developing and testing promising candidate vaccines.
For highly vulnerable groups like adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in sub-Saharan Africa, access and
uptake of vaccines will be essential for reducing the exceptionally high HIV incidence observed in recent years.
This is particularly true in South Africa, which has the world's largest HIV epidemic and several active HIV vaccine
trial programs. While an HIV vaccine has the potential to substantially reduce HIV risk, realizing this potential will
require widespread vaccine uptake. Unfortunately, the lived experiences of both the HIV epidemic and the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have laid the groundwork for an infodemic of misinformation about the HIV
vaccine. Likely attributes of the HIV vaccine (e.g., partial protection against HIV), low trust in governmental and
medical research institutions, and poor understanding of how vaccines work will leave an HIV vaccine program
vulnerable to misinformation among the populations who would most benefit from vaccine-induced protection.
To realize the benefits of future HIV vaccines, novel communication strategies are needed to “inoculate”
individuals at highest risk of HIV infection against contagious vaccine misinformation. In this study, we bring
together two promising approaches – psychological inoculation theory and behavioral economics – to fight HIV
vaccine misinformation. Psychological inoculation theory offers a compelling approach to building “resistance”
to vaccine misinformation through explicit exposure to a “weakened” version (via direct refutation) of false
arguments underlying misinformation, before stronger versions of misinformation are encountered. Importantly,
by
posits
debunking
 prebunking (or pre-emptively warning individuals about) emerging misinformation, inoculation theory also
that t hey will be better able to r esist future misinformation. Prebunking avoids the greater challenge of
 once misinformation has lodged. In addition, behavioral economics provides a complementary
framework that recognize the cognitive and attentional constraints faced by individuals and can inform more
effective inoculation messages. We propose a randomized controlled trial of inoculation messages with a
behavioral economics “boost” with AGYW in South Africa, a population highly vulnerable to both HIV infection
and to vaccine misinformation. Mirroring a vaccine trial, our behavioral trial will evaluate the efficacy, safety,
durability, and generalized immunity effects of inoculation messages that are boosted with behavioral economics
insights. We will also evaluate differential responses to the messages by important subgroups of AGYW. This
proof--of-concept project has the potential to identify innovative communication strategies to build resistance to
emerging and evolving HIV vaccine misinformation. Results from the study will advance the science of HIV
vaccine demand creation and inoculation-theory based approaches to vaccine communication."

The Integrated Membrane Program (IMP) T32 Training Grant will address an important gap that exists in the
biomedical workforce of the future. The IMP will address research training needs in the area of biological
membranes (biomembranes), which are crucially important structures that define and separate physical spaces
within and outside cells, making them fundamental to life on Earth. However, biomembranes do much more, as
they control intracellular signaling and development, are required for energy production, mediate drug delivery
and drug resistance, are essential for making essential cellular macromolecules, and affect growth and
movement, which impacts cancer and other diseases. Thus, understanding biomembranes impacts many critical
areas of biomedical research. Biomembranes research as a field covers the mechanisms by which membranes
are synthesized from their constituent proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, are trafficked and changed in response
to the environment, and then in turn affect the many processes described above. Additionally, human
manipulation of natural and synthetic membranes can be harnessed for myriad applications from computation to
energy production to the development of new materials. Multiple fields and disciplines including biology, physics,
chemistry, engineering, and computational science have applicability to biomembranes, but increasingly, there
is a need for scientists who can bridge these fields and integrate different approaches to meet the next generation
of research challenges. The University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UT) has unique breadth and depth in
biomembrane research, with federally funded, collaborative researchers spanning 7 departments in 4 colleges.
The 32 faculty in the IMP mentor pool have a shared commitment to establish a training program that will span
fields and disciplines. These scientists are already working together through the establishment of the UT-
facilitated Community of Scholars (COS) for Biomembranes, which has met 2-3 times every semester since
2018, and where many students have presented seminars on their research. The shared research, training, and
overall momentum that exists within the Biomembranes COS forms the foundation for the IMP T32. Multiple
investigators within the Biomembranes COS have ongoing collaborations that span fields and disciplines, and
have co-mentored graduate students. The establishment of a T32-based IMP will formalize this integrated
approach to training so these students can advance fundamental knowledge of biomembranes and apply this
knowledge to improve human health. In addition to integrated training in science, the IMP will further enhance
training in responsible conduct of research, reproducibility, and diversity and inclusion, which are already being
addressed at UT, but will be formalized under this NIH T32 mechanism."

Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that protect the ends of linear chromosomes and thereby
maintain genome stability. Telomeres solve both the end-protection and the end-replication problems: 1)
They inhibit DNA damage at chromosome ends, which would otherwise resemble broken DNA, 2) Since
chromosome ends shorten during replication, telomeres act as buffer sequences to prevent loss of coding
regions, 3) Once telomeres become too short, they can no longer inhibit DNA damage, leading to
permanent cell cycle arrest (senescence). This “mitotic clock” is a critical tumor-suppressive barrier that
forces aging cells to stop dividing. To become cancerous, cells must acquire unlimited division potential
by activating a telomere maintenance mechanism, either reactivation of telomerase, the enzyme that
elongates telomeres during development, or through the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)
mechanism, which is based on recombination.
Telomeres consist of 5-15kb of (TTAGGG)n repeats organized into tightly packed nucleosomes and
bound by the shelterin, a complex of six non-histone proteins. Telomeres are considered as
heterochromatin and are enriched in the repressive H3K9me3 “histone mark”. Intense focus has been
placed on trying to decipher the exact chromatin status of telomeres, but the much more important
question has been neglected and remains unanswered: What is the role and function of
heterochromatin at telomeres? While the roles of shelterin proteins have been extensively studied, the
function of heterochromatin at telomeres remains largely unexplored.
Using a novel approach to locally and specifically modulate histone methylation at telomeres, we
will thoroughly dissect the function of H3K9me3 in telomere protection and maintenance. By
fusing histone modifying enzymes to the shelterin protein TRF1, we can locally enrich or deplete
H3K9me3 at telomeres.
Our preliminary data revealed that loss of H3K9me3 leads to severe replication defects and de-repression
of telomere transcription. These data suggest that heterochromatin could play unanticipated roles in the
regulation of replicative aging and the onset of senescence. Moreover, while the general consensus is
that ALT is associated with less condensed chromatin at telomeres, we found that H3K9me3 is a driver
of ALT activity.
Using this unique approach to manipulate H3K9 trimethylation at telomeres, we will methodically
determine the function of this heterochromatin mark on the protective properties of telomeres (end-
protection, end-replication, entry into senescence) as well as on the ALT mechanism of telomere
maintenance."
10833519,"As access to antiretroviral therapy for HIV has expanded in sub-Saharan Africa, millions of persons with HIV
are surviving for decades on treatment, but they are developing chronic non-communicable disease (NCD)
complications that require new science and new directions in prevention, detection, and treatment. Recogniz-
ing that investigation and control of NCDs can be most effectively undertaken by highly trained local investiga-
tors, the University of Zambia (UNZA)-Vanderbilt Partnership for HIV Nutrition Research Training (UVP-1) has
supported PhD training for 11 Zambian scientists pursuing a wide range of HIV-NCD research and has
helped strengthen the UNZA PhD program and the culture of mentorship at UNZA.
We are now transitioning the UNZA-Vanderbilt Training Partnership for HIV-NCD Research (UVP-2) to
UNZA as the prime institution. Our goals are to build UNZA’s research capacity by continuing our “sand-
wich” model of PhD training and by using a similar model to develop a postdoctoral training program,
with a view to creating a pipeline of independent UNZA scientists. We will also introduce new research
training mechanisms and support structures at UNZA to ensure sustainability. Specifically, we will:
1. Train five (5) UNZA PhD students and four (4) UNZA postdoctoral scientists in advanced basic, clini-
 cal/translational, epidemiologic, and implementation sciences to address the complications and comorbidi-
 ties most relevant to lifelong HIV management in sub-Saharan Africa
This aim focuses on training individuals. Both training programs will use our very successful “sandwich” for-
mat with Africa- and U.S.-based components. Postdoctoral training is itself innovative for UNZA, and we
will leverage Vanderbilt’s investments in postdoctoral research career development and intensive grant writing
training through the Vanderbilt’s very successful Institute for Research Development and Ethics (VIRDE).
2. Strengthen UNZA’s capacity to train researchers, attract research funding, and generate high-impact
 research outputs across a broad range of HIV-NCD investigations
This aim focuses on UNZA’s research training capacity. UVP-2 will support UNZA’s new postdoctoral fel-
lowship mechanism by replicating key Vanderbilt career development resources at UNZA, principally those
associated with successful grant applications, and three-month sabbaticals for four (4) UNZA Visiting Faculty
Scholars at Vanderbilt, focused on developing collaborations and submitting grant applications.
3. Ensure and document UVP’s long-term impact under experienced UNZA leadership
This aim focuses on program impact, which we will evaluate by tracking careers, grants, publications, re-
search teams, and discoveries. The UNZA-Vanderbilt Partnership has proven highly efficient in catalyzing re-
search capacity at UNZA. The addition of the new postdoctoral fellowship and the formation of infrastructure to
increase UNZA’s grant support will usher in a new era of research growth and impact."
10833596,"Project Summary
This proposal requests a third renewal of a highly successful T32 Institutional National Research Service Award
to Indiana University, entitled “Common Themes in Reproductive Diversity” (CTRD). The award will support
broadly integrative training in the areas of sexual reproduction and development. Training will focus on behavior
in both humans and other animals and will address key questions in three related themes: (1) Developmental
contributions to reproductive behavior, (2) Origins and expression of differences among the sexes, and (3)
Interactions between sex, health, and disease. Indiana University's excellent support for research and its globally
recognized strengths in animal behavior, endocrinology, human sexual health, and evolution of development will
ensure high quality training. The 21 Training Faculty and 6 Affiliated Resource Faculty are drawn from 3 schools
(Medical, Public Health, College of Arts and Sciences, including Ph.D. granting departments in the College (e.g.,
Anthropology, Biology, Gender Studies, Psychological and Brain Sciences) and 3 additional degree-granting
programs (Medical Sciences, Neuroscience, and Cognitive Science). They are also associated with 1 or more
of 5 research centers, most importantly the Center for the Integrative Study of Animal Behavior (CISAB), the
Kinsey Institute for Research on Sex, Gender and Reproduction, and the Center for Genomics and
Bioinformatics. Support is requested for five years to enable training of 4 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral students
each year to be drawn from a deep pool of talented applicants. In addition to course work in the fundamentals
and intensive research training, trainees will participate in (1) a research-based course focused on Concepts in
Reproductive Diversity, (2) an interdisciplinary, hands-on methods course, Techniques in Reproductive Diversity,
a 3) a Research Ethics course, and 4) a Professional development course all co-taught by the training faculty
and enhanced by invited distinguished visiting scientists. Active participation in a monthly breakfast research
forum and other opportunities will allow trainees to accomplish important professional training including creating
individual development plans (IDPs), preparing for more than one career outcome, and enhancing the
reproducibility and transparency of their research. Trainees will also organize and present research at a highly
successful and broadly attended CISAB conference. Predoctoral trainees will be drawn from the most highly
qualified applicants to the degree-granting programs of the Training Faculty. Postdoctoral trainees will be
recruited nationally, will be chosen based on their accomplishments and the potential for CTRD training to
broaden their skills and perspectives, and will be expected to foster research collaboration among CTRD trainees
and laboratories. Intense effort will be made to enhance recruitment and retention of diverse trainees, to provide
mentoring opportunities through a highly effective undergraduate program for underrepresented minorities, and
to recruit and support individuals with disabilities or from disadvantaged backgrounds."
10863835,"SUMMARY
The predoctoral Cellular, Molecular and Quantitative Biology Training Program (CMQBTP) will be a
comprehensive, rigorous and forward-thinking program designed to graduate the leaders of the 21st century
biomedical workforce. It will bring together a group of talented students from diverse backgrounds interested in
developing the technical, operational, and professional skills essential for their future careers both in and
outside of academia. These students will apply to the CMQBTP through two graduate admission tracks that
feed four degree granting departments: Cell Biology, Genetics, Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology,
and Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry. Thus, the students will be immersed in an interdisciplinary training
environment that prioritizes collaborative team science based on rigorous and quantitative experimental design
and analysis. Our 60 training faculty are diverse and represent all ranks of the academic ladder. They have all
been National Research Mentoring Network-trained and thus prioritize mentoring students within a safe,
equitable and supportive environment. The mission of the CMQBTP is to develop rigorously trained early-
career scientists prepared to operate ethically as future scientific leaders. It will advance 6 Training Objectives
so that trainees master a well-defined set of transferable technical, operational and professional skills. This will
be facilitated by a set of CMQBTP-specific courses and activities designed to not only teach the specific skills
but also to build a cohesive cross-cohort community of scholars. Activities for CMQBTP trainees throughout
their graduate career are designed to enrich their education while providing experiences to effectively inform
their future career choices. We will lead a “Skills Development for Diverse Scientific Careers” (to develop
transferable skills beyond academia), Informational Interview workshops (to help identify viable career options),
a course on “Statistical Inference and Models in Molecular and Cellular Biology” (to enhance reproducibility
and rigor), an annual student-run Symposium Retreat (to develop leadership skills) and regular research in
progress talks (to learn about their exciting discoveries). These activities are paired with peer mentoring and
community building initiatives designed to forge a sustainable CMQBTP community that will persist beyond
graduate school. To ensure the continued growth and improvement of our program, we have instituted a
modern set of evaluation tools designed by PhD-level educators well-trained in program assessment and are
independent of the CMQBTP leadership. These assessments will provide quantitative metrics to evaluate
whether students are meeting competency benchmarks and whether our faculty are succeeding as trainers.
These assessment and outcome datasets will be made fully available to CMQBTP trainers and prospective
students to better inform their mentorship practices and future career goals, respectively. Particular attention
will be paid to ensure that faculty will be rigorously trained in and evaluated on inclusive mentoring practices to
ensure our mission of creating a CMQBTP that provides equal opportunities for all trainees to flourish."
10848274,"Mental disorders are among the most common causes of disability, and the disease burden is among the highest
of all illnesses. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop not only novel therapeutic approaches but also the next
generation of research scientists who can meet the challenges of the growing field of mental health research.
The overarching goal of this “Predoctoral Training in a Multifaceted Translational Approach to Mental Illness
(AMI)” program (Adrienne Lahti, MD, and Yogesh Dwivedi, PhD as Directors) is to provide the students with an
environment of cross-cultural training where they will be exposed to the clinical challenges, biological
mechanisms, and cutting-edge research approaches used across mental illnesses, rather than the kind of single-
disease training they might obtain by working in an individual research laboratory. The AMI T32 training program
will uniquely provide an interdisciplinary training environment that will integrate basic and translational research
training of predoctoral students to foster the development of critical thinking, communication, and in-depth
research skills. Built on a strong foundation and supported by a large infrastructure of outstanding basic,
translational, and multidisciplinary programs in mental health research, the AMI training program will take
advantage of interdisciplinary mental health research investigative efforts led by strong, internationally renowned
clinical and educational resources within the UAB Department of Psychiatry, dynamic mental health research
efforts by the Comprehensive Neuroscience Center, university-wide interdisciplinary initiatives of the UAB
Depression and Suicide Center, the Comprehensive Center for Translational Sciences, and UAB graduate
programs within the thematically based Graduate Biomedical Sciences and the Psychology Doctoral Program
affiliated with the Department of Psychology. The collaborative environment at UAB, embodied by various cores,
centers, programs, and departments, will provide extensive support for invigorating research efforts. The training
program is requesting three predoctoral training slots per year and will take advantage of well-established best
practices for the successful recruitment of underrepresented minorities and individuals with disabilities. The plan
will include required didactic courses, laboratory and clinical research, journal clubs, seminars, scientific
presentations both locally and at national meetings, and training in the responsible conduct of research. Trainees
will also benefit from courses on grant writing and professional skills development. Together, the trainee and
mentoring team will craft an individual development plan. Internal and External Advisory Committees will
evaluate the overall performance of the AMI training program. A series of benchmarks for progress will be
formulated for each trainee and mentor and reviewed on a semi-annual basis. As a top 25 NIH-funded academic
medical center with state-of-the-art scientific core facilities and university-wide, interdisciplinary research centers,
the University of Alabama at Birmingham is remarkably well-positioned to cultivate a new generation of
translational scientists who will advance and transform mental health research."
10850958,"This is a request for an extension of the training program in Environmental Biostatistics at the Harvard T. H.
Chan School of Public Health. The program prepares pre-doctoral and postdoctoral fellows for research in the
application of biostatistics, statistical genetics and genomics, and data science to the environmental health
sciences. The program will be administered through the Department of Biostatistics, with active participation
by faculty members from the Department of Environmental Health and the Department of Epidemiology, also
located at Harvard Chan. Trainees will receive high-quality instruction in basic biostatistical theory and
methods, such as probability, statistical inference, computing and data analysis. The program also provides
training in specialized topics of particular relevance for environmental applications, such as longitudinal and
spatial data analysis, Bayesian methods, machine and statistical learning, causal inference, statistical genetics,
environmental genomics and other high-dimensional data techniques. Training will also be provided through
substantive course work in environmental health, a regular seminar series called “Environmental Statistics”,
where faculty, students, and fellows present their own environmental health-related research, and annual
symposia. An important focus of training will be the opportunity to collaborate with faculty members from all
three departments on biostatistical research as it applies to environmental health. All trainees will participate in
Harvard's program on scientific integrity in the conduct of research, formal coursework on methods to ensure
reproducible science, formal, hands-on training in strategies for effective interdisciplinary collaboration and
scientific leadership, and practice in grant writing. The program develops an individual development plan for
each trainee, implements a formal mentoring program for junior faculty preceptors, and regularly assesses
current practices by polling current trainees and alumni. Program trainers place particular importance on the
recruitment of students from underrepresented minority groups, participating heavily in a well-established
summer program for undergraduates that consistently places graduates in the program. The focus on
interdisciplinary training at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, as well as its talented and diverse
student body and faculty, makes it ideally suited for a training program in Environmental Biostatistics."
10834900,"The goals of the Training Program in Age-related Neurodegenerative Diseases are to mentor and educate young investigators and prepare them for research careers in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, with an emphasis on Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ADRD) such as Parkinson’s disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). These diseases are a significant and
expanding public health problem due to the rapidly aging global population. Specifically, an effort has been made to encourage the training and mentoring of physician-scientists in the field of neurodegenerative disease.
The program supports 4 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral trainees per year. The program is based at the
Perelman School of Medicine, School of Arts and Sciences, School of Dental Medicine at The University of Pennsylvania, and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Together, these institutions have one of the largest programs on neurodegenerative disease research in the country, with a funded base of >$90 million as determined by federal, pharmaceutical and foundation grants led by the 31 faculty who serve as T32 trainers. Among the many individuals who study neurodegenerative diseases on our campus, a select group of 31mentors are associated with this T32 program. We note that 13/31 (42%) of our trainers are women, 1 identifies as non-binary, and 2/31(6%) are minorities under-represented in science and medicine. In our program, we place specific emphasis on collaborative science and a commitment to training students and postdoctoral fellows: all trainers have published numerous papers with other trainers, 12 of the trainers share jointly funded NIH grants with other trainers, 20 of our trainees have published with 2 or more trainers, there are many joint lab meetings, and our trainers participate in extensive programmatic activities and minority recruitment efforts. 
Among the four current predoctoral trainees, two (studying cognitive decline and the microbiome; studying VCP mutations in tau-related dementias) work in areas directly related to AD/ADRD. Among current postdoctoral trainees, four (studying how seizure activity affects tau spreading in AD; studying tau biology; studying polygenic risk for AD and other ADRD; studying TDP-43) work in areas directly related to AD/ADRD. This track record demonstrates our commitment to training AD/ADRD investigators."
10765715,"ABSTRACT
Despite tremendous advances in treatment of HIV/AIDS and the decrease of HIV incidence, the overall infected
population continues to grow. Progress on prevention of HIV transmission remains far too slow. It is estimated
that 20% of new HIV infections are due to transmission from unaware infected individuals. Hence, early detection
of HIV is particularly important for lowering transmission rates. To this end, extending testing accessibility beyond
clinical settings through self-tests is highly desirable. HIV self-testing is a process in which an individual who
wants to know his/her HIV status collects a specimen, performs the test, and interprets the result in private.
Current HIV self-testing technologies include rapid protein tests and nucleic acid tests. The suboptimal sensitivity
of current protein tests can only support antibody detection and will miss a significant portion of acute infections.
Although nucleic acid tests can reach lower detection limit through amplification technologies such as PCR, they
will miss the information that antigens can provide. Most current research efforts on HIV self-testing are focused
on nucleic acid tests. However, there is no evidence showing that HIV RNA appears ahead of antigen. The major
technological challenge for antigen detection is that proteins cannot be amplified like nucleic acids, leading to
the widely held belief that antigen tests are relatively insensitive and therefore have a limited clinical utility.
We previously demonstrated a click chemistry amplified nanopore (CAN) assay method for ultrasensitive antigen
quantification. This assay achieved 0.5 pg/ml detection limit for HIV-1 p24 antigen and demonstrated reliable
detection in clinical samples from patients missed by nucleic acid and/or ELISA assays. Quantitative p24 results
from this method also indicated correlation between p24 and viral load, suggesting potential use for monitoring
antiretroviral therapy adherence to minimize treatment failure. Based on the CAN assay, this project aims to
develop an ultrasensitive quantitative HIV-1 p24 antigen self-test to improve early detection of acute infections
and monitoring treatment efficacy. The test will be based on a streamlined automatic device including a cost-
effective microfluidic chip for sample preparation and a nanopore reader for laypersons to test themselves using
fingerprick blood. The R61 phase will develop a self-testing device for quantification of HIV-1 p24 antigen at ≤ 2
pg/ml in whole blood to support detection of acute infection and treatment failure. The R33 phase will perform a
clinical evaluation at the Prisma Health Immunology Center to assess the performance, usability, and
acceptability of the self-testing device. Through innovations in click chemistry amplified nanopore detection and
microfluidic sample preparation, we anticipate the test would be able to quantify HIV-1 p24 antigen at as low as
0.5 pg/ml directly from 100µl or less finger prick blood and establish correlation between p24 and viral load levels.
If successfully developed and validated, this CAN self-testing device should enable routine HIV self-testing as
simple as a blood sugar test at home to support global HIV diagnostic and therapeutic efforts."
10756514,"Social anhedonia—a reduced tendency to enjoy interpersonal relationships and/or reduced interest in social
interactions—poses a significant public health challenge. It is considered one of the most pervasive and
debilitating features of severe mental illness, including psychosis. Social anhedonia substantially influences
social functioning in psychosis, but currently there are no available treatments that target this debilitating
hedonic deficit. Our limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms of social anhedonia presents a major
obstacle for developing and evaluating interventions that target social anhedonia. This application aims to
tackle this lack of knowledge by probing a process that is hypothesized to be central to social anhedonia:
disrupted social reward learning.
We developed our hypothesis from two complementary lines of work: a theoretical model of social anhedonia
in psychosis and a growing body of work from affective neuroscience and behavioral neuroscience. To
examine this hypothesized relationship between social reward learning and social anhedonia, this two-site
study will recruit a sample enriched for social anhedonia (i.e., individuals who are within two years of their first
psychotic episode) and employ a perturbation-based neuroimaging approach. The specificity of the relationship
between reduced sensitivity to social reward and social anhedonia will be examined in two ways. First, we will
employ two social reward learning tasks, each with both social and nonsocial reward conditions. Second, we
will perturb social reward learning using Motivational Interviewing as a probe that is designed to increase
sensitivity specifically to social reward.
Participants will be randomized 1:1 to MI or a time- and format-matched control probe. At pre- and post-probe,
participants will perform two social reward learning tasks in the scanner. We will examine the relationship
between sensitivity to social reward and reduced subjective experience of social pleasure at both the
behavioral and neural levels. The findings of this project will allow direct inferences about underlying
mechanisms beyond demonstrating only the cross-sectional correlations between social reward sensitivity and
social anhedonia. Thus, the findings of this project will provide valuable insights into the mechanistic pathways
of social anhedonia and could provide novel neurobehavioral phenotypes that can serve as targets and
biomarkers for developing novel treatments. Further, social anhedonia is not limited to severe mental illness,
as some individuals with other mental disorders and also without mental illness report social anhedonia. The
findings of this project will be valuable for our future efforts to determine whether the same underlying
mechanism is related to social anhedonia across conditions and populations or not."
10828812,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The objective of this proposal is to test cerebroprotective interventions for the
SPAN program by utilizing an intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model or an
animal blood clot embolic model. Our lab has been using innovative techniques in producing highly consistent
mouse MCAO and clinically relevant animal blood clot embolic stroke models. Our animal surgeons have
more than 15 years of experience in various animal ischemic stroke models and have performed surgeries on
thousands of animals of various species (e.g., mice, rats, and rabbits). We established an easy-to-use
technique to monitor the middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow throughout the peri-MCAO periods. Our
animal operating and behavioral exam rooms have about 900 square feet of space and were completely
renovated in 2019. Our three animal surgical stations with matching monitoring instruments are state-of-the-
art. Our Bruker 9.4 T MRI Scanners are advanced and allow for high-resolution quantitative assessment of
CNS structures and functions. Our state-of-the-art infrastructure, together with our highly skilled personnel,
allows us to run multiple studies in parallel. We have about a decade of experience in performing interactive
multi-institutional projects funded by the NIH. We have published more than ten studies about stroke-related
comorbidities. Death and disability/dependency are always key primary outcome measures in stroke clinical
trials. However, many functional tests in animal stroke studies are not designed to assess animal “natural (i.e.,
minimal investigator interaction)” disability; rather, animals are required or forced to perform tasks. These
tasks are highly useful to test specific deficits but may differ from “natural” disability/dependency that presents
in stroke clinical trials. Therefore, we recently established two novel tests to reflect animal long-term “natural”
disability (unable to work, eat, and drink by themselves): (i) nest building activity measuring ability to work,
and (ii) PhenoTyper monitoring the “total” activity, food and drink intake activities, and time of death. These
long-term “natural” behavioral tests are objective, easy-to-use, measurable, and sensitive, and may mimic the
clinically relevant disability/dependency benchmarks used in stroke clinical trials. In the first year, we will: (i)
set up the required infrastructure and animal models; (ii) sign agreements and participate in all SPAN
meetings; (iii) share data with the Coordinating Center (CC); and (iv) execute the animal studies following the
assignments and protocols set forth by SPAN. In the second year, we will further: (i) execute the animal
studies; (ii) present our results to SPAN for recommendations of go/no-go, and (iii) participate in all SPAN
meetings and share resources, infrastructure, and protocols. In the third year, we will continue to execute the
animal studies and participate in all scheduled SPAN meetings. We will consult the CC: (i) to get a consensus
of the best intervention(s) and, if agreed by the CC, (ii) validate the clinical benefits of the best intervention(s)
with a clinically relevant animal blood clot embolic stroke model."
10851969,"My training goals outlined in this K23 Career Development Award include to: (1) develop the skills to
effectively conduct high-quality, clinically-relevant, mixed-methods analyses of barriers and facilitators of
hospital-based violence intervention program (HVIP) enrollment; and (2) complete an individually-tailored
training program centered in Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) and Dissemination and
Implementation (D&I) Science. This will support my long-term career goal to become an independent
investigator of firearm injury prevention by developing, testing, implementing, and continually refining HVIPs.
HVIPs share common outcome goals (decreasing reinjury and death rates among participants), and are, by
design, individualized programs that provide counseling and social- and case-based services to achieve
additional goals that are unique to each participant. For this reason, I will train in mixed methods study design
that supports real-world applicability and adaptability of our findings. I will use this award to study CBPR and
D&I science to develop the skills necessary to become a leader in HVIP innovation. My career development
plan includes a: (1) robust mentoring plan that provides specific details on mentorship roles and development
milestones to capitalize on the complementary areas of expertise among mentorship team members; and (2)
didactic training plan through the Master of Science in Clinical Investigation program. My research project is a
multi-center, mixed-method analysis of barriers and facilitators of enrollment in Life Outside Violence (LOV),
the St. Louis region-wide HVIP. The cycle of violence is an under addressed public health threat that
disproportionately affects Black patients, especially in St. Louis, which has a very high rate of violent crime.
LOV's mission is to facilitate healing and decrease incidences of retaliation, criminal involvement, reinjury, and
death. In early analysis of 158 LOV enrolled patients, three (2%) have suffered a recurrent violent reinjury—
well below the national rate (up to 77%). However, only 13% of eligible patients enrolled in the LOV program.
To address this enrollment gap, I will investigate the following specific aims, to: (1) Apply multilevel
regression models to the STL-HVIP-DR to identify sociodemographic, service delivery, organization, and
geographic characteristics associated with LOV program enrollment; (2) Assess barriers and facilitators of
enrollment in the LOV program through individual and group interviews with a purposive sample (n~45) of LOV
mentors, community members, and patients who enrolled in LOV and those who did not; and (3) Use CBPR
methods to design and assess an improved engagement pathway to approach violently injured patients for
enrollment in the LOV program. My proposed career development and research plan will address actionable
HVIP implementation barriers and facilitators in real-world conditions. We will disseminate our findings to other
HVIPs through subsequent R01 applications to scale up the new engagement pathway and identify
implementation factors that are consistent across communities to decrease mortality among high-risk patients."
10767963,"Ongoing analyses from our laboratory and others have identified novel properties of self proteins, namely
posttranslational protein modifications (PTMs) that may be identified as early proteomic and immunologic
biomarkers of Type 1 diabetes as well as alter metabolic pathways. An emerging number of self proteins
acquire PTMs and become targets of B and T cell autoimmune responses leading to inflammation and
pathology in the pancreas. Some examples of critical modifications to self proteins include citrullination,
oxidation, deamidation reactions, and isoaspartyl modification, all responses of self proteins within cells that
undergo inflammatory stress. Key PTM candidates have already been identified from human beta cells and
other key candidates will be identified from beta cell derived exosomes, recently identified as a peripheral
marker of beta cell health. As importantly, these PTMs within cells may alter the biological properties of
proteins within beta cells. In the present proposal, we will define how modified self-proteins may alter
enzymatic pathways of glucose sensing and insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta cell. The proposal will
utilize MultiOrdinate Spectral Analysis (MIMOSA), a technology pioneered at Yale University. MIMOSA is a
major innovation that provides an internally cross-validated as well as NMR-validated, direct, rigorous,
comprehensive integrated analysis of metabolic fluxes. The “multi-ordinate” aspect of MIMOSA incorporates
the flow of stable isotope from metabolite to metabolite along intersecting metabolic pathways. The “mass
isotopomer” aspect uses MS/MS-based ion fragmentation analysis of stable-isotope-labeled metabolites to
identify the carbon-specific position of label. The significance and innovation of the present studies is in
identifying pathways that may restore beta cell functions, via pharmaceutical correction of the aberrant
modification, as well as link autoimmune biomarkers with pathways of beta cell dysfunction."

Title: Effect of Hypercapnia Treatment on Respiratory Recovery after Spinal Cord
Injury.
Respiratory and cardiovascular complications are the most common causes of death in
the first year post-injury. Nearly 80% of patients with SCI, including Veterans, suffer from
breathing and sleep disorders after six months of injury. However, most patients with
SCI do not tolerate standard mechanical treatment leading to a lack of adherence.
Therefore, identifying other therapies is important for this common condition linked to
poor outcomes in the general population (heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and poor
cognition). In individuals with SCI, it has been reported that chemical stimulation using
acute intermittent hypoxia techniques improves ventilatory and motor recovery. The
effect of intermittent hypoxia is dependent on the level of alveolar Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
and may pose undesirable cardiovascular effects. However, the effect of hypercapnia
alone on respiratory recovery during wakefulness and sleep in patients with SCI is
unknown.
The purpose of this application is to identify new therapeutic interventions for respiratory
and sleep disorders in Veterans with SCI. This application proposes a pilot study to
enroll 30 Veterans with SCI to receive two weeks of daily acute intermittent hypercapnia
(dAIHc) treatment. There will be three specific aims to address the following hypotheses:
Specific Aim (1): Measure the recruitment rate and feasibility of a pilot intervention
using dAIHc in individuals with SCI.
Specific Aim (2): Test the hypothesis that dAIHc will increase minute ventilation and
respiratory muscle forces in individuals with SCI.
Specific Aim (3): Test the hypothesis that dAIHc will improve sleep parameters in
individuals with SCI."
10810792,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genes play two different roles in biology, giving shape to phenotypes through developmental processes
within individuals, and transmitting traits across generations through Mendelian inheritance. Evolutionary
developmental geneticists work at the intersection of these roles, asking how the mechanisms that operate
within individuals influence the origin, maintenance, and fate of phenotypic variation in populations.
Pleiotropy, dominance, epistasis, polygeny, and linkage are some of the phenomena that unite developmental
and population genetics. One further class of phenomenon – early embryonic development – also bridges this
divide, involving molecular and cellular contributions from the embryo's own zygotic genome but also from
the substance of the egg, a product of its mother's genome. This dual regulation by two genomes creates
distinctive transmission genetics properties for early development, properties that alter predictions about
patterns of variation and divergence.
To better understand how maternal and zygotic genetic effects and their interactions shape variation and
evolution of development, this project sets as its goal the characterization of genetic architectures of
embryogenesis in multiple experimental model systems, each with unique complementary features.
One line of research focuses on Caenorhabditis nematodes, a longstanding experimental model for
developmental genetics. Building on the lab's extensive resources for quantitative genetic analysis in these
animals, the project will use controlled experimental crosses to reveal genetic variants that act either in the
mother's genome or in that of her offspring to influence developmental gene expression. The project will use
two experimental panels of C. elegans, one that maximizes detection power and one that maximizes mapping
resolution. To address questions about the role of mating system in maternal-zygotic coevolution, the project
will also use an experimental panel of C. becei, a closely related species that exhibits obligate outcrossing in
contrast to the self-fertilization that characterizes C. elegans.
A second line of research focuses on variation in embryonic development an annelid model system, Streblospio
benedicti. This species is unique in exhibiting both direct and indirect development as heritable variation, with
the alternative modes representing adaptive strategies to different environmental conditions. This system
provides a directional selection counterpart to the stabilizing selection that Caenorhabditis embryogenesis
experiences. Measurements of embryonic gene expression in a large S. benedicti pedigree will facilitate genetic
dissection of both maternal and zygotic contributions to development and tests of the role of maternal-zygotic
genetic interactions in driving or preventing adaptive evolution."
10841027,"Project Summary
The organization and segregation of replicated chromosomes are fundamental to living systems. Structural
maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes play central roles in these processes in all domains of life.
These ring-shaped ATPases share common structures and inter-subunit contacts, consistent with a common
mechanism of action. Over the last five years, studies in Bacillus subtilis and eukaryotes have provided
compelling in vivo and in vitro evidence that SMC complexes utilize ATP hydrolysis to extrude DNA loops. In the
case of B. subtilis, SMC condensin complexes are loaded at centromeric parS sites near the replication origin,
then translocate down the left and right chromosome arms, tethering them together. In this way, condensins
generate a single chromosome loop centered on the origin that draws sister chromosomes in on themselves and
away from each other. This elegantly simple loop-extrusion model provides a unifying mechanism to explain how
eukaryotic SMC cohesin complexes form topologically associating domains (TADs) in interphase, how eukaryotic
SMC condensin complexes compact DNA into rod-shaped sister chromatids, and how bacterial SMC condensins
resolve newly replicated origins. However, this model raises an important question: how do SMC complexes
extrude DNA loops when the chromosome is coated by numerous proteins and acted upon by replication and
transcription machineries? And how are the topologically loaded complexes released from the chromosome?
The goal of this proposed research is to understand the mechanism of condensin action in the context of cellular
activities, taking advantage of the many molecular and cytological tools we have developed. First, we will
determine how condensins act when they encounter the replisome or other condensin molecules. Second, we
will characterize how condensins are released from the chromosome when they reach the terminus region.
Finally, we will explore condensin’s role in the organization and dynamics of a multipartite bacterial genome that
contains both a circular and a linear chromosome. Taken together, the proposed work has the potential to provide
the general principles of chromosome folding and compaction in all organisms."

Osteotoxic side effects of glucocorticoids, such as osteoporosis and osteonecrosis, limit clinical use. Children
are a particularly vulnerable population as 30-50% of children on chronic glucocorticoids develop an osteotoxic
side effect and there are no-FDA approved treatments for children. Although there have been extensive studies
about glucocorticoid effects on the bone in the mature skeleton focusing largely on osteoclasts and osteoblasts,
knowledge gaps still exist which in the growing skeleton. Bone, particularly growing bone, is highly vascularized.
A unifying histological feature of osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, and impaired skeletal growth, is reduced bone
vasculature. Glucocorticoids impair skeletal angiogenesis, which correlates with skeletal fragility in animal
models. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the key affected cell and intracellular signaling mechanism
involved in glucocorticoid suppression of angiogenesis and its relation to osteotoxic side effects. We have
established a young glucocorticoid-osteotoxic mouse model. We have found that glucocorticoids drastically
reduce type H vessels, a specific subtype of blood vessels associated with osteogenesis. Building on our prior
work demonstrating that Trap+ preosteoclasts secrete platelet-derived growth factor type BB (PDGF-BB), which
recruits endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) to form type H blood vessels, we found that glucocorticoids suppress
Pdgfb transcription by interfering with binding of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) to the Pdgfb promoter.
Decreased PDGF-BB was associated with a decreased number of type H vessels, number of mature
osteoblasts, and decreased bone volume. We hypothesize that glucocorticoid suppression of preosteoclast
PDGF-BB via inactivation of NF-κB is the cause of glucocorticoid impairment of skeletal angiogenesis. In this
proposal, we will dissect the key cellular mechanism involved in glucocorticoid suppression of angiogenesis.
Specifically, we will 1) Demonstrate preosteoclasts are the major cell type in glucocorticoid-suppression of
skeletal angiogenesis. 2) Determine the mechanism of glucocorticoid-suppression of NF-κB-mediated
preosteoclast Pdgfb transcription. 3) Examine efficacy of increasing preosteoclast PDGF-BB for preventing
glucocorticoid-suppression of skeletal angiogenesis. Determination of bone-specific factors that regulate
angiogenesis, which is critical to the growing skeleton, will allow targeted drug therapy to treat and/or prevent
osteotoxic side effects of glucocorticoids in children. Furthermore, identification of the mechanism of
glucocorticoid-suppression of angiogenesis will advance our fundamental knowledge and expand future studies
specifically on osteonecrosis, aid in drug-development for therapeutic interventions, and provide insight into
mechanisms of other off-target tissue side effects observed with chronic glucocorticoid usage."
10807075,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common source of disease, affecting 1 in ~5000 individuals. The
United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation states “every 30 minutes a child is born who will develop a
mitochondrial disease by age 10” (www.umdf.org). The biology of mitochondria makes these problems
tremendously complex. Mitochondrial function requires the coordinated expression of 37 genes
encoded in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inside mitochondria, and over 1000 nuclear-encoded genes
whose products must be transported into mitochondria. The high mutation rate for mtDNA and the large
target of nuclear genes for mutations ensures that every individual has a unique ‘mito-nuclear
genotype’ that can alter fitness. Development in different environments can alter how different
genotypes express adult traits. Thus, these sources of complexity are responsible for key gaps in our
understanding of the genetic bases of mitochondrial disease, and more generally, the genetic variation
for mitochondrial performance in natural populations.
 The Drosophila model we have developed provides a powerful genetic approach to dissect this
complexity. We have introduced different mtDNAs into controlled nuclear genetic backgrounds and
identified genetic interactions (‘mitonuclear epistases’) affecting fitness traits and gene expression. We
have discovered that many of the genes with differential expression resulting from mitonuclear genetic
interactions also show differential expression in response environmental perturbations. Our working
hypothesis is that mitochondria integrate genetic pathways regulating changes in both the internal
cellular, and external physical, environments.
 We will pursue three general questions. First, what signaling pathways underlie the shared gene
expression responses to altered mitonuclear genotypes and altered physical environments? This will be
addressed with gene expression and epigenetic experiments pairing mitonuclear genotypes and
environmental stressors. Second, which nuclear genes regulate mtDNA effects on phenotypes? This
will be addressed with genetic screens of the nuclear genome across a panel of variable mtDNAs.
Third, do mtDNA mutations affect males more than females? The maternal inheritance of mtDNA
allows direct selection in females but prevents selection in males. Male-specific deleterious mutations
could accumulate in populations, a phenomenon known as Mother’s Curse. This will be addressed
using sex-based phenotypic assays in a panel of mtDNA genotypes that span a range of genetic
divergences. Each of these questions is relevant to current challenges in quantitative and medical
genetics. The findings from this research could be informative regarding genetic questions in the
identification of appropriate donors for mitochondrial replacement therapies."
10814278,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the US. Developing novel
and more effective CRC therapies is an unmet biomedical need as most of advanced and metastatic CRCs that
progress after initial therapies respond poorly to therapeutic treatment. The bromodomain and extra-terminal
domain (BET) family proteins such as BRD4 are epigenetic readers that control expression of key oncogenic
proteins that drive CRC initiation and progression. Targeting the BET family proteins using small-molecule
inhibitors has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach. However, BET inhibitors (BETi) as single agents
are generally ineffective against epithelial cancers including CRCs. The molecular mechanisms underlying the
anticancer activity of BET-targeting agents are not well understood. Recently, a new class of agents that induce
rapid degradation of BET proteins has been developed. Our preliminary studies reveal that two such BET
degraders (BETd), BETd260 and BETd246, are much more potent than other BET-targeting agents in CRC cells
and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). We identified a novel, on-target mechanism of action of BETd in
transcriptionally activating Death Receptor 5 (DR5), a key component of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
Importantly, the induction of DR5 is essential for the cell-killing and chemosensitization effects of BETd, and
responsible for increased BETd sensitivity in a subset of CRCs with an activating mutation in Speckle-type POZ
protein (SPOP), a subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase of BET proteins. Furthermore, our data suggest BETd have
robust immunogenic effects by inducing DR5-mediated immunogenic cell death (ICD). A combination of
BETd260 and anti-PD-1 antibody was well tolerated and nearly eradicated mouse CT26 syngeneic tumors in a
DR5-dependent manner. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that BETd improve CRC therapies by
inducing DR5-mediated CRC cell killing and antitumor immunity. Aim 1. Identify the mechanism and biomarkers
of the potent anticancer activity of BETd in CRC cells; Aim 2. Determine the therapeutic efficacy of BETd against
therapy-refractory and metastatic CRCs; Aim 3. Delineate and harness the immunogenic effects of BETd to
improve CRC therapies. The proposed studies are expected to provide new mechanistic insights and establish
key preclinical parameters for using BETd to develop precision and personalized therapies against
therapy-refractory and incurable CRCs. In the long run, these studies may lead to new and improved therapies
against CRCs and other types of cancer."
10771236,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Epithelia and endothelia form barriers that separate the internal and external milieus and maintain isolated
compartments within organisms. These barriers are sealed by intercellular tight junctions that are assembled
over claudin protein polymer networks. Beyond forming the barrier, claudins also create size- and charge-
selective paracellular channels that accommodate ions and water. Because of these divergent functions,
individual claudins are classified as sealing or pore-forming. Studies in mice and humans demonstrate that
mutations of sealing or pore-forming claudins are causes of heritable disorders. Even without mutation,
regulated changes in claudin isoform expression contribute to disease pathogenesis. For example, intestinal
epithelial claudin-2 expression is upregulated in colitis, and we have shown that claudin-2 channel inactivation
by genetic or pharmacological approaches markedly attenuates experimental immune-mediated colitis.
Until recently, claudin channels were thought of as fixed conduits that allow continuous paracellular flux. Our
development of the trans-tight junction patch clamp allowed the paradigm-altering discovery that claudin-2
channels open and close dynamically to create quantal paracellular conductance events (Weber et al, eLife,
2015). This observation generated many new questions with fundamental, translational, and therapeutic
impact. It has not, however, been possible to address these questions using the trans-tight junction patch
clamp method, which measures only a single, very small, area of junction and has proven too labor-intensive
and technically difficult for application beyond our proof-of-principle analyses. For example, it has not, been
possible to determine whether all claudin channels are dynamic; if different claudins create channels with
distinct biophysical properties, e.g., open probability or conductance event size; or how these characteristics
can be modulated by cellular regulatory processes and pharmacologic agents.
This exploratory grant proposal seeks to apply nanotechnology to analysis of claudin channel function by
creating a nanochip populated by an array of individually addressable, nanopillar-mounted electrodes. After
culture of epithelial cell monolayers on these chips, electrodes within lateral intercellular spaces, just beneath
the tight junctions, can be used to evaluate channel conductances. This approach obviates the difficult process
of patching a GΩ seal across the paracellular space between adjacent cells. By eliminating the patch pipette
and making concurrent analysis of multiple junctions and channels within a single monolayer possible, the
tight junction-sensing nanochip will overcome the main limitations of the trans-tight junction patch clamp.
This novel, enabling technology will lead to new fundamental, paradigm-changing discoveries and, ultimately,
knowledge and tools needed for development of agents that regulate cellular tight junction barriers in order to
treat disorders of epithelial barrier function at diverse sites including the gut, kidneys, and lungs."
10731757,"Hearing loss is a highly prevalent and debilitating neurosensory disorder associated with substantially reduced
quality of life and overall health. It currently affects 430 million people worldwide; by 2050 this is expected to
increase to nearly 2.5 billion and result 1 in 10 people requiring rehabilitation. About 50% of cases are predicted
to have a genetic basis, however hearing loss can also be caused by other factors such as age, ototoxic drugs,
noise, infection or injury. Low-cost next generation sequencing technologies have facilitated many genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) and exome sequencing projects that have identified hundreds of variants and genes
associated with hearing loss. There are currently more than 150 loci and over 100 genes associated with non-
syndromic hearing loss, however few candidate genes have been identified for complex phenotypes such as
age-related hearing loss (ARHL) or
presbycusis, which
is becoming increasingly common as the population
ages. A GWAS conducted to identify candidate genes associated with ARHL identified 44 independent genomic
loci associated with hearing loss. A nearest gene was mapped for each SNP identified in this study, yet how this
SNP influences gene function in hearing loss has not been determined. Establishing a linkage between the target
genes and the disease phenotype is a huge challenge that ultimately affects the correct diagnosis; generating
similar phenotypes upon gene inactivation in animal models can establish a strong support for a candidate gene.
We identified 39 orthologs of 44 GWAS candidate genes in zebrafish, and further selected 29 novel genes that
will be tested functionally for their role in hearing loss by (1) generating a library of zebrafish mutants for 29 (and
paralogs) candidate genes associated with ARHL (2) analyzing these mutants via a high-throughput phenotyping
pipeline including morphological, cellular, and behavioral phenotypes. Identifying the functional consequences
of the candidate genes in zebrafish will yield mechanistic insights in disease pathogenesis."
10833573,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic kidney disease (CKD), affecting 15% of US adults, is characterized by a progressive loss of kidney
function. The leading cause of CKD is type-2 diabetes mellitus, and up to 40% of type-2 diabetic patients go on
to develop CKD. Current measures of kidney function are limited in that they estimate glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR), require multiple blood and urine samples over several hours, or detect disease after irreversible damage
has already occurred. Thus, there is a need for a better biomarker that can detect kidney dysfunction earlier.
Renal metabolic rate of oxygen (MRO2) is a suitable metric that directly represents kidney function. In animal
models MRO2 has been found to increase during the early stages of diabetic kidney disease. Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) oximetric techniques can noninvasively quantify MRO2. A widely used method for quantifying
MRO2 of the brain measures blood water transverse relaxation time T2 in a draining vein and converting the
result via a calibration curve to venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), in addition to a separate scan to acquire blood
flow velocity, which are the key physiological parameters needed to quantify MRO2 via Fick’s principle. The
proposed research introduces a new T2-based oximetry method that overcomes the limitations of prior T2-based
methods by simultaneously measuring SvO2 and blood flow velocity in a single 18-second breath-hold period.
The novel interleaving strategy underlying the proposed technique enables quantification of MRO2 in a single
pass. The hypothesis of the proposed research is that renal MRO2 will serve as a direct, quantitative marker of
early kidney disease before progression to irreversible organ dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, the following
specific aims will be pursued: (1) Optimize the T2-based oximetry pulse sequence and quantify cerebral MRO2
to test its performance against well-established MRI oximetry methods. Initial studies will be performed in the
brain because of minimal physiologic motion and availability of data for comparison. (2): Transfer the method to
the abdomen and quantify renal MRO2 in healthy human subjects and evaluate the method’s precision. (3):
Perform a pilot study to assess renal MRO2 as a marker of early-stage diabetic kidney disease through
quantification of renal MRO2, eGFR, and microalbuminuria in prediabetic and type-2 diabetic patients in
comparison to healthy reference subjects. The method is projected to yield insights into renal metabolism during
the early stages of kidney disease and may eventually provide a means for monitoring patients with diabetic
kidney disease during treatment."
10735895,"Obesity-related asthma is the most consistently reported pediatric non-atopic asthma phenotype that is
associated with high disease burden and is poorly responsive to asthma medications. It is a major subset of
pediatric asthma that is increasing in incidence since 20% of children in the U.S. are overweight/obese, with
higher rates observed in Hispanic and African American children. However, not all children who gain weight
develop obesity-related asthma, suggesting that genetic susceptibility plays a role. Thus, identification of genetic
risk markers for obesity-related asthma will offer opportunities for primary prevention. Investigation of biologic
mechanisms underlying the genetic risk will identify novel therapeutic targets for obesity-related asthma, which
has no effective treatment options. Our research program is leading the investigation of immunobiology of
obesity-related asthma in minority children. In peripheral blood from Hispanic and African American children, we
found non-atopic immune responses with T helper (TH)1 cell polarization that correlated with pulmonary function
deficits in obesity-related asthma, and was associated with upregulation of Cell Division Cycle 42 (CDC42)
pathway in TH cells, which plays an integral role in TH cell migration and differentiation, particularly to TH1 cells;
inhibition of CDC42 led to inhibition of TH1 but not TH2 cytokines. Investigation of the contribution of genetic
variants to immunobiology of obesity-related asthma in minority children identified a single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) at rs6494395 locus that functions as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) in TH
cells for the gene encoding for ribosomal protein S27 like (RPS27L) protein. The minor allele (C allele), that is
2 to 4 times more prevalent in Hispanic and African populations, was associated with RPS27L downregulation.
All three children with C/C genotype were obese with asthma. RPS27L downregulation and homozygosity for C
allele were independent predictors of 14% and 10% (respectively) lower FEV1/FVC ratio in obese children with
asthma. We therefore speculate that the C allele at the rs6494395 locus is relevant to pediatric obesity-related
asthma. Although there is no known links between RPS27L, TH1 cells, CDC42, or asthma, RPS27L is a target
and a modulator of p53, which plays a key role in control of TH cell proliferation and modulates CDC42 to control
cell migration. These findings form the premise for this proposal. We hypothesize that C allele at rs6494395
locus is a novel at-risk allele that confers susceptibility to non-atopic obesity-related asthma in minority children
by downregulating RPS27L which downregulates p53 activity in TH cells, causing increased TH1 cell proliferation
and CDC42-mediated cell migration. To test our hypothesis, we will investigate 1) the ancestry of C allele at
rs6494395, and its links with RPS27L expression, TH1 polarization, and disease burden in obese children with
asthma, relative to obese children without asthma, and healthy-weight children with and without asthma, and 2)
novel mechanistic links between RPS27L, p53, and CDC42 in healthy TH1 cells and the presence of these links
in TH1 cells from obese children with asthma."
10735896,"SUMMARY
 A variety of novel malaria control strategies are being developed to target the parasites within the human or
mosquito vector, or as they transition from vector-to-host or hos-to-vector. Most of these approaches are being
studied and evaluated by using laboratory-based in vitro and rodent models in the context of malaria transmission
dynamics, because to date there is no experimentally easy and affordable human Plasmodium falciparum malaria
transmission model. Furthermore, the small number of in vitro-cultured P. falciparum strains capable of infecting
mosquitoes represent another obstacle in the study of mosquito stages of P. falciparum infection. To maintain
gametocytogenesis and mosquito infectivity, asexually grown P. falciparum cultures should either be maintained
at low passage number or should be passaged through infection cycles in the mosquito vector, but these
strategies also require a malaria transmission model comprising the entire human infection cycle.
 We have recently advanced the development of an existing humanized mouse model to enable the complete
P. falciparum infection cycle, from gametocyte to gametocyte. Here we will further this achievement into a
standardized, affordable and accessible human malaria infection model, thereby closing a critical gap in malaria
transmission studies. In aim 1 we will explore the utility of the humanized mouse-based P. falciparum transmission
model with various malaria vector species and P. falciparum isolates. In aim 2 we will investigate the utility of the
humanized mouse-based P. falciparum transmission model to maintain P. falciparum gametocyte infectiousness
under laboratory conditions."

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 2020, it is estimated that 1.5
million people died from TB. This calls for improved treatment regimens, which will greatly benefit from the
identification of novel strategies to sterilize infections. The overarching idea of this line of research is to subvert
highly adaptive strategies employed by the etiological agent of TB Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). There is a
large body of work in support of Mtb exploiting host fatty acids as a carbon source. However, although important
for growth and survival, fatty acids can also be toxic for Mtb. Previous work from our laboratory showed that
mutants devoid of malate synthase (glcB), type-2 NADH dehydrogenase (ndh/ ndhA) and EtfD (etfD) render a
fatty acid sensitive phenotype associated with attenuation in the mouse model of TB. This showed that it is
possible to turn Mtb’s optimized metabolism to oxidize host fatty acids against the bacilli. Beyond these specific
cases, there is a gap in knowledge on the genetic determinants necessary for Mtb to avoid fatty acid toxicity. To
address this issue, we have performed transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) and compared transposon mutant
libraries generated in medium with and without oleic acid (a long-chain fatty acid commonly used in mycobacteria
culture media, and likely a carbon source during infection). This screening identified ndh and etfD transposon
mutants as being sensitive to oleic acid, which is consistent with our previous findings. In this proposal we will
do a “deep dive” on the physiological function of the top hit of our Tn-seq screening. Preliminary data indicates
that an interplay between cAMP signaling, fatty acid catabolism and respiration impacts Mtb drug susceptibility
and pathogenicity. Understanding how these different cell processes interact will not only lead to a better
understanding of the pathogen’s biology, but it will unveil new strategies to sterilize Mtb infections."

The vision scientist of tomorrow must appreciate fundamental biological processes and the challenges of
ophthalmologists/optometrists to effectively utilize modern tools of research in the pursuit of new knowledge
about diseases of the eye that ultimately lead to the development of adjunct and novel therapeutic
interventions. To facilitate the distribution of knowledge in the field of vision science, the Vision Science
Training Program goals are to continue to provide fundamental and research training to 2 pre-doctoral and 1
postdoctoral fellows. The program is unique in that it includes 21 vision research faculty from two independent
institutions including the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Oklahoma Medical
Research Foundation (OMRF). The participating training faculty are particularly strong in the four
subdisciplines emphasized in the Vision Science Training Program, which include 1) Ocular Immunology and
Infection, 2) Visual Signal Transduction, 3) Cellular Stress and Structure, and 4) Vision Neuroscience and
Genetics. The four subdisciplines have been revised based on the addition of new faculty and areas of vision
research. These faculty preceptors have interacted with one another and with trainees at OUHSC/OMRF for
several years, forming a network that is well-suited to train a cohesive group of pre- and postdoctoral fellows in
visual sciences. The program includes students and fellows from national and international sources, has strong
NIH-funded research programs, and has ample core facilities, all of which foster an atmosphere of excellence
in training. The pre-doctoral students are eligible for the training program after completion of their lab rotations
and qualifying exam in their home departments. The Vision Science Training Program will provide in-depth
enrichment in the 4 subdisciplines to the pre- and postdoctoral trainees through a number of courses, some of
which focus specifically on vision, and professional development and networking opportunities. Postdoctoral
fellows are strongly encouraged to take coursework and to mentor pre-doctoral students to enhance their
training experience. The Visual Science Training Program Advisory Committees select the pre- and
postdoctoral trainees and act in an advisory capacity. The yearly interactive Vision Science workshop, the
Vision Science Journal Club, and courses related to vision science have been effective in bringing pre- and
postdoctoral fellows together with training faculty in an environment that fosters excellence. The first five years
funded 10 pre-doctoral and 5 postdoctoral trainees. During this time, our program trained 14 pre-doctoral and 6
postdoctoral trainees, most of whom have taken the next logical step in their careers in research, academia, or
industry. Continued funding of this training grant will ensure that the community of vision scientists at OUHSC
will be able to provide a robust and motivating environment to prepare trainees for future careers in vision
research."

Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), if considered its own disease type, would rank as the 5th leading cause
of cancer deaths in women in the USA. The main systemic treatment option for these patients in the adjuvant
setting is multi-agent chemotherapy, and now since early 2019, immunotherapy plus chemotherapy is an option
for PDL1-positive metastatic patients. TNBC is also known to be biologically heterogeneous, with multiple
genomically-defined subtypes present. We hypothesize that much of this heterogeneity actually represents
cellular plasticity, and that some TNBC subtypes can actually morph from one subtype into another. We
hypothesize that this plasticity is a key determinant of chemotherapy responsiveness, immune checkpoint
inhibitor sensitivity, and metastatic potential. Furthermore, we hypothesize that if we are able to keep, or promote,
a tumor into the basal-like state, there may be both a change in the immune microenvironment and increased
therapy sensitivity. We will test these hypotheses by using novel combinations of drugs, in vitro screens, and in
vivo testing of metastasis vs primary tumor sensitivity using Genetically Engineered Mouse models and human
tumor specimens."
10791934,"A critical unmet medical need is to understand why some patients diagnosed with hormone receptor (HR+,
estrogen- and progesterone-receptor positive; Her2 negative) breast cancer experience recurrences with distant
metastatic disease whereas others do not, despite similar treatment. This is a significant issue considering that
the majority of patients diagnosed with breast cancer and that experience metastatic relapse have HR+ tumors.
Metastatic spread occurs early, often prior to the detection of the primary mass, and is facilitated by crosstalk
between the tissue and developing tumor. This gives rise to the possibility that differences in the normal tissue
environment exist which enhance the risk for metastatic disease. However, the mechanisms through which
changes arise in the mammary tissue environment and their contributions to metastatic breast cancer remain
largely undefined. We recently established gut commensal dysbiosis, defined as an inflammatory microbiome
with low biodiversity, enhances metastasis of HR+ tumors. Establishing dysbiosis prior to tumor initiation
significantly enhanced dissemination of tumor cells into the blood, distal lymph nodes, and lungs, with no impact
upon primary tumor growth. Dysbiosis enhanced the accumulation of mast cells into the normal mammary tissue
of non-tumor-bearing mice, whereas inhibition of mast cell degranulation significantly reduced metastatic
dissemination. These results indicated an important role for tissue-associated mast cells in the promotion of
breast tumor dissemination. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that blockade of CCL2 prior to tumor initiation is
sufficient to reduce mast cell accumulation in the mammary tissue and to diminish dysbiosis-induced
dissemination of HR+ tumor cells. The goal of this proposal is to define how gut commensal dysbiosis distally
orchestrates cellular and molecular changes in normal mammary tissues of non-tumor-bearing mice that
enhance susceptibility to HR+ tumor dissemination. Aim 1 will define how commensal dysbiosis distally changes
the normal (non-tumor-bearing) mammary tissue immune environment to favor early HR+ tumor dissemination.
We will integrate a variety of approaches to investigate the link between the gut microbiome, host metabolism,
and metastatic breast cancer. Aim 2 will establish how mast cells promote early dissemination of HR+ tumors.
The goal of this aim will be to define how mast cells are activated in mammary tissues of mice with dysbiosis
and establish how mast cells initiate metastasis of HR+ tumors through interactions with tissue fibroblasts and
macrophages. These mechanistic studies will have the potential to unveil novel therapeutic targets for the
prevention of metastatic breast cancer, targets that could be identifiable prior to a tumor diagnosis. Considering
the role of the gut commensal dysbiosis, modification of microbiome or targeting of commensal-associated
metabolites emerges as a potential low cost therapeutic to prevent or reduce the incidence of metastatic breast
cancer."

The Biomimetic Models Core, Core B, based at the University of Delaware (UD), will be responsible for
designing, fabricating, validating, and implementing biomimetic cervicovaginal infection devices in support of all
individual projects and the overall program. Core B will be directed by Dr. Jason Gleghorn. Multiple iterations of
the model (V1-V4) will be developed with increasing levels of complexity based on the needs of the associated
projects. In aim one, a simplified modular 3D multicellular cervical or vaginal culture system will be developed.
This consists of an epithelium cultured on a track-etched membrane with a subepithelial interstitial compartment
consisting of an acellular collagen gel lined with fibroblasts (V1). All models will be inoculated with microbiota,
and cervical mucus will flow on the apical surface of epithelial cells within an anoxic air channel. In aim two, the
individual models will be advanced to incorporate a fibroblast embedded collagen gel interstitial compartment,
and a perfusable vascular compartment lined with endothelial cells (V2). The third aim will include integration of
the two organ models to include a cervicovaginal transition zone in addition to the cellular interstitial and
perfusable vascular compartment (V3). Additionally, we will demonstrate that this system can be created from
matched donor cells and reconstituted extracellular matrix (V4). Finally a concurrent fourth aim is to take these
models, along with their methods of fabrication, and transfer them to project sites for use in Projects 1, 2, and
3. Project 1 focuses on the role of vaginal and cervical microbiota in sexually transmitted infections and will use
this model to study how C. trachomatis infection dynamics are altered in the presence of different types of
microbiota. Project 2 investigates endocrine control of C. trachomatis infection in the context of bacterial
replication, epithelial barrier function, and immune response, and will thus make use of the model’s ability to
model hormonal fluctuations as well as immune cell infiltration. Project 3 examines the influence of the
microbiota on N. gonorrhoeae infection in the context of the immune response and will similarly rely on the
models’ ability to recapitulate microbiota-host interactions and the role of immune cells. The Biomimetic Models
Core will develop models with the projects’ needs in mind and validate them using assays similar to those used
in the projects."
10810851,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To support the goals of the SIM-STI Program, that aims at developing an innovative biomimetic model of the
cervicovaginal environment comprising the microbiota to elucidate how the host-microbiota interactions are
driving host functioning and response to infection by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. To study these
interactions requires technical approaches that describe the system from a broad perspective without prior
knowledge to observe functioning of both the host, the microbiome and the pathogen(s), such as global
transcriptomics (human host RNAseq and bacterial community transcriptomics [metatranscriptomics]),
glycomics and in-depth immune cytokines and chemokines characterizations. Here we propose to apply these
omics approaches to support Project 1, 2 and 3 of the SIM-STI program. Further, transferring our proposed 3D
biomimetic models from the engineering laboratory to three research laboratories for the study of sexually
transmitted infections requires consistent biological resources to insure reproducibility and comparability.
Leveraging the expertise and experience of its PI and infrastructure of the Institute for Genome Sciences at the
University fo Maryland School of Medicine, the Omics/Clinical Core C will support this goal and will assemble
and distribute biological resources (primary cell lines and reconstructed microbiota) using consistent protocols
and qualitative evaluation of the materials to Project 1, 2 and 3, as well as the Biomimetic Models Core B. The
overall goal of the Omics/Clinical Core C is to 1/ apply high-throughput omics approaches to samples provided
by each of the project; 2/ provide microbiological (reconstructed microbiota) and primary cell purchase, isolation
and maintenance services; 3/ perform a clinical study to collect cervicovaginal specimens (swabs, secretion and

10810856,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The risk of sexually transmitted infection (STI) in humans depends on multiple biological factors, among which
the occurrence of a cervicovaginal microbiota that is ‘permissive’ to STI stands out. The microbial composition
of a STI-permissive microbiota is similar to that observed in association with the syndrome of bacterial vaginosis,
a condition that is generally defined by a high pH (>4.5), the absence of Lactobacillus spp. and an array of strict
and facultative anaerobes such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera spp., and Prevotella
spp. In contrast, a typical ‘non-permissive’ microbiota is dominated by one of several species of Lactobacillus, a
unique feature of the human cervicovaginal microbiota. The mechanism(s) by which a non-permissive
cervicovaginal microbiota provides protection against STIs remains poorly understood, as no animal or cell
culture model system developed to date satisfactorily reproduces the cervicovaginal mucosa in its natural
environment as a target for experimental infection. As a consequence, our knowledge of the pathogenesis of
STIs is incomplete, particularly as it pertains to the critical role of the human cervicovaginal microbiota. We have
established extensive preliminary data that support the scientific premise of Project 1 and states that a non-
permissive indigenous microbiota interacts with the cervicovaginal epithelium to establish a homeostatic state
that blocks STI and/or reduces disease severity. Conversely, a permissive microbiota disrupts host cell
homeostasis, thereby allowing STI to progress. Innovative and advanced 3D biomimetic models of the
cervicovaginal mucosa that eliminate the inherent ethical and biological limitations of existing models will be
used to test this hypothesis, using the most prevalent agent of STIs worldwide, Chlamydia trachomatis. Project
1 aims to develop a better understand of the host-microbiota interactions and how they modulate the fate of C.
trachomatis infection. In this project, the biomimetic models will be exploited to ask specific questions about how
different types of microbiota (permissive and non-permissive) modulate epithelial cell functioning (Aim 1) in
relationship to their susceptibility/resistance to chlamydial infection (Aim 2). Project 1 will also assess the
preclinical potential of the model for testing preventive (Aim 2) and therapeutic (Aim 3) interventions against
STIs. For these studies, Project 1 will leverage the full force of an array of state-of-the-art omics methodologies,
including metatranscriptomics and RNA-sequencing to identify and characterize alterations of microbiota and
host cellular homeostasis, metagenomics and metataxonomics to define the composition of carefully
reconstructed microbiota or from human donors on the biomimetic models, and glycomics to analyze mucus
structural features."
10810861,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of sexually transmitted infections of bacterial origin worldwide. No
vaccines are available, infections are often asymptomatic, and if left untreated, long-term sequelae have an
adverse effect on women reproductive health. The primary site of infection is the endocervical epithelium, where
the bacteria replicates in the host cell cytosol within a membrane-bound compartment called the inclusion.
Interventions to prevent the establishment of the Chlamydia replicative niche would reduce vaginal shedding (i.e.
transmission) and ascension to the upper reproductive tract (i.e. long-term pathology). It is more and more
appreciated that the state of the tissue at the time of infection most likely dictates the outcome of infection;
however, little is known about intrinsic and extrinsic factors that collectively prime individual cells within the tissue.
Human epidemiological studies, murine and cell culture models of infection, have been used to gain a better
understanding of these processes; however, there are substantial limitations with these models. To address this
gap, in close collaboration with the Biomimetic Models Core, we will use a human three-dimensional biomimetic
cervicovaginal model of chlamydial infection and investigate the effects of sex hormones on C. trachomatis
infection. We will assess bacterial growth (Aim 1), tissue integrity and physiology (Aim 2) and the immune
response (Aim 3). Altogether, the exposure of ex vivo reconstituted cervicovaginal tissue in its physiological
environment to infectious chlamydiae will offer a unique model system to characterize if and how sex hormones
influence susceptibility to C. trachomatis infection. In the long term, this model will be applicable to the study of
fundamental processes related to any sexually transmitted pathogen and will offer a relatively simple and cost-
effective way for testing novel therapies to control the spread of sexually transmitted infections."
10810867,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes the sexually transmitted infection (STI)
gonorrhea. With an estimated 78 million cases of gonorrhea annually worldwide, increasing frequency of
resistance to all recommended antibiotics, and the lack of a protective vaccine, N. gonorrhoeae is a prominent
and growing threat to human health. In women, N. gonorrhoeae establishes infection at the cervix, where it
initiates an inflammatory response characterized by the local recruitment of neutrophils. Viable N. gonorrhoeae
are recovered from human gonorrheal exudates, indicating that neutrophils cannot effectively clear infection.
The resulting cycle of sustained infection and neutrophilic inflammation enables N. gonorrhoeae transmission as
well as ascending infection and tissue damage, which underlie sequelae such as pelvic inflammatory disease,
ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Moreover, infection with N. gonorrhoeae is highly epidemiologically associated
with coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis, enhancing likelihood of these negative consequences. Identifying
the mechanisms underlying cervical infection and inflammation by these prominent STI pathogens is critical for
finding new therapeutic approaches to enhance women’s overall health and reproductive fitness. Our knowledge
of the bacterial and host conditions that facilitate productive N. gonorrhoeae infection in women is hampered by
the absence of a robust model for human genital infection that incorporates resident and recruited host cells,
maintains the architecture of the lower female genital tract, and incorporates the genital microbiota. To overcome
this knowledge gap, we will use the 3D human primary cervicovaginal biomimetic system developed by our group
to answer fundamental questions about the biology of female genital infection, alone and in the context of
cervicovaginal microbiota that we hypothesize are associated with susceptibility (bacterial vaginosis-associated
anaerobes, community state type-IV) and resistance (Lactobacillus crispatus-dominant, community state type-
I). Aim 1 will define the influence of the microbiota on the progression of cervicovaginal N. gonorrhoeae infection
and effects on epithelial host defenses. Aim 2 will characterize the effect of the microbiota on the cervicovaginal
recruitment of immune cells in response to N. gonorrhoeae. Aim 3 will define how coinfection with N. gonorrhoeae
and C. trachomatis in the context of the microbiota impacts pathogen burden and cervicovaginal immune
response. These studies will include vaginal and endocervical cells from women along with their autologous
microbiota, as well as unmatched microbiota, to evaluate how the host-microbiota interaction influences the
progression and outcome of infections. The findings arising from these studies about the infection process and
ensuing inflammatory response and tissue integrity can reveal new interventions to limit bacterial load and
mucosal epithelial damage, thereby mitigating the negative consequences in women of these common and
debilitating bacterial STIs."

Being naturally occurring and with an intact immune system, spontaneous cancers in pet dogs have the
potential to effectively bridge a current gap between preclinical models and human clinical trials, advancing
cancer immunotherapy. However, a current lack of essential resources creates roadblocks to the effective use
of canine cancers. The deficiency is clearly seen in predicting tumor-specific neoantigen (TSNA), attractive
targets in cancer treatment and prevention. TSNAs arise when intracellular mutant peptides, created by
cancer-associated somatic alterations, are presented by the cell’s histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)
molecules. Hence, MHC-I genotyping is a prerequisite for TSNA prediction. However, with few MHC-I alleles
known to date, MHC-I genotyping for the dog is a significant challenge. Moreover, because of the very limited
MHC-I protein crystal structures and experimental peptide binding data, there currently lack public tools to
predict TSNAs specifically for the dog, in contrast to the human with many tools developed.
With the next generation sequencing (NGS) data published for thousands of dogs from hundreds of breeds,
now is the time to address these deficiencies. We propose to combine our expertise, NGS data analysis by
the Zhao (PI) lab and MHC-I characterization by the Hildebrand (MPI) lab, to develop software tools and data
resources for large scale MHC-I genotyping and systematic TSNA prediction for the dog. We will also
genotype MHC-I alleles of thousands of dogs sequenced and predict TSNAs for hundreds of canine tumors
characterized. We will use our proposed MHC-I genotype and TSNA discovery tools to assist a NCI-funded
immunotherapy trial via collaboration with Dr. Steven Dow, and the Vaccination Against Canine Cancer Study
(VACCS) trial via collaboration with Dr. Douglas Thamm.
By establishing resources that are critically missing at present, our work will significantly enhance the
applicability of the dog model for translational research."
10843768,"ABSTRACT
Effective responses to viruses, intracellular pathogens and tumors rely on the successful expansion and arming of cytolytic CD8 T cells from a naïve and quiescent T cell repertoire. This process, called CD8 T cell priming, is dependent on a specialized antigen-presenting cell known as conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). Recent studies from our lab have shown that a specific type of dendritic cells, called cDC1, is responsible for CD8
T cell priming and depends on the transcription factor Batf3 for development. In the process of priming CD8 T
cells, the cDC1 captures foreign antigens or tumor-specific neo-antigens, and presents these antigens on the
MHC-I molecule in order to stimulate the T cell receptor (TCR) of the CD8 T cell. In the absence of cDC1, such
as in Batf3-deficient mice, CD8 T cells are not activated against viruses or tumors. In addition, however, full
activation of CD8 T cell requires that cDC1 receive signals that program its ability to fully activate CD8 T cells.
This process is called `DC licensing', but is currently not fully characterized. Our recent work has shown that
current models for DC licensing are incomplete. Specifically, while we have confirmed the requirement for
CD40 signaling in response to CD40L provided by a helper cell, we have shown that the expected target of
CD40, CD70, does not explain the beneficial effect of DC licensing for tumor rejection. This result implies that
additional targets of CD40 are needed to understand DC licensing. Further, it has been thought that CD4 T
cells are the exclusive agent in the licensing process. However, these conclusions derived from older studies
and less precise methods. In contrast, we developed an Xcr1-Cre deletor strain to delete genes specifically
from cDC1, and found unexpected results, that CD4 T cells are not always critical for cDC1 licensing, suggesting that other cells expressing CD40L may be involved. Further, mechanism by which CD40 signaling induces
licensing of the cDC1 is unclear. Several mechanisms have been proposed, but our preliminary data excludes
the major proposed mechanism, those invoking CD70, as being critical for the effect of licensed cDC1 in priming CD8 T cells. Our proposal will first test (Aim 1) which Batf3-specific genes expressed in cDC1 are important
for cDC1 to support CD8 T cells responses. Second (Aim 2), we will determine identify the targets of CD40
signaling in cDC1 that are required for fully activating CD8 T cells. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the role of cells
that we have identified as alternative sources of CD40 ligand, including iNKT cells and γδ T cells."
10834087,"ABSTRACT
Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a degenerative disorder of the neuromuscular system caused by
a CAG/glutamine tract expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. The polyglutamine AR (polyQ AR)
undergoes hormone-dependent nuclear translocation and unfolding, steps that are essential to toxicity and to
the development of progressive muscle weakness in men. Although it was long considered that lower motor
neurons are the primary targets of degeneration in SBMA, recent studies from our laboratory and others have
established the importance of peripheral polyQ AR expression in disease. This work highlights a central
contribution of polyQ AR expression in skeletal muscle to weakness and atrophy. Based on these findings, we
have developed an innovative model of SBMA pathogenesis in which degeneration of the neuromuscular system
begins with toxic effects in skeletal muscle and progresses over time to involve spinal motor neuron
degeneration. Here, we propose to test this model of disease pathogenesis in gene targeted mice (AR113Q
mice) expressing polyQ AR at endogenous levels and in appropriate cell types. The objective of this application
is to experimentally test our novel model of disease pathogenesis. This model forms our central hypothesis and
is supported by a rigorous foundation of published and preliminary data. Here, we will use two complementary
approaches to test our central hypothesis: First, we will use antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to knock-down
expression of polyQ AR selectively in peripheral tissues or CNS of symptomatic AR113Q mice and determine
effects on late onset motor neuron degeneration. Second, we will restore function of a critical transcriptional
regulator in skeletal muscle that contributes to SBMA skeletal muscle atrophy and then determine the extent to
which this influences the AR113Q phenotype, including motor neuron degeneration. These aims will be
complemented by studies designed to leverage the endogenous cellular machinery that regulates polyQ AR
degradation in order to eliminate proteotoxicity in disease relevant human cells. We will use biochemical, genetic,
and histological assays to establish beneficial effects of AR targeted ASOs administered to symptomatic
AR113Q mice (Aim 1), determine the extent to which increased MEF2 function rescues the AR113Q phenotype
(Aim 2), and establish effects of targeting the Hsp90/Hsp70 chaperone machinery in SBMA models (Aim 3).
These studies are expected to experimentally test our proposed model of disease pathogenesis and provide a
strong foundation for developing targeted therapies to treat SBMA patients."
10904791,"Proprioception is critical for effective motor control: dysfunctions of the proprioceptive system can impair
balance, motor coordination, and motor learning. However, despite its importance, little is known about the initial
stages of proprioceptive processing in any animal, nor how this information is modulated by behavioral state. I
propose studying proprioception in the fly, D. melanogaster, whose proprioceptive system is more experimentally
accessible than that of vertebrates, but still analogous in its organization and function. I will combine experimental
and computational methods to study the flow of information from the proprioceptive sensory structure, the
femoral chordotonal organ, into genetically identifiable downstream circuits. In particular, I will characterize how
neural encoding changes during self vs. externally-generated movements, and how proprioceptive information
enters the brain to inform motor planning.
 Test how perturbing specific inputs changes central encoding of imposed tibia movements. I will use patch-
clamp electrophysiology to record the activity of second-order proprioceptive neurons while moving the leg along
naturalistic and broadband, pseudo-random trajectories. I will then build a linear/nonlinear model to determine
the computations performed by each cell type. I will perturb inputs to central neurons and determine how these
perturbations alter neural encoding of leg movements.
 Test the hypothesis that self- vs. externally-generated motions are differently encoded by some neurons. I
will record the activity of second-order neurons while the fly moves its leg. I will then replay those movements
and determine which neurons differently encode self- vs. externally-generated movements. I will characterize
how a neuron’s encoding changes and determine if there is an internal estimate of state expectations.
 Determine how proprioceptive information entering the brain integrates with behavioral state and information
from other mechanoreceptors. Preliminary anatomical data suggests that a region of the brain, the wedge,
integrates multimodal mechanosensory cues from the legs and antennae. I will use 2-photon calcium imaging to
determine what proprioceptive information is relayed to this area and whether leg movement attenuates antennal
signals. I will then focus on how the central complex, a brain region important in motor planning, receives
proprioceptive input. I will use intracellular recordings and calcium imaging to ask which central complex neurons
encode proprioceptive information.
 My long-term goal is to run my own research group focused on the function and evolution of the fly
proprioceptive system. Toward this end, my postdoctoral training is focused on the following goals: honing my
computational skills, developing management and mentoring skills, publishing and presenting my research, and
securing an independent, tenure-track position. I will be co-mentored by Drs. John Tuthill and Adrienne Fairhall
in the Physiology and Biophysics department at the University of Washington."
10695970,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only cause of death among the top ten that cannot be prevented, cured,
or even slowed, making it urgent to identify novel therapeutic targets for treatment of AD. It is generally accepted
that toxic amyloid β (Aβ) peptides are the key pathogenic factor for AD. However, AD progression and clinical
presentation are highly heterogeneous and determined by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Therefore,
in order to develop effective disease-modifying therapies, it is necessary to fully understand the action of Aβ and
identify underlying mechanisms that modulate its effects on cognitive functions. Our unpublished data revealed
that Aβ42 oligomers (the major toxic species of Aβ peptides) act as allosteric modulators with nanomolar affinity
for the α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2AAR). This is the first example in which Aβ functions as an allosteric modulator
of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with nanomolar affinity. We found that Aβ42 binding to α2AAR resulted
in aberrant coupling of α2AAR to activation of a new signaling effector that promotes neuronal dysfunction and
cognitive impairment. The Aβ-dependent pathological coupling of α2AAR signaling provides a novel mechanism
underlying Aβ-induced toxicity to brain function, and suggests that the Aβ-α2AAR interaction represents a
potential disease-specific target for AD treatment. The primary objective of this proposal is to address the cellular
and molecular mechanisms and in vivo relevance of the Aβ-α2AAR interaction in exacerbating AD-related
neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment using combined cellular, molecular and genetic approaches. We
will first determine the cellular aspect of detrimental effects induced by the Aβ-α2AAR interaction in neurons.
Second, we will identify the molecular mechanism critical for Aβ-dependent pathological coupling of α2AAR
signaling and determine the role of G proteins and βarrestins in this process. Third, we will determine the in vivo
functional relevance of the Aβ-α2AAR interaction in exacerbating AD-related cognitive deficits. Successfully
accomplishing this study will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying Aβ actions in disrupting cognitive function in AD. Targeting the disease-specific interaction between
Aβ oligomers and α2AAR represents a potential safe and effective approach to improve cognitive function in AD."
10881709,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a U.S. incidence rate of almost 150,000 cases per year, encompassing over 10%
of new cancer diagnoses. In 2016, within the Veterans Administration Healthcare System alone, 3,400 new
patients were diagnosed with CRC, including 614 with advanced disease and very limited treatment options.
Understanding the basic biology of the underlying malignant transformation is the key to identifying new
therapeutic targets and intervention strategies. Epithelial junctional dysfunction is common in CRC. In early
iterations of this research plan, we discovered that BVES, a tight junction-associated protein, was
underexpressed via extensive promoter hypermethylation in colonic tumors, even at the earliest adenoma stage.
We and others have further demonstrated that restoring BVES expression attenuated pro-tumorigenic
phenotypes in a variety of cancer cell lines. In the prior funding period, we determined that BVES-deficient mice
had increased tumor burden and more severe dysplasia in both genetic and chemical tumor models. Collectively,
these data suggested that BVES functions as a tumor suppressor in epithelial malignancy; thus, BVES may
represent a new diagnostic marker and/or therapeutic target in cancer. Mechanistically, we are beginning to
understand that BVES functions as a scaffolding protein, orchestrating protein complex formation to facilitate
outside ® in signal transduction to coordinately regulate intracellular signaling pathways to alter cellular
phenotypes in response to microenvironmental cues. For example, we discovered that BVES interacts with
PR61a:PP2A to reduce cellular c-Myc levels and attenuate WNT signaling by restricting LRP6 levels. Recently,
BVES was discovered to modulate cAMP signaling in the heart. We determined that BVES interacts with
AKAP11, a cAMP/PKA nanodomain partitioning protein, and that BVES loss was associated with reduced PKA
activity as evidenced by reduced phosphorylated CREB. Thus, BVES likely regulates another signaling pathway
highly relevant to tumor biology. Lastly, we have established a bank of Stage II and III human CRC 3D cultures
and developed techniques to genetically modify and orthotopically xenograft them. This will serve as a platform
for testing whether BVES can modify the growth of established CRC and determining the relative contributions
of BVES-regulated signaling. In this proposal, we structure three Specific Aims designed to understand the role
of BVES in tumor biology. First, we will further our understanding of the BVES:AKAP11:PKA axis. In the second
aim, we will determine the functional impact of restoring BVES in early tumor biology (adenomas) ex vivo. In the
last aim, we will test the hypothesis that restoring BVES can attenuate the growth of human CRC and test
whether this restoring BVES sensitizes CRC to chemotherapeutic and targeted therapies in 3D culture and
murine models. Through these studies, we will gain fundamental insights into how BVES loss contributes
to malignant progression and extend our knowledge of how tumor-relevant pathways are regulated,
informing development of new diagnostics and therapeutics."
10871816,"Mutational activation of RAS occurs in approximately 30% of human tumors with some cancers such as
pancreatic cancer having RAS mutations in >90% of tumors. Although mutational activation of RAS shifts RAS
to the GTP-bound state, a number of oncogenic RAS proteins are characterized by high intrinsic nucleotide
dissociation rates. Thus, these RAS mutants, termed “fast-exchange” mutants, transiently release GTP and
transit through the nucleotide-free (apo) state. Following on our previous MERIT award that resulted in
development of high affinity tool biologics (Monobodies) that specifically and selectively bind apoRAS, we have
made a paradigm shifting discovery that these apo-specific Monobodies function as potent inhibitors of fast-
exchange, oncogenic RAS mutants. Preliminary studies suggest that these Monobodies inhibit both the
signaling and oncogenic activity of fast exchange but not slow exchange RAS mutants. Using these powerful
tool biologics, we will: 1. determine the selectivity of these apoRAS Monobodies toward various RAS mutants
and RAS family members; 2. assess the viability and selectivity of targeting apoRAS as a strategy to inhibit
RAS-mediated signaling and oncogenic transformation in vitro; 3. determine the efficacy of targeting apoRAS
in vivo as a therapeutic strategy for treating RAS-mutant pancreatic cancers; and 4. develop our apoRAS-
specific Monobodies into a preclinical anti-RAS therapeutic. Given the prevalence of RAS mutations in human
cancers and the importance of RAS in driving cancer development and progression, particularly pancreatic
cancers, it is critical to develop new approaches to therapeutically inhibit RAS in patients. Although decades of
research in the RAS field has resulted in a dearth of FDA-approved pharmacological inhibitors, recent
pioneering work has renewed hope in finally developing an anti-RAS therapeutic. Several companies have
launched clinical trials of drugs that specifically target the RAS(G12C) mutant protein based on the thiol
reactivity of the G12C mutation. Although initial results are promising, these inhibitors will only be useful in
G12C-mutant tumors which constitute roughly15% of all RAS-mutant cancers and less than 2% of pancreatic
tumors. Our findings, however, would be applicable to more than >50% of RAS mutant cancers including more
than 45% of RAS-mutant pancreatic cancers. Thus, our proposed studies in this MERIT renewal will provide
critical insights into a novel approach to inhibit RAS-mediated tumorigenesis and are thus likely to have broad
translation significance. More importantly, this work will be beneficial to Veterans as well as the general
population, both of which suffer from cancer. However, the incidence for RAS mutant cancers, such as lung
and pancreatic cancer, has been reported to be up to 5-7x higher in Veteran populations making these studies
particularly relevant to the health of our Veterans."
10840893,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION / ABSTRACT
 Declines in muscle quality and impaired metabolism are major contributing factors to cardiovascular
disease morbidity and mortality. Loss of lean body mass and muscle vitality not only impairs mobility, but also
contributes to worsening of a large range of systemic disease outcomes. Environmental exposure to arsenic
is strongly associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disease in millions of individuals globally. However,
the underlying pathogenic mechanisms for these increased risks are relatively unknown. The proposed
studies seek to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the hypothesis that arsenic impairs muscle progenitor
cell function and differentiation to promote declines in muscle quality and composition, as well as disrupt
communication of healthy muscle metabolism with systemic organs. We find that low to moderate
environmental exposure to arsenic in drinking water promotes skeletal muscle decline by disrupting muscle
composition and structure, as well as injuring mitochondria and altering mitochondrial bioenergetics. In
addition, we find fibroadipogenic remodeling of the muscle that resembles myosteatosis, a major risk factor
for cardiovascular mortality and type 2 diabetes in humans. Mechanistically, stem cell mitochondria targeted
by arsenic promote epigenetic induction of pathogenic progenitor cell phenotypes and differentiation. It is
important to resolve the mechanisms for dysfunctional mitochondrial and nuclear epigenetic communication
in order to identify strategies that restore normal muscle metabolism. Towards this goal, the studies in
specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that dysfunctional mitochondrial communication drives pathogenic
metabolic and phenotypic changes in progenitor cells and their niche that dictate muscle maintenance and
adiposity. Importantly, we will use a mitochondrial protective peptide to determine whether reversing the
mitochondrial effects of arsenic restores normal epigenetic regulation, stem cell phenotypes, and muscle
metabolism. The goal of the studies in specific Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that maladaptive mitochondrial
phenotypes drive pathogenic paracrine and systemic communication. These studies focus on dysfunctional
paracrine and systemic signaling mediated by miRNA cargo in extracellular vesicles released from arsenic-
exposed muscle progenitor cells and skeletal muscles. We will identify the effects of arsenic on the profile of
miRNA cargo and determine whether this altered profile affects metabolism in systemic organs, such as the
liver. As in Aim 1, we will intervene with mitochondrial protective agents to determine whether the miRNA
cargo profiles and organ metabolism can be restored to normal. If successful, these studies will identify
clinically-relevant and immediately-tractable strategies to reverse pathogenic muscle maintenance and loss of
regenerative capacity from chronic arsenic exposures. The greater impact will be the identification of
strategies to reduce the contribution of arsenic to the global burden of metabolic and cardiovascular
diseases, an ever-increasing concern in aging populations."
10839349,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating stress-related mental disorder that disproportionately
impacts African Americans (AAs). Our earlier work identified key social adversity factors, including loneliness,
perceived discrimination, cumulative trauma, emotional maltreatment and financial difficulties that, in combination
with DNA methylation in glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network genes, prospectively predicted PTSD
symptom severity. While studies examining the risk of PTSD among white and AA populations have shown that
AAs are at a higher risk of PTSD following traumatic exposure, there are few studies that have specifically
examined the socioenvironmental factors that lead to differential risk within AA populations. Within-population
studies have the potential to uncover exposures that ultimately lead to race/ethnic disparities in PTSD risk.
Indeed, structural, psychosocial and environmental mechanisms, such as living in unsafe environments and
exposure to discrimination, may contribute to differential PTSD risk in AAs. Our prior research confirms these
findings. What remains unknown, however, are: (i) the potential buffering effects of positive social exposures,
such as social support and cohesion, which have been shown to play an important role in mitigating risk of PTSD;
and (ii) the extent to which peripheral epigenetic measures are relevant to the target organ of PTSD—the brain.
Advances in the science of linking peripheral epigenomic variation to central nervous system (CNS) epigenomic
variation (herein called brain-related epigenomic variation) is urgently needed in order to gain deeper mechanistic
insight into PTSD-related health disparities among AAs affected by this mental health condition. Therefore, the
overall goal of this renewal application is to provide mechanistic insight into how social context, both positive and
negative, affects brain-related epigenomic variation to impact risk of PTSD and traumatic stress in a prospective,
community-based cohort of AAs. To achieve this goal, we will leverage publicly available, multi-tissue datasets to
identify epigenomic markers that are highly correlated in brain and blood, and focus our proposed analyses on
these correlated measures using existing and newly collected epigenomic and gene expression data from the
Detroit Neighborhood Health Study (DNHS) cohort. The genomic data will be paired with DNHS survey data,
which includes annual measures of social adversity, psychopathology, and social support and cohesion. We will
focus analyses on social adversities previously implicated in our earlier work (loneliness, perceived
discrimination, cumulative trauma, financial difficulties, emotional mistreatment) and positive social exposures
previously implicated in PTSD (social support and neighborhood social cohesion). Results from this study will
provide a deeper characterization of how social exposures, both positive and negative, influence brain-related
epigenomic processes to impact stress-related psychopathology among AAs, an under-studied U.S. minority
group with substantial health disparities in traumatic-stress related psychopathology."

Cardiac valves are critical to the maintenance of unidirectional blood flow in the heart. Congenital and acquired
valvulopathies are a major source of morbidity and mortality in both the pediatric and adult populations. Current
therapeutic strategies are limited, often requiring surgical replacement with suboptimal prostheses.
Valvulogenesis begins with formation of the endocardial cushions via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT). Many of the signaling pathways regulating this EMT event have been defined; however, little is known
about the molecular regulators of post-EMT valvulogenesis. Ebstein’s Anomaly, a rare congenital heart defect,
is characterized by variably dysplastic, muscularized tricuspid valve leaflets that are often tethered to the
underlying myocardium, resulting in apical displacement of the annulus and atrialization of the right ventricle.
This defect is often attributed to a failure of valvular delamination – a critical morphogenetic step of post-EMT
valvulogenesis during which the primordial valve leaflets separate from the underlying myocardium. Previous
studies suggest that altered differentiation dynamics of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) may contribute to the
pathogenesis of this valvular defect. I propose to define the molecular regulators of valvular delamination
via a multi-omic dissection of Ebstein’s Anomaly, leveraging an Ebstein’s Anomaly murine model system,
primary human tissue, and human genetics data. In my first aim, I will use spatiotemporal single cell RNA
sequencing and human genetics analyses to identify the atrioventricular cushion signaling interactions regulating
valvular delamination. In my second aim, I will use an integrated single cell RNA/ATAC sequencing approach to
define the gene regulatory networks driving VIC fate determination. My primary sponsor, Dr. Deepak Srivastava,
has extensive expertise in developmental cardiac biology, human genetics, and stem cell biology. My co-
sponsor, Dr. Chun (Jimmie) Ye, has an expertise in experimental and computational single cell genomics. Their
collective expertise will assure that I receive the necessary training and mentorship to complete the proposed
research. To obtain the rare tissue samples required for my project, I have formed a multi-center collaboration
with two high volume Ebstein’s Anomaly patient centers. Additionally, I have secured expertise in human
genetics and machine learning from Dr. Jingjing Li, Ph.D., in support of the human genetics component of my
project. Concurrently, I am engaging in a longitudinal clinical preceptorship in pediatric cardiothoracic surgery
with my clinical training co-sponsor, Dr. Peter Kouretas, Surgical Director of the UCSF Pediatric Heart
Transplantation Program. Overall, the proposed research will elucidate previously uncharacterized mechanisms
of late atrioventricular valvular morphogenesis and inform future efforts toward the development of novel
regenerative-medicine based therapeutics for congenital and acquired valvulopathies. F30 NRSA fellowship
support would foster my expertise in developmental cardiac biology and computational genomics, furthering me
toward my ultimate career goal of becoming an academic pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon-scientist."
10813719,"ABSTRACT
 Nearly half of hospitalized older adults are unable to make their own medical decisions and require a
family member or other surrogate to make decisions for them. Many surrogates make decisions about life and
death issues under conditions of high stress and often with poor support from clinicians. Surrogates rely on
various sources of emotional support and sources of value to make medical decisions, including personal,
religious and spiritual beliefs. However, both surrogates and clinicians report high levels of distress due to the
emotional and communication challenges of making decisions for others. As the population ages and a greater
number of older adults are at risk for cognitive impairment, the importance of surrogate decision making will
only increase. The COVID-19 pandemic has added greater urgency due to the many cognitively impaired
patients separated from their families during life threatening illness and hospitalization. Developing
interventions to promote high quality decision making will allow us to best support family members and to
provide the best possible care to older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders.
 Dr. Alexia Torke’s research has focused on the communication, ethical, religious and spiritual aspects
of decision making for those patients who are incapacitated and require a family surrogate to make decisions
for them. During her current period of funding from her K24 Midcareer Award in Patient Oriented Research,
she achieved the research goals proposed in the award, obtained an R01 grant as PI, and mentored several
successful junior faculty. This K24 renewal will continue to provide support for Dr. Torke’s program of research
and will allow her additional protected time to pursue her passion for mentoring others.
 The specific aims of this proposal are to develop the national network for a multicenter trial of spiritual

10854722,"SUMMARY: Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the blood vessel wall play pivotal roles in cardiovascular
disease (CVD; e.g., hypertension), which affects ~48% of US adults, and which is significantly accelerated by
diabetes (DCVD). When stimulated by factors like diabetes and the growth factor Angiotensin II (AngII), mature
VSMCs de-differentiate through “phenotypic switching” (Phe-sw) via dysregulation of ""contractile"" and ""synthetic”
genes, resulting in increased VSMC proliferation, migration, inflammation, and extracellular matrix (ECM)
production. In the previous funding cycles, we unraveled the first functional roles for AngII-regulated long
noncoding RNAs and (super-)enhancers (a key epigenetic regulatory layer) in VSMCs. Our overall objective in
this renewal is to elucidate the mechanisms regulating diabetes- and AngII-induced VSMC Phe-sw at the
epigenome and single-cell (sc) level and how these mechanisms establish vascular metabolic memory (in which
prior hyperglycemia/AngII exposure leads to persistent long-term DCVD despite subsequent glucose
normalization). We will use state-of-the-art multi-omics and sc-sequencing (seq) approaches to decipher VSMC
behavior in DCVD and metabolic memory and identify new drug targets. Our hypothesis is that diabetic
conditions and AngII coordinately re-program the VSMC transcriptome and epigenome, which lead to persistent
dysregulation of genes promoting Phe-sw to unique cellular states underlying VSMC dysfunction and accelerated
DCVD. This hypothesis is supported by extensive new preliminary data that show: i) a diabetic state augments
AngII actions and promotes VSMC proliferation and Phe-sw gene profiles, which persist even after glucose
normalization; ii) DNA methylation is decreased, and chromatin accessibility is increased at key upregulated
ECM and inflammatory genes in VSMCs from diabetic mice, even after culture in normal glucose; iii) new cell
clusters indicative of Phe-sw occur in aortas of Ang II-infused mice, identified using integrated scRNA- and
scATAC-seq; iv) diabetic stimuli induce 3D chromatin changes in vascular cells, seen using chromatin
conformation assays. We will test our hypothesis in 3 specific aims: 1) Define diabetes-induced transcriptomic
and epigenomic changes [AngII-(in)dependent] in VSMCs at Phe-sw-related genes, and the memory of their
persistent dysregulation after glucose normalization in vitro; 2) Elucidate the de-differentiated VSMC subtypes
and their functions in diabetes- and AngII-induced Phe-sw in arteries, and their persistence after glucose
normalization in vivo, using scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq; and 3) Determine the translational potential for
reversing DCVD and vascular memory by targeting candidate genes/loci mediating diabetes- and AngII-induced
VSMC Phe-sw. This innovative study, using cutting-edge technologies and functional in vivo models, will provide
novel insights into VSMC regulatory networks and epigenetic memory of diabetic vasculopathy. This knowledge
has the potential to inform development of much-needed new therapies, especially for patients not responding
well to currently available diabetes drugs and AngII blockers, with far-reaching clinical implications for DCVD."

In response to PAR-20-080, NIMH Mentoring Networks for Mental Health Research Education, this application
seeks five years of support to respond to training demand, continue scientific leadership to the field, and
empower a new generation of leaders in implementation science for mental health services research. This
network will extend in creative new ways the Implementation Research Institute (IRI, NIMH R25 funding 2009-
2015, 2016-2019), which has successfully trained 87 new mental health implementation researchers.
Implementation science is critical for mental health where most Americans with mental disorder receive sub-
optimal care due in large part to challenges in the implementation, sustainability, and scale-up of evidence-
treatments. Training demand far outweighs supply but only a handful of programs train implementation
researchers and only the IRI in mental health. Therefore we seek a five-year renewal of IRI to pursue three
aims: (1) to continue a vibrant mentoring network of Faculty and Fellows who will advance the science and
lead the workforce in mental health implementation research; (2) to accelerate training benefits and enhance
IRI sustainment by elevating new mentoring leadership in implementation science, and (3) to evaluate training
outcomes. We will achieve aim 1 by (a) conducting an innovative, continually renewed annual summer
institute; (b) fostering networked collaboration and mentoring from faculty to fellow and peer to peer among IRI
fellows; (c) supporting fellows’ travel to externally funded implementation research sites where they will learn
from NIH Principal Investigators, thereby expanding their networks; and (d) equipping IRI fellows, via the
Translational Science Benefit Model (TSBM), to map pathways for the public health impact of the MHSR
implementation science in response to aim four of NIMH’s strategic plan. We will achieve aim 2 by using
evidence-based mentoring and leadership development strategies to train an Associate Director designee and
new core faculty designees, pairing them with seasoned core faculty and advancing them to mentoring
leadership positions in implementation science. We will achieve aim 3 by using evaluation methods that
include TSBM case studies, bibliometrics, social network analysis, and competency assessment to evaluate
outcomes that include mentoring effectiveness, collaboration, translational benefits, and implementation
science to scholarly products."
10854766,"Tear microbicidal activity protects the surface of the eye from environmental pathogens and may regulate levels
of commensal bacteria. Lacritin, a prosecretory mitogen enriched in human basal and reflex tears, is subject to
cleavage-potentiated release of C-terminal proteoforms, including those bactericidal for E. coli, P. aeruginosa
(Migula and PA14), L. monoctyogenes, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Removal of C-terminal proteoforms from
human tears by repeated passage over anti-lacritin C- (but not N-) terminal antibody columns depletes all tear
antimicrobial activity, an activity encapsulated in the synthetic peptide AQKLLKKFSLLKPWA 'N-104', also a
proteoform. As a cationic, largely a-helical amphipathic peptide, death by membrane disruption would be
expected - a hypothesis largely ruled out by surface plasmon resonance with model bacterial membranes, and
metabolomic analysis with parent 'N-65' fragment that suggests a regulated cell death mechanism. Very
revealing were screens for N-104 resistant mutants out of the full E. coli Keio collection of 3,985 nonessential
gene knockouts. Knockout of feoB, potH, ybaE, yhfZ or ybdM was sufficient to confer resistance, but not to
equimolar amounts of ampicillin. The same is true for feoB and potH transposon insertion mutants of
opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa PA14. YbaE and YbdM are uncharacterized in E. coli and P. aeruginosa
where functions may differ. YhfZ is absent from P. aeruginosa. FeoB is a well-known virulence factor of
respiratory P. aeruginosa, F. tularensis and L. pneumophila, gut C. jejuni and H. pylori, and uropathogenic E.
coli, but has not previously been associated with ocular infections. FeoB and PotH contribute to or form
respective ferrous iron and putrescine and uptake channels, YbaE (with proposed name 'bacterial extracellular
solute-binding protein') appears to be an ABC transporter subunit with a genetic interaction to outer membrane
protein A, and YbdM is a ParB domain containing nuclease. Ferrous iron and putrescine are each essential for
bacterial cell growth, and yet are also required by host cells, especially the avascular cornea. Media
supplementation with a 10-fold molar excess of putrescine, but not fellow polyamine spermidine, completely
abrogates N-104 dependent bacterial death (tear putrescine is 1/10th that of N-104 proteoform).
Complementation of potH- E. coli by potH+ cDNA does the opposite. Prior metabolomic studies (that did not
detect ferrous iron) revealed that N-104 parent 'N-65' rapidly suppresses intracellular E. coli putrescine. Our
immediate focus is on FeoB and PotH. Our working hypothesis is that FeoB and/or PotH are virulence
mechanisms for ocular surface pathogens with N-104 a main source of tear bactericidal activity. Our immediate
goal is to elucidate how N-104, through FeoB or PotH triggers killing.

10886494,"A major complication of mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSD) for multi-organ
support is the dichotomous pathology of thrombosis and bleeding. Intravascular
hemolysis associated with MCSD produces free hemoglobin (fHb). Adsorption of
fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (VWF) onto non-biological surfaces captures
platelets that may aggregate. We reported that high levels of fHb increased VWF-
mediated platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on fibrin(ogen)-coated surfaces at
high shear stress. Importantly, fHb increased the flow-dependent adhesion of formalin
fixed platelets to a VWF coated surface, suggesting that fHb directly enhances the VWF-
glycoprotein (GP)Ib interaction. VWF deficiency or antibodies against GPIb block the
enhancement of platelet adhesion by fHb, validating the role of VWF. Lastly, our
identification of ultra large VWF (ULVWF) in whole blood exposed to fHb and high shear
rates suggests that platelet derived ULVWF may contribute to the pathology of thrombosis
in the presence of high levels of fHb. Together, these findings provide the first evidence
that high levels of fHb are critical for VWF-mediated thrombosis on surfaces coated with
fibrin(ogen), and that ULVWF multimers from shear-activated platelets may enhance
thrombosis more robustly than plasma VWF in the presence of fHb. Our overarching
hypothesis is that fHb targets VWF, including the platelet-derived VWF, to promote
platelet adhesion via GPIb, and potentiate fibrin formation by facilitating the binding of
VWF to fibrinogen. We propose molecular, biochemical, and structural studies to
investigate the mechanisms by which fHb dysregulates the interactions between VWF,
fibrin(ogen), and platelets. Aim 1 will investigate the contributions of platelet VWF vs.
plasma VWF to thrombosis. We will test the hypotheses that fHb interaction with platelet
VWF enhances platelet adhesion to fibrin(ogen) and potentiates fibrin formation more
robustly than plasma VWF. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that fHb-bound VWF has a
conformation that favors platelet adhesion. Aim 3 will determine the mechanism by which
fHb dysregulate VWF-fibrin(ogen) interaction. We will test the hypotheses that fHb
promotes VWF-fibrin(ogen) association and modulates the VWF-mediated fibrin
formation. These studies will describe new mechanisms related to thrombosis in patients
on MCSD and identify new, potential targets for therapeutic interventions in fHb-induced
thrombosis."
10762466,"Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii cause life threatening cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, the most
common fungal infection of the central nervous system in the world today. The 12-month mortality rate for
individuals with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is 60% even with the current antifungal treatment.
Developing vaccines against cryptococcosis to treat high risk patients remains one of the most urgent and
challenging goals to combat this devastating fungal infection. So far, inactivated whole cell vaccines and
recombinant protein subunit vaccines are being investigated in preclinical studies. Both inactivated whole cell
vaccines or protein subunit vaccines have issues (e.g., safety, technical, cost, and efficacy concerns) and none
have made it to clinical trials yet.
 The emerging and clinically proven vaccine technology based on delivering stabilized mRNAs encoding
immunogens packaged in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has not been developed for any bacterial or fungal
infections. Here we will investigate this technology to develop vaccines against cryptococcal infections. Our
research group has experience with liposomes and nucleic acids, and have been working with together on
dectin-decorated liposomes for targeted antifungal drug delivery for years. The targeted antifungal delivery with
dectin-decorated liposomes has shown great promise in both in vitro and animal models. We have also
experience with vaccination against Cryptococcus infection using inactivated cryptococcal mutants.
Capitalizing on these experiences, our goal is to produce a highly effective mRNA LNP vaccine for
cryptococcosis. We have incorporated several new strategies into our novel mRNA vaccine design. For
example, encoded immunogens to be tested are selected based on prior demonstrated efficacy of recombinant
proteins to be protective immunogens, high in vivo transcript abundance, extracellular localization, and their
roles in fungal pathogenesis. Because each extracellular protein will be produced from an mRNA in the host
cell, it will be glycated, and hence, more closely resemble proteins produced by the fungus C. neoformans as
compared to recombinant proteins produced by E. coli. To meet our goal, we propose to accomplish the
following two specific aims: (i) Construct LNPs carrying the mRNAs encoding distinct candidate C. neoformans
protein immunogens. (ii) Test the immunogenicity and durable host protection provided by each mRNA
nanoparticle vaccine and a combinatorial vaccine in mouse models of cryptococcosis. Completion of this
proposal will likely provide a successful platform for mRNA vaccine against cryptococcosis and in the future
other fungal diseases. The exploratory nature of the proposed work and the potential impact it could have on
our ability to fight this and other deadly fungal pathogens make this application perfectly fit for the R21
mechanism."
10834144,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the United
States; and the risks for disease are greatest among older adults. For more than half a century, CVD risk
calculators have been used to estimate a person’s risk of developing CVD and to guide treatment strategies to
prevent disease. Unfortunately, the tool recommended by current guidelines performs poorly in older adults and
among dis/advantaged population groups. The proposed reasons for these shortcomings are twofold. First, the
existing model does not account for changes in risk factors—e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure (BP), etc.—that
occur with age-related declines in vascular function and/or the use of preventive therapies. Second, the existing
model does not account for social determinants of health (SDOH) and other non-clinical factors that have been
shown to improve risk prediction across diverse population groups. Without addressing these issues, a vital
tool for CVD prevention will remain suboptimal and opportunities to reduce the development of CVD in adults
who are at greatest risk of disease will remain urgent and unmet. Our central hypothesis is that CVD risk
prediction and its translation to disease prevention can be greatly improved in older adults by synchronizing
age-related changes among multiple established risk factors while accounting for SDOH and other factors that
contribute to CVD risks. Using nationally-representative data (Health and Retirement Study [HRS]) and pooled
community-based cohorts (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities [ARIC], Cardiovascular Health Study [CHS],
Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis [MESA], Framingham [FHS] Original, and FHS Offspring), our aims are
threefold: First, we will use group-based trajectory models to classify age-related changes within and among
the major risk factors for CVD in a nationally-representative sample of older adults (65+). Results will then be
validated with external (pooled cohort) data to identify the most efficient and robust classifications of age-related
changes among the multiple established risk factors. Second, we will predict the onset of CVD based on the
multi-trajectory profiles of risk factors. By accounting for changes in risk factors and trajectory group-membership
with advancing age, this approach will mirror a real-world clinical setting where follow-up measures become
available during routine care and a patient’s changes in risk factors translate into greater (or lesser) risks for a
CVD event. Third, we will examine a wide array of socioeconomic, psychosocial, and behavioral factors to
identify SDOH and other key factors related to individual risk profiles and CVD outcomes. The major aims of
this proposal are highly aligned with the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) mission to better understand the
interdisciplinary dynamics of aging to prevent disease in older adults. Our study responds to this call by using
multiple datasets and innovative methods to optimize CVD risk assessment in older adults. With this integrated
new knowledge, our study will have significant potential to better inform the design, targeting, and timing of
clinical interventions to improve the primary prevention of CVD in a diverse and aging U.S. population."
10873024,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Twenty-five years ago, the University of Massachusetts launched a training program at the interface of
chemistry and biology. The program built on existing strengths and harnessed our commitment to building
bridges between the physical and life sciences. Since then, the University of Massachusetts has undergone a
complete transformation in the life sciences. Massive investments in state-of-the-art core facilities and research
buildings coupled with the hiring of over 50 new faculty has revolutionized the research capacity on campus.
By establishing a collaborative community and interdisciplinary curriculum, the Chemistry-Biology Interface
(CBI) training program has been at the center of this growth. The 31 CBI Training Faculty now train a total of
162 talented students, 54 of whom are eligible for support from the CBI training grant. CBI students come from
five participating graduate programs: Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Microbiology, Molecular & Cellular
Biology, and Polymer Science & Engineering. The CBI curriculum is designed to complement the requirements
of these programs, to achieve four objectives: 1) to provide fluency in both chemistry and biology concepts,
tools, and opportunities; 2) to communicate and collaborate effectively with scientists from diverse chemistry
and biology research backgrounds; 3) to follow best practices in performing rigorous and reproducible
research; and 4) to increase awareness of career opportunities and build the appropriate skills to network
effectively in order to take advantage of these opportunities. Robust participation of ~ 60 CBI student members
who complete the curriculum, regardless of funding, demonstrates the perceived high value of this training. In
this proposal, we seek to enhance the training capacity of the CBI program by requesting twelve trainee slots,
which will be matched with four slots annually from UMass. Over the next five years, the cohort of CBI trainees
will participate in several innovative training activities, including a revised curriculum incorporating the
principles of rigor and reproducibility, specialized laboratory modules designed to introduce trainees to new
concepts and techniques, and a biennial Alumni Symposium where current trainees will have the opportunity to
connect with our network of 143 alumni. Equipped with this comprehensive skillset, graduates from our CBI
program will be well-prepared to solve frontier problems in biology and biomedicine."
10877697,"Skeletal muscles are responsible for movement, breathing, posture and metabolism. Loss of muscle function via acute injury or chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. In the US, there are over 12 million cases of sprains and strains injuries each year, an estimated 50 million people living with age-related sarcopenia, and another 250,000 with NMDs. My long-term goal is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms which underlie the muscle repair and develop therapies for chronic muscle disorders. A major barrier in this endeavor is our limited of understanding of the multiplicity of cell types involved during muscle regeneration. Little is known regarding functions of each cell type and how they interact with tissue-resident stem cells to regulate the restoration of muscle function. Thus, tissue cytometry, the mapping of single cells within tissues, is necessary to gain novel insights into cellular interactions during muscle regeneration and in dysregulated disease states. My central hypothesis is that local signaling in the cellular microenvironment regulate the behavior of critical cell types to remodel or repair the tissue. To this, I have optimized a novel multiplexed imaging technology (CODEX) that enables visualizes 40+ antibodies on a single muscle section. In the proposed research, I aim to (i) develop technologies to study cellular interactions using high dimensional imaging data and build a single cell resolution spatial map of the localization, abundance, dynamics, and interactions of 25 cell type within normal muscle regeneration and disease states; (ii) elucidate critical cell types and spatially-localized signaling that determine the proper expansion and differentiation of muscle stem cells; (iii) deep profile the function of M2 macrophages and fibroadipogenic precursors in process of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling. The training I will receive during the mentored phase of this proposal will be critical for the success of this project. Moreover, application of this systematic approach to study inter-cellular signaling will allow me to achieve academic independence. The proposed experiments in the K99 phase will provide novel insights into the coordinated process of tissue regeneration and will yield candidate signaling molecules with the potential to modulate the function of muscle stem cells. Further, the proposed project for the R00 phase will lead to better understanding of the cellular responses and fundamental mechanisms of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling, which has significant relevance for nerve injuries and chronic autoimmune neuromuscular diseases."
10836465,"ABSTRACT Microsporidia are intracellular pathogens related to the Fungi that have been studied for more
than 150 years. They are opportunistic pathogens in patients with AIDS, most commonly causing diarrhea,
encephalitis, myositis, or conjunctivitis. In patients with advanced AIDS they have been etiologic in up to 30%
of cases of chronic diarrhea with wasting. Microsporidia have also been found to cause infections in other
immunocompromised hosts, such as patients who have undergone organ transplantation or those on immune
modulating therapies. Infections are now also being recognized in immune competent hosts causing either
keratoconjunctivitis or diarrhea. Microsporidia are classified as NIH category B priority pathogens and EPA
pathogens of interest as they are transmitted by both food and water sources. In addition to being human
pathogens, these pathogenic organisms have major economic impacts on agriculture (via effects on insects
and sericulture), aquaculture and animals (food, domestic and wildlife). Infections in animals range from
cryptic, benign infections to spectacular, massive infections that cause extensive damage and often death of
the host. Microsporidia produce spores containing a unique invasion organelle, the polar tube, which is one
of the most complex single celled forms known in the biological world. The mechanism by which the polar
tube interacts with its host cell during invasion is still unknown. A long standing research program in my
laboratory group is focused on understanding the mechanism of invasion and the structural biology and
composition of the polar tube. We have developed techniques for the purification of this structure, identified
polar tube proteins (PTPs) and their post translational modifications, and defined methods to study how these
proteins interact. Furthermore, our investigations have defined the invasion synapse and the functional role(s)
of several PTPs in the process of invasion. However, the full complement of proteins in this structure and the
interactions of these components during invasion remain to be determined. This research grant will employ
a combination of proteomic, immunologic and ultrastructural studies to characterize the polar tube and its
protein interactome to better define and understand the mechanism of invasion. Furthermore, advanced
microscopic techniques (i.e. cryo-EM and super resolution microscopy) will be employed to provide insight
into the three dimensional structure of the polar tube and arrangement of PTPs providing critical information
on fundamental questions concerning the organization of this invasion organelle that have not been able to
be resolved by traditional microscopy. In other microbes studies on invasion have provided critical data for
understanding pathogenesis and for new therapeutic approaches to the management of infections. We have
already demonstrated that antisera to various PTPs can inhibit invasion and infection. We believe that studies
of the composition, formation and function of this organelle during germination and invasion should provide a
basis for the development of new strategies for control of these important HIV-associated pathogens."
10833048,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The promise of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hSC-CMs) opens doors towards the feasibility
of personalized medicine against cardiac diseases and for performing more accurate drug discovery studies.
Moreover, hSC-CMs overcome the issue of species differences when using animal models for high throughput
screening studies. However, one of the bottlenecks for scaling up the use of hSC-CMs is their ability to accurately
reflect the native structure and function of adult human cardiomyocytes. Current efforts to address this critical
challenge involve maturation protocols that use biophysical cues such as electrical stimulation or substrate-
induced tissue alignment. Methods for electrical stimulation often utilize electrode contacts for field stimulation,
bulky instrumentation for combining electrical stimuli delivery with mechanical or sustained chemical stimulation,
or genetically modifying cells to be light-responsive. Although we have seen successes through these induction
and stimulation approaches, the field would benefit from a stimulation approach with minimal culture contact to
reduce risk of infection during long-term cultures, as well as a light-based approach with higher spatiotemporal
resolution than electrode-based stimulation. Here, we propose a new paradigm for stimulating hSC-CMs towards
maturation by interfacing these cells with peptide-based substrates that can induce tissue anisotropy and
are engineered to convert light to stimulatory cues. Our team will develop peptides functionalized with
chromophore units and cell-binding epitopes as materials that can be used for light-based stimulation of hSC-
CMs, in combination with induction of tissue alignment, towards maturation. The long-term goal of this project is
to establish light stimulation via engineered peptides as a viable method to stimulate cardiomyocytes and
promote hSC-CM maturation in an electrodeless and non-genetic manner. We hypothesize that transient
charging and other associated light-induced processes at the cardiomyocyte-biomaterial interface can influence
extracellular potential, resulting in the photostimulation of hSC-CMs towards maturation. Our rationale for
proposing a materials-based approach for stimulating hSC-CMs stems from previous reports of conjugated
polymers being used as a photoactive substrate for triggering action potentials of other excitable cells. To test
our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: (1) establishing design parameters for engineered
peptide substrates with optimal photostimulation efficiency; (2) test the cellular- and tissue-level impact of
peptide-mediated photostimulation in combination with anisotropic cues; and (3) elucidate the effect of the
proposed photostimulation method, along with anisotropy cues, on hSC-CM maturation. By establishing the
design rules for the proposed photoexcitable peptides for eliciting combinatorial cues to stimulate hSC-CMs and
ensure their capability to excite cardiac cells, this innovative approach offers a new strategy for a “wireless”
stimulation of cardiac tissues towards maturation, and can therefore significantly contribute towards addressing
the grand challenge of immaturity of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes."
10835925,"Metastatic disease is the primary cause of cancer mortality, but effective treatments remain elusive. Therefore,
our LONG-TERM GOAL is to address the CRITICAL NEED for more targeted strategies to treat metastatic
disease. The Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc42 and their downstream effector p21-activated kinase (PAK)
are pivotal regulators of metastatic cancer cell migration and invasion; and thus, represent ideal targets for
prevention of metastasis. Rac and Cdc42 do not have to be overexpressed in cancer to drive metastasis,
because they can be over activated by oncogenic cell surface receptor signaling pathways. Therefore, we
developed MBQ-167, which inhibits Rac and Cdc42 activation by blocking GTP exchange without affecting
expression. MBQ-167 is superior to other known Rac/Cdc42 inhibitors, and inhibits cell and tumor growth,
metastasis and survival of metastases in breast and pancreatic cancer cell and mouse models at low
physiological concentrations. Moreover, MBQ-167 has an excellent safety profile in both rodents and dogs (both
non-GLP and GLP studies completed) up to 1000 mg/kg body weight and has acceptable bioavailability in rodent
and dog plasma and tumor tissue (IND submitted to the US FDA). The rationale for this application stems from
the PI’s SC3 GM084824 award (2008-2022), which resulted in ~25 publications, 3 patents, graduated 8 Ph.D.
students, and trained numerous graduate and undergraduate students, all of whom are underrepresented
minorities. During the present cycle of the SC3 award, we identified two new Rac/Cdc42 inhibitors, MBQ-168
and EHop-097, with enhanced efficacy compared to their respective parent molecules MBQ-167 and EHop-016.
This SuRE proposal will test the HYPOTHSIS that Rac/Cdc42 inhibitors are viable antimetastatic cancer
therapeutics in breast and pancreatic cancer. Aim 1 will demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and bioavailability
of Rac/Cdc42 inhibitors MBQ-168 and EHop-097 in pre-clinical mouse models using chemiluminescence
imaging of luciferase tagged breast and pancreatic cancer cells in mice from spontaneous and experimental
metastasis assays. Aim 2 will demonstrate the efficacy of Rac/Cdc42 inhibitors in ex vivo cultures of
patient tissues. Our innovative research design will use fresh breast and pancreatic cancer patient tissue (from
biopsies and surgery), in ex vivo cultures, to test for changes in cancer cell proliferation, immune cell infiltration,
and inhibitor efficacy following short-term vehicle, MBQ-167, MBQ-168, or EHop-097 treatment. Drug efficacy in
cancer cells and the immune cells infiltrating the tumor microenvironment (TME) will be assessed in situ via
immunohistochemistry, using specific antibodies to pharmacodynamic markers of Rac/Cdc42 efficacy, as well
as immune cells in the TME. The OUTCOME of this study will delineate the complex action of Rac/Cdc42
inhibitors in experimental mouse models and patient tissues and forward the translational development of
Rac/Cdc42 inhibitors in pancreatic and breast cancer. Moreover, graduate, undergraduate, and medical students
will be trained in cutting edge techniques and concepts of cancer drug development."
10914779,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite enormous growth in research related to child health and development, there is a significant lag in
corresponding growth of this workforce, especially for underrepresented individuals. There remains a dearth of
trainees entering into and remaining in these careers. Many pediatricians have limited exposure to research
during their training. Those who have received formal research training—ranging from short-term “boot camps”
to master’s programs—or who work in a laboratory often are taught how to perform certain research skills (e.g.,
clinical study design) but do not know how to develop a rigorous research question. Overly specialized research
training and lack of funding and resources limit the ability to adapt to a changing environment that is increasingly
collaborative. Correspondingly, child health research funding has lagged and is disproportionate to funding for
adult-focused research; only 10% of the NIH budget supports child health research (despite that 22% of the US
population are children). Thus, there is a need to train individuals in a broad array of pediatric-specific
research skills across diverse domains of child health and development in order to optimize their match
quality (i.e., aligning their career choice with who they are and their skills and interests) to promote their
long-term success. The Wake Forest University School of Medicine (WFUSM) Training in Research Affecting
Child Health (TRAC) Program will provide a novel child health and development research training opportunity
across the spectrum of educational levels (undergraduate, graduate, and medical students, residents, and
fellows). TRAC will foster acquisition of lasting child health-related research skills with an emphasis on
independence and critical thinking. Modeled after a WFUSM Department of Pediatrics pilot program, and
leveraging existing WFUSM training programs, TRAC will support novel, horizontal peer-to-peer mentorship
through an immersive eight-week pediatric-specific skills course over the summer combined with the
development and implementation of collaborative research projects with guidance from faculty mentors that will
continue throughout the following academic year so participants can see their project to completion. This will
culminate in abstract submissions to the Pediatric Academic Societies Annual Meeting the following spring and
submission of a first-authored manuscript. This approach will provide an important sense of ownership and
accomplishment to further empower the participants and generate excitement to enter the field of child health
and development. TRAC will therefore take advantage of a broad educational focus, unique mentorship, and
novel participant empowerment to optimize match quality in order to help participants identify and develop their
strengths and interests to promote lasting interest in research related to child health and development and
enhance the diversity of the research workforce involved in NICHD mission-focused research."

financial support from the adult and pediatric GI Divisions to a diverse array of institutional programs promoting
research education. Thanks to these, our Program has excelled and majority of our graduates from the last
cycle are pursuing an investigative career, in academic institutions.
We propose to continue the strong tradition of physician-scientist training, adherence to all ACGME
recommended practices within fellowship training, and establish a more enhanced focus on diversity, inclusion
and wellness of our trainees and faculty, and seek to enhance it to best prepare our trainees for the future of
digestive medicine."
10769859,"Project Summary
The University of Minnesota (UMN) and Photonic Pharma (PP) a Minnesota-based drug discovery start-up, have
partnered to optimize, field-test, and deploy at industrial scale, an innovative new approach to developing
allosteric kinase inhibitors (AKI). These molecules have high potential as novel cancer therapeutics that
circumvent clinical resistance to conventional orthosteric kinase inhibitors (OKI). We have developed high-
throughput screening (HTS) technology based on nanosecond fluorescence lifetime (FLT) detection of Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET), that tracks ligand-driven kinase allostery with angstrom precision by
monitoring structural changes of the activation loop, the key regulatory element in all kinases. This is the first
HTS-amenable technology that accurately resolves allosteric effects of kinase inhibitors, relying on high-quality
nanosecond FLT readouts unavailable from conventional fluorescence plate readers (PR). PP have developed
a proprietary HTS platform that uses FRET biosensors and a state-of-the-art FLT-PR to detect structural
readouts in <2 min for 384-well and <5 min for 1536-well plates. By partnering with PP, we will transform our
kinase FRET sensor technology into a broadly applicable drug-discovery platform for identifying AKIs.
We propose drug-discovery programs on two different targets to demonstrate broad utility and accelerate large-
scale adoption of our technology for drug development. In AIM 1, we identify Aurora A inhibitors that
downregulate the undruggable c-Myc oncoprotein by inhibiting the scaffolding interaction of Aurora A with c-
Myc. These molecules would represent a novel treatment strategy for the large number of cancer patients with
c-Myc-driven tumors. In AIM 2, we identify allosteric inhibitors of the c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase as a novel
therapeutic strategy for patients with c-MET-driven lung cancer. These patients invariably develop resistance to
current MET inhibitors through acquired mutations in the ATP site, and allosteric inhibitors that bind outside the
ATP-site would circumvent this mode of resistance, filling an unmet clinical need. This UMN-PP partnership
translates decades of biophysics research by two world-leading experts – Levinson and Thomas – toward drug-
discovery by resolving ligand-driven allostery in kinases. This is enabled by the FLT-PR instrumentation and
know-how required to implement nanosecond FLT detection in assays that resolve allosteric inhibitors in true
HTS mode. This overcomes key drawbacks of conventional kinase inhibitor screens, which detect kinase
inhibition or binding without regard to allosteric mechanism. The platform is broadly applicable, as almost all
kinases undergo the large-scale allosteric structural changes our technology detects. Success of this
project will catalyze adoption of this technology targeting a wide range of biomedically important kinases, as
highlighted by Photonic Pharma’s successful partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb on drug discovery for other
high-priority therapeutic targets."
10778565,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia, is associated with high morbidity and mortality, but
remains difficult to treat due to an incomplete understanding of underlying mechanisms. Emerging evidence
suggests that nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) play an important role in the heart by being able to
elevate cAMP levels in a G-protein receptor-independent manner. Our pilot data suggest that increased levels
of NDPK-B and NDPK-C isoforms in patients with persistent (chronic) AF are associated with elevated cAMP
levels, abnormal sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ releases, ectopic (triggered) activity and inducible AF. The long-
term goal of this project is to dissect the molecular and cellular basis of NDPK-dependent arrhythmia
mechanisms in AF. The central hypothesis is that enhanced NDPK-B and -C levels promote AF by enhancing
cAMP levels in the RyR2 microdomain, resulting in aberrant intracellular Ca2+ signaling that creates a substrate
for AF initiation, maintenance, and progression. Three specific aims will be pursued: 1) Determine whether
increased NDPK expression is both necessary and sufficient to promote spontaneous AF, 2) Assess whether
elevated NDPK levels cause cAMP-dependent SR Ca2+ leak via RyR2, and 3) Determine the role of Ankrd1
within the RyR2-NDPK signaling complex. These studies will be performed in atrial myocytes from patients
with AF, a dog model of AF, and various atrial-selective genetic mouse models of AF. Novel targeted cAMP
FRET sensors and atrial-selective adeno-associated virus (AAV9)-mediated gene therapy will be utilized to
resolve the pro-arrhythmic roles of NDPK-B/C and cAMP within specific cellular microdomains. These studies
are expected to establish whether and how NDPK isoforms contributes to AF development and serve as a
platform for the validation of NDPKs as novel druggable target for the prevention or treatment of AF."

Increasing diversity and inclusiveness within the Pediatric Neurosciences workforce will help close the gap in
health disparities and accelerate research efforts that will lead to new treatments for pediatric brain disorders.
Minority populations are affected by cognitive and neurological conditions at a rate higher than other groups, yet
they are involved in neuroscience research at a much lower rate. The NIH/NINDS has demonstrated leadership
in addressing this critical disparity by creating an NINDS Office of Programs to Enhance Neuroscience Workforce
Diversity (OPEN) and developing specific individual and institutional funding opportunities to promote inclusion
across the NINDS scientific portfolio. The current proposal will create the St. Louis Summer Research Immersion
Program in Pediatric Neuroscience (SSRIP) to provide an innovative research training experience to high school
students who might not otherwise have access to such opportunities. This R25 research education program is
both innovative and responsive to the priorities of the NINDS. It directly addresses the stated priorities of the
NINDS to eliminate disparities in the Pediatric Neurosciences workforce, enhance creativity and innovation
through diverse representation, broaden the scope of biomedical inquiry, and ensure fairness in our diverse
nation. Further, the SSRIP models the NIH Scientific Diversity Toolkit by developing all four key focus areas: 1)
a diverse candidate pool; 2) unbiased talent searches; 3) outreach and networking; and 4) mentoring
relationships. Washington University's educational environment presents an ideal context and substantial
existing infrastructure to develop this unique training program. Thus, in addressing PAR-21-168, SSRIP will
advance the collective mission of the NINDS, WUSM, and the St. Louis community of enhancing the diversity
and inclusiveness of the Pediatric Neurosciences research workforce both locally and more broadly."
10772129,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus that can lead to
irreversible renal impairment. Current immunosuppressive therapies fail to reverse disease in more than half of
treated patients and only 2 new drugs have been approved treatment, both of which confer only modest
improvement. Renal myeloid cells are involved in renal injury in LN, both in humans and animal models.
Macrophages are highly plastic and can mediate both pro-inflammatory and reparative functions. Because
there are so many subsets of myeloid cells and some of them change their function over time, analysis of
single cells is crucial to the study of these cells. Initial studies in Phase 1 and early Phase 2 of the
Accelerating Medicines Partnerships-SLE (AMP-SLE), of which we are all members, have shown that there are
multiple subsets of macrophages in LN kidneys that are analogous to myeloid subsets in mice but the function
of these subsets and whether they are pathogenic, or protective is still not known. Study of kidney tissues in
LN patients is hampered by the small size of the kidney biopsy and the infrequency of these biopsies in
individual patients over the course of their disease. Therefore, animal models, when carefully and rigorously
employed, are especially useful for addressing hypotheses generated by examining human data.
 Our overall hypothesis is that we will identify human-relevant myeloid cell subsets in LN models that
reflect differences in disease pathophysiology, disease stage and responsiveness to treatments and that this
information will help identify new pathways for therapeutic intervention and direct personalized treatment. Our
approach is focused on identifying and testing the function of human-relevant cell subsets and pathways in
vitro and under physiologic conditions in vivo. In Aim 1 we will complete the integration of single cell RNASeq
analysis of myeloid cells from 5 different models of LN with that from AMP-SLE Phase 2 to map both shared
and unique macrophage sub-populations. We will follow the fate of peripheral myeloid cells as they transition
from the blood into the kidneys to define how the nephritis-specific profile of each subset and how they are
related to each other. We will then determine whether there is a particular myeloid cell profile that is associated
with response or non-response of LN patients to standard of care therapy. In Aim 2 we will determine how
renal myeloid cells interact with renal stromal cells both in vitro and in vivo. We will analyze the fate of renal
myeloid cells (in responder and non-responder mice) in human-relevant mouse models treated with remission
induction therapies to identify reparative subsets and pathways. Our focus here will be on both standard of
care therapy and on belimumab (anti-BAFF) since this is the only biologic drug so far approved for treatment of
LN and for prevention of further renal flares. In Aim 3 we will use CRISPR libraries for in vivo targeting of 13
transcription factors we have identified in preliminary studies to screen for new therapeutic approaches to
protect LN kidneys from disease progression, fibrosis, and end stage renal disease."
10791925,"Memory loss is a hallmark symptom of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). By identifying its
early stages, interventions could be developed to prevent or slow ADRD progression. While previous research
has examined memory aging among the general population, the long-term memory aging of older cancer
survivors is under-studied. This is a critical evidence gap, as >26 million people in the United States (US) and
>5 million people in the United Kingdom (UK) will be cancer survivors by 2040, and >70% of cancer survivors
will be over age 65. The US and UK have different health care systems, government social safety net policies,
and magnitudes of income inequality. Hence, older cancer survivors are aging in different social, political, and
economic environments across these two high-income countries. A cross-national comparison of the US and UK
is an opportunity to identify drivers of both individual-level variation and population-level differences in the
memory aging of older cancer survivors. Understanding the long-term memory aging of older cancer survivors
in a cross-national framework will enhance our knowledge of what factors matter most for the memory aging of
older cancer survivors and could be targets for interventions. This K99/R00 proposal leverages longitudinal pre-
and post-cancer diagnosis data from two nationally representative cohorts, the US Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), to investigate long-term memory trajectories of
N=2,500 older cancer survivors from 2002 to 2018. The specific aims are to: (1) identify and compare memory
trajectories of cancer survivors in the HRS and ELSA, overall and by age and sex (K99 phase); (2) identify and
compare individual, neighborhood, and macro-level socioeconomic inequalities in memory aging of cancer
survivors in the HRS and ELSA (R00 phase); and, (3) identify the roles of modifiable risk and resilience factors
(hypertension, diabetes, obesity, depression, physical activity, social support) across countries, as these may
be intervention targets to promote healthy memory aging among older cancer survivors (R00 phase). The training
plan will build on the applicant’s prior training in social and cancer epidemiology to include: (1) ADRD research
among cancer survivors; (2) the measurement and analysis of multi-level socioeconomic exposures; (3) and
complex longitudinal data analyses in a cross-national framework. This integrated training will prepare the
applicant for a successful independent research career focused on the social determinants of healthy aging
among older cancer survivors. The applicant is supported by a cohesive and interdisciplinary mentorship team,
including HRS and ELSA leadership. Identifying country-level differences in risk and resilience for cancer-related
memory aging is important for informing population-level interventions and will support the exploration of policy-
relevant determinants in future research. The proposed research will unite the fields of cancer survivorship and
ADRD research by using a cross-national, population-based approach to identify high-risk groups of older cancer
survivors for accelerated memory decline, as well as identify modifiable risk factors as intervention targets."
10809618,"The TOPP Collaborative Merit will test the central hypothesis that heterogeneity in OA pain and structural
progression is related to the “immune pathotype” of OA, which arises from the variability in the cellular and
molecular responses of bone, cartilage, and synovium to inflammation and joint mechanical environment. The
overarching Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To improve understanding of osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis to enable
development of targeted early treatment approaches; and Aim 2: To establish preclinical and clinical data for
new therapeutic targets to reduce pain and prevent OA progression.
This VA Merit is Project 2 of our TOPP Collaborative Merit. This Merit will use biospecimens from early and
late OA clinical cohorts prevalent in the the VA health care system to define the immune pathotypes of OA,
with the ultimate goal of using biomarkers for these pathotypes to guide care. Previous studies from our
laboratory implicate “low-grade” innate immune inflammation, and we previously identified key roles for
dysregulated activation of the complement system, mast cells, and inflammatory macrophage in the
pathogenesis of OA. In further invetigations of the cellular, transcriptional and molecular profiles of synovial
membranes from early and late OA, we observe distinct transcriptional signatures, immune cell populations,
and immune pathway activation. We hypothesize that differences in the immune cell composition and
activation states in synovium, bone and cartilage will identify “immune pathotypes” of OA, and that these
immune pathotypes will be associated with differential levels of pain, structural progression, and/or response to
treatment. In Aim 1, we propose to perform proteomic, bulk RNA-Seq, single cell RNA-Seq, and multiplex
immunostaining of human pre-OA (with Dr. Chu) and OA synovial tissues. Aim 2 will perform integrated
informatic analyses using machine learning and other approaches to identify immune pathotypes of human
pre-OA and OA. Aim 3 will determine if the immune pathotypes identified correlate with OA pain and structural
pathology in humans, and/or response to tVNS (with Dr. Humphrey) or anti-NGF (with Dr. Nakamura) in mice.
Success of the herein proposed studies and of our overarching TOPP Collaborative Merit proposal would
transform our understanding of the pathobiology of OA, and could lead to more effective approaches to treat
pain and the first ever disease-modifying therapy for OA."
10888147,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
High rates of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with delinquency (and recidivism)
persist for justice-involved individuals. This enduring problem denotes a significant gap in our treatment
approach. PTSD, the primary outcome of the proposed study about healing informed mindfulness-based stress
reduction (MBSR), combines stress-inflammation/cortisol reactivity, recidivism, personal agency, racial identity,
and parent-child relationships (secondary outcomes), which contribute to the overall health equity and well-being
of justice-involved Black/African American female adolescents (JI BAFAs). The proposed study will investigate
the barriers and facilitators to the MBSR intervention with JI BAFAs and their P/Cs. MBSR has been successfully
implemented as a treatment for PTSD and is a promising new approach for healing to reduce health disparities
among both JI BAFAs and their P/Cs. We will use a healing-informed MBSR approach based on an intersectional
trauma-responsive (ITR) framework: Intersectionality theory, Healing Centered Engagement (HCE), and
Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). HCE is based on healing justice, a strengths-based framework to re-
center culture and improve and nurture well-being that involves transforming institutions and relationships that
cause harm to collectively heal and foster hope. TDF comprises 7 stages to assess implementation problems
and supports intervention design as a solution to the theory-practice gap as it helps identify theoretically driven
targets for interventions based on content-specific information about the behavior targeted to change, i.e., PTSD
symptoms. For this study, we expect to enroll (35 JI BAFAs and P/C dyads) in Franklin County, OH. This two-
phase study follows a multimodal mixed methods design, comprising two phases. Phase I includes collecting
qualitative interview data about their past barriers to treatment and interventions and use this information as well
as self-report survey results to culturally adapt until we reach saturation. Participants will complete study
assessments with psychosocial and biological (biomarker) data (n = 10 JI BAFAs-P/Cs dyads) (Aim 1). Phase
II consists of conducting a nonrandomized pilot test of the adapted intervention adapted healing intervention to
assess the feasibility of recruitment, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the adapted intervention on the
study outcomes. Dyads will complete assessments, and psychosocial and biological data at baseline,
immediately after the final intervention session (~ 3 months post baseline) and again 6-months post-baseline.
Clinically meaningful improvements in PTSD symptoms (primary outcome) and stress/cortisol reactivity,
recidivism, agency, racial identity, parent-child relationships (secondary outcomes) will be examined. (n = 25 JI
BAFAs-P/Cs dyads) (Aim 2). We will also promote healing of the dyads’ relationship dynamic via the intervention
to create a corrective outcome for P/Cs and JI BAFAs, including the use of safety procedures (Exploratory
Aim). We will hold two separate focus groups with 6 dyads who completed the MBSR intervention to elicit
feedback on the initial qualitative findings. The study findings will be integrated based on the two types of data."
10782507,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 The cornea is a unique structure that remarkably maintains its optic clarity by remaining completely
avascular. Diseases in which the optical clarity of the cornea is lost are the third most common cause of
blindness worldwide. Although the etiology of these diseases may be distinct, most converge on a common
pathway leading to the growth of pathological vessels in this tissue, a process known as corneal
neovascularization (CoNV). CoNV is ultimately a consequence of an imbalance between proangiogenic factors
and antiangiogenic factors in the corneal limbus. As vascular and lymphatic vessels grow into the corneal
stroma, edema, inflammation, protein and lipid deposition, and scarring can occur, leading to corneal opacities,
visual impairment or blindness. It is estimated that 1.4 million people develop CoNV per year, 12% of whom
suffer the subsequent significant loss of vision.
 We have recently described the role of Angiopoeitin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), as a potent pro-angiogenic and
vessel hyperpermeability factor in posterior segment diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, proliferative
sickle retinopathy, and uveal melanoma. Interestingly, we recently found an additive effect in the induction of
vessel hyperpermeability by ANGPTL4 and VEGFA. Furthermore, we found that ANGPTL4 binds Neuropilin
(NRP)1 and 2, two plasma membrane isoforms that act as co-receptors for several members of the VEGF
family. More recently, we have observed a role for ANGPTL4 in promoting angiogenesis in the anterior
segment, leading to the development of CoNV and corneal pterygia. Growing appreciation of the role of
lymphangiogenesis in the development of anterior segment pathological angiogenesis prompted us to explore
a role for ANGPTL4 in this process. Recently, we have observed that ANGPTL4 potently induces the migration
and sprouting of lymphatic endothelial cells (lECs), and this appears to be dependent on ANGPTL4 binding to
NRP2. Collectively, these observations suggest that ANGPTL4 could play a central role in the development of
CoNV. We propose that a combinatorial therapy targeting VEGFs and ANGPTL4 may be a more effective
treatment for CoNV patients.
 The objective of this proposal is to investigate the role of ANGPTL4/NRPs alone or in combination with
VEGFs as regulators of hemangiogenesis and lymphangionesis and thus as important pathways influencing
the avascularity of the cornea. The successful completion of these investigations will move us towards a
combinational therapy targeting ANGPTL4 and VEGF signaling as a novel alternative for the treatment of
CoNV."
10745729,"Early life adversity, including childhood maltreatment and other traumas, is a major risk factor for a host of
aging-related conditions, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, pain syndromes, and diabetes. Health
behaviors, such as poor diet and sedentary lifestyle, and adult stressors, are linked to childhood adversity and
further contribute to risk for these diseases. These effects compound over time and poor health outcomes are
most evident in adults when biological effects of stress and health behaviors combine with age-related decline
to produce frank disease. There is now substantial evidence of glucocorticoid and inflammatory mechanisms
that accelerate aging and confer risk for disease following early adversity. Converging evidence from animal
models and recent human studies indicate that mitochondria play a key role in coordinating the stress
response and in the aging process, and may be a mechanism of risk for these stress- and age-related
disorders. Recent work in humans has implicated mitochondria in the effect of early trauma on risk for
psychiatric disorders. Our laboratory showed that mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) is increased in
leukocytes of healthy adults with a history of childhood trauma, as well as those with depressive and anxiety
disorders. Results of other recent studies suggest that stress is linked with alterations of mitochondrial
enzymes and impaired mitochondrial respiration. Health behaviors, such as diet, exercise, and sleep, may be
altered with early adversity and play an important role in the effects of early adversity on molecular and health
outcomes indicative of accelerated aging. The proposed study leverages data and specimens available in a
study of childhood maltreatment that includes rich data on exposures, health behaviors, biological specimens,
and health outcomes. Results of this study are expected to provide insight into the biological mechanisms of
adversity-related risk for accelerated aging and risk for disease, and provide targets for new treatment and
prevention approaches."
10830332,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Blood vessels play a central role in maintaining host immunity by transporting immune cells to sites of infection.
During the process, blood vessels experience endothelial junction remodeling to control vascular permeability
and immune cell extravasation. Under infection, blood vessels become permeable and allow immune cells to
extravasate and kill pathogens in the interstitium. Once the infection is resolved, permeable vessels become less
permeable and limit the number of interstitial immune cells. However, sometimes in inflammation, the remodeling
is perturbed, resulting in prolonged, hyper-permeable blood vessels. This vascular dysfunction contributes to
immune diseases, such as chronic inflammation, lupus, and autoimmune disease. It is known that endothelial
cell alignment is crucial to maintain intact cell-cell adhesion and promote junction maturation. Despite the
significance of the cell alignment in functional endothelium, currently available high-throughput methods, such
as real-time cell analysis (RTCA) and trans-epithelial/trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) systems with
randomly seeded cells have not successfully measured cell impedance or electrical resistance through the in
vivo-like controlled endothelial cell morphology, alignment, and matured cell-cell junctions. Furthermore, the
current technologies lack pericyte co-culture with endothelial cells. In this proposal, we will develop a high-
throughput, high-content functional screening assay capable of faster drug screening and mechanistic studies
on blood vessel barrier function and immune cell extravasation. To achieve our goals, we will establish a
nanopatterned IEA-based functional assay for high-throughput phenotype screening of pericyte-covered
endothelium. To establish the nanopatterned IEA-based assay, we will determine conditions for junctional
maturation of human dermal and lung microvascular endothelial cells with or without pericytes, focusing on (i)
degree of cell alignment; (ii) expression of adherens junctions, polarization, and basement membrane markers;
(iii) vascular barrier function (Aim 1.1). We will then assess vascular gene expression profiles related to vessel
stabilization and immune cell adhesion. We will next evaluate immune cell extravasation through the endothelium
in the non-inflammatory condition to determine immune cell behaviors in steady-state blood vessels (Aim 1.2).
Next, we will validate the utility of the system for inflammation-induced blood vessel dysfunction. To achieve this
aim, we will examine the endothelial barrier function and immune cell extravasation in five different categories of
inflammatory cytokines and various levels of substrate stiffness considering skin and lung microenvironments
(Aim 2.1). Lastly, we will identify potential targets and drugs to reverse vessel dysfunction by focusing on
abrogation of the cytokine effect and the stiffness effect, separately or in combination (Aim 2.2). In summary, our
system will constitute a significant improvement over existing technologies as it represents a novel high-
throughput screening tool for functionally matured blood endothelium and their interactions with immune cells."
10747426,"Maintenance of healthy dendritic spine and synapse function is essential for normal brain function. The number of dendritic spines is precisely controlled and coordinated by synaptic activity to ensure functional brain network integrity. It is well-established that disruptions of the density, shape and size of dendritic spines are associated with psychiatric disorders. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is an information processing center and forms brain circuit with hippocampus. The hippocampus is well established as an important brain area for cognition. This cognitive dysfunction found in psychiatric disorders may result from disruptions of the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex circuit. The hippocampus and mPFC are vulnerable to stress. Stress is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders such as depression. Chronic stress-induced cognitive deficit is accompanied by a decrease in spine density and impaired synaptic plasticity in the pyramidal neurons of the rodent mPFC and hippocampal CA1 area. But the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Tight regulation of protein degradation is critical for normal brain function. Maintaining normal ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which regulates protein degradation, is necessary for proper development of the brain, synapse formation and plasticity. Dysregulation of UPS results in diseases, e.g. mutations in E3 ligase cause psychiatric disorders. Constitutive photomorphogenesis protein 1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a critical and negative regulator of its various substrates. COP1 plays an essential role in mouse brain development, but function of COP1 in the adult brain is unknown. Genome-wide association studies showed that COP1 is a risk factor for anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and autism. Our preliminary studies showed that COP1 is localized to principal neurons of the mouse prefrontal cortex; COP1 deletion in the principal neurons of the forebrain cortex and hippocampal CA1 in COP1 conditional knockout (Cop1CKO) mice caused an increase in spine density and an enhancement in excitatory synaptic functions in these neurons; these Cop1CKO mice show enhanced cognitive functions and resilience to chronic stress. These preliminary results raise our hypothesis that COP1 plays an important role in dendritic spines, cognition and stress resilience. Our aims are to test this hypothesis: Determine the role of COP1 in spine formation and synaptic functions using Cop1cko mice and WT littermate controls, determine the role of COP1 in cognition and stress resilience, and identify significant substrates through which COP1 affects dendritic spines, cognition and stress resilience. Spatial memory and recognition memory are related to stress and stress-related disorders, and align with declarative memory construct in cognitive system domain of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). The results from this study may enhance our understanding of spine formation, cognition, stress resilience and lead to the development of novel interventions for reversing cognitive impairments, enhancing stress resilience, and for treating stress-related disorders. The outcomes of this study are associated with mental health."
10835122,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The objective of this proposal is to establish magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessment of extracellular
matrix (ECM) damage and cellular energy metabolism in human tendon. Tendinopathies are painful conditions
effecting joints in upper and lower extremities, comprise 30% of referrals to musculoskeletal specialists, and
remain challenging to treat. Tendinopathy is associated with accumulated damage to the ECM from chronic
and repetitive overloading and exhibits complex and multifactorial pathogenesis altering both mechanical and
cell biological function. The maintenance and repair (homeostasis) of tendon ECM is regulated by force-
sensitive tendon cells that are coupled to local tissue loads through the ECM. Dysregulated ECM homeostasis
can be related to extensive structural damage and diminished cellular response to environmental forces.
Evaluation of tendinopathy in humans is limited by a lack of non-invasive approaches to assess both ECM
(structure) and cellular response (function). Recent applications of ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI have
demonstrated exciting potential for providing quantitative indices of tendon properties that are sensitive to
pathological changes. We have recently identified tendon ECM molecules and metabolites based on 1H NMR
chemical shift assignments using high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS). We have also developed a
novel in vivo UTE MRI approach in human tendon for accurate quantification of these chemical shift
resonances showing correspondence with 1H NMR spectra, allowing for direct imaging quantification of matrix
molecules and metabolites. Our team has recently developed a novel pipeline combining in vivo animal
tendon-loading with ex vivo HRMAS NMR for directly studying load-induced metabolic activity in rat tendon.
We are poised to combine detailed tissue explant, animal, and human experiments to establish new chemical
shift-based measurements of ECM structure and functional imaging of load-induced tendon metabolism. In Aim
1, we will validate UTE MRI chemical shift markers of ECM damage and metabolism in tendinopathy using
animal studies, human explant tissue, phantoms, and numerical simulations. In Aim 2, we will establish in-
human UTE-derived chemical shift mapping of load-induced anaerobic metabolism in tendinopathy. This work
will establish new MRI methods for in-human imaging studies to quantitatively investigate the interaction
between ECM damage, in vivo loading, and tendon biological function, to be applied to subsequent studies of
tendinopathy."
10754590,"Increased anabolism is a common feature of tumors and several metabolic diseases. The high anabolic state is
typically accompanied by systemic suppression of catabolism (e.g., lysosome biogenesis and autophagy).
Paradoxically, the anabolic cells increase dependence on the lysosomal degradation pathways to counteract the
obligately increased stresses, such as malfunctioned organelle and reactive oxygen species. However, the
molecular mechanism of how cells activate lysosomal functions regardless of their anabolic state remains largely
unknown. Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase (PI5P4K) is a family of enzymes, consisting of PI5P4Kα, β,
γ, and converts the lipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P), to phosphatidylinositol
4,5-phosphate (PI(4,5)P2). The main function of PI5P4K is considered to control PI5P-dependent signaling, as
the bulk of PI(4,5)P2 is generated from another family of enzymes, PI4P5Ks. Genetic deletion studies of the three
genes in the PI5P4K family (Pip4k2a, Pip4k2b, and Pip4k2c) in mice indicate that PI5P4Kβ plays distinct and
critical roles in mediating cellular responses to stress (e.g., nutrient deprivation, ROS) and ultimately affect
whole-body insulin sensitivity, growth, obesity, and cancer. Importantly, PI5P4Ks are atypical kinases that have
a unique property to use GTP as a phosphodonor. In particular, PI5P4Kβ preferentially uses GTP rather than
ATP, and its kinase activity is regulated by physiological GTP concentrations, acting as a cellular GTP sensor
for metabolism and tumorigenesis by mechanisms yet to be defined. Pertaining to this proposal, our group has
developed isozyme selective PI5P4K inhibitors using newly developed NMR-based screening, and found that
treatment of the PI5P4K inhibitors suppressed lysosome acidification. Newly generated GTP-insensitive
Pip4k2bF205L/F205L mice developed severe steatosis compared to WT mice, and exhibited increased hypoglycemia
upon fasting, resembling the phenotype of autophagy deficiency. We hypothesize that GTP-dependent PI5P4Kβ
activation promotes lysosomal acidification to counterbalance the anabolic stress for stress-resilient cellular
growth and hepatic functions. Capitalizing on our long-standing, productive collaborations with a number of
cutting-edge laboratories, we will define the mechanistic role of PI5P4Kβ in transcriptionally-independent
lysosomal acidification and stress-resilient growth. Using the “structural reverse-genetics” framework that we
have developed recently, we will dissect and determine the role of kinase activity and scaffolding functions of
PI5P4Kβ (Aim 1). We will test the hypothesis that GTP-dependent PI5P4Kβ activity is required for hepatic
lysosomal function and whole-body energy homeostasis (Aim 2). Upon completing the proposed research, we
will identify the novel stress counteracting system through which GTP-mediated activation of PI5P4Kβ promotes
lysosomal activation to support stress-resilient anabolic cell growth and protect mice from the pathogenesis of
metabolic diseases."
10892986,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite decades of research psychiatric disorders continue to be a leading source of disability in the United
States and across the world. A key challenge for those seeking to develop new therapeutics is that by the time
clinical symptoms of mental illness are recognized, much of the underlying pathologic brain development has
already occurred and may be irreversible. Consequently, our best hope of significantly impacting care and out-
comes in these devastating disorders is via prevention and very early intervention, which our proposed research
will help enable, by integrating genomics with longitudinal, pediatric imaging data and behavioral phenotyping to
better understand the developmental origins of mental illness. Our central hypothesis is that genetic variants
associated with psychiatric disorders increase risk by influencing early neurodevelopment and the establishment
of brain circuitry. This hypothesis is supported by several large-scale studies which performed functional genomic
characterization of loci that confer risk for multiple psychiatric disorders and revealed enrichment for genes reg-
ulating nervous system development, as well as innovative studies by our group in which we 1) discovered
variation in putative risk genes for Alzheimer's disease and mental illness are associated with brain changes at
birth, and 2) uncovered new genes and variants implicated in brain development, using GWAS. These findings
were based on cross-sectional data, collected close to birth. To more fully understand how DNA variants influ-
ence brain development in infancy and early childhood, and potential implications for future research and clinical
care, large, longitudinal studies are needed. Our proposed study will meet this need, and test our central hypoth-
esis by 1) harmonizing a rich array of genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral data across 19 large and diverse
infant and pediatric cohorts from the U.S., Europe, South Africa, and Asia (N=6809, most with two or more
longitudinal brain scans and developmentally appropriate measures of impulsivity, anxiety, and aggressive be-
havior); 2) determining how common genetic variants, including those associated with mental illness, influence
developmental imaging phenotypes (DIPs) derived from structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and rest-
ing state fMRI; and 3) identifying relationships between genetically-influenced DIPs and clinically-salient behav-
iors using powerful multivariate analysis methods. Our research team includes world thought-leaders in infant
imaging, genomic approaches to understanding complex traits, and behavioral assessment of infants and young
children, all working together as the Organization for Imaging Genomics of Infancy (ORIGIN). We are also part
of the ENIGMA consortium and will leverage the intellectual resources of this highly successful group. The ap-
plication is innovative in its focus on infancy and early childhood, longitudinal design, and in leveraging a unique
global alliance of researchers to create the largest-ever imaging genomics dataset focused on infancy and early
childhood. The proposed research will have a positive impact because it will enhance our fundamental under-
standing of how genetic factors influence brain development and lay the groundwork for a promising new line of
research focused on early intervention in individuals at high risk for developing a psychiatric disorder."

Once believed to be sterile, recent studies now show microbes inhabiting healthy lungs that are dysregulated in
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, tuberculosis (TB), and SARS-CoV-2
infection. Malnourished patients have an increased risk of respiratory infections and pathogenesis according to
recent studies, indicating a potential link between metabolic status and lung homeostasis. These and other
studies indicate the presence of host-microbe-vitamin A interactions that are present in the lung and influence
the respiratory immune response, however details of whether changes to the lung microbiome is a cause or
consequence of lung pathology, or whether retinoic acid (RA) – the bioactive metabolite of Vitamin A – can
directly influence the lung microbiome in a host-independent manner are largely unknown. We hypothesize that
dietary VAD-induced airway epithelial remodeling promotes microbial dysbiosis in the lung, further
perpetuating respiratory epithelial dysfunction via host-microbe interactions. Aim 1 will determine whether
dietary VAD directly alters metabolic pathways of opportunistic microbes found upregulated in the lower
respiratory tract (LRT) of adult VAD mouse lungs. Our Microscopy core facilities offer state-of-the-art
microscopes designed to capture high-quality fluorescent images that will enable us to identify microbial
composition, protein expression, and localization within the airway (1.1). Using qRT-PCR machines freely
accessible to me in the Pulmonary Center, we will measure changes in relative abundance of the opportunistic
microbes upregulated in VAS and VAD lungs at 3 weeks and 8 weeks post-dietary modulation (1.2). Aim 2 will
determine whether locally-derived vs. distally-derived metabolic changes in the host could influence airway
epithelial remodeling in the lower respiratory tract. We will measure ciliary motility in tracheal explants of VAS
and VAD lungs using a ciliary motility protocol already completed by our laboratory (2.1). We will also investigate
whether microbes have the ability to influence epithelial remodeling and ciliary function independent of host
metabolic status. We aim to expose VAS and VAD tracheal explants to microbes from opposing diets in-vitro
(2.2) and repeat the ciliary motility technique proposed in Aim 1. Our lab’s metatranscriptomic work paired with
the Pulmonary department’s proven expertise in intratracheal viral injections and cell culture techniques makes
this sub-aim easily achievable within the proposed time frame. Aim 3 will identify mechanisms associated with
microbial metabolic functions that are dysregulated in the absence of vitamin A. We will measure RNA transcripts
of our upregulated microbes via qRT-PCR gathered from our explanted tissues mentioned in Aim 2 (3.1). We
will also investigate microbe-microbe and microbe-environment interactions using an in-silico community-based
modeling program called COMETS (3.2), a platform created by our collaborators at the BU Microbiome Initiative.
The results of this work aims to uncover specific host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions in VAD lungs
that are essential for healthy lung function."
10844621,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health concern, affecting more than 1.5 million individuals annually
in the United States. Extracranial multi-organ dysfunction (MODS) occurs in approximately 60% of severe TBI
patients and contributes to secondary brain injuries, increased risk for mortality, and poor functional outcomes
over the year following TBI. Our prior research has demonstrated that the prevalence of early autonomic nervous
system dysfunction is high following severe TBI and associated with cerebral metabolic crisis and MODS
development. Although treatments for autonomic dysfunction following severe TBI are readily available, a
complete characterization of the course of autonomic dysfunction following severe TBI that would be adequate
to guide therapy is lacking. Therefore, a comprehensive characterization of autonomic dysfunction after TBI and
an understanding of how early autonomic dysfunction contributes to episodes of cerebral metabolic crisis and
extracranial organ injury are urgently needed to guide the development of therapies to improve patient outcomes
following TBI. To address this, we propose the following specific aims using unique and granular waveform data
from the BOOST-3 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe TBI Phase 3 trial, U01 NS099946) clinical trial: 1)
Determine the burden of early autonomic dysfunction and its relationship to cerebral metabolic crisis following
severe TBI, 2) Determine the relationship of early autonomic dysfunction with extracranial MODS and functional
neurologic outcomes following severe TBI, and 3) Assess the uniqueness and added value of cardiac waveform
data in predicting risk for MODS and functional neurologic outcomes following severe TBI. Successful completion
of this study will solidify our understanding of the effects of autonomic dysfunction after severe TBI, and inform
trials to determine the impact of modulating autonomic dysfunction on the development of MODS and poor
outcomes following severe TBI. Our long-term goal is to develop strategies to personalize critical care
management in order to improve clinical outcomes after severe TBI in adults."
10754963,"Project Summary/Abstract
Premature senescence-triggered vascular diseases (PmSVD) induced by ionizing radiation (IR), as well
as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), are notably characterized by accelerating processes
of atherosclerosis (AthS) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Although endothelial dysfunction in PmSVDs is well
known, there is a paucity of available treatments to prevent PmSVD-induced CAD; hence, there is an urgent need to
fill this gap. Persistent senescence-associated secretory phenotype (PISP), provoked by TL dysfunction, plays a
central role in cancer recurrence and resistance, but its regulatory mechanisms and contribution to AthS remain
unknown. Our long-term goal is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which PmSVD induces PISP in
endothelial cells (ECs) and CAD. PmSVD significantly up-regulated TOP2β degradation via PKCζ activation. The
depletion of EC TOP2β instigated PARP activation and PISP; it also accelerated AthS. We showed the critical
role of mtROS in PKCζ activation, which is one of the initial steps for the Mt-nucleus feedback loop. Of note, the
crucial role of mtROS in both IR and HGPS has been well established. Lastly, by performing IC-MS analysis in both
IR and HGPS ECs, we also found that the following 3 metabolite-related pathways were regulated in IR and HGPS
ECs in common: 1) nucleotide sugars-glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and sulfate, 2) glutamate, and 3) NAD+-
hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Although the contribution of all 3 metabolites pathways to CAD and aging has been
suggested, the exact role and mechanical insights in regulating PmSVD remain largely unknown. We propose the
novel hypothesis that PmSVD-induced mtROS activates the PKCζ-TOP2β module, followed by TOP2β
degradation, and instigates TL DNA damage. TL DNA damage promotes PARP activation, which induces mt
dysfunction and forms an mt-nucleus feedback loop, resulting in persistent metabolites changes, including
nucleotide sugars and NAD+-H2S pathways, causing PISP and CAD. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing the
following 3 specific aims: In Aim 1, we will determine the role and regulatory mechanisms of the following 3 common
metabolites-related pathways in PmSVD in vitro; 1) nucleotide sugars-GAGs and sulfate, 2) glutamate, 3) NAD+-
H2S. in Aim 2, we will characterize the role of PKCζ-TOP2β module and PARP1 in PmSVD-mediated metabolites
changes and mt dysfunction in vitro. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of the PKCζ-TOP2β module and
subsequent PARP activation in PmSVD-induced coronary AthS (CAthS) in vivo. The proposed work is
expected to establish the roles of PKCζ-TOP2β and PARP as the hub molecules in regulating PmSVD-induced
metabolite changes and PISP. The approach is innovative because we will use the new technologies of iPSC, ion
chromatography-mass spectrometry (IC-MS), machine learning, imaging mass cytometry, and a novel mouse
CAthS model. The proposed research should positively impact PmSVD by leading to a novel approach to
inhibiting PISP."
10843746,"The major -hemoglobinopathies, sickle cell disease (SCD) and -thalassemia, are two of the most common
monogenetic diseases. -thalassemia describes a heterogenous set of mutations, insertions, deletions, or
substitutions of the -globin gene, HBB, that result in no or decreased -globin synthesis. SCD on the other hand
is an autosomal recessive disorder that has a well-defined missense point mutation in the HBB gene, that
changes a glutamic acid to valine residue at the sixth position in the polypeptide sequence. This mutation causes
adult erythroid cells to express s-globin and synthesize an abnormal form of hemoglobin, HbS, that is prone to
polymerizing. Patients with -hemoglobinopathies cannot synthesize normal -globin, and thus cannot form
normally functioning adult hemoglobin, HbA, the predominant form in mature erythroid cells. Elevating levels of
fetal hemoglobin, HbF, in patients with -hemoglobinopathies can alleviate clinical symptoms. Compared to HbA,
which is composed of globin subunits 22, HbF is composed of 22 subunits. After birth, hematopoiesis shifts
from fetal hemoglobin expression in fetal liver to the bone marrow where adult erythrocytes are produced and
express adult hemoglobin. The transition from fetal to adult hemoglobin, from -globin to -globin expression,
requires several critical transcription factors (TFs), namely BCL11A and ZBTB7A, that recruit the Nucleosome
Remodeling and Deacetylase, NuRD, complex, and its catalytic component, CHD4, to the globin locus and
repress -globin expression. A third TF, ZNF410, was recently found to be a unique activator of CHD4
expression. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout or shRNA knockdown of each of these three TFs induces HbF expression,
and targeted therapies against these factors might offer a new therapeutic avenue for -hemoglobinopathies.
Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) have been shown to recruit Cys2-His2 zinc-finger (C2H2-ZF) TFs to cereblon,
the substrate recognition component for the Cullin-4 E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) complex, for targeted protein
degradation. The three TFs of interest all contain various numbers of tandem C2H2-ZF domains, and therefore,
I hypothesize that IMiD-induced targeted protein degradation of one or a combination of BCL11A,
ZBTB7A, or ZNF410, will lead to reactivation of the -globin gene and increase levels of HbF. Using a 1122
compound IMiD library built by the Crews lab, Aim 1 will determine which compounds from the library can serve
as lead hit compounds that will be optimized by iterative rounds of structure-activity relationship studies and
characterized in cellulo for target TF degradation. Aim 2 will examine the ability of these optimized compounds
to reactivate -globin expression and induce HbF synthesis in HUDEP-2 and primary erythroid progenitor cells.
Completion of this proposal will provide the preclinical framework to assess the therapeutic potential of targeted
protein degradation against TFs critical in the -globin to -globin switch as a novel treatment avenue for the
major -hemoglobinopathies."
10982444,"ABSTRACT. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. A major goal of pharmacologic
therapy is to lower plasma lipids, especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), the cardinal risk factor for
coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) have increased risk of
developing early-onset CAD due to dysfunctional clearance of LDL from circulation and increased plasma levels
of this atherogenic lipoprotein. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of FH are exacerbated by limited therapeutic
options. However, one strategy has been successful at lowering LDL in FH patients: Inhibition of the hepatically
secreted protein Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3). A monoclonal antibody (evinacumab) inhibiting
circulating ANGPTL3 recently obtained FDA approval for treatment of FH due to substantial reductions in LDL,
even in patients with complete deficiency of the LDL receptor (LDLR). In contrast, existing lipid-lowering agents
largely rely on LDLR function to remove this atherogenic lipoprotein from the blood. In accordance with the
NHLBI Research Priorities, it is important for researchers to define molecular characteristics that can predict
meaningful or inadequate responses to therapy in different populations with cardiovascular disease. Despite
promising clinical trial data, the LDLR-independent mechanisms by which ANGPTL3 inhibition lowers LDL have
not been fully characterized. This is an important question to address not only to describe how drugs inhibiting
ANGPTL3 work but also to recommend targets for reducing plasma lipids via a novel LDLR-independent pathway
of lipoprotein metabolism. The main hypothesis of this proposal is that ANGPTL3 deficiency lowers LDL in part
by modulating hepatic lipoprotein assembly and lipid metabolism while simultaneously altering characteristics of
secreted VLDL particles. This hypothesis will be addressed by achieving the goals outlined in this proposal. The
proposed experiments employ a combination of hepatocyte cell culture systems, including immortalized cancer
cells and an advanced cell culture model that produces hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) from induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs). These iPSCs are derived from a unique population of human subjects with complete genetic
ANGPTL3 deficiency. Aim 1 will use these models to test whether changes in lipoprotein secretory transit and/or
lipid metabolism contribute to LDL lowering in ANGPTL3 deficiency. Aim 2 will test whether lipoprotein particle
secretion kinetics, clearance, size, and/or lipid composition could also be contributing to LDL lowering. These
experiments will be carried out as part of a rigorous fellowship training plan in a well-resourced and highly
collaborative environment. Consistent with the NHLBI Strategic Plan, the proposed studies will help future
clinician-investigators and the patients they serve by improving understanding of the functions of ANGPTL3-
inhibiting drugs; describing a role for ANGPTL3 in hepatic lipoprotein metabolism; and potentially recommending
new therapeutic targets for lipid-lowering agents by elucidating an LDLR-independent mechanism for clearance
of circulating LDL."
10756132,"We propose to continue a novel, adaptive, secured system for parallel testing of promising interventions
designed to improve outcome after ischemic stroke when compared to reperfusion alone, the Stroke Preclinical
Assessment Network. SPAN will screen and select highly promising candidate interventions for possible study
in StrokeNet. The applicant PI and research team—the SPAN Coordinating Center (CC)—created and
implemented novel solutions to several key barriers impeding successful pre-clinical network implementation.
The result is a highly successful, multi-site network for testing putative cerebroprotectants in animal stroke
models that include equal numbers of females and males and co-morbidities such as aging, hypertension and
hyperglycemia. We invented novel methods of case enrollment and tracking; centralized randomization;
centralized drug preparation/masking/bottling; group concealment from the surgeons; centralized, blinded
behavioral assessment; and centralized, blinded evaluation of MRI scans. Each aspect of SPAN went through
a thorough, organized process: literature review, rounds of debate and re-review, and finally decisions were
made and documented. Using this process, SPAN developed SOPs concerning the choice of animal models,
surgical methods, behavior assessments, assessor training and certification. SPAN uses a Multi-Arm Multi-
Stage design and state-of-the-art experimental rigor to successfully reduce or eliminate common sources of
bias. Stroke is administered and interventions are provided in blind fashion. Outcome data (behavioral tests
and MRI scans) are uploaded by the SPAN Testing Laboratories to a central repository, and then randomly
assigned by the CC to independent raters at other labs. We, the SPAN CC, coordinate, network
communication via daily contact with the sites; weekly enrollment update reports; monthly Steering Committee
meetings; annual investigator meetings; and semi-annual site visits. To improve reproducibility across all labs,
we devised training sessions and certification tests for all surgeons and behavioral raters targeted to specific
tasks, e.g., surgery, recording behavior testing, corner test rating, etc. These training and certification tools will
facilitate rapid, rigorous addition of new Testing Labs in SPAN 2.0. Throughout SPAN 1.0 in fact, all SOPs,
protocols, and infrastructure were designed to facilitate rapid, simple addition of new sites and easy transition
to SPAN 2.0 with minimal down-time. Presently, we are devising innovative enhancements for the next funding
cycle: we are training a machine learning algorithm to score behavior videos to allow rapid, reproducible
scoring using a digital pipeline; we are developing a blood clot/thrombolysis model to allow testing in the
presence of thrombolytics. This present application, if funded, will allow the SPAN CC to continue to improve
and advance preclinical development by implementing critical technical innovations, including novel
assessment tools using machine learning. SPAN 2.0 will continue our track record of successful enrollment
and technical innovation, providing a model for pre-clinical networks in other disease areas."
10834829,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The year after birth, also known as the “fourth trimester”, is a growing focus of efforts to address high rates of
maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States (U.S.), which disproportionally affect racial-ethnic
minorities, rural women and women insured by Medicaid at delivery. More than half of pregnancy-related deaths
occur in the year after delivery and a significant share of women experience postpartum morbidity due to physical
and mental health conditions. As the payer for nearly half of U.S. births and a larger share of births among Black
and Indigenous women, Medicaid is a key lever to improve population-level postpartum health disparities. As
the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, policymakers are considering a range of Medicaid policy changes—alone
and in conjunction with other social policy sectors—aimed to improve postpartum health, such as extending
pregnancy Medicaid one year postpartum or addressing social risk factors. Yet, the determinants of postpartum
wellbeing and health disparities are poorly understood. This is largely because the fourth trimester has been
a neglected focus of maternal health policy and research.
To drive evidence-based policymaking and fill the significant gap in high quality, representative data on
postpartum health, our multidisciplinary team developed a large-scale follow-up survey administered one year
after birth in collaboration with six states and New York City: the Postpartum Assessment of Women Survey
(PAWS). The 2020 PAWS captured the postpartum experience of women who gave birth in 2020, during the
height of the public health emergency (PHE). This proposed project leverages and builds on this first-of-its kind
data collection effort to respond to the urgent needs of policymakers to improve postpartum health in the new
public health, policy and social context that will emerge as the pandemic subsides, as the policies and protections
of the PHE end, and as new policies begin (e.g. postpartum Medicaid extensions in 2022). Specifically, we will
launch a new PAWS survey round following a 2023 birth cohort (data collected in 2024) to measure (1) maternal
health outcome disparities in the postpartum year (by insurance, race-ethnicity, and urban/rural residence), (2)
health care-related disparities and their contribution to disparities in postpartum health outcomes, and (3) social
and economic disparities and their contribution to disparities in postpartum health outcomes.
Drawing on expertise from our diverse, interdisciplinary team of junior and senior investigators, and in deep
collaboration with state and city government partners, we will produce a highly valuable scientific resource
and generate timely, rigorous findings to inform evidence-based policies with the potential to advance
maternal health equity in the U.S."
10788439,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
People living with HIV (PLWH) in rural sub-Saharan Africa are three times less likely to achieve viral
suppression than their urban counterparts. Novel HIV service delivery models for rural PLWH are needed to
improve the HIV continuum of care and achieve viral suppression. Traditional healers (TH) are lay providers
who serve as the first line of healthcare in rural Africa, and frequently provide care to PLWH who have
disengaged from HIV care. TH are accessible, trusted members of rural communities, but have not been
integrated into HIV care programs. Our prior cluster randomized trial demonstrated that partnerships with TH
quadrupled the uptake of HIV testing in rural Uganda through facilitation of HIV counseling and self-testing.
Building on these results, we adapted an evidence-based lay provider intervention for delivery by Ugandan TH
to support subsequent steps of the HIV continuum. The TH-delivered program is called Omuyambi (“Support”
in Runyankole) and includes assisting PLWH to link to care for ART initiation, providing ongoing counseling on
ART adherence, and encouraging retention in clinical care. We conducted a pilot study of this lay provider
program among 12 TH and 20 PLWH who were disengaged from HIV care or ART naïve. Results were
overwhelmingly positive: 100% of PLWH linked to HIV care and initiated ART within 14 days, 95% reported
ART adherence and 100% were retained in care after nine months. Building upon this evidence, we
hypothesize that TH can support clinic-based care and improve viral suppression among rural PLWH. We
will conduct a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness
of the Omuyambi intervention on viral suppression among ART naïve/defaulted PLWH in Uganda.
• Aim 1: Compare the Omuyambi intervention versus routine HIV clinic-based care (control) in a cluster
randomized trial. Forty TH clusters that include ≥650 PLWH will be randomized to the Omuyambi intervention
or to a control arm, in which TH will refer PLWH to clinic-based HIV care alone. Primary clinical outcome is
viral suppression at 12 months measured via dried blood spot analysis. We hypothesize that 80% of PLWH in
the intervention arm will achieve viral suppression, compared with 60% in the control arm.
• Aim 2: Evaluate implementation of Omuyambi using a convergent mixed methods study design and the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Qualitative and quantitative data will be
collected from participating TH, PLWH, HIV clinic staff, and Ministry of Health Officials. These data will be used
to assess Omuyambi implementation determinants and outcomes.
The proposed research is significant as it responds to the World Health Organization and Ugandan Ministry of
Health calls for community-based interventions to improve HIV viral suppression where current programs
have suboptimal impact. If effective, this approach has the potential to improve the HIV continuum among rural
PLWH towards UNAIDS 95-95-95 benchmarks necessary to end the HIV epidemic."
10845518,"ABSTRACT
Spirochetes are a phylogenetically distinct group of bacteria that are of significant importance in human health
as they cause major diseases such as syphilis (Treponema pallidum), Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi),
leptospirosis (Leptospira interrogans), and periodontitis (Treponema spp.). To infect and disseminate in
mammalian hosts, spirochetes have evolved a unique morphology and motility that is highly effective at
translocating through viscous media and tissue barriers. The organelles essential for spirochetal motility
are periplasmic flagella, which reside in the bacterial periplasmic space and are distinct from the external
flagella in the model systems Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Given that flagella-driven motility is
crucial for virulence of pathogenic spirochetes and many other bacteria, our long-term goal is to understand
molecular mechanisms underlying flagellar assembly and function. During the previous funding period, we have
demonstrated that the Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi (Bb) is a great model system for characterizing
periplasmic flagella in situ at an unprecedented resolution. In collaboration with Drs. Md Motaleb and Chunhao
Li, we have generated and characterized a large Bb library including 60 different flagellar and chemotaxis
mutants. Significant progress has been made in understanding the periplasmic flagella and their remarkable
capacity in driving the unique spirochetal motility and morphology. The objective of this application is to illuminate
three fundamental but challenging aspects of the periplasmic flagella: 1) the structure and function of the flagellar
type III secretion apparatus; 2) the mechanism underlying the flagellar rotation driven by proton motive force
across membrane; and 3) the mechanisms by which flagella switch rotational directions to control the motility
and chemotaxis. Together with genetic and biochemical approaches, cryo-ET will be utilized to determine the
structure/function relationship of the spirochetal flagellar motor in a native cellular environment at nanometer
resolution."
10832576,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We seek continued funding for an interdisciplinary training program focused on Neurodevelopmental Disabilities
(NDD). Based at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and University of Pennsylvania (Penn), this
program is integrated into the CHOP/Penn Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center and
broader CHOP/Penn neuroscience community. The goal of the Program is to train MD and PhD fellows in
research focused on NDDs. There are three reasons for this focus. First, NDDs are common; ~10% of U.S.
households live with an individual who has an NDD. These households bear significant and often lifelong
financial cost and emotional impact. Second, NDDs have diverse causes — from genetic to acquired — that
alter brain development, circuitry, and behavior. Understanding how these causes lead to the various NDDs will
yield treatments for what are currently untreatable disorders. Third, the symptoms of the various NDDs are
broad and impact all aspects of brain function, requiring interdisciplinary investigation. Training researchers to
improve our understanding of NDDs and ultimately develop treatments will improve outcomes and quality of lives
for individuals with NDDs and their families. Hence, we request continued support for 6 postdoctoral fellows/year
who participate in a program designed to be three years in length. This number of trainees allows us to maintain
a critical mass to support a diverse trainee pool that can learn from each other and is easily justified by the many
outstanding applicants. In the labs of our 29 faculty mentors, trainees use state-of-the-art genetic,
cellular/molecular, behavioral, physiologic, and structural/dynamic imaging techniques to pursue basic and
translational research relevant to NDDs. While the main Program focus is this mentored research training, the
trainees (and their mentors) also regularly meet for activities that develop oral and written communication skills
and encourage exchange of scientific information. They also work with the Program Statistician to build a strong
foundation in quantitative skills and fluency. The Program Directors help trainees develop customized plans to
reach their research and career goals. Our past trainees are now leaders in NDD research across the country.
In the last 15 years, 38 trainees came into the Program with a degree of MD (1), MD/PhD (5), DMV/PhD (1), or
PhD (31). Twenty-four (63%) of these trainees are female and 10 (26%) of these trainees are from groups
historically-excluded from biomedical science and research. Thirty-two different NDD T32 mentors have
supervised these trainees. The 32 trainees who completed both T32 support and postdoc training since 2007
are now faculty members (14 Asst/Assoc Prof), scientists in academia (1 Instruct., 2 Res Assoc.), pharma/biotech
(9), and at a non-profit (1), scientific writers (2) and clinicians (2), and one is the CHOP Assoc. Director of
Diversity. This T32 combines the outstanding CHOP/Penn training environment, an exceptional cadre of
trainees and mentors, an experienced multi-PI team, and rich institutional resources for NDD research and
training to fuel a true ‘bench to bedside’ approach to translational research."

The proportion of Americans over the age of 65 is expected to increase over the next few decades and the
number of those afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is also expected to increase
substantially. To adequately serve this growing population, we need to make considerable progress in
understanding ADRD and in developing evidence-based practices for prevention and care. As the US
population ages, it is also becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. Despite this fact, the racial and
ethnic diversity of those focusing on ADRD research does not reflect the diversity of the population that bears
the high burden of ADRD. This is problematic, as the ability to be responsive to ADRD needs of such a
population will require culturally informed approaches and diverse investigators with appropriate knowledge
and skills. Information about and opportunities to enter the ADRD research workforce are not equally available
to all, which may be why few students from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds pursue graduate study or
careers in this area. In order to address these issues, we propose to establish a summer program and
mentorship network that expands the pipeline of students from underrepresented groups who decide to pursue
graduate study and, ultimately, careers in ADRD-related research areas. The proposed program will be jointly
administered by two world-class research institutions in two of the nation’s biomedical and public health
research hubs: George Washington University (GWU) in Washington, DC and Boston University (BU) in
Boston, MA. Faculty from GWU’s Institute for Brain Health and Dementia will work in collaboration with faculty
from BU’s Framingham Heart Study Brain Aging Program (FHSBAP) to mentor program participants as they
work on ADRD-related research projects. The program will provide structured and suitably-tailored didactic,
research, and social experiences for participants that will serve to elicit and magnify interest in ADRD research,
develop skills that will make them competitive applicants for graduate study, and provide a network of mentors
who will engage with them as they navigate the path from undergraduate to graduate study."
10877017,"Summary
Diabetes mellitus is an epidemic and a major cause of blindness, kidney disease, amputation and cardiovascular
disease around the world. Other endocrinologic and metabolic diseases also have major implications for public
health. We urgently need to train patient- and population-oriented researchers to provide an evidence base for
the optimal prevention and treatment of these conditions. Researchers need methodologic training and skills in
chronic disease epidemiology, clinical trials, health services delivery and implementation science to improve
health equity and health outcomes. For the past 20 years, our T32-supported training program has played an
essential role in training the next generation of patient- and population-oriented researchers in diabetes,
endocrinology, and metabolism. Since its inception, we have successfully trained 25 pre-doctoral and 25 post-
doctoral scholars, who have authored 212 peer-reviewed papers during training. Many of these former trainees
now hold research positions across the country with NIH-funded research programs (see Progress Report). We
have trained 12 individuals underrepresented in science and medicine and 23 women. At Johns Hopkins there
is increasing breadth and depth of endocrinology and diabetes research across schools and departments,
particularly with newly funded interdisciplinary programs focused on cardiometabolic health equity and diabetes
management and prevention. In this next cycle we propose to unite this research training into single program to
promote multidisciplinary collaboration and thereby better address the real-world challenges facing our
communities. We propose to double the number of mentors from across the institution, providing diverse
expertise in multiple research areas in diabetes and endocrinology, with a particular emphasis on diabetes,
diabetes prevention and metabolic disease throughout the life course, health disparities and equity, and special
populations disproportionately affected by diabetes and endocrine diseases (e.g., persons with mental health
disorders, cystic fibrosis, and HIV). The vast research resources available at Johns Hopkins will support the
training of additional fellows. We plan to recruit diverse trainees in adult and pediatric endocrinology, General
Internal Medicine (post-docs) and public health or epidemiology (pre-docs) from a national pool of applicants;
provide a rigorous training experience in patient-oriented and epidemiologic research in diabetes, endocrinology
and metabolism; utilize existing data from well-characterized cohorts and trials to enable trainee projects to be
rapidly executed; engage trainees in high caliber collaborative research to address important questions and test
meaningful hypotheses under the supervision of nationally renowned, multidisciplinary faculty; integrate multi-
layered mentorship for each trainee to develop scholarship and an investigative career; evaluate the outcomes
of the program and make modifications to maximize its success. We will demonstrate our impact through training
and developing the careers of exceptional clinical and epidemiologic academic researchers committed to the
prevention and management of diabetes and other endocrinologic and metabolic health conditions."

intends to: 1) increase the number of fellowship-supported UG students committed to finishing a
Bachelor’s Thesis 2) increase the number of underrepresented groups in research through
engagement in self-directed learning-based research experiences, 3) retain trainees for the 3 year
training period and graduate within the predicted time to graduation 4) foster science and
engineering identity through asset-based individualized research experiences, 5) increase the
number of students who choose to pursue a research-focused higher degree program in a
biomedical field, and 6) enhance the visibility and competitiveness of NJIT trainees in the
biomedical field. Our overall training approach will be based on the Staged Self-Directed Learning
model as a framework for a structured training program to assist students to grow into self-directed
learners. The program comprises didactic training, career development activities, individualized
mentorship, and two semesters of research for credit culminating in an undergraduate thesis and
scientific dissemination. As an urban technological university serving one of the most ethnically
diverse populations in the country, we hope to utilize this training program to prepare a competitive
cohort of undergraduate students who, as future scientists and engineers, would help diversify
the field of biomedical research."
10836380,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Superoxide is a toxic molecule that all organisms exposed to oxygen must cope with. This is particularly true for
pathogenic microbes, as the host harnesses the toxic properties of superoxide to combat invaders via the
oxidative burst. To detoxify superoxide, nearly all forms of life, including strict anaerobes, produce superoxide
dismutase (SOD). Convergent evolution has led to the development of three independent SOD families, all of
which are dependent on metals for function. The most widely distributed family of SODs are those which depend
on iron (Fe) or manganese (Mn) for function. Members of the Fe/Mn superfamily are present in eukaryotes,
archaea, and bacteria. Despite over forty years of study, it is not possible to predict accurately the metal utilized
by members of the Fe/Mn superfamily of SODs. Difficulties in predicting metalloprotein metal utilization are not
confined to the Fe/Mn SOD superfamily but also occur with other classes of metalloenzymes. This deficiency is
driven by relatively low levels of protein sequence identity amongst SODs from different organisms that utilize
the same metal cofactor. Additionally, the environmental and molecular factors that dictate the metal used by
members of this protein superfamily are also unknown. Members of the Fe/Mn SOD superfamily are canonically
thought to use either Fe or Mn, but not both, as a cofactor. This idea arose despite early investigations that
identified Fe/Mn SOD family members that are active with both Fe and Mn. The ability of these “cambialistic”
SODs (able to use either Fe or Mn as a catalytic cofactor) was dismissed as a quirk of chemistry. At the time, it
was thought that intracellular metal concentrations did not change enough to alter the metal bound by a SOD.
S. aureus possesses two superoxide dismutases, SodA and SodM, which are ~75% identical. Initially, both
SODs were reported to be Mn-dependent. During infection, the host restricts the availability of Mn and inactivates
Mn-dependent SODs via the Mn-binding immune protein calprotectin. Recent work discovered that SodM
critically contributes to the ability of S. aureus to maintain a defense against oxidative stress when Mn-starved,
both in culture and during infection, while SodA is important when Mn is freely available. Biochemical analyses
revealed that SodM is not strictly Mn-dependent but is instead cambialistic, and the ability to use Fe enables it
to promote resistance to oxidative stress when S. aureus is Mn-limited by the host. These observations support
a physiological role for cambialism and the hypothesis that metal availability shapes the repertoire of SODs
possessed by an organism. The experiments in this proposal will evaluate this hypothesis and elucidate the
molecular features that dictate metal utilization in the Fe/Mn SOD superfamily. Aim I: Elucidate the molecular
features that dictate metal utilization of Fe/Mn SOD superfamily members. Aim II: Determine if environmental
metal availability promotes retention of a metal-specific and cambialistic SOD by S. aureus. Aim III: Elucidate
the broader contribution of cambialistic SODs to maintaining a defense against superoxide."

 The University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC), in partnership with four well-established community
groups—People’s Advocacy Institute, Strong Arms of JXN, Operation Good, and the Mississippi Public Health
Institute—propose to participate in the Community Level Interventions for Firearm and Related Violence, Injury
and Mortality Prevention (CLIF-VP) Research Network by establishing the Mississippi Violence Injury
Prevention (VIP) Program. Together, individual team members represent community activists and several
academic disciplines, including emergency medicine, psychology, public health, survey research, GIS and
remote sensing, law, and nursing.
 Mississippi had the nation’s highest firearm mortality rate in 2020 at 28.6 per 100,000 residents. Jackson,
the state’s capital, had a 2021 homicide rate of 97.6 per 100,000 residents, more than three times higher than
the state and 15 times higher than the national rate of 6.5 murders per 100,000 residents. UMMC, which is the
only Level 1 Trauma Center in the state, administered care to 1,129 patients presenting with injuries from
firearms or related violence.
 As part of the CLIF-VP Research Network, the Mississippi VIP Program will work closely with its
Coordinating Center, the other Research Projects funded through this Agreement, the CLIF-VP Research
Network’s Stakeholder Board(s), Steering Committee, and workgroups to successfully carry out cross-project
activities.
 The Mississippi VIP Program’s research design includes a two-year planning (UG3) phase and a three-
year implementation (UH3) phase. Two specific aims have been identified for the UG3 phase: (1) define
and create the machinery to longitudinally monitor the community-level social determinants of firearm injury in
the greater Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan area with respect to (a) perceived needs, (b) available resources
and their utilization, and (c) opportunities for capacity building; and (2) identify principal community-specific risk
elements for (a) firearm injury, (b) suboptimal functional recovery, and (c) retaliation and reinjury, and
collaboratively develop linked community- and hospital-based protective resources to address these risks.
 Two specific aims have been identified for the UH3 phase: (1) conduct a clinical trial that implements
optimized community-focused interventions during the UG3 phase using a step-wedge cluster approach, and
measures longitudinal community and individual impact of violence prevention interventions on (a) incidence of
firearm injury, (b) functional victim recovery, (c) incidence of retaliation and reinjury, and (d) economic impact;
and (2) coordinate ongoing community, regional, and telehealth expansion and adoption of optimized
community-focused resources in concert with the CLIF-VP Research Network."
10832461,"Project Summary
Endothelial cells line the wall of all blood vessels and regulate a wide variety of functions, including contractility
and systemic blood pressure. Endothelial cell dysfunction is a hallmark of several cardiovascular diseases, but
pathological mechanisms involved are unclear. Endothelial cells express small-conductance calcium-activated
potassium (SK3) channels, which regulate contractility. Currents (I) generated by SK3 channels in endothelial
cells is the product of the number of channels (N), their open probability (PO) and amplitude (i), such that
I=N.PO.i. Previous studies have focused on identifying mechanisms that regulate the activity of surface SK
channels in endothelial cells. In contrast, mechanisms that control the number (N) of surface SK3 channels in
endothelial cells are poorly understood. Importantly, it is unclear whether physiological stimuli regulate the
abundance of surface SK3 channels to alter arterial contractility. Similarly uncertain is if pathological alterations
in the control of surface SK3 channel abundance occurs during hypertension, leading to attenuated
vasodilation. Using a wide variety of approaches, we provide evidence that vasodilator stimuli activate
trafficking mechanisms that rapidly increase surface SK3 channel abundance in endothelial cells to induce
vasodilation. Preliminary data also suggest that SK3 channel trafficking is dysfunctional during hypertension,
which attenuates this vasodilatory signaling mechanism. In this proposal, we will investigate three specific
aims. Aim 1 will investigate signaling mechanisms by which physiological stimuli alter the surface abundance
of SK3 channels and examine their functional significance. Aim 2 will examine trafficking mechanisms that
control surface SK3 channels in endothelial cells to modify arterial contractility. Aim 3 will study the hypothesis
that hypertension is associated with pathological alterations in SK3 channel trafficking in endothelial cells that
inhibit vasodilation by these proteins. Methods used will include biotinylation, Western blotting, FRET, RNAi,
co-IP, immunofluorescence, super-resolution microscopy, patch-clamp electrophysiology, membrane potential
recording, intracellular Ca2+ imaging, arterial myography, blood pressure telemetry and transgenic mice. This
project will provide significant novel information concerning vasoregulation by SK3 channel trafficking in
endothelial cells."
10821407,"Project Summary
Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are T cells that form one of the key branches of the mucosal immune
system, providing a first line of immune defense against pathogens and possibly against epithelial cancers due
to their location at the critical interface between the intestinal lumen and the core of the body. Consistently,
dysregulation of IELs leads to loss of mucosal barrier integrity, susceptibility to enteric infections and
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and cancer. In recent years some of the mechanisms controlling the
development and function of IEL populations against enteric pathogens have been elucidated, including work
developed during the first funding cycle of this proposal. In addition to their role in immune surveillance against
enteric infections, recent data suggest a γδ T cell-associated gene signature as the most favorable prognostic
factor across cancer types, including colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC is the second most deadly cancer in the
United States, affecting over 140,000 people each year, killing approximately 50,000 in the US. Up to 20% of
IBD patients develop CRC, although the majority of CRCs develop in patients without underlying inflammation.
In both the common forms of CRC and IBD-induced CRC tumor-elicited inflammation triggers EC damage
resulting in microbial invasion, which sustains inflammation that in turn drives cancer progression. Therefore,
IEL surveillance of the mucosal barrier may play dual roles in CRC: (i) prevention of CRC progression and early
dissemination by immune cell-mediated killing or additional anti-tumor responses; (ii) promotion of CRC
progression and metastasis through inflammatory cytokines or immune-regulatory molecules. Based on existing
literature in murine and human CRC, our recent work, and extensive preliminary data presented here, we
hypothesize that γδ IEL epithelial surveillance is crucial for the regulation of tumor formation. We show that at
steady state, the majority of intestinal γδ IELs express Vγ7 or Vγ1 TCRs and IEL hallmarks including a cytotoxic
machinery. However, in both colitis-associated (AOM+DSS) and mutation-associated (CDX2-APC) models,
CRC progression was associated with relative reduction of Vγ7 or Vγ1+ and accumulation of γδ IELs expressing
Vγ6 or Vγ4 TCRs, which produce IL-17 and express PD-1. In Aim 1, we will address whether tissue-resident Vγ7+
or Vγ1+ γδ IEL subsets play a role in immune surveillance of the epithelium, preventing tumor formation. In Aim
2, we will characterize γδ IEL subsets that accumulate during CRC progression and may facilitate tumor growth.
Studies proposed here will characterize γδ IEL behavior during early and late stages of CRC development using
a combination of innovative imaging approaches. We will also track interacting ECs and surrounding IELs during
CRC using a novel mouse model to identify cellular partners and single cell transcriptomics. Inducible
intersectional genetics will be used to target differentiation or function of γδ IELs, while γδ IEL subsets enriched
in different stages of CRC will be targeted using novel strains lacking specific V-gamma; these murine lines will
be subjected to gnotobiotic and infection models using complementary CRC approaches."

Defects in craniofacial bones of the skull occur congenitally, after high-energy impacts, and during the course of
treatment for stroke and cancer. Autologous bone or alloplastic implants are the current gold-standards for
surgical reconstruction. However, limited quantities and time-intensive intraoperative fitting of autologous bone,
the non-regenerative nature of alloplastic implants, and surgical challenges that stem from irregular defect
margins and the quality of the surrounding bone all contribute to poor healing and high complication rates. A
biomaterial that could be shaped precisely and quickly like an alloplastic implant but that works in a regenerative
fashion like autologous bone would be transformative for craniofacial reconstruction. The objective of this
proposal is to potentiate regeneration of the structure, composition, and mechanical properties of craniofacial
bone using an innovative scaffold-mesh composite biomaterial. We have generated extensive proof-of-principle
data for a surgically-practical composite biomaterial for craniofacial bone regeneration. Our core technology is a
porous mineralized collagen scaffold to expand MSCs in vivo. We have identified microstructural features of this
material to activate mechanotransduction and BMP receptor signaling to accelerate MSC osteogenicity and
secretion of osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble glycoprotein and endogenous inhibitor of osteoclast activity. As a
result, this material increases osteogenicity and transiently inhibits osteoclast activity to accelerate regenerative
healing of craniofacial bone defects osteogenic supplements or exogenously-seeded stem cells. We have
independently developed a millimeter-scale polymeric mesh that can be integrated into the scaffold, à la rebar
in concrete, to form a modular composite that can be shaped intraoperatively to conformally fit irregular defects.
Excitingly, prototype scaffold-mesh composites generated using a mesh printed from an advanced Hyperelastic
Bone® material increases MSC OPG secretion. These findings suggest the exciting possibility to co-optimize
scaffold microstructural properties as well as the composition and architecture of the integrated polymer mesh
to both passively aid surgical-practicality and actively accelerate regenerative healing. Our central hypothesis is
that a multi-scale scaffold-mesh composite will accelerate MSC recruitment and retention, increase osteogenesis
while inhibiting osteoclast activity, and facilitate vascular remodeling to improve regeneration. To do this we will
first define the contribution of scaffold anisotropy on the recruitment and activity of osteoprogenitors and
endothelial cells (Aim 1). We will establish topology parameters of a scalable mesh to aid surgical practicality
and regenerative potential (Aim 2). Lastly, we will demonstrate in vivo efficacy of a scaffold-mesh composite in
a confined calvarial defect model (Aim 3). Our unified effort to develop craniofacial regenerative technologies
will generate significant preclinical data to support an FDA IDE application essential for accelerating this
technology towards clinical use as a material-only regenerative therapy for craniofacial bone injuries."
10835858,"In this competing renewal of R01MH108578, we are seeking to extend findings from the initial study to
focus on effects of stress in longitudinal mood and cognitive outcomes of late-life depression (LLD) and to
examine stress effects on brain structure and function in LLD. Severe or persistent stressors can result in a
number of behavioral and mood changes, including anxiety, dysphoric mood, sleep disruption, altered appetite,
and withdrawal from social and pleasurable activities. These stress-related consequences are particularly
salient when considering longitudinal outcomes of treated LLD. They may be compounded by an individual's
longstanding maladaptive patterns of response to stress, embodied in the construct of neuroticism, which we
have shown to be related to poor mood and cognitive LLD outcomes. Moreover, Andreescu et al. (2019)
introduced a model of depression recurrence that incorporates the homeostatic disequilibrium hypothesis,
which proposes that in geriatric remitted depression, neural networks are in fragile homeostasis that is
threatened by stress exposure. Networks of particular importance in stress of LLD outcome are the Default
Mode Network (DMN), Salience Network (SN) and Executive Control Network (ECN).
 The Neurobiology of Late Life Depression (NBOLD) study began enrolling older depressed and never-
depressed controls in 2013, enrolling 132 depressed and 44 controls, and currently follows 77 depressed and
22 controls. Subjects are well characterized in terms of mood, cognition, personality and stress (including
specific measures obtained during the present COVID pandemic). It is well suited to examine stress effects on
longitudinal mood and cognitive outcomes. For the renewal, we will follow current subjects and recruit 75 new
subjects, who will be followed for up to 5 years with annual cognitive testing, stress measures and baseline
and two-year brain fMRI scan. In preliminary data presented in this application, we show that:
1) In depressed elders, compared with those who developed cognitive decline/dementia in 4 years, those who
 remained cognitively normal had greater 2-year decrease in neuroticism and increase in Conscientiousness.
2) Worsening in stress over two years is associated with two-year decrease in hippocampal volume and is
 associated with changes in functional connectivity of key brain regions..
3) In complex statistical modeling, interactions of changes in neuroticism and changes in the number of
 stressors recently experienced are associated with cognitive outcome.
In this competing renewal, we will examine the following specific aims:
1. To study effects of stressors (obtained on a variety of measures) and neuroticism on longitudinal mood and
 cognitive outcomes in older adults with history of major depressive disorder (MDD).
2. To study effects of stress and neuroticism on brain structure and function in older adults with MDD history.
3. To explore relationships among variables in Aims 1 and 2 with longitudinal multivariable statistical models."
10815878,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) is a breakthrough framework for understanding the etiology of mental
disorders, but it has no clinical traction at present. Of the RDoC units of analysis, self-report measures can be
most feasibly implemented in a clinic, but many self-reports for RDoC’s Negative Valence Systems (NVS)
constructs have psychometric shortcomings and lack normative data. We seek to develop psychometrically
sound, brief, and validated self-report measures (questionnaires and interviews) of each NVS construct with
strong normative data. We will investigate linkages of these self-report measures to other RDoC units of
analyses (behavior, task performance, and psychophysiology) to identify self-reports that align with NVS
dimensions most strongly and specifically. Also, we will fully characterize clinical manifestations of NVS
constructs using a comprehensive dimensional system of symptoms, maladaptive traits, and behaviors
(Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology; HiTOP). The direct counterpart of NVS is internalizing
psychopathology, which HiTOP describes with high resolution using 36 specific dimensions. Measure
development will be carried out in 2 successive phases, each including a sample of (a) 400 outpatients in
psychiatric clinics and (b) 600 community-dwellers. Participants will be adults selected to be representative of
the US adult population in terms of age, sex, and ethnicity to obtain strong normative data. In Phase 3, we will
validate self-report measures against physiology, task performance, and behavior markers of NVS aligned with
the RDoC matrix in a new sample of 300 community adults and 300 psychiatric outpatients. We also will study
the longitudinal validity of all new measures over a one-year interval. To facilitate rapid and ethnically diverse
data collection, three recruitment sites—Buffalo NY, Stony Brook NY, and Dallas/Denton TX—are proposed.
The proposed research will provide a comprehensive catalogue of self-reported characteristics linked to NVS.
This will produce stronger measures of NVS constructs and a cross-walk to their clinical manifestations, which
will enable clinical translation of NVS. The resulting instruments will be normed, reliable, and highly efficient,
and thus scalable to mobile monitoring, screening, and self-administration at population level and clinically.
The rigorous and systematic linkage between RDoC NVS constructs and HiTOP internalizing dimensions will
be the first step to bringing RDoC and HiTOP together into a unified and evidence-based nosology that
integrates etiologic and clinical characterizations of patients."

Over 13 million people develop acute kidney injury (AKI) each year. AKI increases the risk of incident chronic
kidney disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death. Fluid removal (ultrafiltration) is an important component
of managing dialysis-requiring AKI (AKI-D), but safe achievement of optimal volume status involves a delicate
balance between preventing fluid overload and avoiding circulatory compromise. Acuity of illness and comorbid
conditions render patients with AKI highly susceptible to even modest hemodynamic changes, and routine
blood pressure monitoring may be inadequate to detect subtle, yet clinically meaningful, perfusion changes
during hemodialysis. Continuous monitoring of systemic or local tissue perfusion is feasible using a variety of
near-infrared optical technologies, but there has been limited application of these devices during hemodialysis
particularly in the setting of AKI. The overarching premise of this proposal is that optimizing fluid management
in an already vulnerable AKI population requires (1) a marker that captures an individualized hemodynamic
response to fluid removal throughout hemodialysis treatments, and (2) more sensitive techniques to detect
hypoperfusion. Funded by an F32 award, Dr. Wang previously leveraged continuous hematocrit monitoring
(CHM) during maintenance hemodialysis treatments to calculate a semi-instantaneous plasma refill rate
(PRR), which refers to the rate of refilling of the vascular space from the interstitial space during ultrafiltration.
Through this K23 proposal, Dr. Wang will extend her investigations of PRR to the AKI setting and will evaluate
novel approaches to assessing perfusion during hemodialysis. Specifically, Dr. Wang will perform mediation
analysis using data from a large cohort of patients on maintenance hemodialysis to determine whether PRR
mediates the effects of treatment-related factors on intradialytic hypotension (Aim 1); and, in a prospective
cohort of patients with AKI-D, she will combine continuous hematocrit monitoring with two noninvasive
techniques – diffuse correlation spectroscopy and diffuse optic spectroscopy ‒ to simultaneously measure
changes in systemic perfusion (Aim 2) and cerebral perfusion and oxygenation (Aim 3) as a novel approach to
elucidate the physiology underlying both overt and subtle hemodynamic effects of hemodialysis. Additionally,
she will use bedside testing to link spatiotemporal changes in tissue physiology with changes in cognitive
function. To conduct this work, Dr. Wang will utilize the formal methodologic training and practical experience
in epidemiology, study design, and longitudinal analysis that she acquired through the Master of Science in
Clinical Epidemiology Program. Through her K23 career development plan, she will gain (1) skills in designing
and implementing prospective studies in dialysis, (2) experience studying outcomes in acute care, and (3)
expertise in advanced methods for analyzing multidimensional data. Upon completion of this work, Dr. Wang
will be well-positioned to obtain R01 funding to continue working toward her long-term goal of developing novel
approaches that will increase the precision of renal replacement therapy and improve patient outcomes."

Bile acids (BAs) have recently emerged as metabolic regulators in obesity and type 2 diabetes. We discovered
that the BA overload in farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) double knockout mice
unexpectedly exerts anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects. Intriguingly, liver-specific FXR/SHP ablation
phenocopies the global knockout mice with striking beneficial impacts on white adipose tissue (WAT) fatty acid
utilization and inflammation. This raises the possibility that hepatic BA overload confers metabolic crosstalk
between the liver and adipose tissues. Our preliminary results indicate that hepatic secretion of orosomucoid 2
(ORM2) is dramatically increased by not only BA overload, but also weight-loss Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB)
surgery. Hepatic Orm2 overexpression greatly reduces white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, coupled with marked
improvement in whole-body insulin sensitivity. Importantly, ORM2 dampens proinflammatory interferon-gamma
(IFNγ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling in WAT. These exciting data
support the hypothesis that the hepatokine ORM2 exerts anti-inflammatory effects in WAT, which improves
insulin sensitivity. The goal of this proposal is to critically test our hypothesis by challenging mouse models of
ORM2 expression with various metabolic interventions. In Aim 1, we will determine the metabolic impact of
hepatic ORM2 induction on WAT function in mouse models of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim 2 will determine
the contribution of ORM2 to the broad beneficial effects of BA overload and RYGB surgery using Orm2-deficient
mice. Lastly, Aim 3 will define anti-inflammatory effects of ORM2 on CCR5-IFNγ-STAT1 axis in WAT. Our studies
will identify the molecular and cellular basis of hepatokine ORM2 function on WAT inflammation, which
coordinately improves metabolic phenotypes. Ultimately, we expect to provide detailed insight into BA-induced
liver-adipose tissue crosstalk with direct therapeutic potential for treating obesity and type 2 diabetes."
10843738,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The utilization of tumor antigens, which are antigenic peptides expressed in cancer cells as a result of random
somatic mutations, for the development of patient-specific therapeutic cancer vaccines has been an area of
intense interest. However, significant challenges remain in safely and efficiently delivering subunit vaccine
components for the elicitation of robust antitumor immune responses. To overcome these challenges, this
proposal utilizes a new methodology for protecting active peptides from proteolysis for the sustained delivery of
tumor antigens in conjunction with immunomodulatory compounds as rationally designed cancer vaccines. This
approach packages peptides together as high-density brush polymers, which results in the introduction of unique
characteristics with significant advantages over conventional attempts to utilize peptides as therapeutics. These
include increased resistance to proteolysis and improved pharmacokinetic profiles, while maintaining strong
bioactivity and cell uptake. This peptide packaging method is termed Protein-Like Polymers (PLPs) due to its
globular, peptide-based structure assembled around a hydrophobic synthetic polymer core, displaying active
amino acids for recognition and function in a sequence-controlled manner. PLPs are modular in terms of payload,
able to be conjugated with defined proportions of peptides, small molecules, and nucleic acids. Further
modifications of PLPs can confer additional properties including tissue targeting, site-specific cargo release, and
changes in packing density. The PLP nanoplatform demonstrates that compounds arranged in unique 3-
dimensional structures exhibit properties exclusive to that configuration, providing new avenues for biomolecule
delivery. For this proposal, PLPs will be used to overcome inherent difficulties associated with utilizing tumor
antigens as cancer vaccines, namely by preventing their degradation, enabling targeted delivery, and allowing
proportion-defined multivalent display of dissimilar antigens with immunostimulatory compounds."
10762456,"The number of physician scientists, in both adult and pediatric medicine, is declining despite an overall
increase the total number of physicians. Without a substantial increase the pool of early stage physicians
interested in embarking on a research career, the shortfall of successful physician scientists will worsen.
Although the reasons are complex and are in part because of the increasing challenge of sustaining a successful
research career, an identified and possibly remediable cause is the high attrition rate of potential research
capable physicians at the residency stage of training. We now propose a University of Cincinnati (UC)-StARR
program focused on identifying internal medicine residents with an interest in a research career. Once identified,
we will mentor them through a flexible combined didactic and research experience that places them in a
competitive position to pursue a successful physician-scientist career. The overall goal is to increase the pipeline
of internal residents earmarked for research-oriented academic careers. We will complement programs that we
already have in place at that are primarily focused on fellowship level training.
 We propose the following: 1) establish a cadre of well-funded NHLBI investigators from the University of
Cincinnati College of Medicine and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center experienced in training
physician scientists in standard disciplines and peds-to-adult transition medicine, 2) recruit high quality resident-
investigators from of a pool of qualified and diverse candidates within our internal medicine residency program,
3) implement a unique curriculum that caters to the residents’ different prior experience to complement our
existing programs; this will include online courses and a three month elective/workshop during the first half of
PGY2 year followed by formal course work during PGY3 year that concludes with a dedicated Research Block
during the PGY3 year, and 4) implement an individualized resident-investigator development plan and then
evaluate and ensure success by engaging in a validated, state-of-the-art, and real time learning based online
evaluation system.
 In summary, UC-StARR will build upon existing programmatic infrastructure to that brings together 18
experienced, well-funded mentors within the fields of cardiovascular, pulmonary and critical care medicine. The
proposal is innovative because we are coupling this not only with our validated and nationally recognized system
that enhances resident learning and tracks outcomes but also with our existing largely fellow-focused research
investments. The combination of catering to the special needs of residents and training them in a logical
sequence on the principles of research is likely to have a significant impact on increasing the number of Internal
Medicine physician-scientists being trained at UC. We would expect that this model, if further validated, could
serve as readily implemented template for other Internal Medicine residency programs."

The research plan is focused on JAK-STAT pathway in Celiac Disease (CeD), but the training plan includes
extensive didactics in human subject research, bioinformatics and laboratory-based training on T cell
immunology. CeD is an immune mediated gastrointestinal disease that arises in patients with a permissive
HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8 genetic background. The only available treatment for CeD is to follow a gluten-free diet.
Patients with germline gain-of-function (GOF) STAT3 mutations and Down Syndrome have an estimated 40-
fold and 5-fold higher risk of CeD, respectively, than the general population, along with a predisposition for
other autoimmune diseases, including thyroiditis and Type I Diabetes. Patients with Down Syndrome have
three copies of the gene for interferon (IFN) receptors on chromosome 21 and thus constitutive JAK-STAT
activation. The central hypothesis is that interferon and cytokines mediated JAK-STAT overactivation may
cause loss of T cell tolerance to gluten and an increased risk for CeD. The overall goal of this research is to
investigate the mechanism of JAK-STAT activation in the pathogenesis of CeD. To accomplish this, first, we
will conduct genetic investigation in 100 index cases with familial CeD and search for genetic variants in the
JAK-STAT pathway. We will also expand our cohort of CeD patients with known genetic diseases affecting
JAK-STAT activation, include patients with GOF-STAT3 and DS. Second, we will assess the key molecules in
the JAK-STAT pathway, including agonists, receptors, STAT and their phosphorylated forms, ISGs in
monocyte and CD4+ T cells to identify a molecular signature of active CeD. Third, we will investigate the
mechanisms of JAK-STAT overactivation on gluten-specific CD4+ T cells through both single cell RNA-Seq and
amplified T cell libraries, followed by testing the functional impact of JAK inhibitors on gluten-specific T cells.
The results of this study will delineate JAK-STAT activation and its potential as a therapeutic target for Celiac
Disease. Furthermore, through the proposed complementary career development plan, I will gain additional
training in clinical investigation on the genetics and immunology of CeD; advanced bioinformatic analysis with
RNA-seq; and laboratory-based training in gluten specific CD4+ T cells biology. Throughout this research and
career development activities, I will be mentored by a team lead by Dr. Timothy Wang, an internationally
recognized physician-scientist and an expert in inflammatory cytokines and their role in human gastrointestinal
diseases. I am committed to a career as an independent investigator in patient-oriented translational research;
and have designed my training plan to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to make a meaningful and
substantial contribution to the field by using a functional genetics approach to discover the therapeutic targets
in gastrointestinal diseases."

An adult makes 2.4 million red cells per second and production can increase 5-10-fold in response to anemia.
Over 95% of red cell protein content is hemoglobin; each cell contains 270 million hemoglobin molecules;
each with 4 heme moieties; yet free-heme is toxic and must be tightly regulated. As expected from these rapid
kinetics, CFU-E/proerythroblasts are especially vulnerable to heme toxicity since this is when heme synthesis
intensifies but globin expression is low. FLVCR is critical and functions as a safety valve, exporting excess
heme. In prior studies, we demonstrated that mice lacking FLVCR develop profound macrocytic anemia.
Similarities between the clinical phenotype of Flvcr1-deleted mice and patients with Diamond Blackfan anemia
(DBA) prompted investigation of this disorder during our last grant cycle. DBA results from the
haploinsufficiency of any one of 19 different ribosomal proteins, poor ribosomal assembly and slowed or
aberrant translation. We hypothesized that although heme synthesis initiates normally, globin translation is
slowed. Heme exceeds the capacity of FLVCR and induces excess ROS and cell death. Sufficient synthesis
of globin, a protein, requires robust translation. However, the synthesis of heme, a chemical, proceeds
via an enzymatic process. It requires only small quantities of protein (enzymes) and thus minimal
translation. When translation is impaired, heme production surpasses globin production. Should the
quantity of intracellular heme overwhelm the export capacity of FLVCR, toxicity occurs.
We first derived data supporting this hypothesis that heme toxicity underlies DBA anemia by studying the
in vitro erythroid differentiation of marrow cells from DBA patients. We also fully characterized two
informative murine models - Flvcr1-deleted and Rpl11-haploinsufficient mice, models of heme excess
and DBA, respectively. More recently, we developed single cell methods to query individual cell
decision-making. By linking each cell’s surface protein expression to its unique transcriptome, then
analyzing pseudotime trajectories, we confirmed the primacy of heme excess in causing ineffective
erythropoiesis in DBA, and also unexpectedly showed that heme modulates the effectiveness of normal
erythropoiesis, suggesting that it functions as a physiological rheostat. The goals of this competitive
renewal application are to more completely define the molecular mechanisms which regulate red cell
differentiation and how excess heme leads to cell death. We will also use our cellular and murine models to
identify and test new therapies for DBA, recognizing that these may be applicable to other settings with
ineffective erythropoiesis, such as thalassemia and MDS. Since heme is synthesized from succinyl CoA (a
TCA cycle intermediate) and glycine (an amino acid) and functions as a sensor of energy and protein
availability, these studies may also provide insight into other metabolically-sensitive on-off processes
regulated by heme, such as circadian rhythm and N-end rule pathway protein ubiquitination."
10834065,"Development of simulation bioengineering techniques in medical neuroscience has been limited due to 
computational neuroscience's focus on the higher capacities of humans, such as the ability to play 
chess or go. That has led to the notion that the brain can best be understood by recourse to the 
concepts of computer science: artificial neural networks, information theory, Bayesian inference, 
pattern recognition, etc. Whether or not these tools are sufficient for understanding human 
neocortical function, they are clearly not sufficient for understanding the nervous system 
dysfunction seen in neurological and psychiatric pathology. Brain disease, like diseases of other 
organ systems, is disease of biological tissue, and must eventually consider energetics and 
oxygenation, blood and brain pressures, as well as chemical reactions and diffusion of toxins and 
pharmaceuticals. Such full-organ simulation will require linkages to other simulators. Through such 
linkages, as well as through internal extensions, we have been extending the widely-used NEURON 
simulator to handle reaction-diffusion in neural tissue in order to better understand brain 
signaling, neurodegenerative toxic cascades, and drug effects. For the current funding period we 
will further augment NEURON's NRxD module through 4 Aims: 1. Improve synaptic modeling techniques 
by considering presynaptic volume, cleft and postsynaptic volume together to handle ionotropic 
synapses, metabotropic synapses, gap junctions and complex combination synapses; along with 
reuptake, diffusion, electrodiffusion, neurotransmitters, second messengers and retrograde 
neurotransmitters in a coordinated way. 2. Allow more rapid and more extensive exploration of 
parameter space by improving simulation speed and by allowing full state variable saving for 
improved simulation initialization and recovery from high-performance computing failures. 3. 
Develop both Python-based and socket-based application programming interfaces (APIs) for easier 
linkage with other simulators, including for electrodiffusion and for various types of stochastic 
simulation. 4. Continue package dissemination and education in order to get more computational and 
experimental NRxD users. We will continue to offer twice-yearly tutorials, and to sponsor 
additional workshops at Computational Neuroscience  and at other meetings. We will integrate online 
tutorials with the documentation to provide both Programmer's Reference and Biological Reference 
online manuals. We will develop a set of video tutorials associated with these that will eventually 
be linked together to make an online course. Overall, we expect that our novel simulation 
neurotechnology will be of increasing use and utilization both for research use, and for future 
clinical adoption in personalized medicine."
10903716,"Project summary: This project expands on decades of success elucidating the genetic and molecular
underpinnings of intercellular communication and cytoskeletal remodeling in gamete development in females
and males. We propose research in two interesting areas: 1) the inhibition of cellular abscission during
cytokinesis of dividing germline cells, and 2) the molecular regulation and functional significance of highly
efficient tissue-specific stop codon readthrough during protein translation. Proliferating germline cells in animal
ovaries and testes characteristically fail to complete abscission, leading to cell clusters that remain connected
by intercellular bridges, called ring canals. Incomplete cytokinesis also occurs in several lymphoproliferative
disorders, highlighting the importance of understanding how this noncanonical endpoint to mitosis is controlled.
Using live imaging of germline mitosis in the Drosophila testis, we discovered a previously unknown
intermediate step in ring canal formation involving a midbody-like structure that remodels into a channel
between daughter cells. To learn how this maturation step occurs and how the molecular machinery that drives
abscission is inhibited from localizing to midbodies, we will use localized biotinylation to identify midbody
components and probe the genetic requirement for proteins known to function during cytokinesis. We will also
use localized biotinlylation to identify ring canal proteins at the plasma membrane-cytoskeleton interface. Our
interest in stop codon readthrough stems from our extensive analysis of the kelch gene and its function during
oogenesis. The kelch mRNA encodes a large open reading frame (ORF) punctuated by a single stop codon. In
ovaries, translation terminates at the stop to produce a ring canal protein and there is no apparent function for
the second ORF. In contrast, we have observed remarkably high efficiency stop codon readthrough in nerves
of the central nervous system (CNS) of larvae and adults, producing abundant ORF1+ORF2 protein.
Furthermore, kelch and several other genes in Drosophila display efficient stop codon readthrough specifically
in the CNS, suggesting the presence of many proteins with carboxy-terminal extensions of unknown function.
We will systematically analyze the scope and scale of stop codon readthrough using ribosome profiling of
neuronal tissue and mass spectrometry of total protein lysates to identify readthrough peptides. To define the
mechanism of readthrough, we will use genetic screens to investigate both stimulatory cis-acting sequences
flanking stop codons in readthrough genes and trans-acting factors. Finally, to understand the function of
neuronal stop codon readthrough, we will use gene editing to ablate ORF2 from kelch and several other genes
and carefully analyze phenotypes using cell biological and behavioral assays. This research program will lead
to discoveries concerning the fundamental cell biological and genetic mechanisms that regulate important
noncanonical biological phenomena – an alternate ending to cytokinesis that produces syncytia of animal
germline cells and ribosomal readthrough of stop codons that expands the neuronal proteome."
10857280,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Metastasis is the main cause of deaths related to malignant melanoma. Studies over the last decade have
revealed that the metastatic process is not primarily driven by genetic changes. Instead, deregulation of gene
expression through epigenetic, transcriptional, or posttranscriptional mechanisms as well as copy number
alterations may promote melanoma metastasis. Our previous work described how messenger RNAs engage in
protein coding-independent posttranscriptional regulation by sequestering microRNAs (miRNAs) from other
transcripts, and we termed such natural miRNA sponges competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs).
Deregulated ceRNA expression has been causally linked to cancer development, and thus genomic copy
number gains of ceRNA genes may be an important driver of malignant progression of melanoma. We have
identified a cluster of melanoma ceRNA genes localized on chromosome 1q, which undergoes copy number
gains (1qGAIN) in 25-50% of melanoma. 1qGAIN is more frequent in metastases, suggesting that 1qGAIN ceRNAs
may contribute to melanoma progression. Our predictions identified CEP170 as a potent 1qGAIN ceRNA, and
preliminary experiments revealed its oncogenic role in vitro and in vivo. Two additional 1qGAIN ceRNAs,
NUCKS1 and ZC3H11A, exhibited oncogenic potential and enhanced the CEP170-mediated effects. Thus,
gains of 1q may lead to overexpression of multiple ceRNAs that promote melanoma metastasis by
sequestering tumor suppressive miRNAs. We have identified five metastasis-associated miRNAs that are
sequestered by CEP170 and that promote melanoma cell migration and invasion. In this proposal, we will
systematically examine the oncogenic role of 1qGAIN ceRNAs in melanoma metastasis. Specifically, in Aim 1
we will examine if the 3'UTR of CEP170 promotes melanoma dissemination in a miRNA binding site-specific
manner using metastasis and autochthonous models. In Aim 2 we will assess if the release of miRNAs from
the endogenous CEP170 transcript opposes metastasis, and if these miRNAs have tumor suppressive activity
in melanoma cells. Moreover, we will identify and characterize downstream effectors that mediate the CEP170-
provoked phenotype. Finally, in Aim 3 we will examine if NUCKS1 and ZC3H11A boost the effect of CEP170
by augmenting miRNA sequestration. We will also test if any of the remaining 1qGAIN ceRNAs, ten in total,
possess oncogenic activity and cooperate with CEP170. We expect that our study will reveal the biological
relevance of 1qGAIN ceRNAs to melanoma metastasis and further elucidate the mechanisms underlying ceRNA-
mediated melanoma progression and metastasis."
10837775,"Pharmacology is at a crossroads. Although technological advances in chemistry and biology have transformed
drug discovery, our ability to develop new therapeutics has lagged behind our clinical needs. This gap reflects a
disconnect between basic science discovery and translational research, and addressing this challenge will require
scientists who can bridge these two areas. Toward this goal, the Stanford Molecular Pharmacology Training Program
(MPTP) aims to empower predoctoral students across the biosciences with specialized training in drug discovery and
development.
 The MPTP is founded on the rich history of pharmacology research and education at Stanford, and it now
transcends conventional academic boundaries. Our training program draws upon an outstanding group of 26 highly
collaborative Stanford faculty from multiple departments, and it builds upon the strength of SPARK, a translational
research initiative that was created at Stanford in 2006. In addition to their independent research with MPTP faculty,
our trainees receive formal course work in drug discovery, and they attend weekly presentations by SPARK-affiliated
experts in pharma/biotech, patent law, venture capital, clinical medicine, and other areas related to therapeutic
development. MPTP students also participate in summer biotech internships and clinical shadowing opportunities,
supplementing their academic training with industrial and clinical experiences.
 These training activities are integrated with courses on the responsible conduct of research, rigor, and
reproducibility, weekly student/faculty research forums, annual retreats, grant writing and science communication
workshops, and outreach opportunities. Our predoctoral students are also encouraged to propose translational
projects, which are reviewed and funded by SPARK on a competitive basis. These team-based projects provide hands-
on, real-world experience in therapeutic development and direct interactions with industry veterans and experts. Our
program carefully tracks student research progress, faculty mentorship, and program effectiveness to enable the
MPTP to continually evolve to meet its educational mission. To train scientific leaders and innovators who will impact
communities throughout the United States, we have also established recruitment and retention strategies to foster
student diversity, leveraging Stanford resources and mobilizing the MPTP community.
 Through its innovative curriculum and partnerships with SPARK and industry, the MPTP will impart its students
with rigorous training in basic science and an understanding of drug discovery and development. Graduates of our
training program will be uniquely able to translate fundamental discoveries into clinical advances, and they will be well-
positioned to become scientific leaders in academia, industry, government, and other sectors."
10833493,"The formation of mutations in cellular DNA lies at the heart of cancer and its treatment. Patients diagnosed
with the deadliest solid tumors undergo treatment based on the alterations of DNA sequence in their cancer,
and further mutations that occur during treatment cause all-too-common adverse outcomes, including the
emergence of drug resistance and metastasis. Of course, these DNA alterations are responsible for the
genesis of malignancies in the first place, as accumulated mutations in driver genes lead to uncontrolled
growth. Strategies for suppressing mutagenesis can be important for preventing cancer in at-risk populations,
and for limiting the emergence of drug resistance and metastasis in existing cancer patients.
 Here we propose to test a new, molecularly targeted approach to agents that suppress this adverse
mutagenesis. Our strategy is based on the most common molecular origins of these cancers: namely, point
mutations that arise from specific forms of DNA damage. Our specific aims for the four-year term of the project
are to develop new probes to quantify DNA damage in cells and tissues; to identify and develop new small-
molecule activators of the repair enzymes that repair the most common sources of mutations; to test whether
upregulating DNA repair can suppress the emergence of cancer drug resistance; and to test whether we can
lower the incidence of cancer in tumor-prone mice.
 In progress leading up to this proposal, we have devised several novel and sensitive chemical probes as
first-in-class reporters that can measure the cellular activities of multiple DNA repair enzymes. We have
employed these probes in clinically relevant studies of cell and tumor specimens, and in investigating
connections between inflammation and DNA repair in animal models of disease. In addition, we have used
these probes to develop new small-molecule modulators of these pathways, including, excitingly, the only
known activators of some of these enzymes. Putting our experience together, we have developed new
hypotheses regarding how upregulating the activities of these pathways via small molecules can provide
biologically important, and potentially clinically useful, outcomes in cancer.
 This research is important because it addresses the possibility of preventing common and deadly cancers
that remain difficult to treat. In addition, our team will develop molecular tools, including probes, assays, and
cell lines, that are likely to be useful to the cancer research community as a whole. Our research plan is
innovative in several ways: it will develop and apply new molecular tools for assessing damage and repair
pathways; it will lead to the development of the first small-molecule activators of multiple repair enzymes; and
it tests new hypotheses regarding how modulating repair activities will be helpful in treatment - and even
prevention - of these serious malignancies."

10808086,"In the US, 15 million people have alcohol use disorders (AUD) and 95,000 people die per year of alcohol
attributable causes, making alcohol misuse the third-leading preventable cause of death in the United States.
Despite the overwhelming need for better prevention and treatment of the health consequence for AUD, the
biomedical science workforce devoted to this problem is inadequate.
The University of Nebraska Medical Center has a history of performing quality alcohol-related research since
the 1960s. This history, existing infrastructure, and organization of multiple enthusiastic, federally funded
alcohol researchers makes us well positioned to continue to provide superior training and inspire the next
generation of alcohol researchers. Our program’s goal is to provide a diverse group of undergraduate students
with early, immersive exposures to alcohol research with the hope of launching some of these students on their
way to careers in biomedical and alcohol-focused research.
We have a strong track record of supporting the development of young scientists with our Summer
Undergraduate Alcohol Research Program (SUARP). The SUARP was initiated in 2012 with funding through
the NIAAA and has trained 77 undergraduate students. We have been successful in recruiting a diverse
student population with 30% of our students identifying as underrepresented minorities in science. Our
program is already making progress in achieving its major long-term objective of adding to the biomedical
research workforce. Of the 77 students participating in the 10-week program since 2012, we have follow-up
data on 71 (92%). Of those, 72% reported participating in a research project after completing our program, 7%
are in graduate school in a science field, and 58% are in health professions school or are practicing clinicians.
The SUARP program will provide a 10-week, hands-on, mentored, research experience for undergraduate
students to stimulate their interest in careers in biomedical research. As a part of the program, we will teach
SUARP students the pathophysiological consequences of alcohol misuse on human health. We will also
introduce students to the scientific skills needed to build a successful scientific career.
This is a comprehensive, intense program of scientific training dedicated to developing the next generation of
scientists engaged in examining the challenging issue of alcohol intake and its impact on health. We have built
a strong program and remain enthusiastic to continue to serve students and contribute to the improvement of
the diversity of the alcohol research community."
10810865,"ABSTRACT
Circadian (24-hour) rhythms are an essential part of human biology and physiology. A growing number of
studies have shown that disruption of our biological clock is detrimental to health, with night and rotating shift
workers at substantially increased risk of developing numerous disease pathologies, including cancer,
diabetes, obesity, and chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, an understanding of the mechanisms by
which circadian disruption are linked to disease development would be of great benefit to a growing
percentage of the population subjected to circadian disruption of various forms.
Impaired circadian rhythms and gastrointestinal inflammation are directly associated with several leading
digestive tract disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While not well studied in a circadian
context, complement activation and the complement anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, have been implicated in
immune dysfunction are tightly linked to the development of numerous diseases, including asthma, cancer,
diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. Our preliminary data indicate that the complement anaphylatoxins,
which are phlogistic peptides with critical roles in host defense and the immune response, may provide the link
between circadian disruption and vulnerability to diseases, including gastrointestinal disease. These data
indicate that the complement anaphylatoxins (at the level of the peptides themselves as well as their specific
receptors) are under direct circadian control in vivo and provide circadian modulation of intestinal lymph
exchange in vivo. The overall hypothesis of this application is that the regulation of inflammation and
immunity by the complement system (largely via the complement activation anaphylatoxin peptides) is
greatly affected by disruption of the 24-hour circadian clock leading to dysregulation of the immune
response and normal lymphatic function. Th circadian dependent complement mediated dysfunction
of inflammation and immunity in turn leads to increased disease pathologies, including but not limited
to the development of digestive disorders such as IBD. In support of this hypothesis, novel preliminary
data are presented showing that C5a modulates the cellular content and T-cell polarization in gut lymphoid
tissue in a circadian dependent manner. In addition, the expression of the complement anaphylatoxin
receptors, C3aR and C5aR1, is deficient in Peyer’s patches in a model of circadian-dependent peripheral
arrhythmicity. These data strongly suggest that the C3a/C3aR and C5a/C5aR1 axis is a novel and important
mechanism by which circadian gating of the host lymphatic immune response occurs, and that it is a previously
unknown yet important link between circadian disruption and disease pathologies, including the development
of inflammatory bowel disease. Using circadian mutant models, genetic and environmental manipulation of the
complement system, state of the art imaging, and molecular/bio-analytical tools we will delineate the
mechanisms by which the complement anaphylatoxins modulate intestinal lymphatics in a circadian manner."

 From Taxol® to artesunate to retapamulin, complex terpenes have had a profound impact on both the
treatment and understanding of human disease. Despite their enormous medicinal relevance, however, most
complex terpene architectures are not optimal starting points for exhaustive medicinal and chemical biological
studies, and unlike many small molecule drug discovery programs, it is difficult to easily mix- and-match structural
fragments. The proposed research program seeks to discover and develop simple, modular synthetic pathways
to access complex, medicinally relevant terpenoid natural products and determine their protein targets. At the
core of this proposal is the desire to greatly simplify terpene synthesis by using simple isoprene-derived units
and chiral pool materials in concert with novel methodologies and synthetic strategies. The targets chosen for
this program represent both state-of-the-art challenges for complex molecule synthesis as well as potential next-
generation therapeutics ideal for in-depth chemical biological studies. Owing to their potent cytotoxic properties,
complex quassinoid triterpenes have remained attractive targets for decades, yet synthetic routes to these
molecules are lengthy and many members have yet to succumb to syntheses at all. Using novel cross-coupling
methodology we have developed a blueprint for facile access to this family. Cyclized, marine cembranoids
represent a structurally fascinating class of terpene targets with intriguing, yet poorly understood, cytotoxic
activities. Despite much work from numerous laboratories, many flagship members have eluded practitioners of
chemical synthesis for decades. Using a chiral pool building block-based approach and various radical
cyclization strategies, we believe many such targets can be accesses efficiently allowing for their protein targets
to be interrogated using cutting-edge proteomics techniques. Overall this program seeks to use advances in
synthetic chemistry to construct rare, biologically active terpenes with high efficiency allowing interrogation of
their anti-cancer properties and protein targets. In the process of this work, students will be provided with rigorous
and intellectually stimulating training in synthetic chemistry."
10807043,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 I propose to develop and test a machine learning (ML) algorithm that uses dynamic data from pulse
oximetry for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening. Oxygen saturation (SpO2)-based screening is
the current standard for CCHD screening; however, it fails to detect 50% of asymptomatic newborns with
CCHD or nearly 900 newborns in the United States annually. Most newborns missed by SpO2 screening have
defects with systemic obstruction, such as coarctation of the aorta (CoA), that do not cause hypoxemia. Pulse
oximetry can also measure non-invasive measurements such as perfusion such as perfusion index (PIx),
radiofemoral delay, heart rate, and other waveform characteristics. Introduction of other pulse oximetry
features is expected to improve CCHD and CoA detection. My recent work revealed improved CCHD detection
using ML algorithms that combined pulse oximetry features. The algorithms improved CCHD detection to at
least 93%, including improved detection of CoA, while maintaining high specificity. However, the model
depended on two separate measurements including simultaneously artifact free waveforms in both the right
hand and a foot. Having a model with dynamic prognostication that allows for an infant’s predicted outcome to
change as new data is incorporated could be better. Additionally, the amount of time to obtain two waveforms
that are artifact free in a possibly moving baby needs to be understood for implementation.
 Therefore, I will develop and test a ML algorithm that combines pulse oximetry features and
incorporates dynamic data from repeated measurements allowing a newborn’s predicted classification (CCHD
vs no-CCHD) to change as new data is incorporated. I will do this in two ways. The first will utilize only
inpatient measurements and will externally validate our recently developed ML algorithm. This first approach
will also test a “repeat” screen for any initial “fails,” an approach that mimics the current SpO2 standard screen
and is expected to keep the false positive rate below 1%. The second approach will incorporate measurements
after 48 hours of age (including from the outpatient setting). Outpatient CCHD screening has not been studied.
Most newborns are seen for routine follow up outpatient around the age at which CoA becomes more
clinically apparent, and thus, more likely to be detected by non-invasive perfusion assessments.
 This study is significant because a dynamic screening model that includes perfusion data could save the
lives of hundreds of newborns with CCHD that are not diagnosed by SpO2 screening annually. Additionally, it
is innovative because it makes use of readily available non-invasive pulse oximetry data and will use dynamic
data (inpatient and outpatient) that allows for a newborn’s prognostication to change as new data is
incorporated. From this study and career plan, I will gain skills in machine learning with emphasis in dynamic
approaches, and implementation science. I will use the results and skills from this proposal to then study a
cluster randomized trial of our algorithm and assess implementation processes."
10828301,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects 20% of veterans and costs the VA almost $1.5 billion annually. In addition to
insulin resistance, the hyperglycemia that defines T2D is caused by insufficient insulin secretion and
dysregulated glucagon secretion from the β and α cells of pancreatic islets. T2D islets are also characterized
by changes in vasculature, increased inflammation, and deposition of insoluble amyloid, composed primarily of
islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). Soluble IAPP oligomers, rather than the amyloid itself, are toxic to β cells,
through various postulated mechanisms including ER stress, oxidative stress, membrane permeabilization, and
receptor-mediated signaling. The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), which binds several
extracellular ligands and activates intracellular inflammatory signaling pathways, was recently shown to bind
IAPP oligomers and mediate IAPP oligomer-induced toxicity in β cells using cell and islet culture models and
transgenic mouse models. However, it is unknown if IAPP-RAGE signaling occurs in human islets, if such
signaling occurs in non-β islet cells including α cells, what effect IAPP-RAGE signaling in specific cell types
has on human islet function, and what specific RAGE signaling pathways are activated in human islet cells. I
hypothesize that IAPP oligomer-induced activation of RAGE receptors on β and ⍺ cells modulates
human islet function and health in vitro and in vivo. To test my hypothesis and fill these knowledge gaps, I
will leverage four new experimental techniques to study primary human islet cells: 1) recently developed
pseudoislet methodology that allows efficient cell-specific genetic manipulation of human islets; 2)
transplantation of human pseudoislets into mice to enable longitudinal analysis of structure and function in
vivo; 3) modified intravital imaging techniques to visualize amyloid formation and cell death longitudinally; 4)
single nuclear isolation and sequencing technologies to detect changes in gene expression in transduced
pseudoislets. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that RAGE mediates IAPP oligomer-induced β cell
dysfunction in human islets in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that IAPP-RAGE signaling in
⍺ cells causes dysregulated glucagon secretion in human islets in vitro and in vivo. These experiments will
clarify fundamental processes in T2D pathogenesis and help identify novel targets to treat and prevent T2D. I
will complete these aims as part of an intensive supervised career development plan with oversight and
guidance from an expert multi-disciplinary mentoring committee. I will receive formal and informal training in
five fundamental areas: 1) new and emerging experimental techniques; 2) scientific education; 3) presentation
and communication skills; 4) professional development; and 5) laboratory management. These skills and the
results of my proposed experiments will form a strong foundation for my independent research program as I
work to improve the understanding and treatment of diabetes mellitus.

10588686,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the general population and develops at a 60%
higher rate in the Veteran Population. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
are associated with the development of amyloid and tau pathology and increase the rate of cognitive decline,
ultimately resulting in significant morbidity to veterans and their families. Altered plasticity and neurotransmitter
pathways are strongly implicated in cognitive dysfunction associated with Alzheimer’s disease since they
compromise the integrity of neuronal circuits. Understanding the mechanisms of plasticity dysfunction will allow
us to identify specific checkpoints that can be targeted in the future to restore function, potentially ameliorating
Alzheimer’s cognitive sequelae.
Outstanding questions include: 1) what cell-specific transcriptomic abnormalities reflect plasticity pathway
pathophysiology in Alzheimer’s disease, 2) what is the topographic relation between the location of b-amyloid
deposits and the manifestation of transcriptomic and functional (neuronal response properties) abnormalities in
different cell types, 3) how does the transcriptomic and functional profile of circuit dysfunction deteriorates during
disease progression? To probe the capacity of cortical circuits for plasticity we use a well-validated implicit visual
learning paradigm (stimulus-selective response potentiation or SRP) introduced by M Bear. Implicit learning
developed phylogenetically earlier than conscious learning, is ubiquitous in the neocortex and plays a
fundamental role in re-shaping cortical circuits to meet changing environmental demands. It is a true memory
phenomenon that shares core molecular features with LTP, requires sleep for consolidation and has a behavioral
correlate. Working in the visual cortex confers a strong advantage for dissecting circuit mechanisms of plasticity
dysfunction in AD, since excellent control of the input allows a precise quantification of how neuronal properties
change with learning in a particularly well-studied neocortical circuit.
We will use chronic in vivo 2-photon imaging to measure neuronal responses before and after SRP as a function of
distance from b-amyloid deposits at different stages of disease progression, in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD.
Two-photon measurements will be complemented with the recently developed high-throughput multiplexed error-
robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) imaging, to dissect how mRNA expression profiles change in
different types of neurons and glia as a function of distance from b-amyloid foci. Aligning in vivo imaging with cell-
specific MERFISH images obtained in vitro from the same tissue, will link abnormal neuronal responses and
plasticity profiles to transcriptomic signatures obtained from the same neurons. An added benefit of this is that it
can potentially extend our observations to the earliest period of malfunction, preceding amyloid plaque formation.
Aim 1. Use chronic in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging to study how pyramidal neuron responses change with
SRP-training as a function of distance from b-amyloid plaques in the 5xFAD mouse model of amyloid deposition,
at different time points in AD progression. Goal 1: Identify neuronal response biomarkers of abnormal plasticity
as a function of distance from b-amyloid plaques, including early in the disease progression potentially preceding
b-amyloid deposition. Aim 2. Use MERFISH to map single-cell-specific transcriptomic profiles of plasticity and
neurotransmitter-receptor pathways before and after SRP training, in the 5xFAD mouse model. Goal 2: Define
how cell-specific transcriptomic dysregulation of plasticity and neurotransmitter-receptor pathways manifests with
proximity to b-amyloid deposits as well as in relation to abnormal neuronal responses and plasticity profiles.
In summary, the pipeline developed will characterize AD associated plasticity-pathway transcriptomic dysfunction
in a topographically resolved cell-specific way, linking it to in vivo profiling of neuronal function. In time, we expect
this approach to prove valuable for answering a broad range of pathophysiological questions about additional

treatment for such individuals. Finding a better remedy for them is an important niche and immediate unmet
need. The aim of this pre-clinical project is to substantiate the therapeutic effect of combined alpha-1-
antitrypsin (AAT) + enoxaparin (a low molecular weight heparin) against SARS-CoV-2 infection and its
consequences. Establishing the efficacy of AAT + enoxaparin combination will provide a necessary foundation
for future clinical trials with the goal of employing effective therapy for those with severe COVID-19.
 We have novel biological evidence supported by Artificial Intelligence-based molecular modeling
that enoxaparin synergizes with AAT to inhibit TMPRSS2 (a cell surface protease that activates the spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2) and to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in primary human airway epithelial cells (hAEc)
and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Because both AAT and enoxaparin embrace a panoply of
activities that antagonize other pathogenic mechanisms of severe COVID-19 – including anti-inflammatory,
anti-thrombotic, pro-autophagy (known to kill MERS-CoV), and endothelial cell protection – we hypothesize
that the AAT + enoxaparin combination will be most effective (compared to each alone) in mitigating SARS-
CoV-2 infection and its consequences.
 We will use three complementary models to elucidate the efficacy of AAT, enoxaparin, and combination of
both against SARS-CoV-2 infection: (i) primary hAEc since they express high ACE2 levels, fulminant airway
disease occurs, and infection of ciliated hAEc and breach of their defense initiates a portal of entry into the
lower airways / alveoli to cause COVID-19 pneumonia; (ii) MDM + plasma derived from AAT-deficient
individuals immediately before and immediately after receiving routine intravenous AAT since macrophages
are key orchestrators of the hyper-inflammatory response seen with COVID-19; and (iii) two murine models,
one with wildtype AAT and another with AAT knocked out.
Aim 1: Determine in primary hAEc the mechanisms by which AAT, enoxaparin, and both reduce SARS-
CoV-2 infection and its consequences. Approach: hAEc will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 followed by no
treatment or treatment with AAT, enoxaparin, or combination of both and assayed for viral load, autophagic
flux, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and hAEc viability and barrier integrity.
Aim 2: Determine in macrophages the mechanisms by which AAT (given in vivo) ± enoxaparin mitigate
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Approach: infect human MDM cultured in autologous plasma – prepared from AAT-
deficient individuals before and after AAT infusions ± ex vivo enoxaparin – with SARS-CoV-2 and determine
viral load, autophagic flux, and pro-inflammatory cytokine / macrophage extracellular trap (METs) production.
Aim 3: Determine if SARS-CoV-2 infection of mice is mitigated by AAT, enoxaparin, and combination of
both. Approach: transgenic (Tg) mice bred to express human ACE2 with or without deletion of AAT (to
represent humans who are AAT-replete and AAT-deficient, respectively) will either be left untreated or treated
with AAT, enoxaparin, or the combination along with SARS-CoV-2 infection. From the lungs and spleens, we
will quantify viral load and the phenotypes of macrophages, dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in
both organs, as well as analyze the lungs for epithelial and endothelial injury, co-localization of SARS-CoV-2
with airway and alveolar epithelial cells, and neutrophil extracelluar trap (NETs) formation (both METs and
NETs implicated in immunothrombosis of severe COVID-19).
 Establishing the efficacy of AAT + enoxaparin combination will provide a foundation for future clinical trials
with the goal of employing more effective therapy for veterans and non-veterans with severe COVID-19."
10747415,"Diabetes is a significant public health problem that affects 34 million individuals in the United States with
substantial disparities in prevalence and outcomes by race and sex. A growing body of evidence highlights
structural racism and increased social risk as factors which account for racial disparities in diabetes outcomes.
Incarceration is a major social risk factor with significant overlap with populations most likely to experience
poor diabetes outcomes. Black men are disproportionately incarcerated relative to their White counterparts.
With longer sentences and aging of the prison population, more Black men with pre-existing diabetes are
returning to their communities. However, to date, limited research exists on interventions which mitigate the
negative impact of incarceration on diabetes care and outcomes. There is considerable evidence nurse case
management (NCM) interventions improve diabetes outcomes; however, standard models do not account for
the unique needs of formerly incarcerated Black men. Flexible models outside the traditional healthcare clinic
setting have been successful in Black men with other chronic disease, such as hypertension. While there is a
paucity of interventional research examining chronic disease outcomes for patients with recent release from
incarceration, studies have underscored the need for basic needs navigation and healthcare system navigation
during reentry. Thus, the focus of this career development grant will be to test the preliminary efficacy of a
novel nurse case manager intervention, MANAGe-DM, comprised of three components: diabetes
education/skills training, basic needs navigation, and health system navigation in improving glycemic control,
blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, self-care behaviors, and quality of life in Black men with poorly controlled type
2 diabetes released from prison in the prior year. During the completion of this grant, the applicant will
complete training and gain expertise in the 1) implementation and oversite of randomized control trials and
diabetes interventions, 2) understanding the influence of structural racism on health outcomes, 3) use of
advanced statistical skills for interventional research, and 4) study of community-engaged research."
10782489,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The CDC estimates that at least 200,000 older Americans (> 65 years) will have a traumatic brain injury (TBI)
each year, primarily caused by a closed head injury (CHI) from a fall. The aged brain, with Alzheimer’s disease
neuropathological changes, has significant reactive microglia and astrocytes and other markers of
neuroinflammation. An acquired brain injury can further exacerbate this state of reactive gliosis and
neuroinflammation. Alzheimer’s disease poses a significant therapeutic challenge, given that pathology can
develop over decades. However, we believe that it is an obtainable therapeutic goal to prevent the worsening
of neuroinflammation caused by an acquired brain injury in those at risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease .
Control of neuroinflammation following the TBI in older adults is a promising avenue for improving patient
outcomes. However, no drug has earned FDA approval for specific use in mild TBI. There is also limited
evidence to guide the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs that target neuroinflammation for this unique
population. Broad-spectrum immunosuppressants are not advisable and, while selective biologics (such as
anti-TNF) are promising, they also come with the risk of increasing infection, which is problematic in an older
adult population at risk for infections. Our goal is to identify targeted immunomodulatory (not,
immunosuppressants) with a high benefit-to-risk ratio. We recently identified the commonly prescribed
antibiotic, Azithromycin (AZM), as an immunomodulatory agent with neuroprotective effects in spinal cord
injury. Because of its safety profile, AZM is frequently prescribed as a prophylactic treatment in several
conditions and broadly administered in at-risk disease populations. This proposal aims to provide proof-of-
principal data for AZM as a safe and effective neuroinflammatory modulatory drug. We will test the central
hypothesis that AZM can alter neuroinflammation and improve cognitive outcomes following a CHI in an
APP/PS1 KI mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease-related pathology in the following two specific aims (SA).
 SA1: Define the immunomodulatory dose-dependent effect of AZM in 8-month-old APP/PS1 KI mouse
 model following a CHI.
 SA2: Evaluate the effects of AZM on CHI-induced behavioral and Alzheimer’s disease-related
 neuropathology in 8-month-old APP/PS1 KI mice.
This proof-of-concept study could establish AZM as a safe and well-tolerated FDA-approved drug to reduce
damage and speed recovery in the fragile older brain following a CHI. Once the feasibility of AZM treatment
has been established, new areas of drug development and clinical research with the potential to more quickly
develop a new drug to slow the devastating effects of Alzheimer’s disease can be created."
10898542,"Project Abstract
The proposed randomized control trial of a technology-enhanced coparenting and parenting intervention,
addresses three key weaknesses in existing parenting programs by 1) targeting mothers and fathers, rather
than mothers alone; 2) focusing on both the coparenting and parent-infant relationship, not just parent-infant
interactions; and 3) using technology to enhance program retention and engagement. Our team leveraged
content from two evidence-based interventions in combination with unique technological features to create a
novel intervention: Connect to Baby (CTB), a 6-session manualized intervention. Parenting and coparenting
quality are selected as targets for their strategic influence on infant and child development: contingent,
responsive interactions between parents and infants are associated with better lifelong socioemotional and
cognitive outcomes. Similarly, supportive coparenting relationships and coordination are associated with
enhanced parent mental health, parenting quality, and children’s socioemotional and cognitive outcomes. A
key innovation of CTB lies in the introduction and rehearsal of four interaction skills –– Noticing, Following,
Talking, and Encouraging –– to foster serve and return interactions with infants as well as supportive,
cooperative coparenting interactions between mothers and fathers. To maximize program reach and
sustainability, CTB is designed to be delivered within Early Head Start (EHS), a family-serving agency parents
already use and trust. Finally, CTB uses a hybrid in-person and remote delivery modality using both video-
enabled tablets and a custom-built application to schedule sessions and share digital content to boost program
retention and engagement. Using a randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of CTB delivered as part of EHS
(EHS-CTB hybrid) will be compared to EHS with the digital content only (EHS-digital only); both groups will be
given access to the customized application and digital content that CTB offers, but only the EHS-CTB hybrid
group will receive program sessions with guided practice and feedback on NiFTE skill development. The study
will assess program impacts on coparenting communication quality and parenting quality at 3- and 6-months
post-random assignment to distinguish immediate from sustained effects of the program. Analyses will include
both intent-to-treat (ITT) and treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) analyses to determine the importance of program
dosage for program efficacy. CTB will also be assessed with regard to parent mental health (parenting stress
and depression) and child socioemotional and language outcomes. If demonstrated to be efficacious, CTB will
provide EHS, among the nation’s largest federally-funded early education programs, with a brief, cost-effective,
manualized preventive intervention that could be used in conjunction with EHS center and home-visiting
services to improve parenting quality and coparenting, engage fathers in programming and caregiving, and,
ultimately, enhance child development. This study will also offer some of the first evidence as to the feasibility
of retaining fathers in parenting programs at every stage of an intervention."

Leaderless mRNAs lack a 5’ UTR and SD sequence. Such mRNAs are common in Bacteria and Archaea, with
Mycobacteria being the most striking example, as about one-third of mycobacterial mRNAs are naturally
leaderless. Leaderless translation is part of a stress response and adaptation mechanism in bacteria. In
contrast to the well-understood Shine Dalgarno-containing mRNAs, very little is known about the initiation
mechanism of leaderless mRNAs. Biochemical, experimental, and systematic analysis of leaderless mRNA
expression suggested that leaderless mRNAs are translated and regulated via alternative mechanisms.
However, how this initiation is occurring and regulated remains unknown. Thus, to understand bacterial
physiology and antibiotic resistance, we need to reveal the molecular mechanism of leaderless translation.
This proposal aims to address this need. We will use single-molecule methods that are particularly well suited
for the dissection of dynamic processes, such as translation. We developed a single-molecule fluorescence
system that allows us to observe the entire initiation process. We can directly follow mRNA, ribosomal
subunits, and translation factors, thus defining how initiation is occurring and regulated. In aim 1, we will
determine how leaderless mRNAs are recruited to the ribosomes and how the start codon is recognized. We
will directly test for the existence of the proposed alternative initiation mechanisms. Namely, we will define if
mRNAs are directly recruited to the 70S ribosomes. We will then determine if start codon recognition is
concurrent with mRNA recruitment, as was previously proposed. We will also determine the role of initiation
factors in regulation of leaderless translation. In Aim 2, we will focus on the roles of mRNA sequence and
structure. Translation efficiency of leaderless mRNAs is regulated by the start codon sequence, presence of
nucleotides upstream of the start codon, and mRNA secondary structure. We will use our single-molecule
toolkit to determine how these elements regulate translation. In particular, we are interested in how they affect
alternative initiation pathways."
10896135,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Astroviruses have been recently recognized as an emerging cause of central nervous system infections
in humans, with astrovirus VA1 (VA1) as the most frequently identified astrovirus genotype. We previously
described the capacity of VA1 to infect primary human astrocytes and induce expression of inflammatory
cytokines like CXCL10, which can directly induce neuronal apoptosis. The histology from the VA1 cases of
encephalitis identified neuronal injury and apoptosis, but in cell culture, VA1 cannot replicate in primary human
neurons. These findings suggest that VA1 could cause neuronal apoptosis through an indirect mechanism,
including infection of astrocytes leading to CXCL10 expression and induction of apoptosis. It is also possible that
neuronal cell culture does not reflect necessary conditions for VA1 replication and a better model is needed.
 To further study the neuropathogenicity, we did not detect significant viral replication in brain tissue from
mice inoculated with VA1. In contrast, inoculation of human cerebral organoids (hCOs) with VA1 resulted in a
>500-fold increase in viral RNA 72 hours post-inoculation. These results demonstrate the capacity of hCOs to
support VA1 replication and now we can leverage this system to better understand cell-to-cell interactions that
are important during VA1 infection. hCOs consist of multiple cell types from the central nervous system, including
mature/immature neurons, astrocytes, and neural progenitor cells. Our protocol can generate hCOs with robust
populations of astrocytes and neurons, enabling cross-talk between cell types. In Aim 1, we will study the cellular
tropisms of VA1. We developed a novel fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemical (IHC)
assays to detect VA1 that can co-localize with host markers of different cellular lineages. Using FISH and IHC,
we will define the cell lineages that support infection by VA1. Based on our previous results, we hypothesize
astrocytes but not neurons support VA1 replication. Nonetheless, the hCOs will allow us to determine if other
cell types, including neurons, support VA1 infection. In Aim 2, we will determine the consequences of VA1
infection. Given that VA1 induces neuronal apoptosis in vivo, we hypothesize that VA1 will also induce apoptosis
of neurons in hCOs. We will identify cells that are undergoing apoptosis after infection by staining for activated
caspase-3 and by TUNEL. Cells positive for apoptosis will be co-stained with cell lineage markers to identify the
cell types that are undergoing apoptosis. We will also perform single-cell RNA-seq to further describe the cellular
response to infection. This analysis will determine if VA1 infection induces expression of inflammatory cytokines,
like CXCL10, in hCOs. In addition, RNA-seq will identify if other signaling pathways, including cell death
pathways, that are activated in VA1 infected and uninfected cells. By dissecting the tropisms and consequences
of VA1 infection in hCOs, this is a novel extension of a previously funded K08 award and will establish an
essential tool to understand astrovirus induced neuropathology. This application will also enable further research
independence of the primary investigator, achieving the goals set forth under PAR-20-291."

A recent multi-institutional study suggested that graduating general surgery trainees could not independently
perform common operations over 20% of the time. These findings raise serious concerns about the readiness
of early career surgeons to provide safe, high-quality surgical care. The degree to which these training
deficiencies compromise patient safety is unknown. A better understanding of the relationship between surgical
training, surgeon performance, and patient outcomes is needed to effectively tackle these issues. Ultimately,
we must update the standards that must be met by all surgical trainees prior to graduation. There are,
however, several knowledge gaps that must be addressed before the full potential of this approach can be
realized. The purpose of this proposal is to close those gaps and map a policy response moving forward. The
specific research aims of this proposal are to (i) determine the operative performance of early career surgeons
assessed using risk-adjusted outcomes in national Medicare claims data; (ii) determine if a surgeon’s trainee
performance ratings are valid predictors of their early career risk-adjusted patient outcomes; and (iii) determine
if initial certification of surgeons immediately after training reliably discriminate early career surgeon
performance. This study will, for the first time, determine the degree to which early career surgeon competence
impacts health care quality and whether existing measures of trainee competence are useful predictors of early
career performance. The results of this study can ultimately be used to implement new training standards to
ensure that all early career surgeons are competent. These changes are urgently needed to safeguard the
health of millions of American patients. This project will also facilitate the career development of the candidate.
The highly experienced and multidisciplinary mentorship team, the proposed career development and research
plan, and the unparalleled research environment are ideally suited to address the career goals and educational
needs of the candidate PI, Brian George, MD, MA. Although he has substantial prior experience assessing
surgical trainee performance, he has no experience using Medicare claims data to assess risk-adjusted
outcomes. These skills are necessary for him to achieve his goal of ensuring that all early career surgeons
provide safe care. This proposal therefore includes additional training which will be essential both for the
successful completion of this research and for Dr. George’s career development, including graduate level
courses in Medicare claims data analysis, the use of risk-adjusted outcomes for performance measurement,
and advanced statistical modeling. This career development award will lay the groundwork for Dr. George to
mature as an independent investigator and national leader in understanding how to ensure all surgeons
provide safe care when they enter practice."

 Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) suffer from cognitive decline, even when unaffected by stroke.
The pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in SCA is poorly understood. Understanding the mechanism and
trajectory of injury and degree of reversibility is necessary to prevent lifelong disability in this vulnerable
population. Furthermore, current screening tools are inadequate as transcranial Doppler ultrasound and
structural brain MRI only screen for risk of stroke and evaluate for presence of irreversible infarction. The long-
term goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism of brain injury with MR measures of oxygen
metabolism, structural connectivity, and functional connectivity, and develop neuroimaging biomarkers for
cognitive dysfunction in SCA.
 Children with SCA experience cerebral metabolic stress, as measured by increased oxygen extraction
fraction (OEF). OEF peaks within the deep white matter, co-localizing with the brain region at greatest risk for
stroke in SCA. Increased metabolic stress is associated with disrupted connectivity within specific functional
brain networks, and the nodes of networks with diminished functional connectivity in SCA are anatomically-
contiguous, clustered and aligned with the region of elevated OEF in the white matter. However, OEF
decreases and executive function abilities improve with a single red blood cell transfusion in children with SCA,
suggesting some aspects of cognitive dysfunction, potentially driven by alterations in FC, are acutely reversible
as metabolic stress is attenuated in SCA. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that isolated disruption of
functional connectivity caused by increased metabolic stress will be acutely reversible; however, disruption of
functional connectivity mediated by structural connectivity will be irreversible. Treatment of the former may
improve cognitive function, while treatment of the latter may mitigate progressive cognitive decline. In order to
test her hypothesis, Dr. Fields will obtain longitudinal measures, separated by three years, of cognitive testing
and brain MRIs to measure OEF, structural connectivity and functional connectivity in control, non-transfused
SCA, and transfused SCA participants. The transfused participants will undergo cognitive testing and brain
MRI before and after red blood cell transfusion at study entrance. Using this data, she will test her central
hypothesis by completing the following specific aims: 1) Determine if disruption of the structural and functional
connectome is reversible with transfusion of RBCs in SCA, 2) Determine the impact of increased OEF on the
development of the structural and functional connectome, and 3) Determine if MR metrics of metabolic stress,
SC and FC predict aberrant cognitive trajectories. Completion of these aims will provide insight into the
pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in SCA, and allow the definition and development of biomarkers for
reversible neurologic injury, which can potentially guide treatment effect, and improve outcomes in this
vulnerable population."

Fleas are obligate blood-feeding arthropods that are associated with several notable bacterial-derived human
diseases, i.e. rickettsioses, bartonelloses, and plague. Plague caused by the Gram negative bacterium, Yersinia
pestis, is difficult to eradicate because flea-borne transmission is endemic in natural foci of wild rodents and their
associated fleas world-wide. Insecticide control is the primary strategy for disease management, but like many
vector-borne diseases this is compromised by development of insecticide resistance in fleas. Development of
novel vector-based strategies for bacterial pathogen control are therefore a priority. However, to accomplish this,
we must overcome the dearth in knowledge regarding flea biology, particularly the detailed processes of the flea
host response to infection. Towards this goal our lab has recently made novel observations that the Y. pestis
factor Ymt is involved in manipulating the bloodmeal digestion processes related to detoxification of heme in a
blood source dependent manner. Our goals are to understand the Ymt-mediated flea responses to infection that
underlie successful Y. pestis infection of rat fleas. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that Ymt modulates mouse
blood digestion processes related to heme detoxification and antioxidant defense to enable Y. pestis infection in
rat fleas. Two aims will test this hypothesis. In Aim 1 we will determine if bloodmeal derived heme is correlated
with flea ROS-mediated immune responses in a Ymt and blood source dependent manner. In Aim 2 we will use
comparative transcriptomics to identify flea transcripts that are modulated in a Ymt-specific manner. Our
proposed exploratory studies have potential to uncover biological processes related to blood digestion and
immune processes in flea vectors that can be targeted to reduce establishment of transmissible infections to
humans. Therefore, the proposed research lies within a part of the NIH's mission to develop fundamental
knowledge that will assist in reducing the burden of infectious diseases on human health."
10891346,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
In this R21 application, we propose to establish a new preclinical model in aged nonhuman primates (NHP),
aiming to use it in the long run to investigate the pathophysiology of postoperative delirium (POD), which is
known to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Notably,
NHPs are the uniquely better animal model that can be used to simultaneously determine delirium-like behaviors,
invasive neural recording from human-equivalent neocortex, and blood biomarker testing in a functioning animal.
Neither humans (infeasible for invasive recording and frequent interventions) nor rodents (limited neocortex,
limited human relevance) can provide as useful of a model as NHPs can. Thus, the established NHP model will
allow us to perform better delirium studies, including mechanistic insight and targeted interventions, which will
better guide future clinical investigations of POD. Extended of our recent NHP studies, we will use a volatile
anesthetic sevoflurane and a GABA-mediated intravenous anesthetic propofol to establish the system for POD
research in NHPs. Sevoflurane has been reported for its association with POD in patients of various ages.
Propofol has not been demonstrated to promote POD in patients. Consistent with the literatures that tauopathy
is a hallmark of AD neuropathogenesis, our previous works show that general anesthetics may promote tau
phosphorylation in mice and that the patients who developed POD might have higher preoperative and
postoperative blood tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels. Thus, we hypothesize that sevoflurane, but not
propofol, promotes delirium-like behaviors and working memory impairment, induces specific cortical
neurophysiological changes, and increases plasma p-tau levels in aged monkeys as compared to young adult
monkeys. The Specific Aims are: (1) to determine whether sevoflurane promotes delirium-like behaviors
(inattention, altered level of consciousness, hallucinations, and locomotor stereotypies), deficits in working
memory (in Delayed Matching-to-Sample task), and cortical neural changes in aged monkeys as compared to
propofol; and (2) to assess the effect of sevoflurane and propofol on plasma p-tau levels in aged monkeys. We
will perform direct intracortical recording in the central (frontoparietal) executive network (dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, posterior parietal cortex), which activities are thought to be associated with delirium and working memory.
We will employ a novel nanotechnology to measure blood biomarkers for neuronal injury, plasma tau and p-tau
(p-tau217, p-tau181) levels. These measurements will be performed before and after anesthesia up to 3 months.
The proposed studies will establish a novel NHP model for the investigation of POD and facilitate validating
neurophysiological and blood biomarkers of delirium. Using data from this study we will apply for a R01 to
systematically study the pathophysiology of POD in aged NHPs with AD pathology, an advanced model for the
most vulnerable population."

expression and cell surface proteins to unravel mechanisms of cellular diversity
Arima Genomics
Project Summary/Abstract
All cells in the human body carry the same DNA sequence and yet individual cells are highly diverse in identity,
morphology, proliferation, and function, leading to enormous heterogeneity in the context of tissues, organs, and
organisms. Individual cells achieve this diversity via unique gene regulatory programs – where in, unique sets of
regulatory elements (REs) precisely instruct each cell which genes to express and when. Mapping such gene
regulatory programs are central to molecular biology and genomics, as mis-regulation is a major cause of disease
– mapping not only helps in diagnosis but also enables therapies that can intervene and correct mis-regulation.
Single cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC) has emerged as the popular mapping assay to delineate REs unique to
each cell. When scATAC is performed alongside single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA), the researcher has
access to both REs and gene expression, allowing them to obtain unprecedented insight into the gene regulatory
programs of living cells. There is only one problem – there are often multiple REs in the neighborhood of a gene
and without the ability to link specific REs to its target genes, a mechanistic view of gene regulation is lacking,
limiting our ability to enable precise diagnosis and drug discovery programs.
High throughput chromatin interaction capture assay and sequencing (HiC) presents a three-dimensional view
of the genome, often informing the missing link between RE and their target genes. Indeed, several KOLs – e.g.,
Dr. Tomi Pastinen calls scATAC, scRNA and scHiC as the “trifecta of modalities” that can truly delineate gene
regulatory programs of individual cells (see Dr. Pastinen’s letter and 30+ additional letters of support).
Recognizing the value, several academic labs have developed scHiC protocols, which has already unraveled
incredibly detailed mechanistic insights of gene regulation of complex microenvironments including breast
cancer, prostate cancer, hippocampus – several of these studies are discussed in this application. Despite the
enthusiasm around scHiC data, adoption has been restricted to a few labs because of (1) severe experimental
inefficiencies that result in exorbitant costs (upwards of $20,000 per sample), and (2) because current scHiC
protocols involve complex plate- or combinatorial indexing workflows that are challenging to setup and execute.
Via a self-funded phase-1 program, we tackled problem (1) to drastically improve efficiency of scHiC and
consequently, drive costs down from earlier $10 per cell, to <$2 per cell, details of which are discussed both in
research and commercial plans. We then used our rigorous product development expertise to translate the
resultant scHiC chemistry into kits that were extensively validated by multiple KOLs (see letters from Joe Ecker,
Longzhi Tan and others). Upon validation, these KOLs have become customers using Arima’s scHiC, referred
to as A-scHiC kits, in their single cell workflows instead of the inefficient former academic protocols. Webinars
and conference presentations from these early adopters created a ripple in the community and in a span of few
months, we have sold >1,000 reactions of A-scHiC kits to tens of academic labs (despite no marketing activity
from Arima), who have embedded our kits within both the plate- and combinatorial indexing single cell workflows.
The scope of phase-2 program is to tackle problem (2) to enable widespread adoption. In particular, we propose
to build off the A-scHiC chemistry toward what we refer to as the sc3DGR chemistry that is performed upstream
of 10X genomics (10XG) Chromium – i.e., the output of sc3DGR kit will be an input into the 10X ATAC (flavor1)
or 10X Multiome (flavor2) kits, to concurrently capture scHiC and scATAC (flavor1), or, scHiC, scATAC and
scRNA (flavor2), respectively. Such a chemistry will not only solve the ease to use problem (2) given its
combability with the market leader 10XG, but importantly, it will enable multiomic analyses of the “trifecta” from
the same individual cell concurrently, thus enabling cell perturbation, characterization and screening use-cases
for precision mapping, diagnosis, and therapy. Once the sc3DGR chemistry is finalized, we translate it into robust
kits, to be validated by 14 KOLs (see letters of support) across academia and pharma (AbbVie, AstraZeneca &
Genentech). For Arima, the chemistry, the informatics, the easy end-to-end workflows, the overall workflow cost,
the KOL-based go-to-market strategy – all play major factors in a seamless commercialization process of this
leapfrog technology for delineating gene regulation programs of individual cells."
10846717,"Abstract. Bone marrow is one of the most radiation-sensitive tissues, and patients acutely exposed to total
body irradiation (TBI) doses > 2 Gy develop severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and lymphopenia
within days to weeks of exposure, often dying from infections (due to a lack of neutrophils) and uncontrolled
bleeding (insufficient platelets) (referred to as the hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome, or H-ARS). The few
drugs that have received FDA approval to treat H-ARS increase survival when administered within 24h of
radiation exposure, but do not increase survival when administered at later times such as 48h post-irradiation
in animal H-ARS models. In a radiological/nuclear emergency, hundreds of thousands of people potentially will
be exposed to > 2 Gy radiation and it is extremely unlikely that they all can be treated within the first 24 hours
of radiation exposure. Thus, there is a critical unmet medical need for drugs capable of increasing survival
from H-ARS when administered 48h or later post-irradiation. We demonstrated that a novel drug (PEG IL-11)
and 3 drug combination including PEG IL-11 significantly improve 30d and 180d survival of LD70/30 irradiated
mice when administered once 48h post-TBI. This is the only drug/drug combination we are aware of capable of
increasing survival when dosing is delayed until 48h post-TBI in mice. When dosed once 24h or 48h post-TBI,
the 3 proteins interact positively with each other to increase survival more than the individual proteins, most
evident at high TBI doses. The 3 protein combination and PEG IL-11 show sex-specific survival effects, up to
100% survival at LD95/30 TBI doses, when combined with a 4th radiation mitigator, an angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), an unprecedented survival rate. Most H-ARS studies to date have used inbred young
adult mice. Since mouse strains and different age mice show different radiation sensitivities, the Phase 2 grant
will evaluate whether these exciting findings extend to pediatric mice and outbred mice to determine whether
the survival efficacy and sex-specific effects of the proteins (+/- ACEI) are universal or mouse strain / age
specific. We will evaluate whether (1) PEG IL-11 and the 3 protein combination (+/- the ACEI) increase
survival of pediatric and outbred mice exposed to LD70/30 radiation doses when the proteins are administered
24 and 48h post-TBI; (2) whether increased 30d survival correlates with accelerated peripheral blood cell
recovery (neutrophils, platelets) and more rapid increases in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell numbers
early after irradiation; and (3) whether drug treatment and increased survival correlate with specific plasma
biomarker changes. We will evaluate safety of different doses of PEG IL-1 in a mouse GLP toxicology study to
identify safe doses of the drug for use in humans, and manufacture a GMP lot of the protein, both of which are
required for filing an IND to begin testing the protein in humans. PEG IL-11 and TC are potential life-saving
treatment options for a heretofore untreatable H-ARS population – patients who cannot be treated until 48h or
later post-TBI."

the CEP may also influence the efficacy of cell-based biologic therapies designed to regenerate the disc, as
these therapies increase intradiscal nutrient demands. The premise of this proposal is that non-invasive
assessment of CEP composition could provide insight into disc degeneration etiology and guide patient selection
for cell-based biologic therapies, in turn helping to address the global health burden associated with cLBP.
 A novel imaging biomarker of CEP composition—the mean CEP T2* relaxation time measured using ultra-
short echo time (UTE) MRI—has recently been shown to correlate with aspects of CEP composition influencing
nutrient transport to the disc and the extent of disc degeneration in patients with cLBP. This non-invasive
biomarker has major implications for elucidating the role of the CEP in disc degeneration/regeneration. However,
the MR signal generated by the CEP depends on its in situ orientation relative in the MRI bore. Differences in
T2* caused by orientation during imaging could exceed those associated with biochemical or microstructural
deterioration, thus confounding accurate analysis. Without understanding the effects of orientation on CEP T2*
values, researchers—and eventually clinicians—cannot accurately assess CEP composition in patients.
 The studies proposed here address these limitations and facilitate the development and clinical translation
of MRI-based biomarkers of CEP composition independent of inter- and intra-individual anatomic variations in
CEP orientation. Aim 1a will image cadaveric motion segments with UTE MRI at varying angles to develop a
calibration curve for adjusting CEP T2* values based on in situ orientation. Aim 1b will test the clinical utility of
this calibration curve in clinical cohorts of patients with cLBP and asymptomatic controls imaged with UTE MRI.
Aim 2 will quantify the contributions of CEP microstructure and biochemical composition to inter- and intra-CEP
variations in CEP T2* values, enhancing mechanistic understanding of the factors influencing CEP T2* and thus
the diagnostic interpretation of UTE-based CEP biomarkers.
 The proposed training plan involves developing expertise in advanced techniques in MRI, biochemical and
microstructural characterization of musculoskeletal tissues, mathematical and statistical modeling, and concepts
in clinical medicine with a focus on cLBP. The fellowship is supported by two sponsors—Dr. Aaron Fields
(primary sponsor, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery) and Dr. Roland Krug (co-sponsor, Department of
Radiology)—who have deep domain expertise in the proposed research areas. The work will be conducted at
the University of California, San Francisco, one of the premier biomedical and life sciences research centers in
the world."
10739805,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mosquito-borne disease is a major source of human misery, sickening hundreds of millions and killing
hundreds of thousands of people annually. The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is a primary vector for the
viruses that cause dengue, Zika and chikungunya and other diseases. In addition to its medical importance, Ae.
aegypti is increasingly used for molecular genetic studies of mosquito vector biology. Understanding Ae.
aegypti biology will provide basic science insights into this mosquito vector’s development, physiology and
behavior, help inform implementation of control efforts and potentially suggest new control strategies.
Improving approaches for genetic investigations in Ae. aegypti will facilitate these efforts.
 To date, genetic investigations in Ae. aegypti often rely on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting to
create strains of homozygous mutant animals in which a gene of interest has been disrupted. While extremely
valuable, substantial effort is required to create each mutant and the mutants obtained lack cell-specificity. To
address these limitations, we propose to establish a cell-specific, modified CRISPR/Cas9 (CmC) toolkit for Ae.
aegypti. CmC is designed to decrease the effort required to examine the impact of disrupting a gene of interest,
allow the cells in which a gene is acting to be determined and aid the study of essential genes.
We propose to achieve these goals in two aims:
Aim #1: Introduce the tools for Cell-specific modified CRISPR/Cas9 (CmC) into Ae. aegypti
In aim 1a, we design a strategy and build tools for creating mosquito strains that express modified Cas9
transgenes designed to allow optimization of Cas9 levels. In aim 1a2, we use these tools to create mosquitoes
that express modified Cas9 transgenes in a specific subset of sensory neurons. In aim 1b, we create transgenes
that express multiple gRNAs in a cell-specific fashion to specify the genes targeted.
Aim 2: Implement CmC in a subset of sensory neurons as well as pan-neuronally
In aim 2a, we test the system, using the tools built to identify an optimal strain which promotes robust cell-
specific gene disruption in a subset of sensory neurons, without causing cell death. In aim 2b, we construct
mosquito strains that will enable broad neuron-specific gene disruption, which should be of wide utility."
10909803,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (TR) are essential for establishing and maintaining immune tolerance, and manipulating
TR activity is an attractive new therapeutic strategy for treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The
development, homeostasis and function of TR depends on the cytokine IL-2, and TR constitutively express the
high affinity IL-2 receptor which allows them to compete for limiting IL-2 produced by activated CD4+ T cells. As
a strategy for increasing TR abundance and function to treat autoimmune disease, we have developed a novel
IL-2 ‘mutein’ that is highly TR selective, potently expands TR in vivo, and arrests ongoing autoimmunity and
induces durable disease protection in NOD mice. Interestingly, we have shown that in both mice and humans,
IL-2 mutien treatment is associated with pronounced expansion of a subset of highly activated TR characterized
by expression of activation markers associated with T cell receptor stimulation. Furthermore, expanded TR
express high levels of the immunosuppressive molecule CTLA4, and IL-2 mutein treatment inhibits the activation
of dendritic cells (DCs) and their surface expression of the key co-stimulatory ligands CD80 and CD86 that are
required for full effector T cell activation. Based on these results, we hypothesize that IL-2 mutein treatment
promotes TR/DC interaction, and that this results in synergistic IL-2 and TCR signaling that drives the proliferation
and expansion of highly activated TR that inhibit DC function and prevent the activation, differentiation and
function of autoreactive T cells. In this proposal we use a number of innovative methods to test this hypothesis,
and these experiments will provide a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how IL-2 muteins function to
promote TR expansion and induction of immune tolerance. This has important implications for the translation of
IL-2 muteins into therapeutic use, and will provide important new insights in the basic biology of IL-2-mediated
control of TR homeostasis and function."
10817775,"Preterm birth (PTB) affects 10-15% of pregnancies in the US and causes the majority of neonatal mortality and morbidity. To prevent PTB a clearer understanding is needed of the hormonal control of human parturition. In this regard, the steroid hormone progesterone (P4) acting via the nuclear P4 receptor (PR) isoforms, PR-A and PR-B, is a critical factor. For most of pregnancy P4/PR promotes uterine quiescence and blocks labor, and disruption of P4/PR signaling triggers parturition. The mechanism for these critical P4/PR actions are, however, unclear. Infection/inflammation in the uterine and gestational tissues are major drivers of term and preterm parturition, but the mechanism for these effects are also uncertain. The proposed research addresses these major knowledge gaps by exploring a mechanism linking inflammation and P4/PR signaling in myometrial cells via a phosphorylated form of PR-A that we hypothesize plays a central role in the causal pathway for inflammation-induced parturition. Our published and preliminary data suggest that P4/PR-B inhibits myometrial cell responsiveness to pro-inflammatory stimuli by interacting with and repressing the transcriptional activity of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factors at promotors of a subset of IL-1ß-responsive genes. Our data also suggest that P4/PR-A upon phosphorylation at the serine-344/345 locus (pSer344/345-PRA) interacts with AP-1 to disrupt P4/PR-B anti-inflammatory activity. We also found that generation of pSer344/345-PRA in myometrial cells is catalyzed by mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Based on those data we hypothesize that: 1) P4/PR-B exerts anti-inflammatory activity in myometrial cells by binding to AP-1 to inhibit transcription at a subset of inflammatory gene promoters; 2) pSer344/345-PRA inhibits P4/PR-B anti-inflammatory activity by disrupting the PR-B/AP-1 interaction, and 3) generation of pSer344/345-PRA in myometrial cells is catalyzed by specific MAPKs in response to pro-inflammation stimuli. This hypothesis will be tested in human myometrial cell lines and human myometrium obtained from c-section deliveries, and Rhesus macaque and mouse models of inflammation induced parturition. Two Specific Aims will be achieved: Specific Aim 1: Determine the mechanism by which P4/PR-B exerts anti-inflammatory activity in myometrial cells and how this is affected by pSer344/345-PRA; and Specific Aim 2: Determine how pSer344/345- PRA generation is controlled in myometrial cells. The proposed research is novel and groundbreaking and will advance understanding of the fundamental biology of human parturition and contribute to the development of effective P4/PR-based anti-inflammatory therapies to promote uterine quiescence and prevent preterm birth."
10861880,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cannabis and alcohol are two of the most commonly used drugs in the world and are often used concurrently
(i.e., “co-used”). When used independently, both cannabis and alcohol can impair psychomotor skills, attention,
and cognitive functioning and ultimately, negatively impact driving performance and functioning in the
workplace. Prior laboratory studies have shown that cannabis/alcohol co-use can produce additive effects on
impairment, over and above impairment caused by either substance alone, and epidemiological studies show
that the risk for car accidents is significantly increased when a person has used both cannabis and alcohol.
Importantly, previous controlled studies on cannabis/alcohol co-use have focused almost exclusively on
smoked forms of cannabis, but many novel cannabis products have emerged in recent years. In our prior
laboratory studies, we have found that the acute effects of oral cannabis products (“edibles”) and cannabis
vaporizers (two popular novel forms of cannabis), differ markedly from smoked cannabis. These findings
suggest that oral and vaporized cannabis may interact with alcohol in distinct ways from smoked cannabis.
The aim of this project is to systematically evaluate the acute impairing effects of cannabis and alcohol, when
administered alone and together, in two human laboratory studies that will utilize rigorous double-blind, double-
dummy, placebo-controlled designs. The studies will differ by route of cannabis administration (Study 1: oral;
Study 2: vaporized), but will otherwise use essentially the same protocol. In each study, participants will
complete 7 outpatient drug administration sessions in which they self-administer placebo or active cannabis
(10 or 25 mg THC) and a placebo drink or alcohol drink calculated to produce a breath alcohol concentration
(BAC) of 0.05%. Participants will also complete a positive control session in which they administer placebo
cannabis and alcohol for a target BAC of 0.08% (the legal threshold, or “per se limit,” for driving impairment in
most U.S. states). Sessions will be completed in a randomized order and separated by at least one week.
Assessments will include a state-of-the-art driving simulator, a battery of cognitive/psychomotor performance
tasks, field sobriety tests, and subjective drug effect questionnaires. This research can inform impairment
detection standards for individuals who have co-used cannabis and alcohol (e.g., determine if 0.08% BAC is a
suitable alcohol intoxication threshold if a person has also used cannabis) which can inform whether there is a
need to adjust BAC per se limits in locations where cannabis is legal. Moreover, this study will evaluate a
promising novel cannabis impairment detection tool (the DRUID app) which could be invaluable to public safety
because current approaches to identifying cannabis impairment (e.g., per se limits for blood THC) are largely
ineffective. Lastly, these findings will help guide regulatory decisions concerning the allowance of commercial
establishments that sell both alcohol and cannabis as well as products that contain both alcohol and THC."

This application seeks to renew the Neurobiology of Information Storage Training Program (NISTP), which is
devoted to preparing exceptional predoctoral students for research-intensive careers in the science of learning
and memory. Active since 2003, the program is focused on training in fundamental mechanisms of information
storage in animals and humans, acting as a central organizer for research in this area at Northwestern. With
the recent shift in mental health research toward dimensional, systems-based frameworks, there is
unprecedented need for training of the kind offered through this program, which provides training at multiple
levels of analyses for understanding mechanisms of learning and memory and their relevance to mental health.
The NISTP is based in the Northwestern University Interdepartmental Neuroscience (NUIN) program,
emerging from a multidisciplinary group of 31 interactive investigators who have successfully engaged in
collaborative research on molecular/genetic, cellular/circuit, and systems/behavioral determinants of
information storage. NISTP preceptors have strong track records in predoctoral training and well-funded
research programs, and can impart both basic and clinical perspectives to a group of outstanding developing
scientists. Training components of the NISTP will include: 1) an advanced course in the latest research in
information storage neurobiology, taught by NISTP preceptors; 2) two trainee-hosted lecture series featuring
leading investigators in the field of information storage; 3) mock study sections for trainees preparing NRSA
applications; and 4) quarterly NISTP meetings including a) “research in progress” trainee talks, b) “bench to
bedside” translational discussions, c) “computational modeling and memory” interactive discussions, and d) the
annual NISTP retreat. NISTP also serves to educate students in the ethics of science and to recruit students
from underrepresented groups to study learning and memory. Continuous evaluation of the program will be
accomplished using qualitative mechanisms, such as evaluations by trainees and their mentors, and
quantitative measures, such as tracking the research productivity, funding, and career trajectories of former
trainees. An internal Steering Committee and an External Advisory Committee will conduct additional
assessment processes. Trainees are drawn primarily from a pool of NUIN students who have completed most
of the required coursework and have made significant progress in their thesis research. We request continued
support for five trainee slots, which will be supplemented with one institutionally funded “affiliate” slot. With the
value added by the NISTP, we are confident that NISTP trainees will emerge from their graduate training
poised to advance research in fundamental biological mechanisms of learning and memory and well positioned
to develop novel translational applications."

 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 26–30 million U.S. adults and remains a major public health problem
(1; 2). Renal fibrosis is the inevitable consequence of almost every type of CKD regardless of underlying
etiology, and leads to progressive renal failure and end-stage of renal disease (ESRD) (1). Thus, preventing
renal fibrosis may in turn prevent progression of CKD and ESRD. While there is compelling literature
suggesting many potential therapeutic targets for treating renal fibrosis, very few have advanced to the initial
phase of clinical trials (3; 4), and none have shown efficacy in the treatment of renal fibrosis (4). Thus, it is
crucial to continue to discover and test novel potential therapeutic targets for renal fibrosis.
 Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) is a common and well-validated renal fibrosis experimental model.
Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) isoforms are multifunctional cytokines that play a central role in
driving fibrosis in most, if not all, forms of CKD (5). Big potassium (BK) channels (also called Big-K, Maxi-K or
Slo1 channels) are K+ channels and may be one novel target that plays a major role in renal fibrosis. BK
channels consist of the α-subunit (BKα), which functions as a channel independently, β-subunits (β1-4), and
the γ-subunit (6; 7). A recent study reported that BK channel β1-subunit deficiency exacerbates vascular
fibrosis and remodeling in high-fat fed obesity mice, suggesting that reduced BKα sensitivity and activity
caused by β1 deficiency (8) leads to vascular fibrosis (9). We have compelling preliminary evidence that shows
for the first time that BKα also plays a critical role in renal fibrosis. While BKα knockout (KO) mice were prone
to developing more severe fibrosis after UUO (Figure 1), pre-treatment with the BK channel opener,
BMS191011 (Sigma-Aldrich, SML0866), that can activate BK channels (10), protected mice from developing
renal fibrosis in wild-type (WT) UUO mice (Figure 2) by suppressing TGF-β1 signaling pathway (Figures 3-4).
These data suggest that the BK channel plays an important role in the development of renal fibrosis.
Thus, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the role of BK channel in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis is of
utmost clinical importance. Our overall hypothesis is that BK channel deficiency is prone to developing
renal fibrosis via activating the TGF-β signaling pathway in renal fibrotic mouse models. In this
application we will propose three specific aims to test our overall hypothesis:
 Specific Aim 1: To validate the role of the BK channels in the development of renal fibrosis in
different renal fibrosis mouse models.
 Specific Aim 2: To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the BK-mediated development
of renal fibrosis.
 Specific Aim 3: To translate the experimental findings by examining whether BK expression levels
are correlated with the severity of renal fibrosis in CKD patients.
 SA3.1. Determine whether BK expression levels are quantifiably correlated to the severity of renal fibrosis in
kidney biopsy samples from CKD patients with diabetic nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
(FSGS).
 Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the BK-mediated development of renal fibrosis will
provide novel insights into whether BK channels can be utilized as a potential therapeutic target for treating
CKD patients and preventing them from progressing to ESRD."
10871817,"This proposal focuses on development of a new treatment for patients with heart failure and preserved
ejection fraction (HFpEF). Among symptomatic patients with HF, half have HFpEF, and their mortality is
similar to those with HFrEF. However, there are currently no treatments for HFpEF that prolong life, and
few (if any) that reliably reduce HF hospitalization rates. We need new therapies to address this unmet
medical need. Cardiovascular gene transfer is conceptually an attractive method for treating HF, but
difficulty in obtaining high yield transgene expression in the heart in a manner that can be easily and safely
applied has been challenging. However, we recently have demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous
(i.v.) delivery of a long-term expression vector (AAV8) encoding a peptide, urocortin 2 (Ucn2), which
possesses favorable cardiovascular effects through its paracrine/endocrine actions. In our current VA Merit
grant we have established the safety and efficacy of a 1-time i.v. administration of AAV8.Ucn2 in two
murine models of HFpEF—aging and pressure overload, two risk factors for clinical HFpEF. However,
there are several important issues that must be resolved prior to clinical translation of this much-needed
therapy.
Hypothesis: Ucn2/Ucn3 gene transfer, through paracrine/endocrine effects, will improve cardiac function
 and survival in two models of HFpEF (in different species) via corticotropin releasing hormone
 receptor 2 (CRHR2)-dependent enhancement of Ca2+ handling in cardiac myocytes
Aim 1: To determine the effectiveness and survival advantage of Ucn2 vs Ucn3 gene transfer in a model
 of HFpEF due to hypertension (Dahl Salt-Sensitive Rat)
Aim 2a: To determine if the beneficial effects of Ucn2 gene transfer on LV function in aged mice are
 abrogated by cardiac-targeted deletion of CRHR2
Aim 2b: To determine whether the beneficial effects of Ucn2 gene transfer on the aged LV result from
 enhanced Ca2+ handling and increased rates of sarcomere shortening and lengthening
Aim 3: To determine the intracellular mechanisms linking Ucn2 and Ucn3 peptide activation of CRHR2
 with enhanced Ca2+ handling in cultured cardiac myocytes
These Aims are designed to answer key questions: 1) Will the benefits of Ucn2 gene transfer be seen in a
second species in a second model of HFpEF (hypertensive Dahl Salt-Sensitive rats), will it confer a survival
advantage, and will Ucn3 gene transfer have similar beneficial effects? These questions will be addressed
in Aim 1; 2) To what degree are the beneficial effects of Ucn2 gene transfer due to cardiac CRHR2
activation vs systemic vasodilation due to activation of CRHR2 in smooth muscle and attendant systemic
vasodilation? We will address this question by using cardiac-targeted deletion of CRHR2 (Aim 2);
3) Finally, we propose to map the intracellular pathways (mechanisms) from CM CRHR2 stimulation by
Ucn2/Ucn3 to the predicted increase in Ca2+ handling in a series of studies conducted in isolated CMs
(Aim 3). These preclinical studies, which are focused on mechanism of action and effectiveness of
treatment in vivo will serve as a segue for an additional study in a large mammalian model of HFpEF under
separate funding, and subsequently to the filing of an IND application for the initiation of a clinical trial, a
transition we have made in our laboratory twice previously (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00787059 and
NCT00346437)."

 In many surgical procedures, image guided surgery (IGS), also known as surgical navigation, facilitates
precise surgical manipulations near critical structures such as the brain and eye. IGS suffers from critical
limitations such as loss of precision and correspondence with preoperative imaging once surgery begins and
the anatomy is altered. These limitations may be addressed through intra-operative imaging, which effectively
“resets” the model and thus enables both improved precision of IGS as well as improved surgical decision-
making. However, intraoperative radiologic imaging has many limitations, including disruption of the workflow,
cost, and additional radiation exposure. This project aims to develop solutions to resolve limitations of IGS
without the need for intra-operative radiologic imaging. Our solutions rely upon data from a device that is
present in every procedure using IGS, namely, the endoscope. Our goal in this project is use endoscopic video
images to reconstruct surgical anatomy as it changes. This enables sustained precision in registration with pre-
operative imaging throughout the procedure by updating the anatomical model as surgery progresses. We will
achieve this by 1) using advances in computer vision to develop improved methods for continuous direct
registration between the endoscope and the CT; and 2) developing methods that continuously compute the
geometry of observed surfaces and update the preoperative CT with changes in that geometry. The technology
developed in this proposal thus enables the following: 1) precise surgical navigation using the endoscope
throughout the procedure; 2) surgical decision-making without the need for additional intra-operative imaging;
and 3) new tools to reconstruct surgical anatomy and quantitatively evaluate the extent of surgery."

The long-term health of the lung and other tissues is inextricably linked to the sustainability of the protein fold 
and its function. Fold and function are tightly coupled to the energetic health of the cell. This is achieved by the 
emerging paradigm of harmonization of cell function (DNA, RNA and protein) with protein homeostasis or 
proteostasis, a collection of integrated biological pathways that generate, maintain and repair the proteome. 
Efforts in the previous funding period revealed the importance of both proteostasis sensitive pathways and the 
mitochondria in management of the aging lung, pathways that are responsive to the life-span extending drug 
metformin that is thought to impact the function of mitochondrial complex I, and ISRIB, which our preliminary 
data suggests accelerates lung repair in a variety of injury models. 
In Core B, we will quantitatively track changes in proteostasis during recovery from influenza A-induced tissue 
injury using integrated bulk and single cell RNA-Seq, spatial transcriptomics and rigorous mass spectrometry 
(MS) approaches. We will apply these approaches to high quality flow cytometry sorted samples of lung, skeletal 
muscle and brain tissue from aged mice provided by Core C. Our computational groups at Northwestern and 
Scripps Research interact freely via shared electronic platforms. They will use these data to create a multi- 
dimensional understanding of the impaired recovery from influenza A infection in older animals. Core B will 
couple these powerful technologies with the genetic and pharmacologic studies the investigators propose to 
manipulate mitochondrial complex I function, the integrated stress response and ATF4 over the lifespan. We will 
support these important studies in aging biology by focusing on three Specific Aims: 
 Aim 1: To provide bulk and single cell RNA-Seq and spatial transcriptomic data using flow-sorted 
 cell populations and homogenized tissues provided by Core C. 
 Aim 2: To provide mass spectroscopy analyses from flow-sorted cell populations obtained from 
 the lung, brain and skeletal muscle of aged animals. 
 Aim 3. To use advanced machine learning and system science tools to couple genetic and 
 pharmacologic interventions during aging with multi-omic experimental data from aging animals. 
While the methods employed in this Core are inherently unbiased, we take advantage of the special expertise 
within this Core and the PPG to focus on proteostasis, macrophage biology and metabolism over the lifespan. 
By providing simultaneous RNA-Seq and proteomic analysis of alveolar type II cells, alveolar macrophages, 
Core B we will create a multi-omic genotype to phenotype map of tissue recovery after injury during aging that 
will be broadly applicable to other environmental challenges that limit healthspan."

Mechanical forces play key roles throughout biology, from governing the adhesion of leukocytes in the immune
response, to determining cell fate and directing tissue formation. This field of mechanobiology is providing vital
insights into conditions such as bleeding disorders, cancer, and infectious diseases, where it is becoming clear
that conventional biochemical and genomic characterizations are not sufficient to understand the rich behavior
of living systems or how they fail. Rather, we must uncover how force changes the structure and function of
molecules, triggering mechanotransduction pathways to modify cell responses. Technological developments
that enable precise manipulation of single molecules and cells have been a driving force in the development of
the field, but growth has been impeded by both limited access to such technologies and by constraints in their
capabilities, which has restricted the types of scientific questions that can be addressed.
To overcome these challenges, we will develop approaches in mechanobiology that will (i) open up new areas
of study through the introduction of new capabilities, and (ii) democratize single-molecule and nanoscale
methods so that all biomedical researchers can make discoveries using these powerful tools. We will continue
to develop instruments such as the Centrifuge Force Microscope, a miniature microscope that fits into a
benchtop centrifuge to enable even non-specialists to perform high-throughput single-molecule force
measurements, and nanoscale devices such as programmable DNA nanoswitches. We will develop DNA
nanoswitch calipers, a tool capable of measuring distances on single-molecules with angstrom-level precision
to enable single-molecule protein identification and shape determination. We will also develop Functional
Interaction-based Nanoswitch Discovery (FIND), a high-throughput screening assay based not on traditional
robotics, but on molecular devices that bring together molecular components to analyze and screen for
interactions of interest. FIND will enable screening of complex modes of action to find compounds that activate
a specific downstream pathway or allosterically stabilize a particular protein conformation.
We will apply our nanoscale approaches to answer key open questions in mechanobiology. For example, to
uncover the mechanical regulation of hemostasis we will use single-molecule methods to study the force-
regulated enzymatic cleavage of von Willebrand factor, and the flow-induced elongation and activation of its
adhesive function. We will also investigate the molecular basis of hearing and deafness by using single-
molecule force spectroscopy to probe the properties of the hair cell tip link, and combine this approach with
single-channel conductance measurements to simultaneously measure the force required to open
mechanotransduction channels and the molecular movements that underlie channel gating. Overall, these
efforts should firmly establish force as a key parameter for understanding the basic processes of life, and
provide a new handle for both understanding—and treating—disease."

Thousands of genetic loci are associated with human traits or disease risk, and these loci each typically contain
tens to hundreds of variants, most of which are non-coding and lack direct evidence of effects on genes.
Experimental tests of genomic variants are needed to identify functional effects, which can be specific to one
sex, tissue, and/or perturbed environmental context. Testing effects of risk variants on gene regulation requires
an ability to quantify the potentially modest consequences of thousands of alleles in a carefully controlled study.
Our overarching goal is to systematically characterize the impact of human genetic variation on gene regulation
via massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA). We will select variants based primarily on genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) for common diseases and complex traits relevant to the brain, liver, lung, muscle,
and/or heart. We will examine all plausible functional candidates at prioritized GWAS loci to provide data for tests
of regulatory variant prediction algorithms, positive control variants, and variants prioritized based on regulatory
element annotations. The gene regulatory effect of ~500,000 variant alleles will be interrogated in five organs
(brain, liver, lung, muscle and heart) using systemic circulation of adeno-associated viral (AAV) MPRA libraries.
We will repeat this experiment in a perturbed inflammatory state to evaluate gene-environment interactions. As
a result, we will comprehensively characterize variant effects on regulatory function by analyses of variants in
the physiological conditions of multiple tissues, in both sexes, with and without perturbation typical of disease
environments. Selected variants will be edited into human pluripotent cells for validation. As members of the
Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium, we will generate a regulatory variant catalog for
the community, and enable future studies through data collection and predictive models. Successful completion
of these aims will provide ~10 million allelic effect data points that encompass tissue-, sex-, and perturbation-
specific regulatory effects. We will work with the IGVF consortium to finalize selection of variants, organs, and
perturbations to generate a comprehensive catalog. The expertise of the study investigators in GWAS, statistical
and computational genetics, human genomics, AAV delivery, and mouse physiology make achievement of these
aims feasible and likely highly informative to understand how genomic variation impacts human health and
disease."
10884175,"Late onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a progressive irreversible senile dementia, is the sixth leading cause of
death in the elderly, with an estimated 5.7 million Americans afflicted by this debilitating disorder. These numbers
are expected to double in the next 20 years, presenting a significant emotional and economic burden. While AD
research continues to be a priority, little headway has been made in slowing disease progression, let alone curing
it. Early hypotheses regarding the cause of AD included infectious paradigms, but these ideas were largely
discarded as the understanding of the pathogenic role of amyloid β (Aβ) grew and the genetic underpinnings of
early onset AD were identified. However, new data has led researchers to once again suggest that infections
may play a developmental and/or accelerating role in AD progression. Among infectious organisms, Chlamydia
pneumoniae (Cp) has been identified as the leading candidate for a pathogenic role in AD. Cp, a common cause
of community-acquired pneumonia, has been linked to many chronic inflammatory diseases, including
atherosclerosis, asthma, lung cancer, and AD. In addition to an association between anti-Cp antibody titer and
AD, several studies have identified Cp in the brains of AD patients. However, the mechanisms by which Cp
infection may alter AD pathogenesis are unknown, and no definitive mouse studies have been performed.
Inflammatory cytokines like NLRP3/IL-1β and IL17, both involved in Cp infection induced pathology, may be the
key drivers for infection –mediated acceleration of AD, and will be targeted in this application. In a preliminary
study we found Cp antigens colocalizing with activated microglia in the brains of Cp infected APPSWE/PS1ΔE9
mice, clearly placing Cp in the right location to influence AD progression. We were also able to identify ASC
specks (active inflammasome) in the brains of these mice. Our expertise in Cp infection and immune responses,
in combination with our co-PI's expertise in AD, puts us in a uniquely strong position to investigate the relationship
between Cp infection and AD, and the potential of antibiotic therapy in Cp-accelerated AD. Based on these data,
we hypothesize that Cp infection plays a role in progression and/or development of Alzheimer's Disease,
which is preventable by early antibiotic treatment, and that Cp effects are at least partially mediated
through activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-17A. In order to test these hypotheses, we will
investigate the following AIMS: 1) Determine the effect of Cp infection on disease progression in
APPSWE/PS1∆E9 (ADtg) mice and 2) Determine the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in Cp infection-
modulated AD pathology in ADtg mice and in patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
3) Determine the role of IL-17A in Cp infection-modulated AD-like pathology in ADtg mice. The completion
of our proposal will lay the groundwork for understanding what possible role Cp infection plays in AD.
Furthermore, these data will be used as the basis for future research understanding the mechanisms involved
Cp infection role in AD with the ultimate goal leading to new therapeutic approaches for this devastating disease."

With the ability to silence individual genes and to drug the ‘undruggable’, RNA interference (RNAi) therapy has
recently shown clinical success by delivering small interfering RNA (siRNA) to the liver for genetic diseases.
However, new delivery strategies will be needed to expand the targeting possibilities of siRNA therapy beyond
the liver for treatment of other diseases like atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We have therefore formed a
team with complementary expertise in siRNA delivery and atherosclerosis, and developed a targeted siRNA
delivery strategy to silence calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase-IIγ (CaMKIIγ), a kinase that is activated in the
macrophages of human and mouse advanced atherosclerotic lesions and promotes progression of clinically
dangerous plaques. We showed that targeted siCamk2g treatment improved plaque stability by reducing necrotic
core area and increasing fibrous cap thickness. Nevertheless, due to the transient nature of siRNA-mediated
gene silencing, a critical challenge for siRNA therapy is the short duration of action. In this project, we propose
to i) explore a novel siRNA delivery strategy that can dramatically extend the duration of CaMKIIγ silencing in
atherosclerotic lesional macrophages; and ii) engineer the new siCamk2g platform for dual-cell targeting for
integrated treatment of obesity-induced type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. Our new preliminary work has
identified a distinct type of synthetic lipid-poly(ethylene glycol) (lipid-PEG) biomaterials that can markedly prolong
siRNA silencing and its blood circulation. We thus hypothesize that the new lipid-PEG-mediated long-acting
siCamk2g therapy could effectively target both atherosclerosis and insulin resistance with low dosing frequency.
In Aim 1, we will synthesize a series of such distinct lipid-PEG biomaterials; systematically explore the lipid-PEG
effects on the duration of action and pharmacokinetics of siRNA; and optimize the unique siRNA delivery platform
in a mouse model with established atherosclerosis. The lead candidate with longest duration of macrophage
CaMKIIγ silencing will be evaluated for efficacy in dampening atherosclerosis, with an emphasis on plaque
necrosis, fibrous cap thickness, and efferocytosis and other inflammation resolution endpoints. In Aim 2, we will
expand the long-acting siRNA therapy to dual-cell targeting for cardiometabolic disease, based upon the fact
that CaMKIIγ is a common upstream target in both hepatocytes in obesity-induced insulin resistance and lesional
macrophages in atherosclerosis. We will iteratively optimize the dual-targeting siCamk2g system in vitro and in
vivo, including in a new mouse model with combined insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, in a manner to
effectively improve type 2 diabetes and suppress atherosclerosis. We expect that successful completion of this
project will lead to fundamental understanding of how the new lipid-PEG chemistry controls siRNA delivery and
the development of a novel class of long-acting RNAi therapy for atherosclerosis and cardiometabolic disease."

 Sexual reproduction requires a germline, a lineage of cells formed in early embryos that ultimately
develops into eggs or sperm in the adult. Lore has it that when you lose your germline in development, you
become a sterile adult. In many animals, especially in the current favorites of lab animals, that is largely true.
 We use “rule breakers” though and find such lore unfounded. Our work focuses on the biology of primordial
germ cells, how they form during early development, and how they regenerate when the originals are removed.
Our work leverages embryos from a sister group to chordates – the sea star and sea urchin. While not
common organisms for biomedical research, these echinoderms have many strategic benefits for revealing
unique perspectives in the biology of germline formation and regeneration. Millions of synchronous embryos
from a single male/female cross allow biochemical and metabolic analysis of the germline, the resultant
embryos have ideal transparency for in vivo longitudinal imaging, they develop rapidly, are easy to manipulate
(single cell drop-mRNA-seq, optogenetics, cell and tissue transplantations) and they are well suited to
complementary gene perturbation approaches (CRISPR/Cas9, morpholinoantisense oligonucleotides, MASO),
and small molecule perturbations. The existing deep genomic and reagent resources for these animals,
coupled with their tractable experimental characteristics, yields a unique system for understanding primordial
germ cell biology with defined molecular and morphological endpoints, in live embryos with longitudinal
analysis, distinct metrics of quantitation, and transgenerational evaluations.
 We interrogate all levels of gene expression for this work, from chromatin modification to post-
transcriptional processing and post-translational networks, because that is what the embryos are “telling” us is
needed to understand these complex, and deeply rooted events in sexual reproduction. Our work emphasizes
longitudinal, in vivo analysis using high resolution optical imaging coupled with genomic perturbations, signal
pathway manipulations and manual transplantations and expirations to leverage contrasting mechanisms in
germ cell formation between closely related organisms. Sea urchins and sea stars have historically not been
genetically manipulated, and this reason is precisely how germ line regeneration has been discovered in this
and other animals seen to bear this trait. Relying on manual manipulations meant the genes needed for
regeneration were not disturbed, revealing their germ cell regenerative abilities. With new state-of-the-art
technologies, these animals can now be exploited with transgenerational analysis. Overall, our work
interrogates important biological questions from unique experimental perspectives using rule-breaking models
for innovation in the pursuit of new knowledge."

In this application, we examine the molecular mechanisms that instruct neural wiring and axon terminal
elaboration. We focus on the Drosophila neuromuscular system due to its invariant connectivity, limited
synaptic partners, and accessibility. Given that this ‘simple’ circuit has been studied for over four decades, it is
somewhat surprising that fundamental questions still exist as to how motor neurons choose their appropriate
muscle targets and how each motor neuron develops a unique, yet stereotyped, axon terminal structure that
underlies synaptic function. Conceptually, both of these developmental processes rely on specificity cues to
guide synaptic partner matching (role 1) and synaptic elaboration at each axon terminal (role 2). In support of
the first role, we previously discovered two interacting cell surface proteins (CSPs), DIP-α and Dpr10, that are
required for wiring a motor neuron to a subset of muscles. In support of the second role, these CSPs continue
to be expressed after connectivity, implying additional functions in synaptic development. Our central
hypothesis is that combinatorial Dpr-DIP interactions, in addition to specifying synaptic connections, also
participate in determining the structure and function of specified synapses. Insights into circuit development
arose in a prior collaboration where we characterized the ‘Dpr-ome’, the set of interactions between two
families of the immunoglobulin superfamily, the Dprs and DIPs. These 32 proteins bind to one another in
unique combinations, and our preliminary data reveal unique expression patterns in the Drosophila larval
neuromuscular circuit. Additionally, our data support a combinatorial Dpr-DIP interaction model that leverages
cis/trans interactions to instruct highly specific synaptic partnerships. We also reveal a novel signaling pathway
that underlies local synaptic elaboration. Given our findings and genetic reagents, we are in a unique position
not only to compare axon branch-specific identification tags but also to ask if synaptic elaboration of
neighboring axon terminals can be independently regulated. In the first aim, we capitalize on the Dpr-ome and
the expression of 6 DIPs in multi-innervating motor neurons to perform single-cell genetic manipulations and
examine how combinatorial Dpr-DIP codes instruct connectivity. In addition, we generate affinity variants to
reveal a coordinated cis/trans interaction model that enhances specificity. In the second aim, we utilize
functional and genetic approaches to understand how co-innervating inputs develop unique morphological and
functional properties. We identify a novel crosstalk signaling pathway between axon arbors that locally sculpts
NMJ size. Overall, these studies will uncover fundamental developmental programs required for neural circuit
wiring and axon terminal elaboration, with emphasis on how CSP codes modulate each of these processes."

Black people (BP) who use alcohol experience among the highest rate of alcohol-related consequences, yet only
a small percentage of BP with alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive treatment. This disparity in treatment unmet
need among BP highlights the necessity of efficacious alcohol treatments for this group. Among BP who receive
alcohol treatment, they tend report lower satisfaction with treatment and have higher dropout rates. Culturally
tailoring treatment has been proposed as one approach that might increase treatment satisfaction and retention
among BP. Given that extensive research links stress to alcohol craving and relapse, and Minority Stress Models
indicate that BP experiences stressors specific to being Black, incorporating race-related stress (RRS) is a
reasonable target for adapted alcohol treatments for this group. Although prior research shows RRS such as
discrimination predict alcohol misuse among BP, prior research has not investigated alcohol craving as a
potential mechanism that links RRS to alcohol misuse among BP. In addition, knowledge of cues associated
with drinking may be important for informing alcohol treatment adaptations for BP. Further, knowledge of
neutral/relaxing events could inform coping strategies to include in alcohol treatment for BP. The proposed
research will: [1) identify specifically which stressors and types of alcohol cues trigger alcohol craving and
strategies for coping among BP; 2) provide an in-depth understanding of the impact of race-related stress (RRS)
on alcohol craving; 3) identify other factors associated with the Black experience that contribute to AUD and
should be included in AUD treatment for this group; and 4) provide evidence of the feasibility and acceptability
of culturally-adapting an early CBT session based on these factors.] Completing this research will support my
development as an independent alcohol treatment researcher with a focus on priority populations (e.g., Black
people) and my career goals to [1) conduct meaningful research with hard to reach populations; 2) investigate
coping strategies and mechanisms that maintain AUD among BP, and 3) lead rigorous clinical trials research to
develop and test culturally-informed treatments for Black adults with AUD.] I will achieve my research and career
goals through training and mentorship by experts in: alcohol treatment research (Dr. Stephanie O’Malley),
personalized imagery procedures and stress and craving research (Dr. Rajita Sinha), RRS and treatment
adaptations for BP (Dr. Monnica Williams), treatment development and adaptations (Dr. Kathleen Carroll), and
community-based participatory and qualitative research methods (Dr. Larry Davidson), and collaboration with a
biostatistician with expertise in clinical trials research (Dr. Ralitza Gueorguieva). My research and training will be
completed at Yale School of Medicine, which has an abundance of physical and intellectual resources. Receiving
this training and completing this research will support my long-term career goal to eliminate treatment health
disparities among BP with AUD."

Ultradian oscillatory circuits are pervasive in biological systems. These dynamic oscillators range from pulsatile
p53 expression after g-radiation, to periodic nuclear to cytoplasmic shuttling of NFkB transcription factor in
response to cytokine, to cyclic expression of Hes/Her transcription factors in stem cells and presomitic
mesoderm (PSM). Ultradian genetic oscillators are associated with patterning and developmental transitions –
oscillations correlate with yeast metabolic cycles, foreshadow periodic lateral root branching in Arabidopsis,
regulate molt cycles in larval worms, associate with stem cell pluripotency, and synchronize transcriptional
response to starvation signals in Dictostelium. One biological oscillator is the vertebrate segmentation clock,
which controls somitogenesis, the process by which the PSM is sequentially divided into segments called
somites. At the core of the segmentation clock is an auto-inhibitory negative feedback loop involving Her/Hes
transcriptional repressors, which in turn regulates oscillatory expression of additional ‘cyclic genes’. Although
the cyclic genes in human and mouse belong to similar pathways (e.g., Notch, Wnt, FGF, Yap/Hippo), genes in
those pathways which are cyclically expressed vary among species, with the Her/Hes gene family genes being
common among vertebrates. We study the zebrafish segmentation clock, which oscillates with a 30-minute
periodicity and is 4-12 times faster than in mouse or human. In order for a rapid auto-inhibitory oscillator to
operate, there must be tight control over synthesis and decay of cyclic gene transcript and protein. A recent
experiment in which the Hes7 locus was swapped between human and mouse in vitro PSM systems showed
that expression delays and decay, controlled by factors in the host cell environment, are critical regulatory
parameters of the clock. To understand the mechanisms regulating these critical parameters, we are using the
zebrafish pnrc2 mutant in which transcriptional oscillations occur normally, but post-transcriptional decay
mechanisms are disrupted, to identify additional cyclic genes and dissect their regulation. The specific aims of
the proposal are to (1) identify Pnrc2-regulated zebrafish embryonic cyclic genes that play critical
developmental roles, (2) characterize the regulatory features and factors that control rapid decay dynamics of
cyclic gene transcripts, and (3) investigate the role of other post-transcriptional mechanism in regulating
segmentation clock function. We anticipate that our work will broadly impact understanding of post-
transcriptional mechanisms regulating oscillatory expression in many developmental contexts."
10838535,"Project Summary:
It has been estimated that more than 40% of older adults suffer vestibular (i.e. balance) deficits.
These losses cause numerous other problems associated with aging including cognitive decline
and injurious or fatal falls. There is also a strong link between age-related vestibular dysfunction
(ARVD) and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Despite the prevalence of these issues
and the massive toll they exert on public health and associated financial costs, the underlying
causes for ARVD are poorly understood. As a result, there are currently no FDA approved
therapies for ARVD. While a deep understanding of mechanistic causes is lacking, it has been
known for some time that a very common pathology that causes age related inner ear
dysfunction is the death of sensory cells called hair cells. Exactly why these cells die with age
remains a mystery. Here, we have identified a previously uncharacterized pattern in the
expression of the pro-survival gene, Pou4f3, where it is normally highly expressed in inner ear
hair cells, but is downregulated with age in a fashion that is correlated with hair cell death in the
balance organs of the inner ear. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that deleting Pou4f3
causes detrimental phenotypes in vestibular hair cells, exacerbates hair cell death, and leads to
significant declines in vestibular function. We propose to build on these preliminary data by
further examining Pou4f3 changes in expression in vestibular organs with age and in models of
Alzheimer's disease. We will also more thoroughly characterize the effects of Pou4f3 deletion to
better understand the effects that deletion or hypomorhpism have on balance and neurological
functions. We also propose to examine genomic regulatory elements in inner ear tissues from
young and aged mice to identify causal mechanisms for Pou4f3 downregulation with age as well
as possibly discover other key genes involved in aging processes in the inner ear. Finally, we
will test whether overexpression of Pou4f3 can prevent sensory cell death and age related
vestibular declines. Our preliminary data suggest that Pou4f3 is a promising therapeutic target
for preserving balance function in the aging human population. The experiments proposed will
determine the validity of that overarching hypothesis and will provide a foundation from which to
launch several new investigations into Pou4f3-targeted pharmacological and gene therapy
approaches for the prevention of age related vestibular decline."

Hispanics/Latinos (Latinos) are the 2nd largest and fastest growing ethnic group in the United States. Although
typically grouped as a single ethnic minority, Latinos are a heterogeneous population with diverse national
origins, unique genetic admixture patterns (African, European, and Indigenous American ancestry), and a wide
spectrum of socio-demographic characteristics. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common and fatal
cancer among all Latinos combined; however, mortality rates differ substantially within Latino subpopulations
defined, thus far, by place of birth. Rates are substantially higher in Puerto Ricans and Cubans, the subgroups
with the highest African ancestry, than in Mexicans and non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). After accounting for
socioeconomic status and access to care inequalities, differences in mortality persist, highlighting the need to
accurately characterize and critically assess biological contributors to intra- and inter-ethnic group disparities.
To overcome Latino underrepresentation in publicly available datasets, we propose to join resources from well-
annotated epidemiologic studies including the Hispanic Colorectal Cancer Study (HCCS, R01CA155101), the
Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB, U54CA163068), and the Moffitt Cancer Center Total Cancer Care (TCC) cohort
into a new consortium, the Latino Colorectal Cancer Consortium (LC3). This strategy allows us to maximize
sample size and adequately represent the most common Latino subgroups in the US (i.e. Mexican, with high
Indigenous American ancestry; Puerto Rican; and Cuban). We will characterize the somatic mutational profiles
of Latino CRCs by whole exome sequencing using previously-collected tissues from the HCCS, PRBB, and
TCC (n=600). For comparisons across racial/ethnic groups, we will leverage existing tumor sequencing data
from NHW and African American (AA) CRCs in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer
Consortium (GECCO; 7,000 NHW), The Cancer Genome Atlas (283 NHW and 61 AA), and TCC (589 NHW
and 40 AA). Here, we will examine driver mutation frequencies associated with estimated local and global
genetic ancestry in Latino CRC cases (Aim 1), conduct a trans-ethnic analysis comparing frequencies of
ancestry-associated and known clinically-actionable driver mutations in Latinos to NHW and AA (Aim 2), and
assess the implications of genetic ancestry for survival as well as differential efficacy of conventional and
potential targeted therapies for metastatic CRC using patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-based ex vivo live tissue
sensitivity assays (LTSA) (Aim 3). Ancestry-specific PDX models will be established using fresh tissue from 40
prospectively recruited Latino, AA, and NHW TCC participants. Our innovative LTSA approach permits timely
screening of multiple therapeutic agents while maintaining the tumor microenvironment and reliably predicting
clinical responses. Results from this study will help us better understand the biological underpinnings of
outcome disparities in Latino subgroups to inform translational efforts towards precision clinical applications."

Hispanics are diagnosed with melanoma at later stages than their non-Hispanic white (NHW) counterparts,
leading to increased likelihood of metastasis and worse survival. Hispanics are the largest ethnic group in the
United States and have rising rates of melanoma, and in particular, increases in tumors with the worst
prognosis. Hispanics represent an underserved and understudied population when it comes to melanoma
occurrence and outcome. In our recent analysis, while the risk of presenting with a late stage melanoma was
higher for Hispanics (OR:1.65 [95% CI:1.52-1.79]) than NHW, the overall risk of death from melanoma after
accounting for stage at diagnosis was similar for Hispanics and NHW (HR: 0.99 [95% CI: 0.94-1.04]), implying
that the overall poorer prognosis for Hispanics is due almost entirely to their later stage of disease at diagnosis,
rather than response to treatment or other factors (e.g. ability to access treatment) once they are diagnosed. A
later stage of diagnosis among Hispanics could be due to a multitude of factors all of which are modifiable: a
lack of access to appropriate screening, lack of adherence to screening recommendations, lack of
understanding of appropriate screening approaches in the primary care setting (among both patients and
physicians), or a combination of these factors. The key question remaining to be answered is WHY Hispanics
are diagnosed at a later stage: without answering that question, we cannot begin to design, test and implement
effective interventions to improve earlier detection and reduce melanoma-related disparities for Hispanics. We
will investigate modifiable factors related to diagnosis at later stage in Hispanics compared to NHW.
Aim 1: Determine the roles of patient-perceived risk and knowledge of melanoma, perceived barriers to
melanoma screening and diagnosis, patient access to screening and diagnosis, and cultural factors in
determining the later stage at diagnosis of melanoma in Hispanic compared to NHW melanoma patients.
Aim 2: Determine how, when and by whom melanomas are diagnosed (among Hispanics and NHW) and what
factors are related to time delays in the diagnosis of melanoma.
Aim 3: Develop, deliver and test a clinic-based health education telenovela intervention designed to achieve
earlier diagnosis of melanoma among Hispanics.
We will obtain data from multiple sources for this study in order to minimize the potential impact of selection,
response and survival biases all of which would compromise the scientific rigor of our Approach. We will
identify the key factors resulting in late diagnosis of melanoma among Hispanics to provide truly population-
based data on HOW to develop targeted patient-and-systems level interventions to reduce the melanoma
burden among Hispanics. We will then test targeted patient-and-physician level interventions carried out in low
income primary care setting ensuring that we intervene at the earliest possible stage."

Most caregiving responsibilities for persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) fall on their
family members. While we know types of tasks caregivers are responsible for, and have described styles of
caregiving, it remains unclear how processes used by caregivers impact outcomes for their care recipient. Missed
care is a term from health services which describes care that is left undone because of a decision made in light
of other factors. Our preliminary data suggest that missed care is a frequent and daily experience in ADRD family
caregiving. Therefore, using a concurrent mixed-methods triangulation design, we aim to more clearly
understand processes that contribute to missed care within ADRD family caregiving. The well-established
missed care model contextualizes the decision to skip care and points to situational antecedents (e.g., time
demands, resource scarcity) and internal processes (i.e., values) that impact nurses' decision-making on how to
prioritize care, including decisions to skip needed care. Our underlying hypothesis is that similar decision-
making processes can be identified within ADRD family caregiving. In Aim 1, we will enroll a sample of ADRD
family caregivers recruited from the local health system (N=225) to complete daily diary surveys characterizing
their day. Data will be analyzed using multi-level structural equation modeling to evaluate our application of the
Missed Nursing Care Model to family caregiving. In Aim 2, we will use a grounded theory design with in-depth
interview data collected from a subset of participants (N=35) to produce a theoretical description of decision-
making related to care provision and prioritization. In Aim 3, we will triangulate the data to create a data-driven
model to explain multi-factorial daily decision-making that leads to missed care in ADRD family caregiving.
Distinguishing the process of decision-making (Aim 2) from its underlying contextual factors (Aim 1) will identify
the underlying processes contributing to missed care. This body of data will inform a novel data-driven theoretical
model describing mechanisms leading to missed care events in ADRD family caregiving. This model will serve
as an intervention framework, highlighting actionable intervention targets. Our results have the potential to
significantly impact the family caregiving field by advancing its conceptual paradigm – moving from merely
defining the tasks for which family caregivers are responsible, to illuminating the decision-making process that
determines how they provide care in real-life contexts. This will permit a better alignment of future policies and
interventions with caregiver needs. An innovation of this work is its combination of micro-longitudinal data with
grounded theory analysis, which we surmise will lead to a more ecologically valid reflection of key processes in
day-to-day caregiving."

Dr. Colin Ellis is an Assistant Professor of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania with clinical expertise in
both epilepsy and genetics. His long-term goal as a physician-scientist is to translate genetic discoveries into
clinically meaningful tools that improve the care of people with epilepsy across the lifespan.
 Epilepsy is a highly heritable disorder and often runs in families. Recent progress identifying the genes that
cause epilepsy applies mostly to severe pediatric epilepsies with de novo (not inherited) mutations. Familial
epilepsy presumably also has a genetic basis, yet most families with epilepsy do not have an identifiable single
gene mutation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that familial epilepsy is caused by the aggregate effects of
many variants (risk alleles) distributed across the genome. Experiments will apply polygenic risk analysis to a
unique cohort of over 1,000 multiplex epilepsy families. The specific aims are (1) determine the genome-wide
contribution of polygenic risk to familial epilepsies, (2) identify novel and candidate biological pathways that
contribute to familial epilepsy, and (3) quantify the transmission of polygenic epilepsy risk within families using a
novel analytic method. The results of this project will contribute to understanding the genetic basis of familial
epilepsy, the biological pathways that are potential treatment targets, and the future development of clinical tools
that use patients’ genetic data to improve the diagnosis and management of epilepsy.
 The proposal builds on Dr. Ellis’s prior research on the heritability of phenotypic traits within familial
epilepsies, and extends that research into the analysis of genomic data. His training plan will develop his
expertise in genomic research methods, statistical genetics, and bioinformatics. He will also gain training and
skills in clinical trial design and implementation, positioning himself for the future clinical applications of this and
other genetic research in his dedicated neurogenetics clinics. Dr. Ellis’s team of mentors and advisors at the
University of Pennsylvania (Drs. Hakon Hakonarson, Laura Almasy, Kai Wang, and Brian Litt) provide specific
expertise in his areas of skill development and strong track records of mentorship. He will also leverage his
existing relationships with external advisors through the international Epi4K Consortium (Drs. Samuel Berkovic,
Michael Epstein, and Ruth Ottman) who are among the world leaders in his field of epilepsy genetics research.
Dr. Ellis’s clinical background in epilepsy and genetics, with the additional support of this career development
award and his unique mentorship opportunities, will position him to succeed as an independent physician-
scientist focused on using genetic discoveries to improve the lives of people with epilepsy."

Precise regulation of chromatin states is critical to many vital cellular processes, including differentiation and
proliferation. Chromatin misregulation has been associated with human diseases, such as cancer, intellectual
disabilities, and autoimmunity, among others. Understanding the mechanisms by which genomic access is
controlled at the level of chromatin is critical for revealing how cellular phenotypes are established and
maintained, and how these processes are altered in disease. This study focuses on elucidating the molecular
mechanisms by which the chromatin adaptor Menin coordinates protein complexes to transduce chromatin
signals into transcriptional outputs. This work will test the central hypothesis that context-specific functions of
Menin are dictated by its ability to bind distinct chromatin environments and recruit a variety of chromatin factors
in a highly regulated manner. During the mentored phase of the award, it will determine how Menin targets
specific genomic loci by integrating DNA-barcoded nucleosome libraries, epigenomics, and functional genomics
approaches. This multi-tiered approach will identify combinatorial histone modifications and transcription factors,
as well as delineate their biological relationships with Menin and how they contribute to its genomic localization
(Aim 1). It will also identify and comprehensively characterize chromatin proteins and complexes that mediate
regulatory functions of Menin at distinct cis-regulatory elements (Aim 2). During the independent phase of the
award, it will determine how recurrent MEN1 mutations affect Menin’s ability to target and shape the chromatin
landscape, as well as affect transcription (Aim 3). Furthermore, it will characterize the cellular and organismal
phenotypes elicited by endogenous expression of MEN1 mutant alleles. Successful completion of the proposed
studies will produce insights into how Menin regulates chromatin biology and transcription, and will provide a
greater understanding of the mechanisms by which disease-associated mutant Menin proteins promote disease.
Such knowledge could yield novel insights into the roles of chromatin and epigenetic regulators in normal
physiology and pathophysiology. The integrative approaches proposed here will serve as a valuable resource
for the wider scientific community interested in pursuing future studies of chromatin factors with presumed
adaptor/scaffolding functions that have not been studied previously due to limitations of current methods. They
will also serve as a platform for the PI to obtain new training in chromatin and chemical biology, biochemistry of
transcription, structural biology, and computational epigenomics. Such training will be critical for the development
of the PI’s career and will position her to effectively integrate these approaches for making novel and innovative
contributions to the field of chromatin biology."

Socioeconomically disadvantaged populations with multiple chronic conditions have high rates of
nonadherence to essential chronic disease medications after hospital discharge. Medication nonadherence
after hospital discharge is significantly associated with increased mortality and higher rates of readmissions
and costs among these patients. Major patient-reported barriers to essential medication use after hospital
discharge among low-income individuals are related to social determinants of health (SDOH) and include: 1)
financial barriers (i.e. inability to afford medications), 2) transportation barriers (i.e. inability to access
prescribed medications or needed follow-up care), and 3) system-level barriers (i.e. lack of availability of
discharge medications and care coordination services to ensure rapid primary care follow-up). Although,
medication therapy management and medication reconciliation services are important during care transitions,
these services have not proven effective in improving medication adherence after hospital discharge,
highlighting a critical need for innovative interventions. Our pilot study has demonstrated the feasibility and
potential to improve medication adherence among adult Medicaid and uninsured inpatients through full
medication subsidy and/or bedside and subsequent home delivery of medications during and after care
transitions. Moreover, our previous research found that support from certified pharmacy technicians trained as
coaches effectively increases rapid primary care follow-up after hospital discharge and could improve
medication adherence. Yet the effectiveness of interventions that directly address affordability, accessibility,
and availability to improve post-discharge medication adherence in vulnerable populations is still unknown.
The Medication Affordability, Accessibility, and Availability in Care Transitions (Med AAAction) Study
will test the effectiveness of a pharmacy-led care transitions intervention versus usual care through a
pragmatic randomized controlled trial of 388 Medicaid and uninsured hospital in-patients with MCC from three
large healthcare systems in Tennessee. The intervention will involve: 1) medications with zero copay, 2)
bedside delivery then home delivery of medications, and 3) care coordination provided by certified pharmacy
technicians/health coaches to assist with medication access and rapid primary care follow-up. We will examine
the impact of the intervention during 12 months on 1) medication adherence (primary outcome) and 2) rapid
primary care follow-up, 30-day readmissions, hospitalizations and emergency department visits, and costs. We
will conduct key informant interviews to understand patient experience with the acre received during and after
care transitions. By examining effectiveness of the intervention on outcomes including medication adherence,
health care utilization, costs, and patient experience, this study will provide valuable results to health systems,
payers, and policymakers to assist in future implementation and sustainability of the intervention for
socioeconomically disadvantaged populations."

 Foxp3+ regulatory CD4+ T cells (Treg) induce and maintain tolerance. Treg also limit the tempo
and strength of normal immune responses to environmental antigens and pathogens. How Treg are regulated
to manifest these functions is incompletely understood. Treg co-opt helper T cell (Th) transcription factors to
express similar selected receptors and migrate to Th resident sites to suppress immunity. Since Treg and Th
responses are not precisely aligned, these observations do not fully define mechanisms of how Treg are
regulated, nor identify how their function is channeled to be in the “right place at the right time”.
 The mechanisms of how Treg functions are geographically and kinetically distinct from conventional
CD4+ T cells (Tconv) remain elusive. We demonstrated that specific trafficking is required for Treg to suppress
allograft rejection: Treg sequentially migrate from blood through microvascular endothelium into tissue, and
then from tissue through afferent lymphatics to the draining lymph nodes (dLN). If this sequence is interrupted,
particularly lymphatic migration, Treg fail to be activated and suppress Tconv and dendritic cells (DC) in tissue
and LN. Indeed, Treg lose CD25 and Foxp3, becoming exTreg. Thus, a major requirement for normal Treg
function, and a step not required for Tconv, is afferent lymphatic migration. Our overall hypothesis is that the
Treg-lymphatic interaction is an important regulatory nidus for suppression and tolerance, and our goal is to
define the key events and structures that regulate this interaction.
 Our publications demonstrate novel attributes of Treg migration. Thymus derived (nTreg) and
peripherally induced Treg (iTreg) express high cell surface lymphotoxin  (LT). Treg use LT to migrate
across afferent lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC). Treg LT binds the LEC LT-receptor (LTR) to stimulate
non-canonical NFB-inducing kinase (NIK). NIK signaling facilitates Treg transendothelial migration (TEM) by
inducing LEC responses, including increased CCL21 expression, VCAM-1 rearrangement, and basal
lamellipodia that engage Treg. Our new studies show that the Treg-LEC interaction: 1.) uses LT-LTR to
condition LEC for permissiveness for gating the TEM of other leukocytes (i.e. T, B, DC, M); 2.) determines if
exTreg are induced; and 3.) relies on PD-1(Treg)/PD-L1(LEC) interactions for Treg TEM. Our data
demonstrate novel Treg-LEC interactions that serve essential roles for Treg suppression.
 Since Treg must migrate through tissues and interact with afferent lymphatics, and since Treg uniquely
deploy diverse interactions with LEC that regulate migration and suppression, these observations lead us to
the following specific hypotheses: 1.) Treg-LEC LT-LTR interactions regulate the permissiveness of LEC
for gating TEM of many other leukocyte subsets and acts as a gatekeeper for immunity, suppression, and
resolution of inflammation; 2.) Treg-LEC interactions determine if Treg maintain suppressive functions or
become exTreg; and 3.) Treg-LEC TEM relies on a novel role for PD-1/PD-L1."

programs. Simultaneous enrollment in more than one care management program (hereafter “simultaneous
enrollment”) may paradoxically lead to less coordinated care if the programs do not collaborate. The
prevalence and consequences of simultaneous enrollment in ADRD are unclear. This K23 proposal builds
upon the candidates' work funded by the Grants for Early Medical/Surgical Subspecialists' Transitioning to
Aging Research (GEMSSTAR, R03) to advance understanding of the consequences of simultaneous
enrollment and the acceptability and potential design of a primary care-based collaborative approach to care
management for older adults with ADRD. Aim 1 will result use a novel linked dataset that includes care
management enrollment data from two health systems in Baltimore and statewide hospital and emergency
department utilization data to determine whether simultaneous enrollment in care management is: (1) more
common among older adults with ADRD and (2) associated with preventable hospital and emergency
department use. Aim 2 will use qualitative interviews with four groups of stakeholders (care management
program leaders and staff, primary care clinicians and office staff, health information technology experts, older
adults with ADRD and their family caregivers) to identify barriers and facilitators to and the design of a primary
care-based collaborative approach to care management for older adults with ADRD. Aim 3 will pilot test a
primary care based collaborative approach to care management for older adults with ADRD focused on
feasibility and acceptability. The proposed research will contribute needed evidence about how to best
approach care for older adults with ADRD in the context of population health initiatives such as care
management. The candidate is a geriatrician who has already demonstrated a strong track record of academic
scholarship with numerous publications and early investigator grants. She has proposed a comprehensive set
of training activities that are geared toward her development as a clinician investigator and national leader who
informs improvements to care delivery for older adults with ADRD. The project will foster her continued career
development in the following ways (1) additional coursework and experience in advanced statistical methods,
(2) developing a foundational understanding of bioinformatics, (3) applied experience in intervention design in
the context of ADRD care, (4) improving her understanding of population health initiatives. She has assembled
an exemplary mentoring team with expertise in the subject area and the relevant research methods and works
in a rich research environment with tremendous resources to support her development."

G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulate neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release, and exert
profound effects on neural circuit functions. They play important roles in regulating motivation, reward, pain,
negative affect, and stress responses, which are all important in the context of substance use disorders
(SUDs). Exogenous ligands for several GPCRs have been shown to modify drug seeking behavior, which has
generated interest in GPCRs as targets for the development of pharmacological therapeutics for substance
use disorders. There are over 300 different non-sensory GPCRs expressed in mammalian brains, and
fundamental questions remain unanswered for all of them. For example, how does a given receptor's ability to
activate different G protein subtypes (Gi/o, Gs, Gq, G12/13) vary across neuroanatomical regions, cell types,
and subcellular regions? How are these properties altered in response to chronic drug use, chronic stress, or
chronic pain? To help answer these questions, we will develop new imaging methods in tissue sections for
neuroanatomical measurement of GPCR-mediated G protein activation, with subcellular resolution and G
protein subtype specificity. Our methods will only require common neuroscience equipment (cryostats and
fluorescence microscopes) and commercially available reagents. They will generate high-content information
on many GPCRs in healthy and diseased brains, and accelerate efforts to target GPCRs in addiction."

Despite potential lifelong consequences of gut microbiome dysbiosis, little is known about environmental
factors that influence its diversity and composition, including windows of susceptibility to exposure. The gut
microbiome performs essential functions for human health, and is related to neurobehavioral development via
the gut-brain axis. While a few studies have examined the infant/adult microbiome in the context environmental
epidemiology, the adolescent microbiome has not received attention, even though it occurs in a period of rapid
development when the hormonal milieu is changing, and internalizing behaviors often emerge. The proposed
project aims to address these gaps by examining the relations between exposure to triclosan—an antimicrobial
and endocrine disrupting compound—pubertal hormones, the adolescent microbiome, and neurobehavior.
This work will leverage the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment Study, a longitudinal birth
cohort with rich data collection including quantification of urinary triclosan at 10 visits from early gestation
through 12Y, pubertal hormones, the serum metabolome, and behavior. Crucial to this project, participants
provided stools at 12Y. During the K99 phase, fecal DNA will be sequenced to profile microbial communities,
which will be used to identify windows of susceptibility to triclosan (Aim 1). Dr. Laue will assess the role of
hormones in shaping the microbiome, including whether they mediate or modify the triclosan-microbiome
association (Aim 2), and examine the relationship between the adolescent microbiome and behavior (Aim 3a).
During the R00 phase, microbiome and behavioral assessment at 18Y to inform our understanding of the
longitudinal association between the microbiome and behavior (Aim 3b). Dr. Laue will characterize the role of
the serum metabolome in the microbiome-behavior association (Aim 4) and will determine whether bacterial
features mediate or modify the association between triclosan and adolescent behavior (Exploratory Aim 5).
To complete this research, Dr. Laue will complement her expertise in environmental epidemiology and the
infant microbiome with extensive training under the guidance of her mentorship team (Dr. Margaret Karagas—
primary mentor, Dr. Joseph Braun—co-mentor, Dr. Juliette Madan—advisor, Dr. Abby Fleisch—advisor, Dr.
Amy Willis—advisor). Dr. Laue will learn from coursework, workshops, and individualized trainings in 1)
processing microbiome data and microbiome measurement error, 2) multiple informant modeling and other
methods for identifying windows of susceptibility, 3) causal mediation, 4) pediatric endocrinology, and 5)
neurobehavior. This award will prepare Dr. Laue to be an independent researcher specializing in
environmental epidemiology and the adolescent microbiome. Dr. Laue’s research will fill a critical gap in the
environmental epidemiological literature, namely what role the adolescent microbiome and metabolome play in
the relationship between a ubiquitous environmental toxicant (triclosan) and neurobehavior."
10758279,"Project Abstract
 Descriptive research suggests that living alone with cognitive impairment (CI) is associated with many
complex challenges, such as a lack of available and accessible services to facilitate living independently, and
an elevated risk of hospitalization and institutionalization. Additionally, almost half of older adults who live alone
with CI experience difficulty with a basic or instrumental activity of daily living. However, there are few
interventions designed to assist older adults with CI who live alone to help them remain socially engaged in
their existing living environment. We propose to develop a novel home-based intervention, called Home Alone,
for persons living alone with CI (defined here as someone diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment/MCI or as
someone with cognitive impairment without dementia as established on a validated telephone-based
screener). Home Alone is a seven-module home-based program that is adapted from established, evidence-
based mental health and dementia care interventions (behavioral activation, Skills2Care®, and the Tailored
Activities Program). This proposed R21 will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and usefulness of Home
Alone to assist persons living alone with CI or AD/ADRD to successfully navigate the challenges of living
independently with dementia. The Specific Aims are: to 1) develop and adapt Home Alone for pilot testing
among 15 persons with CI who live alone over a 3-month period. A convergent parallel mixed methods design
will be utilized to determine whether various elements of Home Alone (e.g., delivery mode, length, and other
intervention characteristics) require adaptation; and 2) pilot-test a revised version of Home Alone over a 6-
month period among 50 participants living alone with CI. A sequential explanatory mixed methods design will
be utilized to do so. We will determine whether Home Alone is carried out as intended and is deemed feasible,
acceptable, and useful. The development of this theory- and evidence-informed intervention will directly
address the need for further understanding of how to support people living alone with CI. If successful, the
proposed R21 will position Home Alone for a subsequent randomized controlled evaluation and later as a
flexible, much-needed evidence-based resource that is scalable for healthcare systems and dementia support
programs."
10813856,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) into host cells is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein
(Env) trimer. The Env trimer consists of three gp120 exterior glycoproteins non-covalently associated with
three gp41 glycoproteins, which are anchored in the viral membrane and which possess long (~145-residue)
cytoplasmic tails. As the only virus-specific molecule on the viral surface, Env is the major target for host
neutralizing antibodies. Env conformational flexibility is essential for virus entry and also contributes to the
ability of HIV-1 to evade the host antibody response. During virus entry, the binding of gp120 to the receptors,
CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4, triggers conformational changes in the metastable Env that ultimately result in gp41-
mediated fusion of the viral and target cell membranes. The HIV-1 Env on virions potentially samples at least
three conformations: a “closed” pretriggered conformation (State 1), an “open” CD4-bound conformation (State
3), and an intermediate “partially open” conformation (State 2). Prior to receptor engagement, the State-1 Env
conformation is energetically favored, rendering primary HIV-1 strains relatively resistant to the binding of
potentially neutralizing antibodies. CD4 binding drives Env from State 1 to State 2 and then into State 3, the
prehairpin intermediate. Binding of the State-3 Env to the CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptor promotes the formation
of the highly stable gp41 six-helix bundle, resulting in the fusion of the viral and target cell membranes.
Multiple observations indicate that the State-1 Env conformation is metastable and easily disrupted by
alteration of Env sequences or extraction of Env from a membrane environment. Indeed, stabilized soluble
gp140 trimers or detergent-solubilized Env trimers for which detailed structures are available have been shown
to adopt a State-2-like conformation! The proposed work will address our currently incomplete understanding
of the State-1 Env conformation. How does HIV-1, despite its tremendous variability, maintain a State-1 Env
conformation? We have previously shown that changes in multiple Env amino acid residues can disrupt the
State-1 conformation. In the proposed studies, we will identify naturally polymorphic Env residues that, when
changed, stabilize the functional State-1 conformation. We will evaluate how State-1-stabilizing and State-1-
destabilizing changes in Env interact to determine viral phenotypes. One focus of these studies will be the
relationship between the conformation of the gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER) and the
conformation of the rest of the Env ectodomain.
The metastability of the State-1 Env conformation impedes its presentation to the host immune system during
natural HIV-1 infection and following vaccination. The proposed studies will inform efforts to produce purified
HIV-1 Env trimers stabilized in a State-1 conformation, which serves as the major target of broadly neutralizing
antibodies and potent small-molecule entry inhibitors. Understanding how the State-1 Env conformation is
regulated should expedite the design of Env-directed therapies and vaccines."
10933387,"ABSTRACT
Hepatitis B virus chronically infects 258 million people worldwide and causes 880 thousand deaths annually due
to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver failure. The current standard of care medications, including
pegylated interferon alpha that regulates host antiviral immune response and nucleos(t)ide analogues that inhibit
viral DNA polymerase, can potently suppress viral replication, but fail to induce the loss of HBV surface antigen
(HBsAg), an indication of successful immune control or the functional cure of chronic hepatitis B, in the vast
majority of the treated patients. Therefore, the development of novel antivirals with a new mechanism that can
activate the host antiviral immune response is required to achieve the functional cure of chronic hepatitis B
(CHB). A dihydroquinolizinone (DHQ) RG-7834, a small molecule discovered by Roche, can rapidly reduce
hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA levels, and hence almost all viral gene products, including HBsAg. This represents
an entirely new chemotype of HBV antivirals and a new approach for CHB control. However, the observation of
neurotoxicity in RG-7834 prohibits its systemic use for the management of CHB. We hypothesize that this side
effect can be minimized or eliminated by producing liver selective and CNS refractory DHQ antivirals. In support
of this hypothesis, we have recently designed and synthesized a novel series of bis-carboxylic acid based DHQ
derivatives that are shown, for the first time in this series, to have organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)
substrate properties, which facilitates selective distribution of the compounds to the therapeutic site of action
(liver), relative to the blood stream. This eﬀort led to the discovery of an early lead, called DHQ-65042, which is
potent in both biochemical and cellular assays (EC50 = 23 nM in HepG2.2.15 cell line), while demonstrating
considerable safety improvement potential in comparison to RG-7834, such as low blood-brain barrier (BBB)
penetration (in vitro assay) and high in vivo liver selectivity over plasma (liver/plasma ratio is 37.8 in a mouse PK
study). This novel series of liver targeting DHQs are promising for improving safety profiles through limited
distribution to the blood stream, the brain, and other body tissues, though the exposure of DHQ-65042 in the
liver from the oral route of a pharmacokinetic (PK) study is moderate. In this R21 proposal, to validate the
feasibility of developing novel liver targeting DHQ derivatives as hepatitis B virus surface antigen reducers with
practical value, we will perform lead optimization to improve the liver exposure to an efficacious level with low
exposure in plasma maintained, and identify a balance window between hepatoselectivity and GI/ liver
absorption of new leads through the works proposed in three aims. Successful completion of this project will
allow us to develop a new generation of DHQs that are selectively delivered to livers with concentrations sufficient
enough to significantly reduce HBsAg and have better safety profiles, and to provide a new lead ready for in vivo
toxicity and efficacy studies."
10906740,"Bats are perhaps the most fascinating but least understood mammalian order. It is clear
that, although bats are a critically needed new model organism, limited access to animal
and cell models has hindered their study. We recently generated the first induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a bat (R. ferrumequinum) and discovered that bat
iPSCs had a unique transcriptomic profile enriched in metabolomic and immune
pathways ketogenic metabolism and a unique inflammasome response. We plan to
generate additional to test if our novel protocol can be used for any bat species and that
essential metabolic genes uniquely expressed only in bat cells, including HMGC2, can
be knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9. We will also evaluate if the inflammatory response
is altered in myeloid cells derived from bat iPSCs. Bat stem cell lines and differentiated
progeny will help address bat physiology’s most tantalizing questions, including
immunity."
10820422,"Abstract: RAS proteins (KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS) are the most extensively studied set of mutationally activated
oncogenes. Yet we do not completely understand the structural impact of RAS mutations in cancer. As of August
2020, there are 333 experimentally solved wild-type (WT) and mutated RAS structures in the Protein Data Bank
(PDB), comprising 175 HRAS, 155 KRAS, and 3 NRAS structures. This growing structural ensemble provides a
valuable resource to discover novel insights into RAS activity through statistical analyses that enable quantitative
determination of biological correlates. In recent years, NMR studies and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations
(using experimental structures as templates) have shown that the conserved RAS switch 1 (SW1) and 2 (SW2)
regions display dynamic conformational behaviors that modify RAS activity. Conformational changes in
SW1/SW2 facilitate the concerted binding of regulator and effector proteins at these regional interfaces, in turn
promoting proper switching of RAS proteins from an active GTP-conformer to an inactive GDP-conformer. In
addition, biochemical studies have provided evidence for the existence of a GTP-bound RAS homodimer
required for activation of certain signaling pathways. While we know that RAS homodimerization occurs in a
GTP-bound state, we do not know if a specific RAS conformational arrangement is required for RAS homodimer
formation and associated protein-protein interaction (PPI) events. Further complicating this issue, there is no
consolidated understanding of how mutations on RAS proteins may shift SW1/SW2 conformation in ways
favoring or disfavoring RAS PPIs, including RAS homodimerization. The objective of this proposal is to create a
unified RAS structural classification to assess the impact of oncogenic mutations on KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS,
ligands (GTP, GDP, inhibitors, or none), and PPIs/homodimerization. In preliminary work, I created a unified
RAS structural nomenclature based on clustering SW1/SW2 conformations across experimental structures of
KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS. I have also performed a pan-cancer analysis of 18,841 RAS missense mutations from
a cohort of 100,707 patients, providing the most comprehensive existing resource for KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS
mutational patterns in human tumors. In Aim 1, I will compare the conformational and PPI preferences of RAS
mutated and WT forms with experimentally solved structures. Following this, in Aim 2, I will predict the
conformational and PPI preferences of RAS mutated and WT forms by examining energy distributions of
generated structural ensembles. If we can reproduce the effects of some known mutations, then we can
confidently predict the consequence for novel mutations that have not been experimentally studied. In completing
this proposal, I will present the unified RAS structural nomenclature, including the determined impact of RAS
mutations, in a database that will be continually updated upon solving of new experimental structures. This work
will serve as a biological resource, informing future studies stratifying RAS WT and mutated structures and efforts
to create drugs directly targeting RAS proteins for cancer treatment."
10789997,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by persons
with dementia (PWD), affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Agitation brings much stress and
detriment to patients and caregivers. Treatment of agitation is often pharmacological intervention which can
have adverse side effects. There is a great need for identification of early behavioral warning signs and
environmental precipitants of agitation so that it can pave the way for proactive management of agitation and
lower the burden on caregivers. The overall goal of this project is to address this critical unmet need through
the proposed research and mentored training of the applicant. The Oregon Center for Aging & Technology
(ORCATECH), under the direction of Dr. Kaye (proposed primary mentor), has more than a decade of
experience developing and deploying a digital behavioral assessment platform in older adults' homes and has
the experience analyzing the data collected in the clinical context of older adults. The scientific goals of this
proposal are to develop digital behavioral markers that identify episodes of agitation, identify early behavioral
warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation, and build a risk prediction model of episodes of
agitation using environmental and behavioral sensors and techniques from machine learning and time series
analysis. The applicant will collect behavioral data from 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living in
memory care units and 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living at their own homes using passive
infrared motion sensors, wearable actigraphy devices, and bed pressure mats and follow them for 2 years.
Such behavioral data will be used to identify digital behavioral markers that indicate or predict episodes of
agitation. The applicant will also collect environmental data (ambient light level, noise level, temperature,
relative humidity, and barometric pressure) from their living environments, and such data will be used to
identify environmental precipitants of agitation. In order to conduct the proposed study and prepare for an
independent research career, the applicant will be trained through taking courses and attending workshops in
the following areas: (1) the different diagnosis and standard of care for PWD, their neuropsychiatric symptoms
and their precipitants; (2) methods of using technology in dementia research; (3) novel methods from deep
learning and time series analysis for building risk prediction models of agitation; and (4) development of
professional skills for conducting successful and ethically responsible clinical research. The proposed team of
mentors and consultant each provide expertise in one or more of these areas and are together committed to
collaboratively facilitating the applicant's training. The applicant will apply these new skills to the proposed
research project and obtain R01 support in order to use the methods for detecting and predicting episode of
agitation to create and explore the effectiveness of early interventions for agitation in PWD. Such findings are
likely to lead to improve methods for reducing and detecting episodes of agitation and ultimately help protect
caregivers' physical and mental health while improving dementia care."
10798309,"Sustained intra-articular delivery of disease modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) holds promise for preventing
the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). However, since (DMOADs) are intended for early OA, when patients are
active, repeated mechanical loading of joints can be detrimental to the delivery system, causing rapid drug
release. To our knowledge, none of the previously reported intra-articular platforms for DMOAD delivery have
been evaluated in physically active animals or have considered the impact of activity induced mechanical
stress on the delivery platform and the drug release. We have developed a hydrogel platform that can rapidly
recover following mechanical stress relevant to running human knee joints, with no impact on sustained
release of the encapsulated agents. Hydrogel loaded with cathepsin-K inhibitor (L-006235) – a small molecule
DMOAD prevented OA progression in mice undergoing treadmill running. The overall objective of this
application are to (i) develop variants of our hydrogel platform with different release kinetics of L-006235 to
understand how local release kinetics/pharmacokinetics impacts therapeutic efficacy and (ii) further engineer
the hydrogel platform for delivery of biologic DMOADs. Our long-term goal is to develop a versatile and
mechanically stable drug delivery platform with tunable release kinetics for intra-articular delivery of DMOADs
in active joints to prevent OA progression. Our central hypothesis is that a mechanically stable hydrogel
platform can minimize the impact of joint-related mechanical stress on sustained release of DMOADs and
therapeutic efficacy of this system can be maximized by tuning the local release kinetics of DMOADs. To
achieve our objectives, we propose two specific aims: 1) Investigate the impact of release kinetics of L-006235
on therapeutic efficacy; and 2) Investigate the delivery of biologic DMOADs in active joints using hydrogel.
Under the first aim, we will develop hydrogel variants with different release kinetics of L-006235 and will study
the impact of mechanical stress relevant to human joints on hydrogel variants and L-006235 release. Next, we
will validate the differences in release kinetics in treadmill running mice and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy
and off-target effects in treadmill running mice with OA. For the second aim, we will identify formulation
parameters, including TG-18 concentration and choice of solvent to maximize loading and stability of three
different biologic DMOADs (IL-1Ra, FGF-18 and sTNFRII). Formulations will be evaluated for mechanical
stability in vitro, release kinetics in treadmill running mice and efficacy and off-target effects in treadmill running
mice with OA. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it focuses on a
novel hydrogel platform that is mechanically stable in joints, allows tunability of release kinetics and is
versatile. We will be the first to (i) demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of a wide range of DMOADs in “physically
active joints” and (ii) demonstrate that release kinetics of DMOADs defines their therapeutic efficacy. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific justification for continued
development and future clinical trials of this promising hydrogel that will enable us and others to compare the
effect of different DMOADs on OA pathology in active joints, and identify the most promising DMOADs and
their ideal release kinetics. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to offer paradigm shifting impact in OA
therapy by enabling translation of promising DMOADs."
10755335,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has resulted in dramatic, durable responses, especially for
patients with B cell malignancies that are refractory to standard treatment. Numerous clinical trials are focused
on improvements of the approach and applications for a much broader range of hematologic malignancies and
solid tumors. However, this targeted therapy is also associated with high relapse rates and the development of
severe toxicities that are challenging to predict. Thus, improved tools to optimize and monitor response are
critically needed. Our ultimate goal is to develop a simple, quantitative, and non-invasive point-of-care device to
monitor CAR-T cell interactions in vivo dynamically with the needed frequency. The objective of this proposal is
to demonstrate proof-of-principle of the approach and its translational potential for human studies. Our approach
relies on in vivo flow cytometry (IVFC) assessments using endogenous and exogenous sources of optical
contrast and its optimization and use to detect CAR-T/B cell interactions in vitro and in vivo. The proposed
method relies on the confocal detection of endogenous light scattering and fluorescence (label-free or LF) signals
of flowing CAR-T/B cells that are interacting. Previous studies support the hypothesis that interacting CAR-T/B
cells will likely yield unique optical signatures. We anticipate that utilization of advanced signal processing
approaches will enable us to optimize detection of these signals in the challenging milieu of flowing blood in vitro
and in vivo. Initial measurements with fluorescent protein (FP)-expressing human CAR-T and B cells spiked in
whole blood will allow us to develop, implement, and assess enhancements in hardware and software to realize
accurate LF-IVFC assessments of interacting CAR-T and B cells. (Aim 1.1). The translational potential will be
tested on blood samples isolated from patients undergoing CAR-T cell therapy at different time points over the
first month of therapy. We expect to detect variations in the numbers of interacting CAR-T and B cells using LF-
IVFC and this expectation will be corroborated with antibody-based flow cytometry measurements (Aim 1.2).
Finally, we will perform in vivo LF and FP-based IVFC measurements using mice infused with human B
lymphoblasts and CAR-T cells at concentrations known to induce variations in the relative circulating levels of
these cells. Our goal will be to demonstrate that LF-IVFC measurements can be performed with high enough
accuracy to detect dynamic changes in the numbers of interacting CAR-T and B cells over a month. We expect
to generate a robust set of data that will motivate development and application of LF-IVFC monitoring of
interacting CAR-T/B cells for dynamic, non-invasive monitoring of patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy. Such a
device may enable acquisition of information regarding individual patient responses with a combined time
resolution and sensitivity/specificity that is not possible to achieve currently. We anticipate such data will yield a
novel paradigm for patient monitoring to optimize response and identify patients that may need more timely
interventions to optimize outcomes."
10929941,"We have studied the role of cold storage and post-transfusion hemolysis as one of the pathways that define the
red blood cell (RBC) storage lesion, and how inherited genetic polymorphisms have a great effect on RBC
function and transfusion outcomes. These studies have catalyzed new fields of research, encompassing the
biophysics that govern hemolysis-related impairments in NO/ROS equilibrium, studies of the transfusion-
recipient physiological and pathological responses, and interactions with donor genetics on RBC transfusion
outcomes. In this renewal we have focused on a simple observation, that the variability in donor RBC stability
and function during cold storage and post-transfusion recovery is more dependent on the donor, than on the
actual time the unit is in storage. For example, common mutations like sickle cell trait (HbAS), G6PD deficiency,
and SNPs in SEC14L4 and MYO9B exhibit enhanced storage hemolysis and lower post-transfusion recovery.
These observations inform our overarching hypothesis that evolved variability in genes encoding RBC proteins
significantly modulates RBC function and recovery after transfusion. Few studies have explored how these
common or rare, single or polygenic, variants modulate donor RBC function during storage and post-transfusion.
To address this question, in collaboration with the REDS-III program, we performed the largest genome-wide
association study (GWAS) to date of >12,000 healthy human blood donors (Page et al. JCI 2021). We identified
27 candidate SNPs at genome-wide significance (P<10-8) that were associated with enhanced or reduced
responses to hemolytic perturbations. The identified variants were in candidate genes known to modulate
erythrocyte structure, metabolism, and ion channels; in genes encoding antioxidant enzymes; and in proteins
with unknown function (SEC14L4 and MYO9B). Many SNPs were observed in polygenic combinations
associated with higher risk of hemolysis. We also confirmed that many of the identified SNPs were associated
with higher rates of steady state hemolysis in patients with sickle cell disease and were associated with lower
post-transfusion RBC recovery in large patient populations (Roubinian et al, JCI Insight 2022). Finally, we have
developed and established colonies of novel CRISPR-Cas9 genetically engineered “humanized” mouse models
carrying the human SNPs for the common A- African American G6PD deficiency variant (Zuchelkowski et al,
PLoS One, 2020) and a SNP with unknown function in SEC14L4. In this renewal we propose to now explore the
function of these candidate SNPs in vitro and in vivo, using our novel “humanized” SNP mouse models and our
validated and FDA-approved high sensitivity autologous red cell biotin labeled transfusion-recovery protocols in
humans. We anticipate that these studies will identify new signaling pathways that modulate RBC function, and
inform a Precision Transfusion Medicine field, in which RBC donor genotype determines the time limits of blood
storage and recovery."
10812329,"Summary
 This is a resubmission of the R01 grant proposal entitled “Roles of Non-REM and REM sleep in facilitating
visual perceptual learning”. Visual perceptual learning (VPL) refers to long-term performance enhancement on
a visual task as a result of visual experience. VPL not only provides substantial insight into visual and brain
plasticity but can also help in the development of an effective clinical tool to improve vision that is damaged or
declining due to disease or other causes. Thus, it is crucial to examine what factors facilitate VPL. Although a
number of studies have developed effective methods to facilitate VPL during training, much less is known about
the role that sleep plays in facilitating VPL (sleep facilitation). A better understanding of the roles and
mechanisms of sleep facilitation may be of enormous potential in improving visual training methods.
 Our pilot study identified 3 types of facilitatory effects of sleep in VPL: offline performance gains, stabilization,
and post-sleep learning promotion. Aim 1 will investigate the underlying mechanism of these 3 sleep facilitation
effects by testing: H(ypothesis)1-1: The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and early visual areas (EVAs)
play a role in inducing offline performance gains during NREM sleep, H1-2: The ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and
EVAs play a role in inducing stabilization during REM sleep, and H1-3: The vmPFC and EVAs play a role in
inducing postsleep learning promotion during REM sleep. This will be done by measuring the E/I ratio changes
in the retinotopically-defined EVAs, dlPFC, and vmPFC during NREM and REM sleep monitored by
polysomnography (PSG) and the correlation between the E/I ratio changes and each sleep facilitation effect. If
the results support these hypotheses, we will test whether the dlPFC and/or vmPFC plays a similar or different
role from EVAs in inducing sleep facilitation. To do so, we will compare the E/I ratio changes and the correlation
between each sleep facilitation effect and the E/I ratio changes in the dlPFC or vmPFC with those in EVAs.
 Our other pilot study indicates that reward provided during training and posttraining sleep interact with each
other to enhance offline performance gains. This suggests that reward process is fundamentally involved in sleep
facilitation. Aim 2 will examine whether and how reward interacts with sleep to enhance sleep facilitation effects.
First, we will examine the other two sleep facilitation effects by testing H2-1: Reward and sleep interact with each
other and enhance stabilization, and H2-2: Reward and sleep interact with each other and enhance postsleep
learning promotion. Next, we will examine the mechanism underlying the interaction effect by testing H2-3: Sleep
facilitation effects, which may involve the dlPFC, vmPFC and EVAs during NREM and REM sleep, interact with
and are enhanced by reward. To test H2-1 to H-2-3, we will measure psychophysical performance for each sleep
facilitation effect as well as the E/I ratio changes in EVAs, vmPFC and dlPFC during NREM and REM sleep
monitored by PSG."
10908999,"This U01 application SHIELD (Stopping Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) In Elderly Lupus Disease) follows
completion of an R34 and is driven by the exigency to establish evidence-based protocols for the management
of aging lupus patients, a topic that has received minimal attention. Data are needed to accurately weigh the
balance between accumulating ocular exposure of HCQ versus the risk of disease flare in a population that may
have more inactive disease than younger patients. Despite a track record of safety with regard to infection
compared to traditional immunosuppressive agents, the risk of HCQ retinal toxicity escalates with continued use.
Evaluation using sensitive standard of care approaches suggests nearly a third of patients accrue retinal
damage. The decision to discontinue HCQ is difficult; however clinical equipoise should guide this consideration
especially in patients who have been stable and on the medication for years. As the longevity of lupus patients
improves, which may increase comorbidities that affect HCQ clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency), the ratio of
efficacy to toxicity is expected to decrease. That disease activity may wane in the aging population drives the
ratio down even further. The purpose of this U01 is to conduct a Phase III, randomized, double-blind placebo
controlled, multi-center, non-inferiority clinical trial to address the safety of withdrawal of HCQ in SLE patients
≥60 years old. The central hypothesis is that HCQ can be safely discontinued in stable/quiescent patients
assessed by validated disease activity and flare instruments in the context of serologic, cytokine and
transcriptomic profiling. The population under study will be 330 patients who fulfill at least one of the classification
criteria (ACR, SLICC, EULAR/SLICC) for SLE, are ≥60yrs, are currently taking at least 200 mg HCQ daily for at
least 7yrs and have stable disease. Patients will be randomized to either the placebo or active arm and followed
every 2 months for one year to assess disease activity and flares. Subjects will be recruited from NYU (Peter
Izmirly, Jill Buyon), Albert Einstein (Anna Broder), HSS (Jane Salmon), Columbia (Anca Askanase), OMRF (Joan
Merrill), Penn State (Nancy Olsen), and UCLA (Maureen McMahon). The primary outcome will be the occurrence
of a moderate/severe flare during follow-up. Sample size is based on the projection of a 13% moderate/severe
flare rate in patients remaining on HCQ and a non-inferiority margin equal to a 10% absolute difference in rates
between groups. The trial infrastructure has been established in compliance with NIH guidelines and completion
of the following deliverables from the awarded R34: model recruitment supported by an sIRB with all sites; study
protocol with inclusion of biomarker studies and comprehensive statistical analysis plan; manual of operating
procedures; electronic data capture system; data management plan; acquisition of study drugs; and training of
support staff. It is anticipated that this trial will significantly impact the care of our aging lupus population and
provide a molecular landscape of autoimmune parameters that may identify patients appropriate for medication
adjustments."
10757934,"Project Summary:
For women in the United States, breast cancer is not only the most common malignancy but also the second
leading cause of death. In this application, we focus on a specific subtype of breast cancer known as triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC). Because TNBC has a higher recurrence rate and poorer overall mortality than
other subtypes of breast cancer, it is more aggressive and extremely difficult to treat with standard therapies.
Epidemiological studies have clearly shown that African American (AA) women are more likely to develop
advanced TNBC than Caucasian American (CA) women. For instance, in Louisiana (LA), where we live, from
2010 to 2017, there were 3,790 TNBC cases, of which 1,861 (49.1%) were from the AA population versus 1,900
(50.1%) were from the CA population, while 32.8% of the LA population were AA and 62.8% were CA. Notably,
43.5% of the AA patients were diagnosed with regional or distant metastasis, compared with 36.6% of CA
patients. Thus, TNBC represents a significant challenge to racial health disparities in Louisiana. The overall goal
of this project is to determine the extent to which modifiable factors in the neighborhood physical and social
environment affect the prognosis of TNBC patients and whether their effects can be accurately reflected and
quantified through detectable biological variables. Recent studies have revealed that tumor-derived exosomes
(TDEs) play a prominent role in promoting tumor progression and metastasis. TDEs contain many oncogenic
elements, including multiple miRNAs, mRNAs, proteins, and lipids. Notably, exosomal miRNAs (ES-miRs) have
been reported to be critical for crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment
(TME) and the establishment of pre-metastatic niches. Therefore, we hypothesize that ES-miRs are biological
variables that not only reflect and quantify the effects of environmental risk factors associated with racial
health disparities, but are also functionally involved in the progression of TNBC. Our specific aims are as
follows: Aim 1: Use multilevel mediation and moderation analysis to identify significant ES-miRs and
environmental risk factors for TNBC progression and understand how their interactions explain racial health
disparities in TNBC. Aim 2: Validate the function of selected ES-miRs in TNBC progression using in vitro and in
vivo models. Aim 3: Develop a new model to predict TNBC progression in AA and CA patients. We expect that
our study can develop an innovative approach to quantify adverse physical and social environmental influences
on the progression of TNBC across different races and provide insights into the development of more effective
strategies to reduce racial health disparities in TNBC."
10796825,"1 ABSTRACT. Urinary tract infections (UTI) are extremely common world-wide, and can lead to serious
 2 complications, including renal scarring and urosepsis. Standard-of-care treatments rely on antibiotics: empiric
 3 treatment for uncomplicated UTI (uUTI), broad-spectrum for complicated UTI (cUTI), and long-term prophylaxis
 4 for recurrent UTI (rUTI). This constant antibiotic exposure not only disrupts the gut microbiome but drives
 5 antimicrobial resistance among uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), the
 6 predominant causative agents of UTI. The global spread of multidrug-resistant uropathogens, such as those
 7 caused by extended spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
 8 (CRE), has been designated by the CDC as “serious” and “urgent” public health threats, respectively. Therefore,
 9 new strategies to combat multidrug resistance are desperately needed. One such approach is to target and
10 inhibit the function a key virulence factor of UPEC and Kp, the FimH adhesin. FimH is a surface-exposed,
11 mannose-binding protein that facilitates bacterial binding to the host urinary bladder epithelium, and its function
12 is essential for the establishment and persistence of a UTI. Using this anti-adhesive strategy, a small molecule
13 mannoside FimH antagonist was developed by Fimbrion and GlaxoSmithKline and is currently in Phase 1b
14 clinical trials for the treatment of uUTI. As a follow-up to this collaboration, we began exploring the next
15 generation of FimH antagonists that target the more difficult-to-treat cUTI, by additionally recruiting antibodies
16 from the host immune system. Known as FimH antagonist antibody recruiting molecules (FimH-ARMs), these
17 mannoside-based therapeutics have nanomolar affinity for the FimH target and our early protype FimH-ARM has
18 shown enhanced ability to reduce the severity of acute bladder infection in a mouse model of uUTI. We
19 hypothesize that in addition to antagonism of FimH function, FimH-ARMs will provide additional mechanisms of
20 action (MoAs) through engagement of the immune system and extended pharmacokinetics (PK), resulting in
21 superior efficacy over conventional mannosides in cUTI. The main goals of this proposal are: (1) to generate a
22 highly potent lead series of FimH-ARMs that will recruit naturally occurring human antibodies to uropathogenic
23 bacteria and (2) demonstrate in vivo efficacy in a model of cUTI. To accomplish these goals, we will (i) expand
24 the FimH-ARM library to identify potent lead compounds with optimized mouse PK profiles, and (ii) test the in
25 vivo efficacy of lead FimH-ARMs in a mouse cUTI model and (iii) Select our advanced lead FimH-ARM and
26 establish the spectrum of activity, MoA, and PK benchmarks for late lead optimization in Phase II. Success will
27 be defined as: identification of an advanced lead FimH-ARM, that shows in vivo efficacy superior to its parent
28 small molecule FimH antagonist and non-inferiority to a standard-of-care antibiotic and demonstrates additional
29 immune system MoAs beyond FimH antagonism. These studies will facilitate the early preclinical development
30 of a novel, antibiotic-sparing therapeutic, for preventing cUTI caused by FimH-expressing uropathogens."

Specifically, the Administrative Core will manage and coordinate the projects and cores of the Tri-I TBRU,
including resource and fiscal management, management of contractual agreements, and problem identification

communications to external partners."
10830987,"Abstract: The goal of the Clinical Core is to recruit and characterize patient cohorts in Haiti, and to collect and
ship clinical samples for studies of tuberculosis (TB) persistence in Projects 1- 3. Core activities will be performed
by the Groupe Haitien d'Etude du Sarcome de Kaposi et des Infections Opportunistes (GHESKIO) in Port au
Prince, Haiti. GHESKIO is a Haitian non-profit organization which was founded in 1982 and is dedicated to
research, service, and training in HIV and tuberculosis. It has conducted NIH supported clinical research for 38
years and has all the essential core components for the conduct of the proposed TBRU studies, including:
experienced research staff, out-patient clinics, access to large TB patient populations, a BSL-3 TB laboratory, a
data management center, and an institutional review board. In 2019, GHESKIO diagnosed and treated 1,456
patients with culture confirmed TB including 225 re-treatment patients with a second episode of TB, 15 families
with multiple siblings with TB, and 321 HIV-negative patients with pulmonary cavity disease and high sputum
bacillary load who are at high risk of recurrence after completion of TB treatment. A major focus of this Tri-I
TBRU is on post-treatment persistent infection (PTPI) and TB recurrence. Given that more than 1 million of the
world’s 10 million cases of TB diagnosed in 2018 were recurrent TB cases, understanding genetic, immunologic
and pharmacokinetic correlates for TB persistence and recurrence is critical.
The Specific Objectives of the Tri-I TBRU Clinical Core are:
1) Conduct a cross-sectional study of 250 HIV-negative patients with recurrent TB, 250 HIV-negative
 controls with a single episode of TB, and 50 families with active TB in multiple siblings. Controls with
 a single episode of TB and post-treatment follow-up will be matched to recurrent cases by age, sex, and time
 since completion of first TB regimen. There will be a single study visit. Clinical samples including whole
 blood for host DNA and RNA, serum, PBMCs, urine, and stool will be shipped to New York.
2) Conduct a longitudinal cohort study of 500 HIV-negative drug-sensitive TB patients with pulmonary
 cavities on chest radiograph, high sputum bacillary load and high risk for recurrent TB. Participants
 will be enrolled at initiation of anti-tuberculosis therapy (2HRZE/4HR) and followed for 24 months after
 completion of therapy (30 months total). We estimate that 40 - 50 participants will develop recurrent TB (4-
 5 recurrences/100 patient years). M. tuberculosis isolates will be genotyped to determine if recurrence is
 from relapse of prior infection (estimated 85% of cases) or reinfection with new strain (15%). We will quantify
 M. tuberculosis in sputum at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 24 weeks during therapy using BACTEC time-to-
 positivity. We will collect samples including blood, PBMCs, urine, and stool at enrollment, week 2, 4, 8, at the
 completion of therapy and 3 and 6 months after therapy for analyses by TBRU Projects 1- 3 and PIP Core."
10830991,"Pharmacology and Immunopathology Core – Hackensack Meridian Health
ABSTRACT
The pharmacology and ImmunoPathology Shared Resource Core will serve the Projects and the Clinical Core
of this TBRU Consortium to deliver (1) standardized high-dimensional immunophenotyping of mouse and human
samples, including data analysis and dimensional reduction, and (2) drug quantitation in plasma and sputum to
identify immunologic and pharmacokinetic determinants of post-treatment persistent infection and relapse.
High dimensional immunophenotyping: a significant subset of apparently cured TB patients present with non-
resolving and intensifying lesions on PET–CT images along with the presence of Mtb mRNA in sputum and
bronchoalveolar lavage samples, up to 1 year after a standard 6-month treatment. This suggests that even
apparently curative TB treatment may not eradicate all Mtb bacteria in most patients and reveals an important
role for the immune response in maintaining a disease-free state. The Clinical Core will recruit a cohort of 500
subjects with active TB and at high risk of relapse due to cavitary disease and high bacterial burden in sputum.
To mimic the phenomenon of post-treatment persistent infection in humans and identify determinants of relapse,
Project 3 (Ehrt et al.) has developed and optimized a mouse model of paucibacillary TB. We will apply high-
dimensional immune-phenotyping with samples collected from the cohort of 500 subjects recruited by
the Clinical Core, and the mouse model of PTPI, to identify immunologic determinants of relapse. Five
wild-derived mouse strains with diverse genetic backgrounds and a broad spectrum of responses to TB infection
will be studied in the model of PTPI to study the impact of host genetics on disease progression and outcome in
mice, and identify mouse strains that develop immune responses closer to humans (Project 3). We will also
apply deep immunophenotyping to samples from subjects with inborn errors of immunity (Project 2) to confirm
the impact of candidate mutations and associated deficiencies on the immune response.
Pharmacokinetic determinants of relapse: Leveraging the cohort of 500 TB patients at high risk of relapse, we
will measure drug concentrations in plasma, sputum and saliva, during chemotherapy with the first line agents:
rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. Together with pharmacogenetic profiling (Project 2), the
results will be analyzed using population PK approaches to determine whether inter-individual pharmacokinetic
variability contributes to clinical relapse and microbiome dysbiosis (Project 1).
We have access to large BioSafety Level 3 facilities where TB infected rodents are routinely housed for extended
periods, with an integrated platform for high-dimensional immunophenotyping allowing the simultaneous profiling
of up to 28 immune markers in mouse or human cells processed in a BSL-3 facility, and associated dimension
reduction algorithms. Our analytical platform houses four liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry platform
for accurate and sensitive determination of drug concentrations in biological fluids and tissues. Our lab is ideally
set up to support the projects and clinical core and cross-fertilize their proposed activities."
10830995,"Treatment of TB is defined by two factors: the requirement for combination chemotherapy and
extended duration of therapy. For antibiotic sensitive disease, the shortest duration of therapy
that will cure >95% of treated subjects is 2 months of INH/RIF/PZA/ETH, followed by 4 months of
INH/RIF (2HRZE/4HR). However, abundant clinical trial evidence indicates that the majority of
treated subjects are cured with shorter durations of treatment, yet we lack any clinical or laboratory
biomarkers that can identify these candidates for treatment shortening. The antimicrobials used
to treat TB, both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant, are predominantly mycobacterial-specific and
until recently, their effects on the gut microbiome were unknown. In the first award period, this Tri-
I TBRU pioneered the analysis of the intestinal microbiome in TB infection and thereby advanced
the idea that the intestinal microbiome is an unexplored cofactor in TB susceptibility and response
to therapy. We found, in both cross sectional and longitudinal studies of human subjects with TB,
that HRZE therapy has rapid, but long-lasting, effects on intestinal microbiome composition:
Clostridiales are depleted, with relative preservation of other taxons. Clostridiales are critical
components of the microbiota that interact with the host immune system through production of
diverse chemical mediators including short chain fatty acids as well as other metabolites.
Accordingly, we have also found, using new statistical modeling techniques developed during the
prior award period, that the resolution of TB disease can be modeled as a combined effect of
pathogen (Mtb) sterilization and the immune effects of antimycobacterial-induced microbiome
perturbation. Our overriding hypothesis is that individual differences in microbiome composition
and function, either pretreatment or induced by antimycobacterials during treatment, are
associated with, and predictive of, different rates of pathogen clearance, resolution of
inflammatory markers of active TB, and ultimately treatment success (both early sterilization and
lack of relapse). We propose studies that will expand this concept to 1) validate microbiome
derived biomarkers of TB treatment success; 2) develop predictive computational models that
integrate microbiome, transcriptomic, and microbiologic data to predict treatment success; 3) yield
mechanistic insight into the interaction of microbiome driven immunomodulation and TB disease.
Coupled with the other projects and cores of this TBRU, this project will advance our
understanding of the control of paucibacillary TB."
10831001,"Project Summary
Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a major health problem. About a quarter of
the world population is infected, yet only a minority develop TB, either during primary infection, or later during
secondary infection or reactivation of latent Mtb. Genetic epidemiological evidence strongly suggests that TB is
driven by human genetic predisposition. Its molecular basis has been dissected since 2000. We discovered 2
types of inborn errors of immunity (IEI) underlying TB, both impairing interferon (IFN)-γ immunity: (i) rare IEI,
such as autosomal recessive complete IL-12Rβ1 and TYK2 deficiencies, found in a few TB patients, and (ii) a
common IEI due to homozygosity for the TYK2 missense P1104A variant that selectively disrupts IL-23-
dependent IFN-γ immunity, accounting for up to 1% of European TB cases. These findings provided proof of
principle that there are both rare and common monogenic etiologies of human TB, in specific ethnicities, and
established that TYK2-dependent IFN-γ production is essential for protective immunity to Mtb. However, the vast
majority of TB patients lack a genetic etiology. We hypothesize that TB is the consequence of a diverse collection
of monogenic or digenic IEI, with incomplete or more rarely complete penetrance, and in a sizeable proportion
of populations of diverse ancestries. To discover these variants, our project will combine a candidate gene
approach focused on rare and common coding TYK2 variants with a genome-wide search for rare and common
variants in other genes. TB patients will be recruited in Haiti with a specific focus on patients belonging to families
with at least two TB-affected siblings, and/or with recurrent forms of TB, as these patients are more likely to carry
IEI. Our project will also take advantage of our previously recruited TB patients in Haiti and worldwide (>1,500),
following a strategy combining: (i) a comprehensive genetic study based on next generation sequencing (>900
samples with whole exome sequencing data already available) to search for candidate TB-causing variants using
cutting-edge computational analyses under different genetic hypotheses (genetic heterogeneity or homogeneity,
monogenic or digenic inheritance), and (ii) in-depth functional studies to biochemically characterize the proteins
encoded by the newly discovered candidate variants, and to validate their causal role immunologically at the
molecular and cellular levels. We will also test whether the effects of these IEI may be influenced by Mtb strains
using a specific host-pathogen interaction study in Haitian patients. Our preliminary data indicate that this
approach is fruitful, as we already identified strong candidate genotypes, including both bi-allelic loss-of-function
rare variations in TYK2, TNF, BTN2A2, and PDCD1, and mono- or bi-allelic common variations in IL10RA and
HLA-DRB1. Our search for rare and common variants underlying monogenic or digenic IEI that govern the
development of TB with high penetrance will decipher mechanisms of protective immunity to Mtb in humans.
This approach will also pave the way to new preventive or therapeutic approaches, aiming to rescue genetically
deficient immune responses in patients at risk of, or with TB."
10829419,"SUMMARY
The long-term goal of our research is to develop effective anticoagulants that do not cause bleeding
complications to be safely used for a wider range of patients suffering from venous thromboembolism (VTE).
This project aims at developing effective and safer anticoagulants by targeting human factor XIIIa (FXIIIa). All
available anticoagulants are associated with a significant risk of bleeding. Current anticoagulants inhibit directly
or indirectly thrombin and/or factor Xa. This is the reason why they are clinically effective, but it is also the
reason why they cause bleeding. The central hypothesis is that inhibiting FXIIIa will result in effective
protection against VTE without causing significant bleeding. In contrast to all other clotting factors which are
serine proteases, FXIIIa is a transglutaminase that catalyzes the last step in the coagulation process. This
unique biochemical aspect of FXIIIa has been under investigation in the context of VTE. In vitro experiments
showed that treating normal human blood with an experimental transglutaminase inhibitor increases RBC
extrusion from contracting clots and reduces clot size. Various studies also suggested that a certain FXIIIa
polymorphism provides significant protection against VTE and that heterozygous FXIII-deficient mice do not
show signs of excessive bleeding. Thus, FXIIIa may serve as a potential therapeutic target to develop a new
effective treatment for VTE that does not significantly increase the bleeding risk. Despite this promise, very few
FXIIIa inhibitors have been developed, all of which lack substantial selectivity as they can also inhibit other
transglutaminases by blocking their active sites. Thus, I have proposed sulfonated non-saccharide glycos-
aminoglycan mimetics as a platform to develop FXIIIa inhibitors. The sulfonated molecules are to inhibit FXIIIa
potently and selectively through allosteric modulation. In preliminary studies, I discovered two sulfonated
molecules that inhibit FXIIIa with low micromolar potencies. The two molecules inhibited FXIIIa-mediated
polymerization of fibrin. The two molecules did not affect other clotting factors and did not affect the viability of
three cell lines. Molecular modeling projected a plausible binding site for these molecules on FXIIIa. In this
proposal, I specifically aim at using a multidisciplinary approach to establish the principles of effective and
selective inhibition of FXIIIa by sulfonated molecules. I will synthesize advanced libraries of two “lead”
molecules and evaluate their biochemical and biological potential as anticoagulants. The proposal is
innovative because i) it puts forward a novel approach to overcome the limitations of current VTE treatment; ii)
it exploits a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the specific aims; and iii) it introduces new technologies
with proprietary structural and mechanistic aspects. The project is also significant because it will: i) identify
2-3 potent, specific, and allosteric FXIIIa inhibitors for future evaluation in animal models of VTE and bleeding;
ii) offer new tools to better understand FXIIIa role in the coagulation physiology and pathology; iii) investigate
an alternative approach to modulate FXIIIa via allostery to pave the way to transforming anticoagulants."
10874457,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by accumulation of misfolded proteins in disease-specific neural
circuits, which disrupts normal neuronal functions, including axonal transport, mitochondrial bioenergetics, gene
expression, and synaptic connectivity. In addition, there is compelling evidence that neuroinflammation can also
initiate and/or facilitate disease progression. These results support an interconnected mechanism, in which
protein misfolding and neuroinflammation synergistically promote disease progression in a feed-forward manner.
Among the major neurodegenerative diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) affects upper and lower motor
neurons and is often associated with aggressive clinical courses. Although the majority of ALS cases are
sporadic, ~10% are caused by mutations that affect RNA metabolism, intracellular vesicular trafficking, and
protein homeostasis via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways (proteostasis). Characterizations of these cellular
functions provide critical windows to understand disease mechanism and to intervene its onset and progression.
During the past funding period, we showed that misfolded proteins activate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
and its downstream signaling pathways, including stress-activated kinase, homeodomain interacting protein
kinase 2 (HIPK2), to promote neuronal cell death. We developed highly sensitive biochemical, morphological
and functional assays to show that ER stress activates HIPK2 and that HIPK2 activation can be detected in the
spinal motor neurons of pre-symptomatic SOD1G93A and NEFH-tTA/tetO-hTDP-43DNLS mouse ALS models,
suggesting that HIPK2 activation directly contributes to neurodegeneration. In support of this idea, loss of HIPK2
or blocking HIPK2 kinase activity significantly protects motor neurons from cell death induced by SOD1G93A or
TDP-43. To broaden our understanding of HIPK2 in neurodegeneration, we further showed that HIPK2 can
regulate neuronal survival and cell death via transcriptional regulation of gene expression and by regulating
Parkin protein levels via proteasome-mediated pathway. In addition, we performed proteomic screens to
characterize HIPK2 interactomes and identified HSPA9 (also known as Mortalin) as a HIPK2 interacting partner.
Together, these results support the hypothesis that HIPK2 and its interactomes regulate a delicate balance of
neuronal survival and cell death via both cell autonomous and glia-mediated mechanisms. To test this, we
propose to (1) characterize the role of HSPA9 in neuronal cell death during development and in
neurodegeneration, (2) delineate the mechanism of HIPK2 in neuroinflammation in ALS, and (3) perform single
cell transcriptomics to elucidate the role of ER stress and neuroinflammation in SALS and C9-ALS. Collectively,
results from this proposal will provide a more complete understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms
of HIPK2 in stress-induced neurodegeneration in ALS."
10844382,"The wound healing process that follows intra-abdominal surgery results in the formation of peritoneal adhesions
which occurs in over 90% percent of patients who undergo this type of procedure. Peritoneal adhesions are
fibrotic tissue that contains significant numbers of myofibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).
Peritoneal adhesions can lead to a multitude of complications, including bowel obstructions. Bowel obstructions
have been implicated in severe morbidity and create a risk of mortality. Surgical interventions can be used to
remove peritoneal adhesions, but there is a risk of recurrence of adhesive disease in these patients. Therefore,
new therapies for the prevention and/or reversal of peritoneal adhesions are urgently needed.
Myofibroblasts and VSMCs have the capacity to secrete and remodel extracellular matrix. These processes have
been implicated as an important function to aid in fibrotic diseases. Platelet derived growth factor receptors α
and β (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ) are involved in many diseases including fibrosis. PDGFRα is typically expressed
in fibroblastic cells, whereas PDGFRβ is expressed in mural cells such as VSMCs. PDGF signaling in these cells
has been shown to induce mechanotransduction pathways by promoting actin assembly. Actin assembly can
induce the activity of Myocardin-Related Transcriptions Factors (MRTFs) and the YAP1 transcriptional cofactor.
The goal of this research program is to examine whether PDGF signaling promotes the formation of peritoneal
adhesions by activating actin assembly and thereby inducing the activity of MRTFs and YAP1. We will
accomplish this goal by using novel in vivo approaches such as cell ablation techniques in PDGFR+ positive cells
in mice. These cell types will also be molecularly characterized using NuTrap technology that allows us to identify
novel pathways that may promote the formation of peritoneal adhesions. Moreover, we will investigate the
consequences of inhibiting mechanotransduction pathways in these same cell types. Lastly, we will validate our
findings in cells isolated from patients’ peritoneal adhesion tissue.
At the end of these studies, we will have gained new insights into molecular mechanisms that drive the formation
of peritoneal adhesions. Specifically, we will learn whether the interplay between PDGF signaling and the
mechanotransduction pathways in PDGFRα+ and/or PDGFRβ+ cells. This knowledge may enable us to identify
novel approaches to prevent or reduce the formation of peritoneal adhesions and potentially other forms of
fibrosis."
10835930,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P), the most common craniofacial birth defect, is caused by im-
paired fusion of the facial prominences. During normal morphogenesis, the frontonasal and maxillary promi-
nences fuse at a three-way seam, the lambdoidal junction (l), to form the upper lip/primary palate. If the epithe-
lium that covers the prominences persists at the l, orofacial clefting ensues, as we previously reported in mouse
embryos deficient for PBX transcription factors (TFs). We described that: 1) prominence fusion requires coordi-
nation of two distinct cellular behaviors, apoptosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), respectively,
in two discrete subpopulations within the l epithelium; 2) these two subpopulations are characterized by different
molecular signatures; and 3) mice deficient for PBX TFs with CL/P lack both of these epithelial subpopulations.
Our preliminary evidence in the mouse indicates that: I) the λ epithelium is heterogeneous and comprises 6 main
cell subpopulations prior to prominence fusion, as demonstrated by single cell RNA sequencing; II) one of the
subpopulations, that we termed “l fusion effectors”, is enriched for genes that have been associated with human
or mouse orofacial clefting, for genes encoding pro-apoptotic factors, and for inhibitors of cell cycle progression;
III) “l fusion effector” cells are located at the tip of the prominences; and IV) the proportion of “l fusion effectors”
is perturbed in compound Pbx1/2 mutant embryos with CL/P compared to controls. Based on these results, we
posit that the “l fusion effector” cluster comprises cells that are prime executors of prominence fusion; is halted
in the cell cycle, a prerequisite for subsequent cellular changes, like apoptosis and EMT, to achieve fusion; and
is quantitatively and/or qualitatively perturbed in mouse models of CL/P. We will test this hypothesis via the
following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of the epithelial “l fusion effector”
subpopulation throughout midface prominence fusion. We will establish whether the “l fusion effector” clus-
ter is transient or if it persists after fusion, as well as track the progenitors and descendants of “l fusion effector”
cells in vivo across space and developmental time. 2) Establish the molecular mechanisms underlying cell
cycle arrest in “l fusion effector” cells during upper lip/primary palate fusion. We will uncover in vivo cell
cycle dynamics of “l fusion effector” cells and assess whether PBX-dependent regulation of cell cycle genes
mediates cell cycle control in this cluster. 3) Determine whether the perturbations of the “λ fusion effector”
cluster in Pbx1/2 mutants are recapitulated in p63- or Bmpr1a-deficient mice with CL/P. We will establish
whether the cellular and transcriptional changes of the l epithelium resulting in CL/P in Pbx1/2 mutants are
recapitulated in all three mouse models, or if they are distinct. This research will lead to discover new genes for
prenatal diagnostics of CL/P and open strategies for CL/P repair through reactivation of developmental programs
that are defective in orofacial clefting. Broadly, this work will foster mechanistic studies testing whether other
fusion processes are mediated by cell cycle arrest."
10849812,"Despite ongoing surveillance and control efforts, group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains an
important cause of infectious morbidity and mortality among newborns, as well as an increasing
cause of invasive disease in adults. GBS vaccine development is a high priority, and a
candidate conjugate polysaccharide vaccine is currently in human trials. This vaccine targets six
of the ten known GBS serotypes, based on epidemiologic studies of invasive disease as well as
rectovaginal carriage. Serotype distribution data are largely based on assays of single colonies
from clinical samples. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that carriage of non-
vaccine type (NVT) GBS (serotypes VI-IX) is substantially more common than previously
realized. Additionally, invasive infections due to NVT GBS are increasing in frequency. It is not
known whether the less common GBS serotypes are intrinsically less fit than the more common
ones with respect to colonization efficiency or pathogenicity. Likewise, the importance of
recently characterized naturally occurring ""capsule switch"" GBS strains, in which the genetic
locus that determines capsular type has transferred from one strain to another, remains
incompletely understood. Here we propose a program of research designed to test hypotheses
regarding the prevalence of (and risk factors for) colonization and invasive infection due to NVT
GBS serotypes in human samples and to use newly developed techniques for GBS genome
manipulation to understand the role of specific capsule and non-capsule factors in colonization
fitness and pathogenesis in vivo."

academic and non-academic positions. Students trained in this program will be exposed to a wide range of
scientific concepts and techniques, meet diverse experts across the physical, life and medical sciences, and be
uniquely situated to tackle challenges in human health from a molecular level perspective."
10814777,"Project Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM), a cancer of plasma cells that colonize the bone marrow (BM), remains incurable despite
the use of new promising treatment modalities. This is partly due to (i) MM progression and drug resistance
development, (ii) protection of MM cells by the BM microenvironment (BMME), and (iii) immune evasion. Thus,
there is urgent need for innovative and more effective therapies, particularly for patients with advanced disease
refractory to conventional agents. MicroRNAs (miRs) play critical roles in the initiation, progression, and drug
resistance of various human cancer types, including MM, and are providing exciting opportunities in our ongoing
search for novel and more effective cancer therapies. We recently documented that: (i) the miR-30-5p family
serves as an MM-tumor suppressor targeting BCL9, a critical Wnt/-catenin co-activator, highly expressed in
BM endothelial cells (BMECs), that promotes BM colonization and proliferation of MM cells, (ii) the miR-221/222
cluster is overexpressed in MM cells from patients who have become unresponsive to dexamethasone, and
functions as an MM oncogene by targeting PUMA and inhibiting apoptosis, and (iii) miR-30c-5p and miR-221/222
are expressed in murine immune cells, and we can identify murine macrophages within MM tumors engrafted in
mice. The main challenge for miR-based therapy is the need for safe and effective delivery methods. Unless
chemically modified or physically encapsulated, miRs are unstable in the blood and do not easily cross the cell
membrane. Nanoparticles (NPs) encompass a variety of submicron-sized macromolecules that have been used
successfully as vehicles for various agents, including miRs, enabling these agents to reach cellular targets
previously considered undruggable. The Langer lab has successfully engineered a diverse library of polymeric
NPs, of which one exemplar, 7C1NP, was shown to be non-toxic and effective in delivering siRNAs to BMECs
in mice. My lab subsequently showed that the 7C1NP formulation can deliver siRNAs/miRs not only to human
BMECs but also to MM cells as well as murine immune cells in vivo. The overarching goal of this project is to
take advantage of the 7C1NP delivery system to (i) uncover possible new targets of, and roles for, miR-30-5p
and miR-221/222 in MM progression; and (ii) explore the potential of these polymer-encapsulated miRs for MM
therapy via miR-30-5p “replacement therapy” to target BCL9 in BMECs, and inhibit MM growth in the BM, and
(b) miR-221/222 “antisense (as) therapy” to target PUMA in MM cells and enhance apoptosis while abrogating
acquired resistance to Lenalidomide, and Bortezomib, and (b) investigate the effect of these therapies on other
immune cells and MM-associated macrophage polarization. The proposed studies are significant to public health
in that they will be performed with MM cells lines and MM cells from patients and utilizing clinically relevant
mouse xenograft models of MM that take in consideration the heterotypic interactions between MM cells and the
BMME and their ultimate goal is to improve patient outcome with more efficacious therapies that alleviate
suffering, and reduce the overall treatment cost of not only MM but potentially other hematologic malignancies."
10824378,"ABSTRACT
Neuroinflammation has emerged as a critical component of secondary injury and disease progression following
brain trauma. Recent pre-clinical studies have shed light on the neurotoxic effects of peripheral innate immunity.
Our preliminary findings suggest this overzealous response may be mediated by EphA4/mTOR signaling which
negatively regulates the anti-inflammatory state of peripheral-derived monocyte/macrophages (PDMs). The
research objective of this application is to characterize the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) underlying
innate immunity and PDM polarization status in the regulation of tissue damage and functional recovery following
TBI. Our proposal builds upon extensive preliminary and published data demonstrating a distinct protective and
reduced pro-inflammatory response in the absence of peripheral EphA4 using chimeric mice following controlled
cortical impact (CCI) injury. Interestingly, PDMs-derived from EphA4null mice directly confer neuroprotection and
blood brain-barrier preservation in a model of monocyte depletion and replacement. Moreover, we discovered
that PDM-specific EphA4 suppresses phosphorylation of key proteins involved in the mTOR pathway, a novel
mediator of the pro-resolving state of PDMs. We hypothesize that EphA4 mediates the pro-inflammatory innate
immune response by suppressing mTOR signaling, which induces PDM infiltration, polarization and phenotypic
behaviors that drive neurovascular dysfunction following TBI. We will employ cell-specific depletions, and PDM
replacement as well as novel transgenic murine models. These approaches will include rigorous behavioral,
histological and innovative low-input genome-wide epigenomic and transcriptomic assessment of the relevance
and mechanism(s) of PDM behaviors. We will also provide a framework for retooling the neuroinflammatory
response to accelerate recovery and dampen pro-inflammatory processes after TBI."
10817832,"Late stage ovarian cancer is marked by poor patient survival and significant metastatic spread throughout the
peritoneal cavity. During transcoelomic spread cells must adapt to survive anchorage-independence and to cope
with stress associated with matrix detachment and the hostile environment of the ascites. Preliminary findings
demonstrate that an important ovarian cancer cell adaptation during anchorage-independence is the up-
regulation of two mitochondrial proteins, superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2), and its regulator, the metabolic and
redox sensing deacetylase SIRT3. Moreover, these proteins are necessary for anchorage-independent cell
survival and transcoelomic metastasis in vivo. In addition to Sod2’s role as a mitochondrial superoxide
scavenger, mechanistic data show that Sod2 shifts the redox landscape of cancer cells to a higher hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) steady-state. This novel non-canonical function of Sod2 as a H2O2 regulator results in
mitochondrial redox signaling, as demonstrated by oxidation and inactivation of phosphatases, and enhanced
Akt signaling. Preliminary data demonstrate that SIRT3 is an important regulator of Sod2 during anchorage-
independence, which points to a novel pro-survival role for SIRT3 during ovarian cancer spread. Thus, the
proposal will test the hypothesize that mitochondrial redox signaling is an important regulator of survival
adaptations in response to matrix detachment, and that two key mitochondrial proteins, SIRT3 and Sod2, are
required for the initiation and regulation of mitochondrial redox signaling in anchorage-independence. This will
be addressed using a combination of cell culture models, patient ascites-derived cells, in vivo mouse xenograft
models, and molecular, biochemical and imaging techniques to monitor oxidants and redox signaling. Using both
unbiased screens and targeted approaches Aim 1 consists of mechanistic studies to delineate how SIRT3/Sod2-
regulated mitochondrial H2O2-signaling drives anchorage-independent survival. In Aim 2 the mechanisms of
SIRT3 activity and transcriptional regulation will be elucidated how SIRT3 acts as the sensor of matrix
detachment in the context of metabolic changes associated with anchorage-independence. In proof-of-principle
studies of Aim 3 the vulnerability of Sod2-high tumor cells will be targeted with two approaches based exploiting
their sensitivity to H2O2 generating agents and Akt inhibition. Establishing that mitochondrial redox signaling is a
necessary adaptation for ovarian cancer anchorage-independent survival and metastasis is crucial in our long-
term goal of targeting key metastatic adaptations for novel therapies against ovarian cancer."
10789993,"Higher risk of poor neurodevelopment during infancy and early childhood has been reported among infants who
are HIV exposed in utero but uninfected (iHEU) compared to their HIV unexposed counterparts, and both HIV
and antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens may contribute to the increased risk. In utero exposure to protease
inhibitors (PI) has been linked to poorer language and social-emotional development compared to non-PI-
containing regimens in iHEU. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends dolutegravir (DTG),
an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), as a component of a preferred ART regimen during pregnancy.
Whether fetal exposure to INSTIs is associated with neurodevelopment delays among iHEU has not been well
studied. In adults, administration of PI-based regimens has been linked to altered gut microbiota and increased
systemic inflammation compared to INSTI-based regimens. However, it is unknown whether fetal exposure only
to these regimens could provoke similar effects. As early life gut microbiome and immune activation have been
shown to be crucial for development of immune maturation and cognitive functions, alongside recent descriptions
of associations with neurodevelopment, it is pivotal to explore associations between fetal exposure to different
maternal ART regimens, early life gut microbiome composition and function, systemic inflammation and
neurodevelopment among iHEU. We hypothesize that early life gut microbial communities and their function
differ among iHEU by fetal exposure to maternal PI- versus INSTI-based regimens, leading to differential
increases in systemic inflammation. We expect such alterations to parallel infant neurodevelopmental outcomes,
even when ARV exposure is limited to the in utero period. We will leverage the Surveillance Monitoring for ART
Toxicities (SMARTT) study within the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) network, which provides
rigorously prospectively collected data, neurodevelopmental testing, and a sample repository that will enable us
to address our hypothesis in a cohort of 200 iHEU SMARTT participants with the following specific aims:
 Specific Aim 1: To evaluate meconium microbiome diversity, composition and function among iHEU by
maternal antiretroviral regimen during pregnancy.
Specific Aim 2: To evaluate levels of systemic inflammation among iHEU by maternal antiretroviral
regimen during pregnancy.
Specific Aim 3: To assess associations between meconium microbiome, systemic inflammation and
 neurodevelopment in iHEU.
The proposed project will provide critical preliminary data to design further investigations and interventions of
modifiable biological domains among iHEU that may inform neurodevelopmental health of this growing
population, as well as ART guidelines during pregnancy, which might ultimately result in decreased morbidity of
iHEU, or other populations of infants exposed to ARVs during pregnancy."
10837784,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 With growing concerns regarding the environment and sustainability, there is an increasing
demand for integrating green chemistry and green engineering into the pharmaceutical industry.
Electrochemical organic synthesis represents a green and advantageous alternative to traditional
synthetic methods because it directly uses electrons from a power source to complete the redox
transformations, which can cut down on the usage of chemicals, reduce waste, and offer
improvements in cost, safety, and sustainability. However, the current reaction library of
electrosynthetic methods is limited. Therefore, there is a critical need for new electrolytic methods
that offer new chemical reactivities.
 The proposal is focused on studying the mostly unexplored alternating current electrolysis for
organic synthesis. Unlike the conventional electroorganic synthetic methods using a constant
voltage or current, alternating current electrolysis uses an alternating voltage to drive the redox
transformations of substrates. Alternating current electrolysis offers a unique reaction
environment where two redox-opposite reactions can occur spatially and temporally close to each
other and can be easily adjustable by merely controlling the alternating current voltage supply.
The overall goal of this proposal is to exploit this unique reaction environment of alternating
current electrolysis to achieve new reactivities that are not currently accessible by the existing
synthetic methodologies, serving as a critical step towards the long-term vision of the electrically
driven green synthesis of drugs."
10837898,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Reversing the developmental switch from fetal (HbF) to adult hemoglobin is an important therapeutic
approach in sickle cell disease (SCD). HbF expression in healthy adults, patients with SCD, or those treated with
pharmacologic HbF inducers is distributed heterogeneously in a subset of cells called “F-cells”; increasing the
number of F-cells as well as the HbF content in each F-cell are both important for treatment of SCD. I have
developed techniques for purification and characterization of primary human F-cells and their comparison to
equivalent A-cells, which do not express HbF. My preliminary data show that the two cell types differ primarily in
their globin content but not in expression of any known HbF regulators, and that F-cells have increased long-
range chromatin contacts between the locus control region (LCR) enhancer and the promoters of the g-globin
genes. My preliminary studies and the experiments proposed in this proposal represent the first attempt to
characterize F-cells by direct comparison to A-cells. I propose to further characterize F-cells from healthy adults,
patients with SCD, and following treatment with three pharmacologic HbF inducers using cutting-edge
techniques for studies of transcriptional bursting kinetics, chromatin accessibility and long-range chromatin
interactions. In addition, I will explore the function of three chromatin remodeling enzymes identified in a loss of
function genetic screen for modulators of HbF expression. My proposed studies will further our understanding of
the mechanisms of HbF regulation and heterogeneity of HbF expression in clinically important contexts and will
guide the development of more effective therapeutics for sickle cell disease.
 This proposal describes a five-year training plan for the development of my independent research career as
an academic pediatric hematologist physician-scientist studying red cell biology and hemoglobin regulation. I am
an Instructor in Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania and an attending physician in the Division of
Hematology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) with previous PhD training in cell and molecular

enlisted an advisory committee composed of scientists and physician-scientists with complimentary expertise
and mentoring experience, and have the full resources of CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania available
for the completion of my research and career development goals. Completion of this proposal in a mentored
environment will leave me optimally positioned for a career as an independent physician-scientist."
10817004,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of the proposed studies is to understand how HIV-1 sequence diversity impacts viral genome
dimerization, a requirement for viral replication. Like nearly all retroviruses, HIV-1 selectively packages two
copies of its full-length genome after the formation of a dimer – a process essential not only to packaging, but
also reverse transcription and recombination. The sponsor’s lab took a pioneering role in the structural
characterization of the highly conserved HIV-1 dimeric 5′-leader, the region believed to initiate genome
dimerization. Several outstanding questions remain regarding the mechanism and structures involved in the
process. Current proposals support a two-step mechanism beginning with a kissing-loop interface that then
matures into a more extensive intermolecular interface. While in vitro studies support this mechanism, most are
isolated to RNA fragments or ignore important cellular/viral factors. Studies of HIV genome dimerization are also
complicated by the enormous genome plasticity of HIV-1 that is driven by mutation and recombination, leading
to sequence diversity within the dimer interface. This diversity stratifies strains into two dimer classes, those that
are thermodynamically stable (nonlabile strains) and those that readily dissociate (labile strains). I will
characterize the differences between these two dimer classes by studying two model HIV-1 strains in the context
of the intact dimeric interface in solution, in cells, and in viruses: NL4-3 (nonlabile) and MAL (labile). Current
methods to study labile dimers are limited, as they readily dissociate in native gel electrophoresis assays;
therefore, suggesting a need to rely upon methods that will assess the equilibrium, solution state for each strain.
We will begin with a biophysical characterization of both strains, specifically characterizing the thermodynamics,
kinetics, and structures of the dimeric interface using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) and Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) (Aim 1). Preliminary FCS data has shown our ability to monitor dimer formation at
concentrations and timescales previously inaccessible. Preliminary data using our 2H-edited NMR approach
suggest we can directly probe for intermolecular interactions in the full-length, dimeric HIV-1 MAL 5′-leader (>230
kDa), allowing us direct comparison with the previously characterized NL4-3 extended dimer. I will also compare
the dimerization process of these two strains in cells and viruses (Aim 2). We have now collected initial in vitro
data validating our novel fluorescent labeling strategy to discriminate intermolecular and intramolecular RNA
interactions that can now be applied in the context of viral replication in cells. We hypothesize that labile dimers
exhibit primarily a kissing dimer structure throughout assembly, highlighting a higher stability to the kissing dimer
than was previously thought, as well as implying the existence of a strain specific dimerization mechanism.
Successful completion of this project will also provide quantitative spatial and temporal characterization of HIV-
1 genome dimerization as RNAs are trafficked to assembly sites on the plasma membrane as well as allow us
to monitor changes in the dimer interface that potentially occur during virus assembly and maturation."
10788457,"Studies of brain tissues from people living with HIV (PLWH) age from 38-60 years, showed increased
amyloid plaques and tau hyperphosphorylation compared to age-matched HIV-negative subjects. PLWH who
are on antiretroviral therapy (ART) live longer but experience neurodegenerative conditions related to HIV as
they age. In 2018, 51% of PLWH in the U.S. were age 50 or older, and in the next 5-10 years, this population
will be in their sixties, the prime age when Alzheimer’s disease (AD) symptoms begin to manifest. Further,
premature aging with HIV infection is reported to affect neurocognition in PLWH. Since aging is a significant risk
factor for AD development and HIV can cause premature aging, it's critically important to examine the relationship
between HIV-induced aging and AD.
 Compared to age-matched HIV-negative subjects, studies of brain tissues from people living with HIV
(PLWH) aged 38-60 showed increased amyloid plaques and tau hyperphosphorylation. However, the underlying
mechanism by which HIV causes AD-associated neurodegeneration and memory impairment in PLWH is not
well studied. Moreover, due to the inability of ARVs to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the current ARV
regimens are insufficient in suppressing HIV in the brain, which can further exacerbate neurodegenerative
conditions in the aged HIV population. Our preliminary studies have shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs)
derived from HIV-infected macrophages carry higher pro-inflammatory cytokines and low antioxidant enzymes.
Further, exposure of these EVs from HIV-infected macrophages to SH-SY5Y neuronal cells caused increased
toxicity, IL-1β levels, and neuronal loss (MAP2). We have also demonstrated that EVs administered by the
intranasal route can bypass the BBB and be detected in the brain.
 Further, we showed that the elvitegravir (an antiretroviral drug) could be loaded into EVs and delivered
across the BBB in an in vitro model. This proposal will elucidate the role of the HIV components packaged in
EVs in causing AD-like pathology through the TXNIP inflammatory pathway. We will also use EVs as
nanocarriers to improve curcumin (TXNIP inhibitor) and EVG levels across the BBB, thus effectively suppressing
inflammation with minimal/tolerable drug toxicity."
10817915,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Discrimination contributes to mental and physical health disparities disproportionately disadvantaging minority
populations. Yet, the impact of discrimination on behavioral health outcomes such as substance use (SU) is
less clear, particularly in early life (e.g. late childhood and early adolescence). By middle adolescence, SU
initiation is set in motion triggering subsequent developmental trajectories. Investigating the onset of SU,
starting in late childhood, is critical for mitigating its downstream health consequences. There is even less
science focused on multilevel factors that alleviate associations between discrimination and SU. This project
addresses these gaps in developmental and health disparities science by investigating adolescents'
experiences of multiple forms of discrimination (based on ethnicity/race, country of origin, sexual orientation,
weight) and SU (self-report & hair sample metabolites) from late childhood to middle adolescence, and by
investigating sleep (parent-report & actigraphy duration & quality) and neighborhood environment (deprivation,
crime, noise, structural discrimination from geocodes) as moderators of the health impact of discrimination.
Both sleep and neighborhood environment can be targeted by evidence-based programming as levers of
change to reduce the impact of discrimination on SU. The project draws from the on-going, national,
longitudinal study of Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD), the largest national study of its kind
that follows 11,875 children (9-10 years old) through adolescence. The project examines three research aims.
First, the study investigates concurrent and longitudinal linkages between discrimination and SU, from late
childhood to early adolescence, disentangling whether discrimination is a contributing or a resulting factor of
SU initiation and continuation. Second, the study investigates the extent to which the linkages between
discrimination and SU are conditioned by young people's sleep. Finally, the study investigates the moderating
role of neighborhood environment in linking discrimination, sleep, and SU, from late childhood to middle
adolescence. For all research aims, the proposed project also explores how the associations of discrimination,
SU, sleep, and neighborhood environment change from late childhood to adolescence, by testing multiple
development-related differences (i.e., by data collection wave, developmental stage, age, grade level).
Findings will elucidate critical developmental periods when interventions are most effective in helping young
people from marginalized populations (ethnicity/race, immigration status, sexual orientation, and body shape)
navigate the negative health consequences of prejudice and exclusion. Essentially, this project will provide
critical insights for youth SU programs including who is most at risk, what to target, and when to intervene."

Gender minorities (GM) have gained greater visibility in U.S. society in recent years. However, the physical
and mental health of GM individuals remains a critical public health issue. GM face persistent stigma,
discrimination, and barriers to services that affect their health and wellbeing over the life course. Gender
affirmation is a process of recognizing a person’s gender identity and expression, which may include emotional
support as well as social and medical interventions; it has been associated with mental health and wellbeing.
Unmet needs for gender affirmation have been linked to greater risk behavior and poorer self-care among GM,
particularly related to HIV risk and treatment. Clinicians who are specially trained in providing gender-affirming
services may be uniquely positioned to support the emotional needs of GM individuals, with the potential to
have a long-term impact on a person’s trust and comfort in interacting with healthcare providers, engagement
and retention in care, and self-care behaviors that influence one’s health trajectory over the life course.
 There is a dearth of evidence on the healthcare needs of GM individuals after surgery, their
psychosocial adjustment during this phase of their identity development, their quality of life, and long-term
physical and emotional wellbeing. The goal of this prospective, mixed method, longitudinal cohort study is to
build a rich evidence base on GM identity development after gender-affirming surgery and the long-term
healthcare needs of GM individuals, examining changes in multiple domains of quality of life and their
relationships with healthcare providers. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, our
specific aims are to:
1. Document changes over time in GM individuals’ (N = 300 recruited from a gender-affirming, post-surgical
 home healthcare program) psychosocial development after surgery, including such domains as (i) gender
 and sexual identity development, (ii) intimacy and relationships, (iii) social and community support, (iv)
 employment and financial wellbeing, and (v) environmental mastery and purpose in life.
2. Examine changes in GM individuals’ health-related quality of life after surgery, including such domains as
 (i) physical health, (ii) mental health and social wellbeing, (iii) sexual function, satisfaction and health, (iv)
 health behaviors and self-care, and (v) engagement and retention in healthcare and relationships with
 healthcare providers.
3. Identify barriers and facilitators to GM individuals’ engagement with their self-care and engagement and
 retention in home and subsequent healthcare for both gender-related and other health concerns.
The study will address a significant gap in the current evidence on best practices to support GM individuals
during a pivotal life course transition, with the potential to improve their engagement in care and mitigate the
pervasive disparities in healthcare access, outcomes, and quality of life affecting this population."

This application is for a five-year extension of funding for the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG)
– an open collaborative network of over 100 sites and over 300 pediatric ophthalmologists and pediatric
optometrists dedicated to conducting investigator-initiated clinical research in strabismus, amblyopia, and other
childhood eye conditions. The organization of the PEDIG network enhances efficiency and quality while reducing
costs by having a single infrastructure with the ability to conduct multiple concurrent and consecutive studies.
Since its inception in 1997, PEDIG has published 130 manuscripts and conducted 46 randomized clinical trials
or prospective observational studies on childhood eye conditions such as amblyopia, strabismus, nasolacrimal
duct obstruction, refractive error, ROP, pediatric optic neuritis, and pediatric cataract. In the current grant cycle
(2019-2023), the 8 protocols that were active at the beginning of the grant cycle will have been completed and
12 new protocols will have been initiated (3 will be completed during the current grant cycle and 9 will remain
active). PEDIG studies have changed the practice standard of pediatric eye care and have become the
foundation for the American Academy of Ophthalmology’s evidence-based Preferred Practice Pattern for
amblyopia. The proposed studies in the current application would continue to advance the field in an evidence-
based direction, improving care and quality of life for children.
Despite these contributions, there remain important knowledge gaps. To address these gaps, PEDIG will
continue to expand the evidence base for treating several pediatric eye conditions, including: (1) amblyopia, (2)
strabismus, (3) myopia, (4) chalazia, (5) ROP, and (6) cerebral visual impairment (CVI). PEDIG will create an
additional layer to its organizational structure to form 6 Disease-Area Working Groups that will provide support
for development of investigator-initiated study ideas. PEDIG will also explore new methodologies to increase
access to pediatric eye care by developing and implementing a novel, home-based visual acuity testing
application, studying the use of ocular imaging in telehealth, and creating a comprehensive web- or phone
application-based amblyopia treatment guide for general eye care providers that assimilates results from PEDIG
and other amblyopia research, allowing for real-time decision making.
PEDIG will continue to perform high-impact clinical studies to provide rigorous evidence for the optimal treatment
of pediatric eye conditions. The network’s reach will also extend into new areas, in alignment with the NEI
strategic plan, where the full breadth of the network’s size and expertise can be leveraged to create robust
evidence as the basis for treatment of pediatric eye disease."

Recent studies have highlighted the vital role of nerves infiltrating the tumor microenvironment (TME) in
tumorigenesis and caner progression. The current research in this field is largely focused on the impact of
dysfunctions of autonomic nervous system or psychological stress-induced hormone network on the malignant
progression of cancer. The potential regulation of peripheral nerve system by immune cells in the TME, which
subsequently influences tumorigenesis, has not been extensively studied. The overall goal of this proposal is to
define how a specific Treg subset, called follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells, modulates the TME to promote cancer
by producing and utilizing a neurotrophic factor, which is an unexplored area in the field of cancer research. We
have recently reported the pro-tumoral activity of TFR cells, which depends on the expression of the transcription
factor Blimp1 (encoded by Prdm1). Further analysis revealed that higher tumoral TFR signatures along with
PRDM1 expression indicated increased malignancy and risk of metastasis in many cancers. Moreover,
intratumoral TFR cells compared to conventional Treg cells and their peripheral counterparts expressed higher
levels of neuritin (encoded by Nrn1), a neurotrophic factor implicated in tumorigenesis, while its mechanistic
action remains largely unclear. Notably, TFR signature and PRDM1 positively correlated with NRN1 expression
in cancer patients. Intratumoral TFR cells in mice with disrupted TFR suppression due to Foxp3-specific deletion
of Blimp1 had substantially reduced expression of neuritin. Most importantly, tumors from these mice and mice
lacking TFR cells had markedly reduced neurofilament accumulation compared to wild-type tumors, and
intratumoral TFR cells were enriched with gene signatures implicated in axonogenesis. We propose to define the
mechanisms by which TFR cells exploit the Blimp1-neuritin axis to regulate the TME and tumor progression, and
to define the capacity of TFR-derived neuritin in promoting axonogenesis in the tumor. Findings obtained here will
revolutionize our understanding of the tumor innervation and immunosuppressive TME, aiding in developing new
immunotherapeutic approaches to treat cancer."
10845574,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age-dependent macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss. Late stage AMD is divided into
two types, neovascular or exudative (wet) and atrophic (dry). Wet AMD is increasingly recognized as a group of
diseases with differential presentations in patients of different ethnic backgrounds. In patients of European
ancestry, it is typically characterized by large drusen and progression to choroidal neovascularization caused by
excessive production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is central to disease progression. Wet
AMD is therefore treated with intravitreal VEGF inhibitors which have transformed disease prognosis. However,
in patients of Asian or African ancestry exudative AMD is most associated with a paucity of drusen and polypoidal
choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), a member of the pachychoroid disease spectrum. Despite the prevalence of PCV,
this disease remains poorly understood and anti-VEGF therapy is often less effective for these eyes than for
those with typical neovascular AMD, leaving a critical need for new therapeutic targets and treatments
specifically targeted at this disease. Pachychoroid diseases are characterized by the formation of dilated
“pachyvessels” which originate from the choroid and are accompanied by aneurysmal polyps in PCV. Recent
genetic studies have linked members of the angiopoietin (Angpt)-TEK endothelial signaling system with PCV
and central serous chorioretinopathy, another member of the pachychoroid spectrum. Directly testing this
association, we discovered that neural crest specific Angpt1 knockout mice exhibit choriocapillaris attenuation
and encroachment of dilated pachyvessels characteristic of pachychoroid and PCV, representing a new genetic
model of these poorly understood diseases and a key tool for understanding the role of angiopoietin signaling in
disease progression and as a therapeutic target. To further characterize ANGPT1 signaling in the choroidal
vasculature, we performed preliminary single cell transcriptomics analysis which revealed that ANGPT1 is
essential for maintenance of the differentiated choriocapillaris phenotype. Angpt1 knockout mice exhibited
markedly reduced expression of key choriocapillaris functional genes, including the VEGF receptor encoded by
Kdr. In contrast, Kdr expression was elevated in other vascular beds, providing a potential mechanism by which
ANGPT1 deficiency leads to choriocapillaris dysfunction and pachyvessel formation through dilation of choroidal
vessels. In this proposal, we will leverage these findings and our new mouse model to (1) fully characterize the
role of angiopoietin signaling in the choriocapillaris and identify unique markers differentiating pachyvessels from
the healthy choroid, (2) Understand the respective role(s) of choriocapillaris dysfunction and direct ANGPT1
signaling in pachyvessel formation and (3) investigate the potential of a new ANGPT1 mimetic drug as a targeted
therapeutic in pachychoroid diseases including PCV. The results of these studies will provide new therapeutic
targets and characterize a potential lead compound for treatment of this understudied group of diseases."

Dysfunction of the striated external urethral sphincter is the strongest predictor of stress urinary incontinence,
defined as involuntary loss of urine due to increased intraabdominal pressure in the absence of bladder
contraction. Stress urinary incontinence affects approximately 1 in 2 women at some point in their lives. The
primary inciting event behind the development of chronic stress urinary incontinence has been unequivocally
identified as injury to the urinary continence mechanism sustained by women during vaginal deliveries. This
astoundingly prevalent condition dramatically decreases quality of life, causes significant morbidity, and is
associated with large economic burden to the individuals and society. Despite this, preventative strategies are
almost non-existent, and the available treatments are delayed and compensatory as they do not directly target
the underlying pathophysiology. The above is largely due to the fact that our understanding of the pathways that
lead to failure of the intrinsic muscular components of the external urethral sphincter following birth injury remains
limited. Furthermore, the prevailing preclinical studies do not utilize biologically relevant pregnant animal model
of birth injury. To address the existing unmet clinical need and knowledge gaps, we assembled a cross-
disciplinary team with diverse but complimentary expertise to execute the current project at the interface between
basic science, biomaterial development, and translational medicine. We will use a validated and biologically
relevant pregnant pre-clinical model to investigate structural, molecular, and cellular events at multiple time
points across a recovery continuum of the striated external urethral sphincter following birth injury. These basic
processes will inform the development of and the critical time to deliver new, minimally invasive tissue-
engineered therapy for the prevention and treatment of urethral muscle dysfunction. Specifically, we will test a
novel pro-regenerative skeletal muscle-specific injectable extracellular matrix hydrogel, derived from
decellularized porcine skeletal muscles, in preventing and reversing maladaptive recovery of the external urethral
sphincter following birth injury. Collectively, this innovative study will provide fundamental knowledge of the
biological processes involved in the regulation of external urethral sphincter muscle regeneration, and

 Obesity is a significant and growing problem in the United States. Currently, 68.5% of the U.S. population is
overweight, with approximately 37.7% of the overweight population being obese. The significant health problems
associated with overweightedness and obesity, the “body habitus” of this population combined with the significant
challenges in medical imaging of these individuals reduces the effectiveness of healthcare for this population. In
ultrasound imaging, the quality of abdominal ultrasound exams are significantly affected by obesity.
 Fundamentally, an ultrasound image relies on acoustic propagation to a target, reflection, and then
propagation back to the surface. The process of beamforming, which converts the surface measurement to an
image, is sensitive to the low amplitude reflections from different tissue layers and tissue properties. Typically,
the additional fat and connective tissue layers in obese patients can significantly degrade ultrasound image
quality by introducing multi-path reverberation and phase aberration that obscure or distort these low amplitude
reflections.
 However, due to the computational complexity of describing ultrasound propagation and reflection in
heterogeneous media, beamformers currently rely on simplified models that do not describe the propagation
physics directly. We propose a generational leap in how we approach ultrasound beamforming by using
physically and anatomically realistic wave propagation models and measurements that can effectively harness
the power of data-driven and rapidly evolving machine learning beamformers. A custom highly realistic simulation
tool that we have developed will use acoustical maps of the fine structures in the human body based on
photographic cryosections. This physics-based approach will allow us to develop high quality training data and
to understand the physical mechanisms for image quality improvement. These simulations will be calibrated to
ex vivo and in vivo human data to subsequently generate a large data set that can be used to train a machine-
learning-based real-time beamformer. We will focus on two sources of image degradation which we have
identified to be particularly deleterious: multipath reverberation and aberration of the focusing profile. The
proposed neural network beamformer filters incoherent noise, such as multi-path reverberation, and corrects
aberration in the radiofrequency channel signals.
 After training the beamformer and implementing it in real-time, a pilot human study in liver ultrasound imaging
will be conducted to determine the improvement in image quality in high-body-mass index individuals, where
diagnostic imaging is problematic due to image degradation. This technique is highly translatable to other clinical
scenarios, varying from cardiac to transcranial to obstetric imaging, by changing the anatomical model.
Furthermore, the physical concepts that will be extracted from the learned representation, can be used to improve
the design process for ultrasound equipment, including transmit sequences, and transducers."
10806211,"Genome instability refers to changes in chromosome sequence, structure, or number that affect
normal cell function. Such instability is characteristic of cancer, as well as certain developmental and
neurological defects, and aging. Data from multiple organisms suggests that DNA replication stress is a
key contributor to genome instability. Mechanisms that stabilize replication forks, prevent abnormal
divisions, and promote DNA repair are a primary barrier to disease; therefore, understanding their
function and the consequences of their disruption has direct relevance to human health.
 This proposal employs an established model cell biology system, the fission yeast S. pombe,
to characterize how living cells respond to replication stress. S. pombe is a well-established genetic
model for chromosome biology that shares many features with human cells. Significantly, nearly all the
genes under study have orthologues in humans that have been associated with disease..
 A key aspect of the approach is to use live cell imaging to characterize the response to
replication stress and characterize its long term consequences. The overarching goal is to understand
the dynamics of replication stress and its resolution in normal and mutant cells. This includes
determining how the cell deploys molecular mechanisms to allow damage resolution and ensure
chromosome segregations. We address the cellular and genetic consequences of division under
stress; investigate how replication occurs late in G2 or mitosis to facilitate resolution; and examine the
three-dimensional organization of repair structures. We have previously shown that the pericentromere
is a fragile site, and we have expanded that to examine the ribosomal DNA and the role of phase
separation in contributing to gene integrity, as well as identification of other fragile regions. A novel
component is the analysis of replication stress during meiosis as a contributor to chromosome
rearrangements associated with birth defects and infertility.
 By combining this cell biological approach with superb yeast gene-discovery tools, and
identifying the molecular events that lead to abnormal divisions and further stress, this project tackles a
critical gap in current understanding. What are the pathways that contribute to different responses to
stress and their associated pathologies and how do they affect the biology of living cells? Together,
these studies provide a holistic picture of how conserved proteins interact to maintain genome stability
in a eukaryotic cell, identifying markers and risk factors for human disease.

10808203,"Summary.
The tens of thousands of microbial metabolites produced by the trillions of bacterial cells that colonize our
intestines (our microbiota) are poorly understood, and current estimates suggest that we only know the biological
functions of 0.1% of all small molecules derived from the microbiota. Some of the metabolites in this so called
“dark matter” of the metabolome will undoubtedly have profound impacts on human physiology. Here, we will
establish how the human microbiome “communicates” with the host via dark-matter-derived molecular
modulation of host G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including GPCR signaling effects mediated by
novel small molecules encoded by the microbiota (Aim 1a), GPCR signaling effects derived from endogenous
host chemicals (Aim 1b), and gut bacterial transformations of GPCR-targeted medical drugs that rewire chemical
signaling programs at the host-microbiota interface (Aim 2). A major focus will be the structural, functional, and
biosynthetic characterization of novel metabolites associated with “orphan” GPCR signaling where only limited
chemical and biological information is currently available. Our proposal takes advantage of the results from two
high-throughput screens and one targeted screen, which each focused on different aspects of how microbial
or host metabolism impacts host GPCR signaling at a detailed molecular level. In preliminary high-throughput
studies: 1) We have analyzed ~150 diverse human gut bacteria for secretion of metabolites that activate
conventional GPCRs (314 GPCRs) using a high-throughput GPCR screening system (Aim 1a). We have
characterized bacterial metabolites identified by this screen that activate three orphan GPCRs to date and have
thus established a pipeline for “GPCR deorphanization.” 2) We have screened human tissues for small molecules
that activate “orphan” GPCRs with no reported ligand information available (Aim 1b), providing a basis to
elucidate the structure and distribution of endogenous orphan GPCR signals. 3) We have evaluated the
processing of 271 FDA-approved drugs (including 62 GPCR-targeted drugs) by a panel of dozens of gut
microbiota-derived bacteria. This preliminary data includes 585,000 drug-by-microbiota measurements. Many
drug metabolism products and bacterial responses to drugs can be observed in the metabolomics data, guiding
the discovery of novel GPCR drug transformations and “specialized” metabolites from the gut microbiota whose
production is induced in response to GPCR drugs (Aim 2). The proposed studies will represent a heretofore
unprecedented structure-function-based exploration of the “dark matter” of the microbiota metabolome and how
it is “sensed” by the host. Such studies may illuminate novel GPCR- and microbiota-targeted therapeutic
strategies for a diversity of human diseases."
10824265,"The proposed K08 Career Development Award will provide Dr. Knettel with the training and mentorship to
become an independent clinical scientist focused on developing novel, yet scalable mental health interventions
in resource-limited settings. The objective of the proposed research is to assess the feasibility and acceptability
of a 3-session, nurse-delivered telehealth intervention to reduce suicidality and improve HIV care engagement
among adults living with HIV in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. Suicide is a leading cause of death among
people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide and mental health disorders are key contributors to poor HIV care
engagement, lower quality of life, higher transmission risk, and increased mortality among PLWH. Conversely,
connecting PLWH with targeted mental health support improves these critical health outcomes. Telehealth
counseling represents a cost-effective, innovative approach to mental health treatment in low-resource settings
such as Tanzania, with the potential to `leapfrog' less efficient approaches and expediently extend services. Dr.
Knettel is a Licensed Psychologist with a strong background as a clinician and researcher in mental health and
HIV, including extensive experience in Tanzania. This K08 award will support him to achieve the following
training objectives: 1) acquire expertise in clinical models to address suicidal ideation among PLWH; 2) obtain
independent investigator-level skills in the development and evaluation of mental health interventions via
clinical trial research; 3) develop the capacity to lead translational research in resource-limited settings; and 4)
gain proficiency in telehealth treatment and adaptation of interventions for telehealth delivery. To support these
objectives, Dr. Knettel proposes a mentoring team led by Dr. David Goldston, a leading clinician-scientist in the
area of suicide prevention; Co-Mentor Dr. Blandina Mmbaga will guide training in translational HIV research in
Tanzania; Co-Mentor Dr. Michael Relf is an expert in clinical trials for HIV care engagement; and Co-Mentor
Dr. Sylvia Kaaya is a Tanzanian psychiatrist specializing in the adaptation of behavioral interventions. Expert
consultants Drs. Ryan Shaw and Elizabeth Turner offer further mentorship in telehealth and clinical trial
biostatistics. Training objectives will be met through a comprehensive training plan involving in-person
mentorship, coursework, seminars, lab meetings, and collaboration at the international research site. The
proposed study will include Aim 1: Identifying the desired characteristics of a telehealth intervention for
suicidality and HIV care engagement in the Tanzanian clinical context, Aim 2: Refining intervention content
with support from a local study advisory board in Tanzania, and Aim 3: Testing the telehealth model in a pilot
randomized control trial. Given emerging evidence for telehealth approaches to improve access to treatment
and reduce health disparities, the intervention has great potential to support NIMH strategic objectives to
address mental health comorbidities and strengthen the HIV care continuum. The proposed study will also
provide preliminary data for Dr. Knettel's first R01 proposal, to be submitted in the final year of this K08 award."
10767978,"Stimulant drug (e.g., crystal methamphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy, MDMA) use is a substantial public
health problem among young gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (YGBMSM) in the United
States (US). Stimulant use is associated with increased engagement in sexual risk behaviors and decreased
use of HIV prevention and treatment services, and as such leads to increased HIV acquisition/transmission.
There are currently no evidence-based interventions to reduce stimulant use and concurrent HIV risk among
YGBMSM; in response to this urgent need and building of over a decade of NIH-funded formative and pilot
research, the proposed hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial is designed to assess the
effectiveness and implementation strategies of Project IMPACT—a HIV status neutral, modular behavioral
intervention to reduce HIV risk in YGBMSM who use stimulants in the context of high-risk sex. The
intervention incorporates HIV risk reduction counseling (including supporting PrEP and ART use) with
behavioral activation (BA)—an evidence-based, easy to administer, cognitive behavioral approach to treat
depression that focuses on helping individuals re-engage in activities that generate feelings of enjoyment.
 Our conceptual model posits that BA will re-engage YGBMSM in pleasurable non-drug use activities
that will serve as a natural reinforcement for functional behavior, improve depressed mood when not on
stimulants by experiencing increases in pleasure, and decrease overall distress so that YGBMSM who use
stimulants can better benefit from HIV risk reduction counseling. The initial pilot trials of Project IMPACT
resulted in significant reductions in sexual risk, stimulant use and depressive symptoms.
 Research Plan Overview: By harnessing the resources, geographic and site diversity, and
multidisciplinary expertise of the Adolescent Trials Network (ATN), the current proposal aims to efficiently and
rigorously prepare Project IMPACT for rapid translation into real-world practice. Following the RE-AIM
Framework, we will test the reach and effectiveness of Project IMPACT (compared to an enhanced Standard
of Care condition) in a two-arm, multi-site and multi-format (i.e., in-person and virtual) randomized controlled
trial of 360 cisgender YGBMSM who use stimulants in the context of high-risk sex. Participants will be
followed for 12 months, and primary outcomes include number of condomless anal sex acts while not
protected by PrEP (HIV- YGBMSM) or while not virally suppressed (HIV+ YGBMSM) and stimulant use (via
urinalysis). We will also test our multi-faceted implementation strategy by assessing adoption/ accessibility
and implementation using mixed-methods assessments that describe and examine characteristics of
successful implementation (including differences by intervention delivery format). Finally, we will assess the
feasibility of maintenance and sustainment of Project IMPACT by using the well-established CEPAC-AYA
model to project its cost effectiveness on HIV transmissions, QALYs, and per person lifetime costs."

As a mature research network, the ATN is well-poised to assemble innovative and experienced scholars,
providers and community partners that can deliver prevention and treatment technologies in the right
combinations at the right time and place for those who could benefit most. A strong Statistical and Data
Management Core (SDMC) is central to the successful planning, implementation, analysis, dissemination, and
stewardship of all ATN research projects, cross-network analyses, and contributions to the field of adolescent
and young adult HIV prevention and care. To provide SDMC services for this ATN funding cycle, we assembled
a leadership team from the University of North Carolina, Emmes, and Harvard University/Mass General. The
SDMC will provide comprehensive data management and analyses for all network clinical studies; leadership;
and services for regulatory aspects, biostatistics, study design, analysis, interpretation, and publication of results.
The SDMC will use innovative statistical methods and state-of-the-art clinical trial management systems and
laboratory information management systems to ensure complete, high-quality data. SDMC leaders are uniformly
committed to improving HIV prevention and care outcomes through excellence in evidence-based interventional
research. Our Core will provide scientific and analytic expertise, comprehensive data management and data
stewardship resources, and coordination, and supervision to the ATN and its individual and cross-network
protocols, as well as to the broader scientific and ATN stakeholder communities. The SDMC is responsible for
the integrity of study design, quality of data management and rigor and reproducibility of analyses for all clinical
studies proposed in this application and future emerging scientific priorities during this ATN project cycle. We
will ensure that all ATN studies meet data access and security protocols defined by institutional ethical review
requirements, federal regulatory standards, and applicable international guidelines. In addition, the SDMC will
lead efforts to standardize and harmonize data management and statistical activities within the ATN and in line
with other NIH-sponsored programs. Throughout the lifetime of an individual study, the SDMC will coordinate
services and systems for the clinical and laboratory data collection and management required to support the
research projects and the overall ATN research agenda. Across these activities, the SDMC will intentionally
promote more equitable use, accessibility, and dissemination of data through mentorship and involvement of
trainees, early-stage investigators, and under-represented minorities in SDMC activities. We have assembled a
diverse team with complementary leadership experience and expertise in statistical analyses, epidemiology of
HIV, statistical modeling and cost analysis, adolescent and young adult HIV intervention development and
evaluation, evidence-based clinical care, network science and multi-site, multi-study biomedical and behavioral
clinical trials. Our SDMC leadership model and collective expertise will provide the high-quality study design,
data systems and management, and data stewardship to generate impactful science to reduce adolescent HIV."
10794324,"My objective for the K25 award is to establish myself as an independent neuroimaging statistician, with
expertise in whole-brain network analyses and an integral member of multidisciplinary research teams devoted
to addressing diseases of the brain. Attaining these goals will require didactic training and research guidance.
Research
We will develop new methodology to improve whole-brain dynamic connectivity analyses of normal and
abnormal brain function, which is vital for understanding various brain disorders, such as Alzheimer’s Disease,
and may help identify biomarkers and inform early prevention and treatment. Previous studies are largely
based on one average network constructed using data from an entire brain scan (i.e., static connectivity), but
emerging evidence suggests network topology exhibits meaningful variations on the second to minute scale,
creating a gap in understanding unless these variations are quantified. While several methods have been
proposed to address this new direction in the field, there does not yet exist a unifying framework that
accurately estimates whole-brain networks, as well as the dynamics of network change across a functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, while a) accounting for variables of interest and motion-
induced artifacts and b) allowing for individual estimates of dynamics. The novel methods proposed here will
address these needs and provide a set of tools for future dynamic brain network analysis research. This
research, along with my proposed training plan, will facilitate my progression toward becoming an independent
neuroimaging statistician with expertise in brain network analysis.
Training
The proposed training program involves four components: 1) career guidance and neuroscience and network
analysis training from a mentoring committee; 2) an educational component to establish fundamental
knowledge in computational neuroscience and image analysis; 3) performing innovative research using the
skills gained from the proposed training plan and; 4) participating in the exchange of knowledge and ideas with
other statisticians and neuroscientists through workshops, conferences, seminar series, and journal clubs. The
training will enable me to shift from an early career statistician to an established, independent, neuroimaging
statistician with expertise in whole-brain network analyses. The training in computational neuroscience and
image analysis will allow me to become a multidisciplinary research team scientist dedicated to studying the
human brain. The growth gained through this 5-year period will lead to a skill set, and a confidence, that allows
me to be more well-versed in the neuroscience and biology behind the data I am analyzing. This will ultimately
lead to more effective communication with neuroscientists and clinicians, improved study design, more
informed statistical analyses, and a more comprehensive interpretation of the results in my future work."
10738782,"BACKGROUND: Despite work by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to implement a package of suicide
prevention strategies, suicide remains an ongoing problem among Veterans, particularly during the three
months following psychiatric hospitalization. [Current evidence suggests that some of the most important
contributing factors to post-hospitalization suicide risk include poor social connectedness and engagement in
care in the post-discharge period. In response, we developed a promising suicide prevention strategy called
Prevention of suicide: Education, Awareness, Connection, and Engagement (PEACE), which combines a
mobile health (mHealth) technology with a manual-based intervention to increase connectedness and
engagement in care. Our pilot data suggest that a manual-based approach to improving engagement in care
holds great promise in mitigating suicide risk, but could be further enhanced through the addition of a mHealth
strategy to increase social connectedness. Therefore, the next appropriate step is to perform a clinical trial in
order to clarify whether combining these two approaches together is an effective suicide prevention strategy.]
OBJECTIVES: The long-term goal is for the candidate, Dr. Natalie Riblet, to become an independent clinical
researcher focused on developing, testing, and improving interventions to prevent suicide. Her overall
objective for this five-year career development program is to gain the education, mentorship, and research
experience needed to launch her independent clinical research career. Her short-term goal is to obtain the
necessary skills in: [(1) designing and adapting clinical interventions; (2) designing, conducting, and managing
clinical trials]; and (3) performing clinical research in patients at high risk for suicide. Her research objectives
align with these goals. Dr. Riblet’s proposed research project tests the efficacy of [PEACE] in decreasing
suicide risk following psychiatric hospitalization. Her central hypothesis is that [PEACE] plus standard
psychiatric hospital discharge care [(TAU)] leads to a greater reduction in suicidal ideation after psychiatric
hospitalization compared to [TAU] alone. A secondary hypothesis is that [PEACE] exerts its anti-suicidal effect
by [improving social connectedness and engagement in care.] She will submit a merit award proposal in the
last two years of the award period. If the results of this proposal are positive, Dr. Riblet’s merit award proposal
will focus on conducting a multi-site trial of [PEACE], making further improvements to [PEACE], and/or
developing an alternative intervention that better addresses suicide risk.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of [PEACE] will be carried out in Veterans who are psychiatrically
hospitalized at the [White River Junction VA Medical Center.] Eligible patients will be recruited over a period of
four years and will be randomized to [PEACE plus TAU or TAU alone.] Patients will be followed for a period of
six months. Outcome data will be collected at baseline and at one-, three-, and six-month follow-up time
points. A generalized linear mixed model will be used to determine whether [PEACE] leads to significant
improvements in suicidal ideation. A structural equation model will be used to determine whether social
connectedness and engagement in care moderates the effect of [PEACE] on suicidal ideation. An exploratory
analysis will be conducted using time-to-event analysis to determine the effect of [PEACE] on suicide attempts.
IMPACT: The goal of the proposed career development award is to help Dr. Riblet become an independent
clinical researcher in the field of suicide prevention. This five-year award will consist of educational, research,
and mentorship components. The education components will provide Dr. Riblet with additional skills to
become skilled in conducting clinical research in Veterans at high risk for suicide. The research components
will equip Dr. Riblet with tangible skills in conducting a clinical trial of a suicide prevention strategy and these
data will be used to inform a future merit award. Dr. Riblet will also benefit from expert mentorship from
leaders in suicide prevention and clinical research."
10757641,"SUMMARY
In many species, spinal cord regeneration is driven by the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor
cells (NPCs), but therapeutic efforts to promote regeneration in human patients through engraftment of neural
stem cells or progenitor cells have had limited success. These limitations arise in part because the cell-intrinsic
properties of NPCs and neurons that enable natural regeneration are still largely undefined, as are the spatial
cues that confer positional identity on these cells in a regenerative context. Tadpoles of the frog Xenopus
tropicalis can respond to major spinal cord injury with scarless healing and regeneration, a capability that is lost
as the tadpole completes metamorphosis. This stage-specific regenerative competence represents a uniquely
sensitive system in which to define the transcriptional regulatory profile of NPCs and neurons that support
regeneration, and the incremental changes in all spinal cord cells that contribute to regenerative loss. In this
project, we will test the central hypothesis that regenerative competence is dictated by the ability of NPCs to
respond to injury by transcriptionally activating spatiotemporally distinct programs of proliferation or neuronal
subtype differentiation. Our project examines this hypothesis from three standpoints. First, we will ask how the
spatial organization of the spinal cord, and specifically NPC domains, is re-established after injury, explicitly
asking whether embryonic patterning cues along the dorsal-ventral axis are recapitulated. Second, we will
define the functions of two new transcriptional regulators of spinal cord regeneration that we have identified,
Pbx3 and Meis1, identifying the gene targets, sensitive cell types, and protein interactions of these two TALE
box transcription factors contrast between embryonic development and regeneration. Finally, we will test
specific hypotheses for how regeneration fails by contrasting the cell intrinsic changes in NPCs and neurons
that occur in response to injury in regenerative versus non-regenerative stages. By completing this project we
will fundamentally advance our understanding of how regeneration is achieved and how it is lost in this closely-
related vertebrate, opening the door for new therapeutic strategies informed by this naturally occurring model
of regeneration."
10788419,"ABSTRACT. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from complex interactions between over 150 independent loci
imparting disease susceptibility and environmental factors that break immune tolerance, leading to the immune-
mediated destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic -cells. Among these exists a small number of coding
variants, which may represent rational therapeutic targets to restore immune tolerance, yet the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which risk variants alter immune function remain poorly characterized. The CD226
candidate gene contains a protein coding variant (rs763361) linked to multiple autoimmune disorders, including
T1D. CD226 functions as a costimulatory molecule that competes with the negative regulators, TIGIT and CD96,
for binding to CD155 or CD112 expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs). Our published and preliminary
data, supported by the initial phase of this R01, suggest that CD226 signaling destabilizes the regulatory T cell
(Treg) phenotype. Specifically, genetic deletion of Cd226 attenuated disease development in the non-obese
diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D, both in genomic knockout (gKO) and Treg-specific conditional KO (cKO)
lines, with reduced ex-Treg frequency in the pancreatic lymph nodes (pLN) of gKO animals. Moreover, CD226–
human Tregs display increased purity, stability, and suppressive function. Single-cell transcriptional profiling and
flow cytometric analysis of tissue-resident T cells isolated from T1D organ donor pancreas and pLN identified an
imbalance of CD226 and TIGIT expression on CD8+ T cells. We hypothesize that the T1D-associated risk
variant in CD226 results in immune checkpoint dysregulation that leads to defects in peripheral immune
tolerance, specifically resulting in Treg instability prior to T1D onset. To test this, we propose three Specific Aims.
1) We will perform single cell multi-omic profiling and adoptive transfer studies to identify the cellular and
molecular basis by which CD226 contributes to defective immune tolerance in the NOD mouse, using our Cd226
gKO and Treg cKO strains. 2) We will assess the expression profile and functional impact of the CD226 risk
variant using banked organ donor tissues and human peripheral blood samples derived from individuals with
and at risk for T1D. These efforts will involve in situ profiling of genotype-selected pancreas and pLN samples
via spatial transcriptomics and high-content imaging, along with CRISPR/cas9 gene-editing of CD226 in primary
cells with T cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer to generate isogenic, autoreactive Treg, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells
for in vitro functional studies. 3) We will test candidate therapeutics targeting the CD226 costimulatory axis in
vivo using NOD mice and in vitro using human cells. Hence, the proposed studies will employ novel animal
strains along with gene editing and TCR gene transfer techniques in human lymphocytes, which we pioneered
over the prior grant term, to inform on the contributions of the CD226/TIGIT/CD96:CD155/CD112 immune
checkpoint to T1D development, with the potential for translatable interventions blocking CD226 co-stimulation
to halt the immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic -cells."

Leukemia is the most common childhood cancer and represents approximately one third of all cancer diagnoses
among children age 0-14. There is strong evidence that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common
type of leukemia in children, is initiated in utero. The ETV6/RUNX1 gene fusion, which is considered an early
initiating event in the development of ALL, is present at birth in some children who later develop ALL. Children
born with these leukemia-specific translocation in blood cells have pre-leukemia, and there is a need to define
the epidemiology of pre-leukemia and identify the factors that contribute to pre-leukemia persistence and
progression to ALL. We have developed a robust new method for detection of ETV6/RUNX1 pre-leukemia which
uses newborn blood spots. We propose to use this method to: 1) examine the newborn blood spots of 500
children who later developed leukemia and from 3000 healthy children who did not develop leukemia to identify
the determinants of pre-leukemia at birth; 2) estimate the risk of childhood ALL given pre-leukemia at birth; and
3) evaluate how long pre-leukemia persists in childhood using both newborn blood spots and, from the same
cohort of children, blood samples collected over time within early childhood. Together, these goals will allow us
to determine how many children with ALL are born with the leukemia gene fusion; what factors predict pre-
leukemia at birth; how many children who never develop leukemia are born with the gene fusion; and how long
the gene fusion persists in childhood.
Establishing the true population prevalence and determinants of ETV6/RUNX1 gene fusion at birth is an essential
first step in reducing the burden of childhood ALL. Further, this project will be the first of its kind to monitor the
persistence of pre-leukemia in early childhood. The proposal is an exceptional opportunity to understand
childhood pre-leukemia, is robust in design using three independent studies, and leverages existing NIH
investment in pediatric epidemiology. Successful completion of the project will foster epidemiologic innovation
including cohort studies of infants at high risk for ALL, allowing us to fill significant gaps in our understanding of
the most common childhood cancer. Importantly, the work has the potential to translate into clinical monitoring
of ALL in high-risk populations."

The primary objective of the Molecular and Environmental Toxicology Summer Research Opportunities
Program (MET-SROP) is to accelerate the educational pipeline of underrepresented students and train the
next generation of researchers in the environmental health sciences. The overarching idea of the MET-SROP
is that by providing an opportunity to experience a significant environmental toxicology laboratory research
project with strong mentorship and employ modern technologies to understand cellular and molecular
mechanisms of toxicity, we can bring down the barriers that prevent many young scientists from choosing
such a career path and simultaneously enhance their likelihood of success. Building on over ten years of
success, the program aims to support seven undergraduate trainees from underrepresented backgrounds
each summer and provide research experiences that reflect modern approaches to understand cellular and
molecular mechanisms of toxicity. Unique program elements include: i) rigorous hands-on training in basic
laboratory research coupled with ii) introduction to a didactic foundation of environmental health sciences,
and iii) diverse exposures to future career opportunities and tools for successful advancement beyond
undergraduate training. Housed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Campus, trainers are experts in
foundations of toxicology, molecular approaches to chemical toxicity, genetics, data sciences, and
epidemiology. Trainees receive extensive laboratory experience working alongside graduate students and
fellows. This laboratory training is combined with a ten-week program including didactic training, career
development and mentoring. The parallel “Didactic” track program will begin with an interactive overview of
toxicology and its relevance to other environmental health sciences including environmental regulation, risk
assessment, epidemiology, community health and health equity. This foundation is essential for supporting
student success in lab work and the ability to see the impact of research beyond the laboratory. The didactic
session also includes a three-week minicourse in data science including training in R-programming for
analyzing toxicology and human health data. The third SROP component, referred to as “Science Life,”
includes several minisymposia throughout the ten weeks that include laboratory tours, and talks by leading
experts from UW Madison, and former trainees known in the environmental health sciences workforce, from
both government and industry. Finally, SROP trainees participate in a variety of campus events to interact
with and build connections with other summer program trainees from diverse backgrounds. This networking is
also complemented by numerous opportunities to engage with other graduate students and alumni through
the didactic and science life tracks. Since its inception, the MET-SROP aims to welcome and support
students from communities traditionally underrepresented in STEM and provides them with a rewarding
summer experience from which to advance their environmental health sciences career."

All animals need to detect threats in their environment to survive. Objects on a collision course cast expanding
shadows on the retina (i.e., looming) that elicit innate defensive responses from insects to humans. During the
previous award of this grant, we discovered that a retinal interneuron, the VGLUT3-expressing amacrine cell
(VG3-AC), detects looming and drives innate defensive responses in mice. Here, we follow up on this discovery
to understand how dendritic processing gives rise to feature-selective responses of VG3-ACs (Aim 1), and how
VG3-ACs use dual transmitters (glutamate and glycine) to generate divergent feature representations
downstream and guide behavior (Aim 2). Dendritic processing and dual transmission are features of subcellular
modularity, which we propose as an organizing principle of interneurons. To explore subcellular modularity, we
developed methods to combine two-photon calcium imaging and serial-section electron microscopy in the same
tissue (i.e., functional connectomics). In Aim 1, we will combine functional connectomics with computational
modeling and cell-type-specific genetic manipulations to test the hypotheses that synaptic inhibition and arbor
morphology compartmentalize VG3-AC dendrites and that dendritic compartmentalization generates looming-
selective responses. In Aim 2, we combine functional connectomics, optogenetics, and cell-type-specific genetic
manipulations, to test the hypotheses that VG3-ACs use glutamate and glycine to communicate their responses
with opposite sign to two categories of ganglion cells and that this target-specific use of dual transmitters
generates divergent representations of looming in the retinal output. We know little about how retinal processing
relates to visual processing in the brain and behavior. To fill this gap in our knowledge, we have established
projection-specific large-scale recordings from retinal ganglion cells, large-scale recordings from subcortical
ganglion cell targets, and behavioral assays. This allows us to track how looming signals of VG3-AC dendrites
are transformed across subsequent stages of processing to guide behavior. In Aim 1, we will test the hypotheses
that downstream neurons lose their feature selectivity and that innate defensive responses generalize to non-
threatening stimuli when dendritic processing of VG3-ACs is disrupted (i.e., when local processing becomes
global). In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that VG3-ACs use glutamate and glycine to generate impressed-
and suppressed-by-looming responses in two categories of ganglion cells and that these ganglion cells converge
in the superior colliculus to drive defensive behaviors and control the contrast gain of these responses,
respectively. Together, our studies will provide insights into the specifics and general principles of interneuron
organization, mechanisms, and functions and bridge that gap in our understanding from retinal processing to
visual processing in the brain and behavior for a conserved retinal interneuron and its downstream pathways

Following peripheral nerve injury (PNI), sensory and motoneuron (MN) axons degenerate distal to the injury site
but both maintain the ability to regenerate and reinnervate their muscle targets. Motoneurons regain the ability
to produce muscle force and the majority of the muscle afferents (“propriosensors”) reinnervate the muscle
spindles and fire in response to muscle stretch. However, regardless of successful peripheral regeneration,
patients who experience PNI continue to suffer from life-long motor complications such as limb inter-joint
discoordination and muscle co-contraction. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that plasticity in the
connectivity of pre-motor spinal circuits following nerve injury results in permanent motor deficits.
Specific Aim 1 (K99), hypothesis: hyper-excitatory drive to the spinal pre-motor interneurons following nerve
transection promotes muscle co-contraction. Proprioceptor Ia afferent axons that synapse on spinal MNs are
permanently degraded in lamina IX following nerve cut resulting in the loss of the stretch reflex. However, these
same afferents double their synapses in the deep dorsal horn, where a heterogenous population of pre-motor
interneurons reside. One specific subset of these neurons are those that express Isl1. This specific population
of neurons are glutamatergic, project to divergent motor pools, and receive propriosensor input. An imbalance
in synaptic drive to these cells could facilitate muscle co-contraction. This will be investigated using a
combinatory approach with multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) and transgenic models to identify and manipulate the
activity of the Isl1+ neurons using chemogenetics in an attempt to restore normal muscle activity following injury.
Specific Aim 2 (R00), hypothesis: nerve crush abolishes presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents and results in an
exaggerated stretch reflex force. In difference to a nerve cut, following a crush injury the stretch reflex is not only
restored it results in supra-normal levels of muscle force. One striking anatomical difference between these two
injury types is that Ia afferent synapses are restored on MNs following crush regeneration but they lose a
significant number of presynaptic inhibitory boutons (p-boutons) that gate Ia synaptic transmission. The
hypothesize of this aim is that the loss in p-boutons is responsible for the exaggerated stretch reflex response
after crush. In this aim will utilize chemogenetics to activate and/or suppress Gad2+ interneurons that provide
presynaptic inhibition during the stretch reflex to investigate how modulating the activity of these cells impact the
strength of the reflex. Then, Gad2 interneurons that provide the remaining p-boutons will be stimulated using
chemogenetics to reduces hyperreflexia after crush. Finally, electrical stimulation will be provided to the nerve
after crush to investigate if sustained activity of the afferents prevents the loss of p-boutons and restores normal
muscle force generation in response to stretch."

Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. The purpose of this K24 mid-career investigator
award is to support Dr. Thorndike’s mentorship and patient-oriented research focused on health behaviors and
social determinants of health in the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic disease. Over the past 10
years, her research in workplace and community settings has tested novel behavioral strategies to promote
healthy dietary intake and other healthy behaviors to prevent chronic disease, particularly in low-income
populations with high prevalence of food insecurity and other unmet health-related social needs. Many of these
strategies, such as traffic-light food labeling and choice architecture (product placement), have been broadly
disseminated through academic, governmental, and lay publications. Dr. Thorndike is a dedicated mentor, and
she has supported over 25 junior faculty, medical residents, postdoctoral fellows, and students. Her mentees
have written 19 first author papers (5 in process) and have received 5 NIH K23 awards (1 in review). In this
K24 application, Dr. Thorndike proposes a mentoring, career development, and research plan with inter-related
goals that will help advance the research of Dr. Thorndike and her mentees to address some of the most
intractable behavioral and social factors that contribute to cardiometabolic disease disparities. The overall
objectives of the K24 award are: 1) To enable Dr. Thorndike to dedicate 25% protected time for mentoring
early-career investigators conducting patient-oriented research focused on health behaviors and social
determinants of cardiometabolic health, 2) To have a platform for mid-career professional development and
training, in collaboration with expert collaborators and co-mentors, and 3) To integrate her existing NIH-funded
research with new research supported by this award that will support a future R01 submission. The proposed
research uses mixed methods to develop a community health worker (CHW) nutrition intervention for
community health center patients experiencing uncontrolled hypertension and food insecurity. Research Aim 1
will leverage the existing longitudinal “LiveWell” cohort of over 1,000 community health center patients (R01
DK124145, Thorndike) to conduct formative research that will inform the development of the CHW nutrition
intervention. Using the infrastructure of an existing MGH CHW hypertension program, Research Aim 2 will be a
randomized 6-month pilot study to determine feasibility and acceptability of delivering a nutrition intervention
with CHWs and to determine preliminary effectiveness of the intervention on patients’ dietary intake, blood
pressure, body mass index, and depression. Dr. Thorndike’s ongoing NIH-funded research and proposed new
research provide opportunities for mentorship in patient-oriented research focused on the development and
implementation of interventions that will improve outcomes and reduce socioeconomic disparities in
cardiometabolic health."
10844381,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI, concussion) has emerged as a risk factor for the development of
neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which are
characterized by the aberrant aggregation of tau within neural cells. However, the mechanisms linking mTBI to
tau pathology later in life remain unknown.
The glymphatic system is a recently characterized brain-wide network of perivascular spaces that supports the
rapid exchange of cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid. Glymphatic function contributes to the clearance of both
amyloid beta and tau, and its impairment is believed to underlie their deposition in the aging brain. Glymphatic
pathway function is greatest during sleep and is impaired by traumatic brain injury. Based on these findings,
we hypothesize that that impairment of glymphatic function following mTBI slows the clearance of tau and
contributes to the development of tau pathology following injury. Using a well-established model of repetitive-
blast mTBI, behavioral assessment of cognitive and functional impairment, and histological assessment of tau
pathology in a rodent model of tauopathy, we will characterize glymphatic dysfunction following blast mTBI,
and test whether its impairment promotes post-traumatic tauopathy.
Disruption of the sleep-wake cycle (SWD) is a frequent chronic complaint after mTBI. SWD also accompanies
the development of conditions like Alzheimer's disease in aging populations. More recent clinical and
translational research suggests that SWD may actually promote the development of Alzheimer's-related
pathology, including tau deposition. Based on the common clinical connections between mTBI, SWD, and
neurodegenerative disease, we hypothesize that post-traumatic SWD contributes to the development of
tauopathy following mTBI. Using parallel techniques above, we will define SWD following blast mTBI, and test
whether post-traumatic SWD promotes the development of tau pathology after injury.
In both observational clinical studies and in rodent models, post-concussive symptoms exhibit different
temporal profiles following single or repetitive mTBI. To comprehensively define the role that glymphatic
impairment and sleep disruption play in the development of tau pathology following mTBI, these studies will be
carried out in parallel in mouse models of single and repetitive blast mTBI.
The results of this study may provide a novel perspective on the mechanisms underlying the development of
post-traumatic neurodegeneration, and may support targeting glymphatic pathway function and SWD in the
prevention and treatment of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease in Veteran populations with a history of
exposure to mTBI."

The broad objective of this project is to develop federated learning approaches that can efficiently reduce
uncertainty and improve generalizability when assessing treatment effects based on multiple data sources. The
proposal is motivated by a study of the Medicaid Outcome Distributed Research Network (MODRN) of eleven
states in assessing the quality and access of medications for opioid use disorder (OUD). The collection of
Medicaid claims data accounts for 40% of the OUD population in the US and covers a wide array of treatment
choices, making it an ideal data source for understanding subgroup-specific treatment effects and developing
precision health strategies. We leverage this large-scale distributed research network (DRN) to investigate the
heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) of buprenorphine, an opioid-based medication, on overdose mortality.
However, the extra source of heterogeneity across states due to variation in state policy environments, which
is largely unobserved, has presented great challenge in the assessment of HTE. Existing approaches such as
meta-analysis are inadequate and underpowered to address the translational research needs in understanding
the complex interactions among treatments, clinical characteristics and social determinant of health, especially,
under the heavy influence of unexplainable heterogeneity across states. A suite of novel approaches will be
developed to address a wide range of analytical requests that support data-driven precision health research
under the framework of federated learning, where states collaboratively build analytical models under the
orchestration of a coordinating state without pooling individual-participant data. With a central goal of modeling
for different levels of heterogeneity in DRNs, this project focuses on the following aims: 1. To develop and
evaluate a high-precision HTE estimator for buprenorphine for Pennsylvania by incorporating modeling
information from ten other states; 2. To develop and evaluate a generalizable treatment recommendation
system that protects vulnerable populations and is robust to policy variation across states. The methods will be
rigorously tested and delivered as user friendly statistical software. The proposed methods extend well beyond
MODRN and easily find applications in other common DRNs, such as hospital data networks and mobile data
networks."

Dental caries remains among the most prevalent infectious disease worldwide, costing USA tens of billions
of dollars annually in associated care and productivity losses. Dental caries is a result of imbalance of the
indigenous microbiota on the tooth surface known as dental plaque, and the acidic metabolites of bacterial
metabolism are directly linked to the disease development. It is well understood that conditions like
continuous consumption of fermentable sugars, especially sucrose and saliva deficiency favor the
emergency of a highly acidogenic and aciduric plaque microbiota, which include Streptococcus mutans and
lactobacilli. Lactobacillus (Lb) sp. were the first implicated in dental caries over a century ago, but major
gaps remain in knowledge concerning how the different Lb sp. establish and persist in the plaque
microbiota and promote the development of carious lesions. In this study, a collection of hundreds of
different clinical Lb isolates will be examined using well established in vitro models to elucidate how major
groups of Lb sp. colonize and establish on a surface; how S. mutans and environmental conditions may
modulate the ability of major Lb sp. to establish and compete in a mixed-species consortium; and how
interactions between S. mutans and major Lb sp. influence the community dynamics under conditions
typical of the oral cavity. It is highly anticipated that the results from this study will lead to novel insights on
each of these aspects and the roles of oral Lb in plaque microbiota and dental caries. Together, the
information derived from this study should also serve as a foundation for further investigation on the
pathophysiology of oral Lb, the plaque biofilm ecology, and the development of novel strategies against
dental caries and other conditions where dysbiotic microbiota is a major underlying factor."

Chemical modifications to genomic DNA are ubiquitous across all kingdoms of life. They are diverse in nature
including methylation, hydroxymethylation, and formylation of nucleic acid residues. It is also increasingly clear
that these modifications have diverse regulatory roles. In eukaryotes, DNA modifications regulate gene expression,
RNA splicing, genome organization, and gene imprinting; these molecular functions also have important
downstream consequences for development, disease, and organismal interactions with environmental stimuli and
chemicals. Furthermore, with the advent of genome and epigenome editing technologies, these modifications can
bias the specificity and efficiency of molecular tools. Given the broad importance of DNA modifications, any
experimental tools that are able to control, measure, sense, or track them would have profound impacts across
biological disciplines. What is particularly needed, but not yet technologically possibly, is the ability to
simultaneously sense epigenetic modifications at specific genomic locations in living and single cells. This
capability would unlock a broad palette of new experimental approaches to reveal new insights into topics such as
gene imprinting, causation vs. correlation of epigenetic modifications, and cell and tissue stochasticity.
Furthermore, it would inform the development of new classes of affinity reagents for biochemical assays, disease
detection, and diagnostics and of genome and epigenome editing technologies that are aware of and specific
towards DNA modification state. To drive this new realm of studies, we will create the first molecular tool that
binds DNA hydroxymethylation at specific and programmable genomic loci, and provide a broadly applicable
platform for engineering many other similar molecular reagents."
10796840,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The long-term goal of our research is to understand virulence gene regulation in Staphylococcus aureus.
S. aureus is an important human pathogen capable of causing a wide spectrum of infections in human and
animals. The pathogenicity of this organism is dependent on various virulence factors produced during infection
that are controlled by a large number of regulators. Elucidation of virulence regulation by this complex regulatory
network is central to understanding pathogenesis of this pathogen. However, despite extensive efforts, our
knowledge of virulence regulation is still very limited. We have previously identified ClpC as part of the regulatory
network capable of regulating the transcription of a large number of genes, including virulence genes. ClpC is a
protein chaperone involved in protein quality control, which does not have a DNA-binding motif. We therefore
hypothesize that ClpC interacts with transcriptional regulators to affect gene transcription. Indeed, our recent
results provided the initial evidence to support this hypothesis. One of the regulators we identified that could
interact with ClpC is AgrA, a transcriptional regulator of the AgrAC two-component system, which is part of the
Agr quorum sensing system in S. aureus. The Agr quorum sensing system also includes AgrB and AgrD that
are involved in pheromone AIP (auto-inducing peptide) production needed for Agr autoactivation at high cell
density. Agr has been shown to be a key regulator that affects the expression of many virulence genes. Our
preliminary data showed that ClpC could activate the Agr system by directly interacting with AgrA as well as by
positively affecting AIP production independent of AgrA autoactivation, suggesting that ClpC could affect Agr
regulatory system at two different pathways. Accordingly, in this application, we propose two specific aims to
study the potential mechanisms involved in this regulation. In the first aim, we will investigate how ClpC
modulates AgrA regulatory activity. In the second aim, we will study how ClpC affects AIP production. ClpC has
been shown to negatively affect regulators by partnering with ClpP protease. However, how ClpC can positively
modulate a regulatory system is virtually unknown. Our studies proposed in this application will not only probe
the potential novel mechanisms involved in gene regulation but will also advance our understanding virulence
regulation in S. aureus."

The most common cause of vision loss among the elderly is cataract. Oxidative stress is well known to cause
cellular and tissue damage, resulting in age-associated ocular diseases, including cataract. Protein
glutathionylation, the reversible formation of a mixed-disulfide between glutathione and protein thiols, is one of
the major oxidative protein modifications in response to oxidative stress. The glutaredoxin (Grx) system repairs
protein thiols and maintains cellular redox balance. The Grx system has two isoforms, the cytosolic Grx1 (also
known as thioltransferase) and the mitochondrial Grx2. The purpose of this proposal is to study how Grx system
dysfunction may affect the lens redox signaling and its transparency. We hypothesize that Grx1/Grx2 double
deletion may increase the lens susceptibility to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and aging by inhibiting nuclear
factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidant response. We also propose that Grx-
activating compounds could protect the lens from UV-induced cataract formation. To prove our
hypotheses, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1) To identify the role of the Grx system in protecting the
lens from UV radiation and aging using the Grx1/Grx2 DKO mouse as a model. 2) To examine the crosstalk
between the Grx system and the Nrf2-antioxidant pathway. 3) To test if Grx activating compounds could protect
the lens from UV-induced cataract formation. Successful completion of these aims will introduce the Grx system
as a drug target and may lead to the development of Grx-activating compounds as a potential therapeutic for
cataract and other oxidative stress-associated eye diseases."

 The gut microbiome has repeatedly been linked to major diseases of aging, including frailty, osteoporosis,
and diabetes. However, after more than a decade of searching, there is still no consensus on which microbial
species or taxonomic features provide reliable hallmarks of aging in adults or the elderly. Different people
harbor different collections of microbes with densities and dynamics that vary considerably from one person to
the next. This personalization arises, in part, because a given microbe may perform different functions in
different people, and even in the same person at different times. This variability constrains the utility of
microbiome taxa (e.g. species, phyla, biodiversity) to measure health and healthy aging. Overcoming this
hurdle requires a shift in strategy, away from taxonomic data and towards data types that reflect the gut
microbiome’s functional capacities, including the microbial genes and metabolic pathways found in the gut
microbiome’s metagenome. Developing gut microbiome markers of healthy aging will also require prospective,
longitudinal population-based research. However, we lack prospective data sets that track longitudinal changes
in individual gut microbiome function and health outcomes across adulthood and old age.
 Our objectives in this proposal are to use a prospective, full life course, nonhuman primate model to: (i)
identify changes in the microbiome’s functional capacities across the life course; (ii) test how social and
environmental factors affect the nature and pace of microbiome aging; (iii) test how taxa-function relationships
change at different life stages; and (iv) learn which microbiome features predict physical/behavioral aging and
all-cause mortality. Our system, the well-studied Amboseli baboon population in Kenya, captures the
complexity of human behavioral and social conditions better than other animal models. We have already
profiled gut microbial taxonomic composition in 17,277 fecal samples collected over 14 years from 501
baboons. These data reveal personalized microbiome dynamics and aging trajectories that are shaped by
individual social and environmental conditions. We propose to expand this data set for 10 more years to
include 800 total individuals and analyze microbiome functional capacity in 12,000 samples. By identifying
drivers and patterns of microbiome functional aging, we will identify targets for interventions aimed at building
and sustaining healthy aging. Our results will help harness the promise of the gut microbiome to predict and
improve human health."

Asthma is a common, complex and costly pediatric chronic condition in the U.S., resulting in nearly 2 million
acute-care visits and $82 billion in overall costs each year. Children of low-income families in urban
communities have the highest prevalence of asthma and the greatest disparities in asthma morbidity and
mortality. In Hamilton County, OH, over 36,000 children have asthma, >14,000 of whom are Medicaid-
insured with a 10-fold higher rate of hospitalization. Asthma exacerbations, acute episodes of increased
asthma symptoms and deteriorations in lung function, are a major cause of stress for patients and families.
While exacerbations are a prominent feature of poorly controlled and severe asthma, exacerbation rates
can be high even in patients with mild asthma and asthma exacerbation frequency can remain unchanged
despite intensive controller therapy. Indeed, pediatric studies have revealed that exacerbations continue
to occur despite good baseline symptom control. A frequent exacerbator phenotype of asthma (defined by
2 or more exacerbations/year), has been described, but little is known about this asthma subgroup, which
disproportionately affects urban populations and is responsible for considerable asthma morbidity and
healthcare costs. No specific clinical characteristics can reliably discriminate between frequent and
nonfrequent exacerbators highlighting the need for systems level approaches. Our center-specific project
will fill this gap in understanding. Our preliminary data reveal differentially expressed and differentially
methylated genes in the nasal epithelial of children who are frequent exacerbators and highlight biologic
pathways that implicate distinct mechanisms that underlie the frequent exacerbator phenotype. We will
test the hypothesis: the frequent exacerbator is a distinct endotype of asthma that is characterized by host
nasal epithelial transcriptomic and/or DNA methylomic patterns that distinguish the frequent exacerbator
from asthmatic children who are not frequent exacerbators, and that these patterns are, in part, triggered
by distinct nasal microbial patterns. We propose an innovative strategy utilizing multiple systems-based
approaches that layer host nasal biome and methylome patterns with nasal epithelial transcriptomics taken
during an acute exacerbation (before administration of steroids). We are uniquely poised to conduct this
study due to the tremendous infrastructure that we have established as part of the Ohio Pediatric Asthma
Repository, and our multidisciplinary team. The overall objective of our studies is to improve the lives of
children with asthma from low-income families who live in urban communities. We propose to 2 aims: (1)
To contribute to the overall CAUSE goals by conducting network-wide CAUSE clinical research projects
and participating in the CAUSE Steering Committee and other network functions; (2) To conduct a center-
specific project aligned with CAUSE goals focused on the frequent exacerbator asthma phenotype."

 Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are some of the most widely studied epigenomic factors,
and alterations in histone PTM abundance / distribution have been implicated in numerous disease etiologies.
Epigenomic mapping of histone PTMs in limited cell populations or single cells (SCs) would provide the
opportunity to study the epigenetic landscape of rare and heterogenous cell populations and be highly enabling
for drug discovery research. The recent development of the antibody-mediated genomic mapping approach
CUT&Tag (Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation) permits the study of select, abundant histone PTMs
using very few cells and even SCs. Despite this progress, ultra-low input and SC CUT&Tag assays still present
a unique challenge, and have not yet been successfully applied to many challenging targets, such as less
abundant histone PTMs. Indeed, to maximize data yield per cell, ultra-low input and SC CUT&Tag assays require
antibodies to exhibit high on-target epitope binding with minimal off-target binding, which most commercial
antibodies do not offer. We envision a new class of “SC-grade” antibodies that deliver ultra-efficient histone PTM
binding for dramatically increased CUT&Tag assay sensitivity, improving reliability and providing access to new
targets that are currently intractable. Here, EpiCypher will leverage a novel antibody development pipeline to
generate ultra-efficient, “SC-grade” antibodies to unlock the potential of genomic mapping technology for next-
generation ultra-low input / SC applications. Unlike traditional antibody development pipelines that use histone
peptides for screening, a central innovation of our strategy is the implementation of recombinant modified
designer nucleosome technology during antibody development. In Phase I equivalent studies, we used our novel
approach to select and validate ultra-efficient antibodies for two key histone PTM targets (H3K4me1 and
H3K4me3), generating antibodies that exhibit a >5-10x increase in nucleosome capture efficiency vs. current
best-in-class antibodies. Importantly, these ultra-efficient antibodies generated significantly greater signal-to-
noise in genomic mapping assays that employ low cell inputs, demonstrating strong proof-of-concept for our
approach. In Phase II, we will leverage this validated antibody development pipeline to develop a suite of ultra-
efficient antibodies and use these reagents to develop low input and SC CUT&Tag assays for breakthrough
immunology research. Toward this goal, we will first develop and screen antibodies for high-value histone PTM
targets (Aim 1). We will then scale up production and rigorously validate antibody lots in CUT&Tag assays using
both low input and SC workflows (Aim 2). Finally, we will test the application of our next-generation ultra-efficient
antibodies to enable cutting-edge immunological research and provide our antibodies and validated protocols to
leading epigenetics laboratories for beta testing (Aim 3). This research project will result in the development of
a new class of histone PTM antibodies that will be used to increase the utility of CUT&Tag assays for
breakthrough chromatin research and drug discovery."

Epitranscriptomics is the study of RNA modifications, which include more than 170 naturally occurring chemical
alternations to the nucleotides. More than 60 are found in human RNA of all types: mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, lncRNA,
and the others. These modifications are dynamic; their global quantities change in development and during
disease progression. They are installed by writer enzymes, read by reader proteins and removed by eraser
enzymes, and they have an intrinsic capacity to alter RNA structure and dynamics. They influence translation
initiation and termination, translation fidelity, alternative splicing, trafficking between cellular compartments, and
regulate RNA degradation. RNA reader, writer and eraser proteins are promising drug targets of high current
interest to pharma. Currently available analytical methods either do not report on sequence context or provide
sequence information but at the expense of multiplexing capability. Despite these limitations, it is now known
that modifications are dynamically tied to phenotypic changes in cancer progression, drug resistance, aging, and
viral infection. Alida Biosciences is developing a new commercial platform to detecting, identifying, and mapping
RNA modifications in a multiplex and with high sensitivity—suitable for clinical samples (e.g. needle biopsies,
FFPE samples) in which low quantities of RNA may be available. Following completion of our Phase I milestones
focused on creating the new multiplexed assay and proof-of-concept testing, this proposal aims to (1) complete
assay development, optimizing sensitivity, specificity, and a robust and user-friendly workflow, (2) develop assay
automation, and (3) perform assay validation in preparation for commercial launch. This technology will be
significant because it will provide the first commercial platform capable of profiling and correlating changes of
multiple RNA modification types across the entire transcriptome in a given sample."

Synopsis: This is a K01 application by Dr. Luis Escobar, researcher on zoonotic infectious diseases. Escobar’s project
Integrative Spatial Epidemiology Study of Wildlife Rabies Spillover will combine spatial modeling with large
epidemiological, genomic, and ecological data to investigate pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans and livestock.
Candidate: PI Escobar, DVM/MSc/PhD, is a tenure-track Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech, with prior postdoctoral
training at SUNY Upstate Medical University and the University of Minnesota and a strong record of scientific
achievements. This application has three training objectives to strengthen Escobar’s research as an independent investigator:
(1) Training in bioinformatics; (2) Integrate bioinformatics with spatial epidemiology; and (3) Gaining skills in laboratory
management and research proposal development to transition to career independence.
Mentors: Prof. X.J. Meng, with a solid history of NIH funding, outstanding expertise in bioinformatics, and at the
applicant’s institution, will serve as Primary Mentor. Four additional mentors (Drs. Z. Tu, W. Hopkins, S. VandeWoude,
A.T. Peterson) will provide complementary expertise and will assess Escobar’s progress towards career independence.
Research: Emergent infectious diseases, such as Ebola, Nipah, and COVID-19, have been linked to pathogen spillover
from bats to other species. A gap in knowledge exists in the fundamental ecology of pathogen spillover transmission (i.e.,
Where does it occur and why?), which limits understanding of previous epidemics and capacities to prevent disease
emergence. This project will study pathogen spillover from bats to humans and livestock using rabies from the common
vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), a well-documented system of a virus that frequently spills from D. rotundus bats over to
other species. While D. rotundus-rabies is restricted to Latin America, it is rapidly expanding towards the United States
(US) for unknown reasons. The central hypothesis is that D. rotundus-rabies spillover does not occur randomly in the
geography but follows specific biodiversity and habitat patterns, which can be used to predict where pathogen spillover will
occur. Aim 1 will determine the role of habitat and virus lineage on rabies-spillover to humans and livestock across Latin
America. Aim 2 will identify effect of biodiversity composition on rabies virus spillover transmission. Aim 3 will investigate
genomic, geographic, and environmental factors shaping the spread of rabies virus. This hypothesis-driven project has
conceptual and technological innovations and combines the expertise of PI Escobar and mentors to illuminate ecological
drivers of rabies spillover. Findings will offer new mechanistic insights to explain and anticipate pathogen spillover. As
such, this K01 application will facilitate Escobar’ s transition towards research independence and offers exciting discoveries
on the ecology of spillover transmission, aligned with the NIH mission to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature of
living systems to enhance human health."
10754971,"Metabolic regulation of muscle satellite cell homeostasis and function
Abstract
Muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) are resident stem cells in the skeletal muscle responsible for its postnatal growth,
maintenance and regeneration. MuSCs in adult homeostatic muscles are predominantly in the quiescent state.
In response to injury, quiescent MuSCs are activated, enter the cell cycle and proliferate as myoblasts, then
differentiate to repair the injury or self-renew to replenish the stem cell pool. The homeostasis of these various
cell states (quiescence, activation, proliferation, differentiation and self-renewal) is necessary to support multiple
rounds of successful and sustainable regeneration throughout the lifetime. Despite the remarkable progress
accomplished in the past decades, the key regulators and signaling mechanisms underlying the homeostasis
and function of MuSCs remain elusive. Lipid droplets (LDs) are cellular organelles commonly found in
adipocytes, where they function as a central hub for lipid biosynthesis, storage and utilization that are crucial for
cell metabolism and signaling. Recent studies have begun to elucidate a paramount role of LDs in cancer cell
metabolism and pathogenesis, but the presence and role of LDs in tissue stem cells including MuSCs have only
been explored very recently. Preliminary studies in the PI's laboratory have led to the discovery of highly dynamic
LDs in MuSCs along their myogenic progression in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, LDs are not present in any
quiescent MuSCs but emerge in activated MuSCs and increase in abundance in proliferating myoblasts.
Strikingly, unequal distribution of LDs is observed in some newly divided sister cells exhibiting hallmarks of
asymmetric cell fate segregation. In addition, fatty acid metabolic pathways are dynamically regulated in a pattern
similar to the dynamics of LDs, and perturbations of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) disrupts MuSC homeostasis and
function. Based on these observations, it is hypothesized that LDs regulate MuSC homeostasis and function
through influencing cellular energy supply and/or lipid metabolite-mediated signaling. Two aims are
developed to test this central hypothesis. The first aim will examine the role of LDs in MuSC homeostasis and
regenerative function in vivo. The second aim will dissect how LD dynamics are regulated and how lipid
metabolism in turn regulates MuSC homeostasis and function. Completion of the proposed study is expected to
establish LDs as a novel cell fate marker and understand how lipid metabolism regulates MuSC fates. Previous
studies have identified immortal DNA strands, centrosomes, mitochondria and various proteins as cell fate
determinants, the identification of LD as an additional cell fate regulator opens a new chapter in stem cell biology.
The knowledge will also facilitate the development of mitigation strategies to improve the regeneration and
function of skeletal muscles during aging or under pathological conditions."

Parental death is one of the most stressful events of childhood and is associated with increased risk for
multiple mental health problems as well as impairments in developmental competencies in childhood and
adulthood. This study uses a secondary data analysis of a 15-year longitudinal study of a randomized trial of
the Family Bereavement Program (FBP) to characterize the developmental trajectories of problems and
competencies of bereaved children over six years; to study the effects of the FBP to reduce problem
trajectories; and to study how changing these trajectories account for FBP effects on mental disorder in young
adulthood 15 years later. The study builds on a major advance in research to assess individual differences in
trajectories of outcomes over time following potentially traumatic events such as bereavement. Multiple studies
using this method have concluded that the great majority of children and adults have low levels of problems
over time and can be considered to be resilient. The current study questions this conclusion which is based on
the assessment of trajectories of single outcomes (a unidimensional approach) and does not consider that
different people may experience problems in different ways following adversity. Recent research with bereaved
adults adapted a multidimensional approach to assess trajectories across five outcomes and found that few
adults (only 8%) had low levels of problems across outcomes. The current study adapt this multidimensional
approach to assess trajectories of grief, mental health problems, competencies and risk and protective factors
over a six year period for bereaved children in a secondary analysis of data from the longitudinal study of the
FBP. This is the first study to apply a multidimensional approach to assess individual trajectories of four
domains of outcomes (grief, mental health problems, developmental competencies and risk and protective
factors) of children following any major adversity. The findings have significant implications for understanding
which bereaved children who could benefit from evidence-based services. The study will apply the
multidimensional approach to assess the effects of the FBP on trajectories of problem and competence
outcomes as well as targeted risk and protective factors over six years. It will also assess the effects of the
FBP to improve the aggregate number of problem trajectories across outcomes. Individuals for whom the FBP
reduces one or more problem trajectories can be considered responders to the program. The study will also
assess how changing trajectories in problems, competencies or risk and protective factors across six years in
childhood and adolescence mediate FBP effects to reduce mental disorder, suicidal ideation/behavior or
mental health service use nine years later when participants are young adults. Findings from these analyses
have action implications to optimize effective dissemination of components of the FBP that target mediators
that are successfully changed by the program and that mediate FBP effects on adult mental health problems."

Reciprocal interactions among neuroglial and vascular components of the postnatal retina are critical for proper

neuronal synaptic activity in the retina influences these processes; b) which neurotransmitter(s) contribute to
these processes; and c) whether neurotransmitters act on endothelial cells (ECs) directly or indirectly, via
astrocytes or Müller cells. The superficial plexus vasculature develops (P1-P8) during the spontaneous
cholinergic wave of neural activity (P0-P10) and photoactivation of Opn4+ retinal ganglion cells (RGC). In
contrast, the deep plexus vasculature and BRB development span cholinergic and glutamatergic waves of neural
activity (P10-P14), glutamatergic synaptic activity of photoreceptors (P10 onwards) as well as photoactivation of
Opn4+ RGCs. Transient pharmacological blockade of cholinergic wave impairs deep plexus angiogenesis and
BRB maturation; however, the role of extracellular glutamate in these processes is unknown. In preliminary
findings, we have primarily used three mouse strains to assess the effects of synaptic glutamate release on
retinal angiogenesis and the BRB: a) Vglut1 -/-, that lack glutamate release, b) Gnat1-/-, in which rod
photoreceptors remain depolarized, thus release excess glutamate, and c) Chrnb2-/-, where cholinergic wave is
abolished and glutamatergic wave begins early (P8). We have found that synaptic glutamate release is a positive
regulator of deep plexus angiogenesis and BRB maturation. This effect is mediated by inducing expression of
Norrin in Müller glia and Norrin/b-catenin pathway activation in ECs. Based on these preliminary data, we
hypothesize that released glutamate levels are sensed by Müller cells, which in turn operate as transducers to
induce expression of angiogenic and BRB-forming factors and promote deep plexus angiogenesis and BRB
maturation. We will test this hypothesis through three aims. First, we will examine how modulation of glutamate
levels [Vglut1-/- mice (no glutamate release), Gnat1-/- mice (high glutamate release), and Chrnb2-/- mice (early
onset of glutamatergic wave)] regulates retinal angiogenesis and structural and functional BRB integrity. Next,
we will determine whether Müller cells respond to extracellular glutamate levels by inducing expression of
angiogenic and barriergenic factors. We will examine Müller cell response [cell number, expression of GLAST
(Slc1a3; a major glutamate transporter), glutamine synthetase (enzyme responsible for converting glutamate to
glutamine) and Norrin (the major Wnt ligand expressed by Müller cells)] in Vglut1-/-, Gnat1-/- and Chrnb2-/- mice.
Finally, we will test if activation of endothelial Norrin/b-catenin signalling that promotes angiogenesis and BRB
maturation can rescue deficits in Vglut1-/- mice. These studies will provide a mechanistic understanding of how
glutamatergic synaptic activity regulates angiogenesis and BRB in the developing retina and provide new insights
into effects of excitotoxicity on neurodegenerative diseases in the retina."

diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of tuberculosis (TB) globally, including drug-resistant TB and TB/HIV co-
infection. Her experience with U.S. and international public health programs, including the Centers for Disease
Control & Prevention (CDC) where she trained and worked for a decade, provides a strong foundation for
integrating research into policy and patient care. This K24 award will allow her to enhance and expand her
successful mentorship in POR by providing vital protected time for training in advanced methods for studying
TB transmission, and developing a structured mentoring program. Worldwide, TB is the leading cause of death
among people living with HIV, with drug-resistant TB threatening decades of progress in TB and HIV control.
Drug-resistant TB epidemics are driven primarily by person-to-person transmission of resistant strains, and
innovative approaches to improve our understanding of TB transmission are urgently needed to guide effective
interventions. Similarly, there is a need to train the next generation of scientists in multidisciplinary TB/HIV and
global health POR. Dr. Shah’s robust research program supported by NIH, Gates Foundation, and CDC
provides exciting training opportunities that attract trainees interested in multidisciplinary TB & HIV POR. She
has a strong track record of mentorship of U.S. and international trainees in diverse areas of TB & HIV clinical
research, and many of her mentees have pursued academic careers and K awards. In addition, through her
role as Director of the Clinical Core for the NIH P30 Emory/Georgia TB Research Advancement Center and
mentor on D43 and T32 programs, she is well placed to provide outstanding research and training
opportunities. Biospecimens, clinical, and epidemiologic data from Dr. Shah’s ongoing NIH R01-funded
CONTEXT study provide new opportunities for insights into TB transmission, including the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on social contact patterns that are a key factor in disease spread. The CONTEXT study
will serve as the parent study for the new research proposed in this K24 that will: 1) characterize Mtb genomic
relatedness using long-read sequencing and evaluate the impact on transmission networks; and 2)
characterize changes in social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic and estimate the impact on TB
incidence. Each aim is designed to integrate mentees who have experience and interest in growing their
careers in these emerging areas of TB transmission science. Dr. Shah’s research and mentoring program is
facilitated by her long-standing, cross-disciplinary collaborations with leading experts in mycobacterial
genomics, pharmacology, immunology, clinical trials, and mathematical modeling. In addition, the outstanding
training resources, funding opportunities, and research infrastructure at Emory will be integrated into Dr.
Shah’s mentoring program to create an environment that enables the success of her trainees to pursue
independent, impactful careers in TB, HIV, and global health POR."
10831006,"Tuberculosis (TB) chemotherapy eliminates disease symptoms, but often fails to sterilize Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) leaving apparently cured TB patients at risk of disease relapse. How Mtb survives during post-
treatment persistent infections (PTPI) is ill defined and we lack a full understanding of the immune determinants
that prevent progression to active TB (relapse).
We developed a paucibacillary (low bacterial numbers) mouse model that mimics PTPI in in humans. We found
that silencing of in vivo essential genes cured Mtb infections in mice to the extent that colony forming units (CFU)
were no longer detected on agar plates. However, as in humans, mice were often not sterilized, and
paucibacillary infection resulted in relapse TB. Our model allows us to interrogate both, the mechanisms that
enable Mtb to persist despite host immunity and the host factors that are required to control and sterilize Mtb
infection. We will use this model to (1) compare post-treatment persistent infection (PTPI) in mice and humans
(2) determine the importance of specific leukocyte subsets for the establishment or control of paucibacillary Mtb
infection and (3) identify Mtb genes that are required for paucibacillary persistence."
10839315,"Abstract: HIV cure has not been achieved due to long-lasting latent HIV reservoirs that, upon ART
interruption, reactivate the virus. The best characterized viral reservoirs are different circulating
subpopulations of T lymphocytes, but it has become evident that most viral reservoirs are localized in
several tissues, including the brain. However, little is known about HIV persistence in myeloid cells,
becoming a controversial issue.
 Only recently, genetic phylogenetic analysis indicates that viral reactivation cannot be explained
by CD4 T containing the virus. Thus, alternative reservoirs need to be considered, such as a myeloid cell.
Myeloid tissue-associated cells have multiple advantages over T cells to consider long-lasting viral
reservoirs including tissue location, long-life, slow turn around, and higher resistance to apoptosis
compared to T cells. In the brain, microglia and macrophages are the main cell type with HIV-integrated.
 Our data identify macrophage/microglia as a key viral reservoir within the brain, even in
long-term ART. We developed an in vitro system to generate latent infected microglia or macrophages
that can be reactivated by multiple treatments, including Meth, LPS, and LRA. The latently HIV-infected
macrophages/microglia cells survive infection by blocking the apoptosome's formation by increasing bim
protein expression, preventing further apoptosis. Further, we identified that latently HIV-infected cells
(microglia/macrophages) had a unique metabolic signature that relies on glutamate/glutamine for ATP
production and survival. More surprising is that HIV reservoirs cannot switch between different carbon
sources such as lipids, glucose, or unusual sources of carbon like amino acids like uninfected cells.
Blocking these metabolic pathways results in significant apoptosis of HIV reservoirs even in the absence
of reactivation.
 Our results will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the generation
and survival of HIV myeloid reservoirs within the CNS and provide essential information for eradicating
these viral reservoirs from the CNS."

Cancer incidence is significantly increasing in many sub-Saharan Africa countries necessitating a shift in
training and research to address this growing problem. Years ago Ghana recognized this problem and
identified cancer sites for prioritization for both research and clinical care in their National Cancer Control Plan.
These cancers include breast (BCa), cervical (CxCa), head and neck (HNCa) and prostate cancer (PCa). To
address the goals set forth in the national cancer plan Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) faculty have been
collaborating with the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital within the University of Ghana (UG), and the Ghana College
of Physician and Surgeons (GCPS) for the past five years to build collaborative research and cancer clinical
care capacity. This work started initially with a focus on PCa and HNCa, two cancers of common concern and
interest, as the incidence and mortality associated with these cancers disproportionally affects Ghanaians and
US African Americans. Recognizing the need to expand research to BCa and CxCa in Ghana the MCC-Ghana
collaboration is poised to expand efforts to these two additional cancers and to expand existing research and
training collaborations to create a comprehensive and structured program with greater depth and breadth. We
propose to expand the existing list of collaborating institutions in Ghana to include the University of Ghana
Medical School (UGMS), School of Public Health (UGSPH), and Nursing School. In addition, we plan to adapt
a comprehensive cancer research training program developed as part of a completed Fogarty D43 Morocco
grant, to accelerate the implementation of cancer research training in Ghana. The overall goal of this proposal
is to develop a new generation of multidisciplinary global health cancer researchers at MCC and UG by
implementing programs that will strengthen and expand institutional capacity to broadly conduct cancer
research - Ghana IntegRative Approach to Cancer ResEarch Training: The GRACE Program. Specifically, we
propose the following: 1. Build and implement cancer research training and capacity (Lectures and Workshops
and an Applied Research Experience); 2. Fund Team-Science Research, and; 3. Transfer and sustain the
Ghana cancer research training program. At the end of five years we will have trained a new generation of
fellows and junior faculty (~125-150) and embedded into the Ghana medical education system a sustainable
cancer research training program to support continued cancer research growth in Ghana. The proposed training
program will advance research among physician scientists practicing oncology and recruit talented
professionals from related health fields to conduct cancer research, thereby rapidly expanding cancer research
in Ghana. By engaging those from multiple disciplines, the proposed program will strengthen Ghana’s existing
national and multidisciplinary cancer-specific research teams. Ultimately, our goal is to have this training
program serve as a bridge between academic, policy makers, and public health communities."

To date, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has caused over 32 million
cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with ~1 million associated deaths. Multiple vaccine trials have
begun in an effort to stop this pandemic, yet the correlates of viral clearance and immune protection from
SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown. In fact, there are no licensed vaccines to any human coronavirus, as we have
not yet discovered the immunologic correlates of a successful coronavirus vaccine. In his brief tenure in the
Iwasaki lab, Dr. Goldman-Israelow has already developed a highly adaptable mouse model of SARS-CoV-2
infection that can be applied to mice of any genotype. He published this work as co-first author in the Journal of
Experimental Medicine. He also showed that innate immune activation drives acute pathology. However, the
extent to which innate immune signals drive adaptive immunity remains to be explored. This proposal will
address how: (1) type I interferon signaling and (2) cGAS signaling control antibody development to SARS-
CoV-2. This work is critical for characterizing the fundamental rules that govern adaptive immunity to SARS-
CoV-2, which will promote the development of highly effective vaccines.
This proposal describes a rigorous five-year career development training program for Benjamin Goldman-
Israelow, M.D., Ph.D., with the goal of preparing him for an independent research career as an academic
physician-scientist. The principal investigator is a physician scientist who completed his M.D. and Ph.D.
training in Biomedical Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, where he studied molecular
virology. Dr. Goldman-Israelow continued his training by joining the Physician Scientist Research Pathway at
Yale New Haven Hospital, a combined residency and fellowship program, and is currently an infectious
diseases fellow. He has embarked on an intensive training program to broaden his expertise in viral
immunology under the mentorship of Dr. Akiko Iwasaki, a pioneer and world leader in deciphering the complex
interplay among viruses, innate immune recognition, and adaptive immunity. Dr. Iwasaki is not only a world-
class scientist, but also a world-class mentor with a very productive track record of mentoring physician-
scientists. In addition to the intellectual grooming and practical laboratory-based training that Dr. Goldman-
Israelow will continue to receive in Dr. Iwasaki’s lab, he has developed a training program built on high-yield
didactic coursework. He has also carefully crafted an advisory committee comprising translational scientists
with a broad range of scientific expertise relevant to this proposal and impressive records of mentorship. Yale
School of Medicine, along with its Departments of Internal Medicine and Immunobiology, will provide the
resources, support, and infrastructure to assist Dr. Goldman-Israelow in achieving the aims described in this
proposal and his long-term goal of developing into an independent physician-scientist studying the rules that

10844490,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Very preterm infant growth patterns are linked to neurodevelopmental and health outcomes, yet, ideal growth
pattern trajectories have not been established as a means to guide nutritional intervention for this population.
With the majority of very preterm infants exhibiting growth below the expected fetal or infant trajectory, greater
characterization of very preterm infant growth is an essential step to elucidate the role of nutrition in the care
and development of preterm infants. The overarching objective is to identify very preterm infant growth patterns
prior to term age and across the first year of life that are phenotypically-defined (maternal, infant, and
environmental factors including social determinants of health) and determine the impact of the phenotypically-
informed growth patterns on very preterm infant neurodevelopmental and health outcomes. We hypothesize
that phenotypic-derived latent class growth analysis-derived curves encompassing clinical and environmental
exposures across the continuum of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and post-discharge periods will
identify growth patterns predictive of outcomes. To investigate this hypothesis, patterns of growth will be
classified for two sentinel epochs spanning birth to 36 weeks' gestational age (the NICU period) and birth to 12
months' corrected age (infancy). Through a detailed collection of maternal and infant health, social and
environmental determinants of health, nutrient intake, and body composition; the very preterm infant exposures
differentially represented in these phenotypically-informed growth patterns will be identified. Subsequently, the
impact of these phenotypically-informed growth patterns on neurodevelopmental and health outcomes will be
determined. Lastly, a repository of longitudinally-collected biologic samples through the first two years of age
will be established to foster a deeper exploration of the metabolic processes related to the identified
phenotypes. This examination will be the first to bridge the NICU and post-hospital discharge epochs to
investigate growth trajectory without predetermined expectations and informed by extensive nutrition, health,
and social data. Through this investigation of phenotypically-defined growth patterns, the modifiable factors
influencing growth trajectory and its link to very preterm infant outcomes will be revealed to inform both clinical
care and future interventional trials to optimize nutrition and growth for each very preterm infant."
10839891,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a dramatic decline in AIDS-associated
mortality. However, as persons with HIV (PWH) age, mortality from non-AIDS-defining cancer (NADC)
continues to increase and is now the leading cause of death for PWH. Recent studies have demonstrated
persistent disparities in both initiation of cancer therapy and survival among PWH and cancer compared with
the general population. This may be due in part to medical and radiation oncologists' concerns regarding the
safety and efficacy of cancer treatment for PWH. Alternatively, it is possible that chemotherapy with radiation
therapy (CRT) and radiation therapy (RT) alone may be less effective in PWH or associated with greater
toxicity. It is well established that positive cancer outcomes are dependent on successful navigation of all steps
in the cancer care delivery process, including: timely treatment initiation, treatment completion, and treatment
safety, defined by avoidance of serious adverse events (SAEs). It is also critical to evaluate the ongoing health
needs of cancer survivors with HIV, including the risk of long-term chronic health conditions (i.e., late adverse
effects) after cancer treatment. Prior studies have evaluated cancer treatment initiation rates for certain
cancers, however, there have been no published studies that have comprehensively evaluated differences in
outcomes at other key steps in the cancer care delivery process for PWH compared with people without HIV
(HIV-), nor have there been studies that have evaluated patient- and provider-factors that might contribute to
disparities at each step. We propose the following Specific Aims which will address these critical knowledge
gaps for the four most common NADCs in PWH treated with CRT/RT (anal, head and neck, lung, or prostate
cancer): Aim 1: To evaluate differences in the timing of cancer treatment initiation between PWH and matched
HIV- with cancer, and risk factors for delayed treatment in PWH. Aim 2: To evaluate disparities in short-term
SAEs and cancer treatment completions between PWH and matched HIV- patients who initiated CRT/RT. Aim
3: To evaluate the long-term risk of mortality and cancer recurrence comparing PWH with cancer and matched
HIV- patients. Aim 4: To compare risk of chronic health conditions among PWH with cancer, with (a) HIV- with
cancer and (b) PWH without cancer. In addition to evaluating differences in outcomes between PWH and HIV-
patients with cancer, study aims will also evaluate the impacts of key potential risk factors, including: ART
regimens, immunosuppression, and treatment dosage and completion, which may be associated with CRT/RT
outcomes. This observational cohort study will identify >3,000 PWH diagnosed with cancer, 1:1 matched HIV-
persons with the same cancers, and 4:1 matched PWH without cancer who have received care from the
Veteran's Administration or Kaiser Permanente, the two largest single-payer integrated healthcare systems in
the United States. Study findings will provide data to provide targets for cancer care delivery and treatment
interventions, and inform HIV-specific cancer treatment guidelines to improve cancer survival among PWH."
10841597,"One of the remaining fundamental challenges we face in pharmacology is deciphering the mechanisms of
action of general anesthetics (GAs). A complete anesthetic state involves loss of consciousness (hypnosis)
and movement (immobilization), as well as loss of pain sensation (analgesia) and recollection of the event
(amnesia). It is believed that GAs act through the multiple but specific proteins on neuronal membrane and
different ligand-gated and voltage-gated ion channels have received a significant consideration. One of
the compelling reasons to study voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in the mechanisms of anesthetic
actions is that these channels are essential in regulation of synaptic transmission and excitability in the
neuronal sleep pathway (e.g. thalamus) and in the brain regions involved in learning/memory (e.g. hippo-
campal formation). Importantly, our previous studies have established that low-voltage-activated subtype
of VGCCs or T-type calcium channels (T-channels) are inhibited by different classes of GAs within the
clinically relevant concentration range. For the past two decades our work has established the role of the
family of T-type VGCCs in acute and chronic pain processing, including post-surgical pain. However the
role of VGCCs in the mechanisms of GA-induced hypnosis and amnesia remains elusive. Furthermore,
despite substantial progress that has been made in the last two decades towards our understanding of
how GAs act at the molecular level, much less is known about how GAs cause hypnosis and memory
deficit at the level of intact neuronal networks. Hence, this proposal aims to elucidate the contribution of
specific subtypes of T-channels to anesthetic effects in the thalamocortical (Research area 1) and hippo-
campal circuitry (Research area 2). We will take advantage of mouse genetics, selective knock-down of
different T-channel isoforms ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology, optical recordings, as well as a battery
of behavioral tests to address these key challenges. Our proposed work has the potential to overturn ex-
isting dogma about anesthetic mechanisms and to shift the focus to underappreciated targets, such as
neuronal T-channels. We posit that understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms of action of GAs
that target T-channels may be used as a starting point to develop novel and potentially safer approaches
and practices in clinical anesthesia. MIRA mechanism is well suited to achieve our stated goals because
of flexibility to pursue new avenues within the research area of interest to NIGMS. Consistent productivity
of our lab and our ability to collaborate with others in the field of anesthetic pharmacology strongly suggest
that our approach will be fruitful. The proposed work is innovative in that new mechanisms of useful clinical
effects of general anesthetics such as loss of consciousness and amnesia will be characterized. It is med-
ically significant because it describes the importance of drugs that target voltage-gated calcium channels
for potential development of safer practices in clinical anesthesia."
10874450,"Sleep loss and sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea) lead to excessive daytime sleepiness and impaired
attention & cognition. The symptoms of sleep disturbance are now recognized as major contributors to
accident rates and decreased workplace productivity. Attention, concentration, and cognitive problems are also
a major feature of other disorders that are prevalent in US veterans – e.g., TBI, PTSD, Alzheimer's disease,
depression, substance use disorder, and schizophrenia. Understanding the brain circuitry controlling attention
will guide the development of treatments to ameliorate the attention and cognitive impairments of these
conditions. Abundant evidence indicates that the basal forebrain (BF) region contains cortically projecting &
wakefulness promoting neurons that are important for cortical activation, behavioral arousal/alertness, and
attention. Although previous work has focused on the role of BF cholinergic neurons in attention, advances in
optogenetic methods allow the investigation of BF parvalbumin (PV) containing GABAergic neurons. Work on
our current Merit grant indicates that selective excitation of BF PV neurons in mice produces cortical activation,
wakefulness, and behavioral arousal. Our new preliminary data suggest that excitation of BF PV neurons can
enhance attention, cognition, and rescue reaction time performance impairments produced by sleep loss.
 The findings described led us to two testable hypotheses: 1) BF PV neurons mediate rapid changes in
alertness/attention by quickly activating the cortex in response to meaningful or surprising sensory stimuli.
2) Excitation of BF PV neurons does not alter motivation (e.g., hunger) and is not rewarding indicating these
neurons can enhance attention and cognition with limited side effects and low addictive potential. Our model
prediction: In response to meaningful or surprising sensory stimuli, BF PV neurons briefly activate the cortex,
enhancing cortical processing and alertness which facilitates attention-dependent reaction time performance
and associative learning. The work will address a gap in our knowledge by demonstrating that regulation of
cortical activation by BF PV neurons is important for the control of attention. Methods used include fiber
photometry to measure the activity of BF PV neurons and optogenetics to excite and inhibit these neurons in
mice; both will be combined with behavioral tests and measures of cortical electrical activity. The 3 aims are:
 Aim 1 will demonstrate that increasing and decreasing the activity of BF PV neurons can modulate cortical
responses to repetitive presentations of sensory stimuli. This finding will provide a plausible mechanism for
how these neurons enhance the attention dependent behavioral performance studied in Aims 2 & 3.
 Aim 2 will demonstrate that BF PV excitation enhances sustained attention and performance in a mouse
reaction time test like the test used in humans to detect sleepiness and sustained attention deficits.
Experiments will demonstrate that sleep deprivation (SD) and BF PV inhibition slows reaction times, whereas
BF PV excitation will quicken reaction times and will rescue deficits produced by SD.
 Aim 3. Attention is also important for learning and here BF PV manipulations are used to alter the attention
needed for associative learning. Our predictions, supported by preliminary data, are that BF PV excitation
enhances associative learning by broadcasting `surprise' signals to the cortex that are encoded in high
frequency cortical gamma oscillations, and that BF PV excitation does not affect reward pathways. We also
predict that BF PV inhibition and SD will impair attention-dependent associative learning.
 If successful, this project will show that the BF PV neuron excitation model enhances attention and
cognition with limited side effects and low addictive potential. This model can be readily applied to mouse
models of other conditions that are prevalent in the US Veteran population. Future work could also identify
novel therapeutics to pharmacologically target receptors on BF PV neurons in order to activate them."
10840423,"Hematopoietic development is an ordered process in which stem cells give rise to multiple lineages.
While early progenitors can be multipotent, lineage-specific progenitors reach a stage where they
become exclusively committed to that lineage. For example, B and T cell lineages differentiate from
lymphoid-primed progenitors produced in the bone marrow, and exclusive commitment to the B cell
lineage occurs as cells transition from the pre-pro-B to the pro-B cell stage. Despite the commitment of
pro-B cells to the B lineage, we have made the surprising discovery that conditional knock-out of the
ubiquitous multi-functional transcription factor YY1 in pro-B cells, results in the loss of B lineage
commitment and the consequent ability to develop into the T cell lineage both in vitro and in vivo. To
understand the mechanistic basis for this surprising lineage plasticity, we have developed a new lineage
tracing mouse line that will enable us to determine how YY1-null pro-B cells develop into T lineage cells
(de-differentiation to more primitive progenitors, or trans-differentiation), assess the potential for YY1-
null pro-B cells to develop into other hematopoietic lineages, and determine if YY1-null T cells also
exhibit lineage plasticity (Aim 1). Mechanistically, lineage-specific transcription factors bind to DNA and
regulate gene expression prior to subsequent large-scale alterations in chromatin structure needed for
lineage commitment. Rigorous studies by our laboratory as well as others indicate that despite its
ubiquitous expression pattern, YY1 controls long-range chromatin interactions (LRCIs) in a lineage-
specific fashion. Our findings support the hypothesis that DNA binding by lineage-specific transcription
factors enables YY1 recruitment to distinct genomic loci, thereby enabling YY1 to both generate LRCIs
that stabilize lineage-appropriate gene expression, and to generate repressive chromatin marks
(H3K27me3) at lineage-inappropriate genes. We will thus, compare the molecular genetic phenotype
(gene expression patterns, chromatin accessibility, epigenetic structure, and chromatin folding) of YY1-
null pro-B cells developed into DN1, DN2a, DN2b, DN3, DP, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells, compared to wild-
type T lineage cells, as well as YY1 conditional knockout T lineage cells (Aim 2). We hypothesize that in
the absence of YY1, T lineage development can proceed, but LRCIs needed to stably maintain lineage-
specific gene expression, and heterochromatin needed for repression of alternative lineages will fail to
fully develop, potentially enabling continuing lineage plasticity. Our experiments may reveal a common
mechanism for controlling lineage plasticity, vastly expanding potential applicability of directing YY1-null
cells into multiple lineages."
10829487,"Epilepsy affects 50 million people worldwide. In 40% of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), antiepileptic drugs fail to prevent seizures, increasing the risk of injury, cognitive decline, and death. The impairment of inhibition by GABAergic interneurons (IN) is a key pathomechanism of epilepsy, however, our incomplete understanding of the network function of the diverse types of IN limits the development of treatment strategies. Perisomatic inhibition by basket cells controls the rate and synchrony of the firing of excitatory neurons. The two types of basket cells, expressing either cholecystokinin (CCK) or parvalbumin (PV), are equally abundant and are both preserved in chronic epilepsy. However, why there are two distinct classes of perisomatic IN, and how their function is altered in epilepsy, is not known. The candidate’s long-term goal is to develop a career as an independent neuroscientist to understand the role of interneuron diversity in neuronal microcircuit function, and how dysfunction in various interneuron subtypes is involved in and leads to epilepsy. Using recently developed tools to record the activity of CCK and PV IN selectively in awake, behaving animals, preliminary results show that in the hippocampus, the brain area most affected by TLE, CCK and PV IN are recruited in distinct brain states. Moreover, the activity of PV IN is correlated positively, while the activity of CCK IN is correlated negatively to the activity of excitatory neurons on the time scale of seconds, suggesting that CCK IN are suited to control average firing rates and associativity across the network. Therefore, the hypothesis of the current proposal is that the two classes of perisomatic IN are recruited in separate brain states in epilepsy, and this may lead to distinct outcome of antiepileptic interventions that selectively target CCK or PV IN. This proposal presents a plan to test this hypothesis in a chronic animal model of TLE (intrahippocampal kainate), using in vitro electrophysiology and in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging with correlated hippocampal field potential recording, to: 1) Test the hypothesis that CCK and PV IN are recruited in different brain states in epilepsy; 2) Test the hypothesis that excitatory inputs and reciprocal inhibition contribute to the differential recruitment of PV and CCK IN; and 3) Test the hypothesis that CCK IN are effective in dampening network activity in TLE without disrupting the representation of spatial information. Completion of the proposed study may advance the field by: 1) establishing a previously unknown temporal segregation of the activity of interneurons; 2) determining the underlying circuit mechanism; and 3) determining the efficacy of CCK IN for antiepileptic intervention. In addition, the candidate proposes a personalized plan to obtain training in scientific background (particularly in the epilepsy field), research methods (chronic epilepsy models and in vitro electrophysiology), and career development (grant writing, teaching and scientific management). The mentoring of Prof Ivan Soltesz at Stanford University will provide an ideal environment for the candidate to carry out the research and training plan successfully and thus will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program."
10908272,"After more than 30 years of using β-lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) in the treatment of patients, pressing questions
still remain at the forefront of our clinical efforts. Although, the value of β-lactam/BLI combinations (e.g.,
piperacillin/tazobactam) was well-established by the 1990s, the rapid emergence of β-lactamases that
hydrolyzed expanded spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and were resistant to inactivation by BLIs created
a global crisis in antimicrobial chemotherapy and propelled the quest for a novel class of inhibitors, the
diazabicyclooctanes (DBOs). In addition to the extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), the major challenges
to overcome in Klebsiella pneumoniae are the serine carbapenemases (e.g., KPC-2, OXA-48) and the metallo-
β-lactamases (MBLs) (e.g., NDM-1, VIM and IMP). Fortunately, avibactam (AVI), a DBO BLI, inactivates KPC-2
and OXA-48; the efficacy of AVI against MBLs is absent.
 Our investigations in the previous grant cycle awarded us with unprecedented and frightening insights.
We were painfully reminded that we cannot anticipate β-lactamase evolution; the diversity in amino acid
sequences that nature can yield and their impact on catalytic activity and resistance are unpredictable. We found
to our dismay that KPC-2 β-lactamase variants expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B with the amino acid
substitutions, S130G, K234R, and R220M conferred resistance to ampicillin-AVI. Moreover, we discovered that
a single amino acid substitution in VIM-24 (R228L) confers enhanced resistance to ceftazidime and cefepime.
We came to the inevitable conclusion that: i) resistance to AVI was present before this BLI was released; and ii)
MBLs can expand their substrate profile and enhance cephalosporin resistance much like the class A and C
extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). In this Merit application, our goals are to: 1) continue to probe the
structural and mechanistic basis for resistance to AVI in KPC; 2) learn how novel substrate specificity evolves in
KPC and NDM carbapenemases. We will apply for the first time complementary structural methods (x-ray
crystallography, NMR, and Double Electron Electron Resonance, DEER) to help us understand how structure
activity relationship are defined in carbapenemases with the intent that these new insights will lead to new
approaches in BLI design. In addition, recent computational analyses of KPC-2 β-lactamase molecular dynamics
predict that “hydrophobic networks” contribute to the structural integrity and allosteric signaling of KPC-2 and
other class A β-lactamases. This novel insight defines our third goal: 3) if these hydrophobic networks contribute
to allosteric signaling, can allosteric inhibitors offer new opportunities for BLI design. The unrelenting pace of
resistance makes it imperative that we understand fundamental biochemical interactions in order to find BLIs
that act by novel mechanisms.
 Our multidisciplinary approach to studying carbapenemases will allow us to anticipate how new mutations
will effect BLI and cephem catalysis and anticipate novel resistance phenotypes. We also propose that we will
discover important conformational changes upon AVI binding and uncover networks that may be involved in
allosteric signaling. If this is confirmed, disruption of these “hydrophobic networks” will open an alternative
approach to overcoming resistance and lead to new BLIs."

A vaccine is a promising approach for stopping the spread of HIV infections. Although vaccine regimens in clinical
trials show various levels of protection against HIV, there is no effective vaccine available for a large population
yet. Preclinical and clinical data demonstrate the importance of both adjuvants and antigens for an effective HIV
vaccine. Particularly, stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) or stimulator of interferon genes (STING) boosts
the immune response of the HIV antigens in multiple animal models. Meanwhile, HIV immunogens are a critical
factor for both humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity such as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs)
and cytotoxic T cells. Despite these important advances, significant challenges remain in immunogen design,
immunogen delivery, and adjuvant choice. To overcome these challenges, we propose to integrate adjuvant
derived nanoparticles and engineered mRNA for HIV vaccine discovery. In preliminary studies, we developed
adjuvant derived nanoparticles (ANPs) using TLR or STING agonists, which showed great potential for efficient
mRNA delivery as a vaccine platform. Moreover, we constructed glycosylated HIV immunogens that trigger
mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-mediated innate immune recognition, leading to enhanced antibody responses.
Additionally, we systematically investigated the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs in order to enhance
protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of
UTRs, we identified the optimal combination of 5’ and 3’ UTR for mRNA engineering. Based on these results
and findings, the goal of this proposed project is to develop adjuvant derived nanoparticles as functional
nanomaterials capable of efficiently delivering HIV immunogens in vivo, consequently generating strong and
durable humoral and cell-mediated immunity against HIV. The following specific aims will be carried out to
accomplish our goal: 1) Synthesis and characterization of adjuvant derived nanoparticles (ANPs); 2) Engineering
of mRNA transcripts encoding various HIV immunogens with high translation efficiency; and 3) Determination of
immunogenicity and safety profiles of ANPs-mRNA in mouse and non-human primate models. Encouraged by
results from our preliminary studies, we expect the newly designed nanomaterials from this proposal to establish
a vaccine candidate, which can facilitate clinical translation and a new avenue for HIV vaccine discovery.
Knowledge gained from this study can also be extended to other types of vaccines for emerging pathogens."

The main obstacle to curing HIV-1 infection is a reservoir that consists of resting memory CD4 T cells whose genomes
contain inducible and replication-competent HIV-1 proviruses. Decay of the reservoir is slow and this has reinforced a
notion that proviral HIV-1 DNA is largely transcriptionally silent. A wide body of recent evidence has pointed to the
contrary. At any point in time, a non-negligible fraction of the HIV-1 reservoir remains transcriptionally active despite
complete suppression with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Moreover, latent HIV-1 transcription can be induced above these
apparent baseline levels with HIV-1 stimulatory compounds, deemed latency reversal agents (LRAs). Some LRAs have
been able to modestly reduce reservoir size in small clinical or pre-clinical trials of HIV-1+ humans or SIV+ rhesus
macaques (RMs). However, a current limitation of LRA use is that to date, these agents have been tested only in very
narrow patient/animal cohorts, not representative of heterogeneity that exists in the HIV-1+ population, and not accounting
for age, gender, or the prevalence of additional co-morbidities associated with HIV-1. Type 2 diabetes in particular is a co-
morbidity that is prevalent in PLWH, and is the result of an imbalance of the dietary hormone insulin. In preliminary
studies, we find that CD4 T cells (which serve as the principle reservoir for HIV-1) express the insulin receptor and respond
to insulin by activating the PI3K signaling pathway. PI3K signaling is known to be upstream of (1) metabolic regulators of
latent HIV-1 transcription (mTORC signaling) and (2) transcription factors involved in binding to the HIV-1 promoter (Sp1
and FOXO1). In these proposed studies, we will take advantage of an existing well-powered cohort of fully ART-suppressed
SIV+ RMs to probe the role of insulin signaling as a regulator of the HIV-1/SIV lifecycle. We will employ cutting-edge
phospho-proteomic methods to examine how the dietary hormone insulin influences transcription of latent SIV in (Aim 1)
the context of LRA-based biologics that share common signaling cascades with insulin and (Aim 2) the context of natural
blood glucose/insulin fluctuations that occur with dietary intake. The application will seek to define on a basic level (1) the
insulin “signalome” in CD4 T cells (2) as-yet explored dietary factors that may influence transcriptional activity of latent
HIV-1 and importantly (3) provide a conceptual framework for future studies on LRA use in settings in which insulin
signaling is impaired."
10904661,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Pain is a complex experience often associated with noxious stimulation. However, for individuals with
Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions (COPCs), the central nervous system can augment or cause pain in the
absence of noxious input. Many of these patients have diffuse hyperalgesia (elevated pain responses to
noxious stimuli) and allodynia (perception of pain for non-noxious stimuli). Additionally, chronic pain patients
are hypersensitive to a variety of sensory stimuli (such as light, odor and sound), suggesting a global
impairment in sensory processing. Pain processing in the CNS normally occurs via ascending and descending
nociceptive pathways which integrate in several brain areas, including the thalamus, and the cingulate,
somatosensory, prefrontal and insular cortices. Importantly, none of the brain regions mentioned above are
uniquely associated with the perception of pain, therefore pain most likely involves coordinated activity within a
network of brain regions that play a role in pain perception. Studying the brain as a complex network of
interconnected regions might provide unique insights to the underlying pathophysiology of chronic centralized
pain conditions
 Our overall objective is to identify neural mechanisms that contribute to sensory hypersensitivity in
chronic pain patients. The short-term training goal for the F99 phase is to learn and use quantitative sensory
testing and advanced computational methods to measure functional connectivity and network properties of
fMRI data. Network analyses will provide novel insights into the interaction of functional brain networks during
sensory processing that contribute to visual hypersensitivity. My dissertation work (Research Aims 1 & 2) along
with the training plan will provide evidence for the functional relationship between pain and visual processing
areas. This offers a foundational premise for the long-term goal, to be completed during the K00 phase, which
is to utilize multimodal imaging to investigate casual interactions between brain areas involved in pain and
sensory processing that contribute to hypersensitivity in chronic pain."

The odyssey to a diagnosis for patients with hereditary TTR amyloidosis (hATTR) often lasts years because the
signs and symptoms are non-specific. Meanwhile, patients can progress to advanced heart disease (cardiac
amyloidosis) and nerve disease (polyneuropathy). A common pathogenic TTR variant impacting African
American (4%) and Hispanic/Latino (1%) patients, V142I, confers particularly high risk for cardiac amyloidosis,
but diagnostic delays keep these groups at the margins of care. Novel therapies are now available to delay
hATTR progression; however, they cannot reverse the disease. For this reason, it is imperative to diagnose
hATTR at the earliest possible stages, when these therapies are likely to be most beneficial. Because the gold
standard for non-invasive diagnosis of hATTR-related cardiac amyloidosis, nuclear scintigraphy, involves
exposure to ionizing radiation and the sensitivity in asymptomatic patients is unknown, widespread screening by
this method is not yet justified. Traditional phenotype-first studies have identified non-cardiac red flag signs and
symptoms that herald future heart disease, but the complete phenotypic spectrum and natural history of hATTR
are not well understood, particularly in individuals at high genetic risk. To date, large diverse cohorts of individuals
with pathogenic TTR variants (TTR+) have not been extensively studied to understand the full range of clinical
features of hATTR. We propose a genotype-first study of predominantly African American and Hispanic/Latino
TTR+ individuals from the electronic health record (EHR)-linked BioMe Biobank in New York City. First, we will
perform retrospective deep phenotyping using EHRs to characterize the scope and develop a timeline of cardiac
and non-cardiac features of hATTR, and estimate age-dependent penetrance. We will perform a well-powered
phenome-wide association study, in collaboration with other biobanks, to identify novel health traits associated
with V142I. Clinical characteristics found to be enriched in TTR+ individuals will be accrued into a phenotype risk
score to help identify patients at risk for hATTR in health systems. In addition, we will conduct a prospective
study to generate evidence informing guidelines for optimal mode and timing of cardiac imaging surveillance in
high-risk TTR+ individuals across adulthood. We will recruit 100 TTR+ individuals from BioMe into a multimodal
cardiac imaging study using gold standard and cutting-edge experimental imaging approaches. Through these
endeavors, we will delineate a timeline of anticipatory systemic and cardiac imaging signatures unique to
individuals at high genetic risk for hATTR. The results will empower clinicians to recognize the disease at its
earliest stages so patients may maximally benefit from therapy. We posit that although hATTR is currently grossly
underdiagnosed in U.S. minority patients, it is in fact amenable to earlier detection through discovery of prescient
signs and symptoms, implementation of EHR-based phenotype risk scores and well-timed cardiac imaging.
These approaches will uproot disparities in the care of diverse patients at high risk for hATTR."

Recent advances in chromatin conformation capture techniques have revolutionized our understanding of chro-
matin organization and have provided novel insights at an unprecedented level of detail. Several studies have
identified biologically-relevant structures in DNA-DNA contact maps, such as A/B compartments, topologically-
associating domains (TADs), insulated neighborhoods, and have elucidated the role of chromatin architecture in
gene regulation and maintenance of cell identity. A handful of very recent studies from our lab and others have
shown that aberrant TAD activation or “rewiring” promoter-enhancer interactions can promote cancer growth.
However, no study has yet addressed the disruptions of chromatin organization on a genome-wide scale in
cancer patients or how such disruptions modify the promoter-enhancer landscape leading to drug resistance and
relapse. Using primary acute leukemia patient samples, we have, for the first time, identified recurrent TAD
disruptions in leukemia involving key oncogenes (e.g. NOTCH1, MYC) and their targets. For example, we iden-
tified a recurrent disruption of 3D chromatin topology in the MYC locus at a previously uncharacterized non-
coding CTCF-bound region that insulates MYC from downstream enhancers. This disruption enables chromatin
interactions between the MYC oncogene and the downstream enhancers leading to an increase in MYC expres-
sion. Based on our preliminary results, we propose to investigate 3D chromosomal landscape reorganization as
a new mechanism of cancer initiation, progression and relapse, and to discover novel non-coding regulatory
elements (enhancer 3D hubs and their TAD boundaries) that drive leukemia. To this end, we will first profile and
analyze a large cohort of leukemia patients using Hi-C and H3K27ac HiChIP both at diagnosis and at relapse to
identify recurrent relapse-specific 3D reorganization events. We will combine computational methods with or-
thogonal CRISPR strategies to discover transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers that enable the emergence
of drug resistance via the rewiring of enhancer-promoter chromatin looping. We will then focus on enhancer
hubs: we and others have shown that enhancers that are densely connected with target promoters and other
enhancers (i.e. enhancer hubs) are robust regulators of gene expression and their disruption can impact the
regulation of multiple genes. Based on these findings, we will test whether such enhancer hubs and their 3D
topology can be drivers of drug resistance by activating oncogenic loci in vitro and in vivo. Our proposed study
will not only elucidate the role of 3D architecture in leukemia at diagnosis and relapse, but it will also advance
our understanding of resistance to therapy and develop new approaches to overcome it."
10814213,"Receptor interacting protein kinases (RIPK)-1 and -3 are serine-threonine kinases that regulate apoptosis,
necrosis, and inflammation. RIPKs mediate programmed necrosis via RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL necrosome
assembly, and apoptosis via the ripoptosome involving FLIP, caspase-8, TRADD, and RIPK3, among others.
RIPK1 inhibitors are currently in human clinical trials for several systemic diseases. In contrast, RIPK3 has
been less studied in part because clinically acceptable RIPK3 inhibitors are not yet available. Building on our
prior studies showing improved neurological outcome in mice deficient in TNF and Fas receptor (upstream
activators of RIPK3), we used genetic tools to interrogate a possible role for RIPK3 in a mouse controlled
cortical impact (CCI) model. Mice lacking RIPK3 had improved motor and cognitive function after CCI, and
greater protection in cognitive function tests than RIPK1 kinase dead or MLKL knockout mice, suggesting a
unique role for RIPK3- independent of necroptosis because acute neuronal cell death or lesion volume was not
reduced by RIPK3 knockout. Using immunopanning to isolate specific brain cell populations, we found the
highest levels of RIPK3 expression in endothelium and immune cells. RIPK3 KO mice had reduced HMGB1
release after CCI, reduced interleukin-1 beta processing in brain tissue and endothelial cells, and maintained
K48 ubiquitination of neuronal proteins and brain TBK1 levels- mechanisms that have previously been shown
to modulate outcome after CCI and contribute to neurodegeneration in aging-related neurodegenerative
diseases. We hypothesize that RIPK3 signaling in endothelial and immune cells induces neurological
dysfunction after cerebral contusion by activating multiple acute inflammation pathways and is a potential
therapeutic target to improve outcome. To test this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: Aim 1, to
identify upstream mechanisms regulating RIPK3 activation in specific brain cell types after CCI in mice, using
immunopanning and FACS to isolate specific brain cell types; Aim 2, to define cell-specific functional roles for
RIPK3 in brain vs. peripheral immune cells using bone marrow chimeras and inducible/conditional RIPK3
knockout mice; and Aim 3, to identify mechanisms downstream of RIPK3 that might contribute to
neurodegeneration in the chronic period after TBI."
10827385,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Chemical synthesis has long benefited public health through the discovery and preparation of
pharmaceuticals, the synthesis and study of natural products, and the development of new methods for drug
delivery among many others. The continuation and acceleration of such contributions requires the
development of new chemical methods with a focus on increasing selectivity, efficiency, practicality and
scalability, and the ability to access diverse and novel chemical space. Our laboratory focuses on the creation
of new chemical methods, novel reagents, and the total synthesis of bioactive natural products. Each project
focuses on filling a key gap in the literature while delivering end products that will be of immediate and practical
use to the scientific community, both in the context of fundamental chemistry and translational drug discovery.
 This proposal combines two distinct, but thematically linked, programs that share the overarching goal
of developing novel methods and reagents to enable new chemical transformations and explore new chemical
space with direct applications to medicinal chemistry, natural product synthesis, and drug discovery. The first
section of the proposed work will develop new methods that allow for the efficient installation of sulfonimidoyl
moieties onto both simple and complex scaffolds and the use of sulfonimidoyl-containing reagents for the
syntheses of otherwise difficult-to-access chemical space including pharmaceutically relevant spirocycles and
natural products. Among the methods in this proposal are the synthesis and applications of sulfoximines as
asymmetric molecular transfer reagents, the use of sulfoximines as chiral anion stabilizing groups for anion
relay chemistry, the development of modular syntheses of sulfonimidoyl fluorides and chiral bifunctional
sulfonimidoyl linchpin reagents. In the second section, diazirines are developed as unique nitrogen transfer
reagents, which react with a wide variety of chemical handles including carboxylic acids, unactivated C–H
bonds, alcohols, and α-positions. The products of these reactions, diaziridines, are versatile heterocycles that
are easily transformed in one step to high-value amines, hydrazines, and nitrogen-containing heterocycles.
This chemistry will be applied in the target-oriented synthesis of hydrazine, hydrazide, and piperazic acid-
containing natural products, asymmetric transformations, and the synthesis of novel probes for proteomics.
The chemistry developed throughout this proposal will enhance the discovery and development of new small
molecule therapeutics across disease states in both academic and industry."
10819557,"PROJECT 1 | SUMMARY
Mechanisms underlying the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)—a normal developmental process and
an early event at the onset of epithelium-derived cancers—are minimally understood. Our findings, corroborated
by others in multiple biologically relevant models, have established mitotic gene bookmarking—occupancy of
target genes by transcription factors during mitosis—as a novel dimension to epigenetic control of lineage
commitment and cell identity. Because EMT results from loss of the epithelial phenotype, Project 1 will address
whether disruption of mitotic gene bookmarking constitutes a key mechanistic component of EMT.
Recently, we have shown that depletion of the RUNX1 transcription factor in normal mammary epithelial (NME)
cells results in EMT in both in vivo and cell-based models, indicating that RUNX1 stabilizes the normal ME
phenotype. Our preliminary data show that in ME cells undergoing mitosis, RUNX1 bookmarks genes involved
in cell proliferation, growth and maintenance of the epithelial phenotype. These findings provide the rationale for
our hypothesis that mitotic bookmarking of target genes by RUNX1 is a key epigenetic mechanism for
maintenance of the normal mammary epithelial phenotype, and perturbation of this mechanism leads to EMT.
Innovative molecular and cellular experimental strategies will be combined with state-of-the-art genomics
approaches to investigate how the RUNX1 mitotic epigenome contributes to initiation of EMT, an early event that
leads to development of breast cancer. Aim 1 will use candidate and unbiased CRISPR screens to determine
how RUNX1 bookmarked genes are physiologically linked to the mammary epithelial phenotype and whether
estrogen receptor signaling—a key determinant of NME phenotype—plays a role in regulation of RUNX1-
bookmarked genes. Aim 2 will employ Hi-ChIP and HIPMap to establish whether RUNX1 bookmarked genes
reside in same genomic neighborhoods for coordinate control. We will assess whether disruption of these
genomic regions confers EMT. Aim 3 will take advantage of degron-based RUNX1 depletion to investigate the
regulatory impact of RUNX1 mitotic bookmarking on target gene expression and maintenance of the NME
phenotype.
Project 1 studies will address significant gaps in current knowledge of the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate
EMT. Our findings will establish RUNX1 mitotic bookmarking as a unique dimension to epigenetic control of the
normal mammary epithelial phenotype, which when disrupted, results in EMT, a key early event in the
development and progression of breast cancer."
10819560,"PROJECT 2: SUMMARY
Breast cancer (BCa) ranks among the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide. Estrogen Receptor
alpha positive tumors (ER+) are the most common subtype of BCa (~70% of all cases), and are effectively
treated with anti-endocrine therapies that target ER. However, relapse frequently occurs resulting in the
development of endocrine therapy resistance (ETR) and late stage metastatic disease. Substantial evidence
indicates that transcriptional plasticity is a prominent feature of ETR, which provides subpopulations of cancer
cells with the ability to adapt to therapeutic challenges. However, the molecular regulatory networks that govern
anti-estrogen responsiveness in BCa cells remain poorly understood. It is well established that histone lysine
acetylation patterns establish cell type enhancer programs to direct BCa phenotypes. Bromodomain (BRD)
chromatin reader proteins are the primary readers of histone lysine acetylation. Despite being recognized as key
epigenetic mechanisms in cancer and emerging `druggable targets', there are large gaps in our understanding
of the functional relationships that exist between histone acetyllysine and BRDs. In addition, little is known
regarding the role of BRDs in BCa anti-estrogen responses. We have previously characterized the altered
epigenomic profiles in cell models of BCa and ETR. Our published results provide support that epigenome-wide
reprogramming of estrogen-responsive elements is linked to endocrine sensitivity and the acquisition of ETR.
Through an integrated and systematic set of specific aims, we will test the hypothesis that BRDs mediate
endocrine responsiveness in BCa. This project will specifically focus on three main aspects that might have the
potential for improved targeted therapies: The identification of specific bromodomain-containing proteins that can
be targeted to enhance cellular responses to tamoxifen in cancer treatment, determination of the contributions
of BRD-containing proteins to transcriptional plasticity during the early and late phases of ET, and
characterization of the epigenetic landscape of recurrent metastatic ER+ breast cancer to link the global
acetylome with histone binding activity of BRDs. Overall, this work will contribute to our understanding of BCa
epigenetic mechanisms and will facilitate the discovery of new biomarkers for endocrine responsiveness and the
development of new modalities for therapeutic intervention."
10819564,"SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are epigenetic regulators of the chromatin organization supporting
cancer cell activities. There is a gap in the literature identifying the chromatin interactions that establish
the phenotype of invasive breast cancer (BCa) cells. We have characterized a lncRNA, we named
MANCR (Mitotically Associated Non-Coding RNA (Tracy K Mol Can Res 2018) which is highly expressed in
aggressive triple negative and tamoxifen resistant (TAMR) BCa cell lines and increases further during
mitosis. Of clinical significance, MANCR inhibition results in cell death, thus having potential as a
therapeutic target to prevent invasive tumor growth. To reach this translational goal requires a complete
understanding of mechanisms by which MANCR is suppressed in non-malignant cells and activated in
activated in aggressive cancer cell and suppressed in normal mammary epithelial cells (NMEs). Our
findings support the hypothesis that MANCR alters the epigenetic environment via chromatin
interactions with genomic regions that support survival mechanisms in invasive breast cancer cells;
and that inhibition of MANCR will contribute to cell death and regression of tumors in vivo. The specific
aims are designed to obtain mechanistic insight at multiple levels to determine the MANCR functions
that sustain the aggressive cell phenotype. Aim1 identifies chromatin organization mediated by
MANCR’s epigenetic properties that support BCa survival by using: i) ChIRP-Seq to reveal MANCR
target gene binding sites at specific genomic locations; ii) ATAC-seq to obtain a map of accessible
chromatin regions that will identify genomic regulatory in aggressive MDA-231 cell supporting cell
survival and comparing to those domains altered by MANCR knockdown which will reveal mechanisms
resulting in cell death; iii) Capture Hi-C will discover the 3-dimensional chromatin interactions
contributing to survival of invasive BCa cells. Aim 2 focuses on mechanisms contributing to MANCR
suppression in NMEs and MCF7 ER+ BCa cells. We will i) examine if MANCR suppression is mediated
by estrogen signaling in ER+ cells, ii) examine MANCRs effect on TAMR; and iii) show that MANCR
suppression in normal mammary epithelial cells is mediated by the tumor suppressor RUNX1. Aim 3
will use two in vivo models: i) a pre-clinical xenograft mouse to demonstrate MDA-231 CRISPR inhibited
tumors in the mammary fat pad will become necrotic due to cell death; ii) resected BCa tumor tissue
that is MANCR positive to grow organoids for transplantation into mammary fat pad to determine if high
MANCR organoids have aggressive tumor growth compared to low expressing MANCR organoids.
Impact: MANCR expression correlates with poor prognosis and survival, its inhibition results in cell
death and MANCR is nearly absent from all normal tissues except testis and spleen. These properties
indicate MANCR’s potential as a therapeutic target to inhibit primary tumor growth of advanced BCa."

Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important causal factor in normal aging, and aging-related diseases such as
neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's disease, cardiac disease, cancer, diabetes and muscle

Leadership Award is to develop a world-class Center in Aging and Mitochondrial Health at UCLA to foster
research collaborations, and to educate and train the next generation of leaders in this important field. The
proposed Center will be the first of its kind at UCLA and will be led by Dr. Ming Guo. Dr. Guo is an
established physician-scientist. She is a clinical specialist on dementia and cognitive impairment, who also
investigates roles for mitochondria in aging and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s disease in research realm. The Center's goals will be addressed in three aims: 1) to develop
core resources to attract interdisciplinary investigators to engage in aging-related research and to enhance
collaborative research projects, including a major effort in Alzheimer’s disease research; 2) to create a
comprehensive interdisciplinary training and mentorship program in aging and mitochondrial biology; and 3)
to serve as a local and national resource for research on mitochondrial biology in aging. The long-term
goals of the Center will be to obtain extramural funding for multi-investigator driven proposals, as well as
career development faculty grants and an institutional training grant to sustain the training of postdoctoral
scholars and geriatric research fellows. Thus the Center will be a new initiative for UCLA and will be a
beacon of excellence for investigators pursuing research into mitochondrial biology, aging and diseases of

Though a reference human genome and even excellent characterization of the epigenome (ENCODE, Epigenetics
Roadmap, 4D Nucleome Project) has been generated, we still lack a clear understanding of how the different
facets of the epigenome collaborate to control gene expression. With the advent of affordable DNA-sequencing
technologies, methods have been developed for examining nuclear organization, protein-DNA interaction,
chromatin accessibility, and methylation state. But these methods generally interrogate only one aspect of the
epigenome at a time and reads are typically too short to provide critical correlative information. We propose the
development of a novel epigenetic characterization methodology, in this round of funding focusing on protein-
DNA interaction through leveraging the long reads and modified bases detectable with a nanopore sequencing
platform. We will enhance the signal from subtle modifications being used to profile protein-DNA interactions.
We are developing a method to insert sequence tags (nanoTUBI) near the sites of protein-DNA binding. And we
will implement these methods focusing on long read sequencing, gaining insights into long correlative
measurements and heretofore unexplored repetitive areas, phasing the entire epigenome. These tools and
analysis pipelines will grant new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation, as well as their implications for
human disease."

Glaucoma is a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, and the only treatment is to lower intraocular
pressure (IOP). IOP is governed by how aqueous humor (the fluid in the eye) exits the drainage pathways that
start at the trabecular meshwork (TM) before moving into Schlemm’s canal, collector channels, an intrascleral
venous plexus, and aqueous/episcleral veins. However, recent discoveries have demonstrated that aqueous
humor outflow (AHO) is not static and unchanging but is more complex than a simple linear depiction. AHO
shows dynamic variable behavior (or dynamic variable outflow; DVO) where it is variable with segmental
regions of the eye displaying high- or low-AHO, is dynamic where AHO can spontaneously increase or
decrease in different locations of the eye, and is improvable where drugs or surgeries can enhance it. Thus,
this proposal aims to better study DVO by uncovering how and why AHO can be improved in certain regions of
the eye. This helps understand what may have been lost in disease and what may be targeted in IOP-lowering
treatments. The central hypothesis in this proposal is that glaucoma therapies work at improvable DVO
regions and that by facilitating DVO research and knowing where and how this occurs, personalized glaucoma
treatments can be crafted for individual patients. To accomplish this, we will utilize cutting edge structural
imaging tools such as anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT). We will also use a method
called aqueous angiography that we developed on a previous National Institutes of Health and National Eye
Institute grant. Aqueous angiography allows researchers to see exactly where aqueous humor is flowing in the
eye in a real-time fashion. With these tools, we will study ex vivo human eyes in the laboratory and in donor in
vivo eyes to yield the most germane discoveries for glaucoma and glaucoma treatment. In Specific Aim (SA1),
we will discover how DVO is regulated by studying the structural and molecular basis of segmental and
dynamic AHO using imaging and screen-based tools on human donor and ex vivo eyes in the laboratory. In
SA2, we will use ex vivo human eyes to study how glaucoma surgeries in different locations in the eye impact
IOP lowering and what hurdles the proximal vs. distal AHO pathways present to surgical success. In SA3, we
will investigate how glaucoma pharmacological drugs (currently FDA-approved drug formulations and delivery)
alter DVO in ex vivo and donor eyes, specifically looking at the parts of the eye that are improved by treatment
to understand why these areas had the capacity to do so. Through the results of this proposal, we will better
understand the dynamic processes of how intraocular fluid leaves the eye as a way to enhance current
glaucoma treatments and to create a springboard to innovate new ones."

aged population, poses a significant challenge to the prevention and treatment of impairments in cognitive,
sensory, and motor functions. However, our insufficient understanding of the mechanisms underlying the
pathogenesis of many neurological diseases delays the development of effective treatments to address this
challenge. Recent advances in optogenetics have provided novel tools to investigate complex neural circuits and
brain functions. Due to a limited penetration depth of photons, however, the invasiveness of light sources into
the brain tissue of live animals to control opto-sensitive ion channels has been one of the major challenges in
optogenetics. In this regard, our goal is to develop a modular mechanoluminescent (ML) material platform for
the non-invasive, acoustic activation of various optogenetic channels for neural modulation with a high
spatiotemporal resolution. This project builds upon our recent technological achievements, in which we
developed various synthesis methods to produce novel structures of inorganic nanomaterials and high
piezoelectric organic nanofiber fragments. Based on our preliminary computational modeling, we hypothesize
that such structures enable greater effective strains that maximize the ML performance of the inorganic-organic
hybrid nanomaterials. This project aims to develop two unique optogenetic modulation systems based on ML
nanomaterials. In Aim 1, we will synthesize zinc sulfide nanoparticles doped with various metal ions to control
emission wavelengths and investigate the effect of nanoparticle morphology and dimension on ML performance.
Furthermore, the interaction between those nanoparticles and encapsulating polymer will be optimized to
maximize the ML performance of nanocomposites. In Aim 2, we will characterize the piezoelectric properties of
electrospun fiber-derived nanofragments and investigate the incorporation of ML nanoparticles into the
piezoelectric nanofragments to boost ML performance. An in vitro model based on a neural stem cell line
transduced with Channelrhodopsin-2 will be utilized to determine the performance of these ML nanomaterials
for neuromodulation. Overall, we anticipate that these studies will provide material bases for ML nanoparticles
injectable into the circulatory system (Aim 1) and for ML nanofragments injectable into a site of interest (Aim 2).
The results of this exploratory project are expected to identify candidates for ML nanomaterial platforms for
further optimization and animal testing in subsequent studies."

Pediatric chronic kidney disease (pCKD) is most commonly due to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract; thus, meaning a lifetime of disease. Children with even mild CKD are at risk for neurocognitive difficulties specific to attention regulation, academic underachievement, and executive function [1-3]. Neurocognitive deficits have broad implication on quality of life, as they contribute to poorer high school graduation rates and long-term underemployment in the adult CKD population [4]. The cognitive complications of pCKD are thought to represent sequelae of an aberrant “kidney-brain axis” whereby kidney impairment and associated disease sequelae may negatively impact the brain, leading to increased risk of cognitive impairment in the course of pCKD progression [5-7]. However, there is a critical gap in our understanding of the developing brain in the context of pCKD. Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is to quantify structural and functional brain differences using MRI and cognitive/behavioral assessments in pCKD participants with mild to moderate (early) CKD compared to unaffected controls. To our knowledge, this proposal is the first in the world to quantitatively evaluate the brain in young children with early stage pCKD due to a focused disease etiology using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Preliminary data from our laboratory are striking and demonstrate robust structural brain differences (particularly within the cerebellum) in children with congenital, non-glomerular causes of CKD compared to healthy peers. There appears to be a direct relationship between decreased cerebellum volume and impaired kidney function. Furthermore, lower cerebellum gray matter volume appears to predict performance on neurocognitive tasks specific to executive function in children with CKD. Our pilot data demonstrate abnormal resting state connectivity in pCKD whereby children with CKD show hypo-connectivity between the cerebellum (dentate nucleus) and the frontal cortices. We will investigate a “dosage” effect of disease burden on neurodevelopment in children with mild/moderate CKD. Understanding the influence of pCKD progression and severity on the developing brain will allow enhanced awareness of the role of disease progression on neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood and inform new approaches to patient care across the CKD lifespan."

professionals, public health workforce, educators, and the public in communities across the U.S., so that all
communities have equal access to the highest level of health information regardless of demographics. The nine
states of Region 4 have a number of commonalities including large rural areas with few cities, Native American
Reservations and Tribal Universities and Colleges, extensive areas lacking internet service, border regions to the
North with Canada and to the South with Mexico, many medically underserved communities and individuals
(MUC/I), and rural hospitals and clinics. Our focus on engaging with libraries and other organizations such as
public health entities and community-based organizations, as well as establishing two-way communications
throughout Region 4, will enable increased outreach, education, and funding designed to improve access to
reliable health information and data. Centrally located within Region 4, the EHSL, as part of the University of
Utah (UU), is uniquely positioned to engage successfully in the work described. As part of the UU community,
we will leverage the affiliations with our hospitals, clinics, schools, colleges, diversity officers, and teaching and
learning specialists to enhance the success of our programs nationwide. We believe that trust in NLM, NNLM,
and RML products and services can only be achieved when the communities served have an authentic and
legitimate voice in how these services are administered. Our proposal demonstrates a sustainable plan to listen
to and partner with current and future audiences throughout Region 4 and the nation to increase access to
reliable health information and improve health equity."

The COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the opioid crisis have created a pressing need for telemedicine and
consideration for use of non-pharmacological, low cost interventions as adjuvants in pain management arsenal.
We propose a project investigating neural mechanisms underlying pain reduction induced by immersive Virtual
Reality (VR). VR consists of immersion in artificial environments through the use of real-time rendering
technologies and latest generation devices. We have recently demonstrated that VR increases pain tolerance
limits and vagal activity with a parallel improvement in individual pain unpleasantness, mood, and situational
anxiety. To enhance the translatability of this project, we will directly dive into the neural mechanisms of VR in
chronic pain participants suffering from Temporomandibular Disorder(s) (TMD), a population with which the PI
and her collaborators have had fruitful results. The overarching goal is to investigate the pain modulation
mechanisms underlying VR-induced hypoalgesia by determining 1) the involvement of endogenous mu opioids,
2) the relationship between responsiveness to acute VR and long-term pain-related outcomes, and 3) the
changes in cortical excitability related to 3-week VR. We will use three main approaches: 1) a pharmacological
antagonist approach, 2) An ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for tracking dynamics of pain outcomes
over 6 months; and 3) a high-resolution electroencephalography to measure synchronization of peak alpha
frequency (PAF). We will disentangle the mechanisms of VR-induced hypoalgesia from placebo effects among
participants with distinct disabilities and grades of TMD. We expect that 1) VR, similar to placebo effects, will
reduce pain through the engagement of endogenous opioid systems, 2) VR-induced pain modulation capability
will result in better long-term pain outcomes, and 3) 3-week VR will favor a synchronization of PAF oscillations
paralleled by individual VR therapeutic benefits. This project will combine pharmacologic, the EMA, and
electroencephalographic techniques employed within TMD patients to maximize the translational value of the
resulting knowledge. The team has a history of successful collaboration and the expertise to generate innovative,
relevant, and timely findings. The successful completion of this research will generate mechanistic-based
evidence for the potential application of VR-based interventions which might empower TMD patients with new,
accessible, and affordable therapeutic solutions."
10885922,"Novel Epigenetic Marks for HIV Latency Entry and Reversal
The latent HIV reservoirs in human immunodeficiency type 1 virus (HIV) infection poses a major challenge to the
eradication of HIV. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HIV transcription is essential for
developing proper strategies to attack the latent HIV reservoirs. HIV transcription and latency are fundamentally
controlled by epigenetic regulations surrounding the chromatin proximal to HIV promoter. However, our
understanding of epigenetic regulation of HIV transcription is still incomplete. This is demonstrated by the fact
that an effective reduction of the HIV reservoir has not been achieved in HIV+ patients by the inhibition of histone
deacetylase alone or in combination with killing strategies.
We recently found that HIV was activated from latency when crotonylation is induced. This was associated with
enhanced histone crotonylation and acetylation, but reduced histone methylation at the HIV LTR. When histone
crotonylation is inhibited, latency reversal was blocked. Crotonylation induction greatly enhanced latency
reversal elicited by the activation of noncanonical NF-κB (ncNF-κB) signaling, which was mediated via the
enhancing induction of p100 cleavage into p52, one of the essential steps during ncNF-κB activation.
Transcription of HIV appears to be regulated by a network of crotonylation interactome which orchestrates an
efficient HIV transcription. These preliminary observations indicate that crotonylation- a novel and previously
unrecognized protein modification - is directly involved in HIV transcription. Of interest, the opposite may also
hold, and when crotonylation is reversed, HIV may be enforced into latency. Importantly, while crotonylation is
controlled by the same enzymes stimulating acetylation to activate gene transcription (e.g., p300), crotonylation
and its downstream signaling are regulated by distinct mechanisms. Similarly, although crotonylation is reversed
by the same enzymes regulating deacetylation to induce latency (e.g., HDACs), the mechanism of
decrotonylation signaling is different from deacetylation.
The overall objective of this R21 application is to determine the molecular mechanisms of crotonylation that
underlie the direct activation of HIV transcription and how the regulation of protein decrotonylation facilitates HIV
into latency. We hypothesize that, distinct from acetylation, protein crotonylation plays a direct role in
HIV transcription, and this can be applied to our current efforts to eliminate HIV latency, and perhaps to
future efforts to enforce HIV into latency. Our goals will be achieved through 2 specific aims, directed at the
following premises:
Aim 1: Crotonylation is distinct from acetylation and directly induces HIV transcription by effects on
epigenetics and signaling.
Aim 2: Decrotonylation suppresses HIV transcription to enforce HIV latency by direct effects at the HIV
LTR and on the cellular milieu, which is independent of deacetylation,"

Infectious diseases, including Hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV, remain important health problems among Veterans.
Development of vaccines for infectious diseases is therefore a key priority. Immunologic memory is a cardinal
feature of adaptive immunity and an important goal of vaccination strategies. Traditional vaccination strategies
are very effective at generating neutralizing antibodies, but not effective T cell memory. A key reason for the
current lack of effective vaccines against many infectious diseases is that we do not yet know how to make
vaccines that generate robust T cell memory. Thus, a fundamental understanding of how memory cells are
formed is a crucial first step in rational vaccine design for infectious diseases."
10798153,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neuronal excitability relies on the tightly regulated expression and discrete subcellular
localization of voltage-gated sodium ion channels (NaVs). These large membrane protein
complexes control the movement of sodium ions across cell membranes and are responsible for
initiating and propagating action potentials. A desire to better understand the role of NaV
subtypes in electrical signal conduction and the relationship between channel dysregulation and
specific human pathologies (e.g., arrhythmia, epilepsy, skeletal muscle disorders, neuropathic
pain) motivates the development of high precision reagents to facilitate NaV studies.
Investigations of NaV physiology are currently limited by a lack of available methods with which
to modulate the function of individual channel subtypes and to mark changes in cellular
distributions, membrane expression levels, and structural modifications (i.e., protein post-
translational modification) in live cells and in response to external cues.
We are developing small molecule probes for NaV studies based on naturally occurring bis-
guanidinium toxins, among which saxitoxin (STX) is the archetype. These agents function as
molecular ‘corks’ to occlude the extracellular mouth of the ion conductance pore, a desirable
feature for the types of tool compounds we wish to access. De novo chemical synthesis has
enabled the engineering of modified forms of STX, which we will use in combination with protein
mutagenesis and electrophysiology to investigate NaV activity on action potential dynamics.
Understanding how NaV expression is regulated and altered by extrinsic factors—glial cells,
inflammatory mediators, pH, nerve injury—and how such changes modulate action potentials is
a long-term goal of our research. To address these questions, we will develop and validate
three classes of tool compounds. These reagents will enable 1) acute, spatiotemporal inhibition
of individual NaV subtypes; 2) selective fluorescent labeling of membrane NaVs; and 3) affinity
purification of membrane NaVs for proteomics analysis. With the success of our research
program, we will deliver a unique set of high precision chemical probes to help illuminate the
complex physiology of NaVs that underlies bioelectrical signaling."

The mission of the Intermountain Doctoral Education to Advance Students (IDEAS) in Neuroscience is to build
a diverse neuroscience workforce reflecting the talent pool of a diverse local and national population. The
University of Utah is committed to fortifying, sustaining, and amplifying the STEM pipeline that trains and
launches a diverse research workforce. This postbaccalaureate training program will specifically address the
limited access to research opportunities that inhibit students from underrepresented backgrounds and small
colleges from transitioning from undergraduate to doctoral training. IDEAS in Neuroscience will recruit 4 students
per year from diverse backgrounds, with a specific focus on students from Intermountain West institutions that
serve Hispanic/Latino and Native American communities. Creating a bridge between undergraduate and
graduate training for driven, engaged students will be of significant value to both the individual student and the
larger biomedical community that will benefit from their long-term retention in biomedical research-related
careers. In order to accomplish our program mission, we will provide trainees with a (1) holistic, culturally-
competent mentored experience centered on hypothesis-driven independent research and supported with
interactive and didactic coursework ; (2) professional development and career-building activities designed to
nurture self-efficacy, scientific identity, and a sense of belonging; (3) an innovative, inclusive mentoring system
that provides career-long scientific, personal, and cultural support; and (4) coaching in selecting and preparing
applications for PhD program, refining interview skills, and effectively managing the transition to graduate school.
Throughout the training process, we employ a matrix mentoring approach that incorporates peer and near-peer
support and imbed trainees into STEM communities the provide access to diverse role-models. Our approach is
built on University-wide momentum and infrastructure dedicated to supporting STEM equity, diversity and
inclusion. The IDEAS in Neuroscience program will fortify its trainees critical thinking and research mastery while
facilitating development of the resilient mindset needed persist in graduate training and beyond."
10839305,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States.
Appropriate screening can reduce CRC mortality. Colonoscopy, a procedure to detect CRC
early, is recommended for patients with a positive fecal immunochemical test (FIT) result to
detect CRC and can even prevent CRC through the removal of pre-cancerous polyps. Rural
and low-income populations face significant barriers to colonoscopy completion after positive
FIT, including difficult access to the procedure (lack of local providers/long travel times),
socioeconomic barriers to completing the procedure (difficulty getting time off work, arranging
childcare and transportation, high out of pocket procedure costs), lack of knowledge about the
procedure and its role in CRC screening and early detection, and fear of the procedure and of
CRC. Patient navigation is an evidence-based approach to increasing colonoscopy completion.
Patient navigation provides one-on-one support to patients preparing for and completing
colonoscopy and addresses barriers through education, motivational interviewing, care
coordination and connection to community resources. The effectiveness of patient navigation
for increasing colonoscopy completion among low-income rural populations with positive FIT
has not been demonstrated. The overall objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of a
patient navigation program for increasing colonoscopy completion among rural, low-income
populations who have had a positive FIT result. The project will be implemented in partnership
with the Rural Health Council and the Washington Association for Community Health, and will
engage four rural Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). The intervention will be
evaluated in a type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study that includes a 600-patient
randomized controlled trial and comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data collection to
better understand implementation and sustainability of the program. This project is critical in
advancing our knowledge of the effectiveness of patient navigation for increasing colonoscopy
in this patient population as well as for understanding factors that can support long term
implementation and sustainability of effective interventions."

Pneumonic plague is the deadliest form of disease caused by Yersinia pestis. Early after infection, Y. pestis
subverts host innate immune mechanisms in the lung and replicates to high numbers before the onset of lethal
host inflammatory responses. As a result, pneumonic plague is difficult to treat once symptoms are recognized.
This proposal introduces the Yersinia Plasminogen activator protease (Pla) as an important mediator of early
host/pathogen interactions in the lung. Pla is well-established virulence factor known to be essential to the
pathogenesis of pneumonic plague via an unknown function. The work proposed here examines the dual role of
Pla, as both an adhesin and a protease, during pulmonary infection. The objective of this work is to define the
function of the critical Yersinia virulence factor Pla in the early events of pneumonic plague to understand how
Y. pestis resists clearance by host inflammatory responses to establish an initial replicative phase in the lungs.
The strategy for this proposal is outlined below:
Specific Aim 1. Define the role of Pla-mediated T3S during pneumonic plague. The adhesin function of Pla
facilitates targeting of alveolar macrophages for type 3 secretion (T3S) early during pneumonic plague. Aim 1
will generate and test mutants of Pla to understand how Pla mediates adherence, and characterize the
importance of Pla-mediated adherence and T3S in vivo. Further, the impact of Pla-mediated T3S on host cell
innate immune responses to T3S will be evaluated during infection to understand how Y. pestis limits host
responsiveness early during infection.
Specific Aim 2. Characterize novel proteolytic functions of Pla during pneumonic plague. Preliminary data
has identified two novel functions of Pla that may contribute to pathogenesis. A proteomics approach will be
used to identify and characterize Pla proteolytic activity early during primary pneumonic plague.
Specific Aim 3. Identify key host cell types and dynamics responsible for establishing an early pre-
inflammatory disease phase during pneumonic plague. Preliminary data indicates that deletion of Pla
disrupts the ability of Y. pestis to limit early innate immune responses in the lung. In Aim 3 we will evaluate host
cell dynamics and innate immune responses in the lung in the presence and absence of Pla to understand how
Y. pestis is able to subvert initial inflammatory responses and establish infection in the lung."

the summer following their first year to enable them to participate in an 11-week, full-time
biomedical research program supervised by vetted faculty mentors of Columbia University. Our
goal is to provide students - with and without prior research experience - an opportunity to
interact with the research faculty of this institution and to participate in a basic or clinical
biomedical research project. The program includes participation in such a project, supervised
student research presentations, a manuscript-style written report, and a seminar series that
includes topics in biomedical research concepts and techniques, as well as a module related to
Responsible Conduct of Research. A dedicated web portal communicates program information
and facilitates interactions among students and mentors.
Students who are interested in applying for this NIH Summer Research Fellowship use a web-
based system to select from a list of faculty members at the Columbia University College of
Physicians and Surgeons who have applied to serve as mentors and who have active NIH-
funded (or equivalent) grants in basic and/or clinical sciences. Students apply by submitting to
the Research Advisory Committee (RAC) of the Program a five page NIH-style application. The
applications are reviewed by members of the faculty and prioritized by the RAC. In response to
suggestions by NHLBI program personnel, we have increased our emphasis on projects related
to hematology and related stem cell biology.
To monitor the program’s relevance and impact, participants, past and present, are regularly
surveyed, using ad hoc tools and citation databases. The program’s record of accomplishment
is long and strong.
Recruitment of under-represented minorities, among mentors as well as students, is strongly
supported by an ongoing commitment of the College and by targeted efforts of the Program."
10913973,"Biological systems are inherently heterogeneous in space, dynamic in time, and complex in
nature. A grand challenge is how to study the vast number of interacting players at every relevant
length scale, ranging from protein network in protein complexes, to interacting organelles within
cells, to various cell types within tissues, and to synergistic tissues within functional organs. Hence,
the ability to simultaneously monitor a large number of interacting species inside biological
systems with sufficient spatial-temporal resolution is indispensable for characterization and
understanding of the underlying complexity.
 However, there is currently no suitable technology that can meet this grand challenge. The
prevalent “omics” technologies do not have the required spatial-temporal resolution, especially
for three-dimensional samples or living specimen. Optical microscopy can only image a few (2~5)
different targets at once, limited by the fundamental “color barrier” of fluorescence.
 To break the color barrier of light microscopy and to bridge the gap between “omics” and
imaging, here we propose a radically new technology platform. Novel vibrational spectroscopy
including electronic-pre-resonance stimulated Raman scattering (epr-SRS) and stimulated
Raman excited fluorescence (SREF) will be exploited, to achieve the most sensitive Raman
imaging to date. Our preliminary data have proved single-molecule sensitivity. We will further
develop the technique by exploring the two-dimensional excitation spectroscopy to reach ~100
colors, designing and synthesizing a library of imaging probes, opening up super-resolution super-
multiplex imaging. The imaging technology will then be implemented in several broad-impact
applications including super-multiplex tissue pathology, mapping brain-wide architecture
complexity, and super-multiparameter deep phenotyping of living cells.
 Innovations in optical microscopy have changed the way many biological problems are
addressed. Just like confocal microscopy is the work-horse in biomedical labs and two-photon
fluorescence microscopy has transformed in vivo brain imaging, we envision our newly proposed
super-multiplex spectroscopy and microscopy will break the current technical bottleneck,
revolutionize multicolor optical imaging, and become a new standard for system-wide study of
complex systems in general."

The overarching goal of my research is to define how the molecular grammar of RNA molecules regulates
gene expression. To accomplish this goal, I have pursued extensive and interdisciplinary training in the
molecular, cellular, and systems biology understanding of human RNA biology. I seek to build upon my
documented track record in RNA biology and method development to address pressing questions in RNA
biology. This proposal identifies two emphasis areas of importance for inquiry in the next five years. The first
emphasis of this proposal builds on my decade of research into the RNA–binding protein DDX3 by identifying
and exploring critical gaps in understanding. DDX3 is an essential ATP-dependent RNA–binding protein that
couples ATP binding to local RNA duplex unwinding and ribonucleoprotein remodeling. Prior work from my
group and others has implicated DDX3 in translational control for mRNA molecules containing a variety of
mRNA elements, but the precise mechanism, important mRNA features, and genetic interactions remain
incompletely understood. Here, we seek to define how DDX3 interacts with the ribosome to mediate
translational control, to use a new assay we developed to define DDX3-dependent translation in an unbiased
manner, to define how depletion of DDX3 versus missense variants differ in genetic interactions, and to
establish the mechanism leading to changes in RNA levels following DDX3 depletion. The second emphasis of
this proposal advances new developments in my group that enable single-molecule measurement of RNA-
protein interactions in cells. We evolved a new deamination-based molecular recorder to capture RNA-protein
interactions by modifying the sequence of RNA adjacent to an RNA-protein interaction. Through long-read
sequencing we can then identify regions in RNA that were bound by a protein tagged with the deaminase.
Using this approach, we find unexpected heterogeneity in RNA–binding protein sites on individual mRNA
molecules. We propose to build upon these findings, both to understand the mechanistic and functional
implications of this heterogeneity and to extend our approach to new RNA–binding proteins. Overall, the
proposed research is aligned with my research goal by defining the mechanism of important RNA–binding
proteins and by developing new approaches to measure single-molecule RNA biology. I expect the results of
the proposed research to advance the understanding of RNA biology with implications for the fundamental
understanding of RNA, human disease, and mRNA therapeutics."

10750996,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Seizure freedom is an elusive goal for the vast majority of the 1,000,000 Americans with drug-resistant
epilepsy. While the primary goal of epilepsy treatment is seizure control, this is not achievable for most patients
with drug-resistant epilepsy. Yet pursuit of seizure freedom dominates epilepsy care, often with patients
unaware of the small likelihood of seizure freedom. Moreover, providers may assume that every patient’s top
goal is seizure freedom rather than other important determinants of quality of life, such as mental health or
cognitive function. This lack of clear patient-provider communication around individual patient priorities leads to
missed opportunities to improve patient-centered outcomes for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Priority
communication tools, which elicit patient priorities and support patient-provider goal setting around those
priorities, have improved patient-centered outcomes in other clinical contexts; but no such tools exist for
patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The objective of this application is to develop a mobile health priority
communication tool for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The central hypothesis is that the priority
communication tool can enhance patient-provider communication to align care priorities and ultimately improve
clinical outcomes for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Dr. Hill’s research and training goals will be
accomplished through the following specific aims: (1) To adapt a priority communication tool to enhance
patient-provider communication during clinic visits for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, and (2) To conduct
a clinical trial to assess whether patients who receive the tablet-based waiting room priority communication tool
have improved outcomes compared to patients who do not receive the tool. Findings from this study will define
parameters for a full-scale prospective randomized controlled trial (R01) testing the intervention’s effectiveness
to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Dr. Hill has a strong
foundation in clinical epilepsy and health services research. She will develop further expertise in qualitative
data collection and analysis, stated preference methods, user-centered design of mobile health tools, and
clinical trial design. Her long-term goal is to become an independent clinician-investigator in the development
and testing of mobile health communication tools to facilitate patient-centered care and thereby improve
outcomes for neurology patients. This proposal capitalizes on the unique strengths of the University of
Michigan, the Neurology Health Services Research Program and the Institute for Healthcare Policy and

region of Southeastern Virginia. It enrolls 24,176 students (19,372 undergraduate and 4,804 graduate students)
with approximately 33% from underrepresented minority (URM) groups and 56% females. This project will
implement the NIH/NIGMS Graduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (G-RISE) program
at ODU to support graduate research training of 20 NIH-supported and 4 ODU-supported Ph.D. students over a

10774302,"early 80% of the Veterans are either overweight or obese, increasing their risk of hypertension, diabetes, and
cardiovascular disease. Accumulation of excess adiposity in this population begins at an early age, as nearly
20% of young active-duty veterans are obese, suggesting that this metabolic derangement starts early in life.
We aim to identify genetic programs induced by environmental conditions that increase veterans' susceptibility
to the development of obesity. We have collected convincing evidence suggesting that that a high incidence of
vitamin D (VD) insufficiency in young veterans and their offspring at birth could have significant long-term
consequences on their obesity risk. In mice, offspring from VD deficient dams become more obese with
increased insulin resistance (IR) and systemic inflammation by 6 weeks despite postnatal VD supplementation.
Furthermore, transplantation of fetal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from VD-deficient embryos induces
higher weight and IR in VD-sufficient recipient mice during their life suggesting the involvement of persistent
epigenetic immune cell programming. We found that in utero VD deficiency suppresses HSC Jarid2 expression
activating the Mef2/PGC1D pathway, which persists in recipient bone marrow, resulting in adipose macrophage
miR106b-5p secretion, which promotes adipose IR. It is unclear, however, if VD supplementation in utero can
prevent the onset of this epigenetic program and if this program drives adipocyte proliferation and differentiation.
Importantly, our significant findings from the VDAART randomized controlled trial study in 529 pregnant women
supplemented from the first trimester with 4000IU/d suggest that children from VD supplemented mothers have
a 10% lower BMI starting at age 4. Moreover, maternal VD supplementation decreased the projected risk of
obesity at young adult life by 15-fold, suggesting that VD supplementation early in life reduces future risk of
metabolic disease. We hypothesize that VD supplementation early in pregnancy prevents epigenetic
suppression of Jarid2 and Mef2/PGC1D activation, thereby reducing miR106b-5p secretion from myeloid cells
and preventing adipose tissue differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we propose in Aim1a to determine if early
VD supplementation in VD deficient pregnant dams prevents induction of the HSC Jarid2/PGC1D/miR106b-5p
program and the transplantation of obesity and IR by HSCs into VD sufficient recipient mice. In Aim 1b and 1c,
we will determine if Jarid2-null HSCs can transplant obesity and IR to VD-sufficient recipients and if miR106b-
null VD-deficient HSCs lack the capacity to transplant obesity and IR, respectively. In Aim 2, we will 1)
characterize the mechanisms involved in the lowering of child BMI induced by VD supplementation during early
pregnancy by obtaining in our VDAART cohort measures of the obese phenotype (fat distribution, energy
expenditure, food intake) and 2) obtain blood samples to determine if circulating miR106b-5p levels correlates
with child BMI and fat percentage and if prenatal VD supplementation prevents monocyte
Jarid2/PGC1D/miR106b-5p activation and reduces adipocyte differentiation in vitro. The results of this proposal
will provide veterans' health providers with evidence for an early screening protocol with specific biomarkers
and related pathways that identify veterans at risk of obesity and diabetes.

10765678,"Anemia is a common medical condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality,
especially if present with other diseases such as heart failure. The development of recombinant
Erythropoietin (Epo), a pro-erythrocyte hormone produced in adult kidney and liver during anemia,
revolutionized anemia treatment. Unfortunately, non-physiological bolus Epo administration also
promotes thrombosis, hypertension, and possibly cancer growth. This occurs in part because
administration of exogenous Epo lacks the normal feedback regulatory features of endogenous Epo,
which is rapidly down-regulated even before erythrocytosis is evident. Endogenous Epo production and
iron uptake are tightly controlled by the stress-responsive, heterodimeric transcription factor Hypoxia
Inducible Factor 2 (HIF-2), whose actions are regulated by oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent
post-translational modifications (PTM). The oxygen-dependent PTM include hydroxylation of prolyl
residues in specific elements of the HIF alpha proteins mediated by oxygen-dependent prolyl
hydroxylases (PHD), a family of three related proteins that exhibit differential recognition of HIF-1 and
HIF-2 alpha subunits.
Development of PHD inhibitors (PHDi) have recently come to market after a concerted
development effort over nearly two decades, but their long-term safety remains unknown. The
mechanism of action for PHDi involves stabilization and/or enhanced activity of HIF-2 signaling.
However, HIF-1 signaling is likely activated as well given the lack of complete specificity for the PHDi
as well as cross-talk that PHD proteins have for HIF themselves. Although PHDi may represent an
improvement over exogenous bolus Epo administration, PHDi treatment must still be tightly controlled
as they also lack feedback behaviors associated with control of endogenous Epo production.
Furthermore, because these agents have only recently come to the market and are being used in select
regions of the world, side effects associated with their use in real world settings are only now coming to
light. There have been case reports of increased thrombosis with their use and there is at least a
theoretical concern for development of iron overload, given that prolonged augmentation of HIF-2
signaling in the gut may also stimulate iron uptake and utilization.
In order to leverage the normal feedback regulatory features of Epo expression, we must
understand how HIF-2 signaling occurs in a dynamic and temporal sense during hypoxia. One
mechanism for enhancing HIF-2 signaling involves cyclical acetylation and deacetylation post-
translational modifications. A rate-limiting step in this process is provision of acetyl CoA for use in
acetylation of HIF-2, which is generated by the acetate-dependent acetyl CoA generator, acyl CoA
synthetase 2 (Acss2). Acss2 is active in the early phase of hypoxia when cells generate acetate in
response to this environmental stress. In this proposal, we will define the interactome surrounding
Acss2 and HIF-2 under normoxic conditions as well as under early and late hypoxia periods. We will
also determine if a rational drug therapy approach, based upon the knowledge of how HIF-2
acetylation/deacetylation is accomplished, can be used to treat mice with chronic anemia associated
with chronic kidney disease."
10757627,"ABSTRACT
 Two clinical measures are currently used to stage chronic kidney disease (CKD), the estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). The elevated morbidity and mortality risk that
is experienced by persons with CKD is overwhelmingly a result of progressive atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease (ASCVD) and heart failure (HF) rather than kidney failure. Unfortunately, eGFR and ACR inadequately
depict the kidney’s complexity because they represent glomerular function and injury respectively; yet the
kidney is predominantly comprised of tubules, and the kidney tubules are responsible for myriad homeostatic
functions that likely have more direct influence on the cardiovascular system than does damage to the
glomerulus. Moreover, pathology studies have convincingly demonstrated that tubule damage is more
prognostic for loss of kidney function than glomerular scarring.
 Novel urine measures that quantify the health of the kidney tubules have recently allowed us to define four
additional dimensions of kidney health that independently influence risk for progressive CKD: proximal tubule
injury, proximal tubule function, tubule fibrosis and repair, and tubule synthetic function. Our team has selected
eight distinct urine measures that capture each of these four dimensions and comprise the Kidney Tubule
Health Panel (KTHP). In specific, high-risk populations, the KTHP dimensions are strongly associated with risk
for ASCVD, HF and mortality; but no studies have evaluated the contributions of kidney tubule health to the
development of ASCVD and HF in the general population. Our global hypothesis is that kidney tubule damage
and dysfunction are related to the onset and progression of ASCVD and HF.
 Within two well-established, general population cohorts, CARDIA and MESA, this proposal will address the
following research questions that are critical to understanding the development of each dimension of kidney
tubule disease and their role in promoting ASCVD and HF: 1) Does kidney tubule disease develop earlier and
progress faster with advancing age than ACR and eGFR? 2) Is kidney tubule disease more severe in Black
and Hispanic persons compared with White persons? 3) Which atherosclerotic risk factors have the strongest
associations with each dimension of kidney tubule disease? 4) How strongly associated is kidney tubule
disease with several subclinical CVD measures? 5) How strongly associated are kidney tubule disease
markers with ASCVD and HF, and do they improve prediction of these endpoints? If these Aims are
successful, these easily measured, non-invasive indices of kidney tubule health may have value for population
screening, to provide insights into race/ethnic differences in kidney and cardiovascular disease, and to
identifying pathways for novel therapeutics that target kidney tubules, such as the SGLT2 inhibitors and the
non-steroidal aldosterone antagonists, that reduce risk for both kidney and cardiovascular adverse outcomes."
10849669,"While current ART has prevented AIDS and reduced HIV-related morbidities and mortality for the majority
of infected individuals, a therapeutic regimen able to eradicate or functionally cure HIV infection does not
exist. Persistence of HIV in a small pool of latently infected cells remains the major obstacle for HIV
eradication largely because the mechanisms that underlie viral persistence are still unknown. Our group
has generated significant and convincing results in cART treated HIV infected humans and SIV infected
rhesus macaques (RMs) suggesting that Interleukin(IL)-10 plays an important role in the establishment and
maintenance of the HIV reservoir by (i) impeding the early antiviral innate and the HIV/SIV specific adaptive
immune response and (ii) promoting the differentiation of Tfh and Tr1 cells that are major HIV/SIV
reservoirs. The importance of IL-10 in the establishment and maintenance of HIV has prompted Merck to
successfully develop a Rhesus form of an anti-human IL-10 Ab that is currently being tested in clinic;
administration of this Ab in a proof of concept study to SIV infected RMs was safe and well tolerated; it also
recapitulated several of the biological activities of the human Ab as it showed a negative impact on Tfh
frequencies which could translate in a smaller reservoir. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that
neutralization of IL-10 activity systemically and in lymphoid tissues will lead to restoration of cellular
immune responses, decreased Tfh and Tr1 numbers, and a decay in HIV reservoir. Biomarkers that predict
successful clinical interventions involving anti-IL-10 and leading to HIV eradication are not available. In Aim
1, we will perform an unbiased OMICs integrated approach to identify cell subsets, soluble effector
molecules, metabolites and molecular pathways, which underlie the modulation of HIV reservoirs by IL-10
in cell subsets isolated from PBMCs and tissues from cART treated HIV infected subjects. We will identify
markers that are associated to low levels of IL-10 and conversely to lower HIV reservoir in Tfh and Tr1 cells
and efficient innate antiviral and cell mediated immunity. These markers will be used to monitor the impact
of the anti-IL-10 intervention that aims at restoring innate antiviral immunity and cell mediated immunity for
HIV eradication. Direct demonstration that IL-10 regulates HIV persistence will be provided by examining
the impact of IL-10 blockade on virus persistence in a large study of ART-treated, SIV-infected RMs.
Preclinical trial of Aim 2 will allow us to determine the restoration of innate immunity by early IL-10 blockade
as this intervention should inhibit the upregulation of NLRX-1, a molecule we have shown to play a critical
role in the early HIV/SIV dissemination and conversely in the seeding of the HIV/SIV reservoir. Pre-clinical
trial of Aim 3 should allow the restoration of the adaptive immune response by preventing the development
of IL-10 producing Tr1 cells; IL-10 blockade will also trigger the HIV/SIV reservoir decay in Tfh cells which
depend on IL-10 for their survival and differentiation. Achievement of these goals will lead to the
development of a much-needed strategy aimed at eradicating HIV.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
HIV eradication have become a realistic possibility as was shown by the Berlin patient who was cured of
HIV by bone marrow transplantation of cells that cannot be infected by HIV. Therapeutic interventions
which are less invasive must be explored and tested. We present here a novel strategy that targets IL-10, a
cytokine that enhances the number of cells that can become reservoirs for HIV and inhibits antiviral
immune responses. We expect that our approach will restore immune responses and decrease the
reservoir size, thus promoting HIV remission."
10796918,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Modern multimodal biomedical imaging data have the potential to advance our ability to diagnose
medical conditions and to understand the biological mechanisms underlying disease progression.
However, these data typically display non-linear geometric structure, i.e., manifold structure, which
limits the applicability of classical statistical methods to gain further knowledge from the analysis of
the contemporary biomedical datasets. This project will focus on the development of novel
statistical methods for the analysis of biomedical images with manifold structure that are subject-
specific anatomical objects coupled with ‘signals' that are structural or functional images. Examples
of such data are fMRI signals, seed-based connectivity maps, or cortical thickness measurements
located on the highly convoluted subject-specific cortical surfaces. The proposed methods will
model these data as ‘functional data', i.e., without relying on oversimplified representations that
could lead to the loss of relevant biological information. In practice, the proposed framework will
allow researchers to relate anatomical, structural, and functional imaging features to other
variables typically collected, such as disease status, treatment type, or genetic information, with
the aim of validating scientific hypotheses or discovering novel imaging biomarkers. The models
developed will be made available as free and open-source tools that can easily interface with the
most popular data analysis software for them to become part of the larger imaging software
ecosystem."

Women with a family history and/or genetic predisposition for breast cancer (BC) can face significantly
elevated lifetime BC risk, but the cancer risk management options (i.e., surveillance routines, preventive
surgeries, and medications) that are shown to reduce risk and enable early detection are used by only a small
proportion of women for whom they are recommended. There is a critical need to develop evidence-based
strategies to improve the standard of care for high-risk women. Population-based screening programs, usually
facilitated through screening mammography services, offer significant promise of identifying most high-risk
women. Effectively reducing BC morbidity and mortality, however, also requires additional steps to
communicate personalized risk information and risk-management options; connect women with healthcare
providers capable of explaining risk, its consequences, and risk-management options; support risk-related
decision making; and facilitate risk-management decisions and behavior. Prior research has illuminated (a) a
staged pathway along which high-risk women adopt risk-management behavior and (b) eight main facilitators
(related to information, support, beliefs, access to care, and resolution of practical barriers) that help advance
women along the risk-management adoption pathway (R-MAP). In addition, survey-based studies have
demonstrated that the majority of high-risk women experience significant gaps in access to these facilitators,
and that these gaps are particularly acute among Black women. The goal of the proposed study is to design,
develop, and test a multi-dimensional patient navigation (PN) intervention to advance high-risk women along
the risk-management adoption pathway by addressing the eight main facilitators of risk-management behavior.
Aim 1: Determine the specific information, types of support, barrier reductions, and provider referrals that
would advance women at high risk of BC along the pathway toward risk-management adoption, using semi-
structured interviews with high-risk Black and White women. Aim 2: Develop a multi-dimensional PN
intervention to advance high-risk women along the risk-management adoption pathway, guided by data
generated in Aim 1 and a panel composed of experts and patient representatives. Aim 3: Test the feasibility of
the PN intervention and of recruiting to a participants to a randomized controlled trial of the intervention.
Seventy-five participants identified after a screening mammogram as potentially at high BC risk will be
randomized to PN-intervention or information-only conditions in a 2:1 ratio. Baseline surveys and final surveys
after eight months will be used to assess the primary hypothesis that most intervention-arm participants will be
satisfied with the PN intervention, and to check several other benchmarks of feasibility. We will also
descriptively estimate progress along the R-MAP and other outcomes, to appropriately power a randomized
controlled trial (RCT) to come. This research will set the stage for a full-scale RCT of this innovative
intervention with racially and socioeconomically diverse populations, and ultimately contribute to cancer
prevention and control among high-risk women."
10796865,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Trauma-induced acute respiratory dysfunction syndrome (ARDS) is a deadly condition in which lung failure
results from a traumatic injury to another part of the body. Recently, several studies have established a link
between circulating histones and lung failure. Traumatic injuries cause a massive amount of cell death,
resulting in the release of high concentrations of histones into circulation, which can directly lead to ARDS, as
histones damage the lungs. In addition, circulating histones exacerbate exaggerated pro- and anti-
inflammatory responses that also result in damage to the lungs and other organs. Identification and
quantification of trauma-triggered circulating histones would provide an approach to assess the risk of ARDS,
which could enable life-saving therapies before a patient develops ARDS. Diagnostic solutions to provide early
detection of histones following trauma should be portable and rapid in order to assess the patient soon after
the injury occurs. Currently, however, there are no portable and rapid approaches that enable detection of
circulating histones to assess a trauma patient’s risk of developing ARDS. Our goal is to develop a diagnostic
tool that is capable of quantitatively assessing the risk of trauma-induced ARDS at the point of care. This may
include at the point of injury, in the transport vehicle to a trauma center, in the Emergency Department (ED), or
in the operating room (OR). We have invented a Portable Histone Assay Technology (PHAST) that can
quantify circulating histones directly from whole blood within 30 minutes.

Disruption of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is associated with the development of
biochemical alterations that typically affect tissues with a high energy demand, particularly skeletal and cardiac
muscle. An inherited autosomal recessive skeletal myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been linked
to loss of function of a nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial protein, due to a frameshift mutation in solute
carrier family 25, member 4 (SLC25A4; c.523delC, p.Q175RfxX38). SLC25A4 encodes the heart-muscle
isoform of the adenine nucleotide translocator-1 (ANT1, SLC25A4), which in the wild-type state is a critical
component of mitochondrial metabolism. Patients with SLC25A4 deficiency display lactic acidosis, persistent
adrenergic activation, and exertional intolerance secondary to both a general skeletal muscle myopathy as well
as a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Ultimately, myocardial thickening and cardiac dysfunction progress to end-
stage heart failure necessitating cardiac transplantation.
There are not currently any disease-modifying therapies available for this patient cohort. However, adeno-
associated viral (AAV) mediated gene replacement therapies have emerged as a powerful strategy for disease
modification of inherited monogenic disorders. The long-term goal of our research is to develop a therapeutic
gene replacement strategy to treat SLC25A4 deficiency. The objective of this proposal is to further characterize
the disease phenotype as well as to synthesize and evaluate the efficacy of a recombinant AAV (rAAV) vector
in an in vitro model of patient-derived cell lines and organoid models. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that AAV-mediated gene replacement can ameliorate the biochemical and functional effects
of SLC25A4 deficiency and can more decisively prevent disease progression. The specific aims of this
proposal are:
 1. Characterize the SLC25A4 deficiency phenotype in patient-derived cell lines.
 2. Synthesize a recombinant AAV vector for delivery of codon-optimized SLC25A4 cDNA to
 skeletal and cardiac myocytes.
 3. Evaluate the efficacy of AAV-SLC25A4 viral transduction in patient-derived cell lines.
These experiments will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying SLC25A4
deficiency as well as allow us to evaluate the efficacy of an AAV platform in a relevant preclinical model.
Moreover, the skills I will acquire during this fellowship will help to establish me as an independent investigator
and a surgeon-scientist focused on the development of translational gene replacement therapies."
10737617,"An experimental study of the effects of alcohol intake on subsequent binge eating among adults with
 clinically significant binge eating
One potential maintenance factor of binge eating (i.e., the subjective experience of loss of control over eating)
noted in the literature is alcohol consumption. Alcohol use, even at moderate levels, may increase likelihood for
subsequent binge eating episodes due to its impact on stimulating appetite and increasing disinhibition. While
cross-sectional retrospective research supports that individuals who drink more generally also engage in more
frequent binge eating, no study to date has experimentally tested whether consuming a moderate amount of
alcohol increases risk for a subsequent binge eating episode. Current treatment recommendations regarding
alcohol use in individuals with binge eating do not give guidance on whether alcohol use should be modified
and for whom these recommendations should be provided. In particular, there is reason to hypothesize that
individuals with low self-regulation, more severe eating disorder symptoms, or less frequent/heavy alcohol
consumption are at a higher risk for binge eating after drinking a moderate amount of alcohol. Given the high
prevalence of alcohol use among individuals with binge eating, determining whether moderate alcohol
consumption increases risk for subsequent binge eating is crucial for providing tailored evidence-based
treatment recommendations regarding alcohol use. The current study will use a repeated measures
experimental design to test the acute effect of alcohol on binge eating features (i.e., urges to binge eat, loss of
control, calorie consumption) among adults with clinically significant binge eating (N = 60). Participants will
complete physiological measures of self-regulation (i.e., heart rate variability) and clinical interviews of eating
disorder symptoms and alcohol use patterns. In two counterbalanced study sessions, participants will receive a
moderate dose of alcohol (blood alcohol concentration of 0.08%) or a non-alcoholic placebo before being
provided an ad-libitum test meal. Ratings of urges to binge eat and loss of control, as well as calorie
consumption, will be measured following the test meal. The aims of the study are to test if: (1) alcohol intake
will be a stronger predictor of binge eating features than the placebo, and (2) individuals with low self-
regulation (i.e., low heart rate variability) will endorse more binge eating features than those with high self-
regulation. Secondary aims are to test the moderating effects of eating disorder symptoms and alcohol use
patterns. This study will contribute significantly to the eating disorder field’s knowledge about the role of alcohol
in the maintenance of binge eating. Additionally, completion of the current project will facilitate the applicant’s
training in (1) experimental study designs in alcohol research, (2) lab-based measures of binge eating, (3) data
collection and analysis of heart rate variability data, and (4) professional development. As such, the current
project is an important and necessary step for the applicant to achieve their professional goals of an
independent academic research career studying the effect of alcohol and substances on eating disorder
maintenance and treatment."
10758598,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often considered to be a disorder in children and
adolescents, but is, in fact, diagnosed in 2.5% of adults as well. A main behavioral correlate of ADHD is the
claimed increase in susceptibility to interference from irrelevant external sources. A prevailing view in the
literature is that deficits in executive functions, especially control over interference, underlie ADHD symptoms
(e.g., Barkley, 1997; Pennington & Ozonoff, 1996). Interference control is the ability to prevent interference due
to resource or stimulus competition (Nigg, 2000). However, despite 20 years of research, empirical evidence
for impaired interference control in ADHD patients remains inconclusive using model tasks such as the Simon
task and the flanker task. This may be related to methodological issues that are present in such tasks that are
typically used to assess interference control. The current application is based on a new approach to study
interference control that can avoid these issues. The approach makes use of a “forced-response” method in
which individuals’ responses in conflict tasks are required at a fixed time. This fixed time occurs at a variable
time after the presentation of the imperative stimulus to which individuals must make a response, making it
possible to capture responses at various points in the processing stream. The application includes experiments
using this new approach, and it offers a computational framework to understand how interference control in
ADHD individuals may be compromised compared to healthy individuals."

Assembly-line polyketide synthases (PKSs) are enzyme machines that catalyze vectorial biosynthesis of a
growing polyketide chain through a uniquely defined sequence of acyl carrier protein and ketosynthase
domains involving alternating chain translocation and elongation reactions. Notwithstanding the discovery of
>3000 naturally occurring assembly-line PKSs, we do not understand how they blend catalytic specificity with
evolutionary flexibility. Our lab is motivated by the goal of understanding the enzymology and evolution of
assembly-line PKSs while enhancing our ability to engineer known PKSs and decode “orphan” ones.
Our Goals for the next five years are to:
1) Understand the chemical logic of vectorial biosynthesis by an assembly-line PKS: We will study: (i) the
structural dynamics of individual PKS modules; (ii) how different conformations of a module enable its
elementary reactions; and (iii) the extent to which transitions between successive reactions are coordinated
across an assembly line. Our proposed mechanistic investigations will exploit: (i) our ability to functionally
reconstitute PKSs in vitro; (ii) epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies to trap individual PKS modules in
specific conformational or catalytic states; and (iii) advances in X-ray, SAXS, and cryoEM analysis of PKSs.
2) De-orphanize the nocardiosis-associated NOCAP synthase: We have de-orphanized the nonamodular
NOCAP synthase found in isolates of Nocardia associated with nocardiosis. Now, we propose to solve the
structure of the fully tailored natural product, and to elucidate its biological role in nocardiosis. This will require
us to: (i) characterize a putatively doubly glycosylated polyketide product; (ii) establish a phenotypic assay for
its bioactivity in a macrophage-like human cell line; and (ii) harness genome-wide CRISPR knockout and
shRNA knockdown screens to gain insight into its mode of action.
3) Decipher the role of GRINS in the evolution of assembly-line PKSs: We have discovered a new genetic
element, named GRINS (genetic repeats of intense nucleotide skews), that is widespread in assembly-line
PKS genes. We hypothesize that GRINS play a major role in diversifying assembly-line PKSs. To test this
hypothesis, we will: (i) identify candidate genes in Streptomyces that are involved in introducing nucleotide
skews or enabling gene conversion; (ii) identify a bacterial host in which gene conversion is enabled by GRINS
under laboratory conditions; and (iii) develop an experimental model for GRINS-based PKS engineering.
The significance of our proposal is two-fold. On one hand, it offers the opportunity to break new ground in our
understanding of the structure, mechanism, and evolution of assembly-line PKSs. On the other hand, it tests
the extent to which our understanding of these remarkable megasynthases can be harnessed to discover
novel bioactive polyketides from “orphan” assembly-line PKSs."
10840810,"Most spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) make afferent synapses on the auditory sensory cells, the inner hair cells
(IHCs), and convey auditory information to the brain. Noise damages cochlear afferent synapses even at
sound levels too low to destroy hair cells. Noise-induced cochlear “synaptopathy” (NICS) is detectable by
histological examination and counting of synapses and is also evident, noninvasively, as reduced auditory
brainstem response (ABR) wave I amplitude. While synaptopathy does not detectably affect auditory
thresholds, it may cause hearing impairments such as poorer speech-in-noise performance or tinnitus. In the
course of investigating means to prevent NICS, we observed that female mice are significantly less susceptible
than are males to NICS. Remarkably, female susceptibility varies with estrous cycle phase, with lowest
susceptibility correlated with the estrous phase at which progesterone (P4) levels are highest (and estrogen
lowest). In vitro experiments additionally show that a high level of P4 promotes rapid regeneration of synapses.
These data showing sex differences in synaptopathy are the first to show that susceptibility varies through the
estrous cycle and to show a protective role for P4. To follow up, our first aim is to determine whether a high
level of steroid sex hormone does reduce NICS. To that end, we will experimentally manipulate levels of P4
and estrogen in male and female mice. We have further shown that, not only P4 but also the neurotrophic
factor CNTF and agents that activate cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling promote synaptic regeneration. The latter
include compounds, such as rolipram, that can be administered systemically. P4, CNTF, and rolipram
represent excellent reagents for investigating the role in vivo of cAMP in synapse regeneration and may also
be candidate therapeutics for post-noise synapse regeneration therapy. However, cochlear synapses may lose
their capacity for regeneration with time after damage and the timecourse may differ among the different
agents promoting regeneration. Our second aim will determine how long after noise these agents, P4, CNTF,
or cAMP, may be administered and still promote regeneration. Unlike the case for peptide neurotrophic factors,
the molecular and cellular mechanism(s) by which progesterone or cAMP promote synapse regeneration
remain obscure. Our third aim asks whether these factors function via genomic actions or via cytoplasmic
targets or plasma membrane receptors – a necessary preliminary step for future detailed mechanistic studies
of signaling pathways and possible transcriptome changes involved. For cAMP, the question is whether cAMP-
dependent protein kinase enters the nucleus or remains a cytoplasmic signal, a question we successfully
answered previously with respect to survival signaling. For progesterone, our preliminary studies suggest that
a nuclear receptor is not involved so our focus will be on plasma membrane progesterone receptors."

The field of epidemiology has gained increasing prominence in the research community and became a
household word in 2020. Epidemiology provides the tools to uncover the underlying causes of human illness
and to, in turn, inform clinical practice and preventive strategies, advise policy and regulatory actions, and
move scientific advancements forward. In Phases I and II, our Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence
(COBRE) Center for Molecular Epidemiology at Dartmouth has effectively advanced research in the field. As
the only Center for molecular epidemiology in northern New England and one of the only COBRE programs
with this focus nationally, we have successfully recruited and mentored the next generation of independent
early career investigators. We further supported established investigators to enlarge their research programs,
form new collaborations and integrate the latest biomedical discoveries, innovations, and methods. In doing so,
we dramatically grew our research productivity and grant portfolio, as evidenced by the steep rise in the
number of publications, presentations, and grants awarded since the inception of our COBRE Center. As part
of achieving sustainability, we formed a new Department of Epidemiology and developed innovative cross-
disciplinary training grants.
Our cohesive Center brings together talented investigators focusing on 1) applying new scientific discoveries
and technologies to address major human health concerns, 2) identifying early indicators of disease
pathogenesis, and 3) exploring common pathways of disease etiology and progression in human populations,
including those related to health inequities. In this Phase III application, we will progress our molecular
epidemiology research infrastructure forward to full independence and sustainability. Specifically, we will 1)
evolve a state-of-the-art Biorepository and Biospecimen Resource Facility Core that supplies the critical
services responsive to the ongoing and future needs of biomedical scientists, 2) expand the pipeline of
talented, diverse molecular epidemiologists, and provide the requisite mentorship, career development, and
research resources to cultivate cutting-edge research and make investigators competitive for NIH funding, and
3) enhance the governance structure, implementation approaches, stakeholder engagement, and evaluation
that will strengthen our Center’s impact, promote its strategic vision, and forge ties with regional and national
partners. Our success in Phases I and II, combined with strong institutional support, positions us to serve as a
vital resource in molecular epidemiology for Northern New England, for COBRE and IDeA Networks of
Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) programs, and more broadly."

Mitochondria are central intracellular organelles that mediate metabolism and ATP production. In order to
maintain the function of mitochondria during stress, cardiomyocytes (CMs) have multiple layers of quality
control mechanisms mediating mitochondrial fission/fusion, degradation and biogenesis. Mitophagy, a
mitochondria-selective form of autophagy, is a major mechanism of degradation of damaged mitochondria and
protects the heart against heart failure. In general, mitophagy is induced by the same molecular mechanisms
commonly used by general autophagy, including “autophagy-related” (Atg) molecules, and additional
molecules, including Pink1/Parkin. However, increasing lines of evidence suggest that mitophagy is also
induced independently of conventional autophagy. During the past funding cycle, we have shown that an
unconventional form of mitophagy plays a more critical role in protecting the heart during ischemia than the
conventional form of mitophagy. This unconventional form of mitophagy, called alternative mitophagy, utilizes
molecular machinery distinct from that used by conventional mitophagy, namely the Ulk1-Rab9-Rip1-Drp1
protein complex. Currently, the functional significance and the molecular mechanisms of alternative mitophagy
remain poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the functional significance of alternative
mitophagy in the heart during chronic and more pathologically relevant conditions in vivo, elucidate the
underlying molecular mechanisms, and eventually apply our knowledge to treat heart disease by stimulating
alternative mitophagy. Interestingly, although conventional autophagy and mitophagy are activated in response
to high fat diet (HFD) consumption in the mouse model of diabetic cardiomyopathy, their activation is transient
and they protect the heart only during the early phase of HFD consumption. On the other hand, an
unconventional form of mitophagy is activated in a more prolonged manner and appears to play an essential
role in protecting the heart during the chronic phase of HFD consumption. We here hypothesize that
alternative mitophagy is the predominant form of mitophagy in the heart during the chronic phase of
HFD consumption and plays an essential role in protecting the heart against diabetic cardiomyopathy.
Alternative mitophagy is activated through a TFE3-dependent transcriptional program and the direct
association of a large protein complex, containing Drp1 and Drp1 interacting proteins, with
mitochondria. We will test our hypothesis using unique indicators of mitophagy, genetically altered mouse
models, morphological analyses, including immunogold analyses, lipidomics, transcriptome analyses, and
ChIP-sequencing analyses. Our study will demonstrate a novel and targetable mitochondrial quality control
mechanism during the chronic development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Our study should lead to the
development of novel interventions to maintain the quality of mitochondria in diabetic patients and alleviate
their cardiac complications, including cardiac hypertrophy/dysfunction, lipotoxicity, and inflammation."

Despite the efficacy and clinical benefits of effective ART, a reservoir of cells harboring replication-competent
(intact) proviruses usually leads to viral rebound within weeks of stopping ART. Although this HIV reservoir is
generally considered to be latent, sensitive PCR-based single copy HIV RNA assays have revealed low-level
viremia in individuals on ART, indicating that latency is not absolute. Several groups including ours have shown
that the HIV reservoir is maintained by the proliferation of infected cells carrying replication-competent (intact)
proviruses (termed repliclones). Previously we reported that low-level persistent viremia on ART can originate
from large clones carrying intact proviruses (Simonetti, et al. PNAS 2016; Halvas, et al. J Clin Invest 2020). This
important finding raises the question of how repliclones escape immune clearance mechanisms despite proviral
expression as evidenced by virion production and viremia. We postulate that one or more possible mechanisms
may be involved that will be investigated in three Specific Aims of the current proposal. These mechanisms
include: i) transcriptional silence (latency) of most proviruses in a repliclone; ii) dysfunctional immune responses
that fail to mediate repliclone killing; iii) mutated proviruses in repliclones that escape CTL or antibody-mediated
effector functions; and iv) intrinsic resistance of the repliclone cells to CD8+ T-cell- and/or NK cell-mediated
killing. In Aim 1, we will characterize repliclones in 10-15 donors on effective ART (Aim 1A), and then quantify
the fraction of proviruses in each clone that are expressing unspliced and single spliced (env) HIV mRNA by our
recently reported cell-associated HIV RNA and DNA single genome sequencing method (Aim 1B). In Aim 2, we
will evaluate three possible mechanisms by which transcriptionally active repliclones evade clearance by CD8+
T-cells. These evaluations will include: i) assessing epitope escape of repliclone proviruses (Aim 2A.1), ii)
evaluating ex vivo cytotoxic activity of autologous T-cell responses with confirmed ability to recognize cells
infected with repliclone virus (Aim 2A.2) and iii) directly determining whether cells comprising repliclones are
inherently resistant to CD8+ T-cell-mediated killing (Aim 2B). In Aim 3, we will evaluate the neutralization
sensitivity of viruses from individual repliclones to autologous and broadly-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
(Aim 3A), and the killing of repliclones by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic (ADCC) (Aim 3B). We will
leverage a suite of novel tools already developed to detect repliclones, examine proviral expression in single
repliclone cells, detect humoral and cellular immune escape variants, and assess the sensitivity of repliclones to
killing by autologous virus-specific CD8+ T-cell clones or by ADCC. The work will be carried out by an ongoing,
productive, and complementary collaboration between the Halvas and Mellors virology laboratories at the
University of Pittsburgh and the Jones immunology laboratory at Weill Cornell Medicine. Insights gained from
this work will be broadly applicable to developing therapeutic approaches for eliminating the persistent, clonally
expanded HIV reservoir, the main barrier to curing HIV infection."

Although we are not yet in a position to estimate the total collateral damage to health and society due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, widespread increases in stress, financial strain, depression/anxiety, family conflict, and
social isolation during the pandemic may each have large and cumulative long-term impacts on physical
health, particular via cardiovascular disease (CVD). For example, given that evidence from a large recent
meta-analysis indicates that risk for stroke and ischemic heart disease is about 30% higher in lonely and
socially isolated people, the CVD-related “consequences of social distancing may be profound”. Pandemic-
related stressors, such as financial strain and social distancing, may be particularly difficult for families with
young children. In this context, the proposed project is uniquely positioned to examine important theoretical
and practical public health questions that will inform future efforts to minimize the negative collateral health
impacts of infectious disease epidemics as well as other crises: To what extent did the COVID-19 pandemic
increase CVD risk among parents and children? Which of the multiple stressors associated with such a crisis ̶
e.g., financial, mental health, social isolation, family conflict ̶were most strongly linked to increases in CVD
risk among parents and children? Can universal prevention programming enhance parent and child resilience
in order to protect against crisis-related stressors and mitigate crisis-related increases in CVD risk?
Aim 1: To examine the magnitude of change in CVD risk (a) from pre-pandemic to a time point near the
anticipated end of the pandemic (“post-pandemic”) and (b) from the “post-pandemic” time point to 18 months
later. We will assess whether pandemic-period financial strain, mental health problems, and family conflict
predict CVD risk changes. Aim 2. To examine whether random assignment to effective family prevention is
associated with (a) a reduction in the hypothesized increase in CVD risk across the pandemic; (b) greater
“recovery” in CVD health indicators over an 18 month period during which we expect most pandemic-related
restrictions will have been eased; and (c) reduced associations between pandemic-related stressors and
change in CVD risk (moderation). Aim 3: To examine whether gender or pre-pandemic indicators of
socioeconomic status (income, education) moderate the associations examined in Aims 1 and 2.
Impact. This project will result in new practical and theoretical knowledge that is important as we face
increased frequency of infectious disease epidemics and climate change-related environmental disasters.
Research that increases understanding of the stress-related processes within families that impact CVD health
risk will inform future intervention approaches to reduce CVD risk during periods of family crisis, social-
economic dislocation, and natural disasters. Understanding the factors that relate to risk and resilience will
allow program developers to more precisely target salient mechanisms as well as families at highest risk."

for these children. Whole exome sequencing has radically changed our approach to VEO-IBD, however, it has
only been successful in ~18% of cases, despite evidence highly suggestive of an underlying genetic defect. In
addition, linking the identified variant to the development of the VEO-IBD phenotype remains difficult.
The goal of this proposal is to widen our genetic analysis through whole genome sequencing (WGS) and
leverage transcriptome modifications to enhance our capacity in identifying causal variants. Our central
hypothesis is that a proportion of VEO-IBD is a monogenic disease, a subset of which will alter gene transcription,
and transcriptome analysis, including single cell analysis, will allow us to more rapidly and accurately identify
such mutations among the detected candidate variants. Using a novel innovative method, based on WGS, we
will expand our repertoire of causal defects in VEO-IBD. We will integrate these findings with RNA-seq and
scRNA-seq data, which can generate a more sensitive and specific approach to detect causal variants and
characterize their mechanism of action. In addition, when WGS cannot identify a clear causal variant, RNA-seq
and scRNA-seq can provide insight into the underlying disease mechanism, supporting the implication of
candidate mutations.
To test our central hypothesis, in Specific Aim 1 we will expand our dataset of potential causal mutations in VEO-
IBD through WGS. We will validate candidate genes in additional VEO-IBD cases. In Specific Aim 2, we will test
the ability of transcriptional profiling of colonic tissue and PBMCs to enhance the identification of novel causal
variants of VEO-IBD. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, using scRNA sequencing, we will assess the colonic and immune
cell heterogeneity and characterize genes and pathways associated with infantile onset IBD using transcriptional
profiling of individual cells from colonic tissue and PBMCs.
Completion of this project will result in the identification of novel genetic causes of VEO-IBD, providing a fertile
source of biologic processes to pursue to better understand the basic mechanisms of disease, with the ultimate
goal of translating this knowledge into improved care for children with VEO-IBD through individualized and
targeted therapy."

The γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor is an ionotropic inhibitory ion channel. Inhibition mediated by
GABAA receptors sets the level of activity in the brain, whereas in individual cells it determines the propensity
of a cell to fire an action potential in response to excitatory input. The GABAA receptor is a major target for
intravenous anesthetics and numerous endogenous compounds including neuroactive steroids. This project
will investigate how combinations of endogenous and clinical compounds affect the functioning of the native
GABAA receptor, and initiate the onset and offset of anesthesia. Specifically, we will: i) explore the kinetic and
energetic aspects of activation and modulation of native synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors by
clinically-relevant compounds; ii) determine the involvement of endogenous neurosteroids in the clinical actions
of intravenous anesthetics to test the hypothesis that normal physiological changes in steroid levels modify
responses to anesthetics; iii) probe ways for controllable recovery from anesthesia; and iv) test the feasibility of
using partial allosteric agonists of the GABAA receptor as safe, mild sedatives."
10619124,"I recently developed a programmable phage display for identifying pathogenic antigens related to human paraneoplastic neurological disorders (PNDs). This workplace me in the rapidly emerging area of neuro- immunology, as PNDs are debilitating central nervous system disorders that involve autoimmune encephalitis. Patients with PND harbor autoantibodies against brain antigens, and specificity in the autoantibody profile predicts clinical symptoms and prognosis. I have characterized the largest set of antigens that are linked specifically to patient PNDs, one of which, KLHL11, was novel and published recently. In Aim 1, I will characterize the additional antigens and test my hypothesis that a single epitope is causal to PND patient autoimmunity and encephalitis. The K99 will allow me to acquire the advanced bioinformatics skills necessary for epitope analysis, strengths of the mentor's lab. In Aim 2, I test whether intracellular PND antigens cause autoimmune encephalitis through a non-canonical MHC-I class-dependent pathway, an unexpected mechanism with implications for treatment. I will create a new mouse model for anti-KLHL11 PND and a complementary KLHL11 knockout mouse. Together with existing mice deleted in immunity genes, I will use immunohistochemistry (IHC) and single cell sequencing to test dependence in specific targeting of T-cells in the brain of PND on the non-canonical MHC pathway. The K99 will allow me, with classes and advisors, to acquire the necessary advanced knowledge in immunology built into Aims 2 and 3 and help guide the initial T cell studies. Further, the UCSF mission, including infrastructure and research environment, is geared particularly towards facilitating direct interactions between basic and clinical immunologists and neurologists. I plan to continue to exploit this specialized environment as I transition to the R00 phase in this aim. In Aim 3, I bring to bear my previous expertise in mouse genetics and cellular neurobiology, and my K99 acquired molecular immunology expertise, to leverage PND antigens (Aims 1 and 2) to generate 3D anatomical maps of targeted inflammation in the brain. I will test whether brain region-specific PND encephalitis is mediated by the CNS lymphatic system. IHC with brain clearing for T cells, at different times after initiation of PND, will provide a comprehensive “3D” roadmap of the invading T cells and their relationship to antigen-expressing cells. My proposed studies will result in a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms determining how neuronal antigens elicit a brain autoimmune response, and assuming T cell migration routes are specific for anatomically distinct auto immunities, pave the way for identifying neuronal circuitries underlying the distinct PND pathologies, my goal as an independent investigator."
10620287,"ABSTRACT
While proper diagnosis is key to effective TB treatment, there exist specific barriers to TB testing in low resource
settings, especially for children. While a number of TB diagnostic tools are available, they each suffer from critical
drawbacks (difficult, inaccurate, expensive) that limit their widespread implementation in low resource settings
and their feasibility in children. A mycobacterial cell wall glycolipid, lipoarabinomannan (LAM), as a diagnostic
pathogen biomarker has been widely demonstrated and one point-of-care (POC) LAM assay (Alere Determine™
TB LAM) is currently on the market. Alere’s technology incorporates LAM detection in a urine-based lateral flow
assay (LFA) and while easy to use, its poor diagnostic sensitivity limits its utility to patients with extremely high
LAM concentrations (e.g., patients with advanced HIV disease and CD4 counts <100). This limitation is
particularly problematic in children, given their higher incidence of paucibacillary TB (when LAM concentration
is likely even lower).
In this study we will bridge the gap between the unmet need for TB diagnostics in children and the use of LAM
as a promising solution by applying an emerging technology, termed “FLOW”, to enhance the sensitivity of the
LAM LFA. While the Alere LFA measures LAM from only a few droplets of urine, FLOW concentrates LAM from
several mL of urine into ~100 µL, which is then assayed by the LFA. Importantly, FLOW concentration is
completely passive, requiring little or no additional steps beyond LFA-based analysis, thus making it a simple
and user friendly “front end” for LFAs, especially within low resource settings where TB is most prominent. As
proof of principle, in a small, adult only, first-in-human (FIH) study performed in South Africa (funded by the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation, see letter of support), running FLOW-concentrated urine on Alere and (our newly
developed) Salus LFAs resulted in doubling of clinical sensitivity.
In this FastTrack SBIR proposal we will optimize and adapt FLOW for the diagnosis of TB in pediatric patients
by: In Aim 1, optimizing the FLOW technology to maximize analytical sensitivity among children with TB; In Aim
2, assessing clinical sensitivity in a small, pediatric only, pilot study performed at our partner clinical research
site in South Africa; In Aim 3, implementing necessary changes and/or improvements as needed and develop
an improved collection-to-answer workflow for our device, including furthering the development the Salus LFA.
Additionally, we propose to develop a “wearable” adaptor, geared toward the very young (e.g. ages 0-4) and
very sick, that will plug into our FLOW workflow and allow for efficient sample collection and assessment of
patient TB status; and in Aim 4 employing our FLOW TB assay back to South Africa for a properly powered
study, the results of which will provide a foundation for our route to commercialization (Aim 5). Importantly, we
have already identified partners (Abbott Laboratories, Intuitive Biosciences, see letters of support) to complete
the commercialization process if the data from the proposed work is promising."
10744797,"Project Summary
T cell exhaustion is a dysfunctional T cell state after chronic antigen exposure, and this exhausted T cells
(TEX) are often developed in chronic infection or tumor microenvironment. One of the key features of TEX is
increased expression of inhibitory molecules such as Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and
Programmed Death 1 (PD-1). These molecules work as immune checkpoints to suppress T cell function in
order to prevent pathological damage from T cell hyper-activation. However, in the tumor microenvironment,
these molecules limit the cytotoxic effect of T cells to kill tumor. Blocking these immune checkpoints has
been shown to achieve significant clinical benefits in multiple cancer types. Despite of these successes, the
majority of the patients do not achieve long-term tumor remission. Thus, it is crucial to study the underlying
molecular mechanism of T cell exhaustion development, and seek for potential combination strategies with
immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to enhance and sustain T cell response in clinic.
During my doctoral research, I focus on investigating the transcriptional mechanisms of T cell exhaustion
development, and how transcription factors control T cell reinvigoration after PD-1 blockade. In Specific Aim
1.1, I focused on the transcriptional mechanisms of effector T cell loss and TEX progenitor establishment
during chronic antigen exposure. Using single cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-Seq), we found two distinct
transcriptional networks in the chronic effector T cells and the TEX progenitors, and we systematically
described the molecular mechanism of TEX development. In Specific Aim 1.2, I focus on establishing a T cell
based in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screening system (RetroCRISPR) to functionally study transcriptional
mechanisms during T cell reinvigoration by PD-1 blockade. These studies will not only discover novel
mechanisms of T cell exhaustion, but also provide high dimensional profiling or high throughput screening
systems for the field to study T cell response. In Specific Aim 2, I plan to extend my RetroCRISPR system
into dissecting the complexity of tumor microenvironment, and I will search for potential combination
strategies with ICB to enhance T cell response. The overall goal for my current projects and future plans is
to discover cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms affecting T cell response, and design optimal immune
therapeutic strategies for long-term tumor remission."
10830244,"Project Summary
The vast majority of our understanding regarding the function of classical developmental
signaling pathways comes from studies outside the nervous system. We are interested
in the overarching question of how evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways are
customized for signaling at synapses. There are significant unanswered questions
regarding how these pathways interface with synaptic activity as well as how they signal
in the dense microenvironment of the synaptic cleft. Our identification of Crimpy and
α2δ-3 as two novel components of a synaptic Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)
signaling pathway provides key insights into both questions, positioning us to explore
innovative hypotheses directed at understanding how growth factors organize
synapses. Our published studies indicate that autocrine BMP signaling assembles
multiple principal features of the presynaptic compartment. Here, we build on novel
findings relating to the regulation and function of this pathway. We provide evidence that
autocrine BMP signaling maintains trans-synaptic adhesion and alignment of the pre-
and postsynaptic compartments. Shedding light on these phenotypes, we identified the
ECM protein SPARC as a putative BMP downstream effector. Lastly, we present novel
preliminary data that the ability of this pathway to nucleate new presynaptic active
zones is impeded by a transmembrane protein in the LRIG family."
10832036,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects approximately 100,000 people in the U.S. but 300,000 babies are born with
SCD every year globally. Currently few pharmaceutical options are available as a therapy, and life expectancy
is still low for these individuals. Consequences of accelerated arterial damage include a 221-fold increased risk
of strokes in children and then increased risk of hemorrhagic strokes during the third decade of life. Elastic lamina
fragmentation were hallmarks identified in autopsy specimens of children with SCD, but underlying mechanisms
are unclear and therefore cannot be prevented. Cysteine cathepsins are powerful proteases implicated in elastin
and collagen degradation in cardiovascular disease (i.e. atherosclerosis). It was recently published by the PIs
that cathepsins are similarly active in a transgenic sickle cell mouse model, and inhibition of JNK signaling
blocked this as well as pathological arterial remodeling and biomechanical consequences. The long term goal
is to identify novel therapeutic targets to inhibit proteolytic activity and cellular mechanisms that cause
accelerated elastin and collagen degradation and pathological biomechanics in arteries of children and adults
with SCD, and determine accumulated damage as they age. The objective is to investigate cathepsin-mediated
arteriopathy and pathological biomechanical changes in large arteries due to SCD causing irreparable damage,
and if curative bone marrow therapies prevent further arterial remodeling. Based on preliminary data and
published studies, the central hypothesis is that cathepsin-mediated elastinolytic and collagenolytic activity in
large arteries is JNK-dependent and downstream of the chronic inflammation (TNFα and monocytosis) caused
by sickle cell disease. This hypothesis will be tested according to the following aims: Aim 1. To determine roles
of cathepsin K in elastic lamina and collagen degradation by SCD as mice age and accumulate damage to
arteries using a new mouse model that was generated by the investigators that is transgenic for sickle cell
disease but null for cathepsin K. Aim 2. To improve JNK inhibition strategies that downregulate cathepsin
expression and protect arterial integrity. Aim 3. To determine efficacy of curative BMT in preventing further
arterial damage, and the need for further pharmaceutical interventions. This work is significant because its
success will identify mechanisms to preserve integrity of arteries that undergo progressive damage over a
lifetime with SCD even after curative bone marrow transplants. Innovative aspects include: 1) Studying arterial
remodeling complications of SCD as opposed to the deoxygenated post-capillary venules and microcirculation
that has dominated the field; 2) decomposing collagen degradation from elastin fragmentation and impact on
arterial mechanics in SCD; and 3) identifying critical ages by which maintenance of vascular integrity may offer
improved chance of preventing future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications, impacting quality and
duration of life of those living with the genetic disorder sickle cell disease."
10832039,"An overarching goal of our research is to understand how the base excision repair (BER) pathway maintains
genomic integrity and mediates epigenetic regulation, and how deficiencies in BER impact human health. A
major focus is to discover how DNA glycosylases, which initiate BER, find and excise damaged or modified
forms of 5-methylcytosine (mC). The most abundant modified DNA base in nature, mC is critical for epigenetic
regulation in plants and animals and for restriction modification in archaea and bacteria. However, cytosine
methylation also poses a danger because mC deaminates to T, generating G/T mispairs and C to T mutations
that threaten genomic and epigenetic integrity and causes human diseases including cancer. Countering this
threat are three different types of glycosylases that excise T from G/T mispairs; TDG and MBD4 in mammals
and MIG in archaea and bacteria. While most glycosylases excise bases that are foreign to DNA (e.g., uracil)
these enzymes face the daunting task of removing thymine bases arising by mC deamination but not those in
the vast background of A:T pairs or in polymerase-generated G/T mispairs. Because glycosylase action on
undamaged DNA is mutagenic, the specificity of these G/T glycosylases is critical, yet it is poorly defined. The
current paradigm holds that specificity involves recognition of the mismatched guanine. We will rigorously test
this model and investigate other potential specificity factors, to define the mechanism of G/T glycosylase
specificity. Our studies will reveal features of TDG and MBD4 that may account for inefficient repair of mC
deamination, a potential cause of point mutations implicated in cancer and genetic disease. BER also functions
in epigenetic regulation by serving to “erase” mC through active DNA demethylation. An established pathway
in vertebrates involves oxidation of mC by a TET enzyme to give three oxy-mC products (hmC, fC, caC),
excision of fC or caC by TDG, and subsequent BER to yield unmodified C. Our studies will address major gaps
in the understanding of this essential pathway, by defining how TDG recognizes and removes fC and caC and
how it is recruited to sites of DNA demethylation. We are also interested in how post-translational modifications
regulate BER, and our current focus is on determining how TDG is regulated by SUMO modification. TDG is
sumoylated at a single site, and it has a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) that binds SUMO domains, including an
intramolecular SUMO. While TDG is considered a model for understanding how sumoylation can regulate
enzyme activity, many fundamental questions remain. Our studies will reveal how sumoylation alters TDG
activity and how the SIM mediates these effects. We will also define mechanisms of SUMO conjugation and
deconjugation and learn how the SIM modulates these processes. An in vitro conjugation-deconjugation
system will be used to test the paradigm that sumoylation of TDG is required to regulate its product release
and ensure faithful completion of TDG-initiated BER. Results of these studies will inform how BER deficiencies

10819569,"Summary: Experimental Integration, Design and Analysis Core
The Experimental Integration, Design, and Analysis (EIDA) Core is an essential component of the program
project that is uniquely designed to implement novel cellular, molecular and informatic strategies, and to
synergize collaboration and integration of Program investigation to drive scientific discoveries. The Program is
thematically centered on novel mechanisms of epigenetic regulation that are relevant to breast cancer. The EIDA
Core is designed to capture the momentum of the Program, as well as to provide cohesive experimental and
analytical design that will ensure rigor and reproducibility. The EIDA Core will centralize experimental design,
bioinformatics support for data sharing and integration, and biostatistical analyses for patient-based, cell- and
organoid-derived findings. The Core will ensure that every project is using standardized reagents, protocols and
bioinformatics methods, such that data comparisons among projects can be made. Each project uses cutting-
edge omics-based approaches; the application of these technologies necessitates significant expertise and
implementation of best practices for scientific rigor and transparency, which will be provided by the EIDA Core.
Support by the Core is essential for discoveries that will be generated by each of the projects.
The goal of the EIDA core is to maximize integration of experimental effort and output. This innovative multi-
dimensional core will accelerate research progress of the Program. The Aims of the EIDA Core are to provide:
1) Generation and authentication of biological models and reagents. Stringent quality control of reagents and
uniform experimental protocols are essential for data comparison across all projects. 2) Analyses and integration
of next generation sequencing data will assure that multiple types of genomic data can be compared for
biologically relevant interpretation. Centralization of bioinformatics analysis in the Core positions the Program
bioinformatician to perform analyses with the overall Program strategy and goals in mind, so that data generated
by each Project can be used to inform and integrate results with the other projects. 3) Rigor and reproducibility
of experimental strategies through statistical validation of the findings will enhance and strengthen discoveries
that can be translated to clinical care in future studies.
Impact: The EIDA core will enable integration of datasets by connecting the shared and distinct properties of
epigenetic control and genome organization with breast cancer onset, progression and treatment response."

This clinical trial will uncover new mechanisms of inter-individual responses to endogenous and exogenous
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in Hispanics/Latinos (H/Ls) with prediabetes. The results move the
management of prediabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and relevant metabolic diseases to a more
individualized approach in an understudied and at-risk population. Few options exist for prediabetes treatment,
and the current pharmaceutical management of T2DM does not predict drug treatment failures, nor differences
in individual treatment responses and adverse effects. A precise, genetics-based approach will provide superior
therapeutic management for patients. GLP-1-based therapies reduce blood glucose, promote weight loss,
decrease cardiovascular events, and improve renal function. Prior genetic studies, most done in Caucasians,
identified associations between genetic variants and decreased GLP-1-induced insulin secretion, in an effort to
guide individualized treatment. However, these associations do not provide a clear mechanistic relationship
between genotype and phenotype. Transcriptomic analyses will uncover many of these mechanisms. Here, we
propose to 1) test the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that regulate expression (eQTLs)
of 11 candidate genes in a range of relevant metabolic tissues with differential GLP-1 response, 2) perform RNA
sequencing before and after treatment to identify eQTLs in blood that predict response to GLP-1 therapy and
develop risk-based prediction models in H/Ls, and 3) determine the effects of genetic regulation of candidate
genes and newly discovered eQTLs phenome-wide in a large existing biobank, BioVU. For aims 1 and 2,
responses will be measured in 300 study subjects with prediabetes recruited from an established Mexican-
American cohort via the oral minimal model method, before and after GLP-1 therapy, quantifying GLP-1
hormone efficacy and GLP-1-induced pancreatic beta cell insulin release and peripheral insulin sensitivity.
Procedures include serial measurements of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and GLP-1, and peripheral blood
collection for RNA sequencing. Our central hypotheses are: (1) metabolic tissue-based eQTLs of GLP-1-
associated genes will be associated with physiological response to endogenous and exogenous GLP-1,
(2) identification of eQTLs associated with GLP-1 treatment-induced changes in whole blood will identify new
gene targets, and (3) this data will lead to the creation of eQTL-based prediction models for related diseases.
The study is innovative because it uses a novel combination of eQTL analysis and oral minimal model to assess
GLP-1 response, examines a population highly underrepresented in pharmacogenomic studies, and utilizes
novel statistical methods and applications to study gene expression. The significance of this newly acquired
mechanistic information will ultimately guide precision therapeutic regimens for diabetes prevention and
treatment, weight loss, cardiovascular risk reduction, and related metabolic complications in an understudied
population."

This MIRA/R35 application was conceived to replace R01 grants GM126033 and GM124434. These projects
address the regulation of cell growth and proliferation, a central topic in cell and developmental biology that is
relevant to the many human disorders in which cell growth is dysregulated (e.g. degenerative diseases,
inflammatory conditions, cancers). Our NIGMS-supported research reaches back to 1994, with the singular
objective to understand how cell proliferation is regulated in vivo, in the complex context of the animal body. Our
research addresses fundamental issues: how growth signaling drives cell growth, how cell growth-associated
metabolism regulates cell cycle progression, and how environmental, cellular and molecular interactions regulate
growth signaling activities in vivo. We primarily utilize genetic approaches in Drosophila, with a current focus on
intestinal epithelial renewal, but we also seize opportunities to translate our findings using human cells and
organoids. Two of our projects are testing the unorthodox hypothesis that growth-dependent translation of
mRNAs encoding limiting cell cycle regulators determines whether, and how fast, cells proliferate. We have
validated this mechanism in Drosophila and human cells, and are currently investigating how upstream
EGFR/RAS/ERK and Insulin/PI3K/mTOR signaling interface with the growth-dependent translation of factors
that promote DNA replication (e.g. E2F1, CCNE2, CDC45). A third, related project will extend our discovery that
EGFR/ERK signaling promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and a metabolic shift that activates cell growth and
proliferation, in both Drosophila and human cells. New paradigms explaining how growth is coupled to cell
division can present novel strategies and gene targets for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of common
diseases involving dysregulated cell proliferation. Two final projects focus on how the Drosophila intestine
senses and responds to damage. This is relevant to proliferative control because, for most epithelia, damage
initiates a regenerative response that comprises growth signaling, stem cell activation, and regulated cell
division. Epithelial damage responses also stimulate inflammation, giving further clinical relevance. To
understand this regenerative response, genomics approaches (ATAC-seq, Cut&Tag, RNA-seq) will be used to
identify the target genes of damage-dependent Cytokine/Jak/Stat signaling. In addition, we are conducting a
unique, high-throughput functional screen using enterocyte-targeted RNAi’s to identify all of the Drosophila
genes required to sense gut epithelial damage and initiate regeneration. A comprehensive catalog of the genes
used in tissue damage responses will be a foundational resource for extending our understanding of stress-
activated-, inflammatory-, and regenerative signaling. This will in turn present new approaches for: 1) controlling
inflammation during infections and in auto-immune diseases, and: 2) stimulating regeneration to combat
degenerative disease, and to aid tissue engineering."
10839372,"Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that are capable of killing malignant cells without antigen-specific
receptor recognition. Due to this property, NK cells have been utilized for adoptive immune cell therapy for a
variety of malignancies. Despite limited success for hematologic malignancies, the therapeutic potential of NK
cell therapy for cancer has been limited by the insufficient cytotoxic activity of NK cells particularly for solid
tumors. Due to the ability of NK cells to specifically target cancer cells and avoid killing of normal cells, we
hypothesize that enhancing the cytotoxic activity of NK cells can lead to enhanced efficacy of NK cell therapies
for cancer. As the molecular mediators regulating NK cell cytotoxic activity are still not fully characterized, we
will conduct a small molecule high throughput compound library screen to identify novel mediators of NK cell
cytotoxic activity. The purpose of this work is to identify small molecules that can be further developed for
therapeutic purposes as well as to reveal important probes to elucidate mechanistic insights into NK cell
activity that may enable future targeted approaches. In the first aim, we will identify compounds that
enhance NK cell killing of ovarian cancer cells through a HTS of a diverse 300k small molecule collection.
In the second aim, the primary hits will be tested in a series of secondary assays to identify the most
promising hits. The most promising hits will then undergo biological characterization in vitro and in vivo. It
is hoped that this work will lead to the identification of promising approaches to improve NK cell therapy
for cancer patients."

COVID-19 vaccination is safe, immunogenic, and durable in individuals with treated and virally suppressed HIV
infection but is less immunogenic in immunosuppressed individuals and those with unsuppressed HIV infection.
The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is still limited in countries with high HIV prevalence and low access to
antiretroviral therapy (ART), necessary to suppress HIV viral replication and reduce HIV-associated
comorbidities. Thus, studying COVID-19 vaccination in immunosuppressed and untreated HIV populations is
needed. We generated an Alphavirus-derived replicon RNA (repRNA) SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate, repRNA-
CoV2S, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and delivered by a novel Lipid InOrganic Nanoparticle (LION),
a cationic nanoemulsion (CNE). This vaccine platform generates robust and durable protective immunity against
SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice and nonhuman primates. Preliminary studies indicate this vaccine is immunogenic
in non-human primates with HIV-induced immunosuppression and those with B-cell deficiencies, demonstrating
that a repRNA-CoV2S vaccine could be employed to induce strong immunity against COVID-19 in
immunosuppressed individuals living with HIV. Here, in a highly relevant pre-clinical SIV macaque model for HIV
infection, we will test a 2nd generation COVID-19 vaccine, repRNA- Omicron, that 1) encodes the SARS-CoV-2
Omicron S protein and 2) is comprised of a novel chimeric immunogen (SHARP) which focuses immune
responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and promotes neutralizing antibodies. We will evaluate the
immunogenicity and durability of repRNA-Omicron during untreated SIV-associated immunosuppression and
examine the role of SIV-induced immune activation and exhaustion on vaccine immune memory. Furthermore,
our studies will aim to understand the mechanisms driving humoral memory by the novel repRNA/LION vaccine
platform. If successful, this work will further contribute to understanding the mechanisms driving SARS-CoV-2
vaccine breakthrough infections and reinfections in people living with HIV and will inform improved treatment
and vaccine strategies for people living with HIV and other immunocompromised individuals."

NOS1 signalosome. This pathway is necessary for regulation of cardiac contractile function. We
also hypothesize that G-protein kinase 5 (GRK5) promotes phosphorylation of cardiac β1AR

signaling in heart. Aim 2. SAP97 maintains the integrity of β1AR-SAP97-NOS1 signalosome to

10781971,"The Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders supports a full day of
presentations by leading scientists in areas that are having transformational effects in the
communication sciences and disorders (CSD) discipline. The Research Symposium is held at the
annual Convention of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and is open
to all of the approximately 15,000 Convention attendees, which includes students, practitioners,
and researchers. Following Convention, the Symposium content is widely disseminated through
audio recordings of the presentations, which are synced with the slides and transcribed, and by
making them freely accessible on the ASHA website. Additionally, each presenter submits an
article based on their presentation to the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research
to be published in the annual Research Symposium Forum. An innovation that will be
implemented in this current funding cycle is that ASHA will make these articles freely accessible
upon publication on the ASHA Journals website and will deposit them in PubMed Central
without embargo. The first aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance scientific
discourse and dissemination of scientific discovery and innovation on five topics that are having
transformational effects across several subareas in CSD. This will be accomplished, in part, by
making the Research Symposium Forum open access and by widely promoting both the
recorded and the written content across ASHA’s many communication channels. Over the next
5-year funding cycle, the Symposium will address five topics that cut across the areas of hearing,
speech, language, and other aspects of cognition, including (1) Health and Healthcare Equity of
People With Communication Disabilities, (2) Bilingualism, (3) Artificial Intelligence in CSD, (4)
Genetics in CSD, and (5) Intervention and Implementation Clinical Trials in CSD. The second
aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance the research career development of early-
career scientists focused on research in CSD. Between 2021 and 2025, the Research Mentoring-
Pair Travel Award and ASHA’s in-kind contribution will provide funding to attend the
Symposium and mentoring support to 130 early-career scientists in CSD. The Travel Award
recipients will attend the Symposium along with a mentor and engage in mentored research
activities before, during, and after each Symposium. These activities are designed to help
integrate the protégés into their scientific community and encourage them to pursue a research
career and become productive scholars. The scientific base of the CSD discipline will be
strengthened by these scientific dissemination, research education, and mentoring activities."
10831488,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human genome is constantly attacked from sources that include environmental pollutants, other
exogenous origins that include drug treatment, endogenous reactive oxygen species, and UV light. Among the
lesions/adducts are ones derived from polycyclic aromatic compounds, widespread byproducts of fossil fuel
combustion found at toxic waste dumps, superfund sites, in our air, food and water. The resulting DNA lesions
cause mutations that lead to cancer. However, not all DNA lesions are equally carcinogenic, as their mutagenic
propensities vary: a cascade of processes determines whether they are repaired, or survive for mutagenic or
error-free bypass by DNA polymerases. Human nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a key mechanism for
removal of many such DNA lesions. The vital importance of NER is demonstrated in the devastating human
disorder xeroderma pigmentosum, caused by mutations in NER genes. Notably, some lesions are rapidly
repaired, some slowly, and some are resistant and thus particularly genotoxic, a phenomenon that is poorly
understood. Likewise, there is a gap in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying DNA lesion bypass by
polymerases that can lead to a mutagenic or error-free outcome. The objective of this project is to provide
mechanistic insights into the puzzling variability of DNA lesion mutagenicity, focusing on the key steps of lesion
recognition for repair and mutagenic bypass, to yield integrated new molecular and dynamic understanding of
lesion mutagenic proclivity in unprecedented atomistic detail, using molecular dynamics simulations.
 Our overall hypothesis is that the structure of the lesion and its base sequence context determine its
overall mutagenic propensity. In Aim 1, we will utilize a selected set of DNA lesions/adducts whose structures
differ greatly in size and shape, placed in differing sequence contexts, to determine structural, energetic and
dynamic characteristics of the lesion-containing DNAs as they bind to Rad4/XPC, the yeast homolog of the
human XPC lesion recognition protein. We will reveal how those that bind for productive recognition leading to
excision differ from those that fail to do so. In Aim 2 we will determine how the human XPD helicase in TFIIH,
that verifies the presence of lesions for NER by stalling, processes lesions of different sizes and shapes, and
how XPD mutations that cause human disease inhibit XPD’s function. In Aim 3 we will determine how differing
lesion structures in varying nucleosomal positions impose different distortions on the nucleosome and how
selected histone acetylations modulate these distortions, to promote or inhibit access for repair. In Aim 4 we
investigate endogenous and exogenous DNA peptide crosslink lesions, to determine how selected DNA
bypass polymerases process them error-free or mutagenically, in differing DNA sequence contexts.
 Focusing on the most mutagenic lesions, our work will facilitate identification of appropriate biomarkers
for determining risk of developing cancer, advance design of chemotherapy drugs that are less repaired, and
yield a predictive tool to identify mutational hotspot sequences induced by different lesions in human tumors."
10843739,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While an infectious etiology has been proposed to be involved in the initiation and progression of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), more evidence is needed to support the roles of specific infectious agents and to identify
mechanisms by which they act. Given the chronic nature of AD and based on our discoveries in animal models
of AD, we hypothesize that a chronic and sub-acute infection with specific Bacteroides strains contributes to AD
by affecting Ab and tau phosphorylation, aggregation, and clearance, and contributing to neuronal toxicity. In
support of our hypothesis, we were the first group to demonstrate that Bacteroides not only correlated with Ab
levels in the brain, but actually increased amyloid plaques when administered to animal models of AD. Strikingly,
Bacteroides is elevated in AD, correlates with CSF levels of Ab42 and phospho-tau, and is associated with
markers of gut inflammation in AD patients, suggesting a direct relevance to human disease. In our preliminary
data, we found that B. fragilis affected cortical expression of genes involved in APP and tau phosphorylation that
promote their aggregation, as well as genes related to memory and neuronal death. We also found that
Bacteroides downregulated microglial genes important for the clearance of Ab. Depletion of Bacteroides with
metronidazole decreased amyloid plaques, increased cortical expression of insulin degrading enzyme, which
can degrade Ab, and affected genes involved in multiple protein degradation pathways. We found that
Bacteroides could impair macrophage Ab phagocytosis in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we found that transfer
of human gut microbiota from AD patients into mice affected similar microglia genes involved in protein
degradation and clearance, as well as pathways related to neuronal cell death, suggesting that the AD gut
microbiota may harbor infectious agents that contribute to the disease process. Because Bacteroides species
are highly prevalent in humans and exhibit a high degree of functional variation among strains, it is not likely that
all Bacteroides contribute to AD. In this proposal, we will modify Koch’s postulates to detect Bacteroides strains
associated with AD vs. healthy controls and non-AD dementia controls, isolate these strains in pure culture, and
use in vitro assays to optimize strain selection for in vivo studies. We will then transfer AD-derived strains to WT
mice and animal models of AD, measure AD pathology, and re-isolate our AD-derived strains to determine
whether they play a causal role. To investigate potential mechanisms, we will also investigate whether AD strains
can affect APP and tau aggregation and clearance, neuronal toxicity, or disrupt transcriptional networks in
microglia and neurons. By investigating the molecular and functional diversity in Bacteroides in AD, our studies
have the potential to identify novel pathogenicity factors in Bacteroides that could be used both for the diagnosis
and treatment of AD."

ABSTRACT
Membrane Protein Folding and Assembly
 Many human diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, result from misfolding of membrane proteins
(MPs) during their synthesis and targeting. It is therefore important to understand the principles
and mechanism of MP folding and assembly. A largely unexplored part of the problem is to
understand folding in the context of the cellular milieu. Toward that goal, we are studying the
targeting, secretion, and insertion of membrane proteins along the so-called SecA post-
translational pathway of living Escherichia coli. We have shown that the SecA motor ATPase,
a significant drug target, can insert single-span membrane proteins (S-SMPs) across the E. coli
inner membrane. This simplified in vivo model system eliminates the many unanswered
questions about the folding of multi-span MPs along the signal recognition particle (SRP)
pathway, because we gain direct access to the translocon-bilayer partitioning process.
 We have engineered two different chimeric protein families for probing systematically S-
SMP stability using TM segments of the form GGPG-H-GPGG (used in an earlier study to
determine a biological hydrophobicity scale using a cell-free eukaryotic system). To determine
stabilities, we have developed methods for cleaving TM segments in vivo via native
intramembrane proteases. We have discovered that many S-SMPs are stable across the
membrane only because their periplasmic & cytoplasmic domains cannot cross the membrane.
We have also discovered that translocon-to-membrane transfer energetics are not equal to
membrane-to-cytoplasm transfer energetics and that stability depends upon growth
temperature. An important aspect of our work is the use of Molecular Dynamics simulations in
concert with experiments to understand the dynamics of the SecYEG translocon. Little is known
about SecA function at the atomic level despite hundreds of papers on the subject. Calling
upon our lab’s expertise in lipid-protein interactions, we have laid the foundation for electron
cryomicroscopic (cryo-EM) studies of the structure of SecA bound to lipid nanodiscs. Our
ambition is to obtain a complete structural view of the SecA-guided secretion process.

Large-scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of genetic variants
associated with complex diseases. The aggregation of all the variants that are known to contribute to the disease
in the form of polygenic risk scores (PRS) improves the prediction of a range of complex diseases. Most PRS
have been developed within European ancestry study samples and have shown to perform poorly in other
race/ethnic groups, further exaggerating health disparities across ancestries. As genetic approaches for
precision medicine become more popular, there is a critical need to responsively and pro-actively expand access
to accurate PRS. Specifically, diabetes, and its associated complications are one of the biggest global health
problems of the 21st century. In fact, type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), gestational diabetes (GDM) and
related complications are excellent disease models to study the utility of PRS for predicting heterogenous and
complex health outcomes in a setting where dramatic racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities exist. Not only
are PRS useful to predict T1D and T2D, but they can distinguish between T1D and T2D, and between T2D
subtypes. The wealth of existing trans-ancestry GWAS data from diabetes subtypes, complications, and
quantitative traits recently generated provides a unique opportunity for constructing highly transferable PRS
across populations. To address the disparities in PRS across ancestries, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary
team to aggregate and analyze the largest existing genetic data from more than 1.8 M individuals (35% non-
European) with T1D, T2D, GDM and glycemia-related complications and quantitative traits to improve the PRS
prediction of diabetes and progression across lifespan in diverse ancestries with these Aims: (1) Collection,
harmonization and integration of large-scale, multi-ancestry cohorts with diabetes traits across the life-span and
genomics for development, training and testing PRS for diverse ancestries; (2) Development of methods to
improve PRS prediction in non-European populations by using Bayesian approaches that allow integration of
linkage disequilibrium and summary statistics from several ancestries. (3) Development, testing, and comparing
performance of PRS for each trait, development of risk prediction tools that integrate clinical and genetic risk
factors, and assessment of scenarios where PRS improve the prediction. Accomplishing the aims of this proposal
will demonstrate how genomic data can inform more efficient and targeted preventive strategies within healthcare
systems and across ethnically diverse populations. Findings are expected to advance precision care of patients
with diabetes and related conditions in people of diverse ancestral background and serve as a paradigm for
many other complex diseases."
10815723,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The bestrophin proteins are a family of Ca2+-activated anion channels widely distributed from bacteria to
mammals, with representatives in most metazoans including four in humans (Best1-4). They open in response
to increases of intracellular Ca2+ to mediate the passive flow of Cl− and other anions. Best1 and Best2 both have
critical roles in the eye. Best1 is predominantly expressed in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the retina playing
an essential role in generating a vision-related electrical signal named “light peak”, while mutations in the human
BEST1 gene have been genetically linked to at least five retinal degenerative disorders collectively known as
bestrophinopathies. Best2 is highly expressed in non-pigmented epithelium (NPE) of the ciliary body, and is
involved in aqueous humor formation and drainage, which ultimately determine intra-ocular pressure (IOP).
Knockout of Best2 in mice leads to a reduction of IOP, suggesting the pharmaceutical potential of targeting Best2
and its regulators for relieving ocular hypertension, which is a common risk factor for numerous eye diseases
including open-angle glaucoma. However, despite bestrophins’ biological and pharmaceutical significance, little
is known about their cellular regulation in a physiological context. More specifically, in a given cell/tissue, how is
the bestrophin channel modulated to conduct which anion(s) for what downstream purpose(s)? The answer to
this question lies within the protein network that interacts with bestrophins in different tissues/cells. Although
ample evidence suggest the existence of tissue-specific interacting regulators of bestrophins, no protein is known
to interact with Best2, while only a few have been reported to interact with Best1. Our lab studies the biophysics
and regulation of bestrophin channels using a multidisciplinary platform consisting of cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryo-EM), mass spectrometry, electrophysiological recording, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome
editing, and stem cell reprogramming/differentiation. The goal of the next five years is to identify Best1 and Best2
interacting protein complexes in RPE and NPE, respectively, and to understand the functional consequences of
these interactions. Overall, the proposed work will make contributions to multiple fields of research including
calcium signaling, ion transport, membrane protein structure and ocular physiology, and the pipelines established
in this work can be generally applied to study different ion channels and other membrane proteins of interest."
10896917,"Developmental biology is now both a molecular and systems-level science. Forward- and reverse-genetic
technologies have identified individual genes that regulate tissue formation and contribute to their oncogenic
transformation later in life. High-throughput sequencing has revealed the “omic” features that differentiate cellular
states. Translating this knowledge into mechanistic understanding will require new scientific approaches, and
chemistry can help bridge this gap. Chemical synthesis and protein engineering can empower us to interrogate
tissue biology in new ways, and the resulting technologies and insights can lead to innovative treatments for
human disease. With these goals in mind, our research group has explored the interface of chemistry and
developmental biology. Over the past four years, we have developed an optogenetic system for targeted cell
ablation, identified novel small-molecule inhibitors of Gli transcription factor function, and discovered the first
specific inhibitors of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1 (ALDH1B1), a mitochondrial enzyme that is expressed in
multipotent cells of the adult intestine and pancreas and promotes colorectal and pancreatic cancer. We have
also used high-throughput and systems-level approaches to establish a regulatory model for ARHGAP36, a non-
canonical Gli activator that controls motor neuron specification and can induce medulloblastoma.
 We now seek to build upon these accomplishments and explore new scientific directions. One focus of our
research program will be the creation of new optogenetic tools that act through inducible allostery rather than
proximity. To facilitate the discovery of such constructs, we have established a transposon-based platform that
recapitulates the evolution of natural photoreceptors. Using this approach, we will develop optogenetic regulators
of the Hedgehog pathway, focusing on light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain-functionalized forms of Smoothened
and GLI1. We will elucidate the mechanistic basis of their light-dependent activities, optimize their functionality,
and apply these reagents to study Hedgehog pathway-dependent patterning in zebrafish models. We will also
extend this platform to other developmental pathways such as bone morphogenetic protein signaling. Our
second research focus will be ALDH1 isoforms that are highly expressed in normal stem cells and integral to
tumor initiation and progression. We will investigate the roles of ALDH1B1 in pancreatic cancer and develop
specific inhibitors of ALDH1A3, a cytoplasmic enzyme that promotes breast cancer, melanoma, and
glioblastoma, and other malignancies. In addition, we will pursue small molecules that target ALDH1A1 and/or
ALDH1A2, motivated by the roles of these enzymes in spermatogenesis and their potential as non-hormonal
male contraceptive targets. Collectively, our studies will open new windows into developmental biology and new
doors to clinical therapies."

In this application for a K23 Mentored Patient Oriented Research Career Development Award, Dr. Jonathan
Wai proposes a comprehensive clinical study and training plan for development of an independent researcher
with expertise in device-based treatments and neuroimaging for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal
seeks to study the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on alcohol self-administration
and in vivo brain GABA levels in non-treatment seeking human participants with AUD. Previous studies have
shown that AUD is associated with broad dysfunction in the prefrontal cortices, as well as decreased
prefrontal GABA concentrations. Additionally, rTMS has been shown to increase prefrontal GABA in treatment
studies with depressed patients, with the increase in GABA associated with clinical improvement. Early work
using rTMS for AUD has shown that rTMS can decrease craving and reported alcohol use. Thus, rTMS to the
prefrontal cortex may serve as a potential treatment for AUD, either alone or as an adjunct to existing
treatments.
We plan to conduct two sham-controlled, double-blinded, randomized human laboratory alcohol self-
administration studies during the award period. For Study 1, AUD participants will be admitted to a research
unit and randomized to receive active (n=22) or sham (n=22) rTMS. Participants will have an alcohol self-
administration session and neuroimaging with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) before and after three
weeks of rTMS. We will compare the number of choices for alcohol and brain GABA levels in AUD participants
receiving active vs. sham rTMS. Study 2 (n=20) will be a pilot study using the same procedures, with the
addition of naltrexone in both active and sham rTMS groups. In conducting this study and pursuing
coursework and supervision from his mentors (Drs. Diana Martinez, Suzette Evans, and Christoph Juchem) and
collaborators (Drs. Markus Heilig, Abraham Zangen, and Hanga Galfalvy), Dr. Wai will engage in an
individualized training program to develop expertise in 1) Research with clinical rTMS, 2) Clinical research
methods, 3) MRS acquisition and analysis methods, 4) Advanced biostatistics, and 5) Grant writing and
management."
10853133,"Title: Cadmium-potentiated metabolic reprogramming in pathogenesis of lung fibrosis
Project Summary
Cd is a toxic environmental metal contaminant, number 7 on Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry (ATSDR) Substance Priority List. Lung diseases are extremely common. Our previous study shows
that lung Cd burden found in non-smoker's lung caused changes in the mouse lung metabolome,
transcriptome and redox proteome with effects on airway reactivity, glycolysis and lipid metabolism,
inflammation and fibrotic signaling. This has considerable implications for risk of pulmonary fibrosis and other
interstitial lung diseases. Humans do not have an efficient mechanism for Cd removal; thus, Cd burden in
humans increases with age. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of bronchiolitis in infants and
causes considerable morbidity due to subsequent development of asthma in elderly. Our previous integrated
omics analyses of low-dose Cd toxicity in lung showed association with zinc finger DHHC domain-containing
palmitoyltransferase zDHHC11 and Cd-dependent response with activation of mTORC1 signaling, linked to
lung fibrosis. Integrated network responses of metabolome to low dose Cd exposure with RSV infection
showed mitochondrial dysfunction with disrupted energy metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis as critical
intermediate responses in Cd-dependent lung injury. Based on our findings and available data, we hypothesize
that 1) infant RSV infection reprograms protein S-palmitoylation as an activator of mTORC1; 2) Cd reprograms
mitochondrial metabolism and redox signaling to create a sustained driver of mTORC1 activity; 3) the
combination of mTORC1 activators creates a vicious cycle because mTORC1 activates S-palmitoylation; 4)
sustained mTORC1 activity causes lung fibrosis. We propose three Aims to test these mechanisms using
molecular, cell biology, pathology and omics methods in mice and cultured lung cells with controlled Cd dosing.
Aim 1 will determine whether Cd potentiates RSV-induced protein S-palmitoylation via regulating the activity of
key proteins, zDHHC11, acyl protein thioesterase. Aim 2 is to examine the role of mTORC1 in Cd-potentiated
fibrosis pathways using mouse and cell models. Aim 3 will test whether lung Cd burden serves as a driver for
fibrosis following RSV infection by effects on mitochondria and activation of mTORC1 signaling. Targeted
analyses will provide direct tests of the proposed mechanisms for low-dose Cd and RSV infection in lung
fibrosis. The integrated omics approaches will additionally provide the first detailed look at the central network
and sub-network structures, and identify molecular communities linked to lung responses to low-dose Cd in
mice with prior RSV infection. The results will have sustained impact by providing an experimental animal
model to study interactions of low intensity exposures in lung disease and by demonstrating whether low-dose
environmental Cd interacts with RSV infection to increase lung fibrosis through disrupting the protein S-
palmitoylation mechanism, altering mTORC1 activation and increasing mitochondrial oxidative stress."
10853081,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are ubiquitous in pesticides and other industrial
products where they remain active in the environment for extended periods. Daughters of women who were
exposed prenatally to the estrogenic EDC diethystilbestrol (DES) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)
exhibit an increased risk of breast cancers. Despite a link between EDC exposure and cancer risk the
detailed mechanism(s) that ultimately drive tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. This lack of
understanding limits the ability to accurately determine the individual and population risk of estrogenic EDC
exposures. The goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism(s) that links EDC exposure to cancer
and to provide biological markers capable of evaluating EDC exposure risk.
We have identified a number of EDC-driven reprogramming events within the mammary gland stroma.
These events include increased collagen deposition that results in increased mammary gland stiffness and
decreased permeability of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Similar stromal tissue changes have been shown
to increase cancer susceptibility in animal models and appear to provide a biological connection to EDC-
driven tumorigenesis. It is our overarching hypothesis that estrogenic EDCs alter the homeostatic
signaling within the mammary gland leading to ECM changes that ultimately drive breast cancer. We
propose to test this hypothesis using a well-defined mouse model system with the following Specific Aims: 1)
Characterize the estrogenic EDC-induced mechanism(s) that contribute to breast stromal molecular and
tissue alterations. 2) Evaluate the contribution of estrogenic EDC-induced stromal alterations to breast
cancer risk. These studies will answer several key questions in the field including how the estrogenic activity
of EDCs impact stromal alterations, how stromal alterations alter tissue homeostatic signaling during
mammary gland development and determine the epigenetic reprogramming events within stromal fibroblasts
that propagate an EDC exposure from the womb through adulthood. We expect that this analysis will provide
a strong foundation for understanding how environmental EDCs drive tumorigenesis as well as provide
potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for EDC exposure."

Right ventricular remodeling leads to serious complications in congenital heart disease. Congenital
heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect. Due to improved diagnostics and surgery, 1 million
patients live in the US with CHD, many of whom develop right ventricular (RV) heart failure. Our understanding
of the underlying pathobiology and therapies are very limited, creating a pressing research need. Patients with
Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis (ToF/PS), the most common form of cyanotic CHD and the form
most available for research, develop adverse RV remodeling, leading to heart failure and arrhythmias. It has
been thought that the RV remodeling is a consequence of surgical repair. However, we have recently shown
that ToF/PS patients have decreased heart muscle cell (cardiomyocyte) division, indicating the possibility of
developing a new mechanistic paradigm of RV heart failure development in CHD.
Increased β-adrenergic receptor signaling decreases cardiomyocyte proliferation in ToF/PS. We have
taken an innovative research approach, using administration of thymidine labeled with a stable isotope tag
(15N-thymidine). Proliferating cells incorporate 15N-thymidine into their DNA, which we visualize with Multi-
isotope Imaging Mass Spectrometry (MIMS) analysis of pieces of RV myocardium. By detecting
cardiomyocytes labeled with 15N-thymidine, MIMS revealed decreased cardiomyocyte division in ToF/PS. Our
mechanistic investigations showed that overactive β-adrenergic receptor signaling inhibits cardiomyocyte
division. Our pre-clinical studies in neonatal mice and cardiomyocytes from ToF/PS infants demonstrate that
administration of the β-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol increases cardiomyocyte division. β-blockers
have been used in ToF/PS, but this use has been limited to preventing hypercyanotic spells. We propose a
randomized, placebo-controlled (1:1), double-blinded, single-center clinical trial of 40 ToF/PS infants to test
the mechanistic hypothesis that β-blocker administration in ToF/PS infants increases cardiomyocyte
division and decreases RV hypertrophy. The recent success of propranolol administration in infantile
hemangiomas and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines provide the necessary pharmacokinetics and
safety experience to support these studies in infants. As primary outcome, we will quantify cardiomyocyte
division using our innovative 15N-thymidine labeling approach with MIMS readout. As a secondary outcome, we
will characterize changes in RV and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. This initial single-center trial will provide the
foundation for future multi-center randomized controlled trials of propranolol administration in infants with
ToF/PS and other types of CHD at risk for RV remodeling, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, with the
long-term goal of preventing RV failure.
The Heart Institute at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh is ideal for this research. We have achieved the
lowest mortality of infant cardiac surgery and have the research infrastructure to carry out the proposed work."
10830973,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The functions of Natural Killer (NK) cells can be influenced by the cell-surface
glycosylation of their target cells. A subset of CD56dim NK cells expresses the Sialic acid-binding protein Siglec-
9. This subset has a high cytolytic activity; however, Siglec-9 itself is an inhibitory receptor that restrains the
cytolytic ability of this otherwise highly cytotoxic population. Harnessing the cytotoxic capacity of this population
has not been evaluated as an approach for eradicating HIV. In our preliminary studies and focusing first on NK
cells, we found that levels of Siglec-9+ CD56dim NK cells inversely correlate with CD4+ T cell-associated HIV DNA
during antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed HIV infection. Furthermore, Siglec-9+ CD56dim NK cells exhibited
higher cytotoxicity towards HIV+ cells compared to Siglec-9- NK cells. These data are consistent with the highly
cytotoxic nature of the Siglec-9+ NK cells. However, consistent with the known inhibitory function of the Siglec-9
molecule itself, blocking Siglec-9 enhanced NK cells' ability to kill HIV+ cells in vitro. Focusing next on target
cells, we found that HIV latently-infected CD4+ T cells exhibit high levels of the Siglec-9 ligand, α2-3 Sialic acid,
compared to HIV productively-infected or uninfected cells. We also developed a novel approach to block
Siglec/Sialic acid interactions during HIV infection by conjugating Sialidase (enzyme cleaves Sialic acid) to four
HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). These conjugates (in hand) can be used in conjunction with drugs
that reactivate HIV latently-infected cells to achieve a functional HIV cure. We pilot tested one of these conjugates
and found it able to selectively desialylate the surface of HIV+ cells and enhance NK capacity to kill these infected
cells in vitro. Together, our data support our central hypothesis that Siglec/sialoglycan interactions contribute
to the ability of HIV-infected cells to evade NK immune surveillance and that blocking these interactions, via
selective desialylation of HIV-infected cells, will enhance the capacity of NK cells to clear HIV-infected cells.
 In Aim 1: we will test the hypothesis that Siglec-9/Sialic acid interactions contribute to the ability of HIV
latently-infected cells to evade NK immune surveillance. In (1a), we will determine the role of Siglec-9 in the
ability of NK cells to kill HIV+ cells, and in (1b), we will determine the role of α2-3 Sialic acid in the ability of HIV
latently-infected CD4+ T cells to evade killing by NK cells. In Aim 2: we will test the hypothesis that HIV bNAb-
Sialidase conjugates reduce the size of the HIV reservoir (2a) in vitro and (2b) ex vivo, and (2c) delay viral
rebound in vivo using a modified version of the splenic-injected primary HIV-infected reservoir (SPHIR-IL15)
non-fetal humanized mouse model with high NK longevity. We also will confirm the mechanism by which bNAb-
Sialidase conjugates enhance NK cell antiviral function by examining the role of Fc-mediated functions and
Siglec-binding in NK targeting. Our interdisciplinary approach is taking advantage of recent advances in the
emerging field of glyco-immunology to enhance NK cell capacity to kill HIV+ cells in ART-suppressed individuals.
Our goal is to provide a novel mechanism and approach that can be harnessed to functionally cure HIV infection."

brain to produce the sensory and emotional experience. We will continue to build on the training program
developed through the first two funding periods of this grant around a combination of more formal coursework
and less formal training experiences designed to provide not only a solid background in pain mechanisms and
management, and a greater appreciation of the burden of pain, but in a variety of skills critical for career
development including the use of cutting edge and rigorous and statistically sound methodology, literacy in
quantitative approaches to pain research, networking, and oral and written communication. We are committed
to an integrated approach to the study of pain which is based on our belief that major breakthroughs in this
field can only be achieved through multidisciplinary approaches. This is most clearly manifest in practice
through interactions between [1] laboratories (horizontal integration) and [2] researchers and clinicians (vertical
integration). Accordingly, horizontal and vertical integration are essential components of this training program,
which consists of three core elements: 1) Research - Multidisciplinary research projects are not only
encouraged, but expected, as is exposure to clinical management of pain/pain-related problems. Horizontal
and vertical integration will be achieved both through the choice of project, shaped by a primary mentor with
input from the executive committee, and through the formation of multidisciplinary mentoring committees which
will include at least one clinical faculty member among a three to four-member committee. 2) Theory - Trainees
participate in four required for-credit courses: Mechanisms and Clinical Presentation of Pain, Pain Journal
Club, bi-weekly Current Research on Pain presentations, and Pain Models – Rationale, Testing and
Interpretation, as well as the monthly Pain Seminar Series, where trainees interact with prominent pain
researchers. These courses serve as a primary venue to address issues of scientific rigor, proper use of
statistics in experimental design and analysis, quantitative literacy, as well as reinforce issues associated with
the responsible conduct of research. 3) Practice - Trainees will be exposed to the assessment, diagnosis and
treatment of chronic pain patients through three primary venues: 1) the Mechanisms of Clinical Presentation of
Pain course includes a series of lectures directed at assessment diagnosis and treatment of specific
subpopulations/aspects of pain patients (visceral, headache, geriatric, etc); 2) One-on-one interactions with a
clinician as a member of the training committee, that is often associated with opportunities for trainees to
shadow pain physicians as they interview, diagnose and manage pain patients; and 3) Participation in activities
organized by the Challenges in Managing and Preventing Pain (CHAMPP) Clinical Pain Research Center that
involves exposure to clinical pain research, pain clinicians, and pain patients."

10823243,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pediatric asthma disproportionately impacts children who live in urban communities partly due to environmental
exposure to allergens, stress and air pollution. This project establishes a Clinical Research Center to conduct
both network-wide and site-specific clinical studies and trials with the ultimate goal of developing effective asthma
treatment or prevention approaches applicable to children residing in low-income urban settings. For a significant
number of asthma patients, guideline-directed treatment does not achieve disease control, suggesting the need,
and potential benefit, for treatment(s) that are personalized to the phenotype of these patients. As evident by
cluster analyses in adults and children, there is a group of severe asthmatics that have fewer characteristics of
type 2 inflammation and in whom type 2 cytokine-targeting biologics may be less effective. Children living in
inner-cities are exposed and sensitized to allergens, particularly cockroach, triggering type 2 inflammatory
response and exposed to high levels of indoor and outdoor irritants and pollutants which can trigger TH1 and
TH17 neutrophilic inflammation. There is a need to have a better understanding of mechanisms of non-atopic
asthma. Systemic inflammation with IL-6 as a biomarker is a mechanism that is postulated to mediate asthma
severity. IL-6 is produced by cells of the immune system and secreted by airway epithelial cells and has been
proposed as a potential target for asthma therapy. While cytokine and soluble receptor levels, as well as genetic
studies of IL-6R have been examined in relation to asthma, the intrinsic capacity for the receptor to signal within
differing phenotypic populations has not. The objective of this study is to determine whether intrinsic signaling
responses to circulating IL6 and other cytokines differs between cockroach negative, lower atopic children and
cockroach allergic, higher atopic children with moderate to severe asthma. We hypothesize that and the
relationship of IL-6 receptor signaling to morbidity. We hypothesize that genetic polymorphisms will modify
intrinsic IL-6 signaling and that IL-6 signaling will be a determinant of morbidity. The protocol will test exploratory
hypotheses that pollution and stress lead to exacerbations in those with higher intrinsic signaling.
To test this hypothesis, we propose a study designed to identify differences in intrinsic IL-6 signaling in children
with asthma. The study will include children who: 1) are between the ages of 6 and 20 years; 2) have a history
of recurrent wheeze / persistent asthma of at least one year duration; and 3) live in low-income census tracts of
U.S. inner-city communities. Studies of intrinsic IL-6 signaling and SNP carrier status will be done on peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at baseline. These studies will be done on nasal epithelial cells on a subset
of participants. We propose a 12-month follow up at 3-month intervals to prospectively determine the
relationship of IL-6 signaling to symptoms and exacerbations."
10588878,"Acute myocardial infarction (MI) continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The adult
human heart has minimal capacity for regeneration. Once damaged, cardiomyocytes (CMs) cannot be replaced
efficiently, leading to a decline in heart function and adverse remodeling. Our long-term goal is to develop novel,
clinically translatable therapeutic strategies for systemic administration that protect CMs following ischemia-
reperfusion (I/R) injury to reduce infarct size and improve clinical outcomes. Exosomes have emerged as potent
vectors for delivery of bioactive cargo for the treatment of various diseases including CVD. In large animal models
of I/R injury, exosomes derived from cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) promote cardiac repair but require
intramyocardial delivery, limiting their clinical potential. Likewise, while exosomes have demonstrated pre-clinical
efficacy, it is unclear what cargo is necessary to mediate these benefits and how it can be enhanced. To
overcome these limitations, we seek to identify innovative strategies to optimize therapeutic exosome cargo and
improve tissue and cell-specific delivery. In preliminary studies, we determined that microRNA (miR) cargo is
required for the regenerative potential of CDC-exosomes following acute MI. Furthermore, using surface
engineering, we developed CM-targeted CDC-exosomes (CMP-exos) which showed increased cardiac honing,
retention and repair compared with unmodified CDC-exos post-MI. Together, these data support the central
hypothesis that modifying the targeting capabilities and bioactive cargo of therapeutic exosomes will allow for
development of a clinically relevant systemic based therapy with enhanced efficacy in CVD. The objectives of
this proposal are to determine the specific rate-limiting miR cargo that reduces CM apoptosis in I/R, optimize
therapeutic systemic delivery using CMP-exos, and determine if CMP-exos improve efficacy in a large animal
model of I/R. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Define the role of specific
exo miRNA cargo in modulating CM cell death and cardiac function following I/R; 2) Determine the optimal dose
and route of delivery of CMP-exosomes; 3) Determine the effect of targeting CMP-exosomes to CMs on cardiac
function in a pre-clinical model of I/R. We will pursue these aims using an innovative combination of mechanistic
studies to investigate the necessity and sufficiency of specific miRs on CM cell death, novel exosome engineering
strategies with the potential for development of a systemic based strategy, comprehensive pharmacokinetic
studies, and rigorous pre-clinical evaluation in a relevant large animal model of I/R. The proposed research is
significant because it will elucidate the mechanism/s of action of a potential translational therapy and identify
therapeutic targets to reduce CM cell death in pathways operant in I/R. The proximate expected outcome of this
work is an understanding of the functional contribution of specific miR cargo and CM targeting to exo-mediated
cardioprotection. These results will have an immediate and long-term positive impact by defining cardioprotective
miRs operant in I/R and maximizing the translational potential of therapeutic exosomes through miR cargo
loading and surface protein engineering."
10862550,"ABSTRACT: In 2020, over 23,000 patients in the US will be diagnosed with Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly
aggressive brain tumor, with a dismal median survival of 15-18 months. Studies focusing on Gulf War Veterans
especially those exposed to nerve agents in Iraq in 1991 have shown a higher risk of brain tumors among
neurological diseases and a distinct neurological brain pattern as compared with the other Veterans. The
standard-of-care for GBM consists of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy combined with concomitant
and adjuvant chemotherapy. However, ~50% of GBM patients do not respond favorably to chemoradiation
following surgery. A priori identification of non-responders could allow for selection of these patients as potential
candidates for genomically-driven drug therapies (over 64 ongoing clinical trials in the US) over conventional
treatment. Further, chemotherapy costs >$100K/year. There is hence an unmet need to develop and validate
predictive biomarkers to identify up front which Veteran patients will not benefit from chemotherapy. Another
significant challenge in GBM management is the differentiation of suspicious lesions on post-treatment MRI, as
tumor recurrence or treatment-induced radiation effects. In the absence of reliable diagnosis, patients with a
benign treatment effect have to undergo an unnecessary surgical confirmation biopsy. The co-morbidities due
to unnecessary biopsies disproportionately impact Veteran GBM patients who tend to be older and have
increased comorbidity burden. Consequently, developing a companion diagnostic solution using clinical MRI
could represent a compelling solution in substantially improve quality-of-life years for Veteran GBM patients by
sparing them of the side-effects of surgery, while providing timely management in patients with tumor recurrence.
Recently, we have developed a new “Neuro-Image Risk Classifier” (NeuRisC), that uses artificial-intelligence
(AI)-driven computational features corresponding to the micro-architectural measurements of disorder in the local
intensity gradients (i.e. gradient entropy) on Gadolinium (Gd)-T1w MRI; the initial version of NeuRisC has been
shown to (a) be prognostic of GBM survival on n=203 studies (p<0.001), and (2) have an accuracy of 85% (a
37% improvement over expert readers) on n=58 studies in distinguishing radiation effects from tumor recurrence.
In this VA project, we propose to further improve, and validate the accuracy of NeuRisC by expanding our initial
feature set (using Gd-T1w MRI alone) by including (1) additional features from anatomical (T2w, FLAIR) and
functional MR sequences (perfusion), (2) a new class of biophysical deformation attributes from “normal” brain
parenchyma, and (3) peritumoral features from outside the lesion. In Aim 1, we will develop (NeuRisC)predict as a
predictive image-based marker of benefit to chemotherapy by combining intra- and peri-tumor gradient entropy
and biophysical deformation attributes from “normal” brain parenchyma. Similarly, (NeuRisC)diagnose will be
developed in Aim 2 by including lesion and peri-lesional features from pre- and multiple post-treatment MRIs, to
improve discrimination of radiation effects and tumor recurrence. Overcoming limitations in previous work
pertaining to small cohorts & lack of spatially mapped ex-vivo histology, NeuRisC modules will be validated on
a large multi-institutional cohort of >1000 studies with co-localized tissue and MRI scans obtained across multiple
biopsies/lesion. This cohort will also allow for establishing associations of NeuRisC features with underlying
histological/molecular tumor characteristics - a prerequisite for clinical adoption. Lastly, NeuRisC modules will
be deployed at Northeast Ohio & Tennessee VA Healthcare Systems to validate their utility as decision support.
On an independent cohort of N=200 MRIs from Veteran patients, interpretation results from oncologists and
radiologists at these two VA sites will be compared, with and without NeuRisC, to evaluate added benefit of
NeuRisC as decision support. Criteria for success will be to demonstrate that NeuRisC is able to (a) predict
GBM patients that respond favorably to chemoradiation with >90% accuracy, and (b) is non-inferior to accuracy
for invasive biopsies (85-90% accuracy), thereby avoiding biopsies in patients with a benign radiation effect."
10799598,"Project Summary
Cancer immunotherapy’s signature achievement is extension of overall survival with long-term durable
remissions in a minority of patients. However, the question of how memory CD8 T cells form in cancer patients
is poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to understand the relationship between cell cycle regulation
and CD8 T cell memory fate. We examined CDK4/6 inhibition in mouse and human CD8 T cells during T cell
priming and found a dramatic skewing of CD8 T cells toward a memory fate. Antigen-specific CD8 T cells treated
ex vivo with CDK4/6i displayed increased long-lived memory responses upon adoptive transfer into mice. We
further used single cell transcriptional profiling to evaluate recently activated human CD8 T cells from blood of
breast cancer patients pre- and on-treatment with the CDK4/6i palbociclib or abemaciclib. TCR clonotype
tracking and RNA velocity analysis revealed that CDK4/6 inhibition increased the ratio of central memory to
effector CD8 T cell precursors. Analysis of paired samples showed that MYC targets were downregulated by
CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy in humans, consistent with an increase in the transcriptional repressor MXD4. Our
central hypothesis is that CDK4/6 inhibition in CD8 T cells in both mice and humans augments long-term
protective immunity. To test this, we will use state-of-the-art technologies including: 1) TRP1 transnuclear mice
developed by our lab to study antigen-specific TCRs with a physiologic range of affinities for an endogenous
antigen; 2) scRNAseq and TCR clonotype tracking to analyze a large bank of longitudinal blood and matched
tissue samples from patients on a Phase II trial; 3) ChIPseq, and co-immunoprecipitations to determine the
molecular basis linking CDK4/6 inhibition to memory cell fate in CD8 T cells. In Aim 1 we will identify the
molecular mechanism linking CDK4 and/or CDK6 to induction of memory cell fate. Slowing the cell cycle using
other cell cycle inhibitors or by taking advantage of natural heterogeneity in cell division rates does not potentiate
memory formation in CD8 T cells, implying a unique role for CDK4 and/or CDK6 in conferring a memory cell fate.
We will identify the transcriptional regulators affected by CDK4/6 inhibition, with a focus on MYC and RUNX3.
Combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors with PD-1 blockade in the clinic results in unexpected treatment-limiting
toxicity. In Aim 2 we propose that a short course of CDK4/6 inhibition would successfully potentiate CD8 T cell
memory, thus allowing cessation of the CDK4/6 inhibitor to minimize or obviate overlap with PD-1 blockade. We
will test this hypothesis in mice using our TRP1 CD8 T cell adoptive transfer model, and in humans using 29
paired blood and tissue samples from a Phase I trial of CDK4/6 inhibition with PD-1 blockade. We will use high-
resolution single-cell transcriptional profiling of recently activated CD8 T cells to track individual TCR clonotypes
and their transcriptional profiles in CDK4/6 inhibitor pre- and on-treatment blood and tissue samples. Impact: A
basic understanding of the mechanistic role of CD4/6 in CD8 T cell fate decisions will allow for better design of
clinical trials in cancer or infectious disease using CDK4/6i as adjuvants to promote CD8 T cell memory."
10831484,"Abstract
The calcium and voltage regulated BK(or SLO1)-type K+ channel is a widely expressed ion channel impacting
on regulation of excitability in a variety of both excitable and inexcitable tissues. SLO1 is encoded by the
kcnma1(or slo1) gene, one of four SLO family members. The ability of SLO family channels to be regulated by
specific cytosolic ions arises from a large cytosolic regulatory domain, containing specific ion binding sites, that
is connected to the pore-forming part of the subunits. The ability of SLO family channels to respond to changes
in the cytosolic milieu makes them uniquely adapted to play negative feedback roles following activity that
leads to alterations in the cytosolic ions. The Ca-regulated BK channel is particularly fascinating, since despite
being encoded by a single gene, it is expressed in a wide variety of cells in each case playing very distinct
physiological roles. A central tenet of the work in this laboratory is that the functional diversity and the
associated broad scope of physiological roles played by BK channels arises from associated with regulatory
subunits. For BK channels, tissue-specific expression of up to four different regulatory  subunits (1-4) and
four  subunits can define BK function and physiology. Our understanding of the loci of expression, channel
composition in particular cells, and the impact of particular regulatory subunits on function and physiology
remains rudimentary. and 4 subunits have been implicated in hypertension and epilepsy, respectively, and
other indications suggest that BK channels may be therapeutic targets in stroke, hypertension, epilepsy, and
tumor growth regulation. To address the gaps in understanding of the roles of BK channels of particular subunit
composition, this lab combines methods ranging from biophysical analysis of channel properties to the use of
genetic knock-out (KO) of specific regulatory subunits. This permits evaluation not only of the biophysical and
functional properties of channels of different auxiliary subunit composition in native cells, but also how these
channels contribute to physiological roles. Furthermore, we continue to probe questions of BK channel function
pertinent to channel inactivation mechanisms and stoichiometry, guided by available structural information.
Recent work on animal models developed in this lab have established important roles of 1 and 2 subunits in
defining BK channel functions in secretory epithelial cells and inner hair cells, respectively, while -containing
BK channels influence action potential firing rates and burst behavior. Future work will further probe our
existing models, e.g., the role of 1-containing BK channels in colonic epithelium. In addition, a major focus will
be the development of animal models that will allow examination of 3-containing BK currents in native cells.
3-containing BK channels remain the least understood of all BK channel subunits and we seek to remedy that
deficit. This project is expected to provide new insight into the physiological roles of 3 and 1 auxiliary
subunits, and the roles of BK channels containing such subunits."
10817044,"ABSTRACT: The growing population of older adults with advanced cancer experiences significant
public health problems, including steep declines in quality of life, receipt of care that does not reflect
patients' values and preferences, and high rates of caregiver burden. Inadequate attention to patient
priorities and age-related concerns (e.g., function, cognition, and social support)—contribute to
morbidity in this population. The emerging field of geriatric palliative care seeks to address age-related
concerns and align care with patient goals over the trajectory of chronic and serious illness. The
overarching goal of this K24 proposal is to enhance the candidate's mentorship of students, fellows,
and junior faculty pursuing geriatric palliative care research, with a particular focus on identifying unmet
geriatric palliative care needs and developing and testing interventions to improve quality of life and
goal-concordant care for older patients with advanced cancer. As a successful mid-career investigator
with a track record of leading successful palliative intervention trials with seriously ill older patients, the
candidate is well-positioned to mentor the next generation of aging researchers. This award will
leverage an outstanding longitudinal dataset of over 400 audio-recorded `primary' palliative care visits
with older patients with advanced cancer and longitudinal patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes to
explore optimal geriatric palliative care intervention designs. The research aims are to (1) characterize
communication about age-related concerns in primary palliative care visits with older adults with
advanced cancer and their family caregivers; (2) identify missed opportunities for addressing age-
related concerns in primary palliative care visits for older adults with advanced cancer and their family
caregivers; and (3) refine a conceptual model for primary palliative care delivery that incorporates age-
related concerns and can be optimized to improve quality of life for older adults with advanced cancer.
The K24 award will provide protected time for the candidate to update and expand her mentorship
program, building bridges between researchers in geriatrics, palliative care and oncology. She will
leverage outstanding aging research and mentoring resources available at the University of Pittsburgh;
learn new skills to foster inquiry, wellbeing and resilience among trainees; and create a Junior Faculty
Visiting Professor Program for geriatric palliative care researchers. This proposal is significant and
innovative because it will support new clinical investigators using novel mentoring techniques and
develop pilot data to inform large-scale trials addressing deficiencies in quality of care for a burgeoning
population of older adults with advanced cancer. It is highly feasible because the candidate is a
committed mentor with ongoing R01 funding, from an outstanding research environment with strong
geriatrics programs and a large pool of potential mentees."

A key requirement for HIV-1 vaccine development is the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs)
targeting the HIV-1 envelope (Env) spike. The BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 soluble timer is engineered to display
conformational epitopes recognized by several bNAbs but not non-neutralizing antibodies. The prototype SOSIP
vaccine is currently being evaluated in two clinical trials. An effective messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine
expressing BG505 SOSIP.664 will complement the clinical vaccine and open a path to heterologous
immunization strategies to elicit immune responses defined by increased breadth and magnitude. Recent
achievements in mRNA vaccines is a result of advancements in nanoparticle delivery technologies. We recently
reported immunogenicity of a replicating RNA (repRNA) vaccine encoding the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-
2; this vaccine, delivered with a novel Lipid Inorganic Nanoparticle (LION) carrier, induced potent binding and
neutralizing antibodies in both mice and non-human primates. In the proposed R61/R33 application, we will
investigate and optimize attributes of the LION formulation to engineer the immunity of a BG505 SOSIP.664
expressing repRNA vaccine (repRNA-SOSIP.664). The goal is to identify a lead vaccine and administration route
that promotes B cell differentiation and maturation needed for induction of high affinity Env antibodies that confer
protection in a macaque SHIV challenge model. The proposed work will be performed with a three-way
collaboration between Dr. Amit Khandhar at HDT Bio, Dr. Noah Sather at Seattle Children’s Research Institute
(SCRI) and Prof. Deborah Fuller at the University of Washington (UW). Proposed activities in the R61 phase will
include (specific aim 1) optimizing the repRNA/LION platform for intramuscular (IM), intradermal (ID) and
intranasal (IN) delivery and (specific aim 2) screening immunogenicity of vaccine candidates in mouse and
rabbit models. In the R33 phase, we will advance (specific aim 3) one or more lead vaccine candidates to
evaluate protective efficacy in a macaque SHIV challenge model. Milestones in the R61 phase are (milestone
1) identification of formulations that target lymph nodes or remain at injection site, (milestone 2) develop an
optimized LION formulation for intranasal delivery of repRNA, (milestone 3) one or more repRNA/LION
immunization regimens that induce neutralizing antibodies greater than or equal to the BG505 SOSIP.664
protein/adjuvant vaccine. Using clearly defined go/no-go metrics for each milestone we will determine transition
to the R33 phase of the project. Milestones in the R33 phase are (milestone 1) one or more vaccine regiment
affords statistically significant protection compared to controls in a macaque SHIV challenge model as measured
by one or more protection measures and (milestone 2) one or more immune responses in vaccinated animals
correlate with one or more protection measure."
10863973,"Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can cause cardiac dysfunction and dilation, clinically termed alcoholic
cardiomyopathy (AC). While chronic alcohol abuse alone causes AC, clinical evidence indicates that alcohol
can exacerbate cardiac dysfunction resulting from other causes of cardiac injury or stress. Alcohol abuse also
increases the risk of hypertension and heart failure, with as many as one third of all dilated cardiomyopathies
attributed to AC. The development of cardiac fibrosis appears to be a key mechanism of AC dysfunction, as
fibrosis impairs ventricular filling and impedes cardiomyocyte contraction. LARP6 is an RNA binding protein
that upregulates collagen I expression post-transcriptionally by binding to the 5’SL structure and stabilizing the
mRNA. Using a genetic knock-in mouse with modified 5’SL that prevents LARP6 binding, others have shown
significantly decreased overall collagen expression and deposition in bile duct ligation-induced hepatic fibrosis.
Stefanovic and colleagues discovered a drug-like compound, C9, that blocks the interaction between LARP6
and collagen I. They demonstrated that C9 inhibits collagen I expression in cultured hepatic stellate cells and
prevented the development of fibrosis in animal models of hepatic fibrosis. Our preliminary studies indicate that
both the knock-in 5’SL mouse and C9-treated wildtype mice are resistant to the development of cardiac fibrosis
and dysfunction in response to chronic isoproterenol infusion. In the current proposal, using this unique genetic
model and C9 compound, we will determine the role of LARP6 in AC. Our long-term goal is to identify the
mechanisms responsible for alcohol-induced cardiac injury, which can then be targeted for clinical benefit. We
hypothesize that blocking the interaction between LARP6 and collagen I mRNA significantly blunts cardiac
remodeling (fibrosis and hypertrophy) and contractile dysfunction in a preclinical model of AC. Using the well-
established NIAAA chronic+binge alcohol mouse model, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1
determines whether blocking the interaction between LARP6 and collagen I in the 5’SL knock-in mice blunts
alcohol abuse-induced adverse cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. We utilize integrated and systematic in
vivo and in vitro approaches focused on ethanol-induced cardiac dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress,
apoptosis, fibroblast activation, and fibrosis. Aim 2 investigates whether pharmacological blockade of LARP6
and collagen I interaction by the small molecule inhibitor C9 inhibits and/or reverses chronic alcohol abuse-
induced cardiomyopathy. In this interventional approach, we will determine the therapeutic potential of C9 both
prophylactically and therapeutically using the NIAAA model of AC. Outcome measures include cardiac diastolic
and systolic function, ventricular chamber dimensions, collagen typing and cross-linking, inflammation,
oxidative stress, and interstitial fibrosis. Our proposed genetic and interventional studies will determine if
blocking LARP6 and collagen I interaction can blunt chronic alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy and serve as a
potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of clinical AC."

The proposed Emory Pediatrics and Pathology Stimulating Access to Research in Residency (Emory-
PP StARR) Program aims to leverage the rich infrastructure and interdisciplinary research environment at
Emory to increase the number of physician-scientists in the Pediatric and Pathology disciplines through
enhanced recruitment and retention of residents into meaningful independent research careers investigating
heart, lung, and blood health. This goal will be operationalized through the development of an additional 4-year
track within an existing Pediatrics Research-in-Residency training program and the development of a new 5-
year combined Anatomic and Clinical Pathology Residency that will accelerate research independence while
still fulfilling all requirements for clinical Board certification in either Pediatrics or Pathology. The Emory-PP
StARR Program will offer in-depth training in the fundamentals of research, will foster an Emory-PP StARR
specific mentoring program that is tailored to the training needs of resident physicians, and will build a
systematic approach for identifying and recruiting a diverse cohort of resident physicians into the Program.
Research training will combine structured curriculum sessions and flexible personalized options, with an
additional year of residency devoted to mentored research and preparation of career development award
proposals. As a result of the size and diversity of our Pediatrics Residency Program, as well as the existing
focus on research within the Pathology Residency Program, we expect to offer this opportunity to a highly
competitive pool of eligible candidates. Careful attention will be paid to matching resident-investigators with
mentors based on research interests and mentoring style, drawing from the talented pool of faculty Preceptors
dedicated to training the next generation of clinician-scientists. Faculty with NIH-funded programs in Blood and
Immune System Research, Heart Research, and Lung and Respiratory Diseases Research that address
critical challenges posed in the NHLBI’s Strategic Vision have been carefully assembled for this program. Our
Specific Aims are 1. To implement and monitor a structured research training program for resident-
investigators. 2. To foster a clinician-scientist identity among resident-investigators, including through a tailored
mentored research experience. 3. To recruit and retain a diverse group of resident-investigators. With novel
approaches to recruit, train, and retain residents, a dedicated Core Leadership Team, renowned scientists as
Preceptors, and robust institutional commitment in an exceptional research environment, the Emory-PP StARR

10784693,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Optic neuropathies are common causes of blindness worldwide, affect the lives of millions, and lack effective
treatments to restore vision. Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is an inherited optic neuropathy that
affects ~3 per 100,000 people worldwide, results in vision impairment, and has no treatment. It is primarily due
to mutations in the optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) gene, which encodes a mitochondrial dynamin-related protein critical
for mitochondrial stability and energy production. A major limitation to the development of effective therapies for
optic neuropathies is the use of animal models that poorly replicate the human condition. Particularly for optic
nerve and RGC disorders, studies would benefit from the use nonhuman primates (NHP) with optic nerve and
retinal anatomy, physiology and pathology, which closely mirrors that of humans. Consequently, well-defined
NHP models of optic neuropathy that are more predictive of human conditions are necessary to efficiently
advance new therapies. We identified rhesus macaques heterozygous and homozygous for a missense mutation
in OPA1 that demonstrate optic nerve head pallor and thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer in comparison to
wildtype controls; these findings are consistent with ADOA in human patients. We will fully define this NHP model
of ADOA and determine its impact on RGC structure and function longitudinally over a 5-year period. Specifically,
we will assess the onset and progression of retinal dysfunction utilizing electroretinography, retinal flavoprotein
fluorescence and visual testing. Importantly, we will correlate the clinical findings with detailed transcriptomic,
histologic, and immunohistochemical data for a comprehensive characterization of this NHP model of ADOA.
The ADOA transcriptome from NHPs is highly likely to identify novel genes and pathways involved in RGC
pathology and neurodegeneration as well as validate previously implicated pathways thus revealing new
therapeutic targets. We will also perform detailed histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses
to assess RGC soma, axons and dendrites as well as their mitochondrial size and number in the macula,
papillomacular bundle, and periphery of the retina. Finally, through selective breeding of ADOA-affected NHPs,
we will generate a supply of macaques heterozygous and homozygous for the OPA1 mutation for future study.
To make this new NHP optic neuropathy model available for therapeutic testing, we propose three Specific Aims:
1) To define the morphologic features and phenotypic spectrum of a NHP model of ADOA, 2) to determine the
impact of the OPA1 A8S mutation on RGC function in NHPs, and 3) to determine mRNA and protein expression
in RGCs of ADOA-affected NHPs. Once the most predictive endpoints of disease and sufficient animals with
ADOA are identified, we will pursue additional studies of etiopathogenesis and novel therapeutic strategies. This
comprehensive NHP model of ADOA will be a highly valuable resource for the vision science and
neurodegenerative disease communities."
10781947,"Patients with Barrett's Esophagus are at increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, but there is
currently no reliable way to determine who is at high versus low risk. We propose to quantify the evolutionary
dynamics in Barrett's and determine if those measures predict cancer risk. Neoplastic progression is
fundamentally a stochastic evolutionary process at the cell level. However, there are often many different
genetic and epigenetic alterations that can contribute to the development of a cancer, and the ones that evolve
in any given cancer are random. This makes it difficult to assess the risk that a pre-cancerous tissue will evolve
into cancer based simply on what mutations have occurred previously. We propose a different approach:
Measure the dynamics of cell level evolution rather than the products of that evolution. We hypothesize that the
rate of cellular evolution in a tissue should predict how likely and how quickly that tissue will evolve into a
cancer. We will test this hypothesis in Barrett’s esophagus. We propose to fit both population genetic and
phylogenetic models to data from Barrett’s esophagus biopsies spread over space and time in order to
estimate parameters of the rate of cellular evolution and test if they are predictive of progression to esophageal
adenocarcinoma. Five parameters determine the rate of evolution: 1) stem cell population size, 2) stem cell
generation time, 3) mutation rate, 4) the strength of selection, and 5) heritability of the alterations. We have
recently shown that we can measure all those parameters in clinical biopsies. We will measure all five
parameters in Barrett’s esophagus based on CpG methylation and copy number alterations using methylation
arrays, as well as single nucleotide variants identified in whole genome sequencing, in a prospective cohort of
Barrett’s patients having either stable, benign disease or validated cancer outcomes. We will use those
measures of the rate of evolution in Barrett’s esophagus to derive multivariable risk models of progression to
esophageal adenocarcinoma as well as a classification system for the types of evolution present, that are
clinically useful for the management of Barrett’s esophagus. If we are successful, we will reduce morbidity in
patients likely to progress through earlier intervention, reduce suffering and stress in low-risk patients, and
focus resources and interventions on those high-risk patients who will benefit from them. Our proof of principle
would also justify using our tools to measure evolution in other pre-cancers to predict progression. In full-blown
cancers, our measures may also predict their response to therapy and to select therapies that are matched to
the evolutionary dynamics of a patient’s cancer."

for improving oral health and reducing oral health disparity. Collaborating with Baltimore area high schools,
historically black colleges and universities in Maryland, University of Maryland Institutions, campus-wide URM
scholastic programs and student organization, including Continuing Umbrella of Research Experiences (CURE)
scholars program and Summer BioScience Internship Program (SHIP), and the Student National Dental
Association, D-REX will recruit high school and undergraduate students and science teachers strongly interested
in biomedical science to experience the 9-week one-on-one mentored research in the laboratories of UMSOD.
Twenty-six faculty members in UMSOD will serve as mentors to lead the participants through hypothesis-driven
research project intimately related to various areas of oral, dental, and craniofacial health, such as biomaterial
and tissue engineering, pain, microbial pathogenesis, cancer, and epidemiology. Additional group activities will
deliver enrichment contents, such as science lectures, career seminars, survival skills workshops, to empower
the participants to succeed in dental and medical health care and research career. The goals of D-REX are to
foster career interest in the field of unmet need and to promote awareness of dental, oral, and craniofacial
research among high school science teachers to impact high school science education broadly. D-REX program
will be integrated with the ongoing UMSOD Summer Research Training Program for dental students so that D-
REX trainees can experience research along with dental students to further motivate them in pursuing oral
health-related careers. D-REX program will be led by two program directors. One of them is currently operating
the training program at UMSOD (Dr. Ren). The other created and directed a summer high school research
science program lasting 20 years, and two international biomedical science programs for teenagers that now
have more than 100 countries as members (Dr. Myslinski). As one of the top 10 dental schools in NIH funding
for the past 12 consecutive years (most recently, $15.2M total funding, including $4.8M from NIDCR) and a #4
ranking by Blue Ridge research in 2020, the UMSOD is a diverse, inclusive and intellectually stimulating place
to nurture and motivate students in pursuing career in oral health care and dental, oral, and craniofacial research,
and to disseminate oral health science through the participation of high school teachers. The goals of D-REX
are consistent with the mission of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research."
10817801,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rationale: Most children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS), a severe form of lung
injury, require mechanical ventilation. In adults with ARDS, injurious mechanical ventilation practices increase
mortality, primarily attributed to the development of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome
(NPMODS). Pediatric studies have not found similar consistent associations between mechanical ventilation
practices and mortality. NPMODS is a feasible alternative outcome to mortality, which is low in PARDS, that
has strong biological plausibility for association with injurious mechanical ventilation and may improve
identification of mechanical ventilation associated harm in children. Before adoption of the intermediary
outcome NPMODS, as most children survive PARDS, it is crucial to characterize the association between
NPMODS and post-ICU morbidity. Research: Through this career development award, Dr. Anoopindar Bhalla,
a pediatric intensivist, seeks to understand the associations between ventilator management, NPMODS, and
post-ICU morbidity in children with PARDS. The research will leverage the infrastructure and resources of a
Phase II randomized controlled trial on a lung-protective ventilation strategy enrolling 276 children with PARDS
and led by Dr. Bhalla’s co-mentor (PI: Khemani, NHLBI R01 HL134666, REDvent). The central hypothesis is
that injurious mechanical ventilation leads to NPMODS and, in turn, NPMODS is associated with post-ICU
morbidity in children with PARDS. These hypotheses will be tested through the following Specific Aims: 1)
Determine whether a lung-protective ventilation strategy prevents NPMODS in PARDS; 2) Identify physiologic
mechanisms of injurious ventilation which are associated with NPMODS in PARDS (including assessment of
transpulmonary pressures); 3) Characterize the association between NPMODS and post-ICU morbidity
(health-related quality of life, functional status, and pulmonary status) in PARDS. Career Development:
Through completion of the proposed research, additional career development training activities, and
multidisciplinary mentorship, Dr. Bhalla will learn key skills in 1) the principles of pediatric clinical trials; 2)
advanced study design and biostatistics; 3) the assessment of post-ICU outcomes in children. Acquiring these
skills is critical for Dr. Bhalla’s long-term career goal to lead well-designed clinical trials in critically ill children.
The assembled mentorship team with world-class experts in respiratory physiology, biostatistics, and long-term
outcomes as well as clinical trials, will support her in these endeavors. Impact: This research will provide
crucial information on the associations between injurious mechanical ventilation, NPMODS, and post-ICU
morbidity to guide future PARDS clinical trials. Furthermore, through the career development training and
generated data, Dr. Bhalla will be well-positioned to successfully compete for R01 funding and become an
independent investigator leading pediatric mechanical ventilation clinical trials."

This K23 award will establish Ishani Ganguli MD, MPH as a clinician-investigator focused on
how care delivery and payment innovation can advance high-value outpatient care and better
outcomes for older adults. Dr. Ganguli is an Assistant Professor of Medicine and primary care
physician at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Building on her
clinical training, methods coursework, and experiences studying care innovation and leading it
at an Accountable Care Organization (ACO), this award will allow her to develop expertise in (1)
how aging needs, especially for those with multimorbidity and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and
AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD), can be met through outpatient care innovation, (2) advanced
quantitative methods, and (3) claims-linked electronic health record (EHR) data analysis. To
achieve these goals, Dr. Ganguli has assembled a team with expertise in health services
research on care innovation (Drs. Ateev Mehrotra, Thomas Sequist), geriatrics (Dr. Christine
Ritchie), primary care (Drs. Meredith Rosenthal, Joshua Metlay), quantitative methods (Drs. E.
John Orav, J. Michael McWilliams, Craig Pollack), and EHR data analysis (Dr. Christine Vogeli).
Primary care access and continuity of care improve outcomes for multimorbid older adults, so a
recent decline in primary care office visit rates – likely due in part to barriers attending these
visits – raises concerns. Virtual care may enable access and continuity. But we do not know
which groups faced office visit barriers pre-dating the Covid-19 pandemic nor how post-
pandemic expansion of virtual care will affect primary care access or continuity for these groups.
To address these critical questions, Dr. Ganguli will first use the claims-linked Medicare Current
Beneficiary Survey to describe visit use and visit continuity of care (COC) associated with
reported trouble getting to the doctor’s office and whether adults with AD/ADRD or social risk
factors were at greater risk of this barrier (Aim 1). In Aim 2, using difference-in-differences
analysis of claims-linked EHR data in a large Medicare ACO, she will assess how post-
pandemic expansion of virtual care affects primary care use in these populations. In Aim 3, she
will use these claims-linked EHR data to develop a novel application of the COC measure
(“touch continuity,” which includes virtual care) and determine if it is associated with risk of
preventable hospitalizations. This work and training will provide the basis for a future R01
proposal of a quasi-experimental, multi-health system study of virtual primary care for
multimorbid older adults. This K23 award and future R01 will inform how to pay for and deliver
virtual care to promote high-value outpatient care and better outcomes for older adults."

Clonal hematopoesis (CH) defined as the presence of acquired mutations detectable in peripheral blood of
normal healthy individuals without hematologic malignancies (HM) has been well characterized by sequencing
population based cohort studies. The presence of CH is associated with >12-fold risk of eventual HMs. More
data are needed to delineate disease specific and mutation specific risk as well as factors that might shape the
evolutionary trajectory from CH to HM. We have demonstrated in our prior work that participants in the WHI
who developed AML were four times more likely to harbor a mutation a median of 9.6 years before the onset of
AML compared to controls (70% vs. 30%, OR 4.0, 95% C.I. 2.5-6.3) with mutations in TP53, IDH1/2, and
spliceosome genes being highly associated with increased risk of AML and rarely present among controls. The
long-term goal is to identify both mutational and cell-extrinsic factors that contribute to the development of HM
and thus provide the basis for future clinical trials of HM interception and prevention. Published data indicate
the ability of metabolic factors and inflammation to influence the expansion of CH. Our central hypothesis is
that mutational, inflammatory and metabolic factors that predict the development of HM can be prospectively
identified, thus enabling improved risk assessment. We will utilize peripheral blood samples collected at
baseline from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) cohort that prospectively followed 168,808 women for a
median of 10.8 years. All cancer outcomes were adjudicated by central review. Our specific aims will
determine the following: (1) the risk of baseline pre-HM mutations and development of specific HM among
participants in the WHI. We will select 400 cases of HM (200 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 200
cases of multiple myeloma) along with age matched 400 controls that did not develop HM during WHI follow up
(2) To determine the impact of metabolic and inflammatory abnormalities in promoting CH expansion and
impacting the progression from CH to HM. Our study is significant because there is no known intervention
strategy to prevent or delay the progression of CH to HM and in general, prospective, randomized, controlled
trials of prevention strategies require many years of follow-up to reach definitive conclusions. Our study will
establish individuals at highest risk of HM based on mutational, inflammatory and metabolic factors and
provide grounds for monitoring people individuals with CH at highest risk of HM. Moreover, these data will
provide novel insight into intervention strategies to prevent the onset of HM. The proposed research is
innovative in investigating mutational and metabolic as well as inflammatory factors that impact the
progression of CH to HM using long term data from a large cohort of women."
10806947,"Most eukaryotic pre-mRNAs, especially in metazoans, are alternatively spliced to generate multiple
mRNAs and proteins. Given the importance of alternative splicing in regulating gene expression and enhancing
the diversity of the proteome, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of splicing and how alternative
splicing is regulated. In this project, we will study the roles of RNA binding proteins in alternative splicing, with
an emphasis on how RNA binding proteins auto- and cross-regulate the splicing their own and other RNA
binding protein genes. This work will provide new insight into the mechanisms of RNA processing and how
these proteins regulate one another to achieve homoestasis.
 Many prokaryotes encode CRISPR-Cas systems which are RNA-guided adaptive immune systems that
protects prokaryotic organisms against invaders such as viruses and plasmids. Immune memories are
encoded as short DNA sequences, called “spacers”, that match invader genomes and are stored as
interspersed elements in an array of short repeats (the CRISPR array). The CRISPR arrays are transcribed
and processed into guide RNAs which pair with Cas nucleases to recognize and degrade target nucleic acid
(interference). New immune memories are formed during “adaptation” when fragments of invader DNA are
acquired and integrated into CRISPR arrays for use in future targeting. While a tremendous amount is known
about the targeting and degradation of invading nucleic acids, much less is known about the process of
adaptation. We plan to further characterize the adaptation process in prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems. This
work will also provide insight into the mechanisms of adaptation in the immune systems of prokaryotes. In
addition to enhancing our understanding of the basic science of prokaryotic immune systems, there is
tremendous potential that this work could lead to the development of new tools that can be used for genome
editing applications.
 All of these projects will be addressed using the types of general approaches we have developed such
as splicing reporters, single cell RNA-Seq, nanopore sequencing, RNAi or CRISPR screens, and
computational genomics. We will also continue to develop additional innovative approaches to address these
issues as needed or as opportunities arise due to technical advances in the field."

Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) seeks to renew the Health Educational Research Opportunities for
Teachers (HERO-T) program, a two -year research and professional development opportunity for science
teachers, and expand the Health Educational Research Opportunity and Exploration for Students (HEROES)
enrichment program for secondary students in the Richmond, Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area. These
programs, grounded in theory, are designed based upon a combination of data derived from current literature
related to the impact of research experiences for teachers and literature on student engagement in science. The
wealth of experience of the investigators, steering committee, and advisory board members will enable the
successful implementation of this program.
The goals of the HERO-T and HEROES programs are to 1. cultivate in teachers the skills needed to conduct
cutting edge biomedical research and translate that research experience into curricula for their students and 2.
increase student awareness of and exposure to research in the biomedical sciences and foster in them scientific
investigation skills. These goals will be accomplished by:
 1. Selecting three new secondary science teachers annually (15 teachers total), HERO-T fellows, to
 participate in a two year experience consisting of two eight week summer research experiences and a
 two year professional learning community (PLC) during the school year.
 2. Providing teachers with research training, professional development, and coaching.
 3. Engaging twenty secondary students annually in the HEROES Academy (up to 100 students total), a
 monthly enrichment program to build their awareness of careers in biomedicine/ biomedical research and
 cultivate their scientific investigation skills.
 4. Selecting ten talented students annually (50 students total), HEROES scholars, to participate in the
 HEROES Externship, a one week summer research program, and the Center on Health Disparities
 Summer Research Symposium.
In the first four years of the grant, 12 teachers were trained, 83% from high-need schools and 67% from
underrepresented groups. The HERO-T fellows have developed more than 12 lesson plans from their research
to be used in an average of 2 classes per fellow per year impacting over 150 students in the first year to now
over 1,200 secondary students annually. More than $10,000 has been used to purchase laboratory supplies for
the teachers’ classes thus amplifying the long lasting impact of their research experience. Thirty-nine students
have participated in the HEROES program. Approximately 75% of the students have come from high need
schools and 80% are from underrepresented groups. This grant request is for another five years of support."
10874408,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Leading to over 270,000 deaths in the US annually, septicemia is the systemic inflammatory response to a
bloodstream infection (BSI). Early diagnosis and treatment of BSIs have demonstrated improved patient
outcomes and reduced hospitalization time. However, currently accepted diagnostic approaches require a blood
culturing step, which is not only slow, but also demonstrates reduced sensitivity in the presence of antimicrobial
treatment. Current techniques are therefore considered unreliable for monitoring effectiveness of treatment once
begun. There is a significant need for new diagnostic approaches for BSIs that are culture-free and provide
microbiological information throughout the course of care.
To address this unmet need, HelixBind will leverage the capabilities of its proprietary direct-from-specimen (i.e.,
culture-free) platform, RaPID (Resistance and Pathogen IDentification) to assess the microbial load of an
infection in response to an antimicrobial intervention. RaPID/BSI, the first test for this system, detects and
identifies BSIs directly from patient whole-blood within 3 hours. Incorporating a broad test menu with single
CFUs/ml sensitivity, the test is not confounded by polymicrobial infections nor antimicrobial treatment. Across
multiple clinical studies, the assay has demonstrated >95% sensitivity and >99.8% per assay specificity.
RaPID/BSI was designated as a Breakthrough Device by the FDA.
As a result of this program, the capability to accurately assess microbial load will be added RaPID/BSI. With this
capability in place, initial test results will provide clinicians with pathogen identification along with a measure
of load; a marker for infection severity. Combined, this information will assist clinicians in source control and
selecting the most appropriate antimicrobial intervention. Follow-up measurements will then allow the clinician
to gauge for microbial clearance, a requisite for patient recovery. Beyond the immediate, patient-specific impact,
this program will directly support improved antimicrobial stewardship as required to combat the rise of
antimicrobial resistance pathogens.
Our Specific Aims, each with quantifiable deliverables, are designed to complete all technical development,
systems verification, stress testing, and clinical validation in collaboration with our clinical partners. The focus
of this study will be to validate the capability of our innovative approach, setting the stage for further work
aimed at optimizing its implementation in the clinical setting. In achieving our Specific Aims, we will have
developed and demonstrated, a revolutionary approach towards identifying, characterizing, monitoring, and
treating invasive infections of the bloodstream."
10898546,"Abstract
One in 40 Americans are estimated to have mitral valve prolapse (MVP). This disease is characterized by
enlargement and mechanical incompetence of the mitral valve, eventually leading to billowing of the leaflets into
the left atrium during systole and failure to properly coapt. It is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality,
causing an estimated 35,000 deaths per year as well as 90,000 major surgeries in the United States. Currently,
the only treatment for MVP is surgical correction. Despite adherence to current guidelines, one in five patients
will develop new onset left ventricular dysfunction postoperatively, and this is associated with a decrease in long-
term survival. A possible cause of postoperative LV dysfunction is myocardial fibrosis (MF), which has been
described cross-sectionally in both autopsy studies of patients with MVP, as well as in MRI-based imaging
studies. However, no studies exist that have mechanistically demonstrated how MVP, myocardial fibrosis, and
LV dysfunction are linked. We have recently demonstrated that myocardial fibrosis is present with a regionalized
distribution in patients who underwent surgical repair for severe MVP. Fibrosis is localized to the inferobasal
myocardium and papillary muscles and is undetectable from apical and septal biopsies taken from the same
patients. This regionalized pattern of fibrosis was validated in genetic mouse models of human MVP. The
distribution of fibrosis within the myocardium supports our overarching hypothesis that regionalized
myocardial fibrosis is a reactive process to increased mechanical tension in the setting of MVP. In this
fellowship application, we aim to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms that translate pathogenic
mechanical forces into myocardial fibrogenesis in MVP. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that mitral valve
prolapse can cause regionalized left ventricular fibrosis. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that mechanical
stress activates fibrogenesis through a mechanosensitive-ATP-Purinergic signaling mechanism. In Aim 3, we
will test the hypothesis that integration of genomic and transcriptomic data can identify transcriptional regulators
that initiate and sustain fibrosis programs. We will take advantage of available human samples, mouse models,
and bioreactors developed by our group to define a mechano-molecular landscape underlying LV dysfunction in
MVP. Through completion of these three aims, we will identify new cellular pathways involved in mechanically-
induced fibrogenesis that could be manipulated in order to prevent or reverse myocardial fibrosis. Finally, a
better understanding of how myocardial fibrosis occurs in MVP will be clinically informative and may encourage
revision of current surgical guidelines in order to intervene earlier and decrease postoperative LV dysfunction.
Collectively, the scientific approaches and experiences outlined in this fellowship will bring me to the cutting edge
of cardiovascular research, significantly enhancing my clinical and research training, and serve as a springboard
for success as I work towards achieving my goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist."
10772137,"ABSTRACT
Clinical trials are often conducted under idealized and rigorously controlled conditions to ensure internal validity
(maximizing potential treatment efficacy) while balancing patient safety (e.g., serious adverse events [SAEs]);
but these conditions—often reflected in trials’ eligibility criteria—paradoxically, limits (1) the ability to identify the
“right” study populations of the trials, and (2) the trials’ generalizability to the target population in real-world
settings. Low generalizability has long been a concern, including for Alzheimer's disease (AD) trials. AD trial
participants are systematically younger than AD patients in the general population, where eligibility criteria design
issues are arguably the biggest yet modifiable barriers. The FDA has launched numerous initiatives to improve
trial design and enrollment practices, such as using enrichment strategies (e.g., “use patient characteristic to
select a study population in which detection of a drug effect [or safety event] is more likely than it would be in an
unselected population”), so that the trial participants can better reflect the real-world target population and the
trials are more likely to succeed. However, there are significant gaps between the need to improve AD trial
eligibility criteria design and ways available to fulfill the need in practice. On the other hand, rapid adoption of
electronic health record (EHR) systems has made large collections of real-world data (RWD) that reflect the
characteristics and outcomes of the patients being treated in real-world settings, available for research. The
increasing availability of RWD combined with the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), especially
machine learning (ML) offer untapped opportunities to generate real-world evidence (RWE) to support
eligibility criteria design for AD trials, due to a number of key methodological gaps: (1) the lack of validated
computable phenotyping (CP) and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and tools that can
accurately define the populations (e.g., AD patients) of interest and extract key relevant patient characteristics
and outcomes of interest (e.g., trial endpoints such as MoCA and safety profile such as SAEs) from RWD, (2)
the lack of ways to identify the desired study populations (and corresponding eligibility criteria), considering the
impact of criteria to potential treatment effectiveness, patient safety, and study generalizability, and (3) the need
of an easy-to-use toolbox to support trialists’ eligibility criteria design process. We propose (1) novel causal-
principled, explainable AI (XAI) approaches to generate RWE to facilitate AD trial eligibility criteria design, and
(2) to create the web-based ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE ELIGIBILITY EXPLAINER (ADEP) tool. We will leverage two
large RWD resources, the OneFlorida+ (~19 million patients from Florida, Georgia, and Alabama) and INSIGHT
(~12 million New Yorkers) clinical research networks (CRNs) contributing to the national Patient-Centered
Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). The success of this project will establish (1) a novel, generalizable, and
XAI-based trial enrichment framework with large collections of distributed RWD, and (2) a prototype toolbox that
can provide RWE to eligibility criteria design, balancing effectiveness and patient safety in the target population."

techniques, we designed the Medical College of Wisconsin Physician-Scientist Immersion Program (MCW-PSIP)
to focus on cultivating and maximizing local interest in careers as a physician-scientist in the Departments of
Medicine (internal medicine), Surgery, Anesthesia and Pediatrics. Resident trainees will be immersed in a well-
resourced and supportive program that is designed with specific milestones, training, and metrics for both
trainees and mentors and will lead to participant eligibility for certification by the American Board of Medical
Specialties. The MCW-PSIP is designed to train residents with a wide range of prior research experience, from
those with minimal prior research exposure to those with prior Ph.D. training. Our research training program
provides 23-24 months of enrollment in research blocks to fulfill programmatic requirements and expectations
and overcome challenges faced by all resident trainees as they begin laying the foundations for their academic
careers. Our goal for the proposed MCW-PSIP is to provide critically needed intensive mentoring, instill the
necessary research skills training, and provide all necessary support for resident-investigators to grow into and
thrive as independent physician-scientists either in basic or clinical and translational research. Our approach
during our first four funding years (R38HL143561) supports the success of MCW-PSIP’s methods, and lessons
learned during that time have led programmatic expansion and enhancements more fully delineated in our
application. In the short-term, the resident-investigator will acquire the knowledge and critical skills needed to
lead and complete a research project and produce presentations and publications that will be necessary to
successfully compete for a full range of training awards, including K38 and K08/K23 awards. Long-term, for our
institution, this pathway will serve as a feeder for its sub-specialty programs in Medicine, Surgery, Anesthesia,
and Pediatrics. We further expect long-term, successful candidates will join a cadre of physician-scientist junior
faculty at MCW or another academic institution in the U.S.
Our proposal has two specific aims:
Aim 1: To expand, recruit, and execute the MCW Internal Medicine Physician-Scientist Immersion Program for
the development of physician-scientists through the R38 mechanism
Aim 2: To quantify the success and challenges of the MCW Internal Medicine Physician Scientist Program

Inward Rectifier K+ channels (KIR) play key roles in the operation of cells in neuromuscular and other tissue.
Pathogenic variants are linked to numerous neurological, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders. Although
some variants cause gating defects in KIR by altering ligand regulation or ion permeation, there is growing
evidence that many –perhaps most– variants cause defects in folding and trafficking of KIR. Despite the central
role for folding and trafficking in the disease etiology, there have been to date no comprehensive large-scale
studies that determine sequence and structural determinants of KIR trafficking and functional robustness. Here
we provide the first comprehensive assessment of missense and topological mutations’ effects on KIR trafficking
and function. Acquisition of these data is the required first step to build quantitative biophysical model of the
sequence, structure, and function relationship in KIR. These models will be useful to understand the mechanistic
basis for KIR mutation phenotypes, to predict their pathogenicity, and to identify new treatment strategies for KIR-
linked disorders. These models will also pave the way for rational engineering of KIR as chemogenetic reagents
that can be used to study functional roles of K+ channels in intact tissues."

PI3’-Kinase (PI3K) signaling is critical for proper angiogenesis, the development of new blood
vessels. However, aberrant PI3K signaling is associated with a wide range of vascular
malformations (VMs), including venous malformations which can arise from somatic activating
mutations in PIK3CA. VMs are failures in proper endothelial cell development and
differentiation giving rise to dysfunctional blood vessels that leave affected patients with
significant morbidity and often disfigurement. Our long-term goal is to better understand the
molecular etiology of vascular malformations with the hope of contributing novel approaches to
the treatment of these conditions non-surgically. We have developed in vitro and in vivo models
of PIK3CA-driven VMs and find that the mTORC1 axis may be a critical component of improper
vascular morphogenesis. Our central hypothesis is that the mTORC1 axis is being regulated
through a novel mechanism; the induction of the mTORC1 regulating protein RHEB. This
proposal seeks to determine the role of RHEB in driving malformations arising from PIK3CA
mutations and reveal molecular insights into the mechanisms by which RHEB/mTORC1 axis
promotes the development of vascular malformations."
10833558,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) training programs have been shown to reduce stress and improve a
broad range of stress-related disease outcomes in initial randomized controlled trials (RCTs). For example,
there is initial evidence from small RCTs that MBIs reduce symptoms in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
patients. Yet we know little about the underlying active treatment mechanisms of mindfulness training.
Guided by a theoretical and conceptual model of the active treatment elements of MBIs, called Monitor and
Acceptance Theory (MAT), we recently showed in two published dismantling MBI RCTs that acceptance
skills training is critical for driving stress reduction effects in healthy stressed community adults. Specifically,
standard MBI programs with attention monitoring and acceptance skills training were superior in reducing
stress relative to parallel MBI programs that did not include acceptance skills training (or to control groups) at
post-treatment. We observed consistent stress reduction effects across intervention delivery approaches in
these two dismantling trials, using either a 2-week remote smartphone MBI or with an 8-week group-based
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) MBI treatment approach. Here we propose the first
translational trial of this mechanistic account, examining whether acceptance skills training drives stress
resilience and improved symptom outcomes in IBS patients. In the largest and most well-controlled RCT of
MBI training in IBS to-date (N=325), we will evaluate whether a smartphone MBI program (with attention
monitoring and acceptance skills training; Monitor+Accept, MA-MBI) reduces daily life stress and IBS
symptoms at post-treatment and two-month follow-up, relative to a matched MBI program with acceptance
skills training removed (training in attention monitoring skills only; Monitor Only, MO-MBI) or to an active
stress management training control group (Coping Control, CC). Participants will not only provide clinician
and patient assessed measures of IBS symptoms at the three time points, but they will also provide sensitive
experience sampling assessments (using Ecological Momentary Assessment) of their stress and symptoms
in daily life at each time point. Finally, as an exploratory aim, participants will provide stool samples at
baseline and post-intervention to provide the first ever test of whether MBIs can alter the gut microbiome in
IBS. Guided by a conceptual model, the proposed study will experimentally evaluate whether acceptance
skills training is a key ingredient for stress reduction and health benefits in IBS patients, and will provide an
important mechanistically-focused evaluation of the active treatment elements of MBIs for at risk stressed
patient populations. We believe that this trial not only can help identify a new accessible and scalable
evidence-based treatment for IBS patients, but the mechanistic focus will also help the field advance more
effective and efficient acceptance skills-based mindfulness training approaches among at-risk stressed
patient populations."
10837645,"How the brain and spinal cord transform neuronal activity into coordinated movement is a central question in neuroscience. Corticospinal neurons, the principle output of motor cortex, project to the spinal cord, where they shape motor output by synapsing on a diversity of spinal interneurons. Corticospinal neurons also send axon collaterals to the striatum, where they synapse on two populations of neurons with opponent roles in motor control. Intuitively, cortical projections the spinal cord and the striatum should be coordinated in the cell types they target, in order to direct coherent motor output. Experimentally addressing this possibility been restricted by an inability to map, measure, and manipulate interconnected circuits defined by their synaptic targets. Our narrow understanding of how these motor control circuits are coordinated has undoubtedly limited clinicians’ ability to treat movement disorders that originate in brain dysfunction, particularly Parkinson’s disease and dystonia.  In this proposal, I will use recently developed technologies to uncover the anatomical and functional organization of cortical outputs to the basal ganglia and the spinal cord, and how these circuits are coordinated during movement. This proposal is organized in three Aims split across a K99 training phase and an R00 independent phase. In the first Aim, I will combine anatomical and electrophysiological tools to map the organization of synapses made by corticospinal neurons in both the spinal cord and the striatum. Experiments in this Aim will uncover a circuit through which these motor control structures are coordinated. In Aim 2, I will use two-photon imaging methods to define the logic by which corticospinal neurons, and their cellular targets in basal ganglia, encode salient features of movement. Finally, in Aim 3, I will combine anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral tools to determine how corticospinal neurons with collaterals in the striatum influence circuits in the spinal cord to shape motor output. Critically, experiments in all three Aims will capitalize on innovative technology developed and mastered at Columbia University, as well as interactions with expert collaborators.  This work will be conducted in the newly developed and thriving Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute under the supervision of Drs. Rui Costa and Mark Churchland. Their technical and professional mentorship, along with that of expert collaborators in the Institute, will ensure I am fully equipped to lead a successful research program as an independent investigator. The experiments outlined in this proposal will become the foundation for my research program as an independent investigator and will have profound basic science and clinical implications for our understanding of motor control."
10821487,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 The purpose of an internal circadian clock is to generate a series of phases - time markers across the
day and night by which different aspects of physiology and behavior (e.g., sleep, hormone release,
temperature elevations) may be aligned to local time for optimal efficiency. We know a great deal about the
molecular mechanisms of the clock (the timekeeping system) and how it is sensitive to local time. We know
much less about circadian output, and specifically how the clock generates multiple phases across the entire
solar day. Such phases are used by other clock cells, and by non-clock bearing downstream cells and
circuits. Our laboratory studies circadian neurophysiology and the overall goal of this project is to understand
the generation and usage of different circadian phasic outputs. The work is performed in the model system
Drosophila. It builds on observations and a model we created from our past studies of the neural circuit in
the Drosophila brain that controls daily locomotor behavior. In the fly brain, ~150 dedicated circadian
pacemaker neurons direct daily rhythmic physiology and behavior. These 150 pacemakers are highly
synchronized: they all tell the same time. Our model features the cell-intrinsic molecular clock in all
pacemakers directing a morning phase of heightened neuronal activity. Yet, different subsets of pacemakers
are not all active in the morning, but at different and stereotyped times of the day and night. The diversity of
active periods (circadian phases) is generated primarily by cell interactions (especially neuropeptide
modulation) and together these activity periods represent the multi-phasic outputs of the pacemaker system.
Overall, this research program aims to extend and test this model by providing a cell- and molecular-level
understanding for how circadian phase information is transmitted beyond the pacemaker system and
received by downstream target circuits. Our work in Drosophila will likely inform our understanding of
circadian output in the mammalian brain, and will also be relevant more generally to the mechanisms of
neural circuit modulation by neuropeptides."
10812379,"Summary
Over the past decade, advances in ancient DNA (aDNA) have provided striking new insights into human
history, including conclusive proof that modern humans admixed with now extinct hominins, such as
Neandertals and Denisovans. In the last cycle of funding, we pioneered methods to identify and interpret
introgressed hominin DNA that still segregates in the genomes of modern humans. Analyses of these surviving
archaic lineages shows that admixture among hominins was common, there was both positive and negative
fitness consequences to gene flow, and introgressed sequences have functional and phenotypic effects.
Despite these insights, there are many fundamentally important questions that remain to be addressed. The
major barriers to a more comprehensive understanding of archaic hominin admixture include the need for
further development of computationally efficient methods to find introgressed sequences, their application to
more globally diverse populations, and experimental studies to delineate the molecular and functional
consequences of gene flow. We will address each of these issues in the renewal project. Specifically, in Aim 1,
we will extend and refine methods for identifying introgressed DNA sequences. Such further methodological
development is necessary to improve power, reduce false positive rates, and be computationally efficient
enough to analyze massively large sequencing data sets. In Aim 2, we will leverage our access to several
large-scale sequencing projects and apply these novel methods to whole-genome sequence data from over
100,000 geographically diverse individuals. Importantly, by specifically constructing a diverse panel of
individuals, particularly from understudied populations, we will be able to make inferences about archaic
hominin admixture not previously possible. We will also develop methods to comprehensively analyze the
population genetics characteristics of introgressed sequences and test hypotheses such as the fitness effects
of admixture, sex-biased patterns of gene flow, and admixture with unknown (or “ghost”) lineages. Finally, in
Aim 3, we will perform the first systematic and comprehensive experimental analysis of adaptively introgressed
loci using cutting-edge gene editing and functional genomics technologies. The successful completion of the
proposed project will extend our understanding of admixture events between archaic and modern humans,
provide insight into how introgression has shaped extant patterns of human genomic diversity, and facilitate the
molecular discovery and characterization of previously unknown archaic groups that have contributed to the
modern gene pool."

HSPA1A is a stress-inducible seventy-kilodalton heat shock protein that plays essential roles in tumor cell
survival. This protein also localizes at the cell-surface and the extracellular medium of stressed and cancer
cells. HSPA1A-membrane positive tumors are resistant to radiation therapy, show increased invasiveness, and
develop distant metastasis, while membrane-bound and extracellular HSPA1A exert both immunostimulatory
and immunosuppressive functions. Recent research revealed that HSPA1A's membrane localization depends
on its selective interaction with specific lipids and the protein's extracellular transport is mediated by several
mechanisms including exosomes, secretory lysosomes, and lipid rafts. However, the trafficking of HSPA1A
towards the cell surface, the relationship between membrane-bound and extracellular HSPA1A, and the
specific lipid or protein modifications that trigger HSPA1A's re-localization remain unknown. To answer these
fundamental questions, we propose to characterize the trafficking mechanism of HSPA1A's membrane
translocation by determining the mechanism by which lipid interactions recruit HSPA1A to endosomal pathway.
This objective will be achieved by determining the re-localization pattern of HSPA1A in different subcellular
compartments after heat shock using subcellular fractionation and imaging, and depleting specific endosomal
lipids with drugs or lipid-biosensors. Furthermore, we will determine whether HSPA1A's extracellular transport
depends on its membrane localization and binding to specific lipids. To this end, we will delineate the
relationship between membrane-bound and extracellular HSPA1A, and then measure extracellular HSPA1A in
the presence or absence of the endo/exosomal pathway inhibitors and lipid-biosensors. Lastly, we will
characterize the lipid composition alterations and post-translational modifications on HSPA1A that affect its
membrane localization. To determine these changes, we will characterize the dynamics of the lipid composition
in stressed-cells, using a targeted lipidomics approach, and identify the differentially expressed lipid modifying
genes. Additionally, we will determine whether specific post-translational modifications on HSPA1A are
responsible for the increased membrane-bound HSPA1A using a targeted proteomics approach. This proposal
will provide fundamental knowledge that will form the basis for future interventions to control membrane-
associated and extracellular HSPA1A aiming to decrease tumor survival and increase the immune response.
Furthermore, this project will train multiple non-traditional and first-generation undergraduate and master level
students, and will prepare them for diverse careers in science."

In this program, we propose to determine the correlates of protection in individuals that spontaneously clear
multiple HCV infection episodes. This will give highly valuable information for the design of next generation of
vaccines. Our goal to assess the role of antigen-specific T and B cell responses in infection outcome and to
generate an efficacious immune response by vaccination strategies in non-human primates based on emulating
successful resolution of natural re-exposure and re-infection in human patients.
This U19 proposal consists of 3 Projects and two Cores consisting of an Administrative Core A and a Clinical
Core B. The Administrative Core A will provide two functions: (i) provide overall administrative oversight and
support for the Program and (ii) provide biostatistical analyses and data management support for the individual
projects and Cores. This Administrative Core will be led by Dr. Grakoui at Emory University and will provide the
coordination necessary to make effective and efficient use of resources and intermediate results from this
collaborative effort. The primary function will be to facilitate scientific interactions between the Project leaders as
well as Core leaders. The administrative component will provide the leadership to ensure milestones are met,
assessment of the Core functions, modification of scientific goals, incorporation of any new collaborators,
decisions of ongoing prioritization and reallocation of resources. Critical decisions will be made in consultation
with the Project leaders and program official at NIH. The Administrative Core will file annual reports to the NIH.
The Administrative Core will maintain budgets and oversee any re-budgeting that is needed to meet program
goals. The biostatistics portion of the Administrative Core will provide data management and statistical support
for the three projects. In addition, the Biostatics portion will establish and maintain appropriate database,
management and analysis in response to investigators' requests. In order to provide services to meet the
analytical challenges the Core will include facilitating methodologies necessary for addressing complex statistical
issues encountered in various research projects. In addition, provide essential metrics between the clinicians,
scientists and biostatisticians. Having resources dedicated to the biostatistics and data management needs for
the research proposed here, will add enormous value to the quality and productivity of the research conducted
by the Investigators and to disseminate this information correctly to the scientific community."

Abstract
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a virus that infects the liver and is transmitted through contaminated blood. HCV
infection is still a public health priority and a major cause of liver disease worldwide, especially in developing
countries like Egypt. New HCV infections are also on the rise in North America in association with the opioid
epidemic. While new antiviral drug can cure >95% of infected individuals, many do not know that they are
infected and remain at risk of developing liver disease and an active source of new infections. Furthermore,
successful treatment does not prevent reinfection if the individual is re-exposed to the virus. Hence, there is an
urgent need for vaccines that can protect against this virus. Unfortunately, despite our knowledge about the
immune response against HCV, we still do not have an effective vaccine. Recent results from the only vaccine
candidate that made it into a large scale (Phase 2) clinical trial did not show any protection in people who inject
drugs at risk of HCV infection. This means that we need to understand better the immune factors and cells that
protect against HCV in cohorts of patients who are able to clear the virus spontaneously. The main goal of this
proposal is to define these factors that are essential to achieve protective immunity. The aim of this clinical core
is to oversee and manage two cohorts of subjects that are infected with HCV to define these protective immune
factors. The first cohort is located in Montreal and is a cohort of people who inject drugs who were able to clear
two subsequent infections with HCV, a response that we would like to simulate in a vaccine. This cohort is
already established (15 years), will recruit new subjects throughout the project and already has banked samples
from many reinfection cases to start the projects right away. It will also include a smaller subcohort of PWID,
primarily infected with genotypes 1 and 3, undergoing antiviral treatment. The second is a large cohort of
individuals undergoing antiviral therapy for HCV from Egypt, the country with the highest number of HCV
infections in the world. This second cohort is primarily infected with genotype 4 and will allow us to understand
whether curing HCV infection using antiviral treatments will enhance these protective immune factors and cells.
By collecting well defined blood samples and clinical data about disease progression and virus from these
precious cohorts, we will be able to study the HCV-specific immune response and identify the immune factors
that should be targeted in novel vaccines."

overarching goal of this proposal t is to define these factors that are essential to achieve protective immunity.
The aim of this specific project (Project 1) is to characterize the role and functions of a subset of white blood
cells known as helper CD4 lymphocytes in a group of PWID who are constantly being exposed to the virus where
some are able to clear it several times and others that cannot. We will identify the differences in those who clear
the virus repeatedly and those who cannot. We will also compare the immune response in individuals who clear
the virus spontaneously versus those who clear it post treatment to determine if they are less protected against
HCV if they are re-exposed to it. We will use two unique cohorts of subjects, a PWID cohort from Montreal,
Canada and a cohort of subjects undergoing antiviral therapy from Egypt, the country with the highest prevalence
of HCV. The results obtained in this project will be complementary to Project 2 that will examine the antibody
response to HCV in the same subjects. We will use the latest technology to examine the immune response at
the functional and genomic level and identify cellular pathways and key molecules that are implicated in the
development and maintenance of a protective immune response. We will attempt to use chemical compounds
to correct the defects observed in those who are unable to clear the virus. Such compounds may be combined
with different vaccine candidates, as described in project 3, to enhance their immunogenicity and protective
capacity."
10835034,"Project 2. B Cell-Mediated Protection Against HCV Reinfection
Prevention of HCV infection remains an important public health objective even with the recent adoption of highly
effective antiviral therapies. A vaccine to prevent HCV persistence is needed to stem an emerging epidemic in
susceptible populations. Recall responses to secondary viral infections naturally emulate the protective immune
mechanisms associated with vaccination against viral antigens. Our findings suggest that spontaneous resolvers
may possess antigen-specific B cells that become readily activated by T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and expand
rapidly following HCV antigenic exposure. However, resolution of secondary HCV infection is low in individuals
cured of persistent HCV infection by DAAs, despite an initial burst of HCV-specific CD4+ T cells at the start of
DAA treatment. Such contrasting recall responses between these two scenarios implicate profound phenotypic
and functional differences in antigen-specific memory T and B cell responses between DAA-treated versus
untreated, resolving individuals.
We propose to elucidate the differences in antibody recall responses between individuals who spontaneously
resolve primary infection and subsequently either clear their secondary HCV reinfection (SR/SR) or develop
persistent infection (SR/CI). We will also compare these responses to those of DAA-treated individuals who are
cured of persistent HCV infection. We will analyze longitudinal samples from two separate cohorts of HCV
infected individuals for these studies. One cohort consists of people who inject drugs (PWIDs) recruited from
Montreal, Canada, who spontaneously resolve primary HCV infection but have different secondary reinfection
outcomes. The other cohort consists of individuals from Egypt who cleared persistent HCV infection following
DAA treatment (HCV-cured). We hypothesize that SR/SR PWID mount a more accelerated and sustained
memory B cell response that produces early, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that contribute to faster
clearance, while delayed antibody responses from SR/CI PWID or HCV-cured individuals fail to suppress viremia
early, facilitating viral escape from neutralization. We propose the following aims:
Aim 1. Determine the phenotypic and transcriptional profiles of bulk and antigen-specific memory B cells from
primary resolvers who were reinfected but experienced divergent infection sequelae.
Aim 2. Evaluate neutralizing efficacy and breadth of HCV-specific antibodies from resolvers with contrasting HCV
reinfection outcomes.
Aim 3. Determine phenotypic and functional changes in B cells of DAA-treated individuals before and after viral
clearance."
10835039,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) continues to infect ~71 million people worldwide with an estimated 1.5 to 2 million new
infections each year. A complete eradication of HCV infection warrants development of an effective vaccine that
can rapidly induce a durable anti-viral immunity and prevent infection. Evidence from spontaneous controllers
suggests that a broad and durable HCV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses are critical for effective control
of HCV infection. In addition, a protective role for neutralizing antibody against viral glycoproteins E1&E2 has
also been implicated. Furthermore, it is critical generate anti-viral immunity in the liver (the primary site of virus
replication). Thus, the primary goal of this proposal is to develop a vaccination strategy using DNA, modified
vaccinia Ankara (MVA), and protein-based vaccines that will generate a robust and broad HCV specific T and B
cell responses in blood and liver against multiple HCV proteins. We hypothesize that induction of a strong, broad,
and persistent T cell response against HCV antigens in the blood and liver combined with induction of strong
neutralizing antibody response will provide protection against HCV infection and different combinations of
DNA/MVA/protein vaccination can be harnessed to achieve the desired protective immunity. We propose to
achieve these objectives using 3 specific aims. In Aim 1 we will construct and characterize DNA and MVA
vaccines expressing HCV core, NS3-NS5 and E1E2 proteins. In Aim 2 we will optimize the DNA/MVA vaccine
modality for inducing strong T cell and antibody responses. The optimizations will include testing the E1E2 in
two forms either presented on the virus-like particle (VLP) or secreted. In addition, we will test the influence of
CD40L adjuvant on cellular and humoral immunity. In Aim 3 we will optimize E1E2 protein boosts for DNA/MVA
vaccine for further enhancing the antibody responses. By completion of these studies we hope generate an
optimal vaccine against HCV that induces strong T cell and neutralizing antibody responses."

Action potential initiation and propagation in myelinated axons requires high densities of ion channels
clustered at axon initial segments (AIS), nodes of Ranvier, and a robust axonal cytoskeleton to help axons
resist mechanicial injury. AIS also function to maintain neuronal polarity and regulate the distinction between
axonal and somatodendritic domains. Unfortunately, disruption of these domains and the cytoskeleton during
disease or after injury dramatically impairs nervous system function. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms
that control the assembly, function, and maintenance of AIS, nodes, and axonal cytoskeleton remain poorly
understood. Since any therapeutic approach aimed at nervous system repair or regeneration must include the
reassembly or preservation of axons, AIS and nodes of Ranvier, a detailed mechanistic understanding of their
structure, mechanisms of assembly, and composition is urgently needed. To this end we developed proteomic
approaches to perform a molecular dissection of AIS and nodes of Ranvier; these experiments will yield AIS
and node 'interactomes.' To determine the functions of identified proteins we will perform rigorous gain and
loss of function studies using modern molecular, imaging, genetic, and electrophysiological methods. Building
on our previous research accomplishments and our discovery that mechanisms of node assembly converge on
ankyrin and spectrin cytoskeletons, we will also determine the functions of these enigmatic, yet essential,
cytoskeletal proteins using conditional knockout mouse models that we have developed. Together, we expect
these studies to reveal key molecular mechanisms responsible for the assembly, maintenance, and function of
axons. These discoveries may reveal targets and mechanisms that can be used for therapies to repair or
preserve axon function."

DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 3A (DNMT3A) has emerged as a key regulator of hematopoiesis. We showed
that loss of DNMT3A inhibited hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation while favoring self-renewal,
establishing the paradigm through which the myriad effects of somatic DNMT3A mutations in humans are
currently viewed. DNMT3A is the most frequently mutated gene in clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and a critical tumor
suppressor. While the broad importance of DNMT3A is clear, the mechanisms through which it participates in
HSC differentiation remain poorly understood. A major long-term interest of my lab is to unravel the
molecular mechanisms of DNMT3A function. In the previous 4-years of funding, my lab has contributed to
advancing our understanding of DNMT3A in multiple facets, including discovery of immortalization of phenotypic
HSCs with DNMT3A loss, uncovering the complex interactions between DNMT3A and TET1 and TET2,
description of epigenetic alterations with human mosaicism, and DNA methylation canyons as sites of very long-
range interactions. In the next phase, we will build on this work, exploring the mechanisms through which
DNMT3A functions in HSCs. We will dissect the distinct roles of DNMT3A isoforms in regulating HSC
differentiation and gene expression using unique knock-out mice. We will also examine the mechanisms through
which stability of DNMT3A protein is maintained and the impact on hematopoiesis. Our preliminary data indicate
that about 1/3 of DNMT3A mutations that contribute to CH lead to loss of protein stability and we have identified
an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex putatively involved in its turnover. These studies offer the opportunity to modulate
degradation of mutant and WT DNMT3A with potential therapeutic impact. Finally, we will examine the basis of
cell competition of DNMT3A mutants in the context of both bone marrow and during development. Using cells
with different DNMT3A mutations with distinct predicted fitness, we will generate bone marrow chimeras and
investigate the relationship between loss of DNA methylation activity and the degree of competitive advantage.
We will also generate embryo chimeras and examine the contribution of mutant vs WT cells to multiple tissues
and lineages. These studies will reveal fundamental principles governing cell competition and thus insights into
clonal hematopoiesis and stem cell dynamics. Overall, the proposed work will advance our understanding of
clonal dynamics in hematopoiesis and the role of DNMT3A in maintaining proper hematopoiesis. The studies
could ultimately lead to strategies to modulate clonal dynamics in pathologic conditions."
10824249,"US adults are sedentary for ~11-12 h/day - which greatly increases cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
mortality risk. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans have expanded beyond promoting moderate-
vigorous physical activity and now also advocate for reductions in sedentary time. Accordingly, there is strong
interest in elucidating simple, cost-effective methods to reduce sedentary time. The popular press and
corporations seeking to capitalize on health trends have perpetuated the notion that simply standing in place is
a healthful alternative to sitting. Consequently, standing and sit-to-stand desks are the fastest growing
employee benefit in US workplaces. However, there is a paucity of evidence documenting the health benefits
of standing. As such, despite public perception that standing is a healthful alternative, it remains absent from
physical activity guidelines, with concerns raised that standing could be more harmful then sitting. The goal of
the proposed study is to comprehensively evaluate purported benefits (cardiometabolic) and risks (vascular
damage to lower limbs, musculoskeletal pain) that may be incurred with standing and its accrual pattern in the
highest risk group in the US - African Americans living in the stroke belt. The prospective association between
objectively-measured standing time and the 2-year change in a composite CVD risk score (comprising glucose,
triglycerides, cholesterol, blood pressure, waist circumference) will be evaluated (Aim 1). Multiple novel
standing pattern variables (e.g. distribution, length, and regularity of standing bouts) will be investigated to
identify which aspects of standing are most associated with the 2-year change in CVD risk score (Aim 2). State
of the art analytic techniques will be used to evaluate if reallocating time from sedentary to standing would yield
CVD risk score reductions (Secondary Aim). Prospective associations between standing time/patterns and the
2-year change in the ankle-brachial index (ABI, an index of peripheral vascular disease) and musculoskeletal
pain symptoms, and the cross-sectional/prospective predictors of standing will also be examined (Exploratory
Aims). To address our study aims, we will leverage the infrastructure of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), an
exclusively African American cohort study. A fourth JHS exam is scheduled to be conducted in 2020-2022 and
will include assessment of CVD risk factors. For this ancillary study, we propose to add a 7-day accelerometer
protocol (with posture detection), ABI assessment, and questionnaires to this exam for 1,250 participants. We
furthermore propose a follow-up visit 2 years later to re-assess these measures and CVD risk factors. Findings
will (1) inform probable cause and effect associations with respect to standing and health outcomes, (2) identify
optimal patterns of standing that should be promoted, (3) establish endpoints for future trials promoting
standing, and (4) identify predictors of standing that can serve as intervention targets. We view this project as a
critical next step that will provide foundational evidence important for success of future trials and ultimately
public health efforts targeting sedentary behavior in African Americans and other population groups."

The overall objective of this project is to determine the impact of social stressors on epigenetic
age acceleration and chronic health disparities and to test whether the social environment,
individual health behaviors, and race/geography/SES modify or mediate the association
between traumatic stress and health (disparities), directly or indirectly through biologic age
acceleration. We expect that the trauma burden will impact chronic diseases through DNA
methylation (DNAm) age acceleration. The WaTCH cohort is an important, highly trauma-
exposed sample of women uniquely poised for a third wave of data collection that continues
assessing trauma exposure, depression, PTSD, social context, physical health, and collection of
an additional blood specimen eight years after the baseline to examine of DNAm age. Aim 1 will
investigate disparities in psychological health (PTSD, depression), physical health (diabetes,
hypertension, and cancer), and DNAm age acceleration as women age, particularly as
influenced by cumulative trauma burden. Aim 2 will examine the influences of contextual
variables, including social capital and financial strain, that may mediate or moderate the effects
of cumulative trauma burden on adverse psychological and physical health outcomes. Aim 3 will
explore the mediating effects of DNAm age acceleration on physical and mental health
outcomes.
The proposed study will use the WaTCH cohort of 2800 women exposed to the Deepwater
Horizon Oil Spill in coastal Louisiana in 2010. It will entail the third wave of data and
biospecimen collection and incorporate data already gathered through two previous waves of
data collection. Self-reported health data on demographic, income and financial stressors, oil
spill exposure, neighborhood context, social capital, health behaviors, trauma history,
psychological symptoms, and physical health will be collected through telephone interviews.
Repeat blood samples will be collected from up to 1058 women with baseline samples."

Genetic studies indicate a strong (97%) association of narcolepsy with HLA-DQA1*01:02/DQB1*06:02
(DQ0602), weaker associations with HLA-DP and class I HLA- A*11:01, and effects in other immune related
genes such as the TCR αβ loci. The disease is caused by the loss of hypocretin (HCRT)/orexin neurons, as
loss of HCRT or HCRT receptors recapitulates symptoms in animal models. Results from our laboratory and
from others indicate that a critical step in the disease process is a CD4+ T cell autoimmune response targeting
HCRT itself, notably a DQ0602 restricted response to the amidated, C-terminal end of secreted HCRT
peptides (HCRTNH2). Indeed, increased T cell response to HCRTNH2 presented by DQ0602 is observed in
narcolepsy (our observation), followed by a broader CD4+ T cell responses to other HCRT fragments presented
by other HLA class II molecules (other investigators), a result of epitope spreading. This is likely followed by a
CD8+ T cell response to HLA class I presented antigens that results in hypocretin cell death and life-long
narcolepsy. Unique to narcolepsy, a known environmental factor, the flu, has been associated with initiation of
the autoimmune process. Indeed, an increased incidence of narcolepsy in children has been observed
following the 2009-2010 pH1N1 Influenza pandemic in China and following vaccination with Pandemrix (GSK),
an AS03 adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 2009 (pH1N1) vaccine, but not other vaccines. These observations
indicate that epitopes within the pH1N1 virus and vaccine can precipitate narcolepsy in some individuals,
findings substantiated by the fact narcolepsy patients have increased T cells binding NP17-31 and pHA273-287, a
flu hemagglutinin fragment with significant HCRTNH2 sequence homology. This mechanism is also supported by
our preliminary data suggesting TRAJ24 and TRBVB4-2 involvement in pHA273-287, NP17-31 and HCRTNH2 TCR
responses, as these TCR segments are modulated by SNPs associated with narcolepsy. In this application,
we will further characterize antigenic differences in Pandemrix, Arepanrix and Focetria, vaccines used in the
2009-2010 pH1N1 vaccination campaign, capitalizing on the observation that they have differential risk for
precipitating narcolepsy. Our hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, is that Pandemrix contains more
pHA273-287 peptide, the main mimic of HCRTNH2 autoimmune responses. In addition, we will continue isolation
and characterization of Pandemrix/H1N1 reactive and HCRTNH2 DQ0602 restricted CD4+ T cells. Our
hypothesis is that we will ultimately discover pHA273-287/HCRTNH2 and other flu/HCRT cross-reactive cells that
use TRAJ24 and TRBVB4-2 segments. Finally, we aim to characterize the phenotype of the corresponding
pathogenic cells through single cell sequencing. This high impact study is expected to eventually lead to a)
demonstration of molecular mimicry in narcolepsy and b) improved safety of influenza vaccines."

Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (UCPPS) is a debilitating condition afflicting 10 million men and
women in the U.S. UCPPS encompasses two highly prevalent chronic urologic pain disorders, interstitial
cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) in men and women, and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain
syndrome (CP/CPPS) in men. UCPPS prominently manifests as debilitating symptoms characterized by
urinary urgency, frequency, and pain. Unfortunately, the biological mechanisms contributing to UCPPS
symptoms remain unclear. This delays diagnosis and limits therapeutic development. Using a mass
spectrometry-based metabolomics approach, we recently found that elevated urinary etiocholanolone sulfate
(Etio-S) levels identify a high symptom score subgroup of female UCPPS patients. We hypothesize that
elevated Etio-S is symptomatic of a more general perturbation of related steroids. We also hypothesize that
this represents just one of multiple UCPPS subgroups arising from biochemically distinctive etiologies. In this
study, we will use state-of-the-art targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches to discern UCPPS-
associated biochemical signatures in human specimens from the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of
Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) research network. Rigorous chemical identification will connect these results to
specific physiological processes, providing the basis for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Targeted
metabolite assays of samples from these studies will be used to identify treatment-responsive subgroups in
clinical trials, improving UCPPS patient care. An experienced interdisciplinary research team of physicians,
analytical chemists, and mathematical data scientists has been assembled to ensure the rigor and clinical
validity of this effort."

Although conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental disorder with present research primarily focused on infants
and children, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has increasingly been recognized as a lifelong condition with the
potential to have a detrimental impact on adult functioning and quality of life. Based on clinical observations that
mid-to-older aged adults with ASD may be particularly susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases during aging,
the proposed studies will test the central hypothesis that the cerebellum and basal ganglia are selectively
disrupted in adults with ASD aged 40 to 60 years. And, this disruption is associated with neuromotor impairments
and clinical signs of movement disorders. Free-water diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (FWdMRI) will be
applied to quantify neuronal degeneration of the cerebellar lobules, dentate, and basal ganglia nuclei and axonal
integrity of cerebellar peduncles to determine whether these subcortical targets are disrupted in adults with ASD
relative to age-, sex-, and IQ-matched controls. Functional MRI (fMRI) of precision grip will be used to quantify
abnormal activations of cortico-subcortical brain targets and whether these alterations underpin grip force
production-related impairments in ASD. Using neuromotor tests sensitive in detecting alterations of the
cerebellum and basal ganglia, we will clarify the extent to which performance of Romberg stances, quick step
initiation, sit-to-stance balance, and goal-directed finger-pointing is compromised in adults with ASD. Guided by
strong preliminary data, we will pursue three specific aims: Aim 1) Determine structural alterations in the
cerebellum and basal ganglia in adults with ASD using FWdMRI. Aim 2) Determine functional deficits in the
cerebellum and basal ganglia in adults with ASD using motor fMRI. Aim 3) Determine neuromotor impairments
in adults with ASD. Our group is uniquely qualified to undertake this critical R01 project as it includes investigators
with expertise and experience in sensorimotor neurophysiology in ASD, ASD diagnosis, aging and movement
disorders, MRI physics and research, and biostatistics. This proposal is scientifically innovative as it will be the
first to systematically quantify aging-related neuromotor issues in ASD at the levels of brain, behavioral, and
clinical domains. This project is significant as it holds the promise to identify putative non-invasive traits of
subcortical brain targets contributing to aging in ASD. If successful, this work will identify new brain and
biobehavioral targets that can be tracked to understand, monitor, and treat aging-related conditions in ASD."
10833113,"Homologous recombination in meiosis is essential for genome integrity during sexual reproduction, but is also a
powerful determinant of genome evolution and puts cells at risk for mutation and chromosome rearrangements.
Meiotic recombination initiates with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) made by Spo11. Cells ensure that DSBs
are made at the right times, places, and numbers to maximize repair efficiency and minimize risks of deleterious
outcomes. This research program aims to understand the molecular mechanisms of meiotic DSB formation and
of the processes that regulate DSBs and recombination. Mouse and the yeast S. cerevisiae will be used to
explore these critical aspects of chromosome biology. Specific areas of inquiry include the following:
· A complex network of pathways controls the number, timing, and distribution of DSBs. In one pathway, the
DNA damage-response kinase ATM inhibits formation of additional breaks. A second pathway suppresses DSB
formation in places where homologous chromosomes have successfully engaged one another. An important
challenge is to understand the mechanisms underlying these pathways.
· DSB locations are nonrandom, and this DSB “landscape” has important consequences for heritability and
genome stability. The factors shaping the DSB landscape remain poorly understood, but recent advances inform
mechanistic hypotheses about the roles of both chromosome-intrinsic and trans-acting factors. These hypothe-
ses will be tested using powerful methods for mapping DSB distributions genome-wide at nucleotide resolution.
· An essential step in the repair of DSBs by recombination is the exonucleolytic processing of DNA ends, but
little is known about the mechanism. An innovative new whole-genome assay for DSB resection will be exploited
to define how resection is carried out, how it is regulated, and how it overcomes the barrier to nucleases posed
by chromatin.
· Erroneous, non-allelic recombination between repetitive DNA sequences yields chromosome rearrange-
ments that can be passed on to offspring. Recent work identified genomic locations in mice that are prone to
such errors and developed tools to characterize and quantify rearrangements. Important challenges now are to
understand the mechanisms of this mutagenic recombination and to understand how cells avoid these errors.
· In male mammals, segregation of the sex chromosomes is especially challenging because the X and Y chro-
mosomes share only a small region of homology (the pseudoautosomal region, or PAR) within which recombi-
nation must occur. Defects in PAR recombination cause sterility or sex chromosome missegregation. Recent
work has revealed that the PAR develops complex, dynamic structures during meiosis. Cis- and trans-acting
factors critical for this behavior have also been uncovered. Key questions will be addressed concerning the
mechanisms that ensure sex chromosome recombination and segregation."
10830287,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Endometriosis is estimated to affect 10% of reproductive age women. It results in considerable morbidity with
chronic and debilitating pain, which substantially affect the quality of life of women and their families. Because
it is an estrogen-dependent disorder, hormonal therapies are available for the medical treatment of
endometriosis. However, these hormonal treatments along with laparoscopic surgery are often of limited
efficacy with high recurrence rates, frequent side effects, additional costs, and potential morbidity. Thus, a
critical need exists to develop new and effective therapies for endometriosis targeting biologically important
mechanisms that underlie pathophysiology of this disease. Endometriosis is known as a chronic inflammatory
disease. Aberrant inflammatory dysfunction contributes to development and progression of the disease. We
have recently determined a small molecule, niclosamide (Niclo) that could serve as a potential new effective,
non-hormonal, fertility-sparing option for the treatment of endometriosis. We have demonstrated that Niclo
reduces growth and progression of endometriosis-like lesions (ELL) via inflammatory signaling using a mouse
model of endometriosis. Our studies show that large peritoneal MΦ (LPM) are increased in the peritoneal fluid
(PF) of ELL mice and invaded into the ELL. Elevated LPM populations in the PF are reduced by Niclo. Niclo
also inhibits aberrant inflammation established in the PF, ELL, pelvic organs (uterus and vagina) and dorsal
root ganglion (DRG), as well as MΦ infiltration, vascularization and innervation in the ELL. Therefore, we
hypothesize that understanding the complex chronic inflammatory mechanisms associated with endometriosis
is crucial to develop a new therapeutic strategy and provides the rationale for targeting immune dysfunction.
The objective of this application is to test this hypothesis by examining: 1) how loss of LPM impacts
pathophysiology of endometriosis, 2) how ELL induction alters the functionally heterogenic population of ELL
and peritoneal exudate cells, and how their inflammatory dysfunction is inhibited by Niclo and 3) how inhibitory
interactions from Niclo correlate with pain-related symptomology. Niclo is an efficacious Food and Drug
Administration-approved drug for the treatment of helminthosis in humans that has been used for decades.
Thus, drug re-purposing of Niclo could result in a rapidly-distributable, fertility-sparing and effective non-
hormonal therapy that has fewer side effects than current treatments."
10841403,"The Ras pathway is one of the most commonly deregulated pathways in human cancer,
yet there are still no effective therapies for Ras-driven tumors. In this application we will
be studying two genetically distinct Ras-driven malignancies: NF1-mutant nervous system
tumors (MPNSTs) and KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancers. Specifically, we aim to elucidate
an important mechanism by which these Ras-driven cancers are protected from MEK
inhibitors and will use this insight as a basis for developing and testing rational
combination therapies. Collectively, these studies will reveal novel insight into innate
mechanisms that protect these tumor types from Ras pathway inhibitors and will also lead
to the development of several new therapeutic strategies that can be translated into clinical

10843902,"ABSTRACT
Allogeneic T cell responses against foreign host antigens mediate graft-versus-host disease, the most
serious complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). During the course of this
proposal we defined a critical role for Notch signaling in the regulation of pathogenic alloreactive T cells
that mediate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in multiple mouse models of allo-HCT. Notch inhibition in
donor T cells led to long-term protection from GVHD morbidity and mortality. Using monoclonal antibodies,
we identified a critical role for Notch1/2 receptors in T cells and Delta-like1/4 (Dll1/4) Notch ligands in the
host, with dominant effects of Notch1 and Dll4. Dll1/4 blockade with a short course of antibodies emerged
as the most promising strategy to target Notch signaling while avoiding systemic side effects of pan-Notch
inhibition. We recently uncovered several remarkable features of Notch regulation in T cell alloimmunity
that warrant further investigation. First, we identified specialized radioresistant stromal cells lineage-traced
with a Ccl19-Cre transgene as the critical source of Notch ligands in secondary lymphoid organs at the
onset of GVHD. These findings uncover a central role for fibroblastic stromal cell subsets in GVHD. Second,
short-term inhibition of Delta-like Notch ligands within days after allo-HCT was essential to confer long-
term protection from GVHD in multiple mouse models. Within this early time window, Notch induced unique
transcriptional effects during the activation of alloantigen-specific T cells that impacted selected aspects of
their differentiation. Third, we studied Notch ligand inhibition in a non-human primate allo-HCT model that
mimics human transplantation. A single dose of anti-DLL4 antibodies had marked single agent activity to
prevent GVHD, showing highly conserved effects of Notch signaling from mice to non-human primates. In
both models, we observed an increased ratio of regulatory to conventional T cells in the gut and striking
protection from intestinal GVHD, the most dangerous component of acute GVHD. We hypothesize that
alloantigen-specific T cells engage in early interactions with specialized subsets of fibroblastic stromal cells
expressing Delta-like Notch ligands, inducing a Notch-driven pathogenic and gut-homing program in T cells
that promotes GVHD. To explore this hypothesis, we will identify individual subsets of fibroblastic stromal
cells that present Dll1 and/or Dll4 Notch ligands to donor-derived T cells early after allo-HCT, map the
anatomical sites that support Notch activation in alloreactive T cells, and define the impact of immune-
mediate injury on the subsequent integrity of stromal networks in secondary lymphoid organs. In addition,
we will identify mechanisms that blunt the accumulation of Notch-deficient T cells in the gut, thus preventing
intestinal GVHD, and investigate the early transcriptional effects of Notch signaling in alloreactive T cells.
These studies will bring novel insights into the regulation of alloimmunity and might lead to the development
of new approaches to limit damaging consequences of T cell reactivity after allogeneic transplantation."
10863826,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 For a protein-coding gene to perform its cellular function, it must first generate RNA transcripts that are
expressed at the appropriate level and properly processed. This is no small feat when one considers that RNA
polymerase II can prematurely terminate and that nascent transcripts can be acted upon by a variety of RNA
processing machines, including ones that yield mature transcripts lacking a canonical 5' cap or 3' poly(A) tail. A
major focus of our laboratory has thus been to identify and characterize novel “non-canonical” processing
pathways that can act on nascent RNAs. Here, we propose to build upon our recent work to study two such
mechanisms that are widely employed across eukaryotic genomes. First, we will mechanistically dissect how
the Integrator (Int) complex catalyzes premature transcription termination at hundreds of protein-coding
genes. Integrator was long known to be critical for the biogenesis of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), but we
recently showed that Integrator also binds to many protein-coding loci and attenuates production of their full-
length mRNAs, in some cases by more than 100-fold. This is because the IntS11 RNA endonuclease directly
cleaves nascent mRNAs, triggering degradation of the transcripts and premature transcription termination.
Nevertheless, it remains poorly understood how Integrator is assembled, regulated, and recruited to protein-
coding genes as most of the other subunits in the complex have no known function and lack obvious paralogs
or known protein domains. Our preliminary data indicate that non-catalytic Integrator subunits have distinct
roles at snRNA vs. protein-coding gene loci, and thus we will characterize in detail how these subunits are
recruited and function. Crosslinking mass spectrometry will further be used to define physical interfaces
between Integrator subunits, thereby revealing novel insights into how Integrator is globally assembled and
controlled. Second, we will investigate why many protein-coding genes generate circular RNAs with
covalently linked ends. Some of these non-canonical transcripts are greater than 10-fold more abundant than
their associated linear mRNAs. This suggests the main function of these genes may be to produce circular
RNAs, but the physiological functions of almost all mature circular RNAs remain unknown. We thus will use
high-throughput screening coupled to detailed biochemical studies to identify critical functions for circular RNAs
and their underlying molecular mechanisms. We further will systematically identify factors that modulate
circular RNA levels, especially post-transcriptionally, as very little is currently known about how the fate and
decay rates of these transcripts are controlled. Characterization of these key regulatory mechanisms will not
only provide important insights into endogenous circular RNAs, but may also ultimately enable circular RNAs to
become novel long-lasting therapeutic modalities. In total, these innovative studies will reveal new,
fundamental insights into how the Integrator complex and circular RNAs are regulated and control protein-
coding gene outputs to impact normal and diseased states."
10811664,"Pre-term birth (PTB) is a major cause of neonatal mortality worldwide, associated with high morbidity due to
infectious and other complications. Identifying risk factors for adverse birth outcomes, as well as the likely
causes, will facilitate prevention measures to mitigate these outcomes. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the
highest burden of these adverse pregnancy outcomes, and also bears the brunt of the global HIV epidemic,
with over 33 million people living with HIV. Untreated maternal HIV infection has been shown to be associated
with spontaneous PTB in some but not all studies. Antiretroviral (ARV) drug treatment during pregnancy
dramatically reduces perinatal HIV transmission but has also been linked to adverse birth outcomes. Here, we
will utilize our completed and ongoing cohorts of pregnant women in Cape Town, South Africa, and build on
our previous phase 1 NIH-SAMRC funding (R21 HD083344), to study the impact of HIV/ARV exposure on
female genital tract microbiology and metabolome and the relationship with placental immune pathways that
impact infant health: prematurity and post-partum vaccine immunogenicity. The specific aims are 1) To identify
vaginal microbial and metabolic markers for adverse birth outcomes in HIV-infected women. Here, we
hypothesis that PTB is associated with specific vaginal microbial communities leading to alterations in
metabolic pathways that can result in cell stress and subsequent placental inflammation. We will use 16S
rRNA sequencing and unbiased mass spectrometry to measure vaginal microflora and metabolites during
gestation. 2) To interrogate immune cell subsets and gene expression pathways in placental decidual and
villous tissue which lead to PTB in HIV-infected pregnancies. We hypothesize that placental T cells are
skewed away from regulatory towards inflammatory and activated states through HIV/ARV exposure, leading
to increased risk of preterm labor. We will use a combination of multiparameter flow cytometry, imaging and
RNAseq to characterize T cell populations, their tissue location and function. Placentas from HIV-uninfected
women will be used as controls. 3) To identify decidual immune cells and gene expression pathways that
influence infant cellular immunity. We hypothesize that inflammatory conditions at the fetal-maternal interface
contribute to the development of compromised vaccine-specific immunity post-partum. We will measure infant
BCG T cell responses in the first two months of life and relate this to placental cell phenotype, function and
gene expression in mother-infant pairs. Identifying risk factors for adverse birth outcomes, as well as the likely
causes, will facilitate prevention measures to mitigate these outcomes.

With the burgeoning of the fields of immunology and immunotherapy in the last few decades, the use of
pharmaceutical products, biomedical devices, and biomaterials in immunological research and clinical
applications has rapidly expanded. Accordingly, there has been an increasing need for engineers trained with
the quantitative skills necessary for developing effective immunotherapies and translating these developments
to industry. Immunology is a basic science that has a lot of applications that need to be translated to positively
impact patients' lives. Most companies working in this area of ImmunoEngineering hire basic scientists since
immunology is a basic science, albeit one that has a lot of applications amenable to translation in order to
positively impact patients' lives (e.g. anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs, avoiding transplant
rejection, adoptive cell therapy for cancer treatment). However, these individuals do not have training in
engineering nor quantitative or systems perspectives. In contrast, engineers are also hired into companies that
work in ImmunoEngineering areas, but often they do not have immunology training. The pre-doctoral training
program described in this application is aimed to better equip engineers by training them in immunology (as
well as in engineering). Funding for four trainees per year is requested for five years. Through this
ImmunoEngineering training program, a new type of engineering doctoral trainee is being developed, one who
can apply engineering principles with knowledge of immunology to make impacts on new treatments for
disease and who will fill a critical gap in existing bioengineers entering today's work force. This training
program will furthermore provide translational medicine and ethics training to equip trainees with important
“soft skills” such as project and time management, ethics and understanding of the translational aspects of

10911009,"This is the second renewal of our Global Mental Health (GMH) Research Fellowship: Interventions that Make a
Difference. GMH implementation science (IS) aims to decrease the vast GMH treatment gap both in low- and
middle-income countries (LMIC), where 75-85% of populations have no access to MH care, and in low-resource
settings of high-income countries (HIC), including the US, where 35-50% have no access to MH care. MH
disorders are the leading causes of global health-related burden across both sexes, the entire lifespan, and world
regions. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has globally increased MH disorder prevalence, worsened the social
determinants of health (SDoH) that drive MH disparities, and disrupted the existing health care system. Multiple
evidence-based interventions (EBIs) that reduce the impact of MH disorders exist; however, because EBI scale-
up has not been a global or US priority, there has been no reduction in global prevalence of MH disorders since
1990. In this renewal, we maintain our goal of training Fellows to use IS to address the challenges of scaling up
prevention and recognition of MH disorders and optimizing access to efficacious MH treatment in low-resource
settings. With its theoretical rigor, methodological innovation, and practical application, our program leverages
extensive facilities at Columbia University, our US and Global partners, and distinguished researchers in the field
to provide training to the next generation of GMH scientists with a 2-fold focus: First, Deployment-focused
intervention research, in which we train Fellows to contextually adapt and develop MH EBI that are ready to be
deployed in resource-poor areas with community collaboration (e.g., patients, relatives, advocates, providers,
administrators, and policy makers) while addressing SDoH driving MH disparities among underserved
populations; Second, Intervention dissemination, implementation, and services scale-up, to address MH
disparities, associated SDoH, and disruptions of the care system. Fellows will learn to examine how MH EBI
can be implemented for sustainable scale-up in low-resource settings in the US and LMICs. With robust
mentorship, hands-on experience (i.e., pilot projects focusing on sustainability), GMH IS didactic instruction, and
training to excel as competitive researchers (e.g., writing scientific papers, competing for grant support), we will
maintain a cohort of 4 Fellows, each with a 3-year appointment, and with new appointments made as Fellows
graduate. The Program now will 1) Promote health equity by identifying mechanisms driving MH disparities and
increasing access to quality MH EBI care among underserved populations; 2) Improve SDoH driving MH
disparities; 3) Improve public MH system preparedness to proactively address pandemics; and 4) Foster
enhanced research collaboration among the next generation of junior investigators from HICs and LMICs. In
addition, we have added an Underrepresented Minority Medical Student (URMMS) Short-Term Summer
Research Fellowship in GMH IS to stimulate a workforce pipeline of greater inclusion and diversity in GMH IS."

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are a family of essential enzymes that catalyze the first
reaction in protein biosynthesis, namely, the charging of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) with their cognate
amino acids. Due to the importance of protein synthesis in most cells, it is not surprising that
almost all aaRSs family members have been linked through bi-allelic mutations to human
diseases that often affect multiple organ systems. Interestingly, human aaRSs also have wide-
ranging non-enzymatic functions regulating many important biological processes. Therefore, in
principle, regulatory functions of aaRSs could also be involved in the disease mechanism.
However, the challenge lies in the difficulties to dissect the impact of regulatory functions from
that of the enzymatic roles. In addition to being in the cytosol where protein synthesis occurs,
aaRSs are frequently detected in the extracellular space, such as in cell culture media and in the
systemic circulations of humans and mice. Yet, the physiological significance of extracellular
tRNA synthetases remains unknown. This project aims to investigate pathophysiological function
of extracellular tRNA synthetases. We focus on a selective group of aaRSs linked to a specific
neurodegenerative disease – Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) – through dominant mono-
allelic mutations. Under the support of GM for the last 10 years, we established that the
extracellular presence of glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS or GARS; the first and the most
prominent CMT-linked aaRS) is relevant to the disease and we identified specific cell signaling
pathways dysregulated by CMT-causing GlyRS mutants. Our future research will investigate the
involvement of a particular signaling pathway in all aaRS-linked CMT subtypes and uncover
extracellular roles of aaRS in the normal cell signaling process."

The median survival time of glioblastoma multiform (GBM) patients is only 15 months from initial
diagnosis, making it the most aggressive and lethal form of adult brain tumor. The World Health
Organization (WHO) classifies GBM as a grade IV tumor (the highest grade), and only 5% of the
GBM patients survive 5 years or longer after diagnosis. The poor prognosis and high mortality
rates of GBM are due, in part, to the stem-like tumor-propagating cells present in the GBM.
Although these GBM stem-like cancer populations are believed to contribute to therapeutic
resistance and cancer recurrence, the underlying mechanism of stem cell induction and
maintenance, is not fully understood. The ultimate goals of this proposal are to identify stem-
specific genes controlled by two key transcription factors and develop novel DNA methylation
technologies to eliminate GBM stem populations. The transcription factors SALL2, SOX2, OLIG2
and POU3F2 are required for reprogramming differentiated GBM cells into stem-like tumor
propagating cells. Of these proteins, only SALL2 appears to physically interact with SOX2. This
will be the first investigation to evaluate the pathological consequences of the interaction between
SALL2 and SOX2, identifying its target genes and determining their roles in driving GBM stem
populations (Specific Aim I). In addition, this will be the first experimental approach to precisely
target the SALL2 promoter for methylation, blocking its expression and thus eliminating GBM
stem-like cancer cells (Specific Aim II). Completion of these aims will substantially increase our
understanding of how GBM stem-like cells are induced and maintained. Our innovative
approaches will facilitate the development of novel methylation-mediated therapeutics to block
therapeutic resistance and inhibit tumor recurrence by specifically suppressing GBM stem-like
populations."

Substance Abuse Disorders Research Training (SummerSART) at Charles R. Drew University
(CDU) and UCLA builds on the highly successful SART grant (R25DA050723, funded in April
2020) that, in turn, built on 15 years of DIDARP/MIDARP program (PI: Friedman) in which 159
mostly minority students received a meaningful research experience in substance use disorder
fields along with training and mentorship. This summer grant proposes to provide hypothesis-
driven research, courses for skill development and mentorship to eight undergraduates in
established training programs at CDU that require a research project/thesis as well as other
undergraduate students throughout the country with the goal of training the next generation of
substance use disorder researchers. Trainees will be allowed to choose a mentor from one of
21 senior substance use disorder researchers at CDU and UCLA and will also have the option
of one community faculty mentor that will help the trainee with dissemination and community
engagement, one of the specialties of CDU.
Training will include four 2-hour long research institutes, five 90-minute webinars in hot topics in
substance use research, a four-part UHI research training course, special seminars, a weekly
journal club in substance use research and a four-part responsible conduct of research series.
All programs are designed to inspire and provide the trainee skills so that they are more
competitive in their future careers in substance use disorder research.
We expect this summer R25 grant will train the next generation of substance use disorder

 CHAMACOS is a longitudinal cohort study of Latino mothers and children from a California farmworker
community who have been followed for more than 20 years to assess the impact of environmental exposures
and social determinants on children’s health and development. CHAMACOS mothers were enrolled during
pregnancy in 1999-2000; they and their children have been seen regularly since then. Over the past two
decades, we have amassed a rich trove of behavioral, health, and exposure data from this cohort. Our active
biorepository houses 330,000 biological (e.g. blood, urine, breastmilk, hair, saliva, teeth) and environmental
samples (e.g. dust, allergens) that we continue to mine for new insights in environmental health. We also hold
two decades’ worth of data on children’s neurodevelopment, lung function, physical growth, pubertal timing,
cardiometabolic health, and psychosocial functioning and mental health into young adulthood. The cohort
currently consists of almost 600 mothers (1st generation) and their 20-22 year old young adult children (2nd
generation), some of whom have begun to have children themselves (3rd generation). We propose to begin
data collection on the 3rd generation of participants, providing an unprecedented opportunity to assess, under
future funding, multigenerational epigenetic effects of environmental exposure and social determinants in a
well-characterized Latino cohort.
 Under the previous R24, we continued our strong community engagement that is vital to retention of the
cohort; facilitated new research partnerships; improved our data sharing capabilities, protocols, and
transparency through a web-portal; and maintained a strong Biorepository that is poised to address new
research questions. In the next phase of this project, under the U24, we will expand on this important work by
enriching our cohort with additional data on social determinants of health; laying the groundwork to enroll the
3rd generation of CHAMACOS participants; and promoting scientific and workforce diversity through
collaborations with Hispanic-Serving Institutions and students and clinicians from Latino farmworker
communities. We will expand resource sharing by making our data publicly available through an open-access
data repository and promote sharing of biological and environmental samples through our web portal.
Additionally, as the CHAMACOS founders move into retirement, we will transfer the leadership of the cohort to
a new generation of investigators to ensure its continued, long-term success.
 This cohort represents a wealth of resources that should be maintained, enriched, and shared for future
research opportunities. It has an engaged Latino participant population that allows scientific insight into an
underserved population and provides opportunities to engage young Latino students, clinicians, and junior
faculty to build the pipeline of future environmental health researchers."
10830286,"Abstract/Summary
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a spectrum of pathologies ranging from simple steatosis to
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH – steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning and inflammation, with or without
fibrosis). Highly prevalent in obese and diabetic patients, NASH is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular
disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, devastating diseases that are more prevalent in veterans than
in the general population. Women of reproductive age have lower rates of NASH; however, this protection is lost
after menopause when NASH rates equal or exceed those for men. Both clinical and experimental data indicate
that estrogen plays a major role in protecting women against NASH. Moreover, the protective effects of estrogen
may also extend to men via tissue-dependent aromatization of androgens to estrogens. Despite this knowledge,
the precise tissue-specific mechanisms for estrogen-mediated protection have not been directly investigated.
This proposal will focus on the interrelationship between estrogen and growth hormone (GH), specifically at the
level of the hepatocyte, where published literature and preliminary data generated by our group have led to the
HYPOTHESIS that the estrogen receptor, ER, as well as the GH receptor (GHR), are required to slow NASH
development in part by sustaining hepatocyte Stat5b activity. Studies will compare male and female mice with
adult-onset, hepatocyte-specific, knockdown of the estrogen receptor, ER or GHR alone, or in combination to:
SA1 Determine the role of ER in hepatocyte Stat5b action and its impact on hepatic function and physiology in
the presence and absence of GHR-mediated signaling; SA2 Determine if hepatocyte ER protects against diet-
induced NASH, in the presence and absence of GHR; SA3 Determine if hepatocyte ER and/or GHR play a role
in tamoxifen (TAM) induced NASH progression. Endpoint analysis includes assessment of 1) GH-axis function,
whole body metabolism, liver lipid content and pathology, 2) Hepatic response to acute GH challenge (western
blot analysis of downstream intracellular signals and 3) Hepatic cell-type specific gene expression using single
nuclei RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq), a technique that provides important information on the potential crosstalk
between cell types within the liver, critical for NASH development. The outcomes of this project will generate
new mechanistic insights to identify future drug targets to prevent NASH progression in both male and female
veterans."
10773124,"Glomerular podocytes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of glomerular diseases including diabetic
nephropathy(DN). Accumulating evidence suggests that cGMP signaling has podocyte protective effects in
kidney diseases. Generation of cGMP is stimulated by nitric oxide (NO) and natriuretic peptides (NPs) such as
atrial NP (ANP), brain NP (BNP) and C-type NP (CNP). In podocytes, cGMP generation is potently stimulated
by NPs. In contrast, podocytes are minimally responsive to NO. Thus, NPs are the predominant source cGMP
generation in podocytes. NPs induce cGMP generation by binding to the NP receptors (NPRs) NPRA (binds
ANP and BNP) and NPRB (binds CNP). An important regulator of NP actions is the NP clearance receptor
(NPRC), which binds and degrades ANP, BNP and CNP. Pharmacologic blockade of NPRC inhibits binding of
NPs to NPRC, which potentiates NPRA- and NPRB-induced cGMP generation. Moreover, NPs have direct
podocyte protective actions in vivo because podocyte specific knockout (KO) of the ANP receptor (NPRA)
augments glomerular injury in a proteinuric mouse model. Our preliminary studies found that: 1. Podocytes
express NPRA, NPRB and NPRC. 2. NPRC is highly expressed in podocytes and significantly limits cGMP
generation by locally available NPs. 3. Both ANP and CNP protect podocytes from apoptotic stimuli, 4.
Podocyte specific knockout (KO) of NPRC reduces albuminuria in a model of type 1 diabetes (Akita mice), 5.
Pharmacologic blockade of NPRC potently promotes podocyte protective cGMP generation in vitro and in vivo,
and 6. Pharmacologic blockade of NPRC decreases albuminuria in Akita mice. Based on these observations,
we hypothesized that blocking clearance of NPs by NPRC will enhance local NP levels, promote podocyte
protective cGMP signaling and ameliorate DKD. Two specific aims are proposed.
Aim 1: Examine podocyte specific NPRC KO in DKD. These studies will KO NPRC specifically in
podocytes. Subaim 1A will study constitutive NPRC KO in Akita mice. Subaim 1B will complement subaim 1A
by studying inducible NPRC KO in Akita mice with established disease. Podocyte protective mechanisms of
NP signaling will be studied in kidneys of KO and wild type mice (WT), and in cultured podocytes.
Aim 2: Examine pharmacologic blockade of NPRC in Akita mice. Aim 2 will use the ANP analogs ANP(4-
23) and AP811to inhibit NP clearance by specifically binding to NPRC without binding NPRA or NPRB and, in
turn, enhance the effects of NPs. We will then study the effects of NPRC blockade in Akita mice. Subaim 2A
will determine the most effective drug for further study (proof of concept). Subaim 2B will study Akita mice with
established disease. Thus, these studies examine the translational potential of the treatment approach."
10804604,"The cerebral pial collateral circulation is the most important predictor of outcome from acute ischemic stroke.
Patients with good collateral status on imaging at the time of occlusion have more salvageable tissue, smaller
ischemic cores, and better neurological outcome after large vessel occlusion (LVO). In contrast, patients with
poor collaterals have worse outcome even if recanalization is achieved. Pial collaterals are a network of
leptomeningeal anastomoses (LMAs) that maintain perfusion to the penumbra, a region with constrained blood
supply that is potentially salvageable if reperfusion occurs. Our overall goal is to understand the function of LMAs
and develop treatments that sustain or increase penumbral flow during LVO, especially under conditions that
have poor collateral perfusion such as chronic hypertension. Our previous study found that LMAs from
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were highly vasoconstricted and responded to pressure with robust
myogenic constriction that persisted in vivo during middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) used to mimic LVO.
This was in contrast to LMAs from normotensive Wistar rats that were more vasodilated and had little basal tone.
Our central hypothesis is that hypertension promotes vasoconstriction of LMAs and impairs flow-mediated
dilation that limits perfusion to the penumbra during LVO. Our preliminary and published data support a role for
angiotensin II (Ang II) and plasminogen activated inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as underlying mechanisms of hypertension-
induced vasoconstriction of LMAs through direct inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Aim 1
will determine the role of Ang II, PAI-1 and the transient receptor potential vanilliod 4 (TRPV4), a shear stress-
responsive ion channel, in mediating collateral flow in normotensive and hypertensive male and female rats. We
will also investigate mechanisms of impaired collateral flow and LMA dysfunction during chronic hypertension.
Our preliminary data also found that induced hypertension – acutely increasing blood pressure to enhance
collateral perfusion during LVO – increased collateral flow in normotensive rats that was limited in SHR, likely
due to vasoconstricted LMAs. However, vasodilation with a PAI-1 inhibitor increased collateral flow in SHR,
leading us to hypothesize that treatment to dilate LMAs during occlusion will improve collateral flow and extend
the time window for reperfusion in SHR. Therefore Aim 2 is to determine the efficacy of induced hypertension
and vasodilation as collateral therapeutics on outcome from LVO. We will use the mechanistic information gained
under Aim 1 to guide Aim 2 and test clinically relevant treatments on penumbral perfusion, oxygenation and long-
term outcome from LVO. The results of this project will provide valuable information on the function of pial
collaterals that are central to stroke treatment and outcome from LVO."
10814359,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Brief resolved unexplained events (BRUE) are frightening episodes characterized by appearance of
life-threatening choking, cyanosis, and limpness in infants. These common events are resource-intensive and
current management inadequately addresses persistent symptoms. Infants with BRUE commonly have
oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration, which is a modifiable risk factor for persistent symptoms, but there
are no studies determining the mechanism behind this swallow dysfunction and if swallow interventions reduce
morbidity. Systematic investigation of the contribution of oropharyngeal dysphagia to disease burden in this
population is urgently needed, as this approach has vast potential to optimize clinical outcomes, improve
quality of life and reduce healthcare utilization. Daniel Duncan, MD MPH is an Instructor at Harvard Medical
School (HMS) and a subspecialist within the Aerodigestive Center at Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH). He has
gained substantial clinical research experience during his medical training and has demonstrated commitment
to an academic career in patient oriented research. His career goal is to direct a clinical research program
focused on identifying evidenced-based, state of the art interventions for oropharyngeal dysphagia and
aerodigestive disorders that transform clinical care for this vulnerable pediatric population.
 This Career Development Award will provide additional mentored training and research opportunities in
high resolution impedance-manometry and decision analysis for Dr. Duncan to advance his quantitative
research skills while addressing the current knowledge gap related to mechanisms of swallow dysfunction in
BRUE. The proposed innovative studies will systematically determine mechanisms by which thickened feeds
modulate swallow function and confirm these findings in a larger cohort, which will allow for derivation of an
improved algorithm for BRUE care. He will study effects of alterations in liquid viscosity on upper esophageal
motility using pharyngeal impedance-manometry, follow a prospective cohort to determine predictors of
response to thickening, and use decision analysis to identify patients that could receive empiric thickening.
 The mentorship and scientific training afforded by this career development award will be critical for Dr.
Duncan’s academic development. His primary mentor, Dr. Rosen, is an aerodigestive expert. His co-mentors,
Drs. Jadcherla and Omari, are experts in neonatal swallow dysfunction and impedance-manometry; all are
outstanding clinical researchers with deep commitment to mentorship. He will be supported by his Scholarship
Advisory Committee consisting of Drs. Snapper, Nurko, Landrigan, and Stamoulis, who lend content-area
expertise. His formal training includes advanced coursework in decision analysis at Harvard School of Public
Health, personal instruction on esophageal motility and decision analysis, and professional development
courses. His training and research activities will be conducted in the unparalleled academic environments of
BCH and HMS, which are firmly committed to Dr. Duncan’s successful transition to independence."
10813217,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from infection globally. Our knowledge of the cellular and
molecular events that link inhalation of the causative bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), with either
clearance or productive infection remains limited. The type I interferon (IFN) response is among the first innate
immune responses triggered in Mtb-infected macrophages. Growing evidence suggests that type I IFNs, and
specifically cross-talk between the type I IFN response and the IL-1 axis, drive pathogenesis in TB. However,
our understanding of the cascade of events that initiate the type I IFN response in Mtb-infected host cells is
incomplete. The literature increasingly supports a model in which mitochondrial damage is a key driver of type I
IFN production in Mtb-infected macrophages. In preliminary work, we have uncovered a set of previously
unappreciated additional cellular pathways that contribute to Mtb-induced type I IFNs, including the ER stress
response (ESR), lipid droplet (LD) formation, and eicosanoid production. In the proposed work, we will build
upon our preliminary results to define molecular relationships between ER stress, LD formation, eicosanoid
production, and mitochondrial damage in type I IFN response to Mtb. We will then use a murine model of
infection to test the impact of modulating the ESR on infection outcomes. In Aim 1, we will use CRISPR
technology to build genetic tools to study the pathways of interest. Using these tools and small molecule
inhibitors, we will then test links between arms of the ESR, LD formation, eicosanoid production, and type I
IFNs. To more completely characterize the role of the ESR and individual response pathways in the
macrophage response to Mtb, we will additionally perform multiplexed cytokine analysis, transcriptional
profiling, and metabolomics using our genetic and small molecule tools that perturb the ESR. In Aim 2, we will
test which of the identified contributors to type I IFNs drive mitochondrial damage. In Aim 3, we will use small
molecule inhibitors in two murine models of TB infection to determine how modulating the ESR in the context
of TB infection changes bacterial burden, immune cell recruitment to the lung compartment, histopathology,
cytokine responses, and the transcriptional response. Upon achieving our aims, we anticipate having
developed a new, more complex model for induction of type I IFNs in Mtb-infected macrophages. Further, we
anticipate having determined how the ESR shapes the macrophage response to Mtb infection and contributes
to infection outcomes in vivo. We anticipate these results will ultimately inform the development of novel host
directed therapies for TB."
10828767,"We and others have shown that the nonapeptide, oxytocin (OT), circumvents leptin resistance to elicit body
weight loss in obese rodents, nonhuman primates and humans, by reducing food intake while increasing energy
expenditure (EE). The identification of recruitable brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans (95) has renewed
interest in drugs that target BAT to elicit weight loss by increasing EE, in conjunction with strategies that reduce
food intake. Oxytocin (OT) is a downstream target of the adiposity signal, leptin, and is an attractive therapeutic
target to treat obesity in humans (46, 105) because it reduces body weight in DIO rodents even in the presence
of “leptin resistance,” which impairs leptin-induced reduction in food intake (60). Aside from eliciting weight loss,
OT also elicits beneficial cardiometabolic effects in genetically obese rodent models (77) and reduces blood
pressure (BP) in normal (74) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (75). Furthermore, chemogenetic activation
of paraventricular nucleus (PVN) OT neurons reduces heart rate (HR) and BP in lean rats and a rat model of
heart failure (24, 34). OT neurons that project directly from the parvocellular PVN to the 1) hindbrain nucleus of
the solitary tract and/or spinal cord and 2) dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (79, 85) are positioned to reduce
food intake and stimulate EE and decrease HR and BP, respectively. These circuits are therefore potential
targets for pharmacological therapies to reverse the elevation in HR and BP associated with diet-induced obesity
(DIO; (88, 99)). We recently found in DIO rats, central (25) or systemic OT (Preliminary Data) administered in
combination with the beta-3 receptor (β-3R) agonist, CL 316243, is a more effective anti-obesity regimen than
either OT or CL 31243 alone. However, we and others have also found CL 316243 and the FDA-approved β-3R
agonist, mirabegron, may also increase HR and BP at doses that elevate EE and/or elicit weight loss
(Preliminary Data). What remains unclear is whether systemic OT could be used as an adjunct to CL 316243
to promote body weight loss while averting deleterious effects on HR and BP. In Specific Aim 1 we will test the
hypothesis that DIO-associated inhibition of PVN OT neurons contributes to the elevated HR and BP associated
with DIO. To test this hypothesis, we will employ a chemogenetic strategy to determine if chronic inhibition of
PVN OT neurons in low fat diet-fed mice mimics the adverse effects of DIO on HR and BP associated with DIO
in male and female DIO Oxytocin-Ires-Cre mice (transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase in OT-
expressing cells; available at JAX ®). We further hypothesize that activation of PVN OT neurons will reverse the
adverse effects of DIO on HR and BP in DIO. To test this hypothesis, we will examine if chronic chemogenetic
excitation of PVN OT neurons attenuates the elevated HR and BP associated with DIO. We anticipate these
studies will identify 1) an important role for PVN OT neuronal inhibition in the adverse effects associated with
DIO and 2) the extent to which increased PVN OT neuronal signaling can reverse these effects. Endpoints will
include HR, BP, food intake, body composition, body weight, and histological (cardiomyocyte cross sectional
area, myocardial lipid content) and genetic (inflammatory) markers of heart health. In Specific Aim 2 we will test
the translational hypothesis that OT 1) reverses the elevations of HR and BP associated with DIO and 2) can be
used as an adjunct to reduce elevations in HR and BP associated with β-3R agonist treatment in male and
female DIO rats. To test these hypotheses, we will determine the effects of chronic systemic OT alone and in
combination with CL 316243 on HR and BP in male and female DIO rats. Endpoints will include HR, BP, food
intake, body composition, body weight, and histological (cardiomyocyte cross sectional area, myocardial lipid
content) and genetic (inflammatory) markers of heart health. Our findings will create a preclinical infrastructure
upon which future studies are undertaken to address whether intranasal OT therapy may reverse these adverse
cardiometabolic effects associated with obesity in humans."
10720903,"According to the United States (US) Census Bureau, the number of veterans in the US in 2018 was around 19.9
million. Nine out of 10 were males, and 33% were between 50-69 years old, an age group that is at the highest
risk for prostate cancer (PCa). The VA Central Cancer Registry consistently shows that PCa is the most
frequently diagnosed cancers among male veterans, accounting for >30% of the approximately 50,000 cancer
diagnoses. There is growing concern that environmental and/or occupational exposure to metal ions during
deployment and post-deployment increases PCa risk in veterans. The International Agency for Cancer Research
classified inorganic arsenic (iAs) as a carcinogen, while lead (Pb) is a potential carcinogen in humans. Pb
exposure is a known hazard of military service, while data for iAs exposure is less well-established. Further,
wide-spread exposure to these metal ions in veterans could be mediated through inhalation, ingestion, and
dermal adsorption of toxic smoke from burning oil fields and waste disposal burn-pits. iAs and/or Pb exposure
have been considered potential risk factors for PCa, but the underlying mechanism is largely undefined. In a
small clinical study, we found that iAs and Pb levels were significantly higher in the urine of PCa patients
compared to controls. Using our new 2-hit animal model, we found that exposure to iAs or Pb increased (1) PCa
risk in vivo and (2) the ability of prostate epithelial stem-like cells (PrESLCs) isolated from treated animals to
form colonies in soft agar, a hallmark of cellular transformation. In this animal model, a 1-month metal treatment
followed by chemical carcinogen treatment significantly increased the incidence of PCa and pre-cancerous
lesions in iAs-treated mice, with similar trends in Pb-treated animals. Importantly, single-cell RNAseq analyses
revealed that Pb was associated with the expansion of a subpopulation of PrESLCs with epithelial lineage
markers into stroma-like oncogenic cells, while iAs was associated with the emergence of a rare, unique
subpopulation of oncogenic PrESLCs similar to “cancer” stem cells. This proposal will test the hypothesis that
iAs and/or Pb dysregulate specific, and likely different, signaling pathways in subpopulations of
PrESLCs to initiate or increase the risk of carcinogenesis in the prostate. This is an untested hypothesis
in the field of prostate carcinogenesis and in military veterans’ health. Two Aims are proposed. Aim 1: Determine
the carcinogenic potential of metal treated PrESLCs in vivo using a renal grafting model of PCa formation. We
will evaluate the effects of metals on the formation of PCa in vivo in immune-deficient host mice, either with or
without chemical induction of PCa. Aim 2: Characterize stem-like cells with metal-specific transcriptomic
signatures. We will use single-cell RNAseq and visualization informatics to identify the unique gene signatures
that characterize rare subpopulations of metal-induced cancer stem cells within the PrESLC population. We aim
to apply these gene signatures to enrich rare subpopulations by FACS and evaluate their carcinogenic potential.
We will also leverage The Cancer Genome Atlas PCa data and other online databases to enable accurate
classification of major, rare, and heterogeneous subtypes of PrESLCs to gain insights into metal carcinogenesis.
Findings from the proposed work may address questions related to occupational and post-deployment exposure
and expand our knowledge of stem cell biology. Successful completion of these studies may lead to the
development of new PCa prevention and therapeutic strategies. Plans to reduce unnecessary exposure to those
metal ions can be justified and implemented as effective strategies for PCa prevention. Drugs targeting specific
subpopulations of stem cells may be used as therapeutic options to prevent early PCa development and slow
progression. When applied to veterans, the results of this study may save lives, improve health, and decrease
disabilities in this community and beyond."
10786068,"Project Summary
 This research plan is aimed at creating an off-the-shelf transcatheter vein valve capable
of regeneration. If successful, it could treat many thousands of patients who suffer from chronic
venous insufficiency in deep veins, untreatable with compression stockings, and the sequelae of
debilitating leg ulcers, as there is currently no FDA-approved prosthetic vein valve. This novel
vein valve is created from a tissue grown from donor dermal fibroblasts directly on a nitinol stent
followed by decellularization. We have shown in a recent publication that the resulting bileaflet
valve meets hydrodynamic performance criteria in vitro and regenerates with host cells,
including endothelialization, without gross calcification, stenosis, or thickening of the leaflets
post-delivery in the ovine iliac vein model based on initial testing.
 We propose here to make a key improvement upon the initial design and results by
using a stent that transitions from a circular section to an oval section, emulating vein valve
sinuses to improve hemodynamics and mitigate leaflet fusion to the valve wall that currently
occurs in vivo over time. In this milestone-driven plan, valve geometries will first be screened
using computational modeling of valve function and then characterized hydrodynamically.
Valves of 12 mm diameter enhanced with these sinuses will be delivered via catheter to the
ovine iliac vein for up to 24-week duration with (R61 phase) and without (R33 phase) sustained
anti-coagulation based on the rate of endothelialization. Delivery will be conducted in the normal
anatomy and in a venous reflux model in sheep achieved by compromising the tricuspid valve
sufficiently to ensure the valves are cycled in these quadrupeds. Longitudinal assessment of
valve function will be made via ultrasound and venogram. Harvested valve leaflets will be
assessed for dimensions, tensile mechanical properties, cellularity and phenotype via
immunohistochemistry, and matrix composition via biochemical assay and histology.
 An INTERACT meeting will also be conducted during the R33 phase to ascertain GMP
manufacturing and GLP testing expectations of the FDA for a transcatheter vein valve,
extending prior FDA interaction regarding the decellularized tissue that we create in vitro to
include stent and valve testing in light of ISO standards that exist for transcatheter heart valves.
Our Office of Technology Commercialization will also be engaged regarding patent protection
beyond the PCT filed and commercialization opportunities."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in the elderly. Most AMD
cases are the nonexudative (or “dry”) form, which affects up to 200 million patients globally and is comprised of
intermediate dry AMD, characterized by formation of sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) deposits called
drusen, and geographic atrophy (GA), more advanced disease characterized by loss of RPE and
photoreceptors. Currently, there are no available treatments for any form of dry AMD. Thus, there is a
tremendous unmet need for any effective therapy. Mitochondrial dysfunction at the RPE has been established
as a major disease mechanism for dry AMD. While systemically administered mitochondria-targeted drugs
have shown promise in preclinical and early-phase clinical studies of dry AMD, they have limitations, including
insufficient bioavailability at the retina in some patients. The purpose of this Direct to Phase 2 SBIR grant
application is to develop a novel intravitreal extended release mitochondria targeted drug (IVT Mito XR) for the
treatment of dry AMD. Eclipse Life Sciences has designed novel mitochondria targeted prodrugs of EY005
(lead and backups). Preliminary studies demonstrate that the lead EY005 prodrug and a pilot formulation of the
prodrug in IVT Mito XR has excellent efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo models of mitochondrial dysfunction
that are relevant to dry AMD. The proposed project is focused on developing lead and backup formulations of
IVT Mito XR using Eclipse’s proprietary extended release drug delivery system (XRDDS), to achieve target
product specification of 3 months’ sustained release of EY005 following a single intravitreal injection. Aim 1 will
finalize IVT Mito XR formulations of lead and backup prodrugs. Aim 2 will be to perform nonGLP (good
laboratory practice) pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and proof of concept efficacy studies of IVT Mito XR in
rabbit models. Aim 3 will be to execute GMP (good manufacturing practice) production and preliminary
characterization of lead EY005 prodrug. The end deliverable will be submission of a pre-IND package in
preparation for scheduling a pre-IND meeting with FDA."

Current common methods for measuring somatosensory function in preclinical rodent models
generally rely on withdrawal responses to uncomfortable or painful stimuli. These tests can be
stressful to the animal, while also yielding a high variability in measured responses, and
repetitive testing in longitudinal models may even result in chronic pain states. To better
understand the connection between physiology and perception of touch and proprioception,
researchers need a modern, off-the-shelf assessment system to administer and quantify trained,
volitional behaviors. Under this Phase II STTR project, Vulintus, Inc. will continue to develop and
validate ‘SensiTrak,’ an automated, high-throughput behavioral system designed to finely
measure somatosensory function in rodent models. SensiTrak meets the needs of
somatosensory-focused researchers by supporting complex, electromechanical feedback
interactions with animals, with interchangeable task modules, behavioral peripherals, and
open-source control software. Vulintus’ Phase II activities included finalization and certification
of a common controller and modules for assessing tactile, vibration, and proprioception
discrimination thresholds. Concurrently, SensiTrak systems will undergo beta testing at two
different laboratories at Columbia University and the Winifred Masterson Burke Medical
Research Institute. Beta testing will help establish the reliability and utility of SensiTrak
assessments and will guide the development of protocols for other laboratories to follow when
adopting SensiTrak in their research. At the conclusion of this Phase II, a fully developed
SensiTrak product line will provide researchers with unprecedented capabilities to reliably
measure tactile and proprioceptive function in early preclinical animal models, and will help to
improve the rate of successful translation of promising therapies from preclinical investigations
to clinical practice."

The goal of PuraCath’s Commercial Readiness Pilot is to prepare for commercialization
of a therapeutic system for disinfection of a needleless connector for Peripherally Inserted
Central Catheters that reduces the risk of intraluminal colonization as a source of
catheter-related bloodstream infections. The system uses ultraviolet light to eliminate
microbes and biofilm derived from fungi and bacteria by 99.99%, a 4-log reduction, to
prevent Catheter Line Associated Bloodstream Infections. We propose to develop a
commercialization-ready Firefly™ UV Disinfection System. This system consists of a
neutral displacement, straight valve, UV-transmissive, needleless connector; and a
handheld device with UV LEDs and sensor technology.
In Phase II, PuraCath Medical developed and validated the Firefly™ UV Disinfection
System performance. The FDA 510(k) submission process was initiated, and an initial
clearance was received for the Firefly Needleless Connector (K203796, cleared July 30,
2021). The Firefly UV Disinfection Handpiece and Charging Station are currently under
review with the FDA with clearance for the initial design pending (K213160, application
filed November 12, 2021).
In this Commercial Readiness Pilot, we will complete the steps needed to support clinical
use and commercialization, with four aims: 1) Establish readiness for commercial
manufacturing, 2) Prepare for clinical trials, 3) Develop a Quality System, integrate
manufacturing partners, and design and prepare training materials and; 4) Develop
software to monitor and ensure proper use and compliance.
These results will enable us to conduct clinical studies that will support our efficacy claims
and provide evidence of the benefit of the system. In parallel, we are seeking Phase IIb
support to conduct the clinical trials. The outcome of this entire SBIR program will be a
body of clinical evidence to drive adoption of the Firefly™ UV Disinfection System by
hospitals. The proposed project will improve scientific knowledge in the UV disinfection
space for colonized surfaces and clinical practices for infection control in hospitals and
outpatient clinics. Additionally, with the help of this NIH CRP grant we will generate data
supporting other UV LED applications for disinfection in hospital settings."
10764911,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe life-threatening complication that can be caused by
viral infection. The disease is characterized by cytokine-driven hyperinflammation and leukocytes count
changes. The innate immune response has been linked to ARDS immunopathogenesis. In this regard,
neutrophils have been highlighted as essential effector cells in the development of ARDS, as demonstrated in
influenza and coronavirus infections. Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting hyperactivated neutrophils
may be useful for mitigating ARDS.
The gut microbiota has emerged as an important regulator of the host immunity. Microbial components from
the gut microbiota can regulate neutrophil functions, modulating the magnitude of inflammatory responses not
only locally, but also systemically. The gut-lung microbiome connection implicates the gut microbiome as a
relevant new strategy to lessen disease severity in viral-mediated ARDS.
The current pandemic has taught us that we need novel, revolutionary therapies that can be deployed quickly
and easily to the general population worldwide. In the context of viral-induced ARDS, targeting neutrophils,
restoring airways epithelial cell barrier, and refocusing the immune response represents a critical and novel
strategy that is neither limited by our understanding of the viral pathogens` biology nor by antigenicity or
mutational status but can act broadly by leveraging the existing host immune repertoire.
Rise Therapeutics is developing R-3750, a functionally directed synthetic probiotic that engages natural
microbiome-associated immunological processes with the potential to diminish lung neutrophilia, reduce
inflammation, upregulate regulatory T cells, and restore airways epithelial barrier to balance and reset patient’s
immunological repertoire. R-3750 is inexpensive to manufacture, is orally dosed, and is stored stably at room
temperature. R-3750, Lactococcus (L.) lactis engineered to express Surface Layer Protein A (SlpA), works via
oral targeted delivery of SlpA to the intestinal tract where it engages mucosal dendritic cells lining the intestinal
tract to reset immunological repertoires to blunt inflammatory processes. R-3750 induces exquisite differential
gene expression leading to upregulation of anti-viral defense mechanisms and down-regulation of pro-
inflammatory pathways. No safety issues for R-3750 have ever been noticed in animal models, and L. lactis is
commonly ingested in our diet, as this strain is used as a probiotic and in the food industry.
This Phase II proposal seeks funding to identify novel biomarkers and further understand R-3750 mechanism
of action in several models of lung injuries, while completing key IND-enabling activities. R-3750 represents a
new revolutionary therapy that combines the safety, economics, and ease of administration of a probiotic with
the targeted delivery of an immunologically relevant protein that can quickly be deployed to save lives of virally
infected patients with a hyperactive immune response."

In mammals, cartilage is predominantly an embryonic tissue: the vast majority of cartilage is replaced by bone
during the processes of hypertrophy and ossification, with cartilage persisting in relatively few places within the
adult skeleton (e.g. in joints, as articular cartilage). Articular cartilage is an aneural, avascular tissue with very
limited capacity for spontaneous repair, hence the prevalence in humans of cartilage pathologies like
osteoarthritis. In contrast, cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates, and rays) have undergone an evolutionary loss
of bone, instead possessing a skeleton that is composed entirely of pre-hypertrophic cartilage, and that
remains cartilaginous throughout life. Understanding how cartilaginous fishes arrest skeletal development prior
to chondrocyte hypertrophy will shed new light on transcriptional features that could be employed for in vitro
engineering of stable chondrocytes for the treatment of human cartilage injuries.
Stem cell-based approaches for the treatment of articular cartilage injuries are currently hindered by the
relative instability of mammalian cartilage cells (chondrocytes) in vitro and upon implantation into an injury site.
In this project, the molecular development of cartilage in the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea) will be studied to
discover gene expression correlates of their permanent cartilaginous skeleton. This project will begin with the
use of single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify genes that are differentially expressed between
developing and differentiated skate and mammalian chondrocytes (Aim 1), and that may underlie arrest
prior to hypertrophy in the former. ATAC-seq and comparative genomic approaches will then be used to
test for variation in non-coding regions (i.e. putative enhancers) that might account for divergent gene
expression during skate and mammalian skeletogeneis (Aim 2). Finally, skate-inspired molecular
manipulations (CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and/or transgenesis) will be incorporated in an in vitro
model of mammalian skeletogenesis, in order to achieve a permanent and stable chondrocyte cell state
from mammalian mesenchymal progenitors (Aim 3).
This project will capitalize on the unique properties of the skate skeleton, and on the biological resources,
facilities, and expertise that are available at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. By taking an
evolution-inspired tissue engineering approach, this project will contribute to the development of novel in vitro
techniques for cartilage engineering and for the treatment of mammalian skeletal pathologies."
10732223,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Binge eating, characterized by eating a large amount of food in a short period of time accompanied by
a sense of loss of control over eating, is a public health crisis. Negative affect is a well-established antecedent
for binge eating. The affect regulation model of binge eating posits that elevated negative affect increases
momentary risk for binge eating, as engaging in binge eating alleviates negative affect and reinforces the
behavior. The field’s existing capacity to identify moments of elevated negative affect, and thus risk for binge
eating, has largely relied on ecological momentary assessment (EMA). EMA involves the completion of
surveys in real time on one’s smartphone to report behavioral, cognitive, and emotional symptoms throughout
the day. Although EMA provides ecologically valid information about daily experiences, EMA surveys are often
delivered only 5-6 times per day, involve self-report of affect intensity, and are unable to assess physiological
arousal that accompanies affect. Wearable, psychophysiological sensors that measure markers of affect
arousal including heart rate, heart rate variability, and electrodermal activity, may augment EMA surveys to
improve our capacity to accurately detect risk for binge eating in real time. These sensors can objectively,
continuous, and passively measure biomarkers of nervous system arousal that coincide with affect, thus
allowing them to measure affective trajectories on a continuous timescale, detect changes in negative affect
before the individual is consciously aware of them, and reduce user burden to improve data completeness.
Despite their potential to improve the field’s capacity to detect risk for binge eating, the feasibility and
acceptability of these sensors among individuals with binge eating has not yet been established. Additionally, it
is unknown whether features extracted from these sensors can adequately distinguish between positive and
negative affect states, given that physiological arousal may occur during both negative and positive affect
states. The aims of the present study are: 1) test the hypothesis that sensor features will distinguish positive
and negative affect states in individuals with binge eating with > 60% accuracy; 2) test the hypothesis that a
machine learning algorithm using sensor data and EMA-reported negative affect data to predict the occurrence
of binge eating episodes will predict binge eating with greater accuracy than an algorithm using EMA-reported
negative affect alone; 3) use a mixed methods approach to evaluate acceptability and feasibility of wearable
sensors among individuals with binge eating. To do so, the present study will recruit 30 individuals with
clinically-significant binge eating who will wear Empatica E4 wristbands to passively measure heart rate and
electrodermal activity and report affect and binge eating on EMA surveys for four weeks. Participants with
binge eating (N = 30) and community eating disorder clinicians (N = 10) will also complete self-report
measures and focus groups to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and user preferences regarding the use of
sensors to power improved momentary interventions for binge eating."

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ubiquitous in the brain and underlie regulation of attention and arousal by
cholinergic neurons. nAChRs are highly expressed in neurons of the reinforcement and reward pathways, and
maladaptive effects on nAChRs resulting from drug exposure contribute to drug addiction. These receptors are
crucial in addiction both to nicotine (a direct orthosteric agonist of nAChRs) and to other drugs of abuse
resulting from drug induced plastic changes in cholinergic activity in reward centers. A persistent challenge
facing any nAChR-targeted pharmaceutical approach against addiction is the broad diversity in assembly and
distribution of the brain-expressed forms of the protein. The long-term goal of this project is to develop an
accurate and comprehensive methodology to identify and therapeutically target the full family of native nAChR
conformations. The short-term goal of this R03 proposal is to demonstrate that a yeast-display nanobody
library, screened against two distinct, widely expressed and physiologically critical conformations of nAChRs,
will demonstrate the ability to robustly parse two separate stoichiometries of the nAChR in in vitro fluorescence
and electrophysiology assays. The rationale is to deliver proof-of-concept that this approach can specifically
target individual receptor types, to stimulate further characterization of successfully identified reagents for their
possible functionality in modifying nAChR activity, and ultimately to establish the approach as a feasible
method to study the native expression and assembly properties of the entire family of native nAChRs. This
study includes two related objectives: 1) to develop a nanobody library enriched for yeast-mounted variable
domain modules that potently bind purified 42 nAChRs and 2) to establish an effective counter-screening
assay to deplete stoichiometrically non-specific nanobodies to purify interactors that selectively target two
physiologically relevant, structurally distinct assemblies of 42. This represents an innovative application of
the cutting-edge yeast nanobody screening method against a persistent roadblock in understanding the
maladaptive changes to nicotinic receptor protein expression and distribution. Development and delivery of a
biologic toolbox to study and manipulate all native nAChRs in vivo, as is the overall goal of this research, would
represent a significant biomedical advance to investigate and combat addiction and other human ailments
associated with the cholinergic nervous system."

This proposal responds to RFA-MH-22-135. Non-disclosure of suicide ideation prior to attempt is normative
and even more common in later life. Similarly, our preliminary data indicates lower inclusion of social contacts
in suicide safety plans among at-risk older adults. Unfortunately, interventions to increase informal help
seeking are ineffective to date. Therefore, major roadblocks exist in the interpersonal processes seen as
essential to late-life suicide prevention, and new targets are needed for increasing help-seeking behavior. The
purpose of this longitudinal observational project is to understand why older adults do not disclose suicide
ideation or seek help from others amidst suicide crises. We focus on social cognitive abilities and biases,
which influence how individuals perceive (or misperceive) others and have previously been associated with
loneliness, suicidal ideation and behavior. The premise of this research is that social cognitive impairments
impact the positive and negative valence systems involved in affiliation and the social structures that determine
help seeking in suicide. Facilitating this research, our group has developed and validated a dyadic social
affiliation task that objectively quantifies RDoC positive and negative valence systems involved in support
seeking. This task enables evaluation of valence systems across multiple units of analysis, including behavior,
self-report, facial affect and natural language processing. Measurement of these intrinsic processes will be
integrated with quantification of extrinsic help-seeking opportunity, via structural social network assessment. A
translational aspect of our proposed social network analyses is to augment network measurement with the
social elements of suicide safety planning. In a longitudinal study, we will recruit a sample of diverse older
adults from a variety of urgent, primary, and mental health care settings. Recruitment will be stratified by
groups defined by current active suicide ideation, depressive symptoms without ideation or attempt histories,
and healthy comparators. In Aim 1 of the study, we will compare groups on social cognition, positive and
negative valence indicators from our social affiliation task, along with social network structure, including past
help seeking and disclosure in the subgroup with current suicide ideation. In Aim 2, we will administer mobile
emotion recognition tasks and social affiliation in predicting in real-time suicide disclosure through ecological
momentary assessment over 30 days. We will then evaluate whether social cognition and affiliation markers
predict trajectories of help seeking and suicide ideation through longitudinal data gathered over one year.
Exploratory analyses will leverage the data derived by applying time series network analyses and natural
language processing to model processes underlying non-disclosure. Our long-term goal is to translate this
research to novel personalized interventions that improve interpersonal processes embedded in both current
and novel suicide prevention approaches for older adults. This proposal responds directly to NIMH Strategic
Plan, Aim 2.2 and 3.2, and the NIMH’s Priority Area in Digital Mental Health."

as having more than one centromere. In normal cells, radials are quite rare, and they almost never form
spontaneously. Radials have an important clinical relevance, however, since their appearance is a diagnostic
hallmark of the bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition and premature aging syndrome, Fanconi anemia
(FA). Interestingly though, even in FA cells, radial chromosomes do not appear spontaneously with high
frequency but usually need to be induced by exposure to clinically-relevant DNA crosslinking reagents, such as
mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin. Despite their diagnostic use for many decades, radial formation is still poorly
understood, and the literature is filled with conflicting reports about what is required mechanistically for their
production. In our first Specific Aim, we describe the construction of a human cell line that is defective for the
radiation sensitive 18 (RAD18) gene. RAD18 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase and is required for translesion
synthesis (TLS), an error-prone DNA damage tolerance pathway, which is a subpathway in the FA-mediated
DNA crosslink repair process. Consistent with this role, RAD18-null human cells generated high levels of MMC-
induced radials. Unexpectedly, the absence of DNA ligase III (LIGIII) and DNA polymerase theta (POLQ; both
key components of alternative non-homologous end joining; A-EJ)) dramatically reduced RAD18-dependent,
MMC-induced radial formation. Thus, the radials generated by the absence of RAD18 appear to require the A-
EJ pathway. We propose to confirm these observations and extend the generality of these studies by
determining the requirement for A-EJ in MMC-induced radial formation in Bloom syndrome (BLM) (another
cancer predisposition and premature aging syndrome) and FA-defective cells.
 Amazingly, there is not a single report in the literature regarding the molecular makeup of a radial
chromosome fusion junction. This is unfortunate, since an analysis of fusion junctions for a wide variety of other
types of translocations (e.g., canonical reciprocal chromosomal translocations and telomere fusions) has provide
a wealth of data regarding the molecular signatures of such junctions as well as insight into the repair
mechanisms responsible for their formation. In our Specific Aim 2, we propose to rectify this egregious omission.
Specifically, we describe a protocol (Radial-Seq) for isolating, sequencing and bioinformatically analyzing radial
chromosome fusions. We expect this analysis to confirm the formation of such junctions by A-EJ and to greatly
extend our understanding of the molecular makeup of a radial fusion. In toto, these experiments should
mechanistically define the requirements for radial formation which should benefit basic researchers; in addition,
the assignment of A-EJ for their formation may help clinicians therapeutically hinder their formation."

Peter Chiarelli, MD DPhil, is a clinician-scientist in the field of pediatric neurosurgery, who is focused on the
application of photochemical techniques to treat disease of the human brain. This K08 mentored career
development award will provide the advanced training and mentorship within the fields of biological sciences,
including design and refinement of tumor models, application/evaluation of biological assays, and practical use
of advanced microscopy for biological systems. Supplementing this critical training gap will provide the
resources for success as an independent investigator in the translational application of novel technologies
grounded in the realm of physical chemistry. RESEARCH CONTEXT: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is
a tumor of the brainstem that occurs in children, with no available option for safe surgical resection, and no
effective current chemotherapeutic strategy. The development of alternative therapies for this incurable brain
cancer is a priority among pediatric neuro-oncology consortia. A new approach for the treatment of DIPG is
proposed, grounded on successful pre-clinical work with a different high-grade brain tumor (murine xenograft
model of supratentorial glioblastoma). This method takes advantage of the radiation which is already
necessary for children with DIPG, and uses targeted ~35 nm biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)-coated
iron oxide core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) to modify the effects of incident radiation by inducing Auger
photoelectron ejection from the nanoparticle core. Through the biochemical targeting of NPs to the tumor cells,
the effect of radiation is spatially enhanced within sub-micron distances from the NP, allowing the possibility of
lower overall radiation doses to be delivered with greater tumor cytotoxicity. This research project will use a
reliable murine model of DIPG, and apply targeted iron oxide-PEG NPs through two different methods:
intravenous (IV) delivery, and convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to the brain. A mechanistic exploration of
the NP-Auger effect will also be carried out using 2-dimensional thin films, to better understand the spatial
extent over which photoelectron ejection exerts a biological effect. The goal of developing this technology is
the translation to human pediatric clinical trials for DIPG, and to achieve the first substantial improvement in
outcome observed over the past 3+ decades. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Chiarelli will complete
coursework on the advanced tumor biology in animal models, methods in benchtop molecular biology, and
quantitative imaging (cell culture and tissue). This coursework will be integrated with the sequence of specific
aims included in this proposal, so that training can be directly applied to the research. An interdisciplinary team
of mentors with expertise spanning clinical neuro-oncology, live-cell imaging, DIPG biology, biomaterials
design, and physical chemistry of 2-D surfaces has been assembled to provide close mentorship for Dr.
Chiarelli, and the guidance necessary for clinical translation of the included work, presentation at professional
meetings, as well as progress towards independent funding (R01 submission)."
10769807,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
South Africa’s rapidly growing population of older adults living with HIV (OPLHV) have suboptimal HIV-related outcomes, as they face a concomitant rise in levels of disability and chronic disease on top of a lack of HIV care and treatment interventions explicitly targeting older populations. With few alternatives to family-based care, most older Africans age in place, but with the “hollowed out” middle generation and high rates of labor migration, there is need to look elsewhere to seek the multi-dimensional support needed to age healthily. The proposed project aims to explore how an innovative intergenerational intervention could improve approaches to the management of HIV and related co-morbidities among OPLHV while offering opportunity to the younger generation in South Africa, where youth unemployment is a national concern, by employing youth to assist OPLHV in their communities. To shape early intervention development, the proposed formative and sequential mixed methods study aims to: 1) Identify the determinants of social support associated with aging healthy with HIV by gender and across the later life course—including ART management, management of multimorbidities, and life satisfaction—and how that support is moderated by household structure and composition, through longitudinal analysis of existing quantitative data from the NIH-funded study, Health and Aging in Africa: Longitudinal Studies of an INDEPTH Community; and 2) Elucidate how social support gaps can be strategically filled intergenerationally and inform a feasible intervention. This aim will be met using qualitative data with key intervention stakeholders, including a) in-depth interviews with older adults and their household member(s); b) semi-structured interviews with key informants from the community; and c) focus group discussions with youth. This project responds to the need to prepare for the growing population of adults aging with HIV and related co-morbidities while increasing the evidence base to support the design of interventions for OPLHV in diverse settings and subpopulations."
10881683,"This proposal explores the role of a pulmonary osteoclast-like cell (POLC) in asbestos-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
We first discovered POLCs while studying pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PAM), a rare, autosomal recessive
disorder caused by mutations in the epithelial sodium phosphate co-transporter, Npt2b. Phosphate accumulates
in the alveolar lining fluid and complexes with calcium to form spherical hydroxyapatite microliths containing bone
matrix proteins and surfactant components. Contact of microliths with alveolar macrophages (AM) and recruited
alveolar monocytes (Alv-Mo) induces osteoclastic transformation, with expression of the full repertoire of
osteoclast signature genes and proteins in multinucleated giant cells (MNGC) including tartrate resistant acid
phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CTSK), and the proton pump ATP6V0D2. Single cell RNA sequencing of
human PAM lung also confirmed a robust osteoclast signature in AM, and IHC confirmed the presence of TRAP
and CTSK positive MNGC. Like humans, Npt2b-/- animals develop modest pulmonary fibrosis and a marked
restrictive physiologic defect. We found that microliths induce alveolar expression of the requisite
osteoclastogenic cytokines, mCSF and RANKL, for POLC differentiation and expression of hydrochloric acid and
CTSK that both dissolve stones and damage tissues. We also found that when microliths were adoptively
transferred into the lungs of WT animals, they attached to or were degraded by macrophages, and were cleared
within 28d without residual inflammation or fibrosis or evidence of lung injury. We noted that hyperdense infiltrates
in our index PAM patient progressed rapidly when she was placed on bisphosphonates, and that anti-RANKL
therapy slowed the clearance of microliths in Npt2b-/- mice. These data led us to the conclusion that osteoclastic
transformation of AM and Alv-Mo is the lung's primary defense against microliths and that it may represent a
stereotypic response to other particles, including asbestos. Indeed, we find that asbestos challenge is also
associated with TRAP and CTSK expression in myeloid cells and MNGC in the BAL and lung tissue, and that it
culminates in destructive remodeling and pulmonary fibrosis. The BAL cells from asbestos but not saline treated
mice degrade bone and liberate collagen fragments from the bone matrix when plated on bovine bone slices, the
signature function of osteoclasts. The differential tissue responses of complete healing vs. fibrosis to dissolvable
(microliths) vs. persistent (asbestos) particulates forms the basis for our hypothesis that acid and matrix degrading
enzymes produced by POLCs may be primary drivers of fibrosis when the inhaled particle is invincible. To test
this hypothesis in three aims, we will determine; 1) the gene programs that underlie pulmonary osteoclastic
specification of recruited monocytes in response to asbestos, 2) the osteoclast functions acquired by monocytes
and macrophages upon asbestos challenge, 3) the role of POLCs in the pathogenesis of asbestos-induced
pulmonary fibrosis. This proposal directly addresses mechanisms relevant to progressive pulmonary fibrosis that
still occurs in the thousands of veterans exposed to asbestos in all branches of the military from the 1930s through
the Vietnam, Gulf and Afghanistan Wars, and seeks to develop preclinical evidence supporting anti-osteoclastic
strategies such as bisphosphonates of Denosumab for the treatment of asbestosis."

 Helicobacter pylori is a highly prevalent pathogen, with 50% of the world’s population infected. All H.
pylori infections at minimum cause gastric inflammation. A fraction of those infected will eventually develop
gastric or duodenal ulcer disease, atrophy, or gastric adenocarcinoma or MALT lymphoma. Gastric cancer is
one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide, and eradication of the infection leads to prevention or
even regression of gastric cancer. Treatment is becoming more difficult because of widespread antibiotic
resistance. It is not definitively known who will go on to develop advanced disease, although many different
bacterial and host factors have been implicated. The focus of this research proposal is to study mechanisms
related to novel host/bacterial connections that potentially lead to gastric injury. H. pylori is known to cause
epithelial injury, and preliminary data suggest that the bacteria induce downregulation of the Na,K-ATPase,
which is involved with critical transport functions via establishment of an inward sodium gradient and with cell
adhsion. Decreased Na,K-ATPase activity in gastric epithelial cells leads to reduced barrier function and
gastric injury. Downregulation of the transporter by H. pylori targets newly formed pumps and trafficking from
the ER. The mechanism will be further investigated by studying post-translational modifications potentially
induced by the bacteria, by looking at the physiologic consequences of decreased pump expression on gastric
cells, and by further characterizing the mechanism of pump degradation. H. pylori bacterial factors also play an
important role in induction of gastric injury. From the bacterial standpoint, the role of direct H. pylori adhesion in
Na,K-ATPase downregulation will be delineated. Dependence on the virulance factor CagA and the CagPAI
type 4 secretion system (T4SS) will be determined. The role of gastric injury via Na,K-ATPase downregulation
in induction of signaling pathways from stomal cells will be studied in an enteroid-stromal co-culture model. A
NanoString platform will be used to examine gene changes in bacteria and host simultaneously in order to
expand the targets studied in barrier dysruption and ultimately initiation of oncogenesis. Coordinated signaling
systems induced by bacteria and host that impact decrease in Na,K-ATPase will be delineated, specifically as
related to the CagPAI T4SS; known pathways will be explored and novel pathways will be identified via
innovative mass spectometry techniques. Completion of this work will help determine why and how H. pylori
specifically targets the Na,K-ATPase, identify effector molecules aside from CagA that enter cells via CagPAI
to affect Na,K-ATPase levels, and delineate how bacterial factors modified by host proteins induce signaling
cascades, leading to the changes in transporter levels. The goal of this work is to gain new insight into the
mechanism of gastric injury by H. pylori, which will lead to novel therapeutic protective and treatment options."

 Adenomyosis is a nonmalignant uterine disease characterized by endometrial stroma and glands found
within the myometrium. Adenomyosis has been associated with heavy and painful menstrual periods, pelvic
pain, pain with intercourse, and reproductive dysfunction. However, now that imaging is identifying
adenomyosis in younger and more varied women than those electing hysterectomy where pathological
diagnosis occurred, many of our assumptions about the clinical disease are changing. Additionally, the only
widely accepted and effective treatments for adenomyosis, hysterectomy and hormonal suppression, are
unacceptable for this wider group of women. Much of our uncertainty on diagnosis and treatment for
adenomyosis stem from our uncertainty on its' pathogenesis. The most common theory of adenomyosis
development centers on the involvement of tissue injury and repair mechanisms with resulting adenomyosis
development from invagination of the endometrial basalis into the myometrium (the invasion/invagination
theory). While emerging data support a role for this theory and the involvement of cell migration, proliferation
and invasion in adenomyosis development, a detailed understanding on the mediators and mechanisms is
clearly lacking. To fill this critical gap in our knowledge we will perform a series of experiments which integrate
well-defined human specimens, novel mouse models and rigorous in vitro approaches to identify key
components of a REST-miRNA-tissue remodeling cascade and demonstrate the functionality of this pathway in
the pathogenesis of adenomyosis. The specific hypothesis to be tested in this application is that reduced
expression of endometrial and/or myometrial REST induces alterations in a miRNA-mediated tissue
remodeling cascade which augments adenomyosis development. To test this hypothesis, we will delineate
expression of a novel REST-miRNA mediated tissue remodeling pathway in adenomyosis and define REST's
function using novel experimental mouse models. Using in vitro models for cell proliferation, migration and
invasion, we will decipher cell to cell communication between myometrial-endometrial REST-miRNA tissue
remodeling pathway signaling relevant to adenomyosis pathophysiology. Together, these experiments will
provide novel insight into the role of REST in adenomyosis development and in turn, may lead to identification
of novel treatment targets for this disease."
10758965,"Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that causes life-threatening opportunistic infection
in HIV/AIDS patients. The replicative stage (tachyzoite) develops into a latent stage (bradyzoite)
that is impervious to immunity and approved antiparasitic drugs. Tissue cysts give rise to
recurrent reactivation of infection in the immunocompromised, creating chronic disease in
HIV/AIDS patients. Compounding this problem is a paucity of safe and effective therapies,
which underscores the urgent need to identify essential processes in the parasite that could be
exploited for the development of better drugs. We and others recently discovered that
methylation of adenosines at position 6 (m6A) is abundant in Toxoplasma mRNA, representing
a new layer of gene regulation called epitranscriptomics. Importantly, the proteins that “write”
and “read” m6A modifications are essential for parasite viability. Moreover, as this machinery
resembles plants more than humans, it represents an attractive new drug target. To study this
vulnerability in Toxoplasma, we aim to fill the gap in our knowledge regarding how this signal
dictates the fate of mRNA transcripts through the study of m6A reader proteins. We hypothesize
that Toxoplasma m6A mRNA reader proteins coordinate different aspects of mRNA metabolism
essential for parasite viability. In other species, m6A readers are found in the nucleus and
cytosol, regulating the fate of mRNA by modulating splicing, trafficking, and translation. To date,
only two nuclear YTH family m6A readers have been identified and they remain largely
uncharacterized. And, despite the abundance of m6A mRNA in the cytosol, no cytosolic m6A
readers have been identified. We propose two specific aims that will address our hypothesis by
answering these questions. Aim 1 will determine the roles of the two plant-like YTH m6A
readers operating in the Toxoplasma nucleus. Aim 2 will identify novel m6A reader proteins from
tachyzoites and bradyzoites using a functional m6A-binding probe that we developed. These
pioneering studies will mark the first detailed analysis of m6A readers in both replicative and
latent stages of Toxoplasma, which promises to reveal new therapeutic options to treat this
opportunistic infection of HIV/AIDS patients."
10820486,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Of all neurological diseases, the neuroinflammatory diseases are the most challenging. Many of these remain undiagnosed and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Several studies have shown that nearly a third of the patients on the neurology service at any tertiary care facility have undiagnosed neuroimmune diseases, many of whom have prolonged hospitalizations over several months and nearly a third of these patients die from the illness during this admission. These patients often undergo extensive investigations and multiple empirical therapies with poor results. They also bounce between physicians and major medical centers undergoing repeated investigations with no additional benefit. It is critically necessary that we develop a structured program to diagnose these patients, properly classify these disorders and develop a rational approach to treatment.  Comprehensively investigating individual patients cannot only clarify their underlying diagnosis and lead to more directed therapies, but it can also fundamentally alter how we treat a neuroinflammatory disease more generally. For example, we discovered elevated PD-1 levels on lymphocytes in CSF of patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy which led to the development of a novel treatment for this otherwise fatal illness. Despite these efforts by individual laboratories, many cases still remain undiagnosed and untreated.  This intramural and extramural highly collaborative proposal brings together for the first time physician-scientists and scientists across top academic and government institutions who have dedicated their careers to developing deep clinical phenotyping protocols for patients with idiopathic neuroinflammatory diseases as well as high-throughput and comprehensive tools for identifying microbial nucleic acid in the central nervous system, viral and autoantibody antibody profiling in the cerebrospinal fluid, immune cell profiling and T-cell antigen profiling. These investigations will not only lead to the identification of novel diseases in individual patients but also serve as a model for how neuroinflammatory diseases can be deciphered more widely."

10817117,"ABSTRACT
The 2017 publication of a landmark New England Journal of Medicine study linking clonal hematopoiesis of
indeterminate potential (CHIP) to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) ushered in a new paradigm
in vascular aging research. This work highlighted age-related somatic DNA mutation as an important
contributor to cardiovascular health, with CHIP thought to promote ASCVD primarily through inflammatory
sequelae. Despite the pro-inflammatory setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD), CHIP has not been assessed
for its contribution to end stage kidney disease and premature ASCVD among these patients. Hence, our
long-term objective is to characterize the role of CHIP and its related mechanisms in incident CKD
progression and ASCVD in a CKD setting. To achieve this overall objective, we will leverage the rich
resources of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study, utilizing available whole exome sequencing
(WES) data for baseline CHIP measurement, longitudinally ascertained biospecimens, clinical information, and
molecular biomarkers, along with CKD progression and ASCVD events collected over 16 years of follow-up
study. We propose a discovery stage cohort of 2,126 CRIC participants who were 65 years of age or older at
baseline. Older adults are selected to maximize study efficiency, since CHIP is rare in younger adults. CHIP
status will be determined using baseline WES data and our state-of-the-art analytic pipeline for CHIP somatic
variant calling. We also propose repeated CHIP measurements at 3- and 6-years follow-up in the entire older
adult sub-cohort, along with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in 400 CRIC participants, half with CHIP. We will test
CHIP associations with incident CKD progression (Aim 1) and ASCVD (Aim 2) among the 2,126 CRIC CKD
patients. We will then evaluate upstream (Aim 3a) and downstream (Aim 3b) CHIP mechanisms in the unique
CKD setting using longitudinal information on CHIP and known risk factors for CKD progression and ASCVD,
including: clinical variables (blood pressure, glycemic traits, and lipids), biomarkers of kidney injury, cardiac
stress and injury, inflammation, and fibrosis, use of renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors, and aging
related genetic factors (CDKN2A variants). To discover novel molecular mechanisms, our RNA-seq study will
test associations between CHIP and gene expression (Aim 4a). Differentially expressed genes will be
evaluated for association with CHIP mechanisms identified in Aims 3a and 3b (Aim 4b). To replicate findings,
we will leverage existing CHIP, clinical, biomarker, gene expression and outcome data in up to 4,126 Trans-
omics for Precision Medicine program and 8,520 UK Biobank participants. CHIP effects will be precisely
estimated in powerful meta-analyses of discovery and replication studies. Findings of the proposed research
could have broad implications, ranging from the improvement of risk stratification efforts to the development of
personalized strategies and novel molecular-based therapies for ESKD and ASCVD prevention in CKD."
10828822,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The gut microbiome changes as humans age and affects many aspects of human health including response to
cancer treatments. Increased abundance of the microbe Akkermansia muciniphila has been shown to increase
response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), a class of anti-cancer agents enable the immune system to
identify and attack cancer cells. Rational manipulation of the microbiome is a promising approach to improve
cancer and other health outcomes, but as with many studies and trials, the effect of age is understudied. Older
adults remain poorly represented in clinical trials for ICB and interventions directed at the microbiome to
promote response to ICB. This is problematic because age has been shown to affect the microbiome.
Therefore, an intervention related to the microbiome will likely have to be tailored to older adults. In addition,
diet-based microbiome interventions are likely to enter clinical practice, but linking food intake to changes in
particular microbes has proven challenging.
 My overall goal is to be an academic researcher studying the role of the microbiome in cancer care for
older adults, and how to use diet-based interventions to modify the microbiomes of older adults to promote
health. To this end, the objectives of this application are (1) identify the microbiomes of older adults who
respond to ICB, (2) modify the microbiome through diet-based interventions, and (3) verify the causal role of
the microbiome using preclinical models. To meet these objectives, this study will utilize data from ongoing
trials for which I am leading the microbiome collection, data generation and analysis efforts. First, these data
will help to define the microbiomes of older lung cancer patients who respond to ICB (SA1). Next, we will test a
black raspberry dietary intervention for its ability to promote a pro-ICB response microbiome in older adults
(SA2). Finally, pre- and post-intervention human microbiomes will be transferred into mice to assess the effect
on response to ICBs (SA3).
 These aims will support a method for predicting which older adults will respond to treatment, suggest a
therapeutic strategy to increase healthspan, and improve our understanding of how the microbiome interacts
with the immune system in older adults. This award will provide me with the time to gather knowledge and
experience in fields outside my current training, especially clinical geriatrics and the cancer microbiome. My
mentorship team includes experts in these fields as well as in nutrition, oncology, and computational modeling.
With the dedicated support of these experts and targeted didactics, I believe this award would accelerate my
transition to an independent investigator."
10881723,"Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and a significant burden for Veterans and the VHA
due to the high frequency of recurrence and progression linked to smoking and exposure to deployment-related
carcinogens. Less than 45% of patients with Stage IV bladder cancer survive more than a year in the VA
suggesting the aggressive nature of metastatic urothelial tumors identified among Veterans. The primary cause
of death from bladder cancer is resistance to therapy as these invasive carcinomas acquire cellular plasticity and
stem cell-like properties from long-term changes in epigenetic regulators. In our first VA Merit Award, we first
genomically validated a carcinogen-induced bladder cancer model that replicated smoking induced bladder
cancer and shared the somatic alterations found in locally advanced bladder cancers. To re-establish an
epigenetic balance, we then identified a significant decrease in carcinogen-induced bladder cancers in mice
treated with an enzymatic EZH2-inhibitor. While bladder tumors decreased in size after treatment, we found a
significant increase in the CD3+ T cell immune infiltrate associated with tumor regression. These results were
rapidly translated into an NCI-sponsored clinical trial for patients with metastatic bladder cancer (ETCTN#10183).
In this Phase I/II clinical trial, we are currently treating patients with an EZH2-inhibitor (tazemetostat) and a PD1
inhibitor (pembrolizumab). The PI of this application is the co-PI of the trial and despite clinical response there
remains much to be investigated about the immunotherapy in bladder cancer and how a histone modifying
complex (polycomb repressor complex 2, and EZH2) is involved in immune evasion. The long-term goal of our
research is to investigate the molecular and epigenetic pathways associated with immune evasion of bladder
cancer. By understanding these mechanisms, we may develop rational and novel therapeutics for Veterans with
bladder cancer that combine precision targets and immunotherapy. Given this preliminary data, our central
hypothesis is that EZH2 drives immune evasion by three distinct mechanisms that will be focus of this VA Merit
proposal. In Aim 1 we will determine how EZH2 regulates antigen presentation by MHCI and MHCII to evade
immune detection. In Aim 2, we evaluate how inhibition of EZH2 leads to recruitment of T cells to tumor
microenvironment and in Aim 3 will focus on the action of EZH2 in Tregulatory cells that suppress an immune
response. Through a multi-disciplinary collaboration we have demonstrated feasibility with our approach with
rapid translation from bench to bedside. Successful completion of the studies described in this proposal will
provide an innovative approach to both investigate the mechanisms involved in the evasion of the immune
system of bladder cancer and potentially identify a novel therapeutic approach to treat bladder cancer."
10817179,"Summary
The long term goal of this project is to understand how members of large transcription factor
families, which share a DNA binding domain and typically have very similar DNA binding
specificities, execute highly specific functions in vivo. The primary focus of this proposal is on
the Hox family of homeodomain transcription factors, which play critical roles during animal
embryogenesis, organ development, and appendage specification in both vertebrates and
invertebrates. When these transcription factors mis-regulate their target genes, either due to
mutations in their protein-coding sequences or in their target DNA binding sites, developmental
defects and many human diseases, from cancer to diabetes, can result. For the next funding
period this project will bridge the gap between understanding how these factors specifically
recognize their binding sites in vitro, often in conjunction with cofactors, and how they execute
their specific functions in vivo. This will be accomplished using whole genome approaches with
tagged and mutant Hox factors and by visualizing these proteins and their binding sites in living
cells. Additional efforts will be to identify and characterize newly discovered novel cofactors and
mechanisms, such as post-translational modifications of Hox proteins, that can alter their DNA
binding specificities and/or transcriptional regulatory activities in vivo. In all cases, these
experiments will be grounded in identifying and understanding how Hox proteins regulate their
bona fide target genes, which allow them to orchestrate entire developmental programs, such
as the development of legs and wings."

research engages a broad range of integrated and translational science to investigate specific pathologies
associated with schizophrenia and related disorders including; neurophysiology, neuroimaging, basic
neurochemistry, circuitry modeling in rodents and miniature pigs, disease etiology, domains of
psychopathology and endophenotypes, neurocognition, experimental therapeutics and clinical trials. The
MPRC’s collaborative framework has supported NIMH P50 awards for over 30 years, most recently a CIDAR
and presently in year 6 of a Silvio O. Conte Centerr (Fall 2019). The MPRC is characterized by continuous
interaction and collaboration among preclinical and clinical investigators- we share the same space, seminar
schedules, faculty meetings and general research interests. This integrated experience prepared several
faculty at MPRC to take an active role in supporting NIMH workshops developing behavioral constructs for the
RDoC initiative and one PI on this application is a senior advisor to NIMH assigned to the RDoC Unit. Scientific
opportunities and collaborations are enriched with extensive involvement with other components of the
University of Maryland School of Medicine and School of Pharmacy and the nearby University of Maryland
Baltimore County (UMBC). Postdoctoral training offered under this T32 fellowship has a primary focus on both
basic neuroscience and clinical investigations of schizophrenia and related disorders. All trainees are educated
on the translational perspective of the MPRC and provided mentors and didactic training in both clinical
psychopathology and basic neuroscience as well as structured career planning. We are unique in that we have
a broad array of opportunities for multidisciplinary training (we uniquely accept PharmDs) as well as having
nonresearch focused clinical personnel integrated in the curriculum to training scientists in pragmatic, real
world needs of the field. The culture at the MPRC provides the foundation for our success in recruiting and
training post-doctoral fellows for a scientific career, including clinician scientists. Graduates of the program lead
productive, successful research-intensive careers. This competitive five-year renewal application proposes to
leverage our previous success and continue to improve our training approach (including mentor training) to
produce productive, well-rounded translationally-focused scientists."
10832973,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oligodendrocyte precursor cells continually produce myelinating oligodendrocytes in the adult brain throughout
life. Active myelination of adult brain circuits has been shown to be important for some forms of learning, and
recent work from our groups has shown that this a crucial process in memory storage and retrieval. However,
while previous work has provided essential insight into the regulation of myelin plasticity in the adult brain, it is
not clear how this process impacts the dynamic nature of neural encoding within memory circuits. Myelination
increases conduction velocity across individual axons, however how this translates to computations at the level
of neural circuits and their subsequent behavioral outputs is poorly understood. Thus, a considerable gap
exists between those findings related to axonal myelination in the adult and those that describe the neural
coding dynamics that underlie memory encoding, consolidation and recall. In this proposal we aim to bridge
this gap by 1) elucidating the cell types in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex that become myelinated after a
learning experience, 2) determine how active myelination of cortical circuits impacts the cellular codes that
support memory, 3) how activity-dependent myelination modulates the synchronization and interregional
communication between the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus during fear memory recall
and 4) the temporal dynamics of oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation and differentiation in vivo after
memory encoding. These studies will provide the first ever evidence for bidirectional interaction between new
myelin formation and active memory encoding ensembles and will elucidate fundamental mechanisms of glial
signaling during learning and memory."
10810864,"ABSTRACT
Cirrhosis – the end-stage result of chronic liver disease – is a condition with high morbidity and
mortality that is becoming increasingly common. Nearly half of all patients with cirrhosis develop
hepatic decompensation including hepatocellular cancer (HCC), with frequent hospitalization
within 5 years of cirrhosis diagnosis. Several studies show that these cirrhosis complications
disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and persons of low socioeconomic status (SES).
But fundamental questions remain unanswered given that only few studies investigated the
mechanisms that underlie these disparities. The research proposed here aims to provide
actionable information on what to target to reduce cirrhosis prognosis disparities. We will
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multilevel factors hypothesized to play important roles in
causing racial/ethnic and SES disparities in three key measures of cirrhosis prognosis: a)
hepatic decompensation, including HCC, b) liver-related hospitalization, and c) overall survival.
We propose a large, multicenter, racially and socio-economically diverse cohort study of
cirrhosis patients enrolled from four healthcare systems; the project will combine information
from existing clinical databases, genomic data, and geospatial analyses with patient- and
clinician- surveys to provide unparalleled information about the role of individual, interpersonal,
and community-level factors in the racial/ethnic and SES disparities in cirrhosis prognosis.
The proposed cohort includes representative groups from all racial/ethnic (blacks, Hispanics,
Asian-Pacific Islanders) and SES groups. It also spans the full spectrum of disease severity
(from compensated to advanced decompensated disease), rather than focusing on a few
groups. We will uncover the relative contributions of established (hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B
virus) and emerging (obesity, diabetes) etiological risk factors as well as risk behaviors (alcohol
use) to cirrhosis prognosis disparities. We will also characterize pathways that contribute to
cirrhosis disparities among the high order determinants at the individual (e.g., medical mistrust),
interpersonal (e.g., bias), and community (e.g., access to transportation) levels either directly or
by affecting etiological or behavioral risk factors. Identification of these root cause mechanisms
will identify actionable targets for intervention and policy change. We will also examine a set of
genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms using stored sera in a subset of the cohort to
understand the role of genetic differences, if any, in explaining racial/ethnic disparities."

investigators focusing on the liver and liver injury, gut:liver interactions, and liver:environment/toxicant/drug 
interactions, alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver injury, infectious liver diseases, liver cancer, and new liver 
therapies. The purpose of the administrative core is to provide administrative, fiscal and scientific oversight for 
this Phase II COBRE. This includes the overall career development and research goals of the Phase II 
COBRE (including formative and summative evaluation and specific milestones); the career development plans 
for junior faculty (including plans for transitioning to independence); plans for replacing key personnel (e.g., 
Project PIs, Core leaders, overall PI, pilot project PIs); oversight of the pilot projects; oversight of the 
biostatistical support services; and disseminating information to the lay and scientific communities. 
 Liver diseases are some of the most common, rapidly increasing and poorly recognized health 
problems afflicting Americans. For example, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
is the most common cause of abnormal liver enzymes in the US, affecting about 25% of adults and about 10% 
of children. Alcoholic Liver Disease is an increasing problem among those who drink. Importantly, there is no 
FDA-approved therapy for either NASH or ALD. Toxicant-Induced Liver Injury is an increasingly recognized 
industrial/environmental problem. Viral Liver Diseases (Hepatitis A, B, and C) remain major health problems 
related to drug abuse and homelessness. Hepatocellular carcinoma and Hepatitis C are major causes for liver 
related morbidity and liver transplantation in the US. Drug-Induced Liver Injury is the major reason new drugs 
do not come to market and the major cause of fulminant liver failure in the US. Personalized Medicine is 
increasingly recognized as an important aspect of drug therapy; and most drugs are metabolized in the liver. 
 Building on the success of the Phase I COBRE Administrative Core, the specific aims of this Phase II 
COBRE Administrative Core are: 
 1. continue to provide overall administrative, fiscal and scientific oversight 
 2. enhance and grow the career development enterprise for project PIs 
 3. enhance and grow the career development/mentor development enterprise for the mentors 
 4. enhance and grow the research goals of the COBRE 
 5. continue to provide a process for replacing key personnel 
 6. continue to provide and enhance a summative and formative evaluation process for the COBRE,

Accumulating data points to dramatic immunologic changes during pregnancy and early life. However, how these
immune perturbations alter the immune response to vaccination or to infection have yet to be fully defined. Under
Core 1, in depth comprehensive characterization will be performed on the humoral immune response to improve
our understanding of the mechanisms by which the immune system changes throughout pregnancy, how these
changes affect responses to vaccines and how infants benefit from maternal immunity and in turn respond to
vaccines. Specifically, Core 1 will exploit and evolve Systems Serology to broadly and deeply probe the nature
of the humoral immune response in a sample sparing manner, via the development of multiplexed-antibody
profiling approaches. Additionally Core 1 will develop lower-throughput functional assays to probe the interaction
between antibodies and host-innate immune cells, in a fully autologous fashion, to define the overall impact of
altered antibody and cellular state in pregnancy and early life. Thus Core 1 will deeply interrogate and define
changes in humoral immunity throughout pregnancy, at birth, and throughout early infant life. The Core leader
will provide all the expertise, infrastructure, reagents, personnel, and training, to ensure the efficient and
successful analysis and deployment of this technology under Projects 1 & 2, as well as support in generating
data for Projects 2 & 4. Thus the main role of this Core is to provide the leadership and the technical expertise
to ensure that antibody assays are run in a standard fashion, that novel technologies evolve from this Core to
support the needs of the overall Consortium, and that the Consortium is kept abreast of the latest developments
in assessing antibody responses."

 The accumulation of damaged, misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins in
neurodegenerative diseases reflects corruption of cellular protein homeostasis (or
“proteostasis”). Proteostasis is the proper balance of protein synthesis and protein degradation
that is required for optimal cellular functioning. The identification of misfolded proteins and their
targeting to the major degradative pathways (i.e., the proteasome or the autophagy pathway)
are highly regulated processes. A key protein in this process is RAD23. RAD23 promotes the
degradation of some proteins and stabilizes cellular levels of other proteins. The mechanism
underlying these diametrically opposed operations is not understood. Interestingly, ablation of
rad23 accelerates the destruction several disease-causing, aggregation-prone mutated proteins
(i.e., polyQ expanded Ataxin3, TDP43, SOD) and confers benefits in a variety of model
systems. We hypothesize that RAD23 bridges ubiquitinated misfolded proteins with the
proteasome and in doing so, sterically or allosterically inhibits proteasome function. In this way,
RAD23 impairs proteostasis. In specific aim #1, we will use imaging and biochemical
approaches to test this mechanism of RAD23 action. In in vitro and C.elegans models of ALS,
loss of RAD23 is health promoting – whether this is true in mouse models is unknown.
Mammals have 2 rad23 isoforms, rad23A and rad23B. In specific aims 2-4, we will use genetic
and anti-sense oligomer technology to ablate and/or knockdown rad23A, rad23B or both in
several mouse models of ALS. We will comprehensively interrogate the effects of loss of
rad23A/B on mouse survival, behavior and biochemistry. The successful completion of these
studies has the potential to be translated into clinical therapeutics."
10832614,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Chronic inflammation likely underlies the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder
(MDD) in a significant number of cases but we do not understand why these individuals get stuck in an
inflammatory state. We hypothesize that this subgroup of depressed patients has a defective homeostatic or
regulatory response to inflammatory stimuli such that appropriate, acute inflammatory responses fail to resolve,
leading to chronic inflammation which increases the risk for (a) developing depression, (b) its recurrence, and
(c) treatment failure. To test this hypothesis, we propose challenging the immune system of both MDD subjects
and healthy controls (HC) with an inflammatory stimulus (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) to induce a homeostatic
response. Specifically, 90 MDD and 90 HC participants will be randomized (2:1) to LPS (0.8ng/kg) or saline.
Serial blood draws will be obtained to quantify the pattern of inflammatory response using several inflammatory
markers. At the same time, participants will complete clinical ratings and undergo a pre- and post-LPS MRI
scan to measure how the transient inflammatory response affects the brain processing of interoceptive (bodily-
relevant) stimuli. Participants will also return one day and one week after LPS/saline infusion to complete
identical psychometric measures and blood draws. The MDD group, only, will also complete psychological
assessments once per month for 6 months in order to determine whether the acute response to LPS predicts
the clinical course of MDD. The main hypotheses are that: (1) relative to HC, the MDD group will show a
greater acute increase in inflammatory mediators but a blunted acute response of the neural circuitry mediating
interoceptive processes (insula and cingulate cortex) in the LPS vs. placebo condition. For the acute outcomes
we focus on the changes that occur at the peak of the inflammatory response, i.e. 2 hours post-infusion. (2).
Within the MDD group, LPS-associated changes in interoceptive processing and functional connectivity will be
correlated with the strength of the acute pro-inflammatory response. (3) These acute effects will be more
salient in MDD participants with chronic inflammation (baseline CRP ³3mg/L). That is, relative to the low
inflammation MDD group (CRP £1mg/L), the high inflammation MDD group will display a blunted
hemodynamic response of the insula and cingulate during internally-focused attention. In exploratory analyses
we will also examine whether there is a sex by diagnosis interaction effect on inflammatory and insular
response to LPS and whether the acute effects of LPS will relate to depressive symptoms over the 6-month
follow-up. This research is innovative and highly impactful because it will open up a new program of research
that will allow us to draw strong conclusions about the biological mechanisms underlying the failure to resolve
inflammation-related depressive behavior. This knowledge can ultimately be used to develop new brain or
immune-based treatments to jump-start the neural circuitry normally engaged by inflammatory stimuli, and to
target these interventions at specific patient populations."
10798264,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rodent-borne viral outbreaks are increasing in both frequency and impact. As weather patterns evolve, rodent
populations are affected and may multiply in areas where increased contact with humans results in infection.
Hantaviruses, including Andes (ANDV) and Sin Nombre (SNV), are transmitted through the excreta of infected
rodents and, when aerosolized, infect humans. In the Americas, hantavirus infection leads to hantavirus
cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), a devastating condition that features rapid onset of pulmonary edema,
respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. Treatment is supportive, not pathogen-targeted, and accordingly,
approximately 40% of patients do not survive. Because hantaviruses establish lifelong, asymptomatic
infections in their rodent reservoirs, they are highly prevalent in nature and represent a constant threat to
humans. For example, SNV is carried by the most abundant mammal in North America, the deer mouse, which
has a near ubiquitous distribution throughout the US and Canada. In the case of the South American ANDV, in
addition to rodent-to-human transmission, human-to-human transmission occurs, putting not only the patient,
but also family members and health care workers at risk. Despite this large potential for infection and the high
case fatality rate, there are no FDA-approved treatment options or vaccines available. Hantaviruses are thus
classified as NIAID Priority Pathogens and considered potential bioterrorism threats. Our long term goal is to
develop an effective therapeutic against HCPS-causing hantaviruses.
This proposal seeks to develop human neutralizing antibodies for therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of
HCPS caused by ANDV. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of molecular virologists, clinicians, and
industry partners with experience developing antibody-based therapeutics. The successful development of a
potent neutralizing antibody against ANDV has the potential to be a first-line antiviral for the treatment or
prevention of HCPS."

doctorate degrees. While the foundation for the development of biomedical Ph.D. and MD/Ph.D. graduates
primarily focuses on the recruitment of younger students, gaps in the Ph.D. or MD/Ph.D. pipeline still exists
with underrepresented populations, due to limited role models, expectations, and resources to pursue excep-
tional doctoral training. Nationally, the step between undergraduate and graduate school is often a barrier in
the biomedical doctoral degree pipeline. This barrier is exacerbated by limited access to substantive biomedi-

10830288,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Influenza A viruses exhibit extreme diversity as exemplified by the multiple serotypes of the hemagglutinin
(HA, H1-H18) and neuraminidase (NA, N1-N11) surface antigens. To date, only 3 of 198 possible combinations
of HA and NA in avian and other animal reservoirs have been associated with human pandemics (H1N1, H2N2,
H3N2). Recent appearances of H5N1, H6N1, H7N7, H7N9, H9N2, and H10N8 in humans are constant reminders
of the potential for devastating new pandemics. Influenza B viruses with its two lineages further increase the
health and economic burdens of seasonal influenza. No effective antiviral drugs are currently available for
preventing entry of influenza A or B viruses into host cells (scientific premise). However, relatively recent
discoveries of broadly neutralizing antibodies to human influenza viruses and concomitant structural studies
have identified sites-of-vulnerability on the HA in pandemic, seasonal, and emerging influenza viruses. These
HA surface sites include the receptor binding site and membrane-proximal stem housing the fusion machinery,
both of which are essential for cellular infection. Common features for recognition of these sites can now be
exploited in design of small molecules to ultimately develop broadly applicable influenza antivirals.
 Here, we will employ this structural information into the optimization and execution of high-throughput assays
to identify new small-molecule scaffolds that target the highly conserved and vulnerable stem-binding site. High-
throughput screening will be performed in parallel on representative HAs from influenza A group 1 against 600K
structurally diverse molecules (SA1). We will also subject group 2 and influenza B HAs to a 300K compound
screen (SA2). Validated hit compounds will be prioritized based on affinity and breadth across HAs and top
candidates will be rigorously optimized into lead molecules by x-ray structure-based design cycled with medicinal
chemistry. Biophysical binding, cellular infectivity and resistance assays (e.g., combinatorial viral libraries of HA
mutants) will aid in iterative design, selection, and characterization of potential novel therapeutic candidates with
favorable drug-like properties. All of these methods are actively employed in the Wolan and Wilson laboratories.
As proof-of-concept for this approach, we identified a molecule with modest affinity to the stem of group 1 HAs
with an HT assay of our own design. Its co-crystal structure with HA provided critical information towards design
and synthesis of a focused compound library, which we used to produce a stereoselective molecule with
nanomolar affinity and antiviral activity. Our overall goal is to identify and improve molecules with broad potency
against the stem of groups 1 and 2 as well as flu B HAs. To our knowledge, we are the first to design an assay
against group 2 and flu B HAs amenable to HTS (innovation). We anticipate that several classes of stem-targeted
compound scaffolds will be identified with nanomolar affinity to HAs with cellular antiviral activity and suitable
PK-ADME properties. Future efforts will include animal models of influenza infections to further validate our
antivirals with the ultimate goal of combatting future influenza pandemics and seasonal epidemics."
10827920,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), especially with diffusion contrast, has been the undisputed standard
of care for the detection and diagnosis of neonatal brain disorders and injuries such as Hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy (HIE). However, the nature of these large, expensive, potentially dangerous instruments limits
accessibility and requires that patients be transported to a radiology suite. In the neonatal intensive care unit
(NICU) setting, patient transfer introduces safety concerns, since it requires a full hand-off of patient care
responsibilities and exposes the neonate to stress from transport and acoustic noise. In particular, HIE patients
are often not stable enough to transfer to the scanner for several days after birth. Instead bed-side cranial
imaging is performed with ultrasound, which has a low sensitivity for early abnormalities associated with HIE.
 We design a bed-side scanner specifically for the needs of neonatal brain imaging in an NICU. The
proposed scanner will be transported to the bedside in the NICU, prioritizing minimal handling and
manipulation of the infant and enabling true POC diagnostics and monitoring. We significantly reduce the size,
cost, and complexity of conventional MRI hardware by designing for the smaller FOV needed for neonatal
brain imaging and significantly depart from the canonical scanner design. The magnet, field gradients, and RF
coils will be optimized for the smaller imaging volume to maximize image quality. To allow operation outside an
RF shielded room, we propose an EMI mitigation method that retrospectively removes artifacts using external
detectors. As DWI imaging is highly valuable in the HIE patient population, we will develop a RARE DWI
sequence for the unconventional scanner architecture. The new scanner will first be validated with an
anthropomorphic neonatal phantom with realistic tissue properties and then at the MGH Neonatal ICU as an
addition to the standard care of HIE patients. We will determine if the POC MRI offers valuable early
information about the brain condition, which is corroborated in later high-field MRI images obtained when the
baby is stable enough to be transferred to the conventional scanner."
10833015,"The study of budding yeast has provided fundamental insights into the cell biological processes of all
eukaryotes. Its study has also made critical contributions to the understanding and treatment of human disorders
like diabetes, congenital disabilities, and cancer. My laboratory uses budding yeast to interrogate three areas of
cell biology, the higher-order structure of chromosomes, the prevention of chromosome damage and
rearrangements, and the mitigation of environmental stress.
 The basic unit of chromosomes is chromatin, which is composed of the DNA and associated proteins.
The organization of chromatin into higher-order structures is essential for high fidelity chromosome segregation,
the repair of DNA damage, and the regulation of gene expression. The molecular mechanisms that organize
chromatin are major mysteries in cell biology. In this proposal, we study chromatin organization through the
analysis of cohesin, a member of the SMC (Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes) family of protein
complexes. Cohesin contributes to chromosome organization by tethering together different chromatin regions
within a chromosome or between chromosomes. Cohesin also translocates along a chromosome to extrude
loops. This proposal interrogates the molecular mechanisms underlying cohesin's tethering and loop-extrusion
activities, the regulation of these activities, and their impact on chromosome structure and function in living cells.
 Cells also maintain genome stability by preventing and repairing chromosome damage. Chromosome
damage is often caused by errors in the execution of intrinsic cellular processes. Indeed, during transcription, an
RNA transcript can erroneously hybridize with homologous double-stranded DNA sequences on the
chromosomes to generates an RNA-DNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA. This unusual structure,
called an R-loop, can cause DNA damage and chromosome rearrangements. Here, we present experiments to
understand why only a subset of R-loops in a genome cause DNA damage and how this damage leads to the
large chromosome rearrangements that are a common feature of cancer cells.
 Finally, cellular stress also arises from extrinsic environmental changes. Understanding how some
organisms survive extreme environmental changes has provided critical technical and conceptual advances in
biology. We study the ability of yeast to survive desiccation. We showed that the expression of a small protein
and simple sugar in yeast is necessary and sufficient for yeast to survive desiccation. These two factors prevent
the aggregation of model proteins and modulate membranes in vitro. Here, we propose to elucidate the
remarkable biological functions of these two factors by identifying the specific cellular proteins and membranes
that they protected during desiccation. These studies will provide fundamental insights into protein and
membrane homeostasis beyond desiccation and may generate potential novel applications for biomedicine and
agriculture."
10829426,"Abstract
Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 infection is not curable due to the presence of viral
latent reservoirs primarily in long-lived resting memory CD4+ T cells. The viral latent reservoirs
are the major barrier to HIV-1 eradication. The “shock and kill” strategy for HIV-1 eradication
involves the use of latency-reversing agents (LRAs) to induce viral gene expression, which
renders the infected cells susceptible to viral cytopathic effects or immune clearance. However,
in ART-treated patients, the latent HIV-1 resides in cells is resistant to viral- or immune-mediated
apoptotic cell death and often carries mutations to escape recognition by T cells or antibodies.
Therefore, novel approaches to target immutable components of the virus such as essential viral
protein functions are needed. Inflammasome is a critical molecular complex that mediates
inflammation and pyroptotic cell death in response to microbial or danger signals. In humans, the
physiologic ligand(s) for the CARD8 inflammasome remains unknown. Our studies demonstrate
that HIV-1 protease degrades the CARD8 N-terminal domain and releases the C-terminus for
inflammasome activation. In HIV-1-infected cells, the viral protease remains inactive as a subunit
of viral Gag-Pol polyprotein. After virus budding, it is activated through Gag-Pol dimerization. We
show that premature activation of intracellular HIV-1 protease by non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) triggers CARD8 sensing and killing of HIV-infected macrophages
and CD4+ T cells. All subtypes of HIV-1 can be sensed by CARD8 despite substantial viral
diversity. Our finding suggests that targeted activation of CARD8 inflammasome is a promising
strategy to eliminate latent HIV-1 reservoirs. In this proposed study, we will: 1) perform ex vivo
assessment and optimization of the CARD8-based “shock and kill strategy” for clearing latent
HIV-1 in patient CD4+ T cells; 2) understand the molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 protease-
mediated CARD8 inflammasome activation; 3) test CARD8-based “shock and kill” strategy in
humanized mouse model of HIV-1 latency. Our proposed study will advance the understanding
of the physiological mechanisms of CARD8 inflammasome activation and its role in HIV-1
infection, which will provide critical implications to HIV cure research."
10835950,"Movement abilities affect a child’s physical, social and emotional well-being, as well as their educational
success—all of which can last a lifetime. Movement is fundamental to the development of abilities across
domains (motor, cognitive), because it underlies a child’s ability to explore and interact with the environment and
other people. How children learn movement is a complex process that changes with development, experience
and injury. It depends on a suite of interacting brain mechanisms that are driven by different signals (e.g. reward,
error), have different learning rates, retention capacities, contextual dependencies and vulnerabilities to
neurological damage. A key gap in human neuroscience is our limited understanding of this complex interplay.
We propose to leverage recently developed home-based experimental tasks and new laboratory methods to
generate high resolution time courses for different components of childhood motor learning, and then determine
how they are affected by neurological lesions. With these data we can create a detailed flowchart of movement
learning capacity and the effects of disease, as a function of age and developmental markers. This would provide

10848348,"Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death, worldwide. The most common underlying cause of ischemic
heart disease and stroke is atherosclerosis. Three seminal studies, the Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis
Outcomes Study (CANTOS), Low Dose Colchicine for Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (LoDoCo2), and
the Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (COLCOT), have proven the hypothesis that atherosclerosis is an
inflammatory disease, and that targeting mechanisms of inflammation can reduce major adverse cardiac events
independent of lipid lowering. The work proposed here represents a drug discovery and development program designed to
target residual inflammatory risk in patients with atherosclerosis. It is in response to the funding opportunity
announcement RFA-HL-23-011 titled “Catalyze: Product Definition for Small Molecules and Biologics - Target
Identification and Validation, and Preliminary Product/Lead Series Identification (R61/R33).” Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was
the target of canakinumab in the CANTOS trial. Inflammatory cells like activated monocytes and macrophage are a
significant source of interleukin-1β in atherosclerotic plaques. Its transcription is under tight control, and maximum
expression of this cytokine in inflammatory leukocytes requires adhesion dependent signaling through integrins. Integrins
transmit signals into cells through direct interactions between their cytoplasmic domains and intracellular effectors.
Integrin β-chain cytoplasmic domains interact directly with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Syk, which is an essential
kinase in the production of IL-1β. In previous work, we determined that β-chain cytoplasmic domain interactions with Syk
were druggable, and an antagonist of this interaction could prevent integrin mediated upregulation of IL-1β in monocytes.
In the current proposal we seek to extend this work by performing a structure-guided virtual screen of over 10 million
compounds to identify potent and cell-permeable drugs that can be used as starting points in drug discovery and
development. Our objective in the R61 component of this award is to identify compounds from modeling and molecular
dynamics simulations that can be validated in both cell-free, and cell-based assays of integrin:Syk interactions. Once strict
“hit” criteria have been met, they will enter into the R33 component of this award mechanism for assessment of potential
toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in an acute model of inflammation in mice. The studies proposed here will
identify a lead series of compounds for drug development, with the ultimate goal being to develop a novel, first-in-class
approach to pharmacologically target residual inflammatory risk. CANTOS, LoDoCo2, and COLCOT demonstrated that
targeting IL-1β either directly or indirectly is a viable approach to treat residual inflammatory risk in atherosclerosis. The
proposed approach would target upstream signals in the regulation of IL-1β in inflammatory leukocytes."
10890072,"Lung disease caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is associated with substantial short and long-term
morbidity for infants and children. Despite this far-reaching disease burden, current management is limited.
Developing an effective intervention for acute infection with RSV would have an enormous impact on
the public health of children. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a protease that has been implicated in
RSV pathogenesis. Azithromycin (AZM) is a commonly used macrolide antibiotic with a well-known safety
profile that has immunomodulatory effects that have been beneficial against other inflammatory airway
diseases and may work through an MMP-9-based mechanism of action. We completed a Phase II, randomized
controlled trial (RCT) of high-dose AZM [20 mg/kg (IV) x 3 days], and demonstrated that the treatment was
safe and associated with decreased hospital length of stay and decreased endotracheal MMP-9 concentrations
in mechanically-ventilated children. Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence that justifies
a multi-centered Phase III RCT to determine the effectiveness of AZM. The overarching hypothesis of the
ARRC Trial (AZM treatment for RSV-induced Respiratory Failure in Children) is administration of AZM during
acute, RSV-induced respiratory failure will be beneficial, mediated through an MMP-9 pathway. To test this
overall hypothesis, we have developed a research network of pediatric critical care physicians to enroll 370
children in a double-masked placebo-controlled RCT of high-dose AZM. Inclusion criteria will be age less
than 2 years and acute respiratory failure secondary to RSV infection requiring ICU admission with intensive
respiratory support [defined as mechanical ventilation, non-invasive bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP),
continuous positive end-expiratory pressure (CPAP) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy of > 1L/kg/min
of flow]. Exclusion criteria includes previous use of AZM within 7 days, cardiac arrhythmias, chronic home
ventilation/oxygenation and immunosuppressive conditions. We will test the following aims: 1: High-dose
AZM administration will result in decreased length of hospital stay, decreased duration of oxygen therapy and
decreased ICU length of stay. Enrolled patients will be administered high-dose AZM or placebo, receive all
other therapies based on standard American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for RSV infection, and
outcomes will be assessed; 2: Administration of high-dose AZM will result in reduced number of wheezing
episodes over 12 months after primary infection and the time to the first wheezing episode and 3: Nasal
markers of MMP-9 driven lung inflammation will be decreased in patients receiving AZM, and predictive of
outcome. Successful completion of this impactful grant application will determine the effectiveness of AZM on
the recovery of children with severe RSV infection. A positive result from this trial will represent a paradigm
shift in the management of severe RSV infection, as the first successful treatment for acute and post-RSV
related respiratory exacerbation and has the potential to identify novel biomarkers of disease outcome."

untranslated region of mRNA and regulates mRNA stability via a mechanism that involves the RNA-induced
silencing complex. In more recent work, we found that IGF2BP3 also binds near 3’-splice sites, and may
regulate alternative splicing. Together, our findings suggest dual roles in mRNA regulation for IGF2BP3.
IGF2BP3 regulates genes that are related to proliferation, migration, and signaling- which are important in fetal
development- but also in cancer. Concordant with this gene regulatory function, IGF2BP3 is overexpressed in a
wide range of malignancies, including acute leukemia, and portends a poor prognosis when highly expressed.
Using novel, murine genetic models of IGF2BP3 deficiency, we have now discovered that IGF2BP3 is required
for the development of a fully-penetrant, lethal leukemia in vivo. Together, our extensive prior work, both
published and unpublished, provides a mechanistic framework for its function, and a solid foundation for the
importance of this protein in disease. To fully understand the nature of these protein-RNA interactions and to
understand their role in cancer, we propose two aims. In the first aim, we will carefully delineate the mechanism
underlying IGF2BP3 function by a combination of carefully executed experiments (Aim 1). In the second aim,
we will characterize the importance of IGF2BP3 in leukemia initiation, propagation and maintenance using a set
of carefully constructed genetic models and gene editing in primary cells. Next, we will characterize how the two
proposed gene regulatory mechanisms- RNA stability and pre-mRNA splicing- play roles in cancer initiation,
using a combination of reverse genetics, miRNA regulation, and isoform specific expression. Together, this work
will lead to a layered, detailed understanding of how mechanistic basis of protein-RNA interactions is intimately
connected to gene expression deregulation and the malignant transformation of cells. Importantly, it will pave
the way to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in malignancies characterized by massive
transcriptomic dysregulation underpinned by alterations of RNA-binding proteins."

This is a first renewal application for continued funding for the Cole Eye Institute Vision
Science Training Program (CEIVSTP) which is specifically designed to train pre-doctoral
Ph.D. students, medical students and post-doctoral fellows to become future leaders in
ophthalmology research. With T32 funds that provided training for 3 predoctoral students
and one post-doctoral fellow per year, we have supported 12 predoctoral students and 4
post-doctoral fellows over the past 4 years. One of our major long-term goals at the Cole
Eye Institute is to use CEIVSTP to limit and eventually merge the boundaries that now
separate clinical and basic research in ophthalmology. This training program is uniquely
positioned to achieve this goal for the following reasons: First, the trainers in this program
have been selected for their ability to perform outstanding ophthalmology research with
a translational focus on eye diseases. Second, the clinical mentors in the program are
highly successful clinicians with proven track records in research and a commitment to
the goals of the training program. Third, both a basic and clinician scientist will mentor
each trainee. Fourth, the housing of this program under one roof in the Cole Eye Institute
establishes a cohesive and comprehensive environment particularly suited to this
purpose. Fifth, the close interactions between medical students and Ph.D. students during
the research training, will promote communication between the clinical and basic areas
and foster scientific networks and collaborations that can continue into the future. The
strong didactic, research and clinical component of this program together with the novel
curriculum of the Molecular Medicine Ph.D. program will provide a solid foundation in
basic scientific principles in the context of human ocular biology and disease. This
proposal seeks continued funding for training outstanding pre-doctoral graduate
students, medical students working toward a masters level thesis and post-doctoral
fellows committed to ophthalmic research."
10795046,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
We aim to define host factors that are associated with the more virulent human rhinoviruses (RV), RV-A and RV-
C. Although RV are the most frequent cause of the common cold, they also provoke more severe manifestations,
particularly in those with underlying lung disease. RV are the most frequent cause of asthma exacerbations,
specifically induced by RV-A and RV-C, and only rarely RV-B. We have found that RV-A and RV-C require the
host factor Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) for replication of their genome, while RV-B do not. Although
STING is an immune adaptor critical for immune sensing in DNA viruses, its importance during RNA infections
is becoming increasing recognized. In humans, STING1 exists as multiple variant alleles containing one or more
single nucleotide polymorphisms. The most common STING variant is deficient in type I interferon (IFN-I)
signaling, while other common variants have reduced IFN-I. As RV are restricted to only infect humans, we have
found that for RV-A and RV-C, STING is a restricting host factor. While human STING robustly supports RV-A
and RV-C replication, murine STING does not. The three Aims of the Project will explore the mechanism for
STING host factor activity, determine how natural STING alleles influence RV-A and RV-C replication, and
identify which nonstructural components of the virus interact with STING or the STING complex to promote
infection. By studying the host factor role of STING during RV replication, the proposed research will define
factors important for the increased virulence between RV species in this important human pathogen."

Located in Orangeburg, South Carolina, Claflin University (CU), an independent, four-year, co-educational,
residential, career-oriented liberal arts university, is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. Founded in
1869, CU is the oldest historically black college/university (HBCU) in South Carolina. Over 90% of the student
body is African American and 39% are first generation college students, making CU a vital part of local, regional,
and national efforts to recruit minority and female students into advanced degrees and research-oriented careers
in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Our commitment to train future
scientists and engineers through hands-on, research pursuits under the direct mentorship of active science and
engineering faculty has emerged as our primary pedagogic paradigm. All students in Claflin’s School of Natural
Sciences and Mathematics (SNSM) are required to participate in research that culminates in a senior research
thesis or research proposal. The proposed Undergraduate-Research Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-
RISE) targets interdisciplinary research with 18 U-RISE Trainees, recruited, selected, and retained using a
holistic approach, under the supervision of 15 researchers at CU and in collaboration with biomedical researchers
in research-intensive environments focusing on National Institutes of Health Training Programs over a five-year
period. Projects will be conducted in various laboratories (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics-Computer Science
and Engineering) in SNSM, with selected projects integrated with community-based participatory public health
research to address pertinent health disparities in collaboration with the School of Humanities and external
research collaborators. Faculty mentors will complete required training activities that include topics of Diversity
Training and Cultural Sensitivity. Trainees will complete required courses, Introduction to Research and
Research Ethics, and participate in weekly sessions to include journal clubs, Responsible Conduct of Research,
CITI modules, writing modules, and cultural sensitivity modules, Graduate Record Exam Preparation,
application for internships, application for graduate school, oral and poster preparation and practice, manuscript
preparation, and interview skills. Moreover, team building sessions throughout the program, from orientation
to graduation, will provide a supportive environment. Students’ preparation, enthusiasm, and self-confidence
will enhance career development with an increased number of underrepresented students entering and
completing Ph.D. programs in biomedical-focused areas. As a result, we aim to place 33% of trainees (2
graduating trainees) into Ph.D. programs yearly after the third year, 6 at the end of 5 years, within 3 years of
graduation, building upon strategic plans for recruitment, selection, and retention as well as upon
implementation of efficient tracking to completion. With these plans implemented properly from lessons learned
in our RISE program and from other successful programs, we anticipate a significant increase in students’
matriculating into Ph.D. and MD/Ph.D. programs because of the number entering Master’s Programs."
10835001,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuberculosis disease (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in young children <5 yr old. The vulnerability of young children to develop TB following primary infection
is not understood; this critical knowledge gap hampers efforts to develop a more effective vaccine and improved
diagnostic tests for this high-risk population. HIV-exposed (HEU) children are the majority of children living in the
homes of HIV+ adults, where they are more likely than HIV-unexposed-uninfected (HUU) children to be TB
exposed. Clinical, epidemiologic, and immunologic findings support that young, HEU children will exhibit
distinctive immune responses following Mtb-exposure; however, immune responses to Mtb-infection have not
been characterized in this high-risk population. Our proposal will comprehensively define adaptive immune
responses to Mtb-exposure and TB in children < 5yr using a pediatric TB household contact (HHC) study based
in Kampala, Uganda, where up to 20% of children are HEU. Our approach will identify unique immunologic
biosignatures driven by where the child sits on the TB disease spectrum, as well as by HIV-exposure status. We
hypothesize that immune biosignatures of Mtb-exposed asymptomatic HEU children will more closely resemble
those observed among children with TB, as compared to asymptomatic HUU children. If proven, this would
suggest that Mtb-exposed HEU children are more likely to be experiencing a pre-clinical rather than quiescent
or latent Mtb-infection. Such findings would have implications for the development of immune-based diagnostics
for Mtb-infection and TB disease that may perform differently in HIV-exposed and unexposed children, as well
as clinical management and monitoring of HEU-children following TB exposure. Working with a biorepository of
samples obtained from Ugandan children < 5 yr, and a proposed prospective cohort of Ugandan children < 5 yr
who are TB HHC, we will address three specific aims that: 1) define longitudinal, functional and phenotypic Mtb-
specific adaptive immune responses among young children who developed TB or remained asymptomatic; 2)
develop a pool of novel Mtb-epitopes and focused flow cytometry-based assay customized to detect Mtb-specific
T cell responses in young children; and 3) establish a unique Mtb-specific antibody Fc profile that defines children
with TB. Our proposal will advance pediatric global health by: 1) identification of immunologic signatures
reflecting successful containment of primary Mtb infection that can serve as correlates of protective immunity for
novel vaccine trials; 2) development of novel blood-based assays that discriminate between young children with
TB and those whom have been exposed but successfully contained their infection."
10588483,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In 2022, an estimated 236,740 patients in the US are expected to be diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and 130,180 deaths. In 2019 and 2020, the Veteran Health Administration estimates 8,352 and 6,111
new lung cancer diagnoses and 4,284 and 2,344 deaths from lung cancer, respectively. Management of Stage
III unresectable NSCLC underwent a monumental change with the NEJM publication of the PACIFIC trial in
2017. Maintenance immunotherapy after chemoradiation became the standard with median overall survival
(mOS) nearly doubling to 47.5 months compared to chemo-radiation alone. While with durvalumab, the
progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 60 months was 33.1%, compared to placebo (i.e. chemoradiation alone)
which was 19.0%, the findings suggest that 1 in 2 patients is likely to not receive added benefit from
durvalumab. The problem then becomes, who should receive immunotherapy over and above chemoradiation?
By identifying only those Veterans who will receive benefit will result in a significant cost savings for the VA
health care system. Second, many Veterans within the VA Healthcare System travel > 50 miles for their
treatments. By eliminating unnecessary trips for inefficacious therapy, the quality of life of our Veterans will be
enhanced. Similarly, given the cost and associated toxicity of these IO based regimens there is a need to identify
which patients will benefit from a short treatment duration (i.e. 6 months versus the typical 1 year duration).
Finally, there is a need to identify which patients are likely to suffer from immune related adverse events (irAEs),
specifically pneumonitis, seen in approximately 1/3 of lung cancer patients treated with IO.
 Our group has pioneered the development of novel artificial intelligence (AI) based radiomic (computer
extracted) features of the tortuosity of the nodule vasculature and textural patterns both inside and outside the
nodule on CT scans, and demonstrated strong association between these features with response to (1)
durvalumab+chemoradiation in Stage III NSCLC, (2) in first line chemo+IO and (3) overall survival in NSCLC
patients treated with IO. In recent work published in the J of Immunotherapy for Cancer (JITC), our group showed
that intra- and peritumoral radiomic texture features were associated with disease free survival (DFS) in Stage
III NSCLC patients treated with durvalumab+chemoradiation. The radiomic features were associated with clinical
outcome in both the low and high PD-L1 groups. More recently, in work to be presented at ASCO 2022, we have
shown that radiomic features on CT scans can distinguish radiation induced from IO induced pneumonitis.
 In this project, we aim to develop and validate RadIO, a novel radiomic toolkit to (1) predict at baseline
which Veterans will receive added benefit from durvalumab over chemo-radiation alone, (2) determine when a
disease stable status has been achieved so that an IO duration prediction can be made (6 months vs 12 months),
and (4) predict pneumonitis to inform Veteran care. We anticipate that RadIO will outperform current clinical
standards (e.g. PD-L1). In addition, we will establish the biological underpinnings of these predictive radiomic
signatures by evaluating their association with the morphology, immune landscape (from biopsies) and molecular
pathways of the tumor. We will have access to over 1000 Stage III NSCLC patients treated with chemo-radiation
versus durvalumab+chemoradiation. Data from VA patients will be available from the Atlanta, Cleveland, Ann
Arbor, and Richmond VA Healthcare Systems. In addition, we have access to >1000 Stage III NSCLC patients
from completed clinical trials from our pharma partners, Astrazeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and also from
University Hospitals, Cleveland Clinic and New York University. Criterion for project success will involve
demonstrating that RadIO significantly outperforms clinically employed metrics (e.g. RECIST, irRC) and
biomarkers (e.g. PDL1, Tumor mutational burden [TMB]) in predicting treatment response, optimal treatment
duration and likelihood of pneumonitis."
10914635,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to develop a new method for fiber sampling. The method currently used for airborne
sampling of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is adapted from micrometer-scale asbestos sampling. To achieve our
goal, we will study surface properties of different CNTs and sampling filters contributing to efficiency, develop a
novel image analysis protocol with our algorithms, use a newly developed nanoparticle (NP) isokinetic diffusion
sampler, simulate and elucidate the particle behavior, and produce a new method suitable to CNTs sampling.
Burden: Exposure to airborne CNTs has been of highest concern following their designation as a potential
human carcinogen. The potential health effects of CNTs have shown some similarity to those of asbestos fibers
in animal models. CNTs global market is projected to reach $103.2 billion by 2030 with 16.3% annual growth.
The fiber sampling method used for asbestos has been a recommended method for sampling CNT fibers. CNTs
contain individual fibers with diameters that are one tenth to one hundredth that of asbestos fibers. The NIOSH
Methods 7402 was found to be very challenging and time consuming for identifying a few very fine CNT fibers
on a grid sample under electron microscopy. Questions raised by this challenge include whether the number and
size of CNT fibers collected by 7402 method are representative of those in the air, whether these sizes are
affected by the sampling and extensive processing required by the method, and how the exposure to fine fibers
can be quantified properly to evaluate associated health effects when this method is not yet validated for CNT.
Need: A new method and technique for sampling fine fibers to 1) collect fibers efficiently in the sampled air
without loss, 2) directly analyze the collected fibers with minimal processing of the sample, and 3) easily count
the fibers to obtain the concentration and size, which will resolve the lack of accuracy of exposure measurements
and the significant time requirement of sample analysis. When used for CNTs, the collection efficiency and
performance of sampling and analysis must be evaluated. It is critical to design a new sampling substrate
because the currently used mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filter for collecting asbestos may not be suitable for
collecting CNTs. The fibers collected on the MCE filter need to be processed for transfer to a grid for analysis,
small fibers can be agglomerated or lost. A new sampling method and substrate that can effectively collect fibers
to be analyzed directly will prevent the loss or change of collected fibers through the transfer process.
Impact: The wide range of applications that use fiber materials such as CNTs, asbestos and fiberglass and other
NPs can employ the developed protocol and method to effectively quantify the exposure level in terms of
fiber/particle concentration. This information may change the current measurement metric for CNTs from mass
concentration to fiber/particle number concentration. Using more precise counting can characterize the exposure
concentration at a very low and difficult to measure mass concentration and provide associations to related
health effects for a measurement below the current limit of mass quantification for CNTs."

Commercial-scale seafood production in coastal and offshore marine environments is now possible due to
rapidly emerging technical innovations in the field of aquaculture. Marine areas suitable for the development of
offshore aquaculture are currently under evaluation by NOAA's Center for Coastal Ocean Science and include
four study regions in the Southern California Bight. This nationally focused project overlaps with more regional
efforts carried-out by private and public entities to advance bi-valve shellfish aquaculture and thereby
complement southern California's wild-capture fisheries. Apart from its economic benefits to working
waterfront communities and a promising role in bolstering national food security, the expansion of shellfish
aquaculture presents potential risks to public health safety that are linked to naturally occurring biotoxins.
These compounds are produced by certain microalgae and consumed by shellfish destined for commercial
seafood markets, where they present a risk of neurotoxic poisoning for human consumers. This research
education project creates novel opportunities for teachers and students in our coastal communities to explore
the interplay of marine biotoxins, commercial shellfish aquaculture, and public health safety. The project will
unfold in three overlapping phases. During the initial phase of the project, high school science teachers will
participate in a research experience that emulates a traditional university research internship. This introductory
experience is aimed at enhancing teachers' scientific knowledge and subject mastery, and engaging them in
the use of field and laboratory methodologies used in connection with a baseline biotoxin impact study that is
currently underway in our lab. During the second (translational) phase of the project, teachers will collaborate
with our scientists on the creation of a classroom-ready instructional unit aimed at guiding high school students
through a research-oriented exploration of marine biotoxins and their impacts on human health. In addition to
enhancing their scientific knowledge and understanding of science inquiry, this pedagogically focused strand of
the research experience is intended to engage teachers in instructional practices that are widely regarded as
essential for preparing students to participate in the 21st century scientific workforce. Teacher implementation
of the classroom experience during the third project phase will engage high school students in investigational
practices that form the cornerstone of science inquiry and a primary focus of national science education reform
initiatives. During this project phase, students will create a conceptual model to explain the clinical features
presented by patients affected by marine biotoxins. After constructing their models, students will propose a
solution to mitigate the health risks imposed by commercial shellfish aquaculture and conduct hands-on
activities that are routinely used to monitor these risks. An overarching goal of this effort is to develop a
practical blueprint for research-based lesson development that teachers can follow beyond the grant award
period to guide a transformative and enduring shift in their current teaching practices."

Malaria remains one of the most serious infectious diseases, globally threatening nearly 50% of the world
population, and leading to >400,000 deaths annually, mostly among young African children. There are no
effective vaccines and the disease is managed through a combination of insecticides and drugs for both
treatment and chemoprevention. The relentless ability of the parasite to acquire drug resistance necessitates
that a continual pipeline of new drug candidates is maintained. We sought to identify novel chemical starting
points for the discovery of new anti-malarial drugs by phenotypic screening against erythrocytic stage P.
falciparum. We undertook a high-throughput screen of a newly acquired (in 2017) 100K chemical library
reasoning that since it was recently purchased it might contain new chemical space that had not been previously
screened. As part of our hit validation process we prioritized hits from the screen based on the following
experimental measures: 1) potency versus the parasite against two cell lines, 2) selectivity versus a human cell
line, 3) novelty of the chemical matter, 4) parasite kill rate (medium and fast kill being desirable) and 5) in vitro
ADME properties including metabolic stability and solubility. We identified 16 chemical series that met our
objectives of novelty and from these have selected 3 series for hit to lead chemistry. These include a piperidine
carboxamide series (Alchm18) that has a moderate rate of kill, good starting potency (P. falciparum 3D7 EC50
<100 nM), and strong starting in vitro and in vivo ADME properties; a a tetrazole-based series (Alchm3) that
shows fast kill kinetics, and a an azetidine amide (Alchm17), with good potency and solubility. We have validated
synthetic strategies for all three series through synthesis of both the parent compound and analogs. The goal
of this proposal is to conduct hit-to-lead chemistry on these three series, to evaluate their biological profiles,
and to perform studies to identify their targets. The strongest series will then be prioritized for full scale lead
optimization. Our project team of Phillips (parasite biology), Ready (medicinal chemistry) and Charman
(ADME/PK) is highly experienced and has a long track record of working together. The project will also be a
collaborative effort with the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) who will provide in kind support and access
to their in vitro and in vivo parasite efficacy models and project oversight. Upon completion of this proposal we
will have substantial new insight into the developability of three new chemical series, we will have validated up
to three additional new anti-malarial targets, and we will have progressed the strongest of our three chemical
series through lead optimization to identify a potential preclinical development candidate."

Nearly 2 million women pass through U.S. jails each year, with nearly 8,000 admissions of pregnant people
with opioid use disorder (OUD). Providing evidence-based treatment to these individuals is essential to
addressing the opioid epidemic, to optimizing maternal and newborn outcomes, and to promoting maternal
health equity. There is increasing recognition of the critical role of jails in providing access to medication
treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) as a means of curbing the opioid epidemic, reducing overdose
deaths, and promoting racial equity for a group of individuals who are systematically marginalized. While there
is a growing number of jails that are expanding access to MOUD, strategies that are specific to the unique
needs of pregnant people are lacking. Moreover, many jails still do not provide MOUD even in pregnancy,
despite the well-established standard of care of avoiding withdrawal and the known benefits of MOUD
specifically for pregnant individuals. Our long-term goal is to ensure that pregnant people with OUD in jails
receive appropriate and timely care to optimize their long-term wellbeing and that of their infants. The overall
objective is to develop and pilot an adaptable implementation strategy and toolkit for jails to be able to provide
access to pregnancy-specific OUD care. The rationale is that jails vary tremendously in size, resources, and
health care delivery systems, and need tools they can tailor to their environment. Ensuring jails provide access
to MOUD, and in ways that are tailored to the distinctive medical, mental health and social structural aspects of
care for pregnant people with OUD is essential for improving short and long-term pregnancy, recovery, and
intergenerational outcomes. This project will engage multiple stakeholders, including directly impacted people,
to design then pilot a patient-centered and jail-feasible implementation strategy that will facilitate and enhance
jails’ implementation of MOUD for pregnant people. The strategy will contain a menu of tools to assist jails with
immediate needs to provide MOUD to pregnant people entering jails; with pregnancy-tailored counseling; and
with other support services and linkages to care that center the obstetrical, psychosocial, and structural needs
of this population. The implementation strategy will also be adaptable to a variety of types and geographies of
jails. They will then be piloted at four jails with different baseline capacities and services for MOUD for
pregnant people. The steps proposed in this R34 are necessary for building the tools, outcome measures, and
capacity that will be scaled-up in a future R01 hybrid implementation/effectiveness trial to improve OUD
treatment access and maternal and infant health outcomes for this long-overlooked group."

Drinking problems and sleep problems each cause significant loss at individual and societal levels. Insomnia in
particular is highly prevalent in patients with alcohol use disorder, is prospectively associated with the
development of alcohol use disorder and contributes to poorer recovery prognosis following alcohol treatments.
Insomnia, therefore, represents a modifiable risk factor for negative outcomes associated with alcohol use
along the full continuum of alcohol use problems.
Accordingly, the project proposes to improve sleep with an insomnia intervention tailored to individuals who
meet widely accepted definitions for hazardous alcohol use as well as diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder.
This is a treatment development study that will adapt cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia for adults
engaged in hazardous use of alcohol. We propose an iterative approach to development, refinement, and
preliminary examination of the utility of a telephone-delivered, 4-session version of cognitive behavioral therapy
for insomnia adapted to hazardous alcohol users.
The project will begin with a small, open label pilot to develop and refine procedures for administering the
intervention. Then, we will conduct a small, randomized trial comparing the intervention to a sleep and alcohol
education control condition. As this is a treatment development award, we will assess a number of intervention
and study design feasibility domains in preparation for designing a larger study. We will also assess the effects
of the intervention on alcohol use, sleep and mood by measuring these outcomes at baseline, post-treatment,
and at 3- and 6-month follow up assessments.
In sum, this proposal is the first step in a program of research that intends to use sleep as a lever to alter the
course of hazardous alcohol use. Here, the first step is to adapt an already successful insomnia intervention to
a unique population and conduct a preliminary test of that interventions’ acceptability to patients, fidelity by
therapists, and effects on drinking, sleep and mood. If study results are promising, we will use these data and
information gleaned about the study methods to pursue the next phase of research: designing and conducting
a definitive study to test our insomnia intervention’s capacity to decrease alcohol use and modify the course of
hazardous alcohol use."

focus on pediatrics and Tuberculosis (TB) co-morbidity. Other key partners include The University of Texas
School of Public Health (UTHealth SPH) who will support and mentor long-term trainees during Public Health
Masters and Doctoral level studies. Our collaborative HIV/TB training program will train i) three doctoral
candidates to become Independent Investigators in clinical and translational research focusing on HIV/TB in
pediatric (infants, children, and adolescents) populations, and ii) two in-country cohorts of public health trainees
to become Associate Investigators in child health research. The training capitalizes on a novel Eswatini-US dual
mentoring strategy to ensure retention, success, and relevance of research conducted by US-based long-term
Siyakhula Scholars. Long-term Siyakhula Scholars will enroll in UTHealth SPH to earn a PhD or DrPH and
conduct thesis activities in Eswatini engaging in-country Siyakhula Scholars and mentors. We will employ a
""teach-back"" approach in which the long-term trainees participate in Eswatini-based training forums to develop
teaching skills and strengthen partnerships with in-country scholars. Our goal is to strengthen clinical research
capacity in Eswatini while simultaneously producing high-quality researchers who will successfully transition to
independence, obtain independent funding and lead national efforts to end the HIV/TB epidemic, now the leading
infectious causes of mortality globally. We have developed a training plan that has adapted to today's HIV
research priorities appropriately focused on TB specific comorbidity while being aligned with the Eswatini
National Research Strategy and priorities of the US NIH and Fogarty International Center. Building on our past
successes, we will train the next generation of HIV scientists in four essential programmatic areas including
epidemiology, biostatistics and bio-informatics, behavioral science and health promotion, and health systems
management and policy. We will develop capacity in these cornerstones of multidisciplinary clinical and
translational research by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) Capitalize on existing pediatric HIV
expertise to enhance investigation of HIV/TB co-affected children and provide long-term training to produce
Independent Emaswati Investigators in the most recent advances in the fields of epidemiology, biostatistics &
bio-informatics, behavioral science & health promotion, and health systems management & policy; 2) Provide
intensive in-country training in Child Health Applied Research Methods to well-qualified Siyakhula Scholars from
partner institutions in Eswatini; 3) Support local research infrastructure and the existing research community
while enriching the environment and capacity to support educational research opportunities for future health
professionals."

Opioid addiction is a national epidemic contributing to the deadliest drug overdose crisis in US history and
accompanied by excessive healthcare burdens due to the misuse of heroin and opioid prescription medications.
There continues to be a lack of neurobiological knowledge about opioid use disorder to drive novel therapies
critically needed to provide options to the current medications that are predominantly opioid-based and thus of
abuse liability themselves. A fundamental core of our reverse translational research efforts has been to fill critical
gaps of knowledge by direct investigation of the brains of human heroin abusers. Through such strategies we
recently discovered a previously unrecognized neurobiological impact of opioids suggesting opioid-induced
epigenetic alteration linked to the FYN which mediates glutamatergic signaling and phosphorylates tau (pTau);
we also detected significant glutamatergic alterations and hyper-pTau pathology in heroin abusers. FYN is a Src
family tyrosine kinase within the postsynaptic density that phosphorylates tau, involved in microtubule stability
and dynamics, and thus a regulator of cytoskeletal remodeling which is a key feature of addiction. We verified
elevation of FYN-targeted Tau phosphorylation in rats that self-administered heroin and in our chronic opioid in
vitro cell culture model. Moreover, we were able to inhibit heroin self-administration (SA) and seeking behaviors
in animals treated with a Fyn inhibitor and Fyn knockdown. These multidisciplinary and integrative data provides
a strong foundation on which to interrogate FYN in opioid abuse with the goal of therapeutic development. We
hypothesize that upregulation of Fyn and its resulting downstream target impairments in mesocorticolimbic brain
areas contribute to heroin addiction behavior and can be targeted for treatment interventions. We propose to (1)
determine the molecular signature of FYN-related networks in mesocorticolimbic regions associated with heroin
abuse by RNA-sequencing in a cell-specific manner in human and the rat heroin SA model and to (2) characterize
cell-specific downstream alterations mediated by Fyn underlying heroin SA and seeking behaviors. The
downstream mechanisms leverage viral mediated cell-specific effects of Fyn on intracellular signaling cascades
and pTau as well as cytoskeletal organization. Results gained from our integrative multidisciplinary study will
advance knowledge of Fyn-related abnormalities underlying opioid abuse and provide science-based
pharmacotherapeutic targets to expand treatment options for opioid addiction."

Despite the advent of aggressive cervical cancer screening programs, cervical cancer remains one of the most
common cancers affecting women under age 35, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide.
The standard of care for early stage (≥IB) cervical cancer is hysterectomy or radiation. Unfortunately, the
consequences of radical treatment include fertility loss, nerve injury causing bladder and bowel dysfunction, and
pelvic pain. There is a critical need to reduce cervical cancer mortality, while minimizing the potential morbidities
of treatment. To achieve this end requires refined approaches for diagnosis and evaluation of response to
treatment using noninvasive biomarkers to differentiate indolent from clinically significant disease at the earliest
possible time-point. PET/CT is currently the mainstay in evaluating response to treatment and is highly
confounded by post-treatment changes such as edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with advanced
diffusion-weighted imaging may offer an alternative approach to evaluate treatment response, with additional
advantages of being a radiation-free and contrast media-free exam. The overall objective in this application is to
develop and evaluate a robust advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique that provides a highly sensitive
and specific reflection of cervical cancer tumor burden and treatment response at the earliest possible time point.
Our hypothesis is that restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion imaging technique, is as
sensitive and specific as standard of care post-treatment PET/CT for evaluation of treatment efficacy of cervical
cancer and can be performed 3 months earlier than standard of care PET/CT. The aims of this proposal are 1)
Determine the RSI model for cervical cancer evaluation, 2) Develop and validate a cervical cancer classification
algorithm from multi-parametric MRI based on the Aim 1 biophysical model using established machine learning
techniques, 3) Prospectively validate RSI-MRI compared to PET/CT in evaluating response to radiation
treatment in cervical cancer patients (≥ stage IB) in a pilot study0. The main significance of this study is the
development of a radiation-free and non-contrast imaging technique for evaluating response to treatment three
months earlier than the current standard of care PET/CT. This will allow appropriate treatment earlier preventing
unnecessary progression of disease. The innovation proposed involves developing a diffusion model specific for
cervix imaging within the RSI framework based on the biophysical characteristics of healthy and malignant
cervical tissue. We will then apply this quantitative technique prospectively on a preliminary cohort of patients
before and after treatment and compare to the standard of care PET/CT imaging. At the completion of the study,
a new tool for evaluating response to treatment in cervical cancer that is contrast and radiation free will be
available. This is directly translatable to the clinical setting to benefit cervical cancer patients. Cervical cancer
patients will be better served, particularly patients not responding to treatment, as they can be directed to
appropriate treatment at an earlier time point."

Retinal vascular dysfunction leads to visual impairment and loss of vision, a phenomenon that occurs in
retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration
(AMD). Injury of the retinal endothelial cell (REC) initiates a series of pathogenetic events that ultimately lead
to accelerated progression of retinal diseases. How REC injury leads to transcriptional changes that determine
whether the retinal vascular function is restored or leads to pathological changes is not known. Sphingosine
1-phosphate (S1P), a blood-borne lipid mediator that signals via G protein-coupled S1P receptors (S1PR1-5).
The applicant’s laboratory discovered the first S1PR and worked out its functional roles in vascular barrier
maintenance, development/ maturation, anti-inflammatory processes, cell survival and endothelial/ pericyte
interactions. Although two FDA-approved S1PR-targeted drugs are efficacious in the treatment of multiple
sclerosis, retinal blistering and macular edema are dose-limiting adverse effects due to the impairment of
retinal barriers. We recently showed that S1PR signaling suppresses vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)-induced AP-1 transcription factor activity and permits Norrin/Wnt/ß-catenin-dependent REC gene
expression, thus leading to retinal REC specialization. Among the AP-1 factors, JunB protein expression is
most prominently regulated by S1PR signaling, an event needed for optimal vascular network expansion and
formation of deep retinal vascular plexus. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that REC S1PR signaling
establishes JunB transcription factor gradients and permits the REC organotypic specialization mechanisms.
In this manner, attenuated S1PR signaling axis drives poorly functional retinal vascular network and
vasoproliferative ROP. In this proposal, the first specific aim will elucidate mechanisms and consequences of
S1PR sculpting of JunB transcription factor gradients in REC. Second, how S1PR signaling in the REC
promotes organotypic specialization by enabling efficient Norrin/Wnt/ß-catenin-dependent signal transduction
and gene expression will be conducted. Specific focus will be on omega-3 fatty acid transporter (MFSD2A) and
iron transporter (TFRC). The relevance of these mechanisms in the mouse models of ROP will be addressed
in specific aim 3. These studies are anticipated to enhance our understanding of basic mechanisms of retinal
vascular development, specialization and disease in the retina and ultimately lead to approaches that tame
retinal disorders by targeting the S1P lipid signaling axis and to provide S1PR inhibitors with fewer side effects."
10756518,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor with a survival time of approximately 19
months and the 5-year survival rate is ~10%. Standard treatment for GBM consists of surgical resection, external
beam radiation therapy (XRT), and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide; however, resistance to XRT and
chemotherapy is a major clinical problem. Recent studies suggest female sex hormones play a protective role
in GBM progression. However, the utility of using estrogen as a treatment for GBM is limited due to its associated
toxicity and risks of developing new cancers. Estrogen functions are mediated by two estrogen receptor (ER)-
subtypes: ERα that functions as a tumor promoter and ERβ that functions as a tumor suppressor. Recent studies
using CRISPR KO in human GBM models have confirmed that ERβ functions as a tumor suppressor in GBM.
Nonetheless, the therapeutic potential of ERβ have not been extensively exploited. Currently available
synthetic ERβ agonists (LY and ERB041) are proven to be safe for human use; however, these are no longer in
clinical development by industry due to failure to meet clinical endpoints in non-oncological clinical studies. Low
efficacy of synthetic ERβ agonists is ascribed in part to requiring high concentrations (10-100 µM) resulting in
their cross reactivity with ERα. Therefore, the development of novel selective ERβ agonists, with higher
selectivity and high potency is needed for clinical translation. In collaboration with the Center for Innovative Drug
Discovery (CIDD) at UTSA, we have developed lead ERβ agonists that deliver higher potency and specificity
to ERβ, which we have branded as CIDD-ERβ agonists. The objective of this proposal to translate the
functional role of ERβ as a tumor suppressor into a clinical strategy utilizing novel CIDD-ERβ agonists as a new
therapeutic agent. The hypothesis is that potent ERβ specific agonists block GBM progression by promoting
growth inhibitory pathways and sensitizes them to radiation and chemotherapy. We will test this hypothesis using
three aims. In Aim 1, we will further optimize the translatability of CIDD-ERβ agonist leads by using its structure-
based design, medicinal chemistry approaches and develop CIDD-ERβ agonists with higher specificity, potency
and central nervous system (CNS) ADME properties. Further, we will determine maximum tolerated dose,
toxicology and establish PK, PD. In Aim2, we will confirm the specificity of interaction of CIDD-ERβ agonists
with ERβ using biophysical methods and confirm the effect of CIDD-ERβ agonists on ERβ genomic, non-genomic
and DNA damage response functions. In Aim3, we will test the efficacy of optimized CIDD-ERβ agonists on
glioma stem cells (GSCs), test their efficacy on tumor progression and survival using patient xenograft GBM
models and also test the efficacy in conjunction with radiation and chemotherapies. This proposal is clinically
significant as successful testing of these hypotheses will result in the development of novel ERβ agonists that
promote tumor suppression, which can be readily translated into clinical use simultaneously with current chemo
and radiation therapies, providing an additional tool for enhancing survival in GBM patients."

Toxoplasma gondii (T.gondii), the causative agent for toxoplasmosis, invades host cells through
ingestion of uncooked infected meat or contaminated water. T.gondii infects 30% of the world’s
population and the current cost of the disease in US itself is estimated to be $3B and rising.
Current treatment regimen is effective only against acute infection and has severe side effects.
Hence there is an urgent need for new drugs and drug targets. The genome of T.gondii, is
predicted to encode 108 active kinases. Kinases have been shown to be involved in every aspect
of the life cycle of T.gondii, from invasion of host cells to virulence. However, the lack of
commercially available robust kinase assays has hindered T.gondii kinome-directed drug
discovery.
In this application, we aim to develop and validate assays targeted against the kinases essential
to the T.gondii parasite’s life-cycle, which is responsible for transmission and disease pathology.
These T.gondii kinase specific assays, based on our three-hybrid split luciferase system, will be
further used for high throughput screening of a kinase targeted inhibitor library. These efforts are
both significant and innovative as the identification of target specific inhibitors will not only provide
pharmacophores for further drug development but also identify chemical probes for studying
kinase biology and signaling pathways to provide new interventions."
10908989,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sex determination pathways in animals use gene expression circuits to amplify chromosomal differences into
anatomic, neurological and behavioral distinctions between males and females. We study sex differences in
metabolism manifested as sexual dimorphism in fat storage in adipose tissues. We found dimorphic expression
of sex-determining genes in the major adipose tissue of Drosophila melanogaster, called the fat body (FB),
which is equivalent to the liver and adipose tissue in mammals. Here we investigate the underlying molecular
mechanisms and the effects on fat storage in Drosophila larvae, where males store more fat than females. Our
lab previously found that Spenito (Nito), a conserved RNA-binding protein and a subunit of the N6-
methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase complex, is required for proper fat storage regardless of sex. FB-
specific depletion of Nito abolished body fat differences between males and females, making both similarly
lean. We find that the canonical sex determination pathway, based on splicing of the master regulatory gene
Sex lethal (Sxl), is active in the FB tissue itself, and that Nito is required for this sexual dimorphism at the
molecular level. Nito is known to function in Sxl splicing by modifying Sxl RNA with m6A, but Nito depletion in
cultured cells affects twice as many gene as does depletion of other members of the methyltransferase
complex. Furthermore, we found that while FB-specific knockdown of any of three other members of the
complex also made larvae lean, the differences between the sexes were mostly preserved. We thus propose
that Nito m6A methylates fat-regulatory RNAs in the FB in a sex-specific manner to modulate their splicing
and/or abundance. We will test this hypothesis in two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the
metabolomic and transcriptomic differences between male and female FBs, as a way of pinpointing key
transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes responsible for the metabolic sexual dimorphism. Repeating this
analysis in animals with FB-specific Nito depletion will narrow the list to mRNAs regulated by Nito. Preliminary
studies identified multiple compelling candidates. To determine if the sexual dimorphism acts autonomously
within individual FB cells, or within the FB as a tissue, we will manipulate Sxl expression in male larvae either
throughout the FB or within clones of FB cells to “feminize” the entire tissue or groups of cells, respectively. We
will then assess fat storage in the “feminized” cells/tissue. Repeating this analysis when Nito is depleted will
test Nito dependence. In Aim 2, we will identify m6A-modified FB mRNAs in males versus females and see
how these m6A modifications change when Nito is depleted, compared to changes when other
methyltransferase subunits are depleted. Sexually dimorphic, Nito-dependent m6A-modified mRNAs will be
chosen for a “rescue” experiment to express the “female” version in the FB of male larvae and ask if this is able
to “feminize” FB metabolism. This work will uncover molecular mechanisms of sex differences in metabolism."
10744249,"Project summary: Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the northern
hemisphere and its incidence is steadily increasing. The ability of the Lyme disease spirochetes
to adapt to changing environmental conditions is dependent in part on regulation mediated by the
secondary messenger molecule, cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP). This proposal will identify the critical
functional determinants of PlzA, the sole identified c-di-GMP binding protein produced by all Lyme
disease spirochete isolates. Based on the recently determined atomic structure of PlzA which
revealed that PlzA belongs to the unique xPilZ domain class of c-di-GMP binding proteins and
data demonstrating that PlzA has RNA chaperone activities, we will perform a comprehensive
analysis to dissect structure-function relationships of both apo and holo forms of the protein.
Based on comparative sequence and structural analyses, surface-exposed amino acid residues
will be targeted for site-directed mutagenesis. The impact of these mutations on PlzA structure,
c-di-GMP binding, RNA winding, RNA unwinding, and protein-protein interactions will be
assessed in vitro. Based on these analyses, a series of B. burgdorferi transgenic strains in which
wild-type plzA is replaced with plzA genes that encode PlzA proteins with altered activity will be
generated. The ability of each strain to infect and transmit between ticks and mammals will be
determined. These analyses will define the functional domains and biological mechanisms by
which apo and holo PlzA regulate cellular processes required for the completion of the enzootic
cycle."
10772037,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Caspases are a group of proteases most well known for their destructive role in apoptosis. While their
activation is often equated with cell death, in skeletal muscles, this does not hold true. For example, during
myogenic differentiation, caspases are activated in a transient, regulated, and reversible manner. These
proteases can also be activated chronically in Duchenne or limb-girdle muscular dystrophies. Nevertheless, very
little is known about the non-apoptotic roles of caspases in muscle formation and degeneration. By focusing on
caspase-mediated trimming of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), this K01 project will elucidate how sublethal
caspases bring about such contrasting outcomes. Caspases can proteolyze four distal subunits of the NPC,
impair nuclear export, and entrap several NES (nuclear export signal)-containing proteins, many of which have
genome regulatory functions. In Aim 1, NES-containing proteins that accumulate in the nucleus during
myogenesis and drive genome reconfiguration will be identified in an unbiased manner. In addition, a focused
study will be conducted to understand how FAK, an NES-containing focal adhesion protein that doubles as a
transcription cofactor in the nucleus, interacts with MBD2, a methyl CpG-binding protein, to de-repress myogenic
genes. In Aim 2, caspase-mediated NPC trimming in dystrophic muscles will be assessed. Given that modest
activation of caspases by ER stressors is sufficient to cause NPC trimming and nuclear export shutdown in
myotubes, the NPC in dystrophic muscles will be similarly modified and dysfunctional. Therefore, a proteome-
wide search will be performed to identify proteins whose nuclear levels are abnormally high in dystrophic
myonuclei and have potential to induce genome dysregulation.
 In short, by dissecting the antagonistic pleiotropy of the caspase-NPC-nuclear export axis, this proposal
aims to provide a foundation for new therapeutic approaches that promote muscular health in both healthy
individuals and muscular dystrophy patients. This research combines the expertise of the Martin Hetzer lab (the
Salk Institute) in the NPC and that of the Lorenzo Puri lab (Sanford-Burnham-Prebys) in muscle biology. Dr.
Cho’s long-term goal is to lead a research group that studies nuclear proteome and proteases in the context of
myogenesis and muscular dystrophies. K01 award will provide him the stability, networking opportunity, and
confidence to develop into a young leader in the field of muscle biology who is proficient in both reductionist and
systems approaches."
10761795,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Gene replacement therapy for inherited retinal degenerations has improved visual function in animal models,
which has built momentum to curing blindness in humans. Optimal therapy is the return of normal visual function,
however, current clinical trials face challenges associated with variability and durability of recovery due to the
lack of rigorous mechanistic understanding of the retinal circuit's reaction to the therapies and any potential
hinderance to full recovery. To restore vision, it is essential to understand how surviving retinal neurons modify
synaptic connections upon vision restoration treatment and how retinal plasticity can be leveraged to improve
visual function. Our long-term goal is to elucidate fundamental mechanisms that enable the retina to establish
functional connections following gene therapy. The objectives of the proposed work are to determine underlying
mechanisms of functional recovery at cellular and circuit resolution using a mouse model of achromatopsia,
which restores selective loss of cone-mediated function after gene therapy. In Aim 1, we will determine the
recovery of spatial and temporal processing in ON and OFF pathways after gene therapy. We will measure
spatio-temporal receptive fields of specific ganglion cell types. In Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of
synaptic remodeling and transmitter release homeostasis to the structure and function of cone bipolar cells
following gene therapy. Achieving robust and sustained therapies require understanding of how gene therapy
restores rewiring and neurotransmitter release from first- and second-order synapses. Imaging and
electrophysiology will allow us to determine the wiring patterns of outer and inner retina, and how cones and
bipolar cell release rates potentially adapt to changes in inputs to reach homeostasis. The approach is innovative
for a new perspective on restoring vision in the context of the retinal plasticity investigating the effects of gene
therapy on connectivity patterns and functional properties at the single-cell level of the retinal circuit. The results
will be significant for (1) revealing whether retinal plasticity is constructive toward restoring visual function, (2)
determining mechanisms that allow the remaining retinal neurons to re-establish functional connections with
newly rescued cones, and (3) providing knowledge essential for maximizing function after photoreceptor
recovery."
10881719,"The short-term effects of extreme weather such as hurricanes on cardiovascular disease (CVD) are well-docu-
mented. However, the long-term CVD effects are unknown, likely leading to adverse outcomes, particularly for
older, low socioeconomic status (SES), and functionally impaired residents, whose limited resources often
mean staying in place. After Hurricane Katrina, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched
the emPOWER Program to identify community-based, high-risk, functionally impaired Medicare beneficiaries
who rely on essential medical services and durable medical equipment in order to improve pre-disaster evacu-
ation planning and post-disaster management. One potentially significant limitation for both the general and
high-risk emPOWER population is that their estimated disaster-related needs are based on short-term out-
comes since we lack knowledge about longer-term consequences. The objective of this study is to receive
mentored training to quantify the long-term adverse CVD outcomes associated with hurricanes. I hypothesize
that the short-term worsening of CVD outcomes endures beyond the first year, with higher rates occurring in
vulnerable groups that are yet to be rigorously defined. I will evaluate Hurricane Sandy’s impact on New York
City (NYC) in 2012 because of the substantial physical damage wrought, its large population and neighbor-
hood-level SES disparities, and the fact that no further hurricanes affected NYC. Building on disaster-related
clinical expertise and research skills as a physician-scientist trained in health services research, I will learn and
apply new spatial, epidemiological, and machine learning analytical skills to accomplish the following aims: 1)
estimate the hurricane’s impact on the ≥ 65 years old population over the short- (1 year) and long-term (5
years) on census tract-level CVD prevalence using spatiotemporal modeling; 2) compare the hurricane’s short-
and long-term impact on CVD event rates for current high-risk Medicare beneficiaries (emPOWER) compared
to all other beneficiaries ≥ 65 years old using survival analyses and Cox models; and 3) develop and validate a
CVD risk prediction tool that expands the definition of high-risk Medicare beneficiaries impacted by hurricanes
beyond emPOWER using machine learning and risk prediction methods. In a future R01 application, I will ex-
ternally validate the risk prediction model using 100% Medicare claims from the 2017 hurricane season (the
costliest in US history). Together, this work will allow public health authorities to better tailor pre-disaster evac-
uation and post-disaster CVD management that address disaster-related morbidity for high-risk groups into the
longer term. I will be mentored and advised by a team of nationally recognized experts: Dr. Martin Shapiro (ca-
reer mentor), Dr. Monika Safford (CVD and social epidemiology), Dr. David Abramson (disaster science and
policy), Dr. Charles DiMaggio (spatial analysis), and Dr. Samprit Banerjee (machine learning and risk predic-
tion). This Award will enable me to advance my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist
whose focus lies at the intersection of CVD, climate change, and health equity.

10816617,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is the leading cause of death due to infection
and many TB survivors are left with permanent lung impairment due to immune-mediated cavitation and fibrotic
healing. Sirtuins (SIRTs) are a family of energy-sensing NAD+-dependent deacetylases that modify histones,
transcription factors, metabolic enzymes, and other targets to defend starvation, restore homeostasis during
stress, support mitochondrial integrity, and promote the resolution of inflammation. In published and unpublished
preliminary studies, we found that levels of SIRT1 (the major cytosolic SIRT) and SIRT3 (the major mitochondrial
SIRT) are downregulated in macrophages (MΦ) infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Preliminary
data support a model in which SIRT1/3 axis suppression by Mtb in MΦ alters the expression levels of genes in
the tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transport chain, and glycolytic pathway. This causes a shift from oxidative
phosphorylation to glycolysis, increases production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and impairs
ROS scavenging. The result is increased mitochondrial stress and MΦ cell death. The glycolytic shift (Warburg
effect) rapidly enhances MΦ antimicrobial performance but at the expense of perturbing multiple SIRT1/3
regulated processes that lead to increased inflammation and TB disease severity with chronic infection. Studies
in Aim 1 build on and fill gaps in our preliminary data, with in vitro experiments investigating the mechanism of
SIRT1/3 downregulation by Mtb and the downstream effects on metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming. Aim
2 uses existing strains of SIRT1 and SIRT3 null mice, and other strains in development, for aerosol TB studies
that will relate in vitro data from Aim1 to host defense at the systemic level in vivo. The project culminates with
testing of several SIRT agonists for host-directed therapy of TB. We predict that these agents will restore
mitochondrial homeostasis, hasten lesion sterilization, and reduce pulmonary TB immune pathology. The effects
of these agents on immunometabolic pathways in vivo will be interpreted in the context of in vitro data produced
in Aim 1. Our project addresses an important gap in understanding the upstream triggers and downstream
consequences of the Warburg effect in TB while at the same time producing new knowledge about potential
adjunctive treatments to improve TB treatment outcomes and reduce the burden of pulmonary impairment in TB
survivors."
10789991,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
One of the most intriguing and understudied aspects of male reproductive physiology is the ability of the epididymis to
prevent the development of immune responses against autoantigenic spermatozoa, while initiating very efficient immune
responses against pathogens. The long-term goal of this application is to develop new strategic therapies for common
disorders such as male infertility and epididymitis, and to identify novel targets for male-contraception. The overall
objective is to elucidate how epididymal epithelial clear cells (CCs) communicate with immunocytes to contribute to the
“immune privileged” environment that is optimal for sperm maturation and storage. We have recently showed a
completely novel role for CCs in immune activation and sperm tolerance. Importantly, these cells establish intimate
contact with region-specific heterogeneous subsets of mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) in the epididymis. Our central
hypothesis is that CCs are strategically positioned to work in a concerted manner with immune cells to survey the
epididymis barrier and regulate the balance between inflammation and immune tolerance in the post-testicular
environment. The rationale is based on our preliminary data showing that CCs and MPs communicate in the steady state
epididymis and also in the presence of infection or injury, and that both cell types express different tolerogenic mediators
allowing the modulation of sperm tolerance. Therefore, these cells play a central role in the epididymal mucosa. In the
first specific aim, we will determine CC – MP communication networks that initiate immune activation during epididymitis.
In this aim, two mouse models of epididymitis will be used: injection of bacterial antigens into the cauda lumen, and
epididymal-testicular torsion that induces sterile inflammation. In the second specific aim, we will evaluate CC - MP
crosstalk after ablation of sperm tolerance in the epididymis, induced by depletion of regulatory T cells using diphtheria
toxin-based transgenic mice. The research proposed in this application will use an innovative multidisciplinary approach
that employs powerful immunology techniques rarely used to study reproductive physiology, 3D confocal microscopy,
transcriptomics analysis, flow cytometry, cell sorting and bioinformatic analysis, as well as the use of mouse models to
describe how specialized epithelial cells and immunocytes communicate in the epididymis. Notably, we will provide an in-
depth characterization of three specific epididymal cell types: CCs and two subsets of MPs. Our proposed research is
significant because it is expected to provide new insights into major immunoregulatory mechanisms by which epididymal
CCs together with MPs protect spermatozoa against harmful antigens and autoimmunity. Ultimately, such knowledge will
fill important gaps related to male reproductive biology by addressing crucial concepts of mucosal immunology and cell–
cell interactions, all of which are critical but understudied facets of human male reproductive health."

careers. We recruit and train talented students from majority, underrepresented minority, disabled, and
disadvantaged populations. Trainees admitted to our program have outstanding academic records and strong
motivation and aptitude to pursue research. A key feature of our program is an intensive, focused curriculum
required of all first-year students. Students work together in lecture and discussion-style courses taught by
dedicated faculty to master a fundamental set of approaches that underpin molecular biological science. The
training program exposes students to the research interests of all faculty members in the Biology Department
prior to a sequence of rotations that, in combination with first-semester courses, support an informed choice
of a thesis advisor and topic. Students gain experience in scientific communication and in teaching and
mentoring junior students. Responsible conduct of research is taught in both classroom and laboratory
settings, including an intense mini-course for 2nd year students. Students have many opportunities to learn
about career paths open to them following doctoral training. Students’ progress through the program is
monitored in regular thesis committee meetings with faculty members, with oversight by the graduate
committee. We seek to build and maintain a welcoming and supportive community in which all students are
valued and included. This training grant would constitute a critical source of support for ~50% of training-grant
eligible graduate students in our program during their first two years. Our students perform research of
outstanding quality, and most trainees go on to careers in biomedical research. Many of our former trainees
are now leaders in their chosen fields and bring to their positions the knowledge, rigor, thoughtful
perspectives, and values of equity and inclusion that we emphasize at MIT Biology. We anticipate exciting
futures for our alumni as they help transform the US biomedical landscape."

Transcription hubs are hotspots in the genome with elevated transcription activities.
Concentrating proteins and nucleic acids, transcription hubs are essential for cells to transcribe
genes important for cell identity and cell type-specific functions, while their dysregulation leads to
many diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer. Although there is growing interest in
understanding transcription hubs, a lot remains unknown. The goal of our research is to address
two fundamental questions about transcription hubs, using advanced imaging and proteomics
techniques. The first of these questions is: how are transcription hubs formed? Transcription
hubs appear as distinct foci in the nucleus, and it is hypothesized that liquid-liquid phase
separation is responsible for transcription hubs formation. We will use Yes-associated Protein
(YAP) transcription hub, an ideal system established in my postdoctoral work to understand how
transcription hubs form. YAP is a transcription coactivator activating genes important in cell
proliferation and survival. After hyperosmotic stress, an inducible signal to activate YAP target
gene transcription, we have found that YAP forms hubs with different components over time,
coincident with their different functions (clustering accessible chromatins first, and activating
transcription second). We will use candidate and unbiased approaches to identify protein
components of YAP hubs with live-cell imaging, and then test the effect of modulating these
proteins in accessible chromatin organization and transcription activation. We will also use single
particle tracking to probe the biophysical nature of YAP transcription hubs, to understand if they
form by phase separation or alternative mechanisms. The second question regarding transcription
hubs is: how do transcription hubs activate transcription? We hypothesize that transcription hub
can mediate enhancer-promoter interaction to activate transcription. We will use multicolor live-
cell imaging to visualize localization of enhancer and promoter of Myc (a target gene of YAP), and
see how their relative position to YAP transcription hub lead to Myc transcription activation.
Together, these studies will elucidate molecular mechanisms of transcription hub formation and
function. A better understanding of these mechanisms will have implications for the formation and
function of other transcription hubs, and shed light on mechanisms of diseases of impaired
transcription hub formation."

these laboratories, their collaborative interactions, and the commitment of the trainers to support
of the Training Program is evidence of the collegial scientific environment within the Training
Program. Finally, to ensure that each of the trainees comes to understand the clinical aspects
of their area of investigation, each selects a Clinical Co-Mentor who helps organize an individual
clinical experience. Through this experience trainees are introduced to patient diagnosis and
treatment on a first hand basis. The Clinical Co-Mentor remains on the student’s thesis
committee through graduation. In addition, the Program has been at the forefront in including
program evaluation, responsible conduct of research training, rigor and reproducibility training,
sexual harassment awareness, individual development plans, and career/professional
development seminars that provide information about diverse career pathways. This proposal
seeks funding for 6 trainees within the Training Program. This Training Program has gained
national recognition and has had excellent outcomes. Since our first class matriculated in 2007
there has been a total of 55 PhD graduates with an average time to degree of 5.38 years. Our

10829898,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC) is crucial, considering the
debilitating and life-threatening nature of this sleep disorder and its high prevalence. Previous studies have
established that the loss of orexins is the fundamental cause of NC in humans and animals. However, the role
of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons, which are reciprocally connected with orexin neurons and
play a complementary role in sleep-wake regulation, in the pathophysiology of NC remains unclear. The
proposed work is aimed to address this question and to define the neural circuitry through which MCH neurons
may influence cataplexy. To understand if MCH neurons are active during cataplexy, in Aim1, we will image
activity dynamics of MCH neurons in a mouse model of NC during spontaneous cataplexy as well as in the
presence of positive emotional stimuli that enhance cataplexy. To demonstrate a causal role of MCH neurons
in cataplexy, in Aim 2, we will selectively activate and silence the MCH neurons using chemogenetic methods
and study the changes in spontaneous cataplexy and positive-emotion-triggered cataplexy (PES-cataplexy).
As MCH neurons heavily project to the midbrain locomotor region (MLR; involved in facilitating muscle tone
and locomotor activity), whose lesions in rats produced cataplexy, we then hypothesized that the MCH neurons
might target the MLR to modulate cataplexy. We will test this hypothesis, in Aim 3, by studying the changes in
cataplexy a) following in vivo optogenetic stimulation of the MCH terminals in the MLR with concurrent
chemogenetic inhibition of MCH soma and b) following optogenetic inhibition of the MCH terminals in the MLR
with concurrent chemogenetic activation of MCH soma. Finally, in Aim 4, to identify the neurochemically
distinct subset(s) of MLR neurons involved in MCH control of cataplexy, we will chemogenetically activate or
inhibit the glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the MLR in mice with or without orexins and study
cataplexy behavior. Collectively, these experiments will identify the specific mechanisms and pathways by
which MCH neurons influence cataplexy and thereby will improve our understanding of the neural basis of NC."
10805399,"The objective unifying our two areas of NIGMS-funded research is to identify molecular mechanisms underlying
microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions involving D. pigrum and nasal Corynebacterium species that
shape the human nasal microbiota. Evidence indicates that Corynebacterium species and Dolosigranulum
pigrum play key roles in structuring a nasal microbiota beneficial to human health. For example, people with high
levels of Corynebacterium and/or D. pigrum in their nasal microbiota are less likely to be colonized by pathobionts
and, therefore, are at lower risk of invasive infections in other parts of their bodies. Similarly, nasal microbiota
dominated by Corynebacterium/D. pigrum are often associated with health rather than with diseases such as
otitis media and pneumonia. Our overarching hypothesis is that interactions between D. pigrum and
Corynebacterium species drive a beneficial health-promoting human nasal microbiota. A central goal of this
research is to shift from correlations in compositional data to causation by identifying molecular mechanisms that
underlie both in vivo associations and in vitro phenotypes. Our NIGMS-supported preliminary data show that
there are four common species of nasal Corynebacterium. Three of these are positively correlated with D. pigrum
and enhance D. pigrum growth in vitro. Furthermore, cocultivation of D. pigrum with Corynebacterium
pseudodiphtheriticum together robustly inhibits S. pneumoniae in vitro, compared to either alone. D. pigrum also
inhibits S. aureus growth in vitro. These in vitro results support a role for in vivo interactions with potential health
benefits. To understand microbe-microbe and microbe-epithelium interactions in the human nasal passages, we
will use human nasal epithelial organoids at an air-liquid interface (aka nasanoids) as an innovative biomimetic
model system in collaboration with our Organoid Core. Microbial communities are characterized by a network of
metabolic interactions among microbes and with the environment. Genomic analysis uncovered D. pigrum
auxotrophies indicating it depends on the host or microbial neighbors for key nutrients. Our research will address
gaps in understanding the food web that supports human nasal microbiota; the effects on the epithelium of
hosting microbes; and the physiology and function of potentially beneficial nasal bacteria. A key advantage of
using human nasal microbiota to identify metabolic interactions is that it is a self-contained bacterial-epithelial
system with regard to nutrients. We will use complementary approaches including pan-genomics, metabolic
modeling, dual bacteria-epithelium transcriptomics, metabolomics and genetic engineering. We will also tackle
key technical challenges in the nasal microbiome field to facilitate identification of metabolites, proteins and
genes involved in interactions. To advance research on D. pigrum and nasal Corynebacterium, we have
established a large culture collection of nasal bacteria from > 400 volunteers of all ages. By identifying metabolic
interactions between nasal Corynebacterium species, D. pigrum, and the nasal epithelium that sculpt a health-
promoting human nasal microbiota, we hope to catalyze new approaches for preventing infection."
10809759,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The ability of patients with cochlear-implants (CI) to discriminate speech sounds is the fundamental
measure of efficacy that clinicians use to create personalized clinical interventions. Given the universal
importance of early identification and treatment for children born with hearing loss, the most appropriate clinical
intervention for children with CIs should be initiated at the earliest possible age. Despite the routine
implantation of prelingually-deaf infants as young as 9-months-old, there are currently no established clinical
measures of CI efficacy for children younger than approximately 4-years-old. The long-term goal of the
proposed research is to develop new measures of device efficacy in cochlear-implanted infants that can be
used to drive clinical decisions at a much earlier age than is currently possible.
 The ability to perceive patterns of temporal or spectral intensity modulation in a noise, or “acoustic
modulation perception”, is known to predict speech understanding in adult CI users. In previous work, the PI
adapted tests of acoustic modulation perception for testing infants and young children. The next step,
proposed in this application, will be to investigate how acoustic modulation perception develops, and relates to
speech perception, in implanted infants. This will involve examining the development of two independent
factors with markedly different trajectories: the ability to resolve the spectral place or timing of modulation, and
sensitivity to intensity modulation across frequency or time. The central hypothesis is that both normal hearing
and implanted infants will show an asymmetry in development of these factors. Frequency and temporal
resolution is expected to mature by 6-months postnatal hearing-age whereas sensitivity to intensity modulation
is expected to remain immature through 7-10 years old. The basis for this hypothesis is that frequency and
temporal resolution reflect early-developing peripheral auditory mechanisms whereas sensitivity to intensity
modulation reflects later-developing central auditory mechanisms.
 There are 3 specific aims to this proposal. The first is to characterize the developmental trajectory for
frequency and temporal resolution in implanted and normal hearing infants during the first 6 months of post-
natal hearing experience. The second is to compare the developmental trajectory of spectral and temporal
modulation sensitivity in children implanted during infancy with that of normal hearing children through 10-
years-of-age. The third is to determine if frequency and temporal resolution independently predict speech
perception outcomes in implanted children. This work is a necessary step toward the goal of developing age-
appropriate, nonlinguistic measures of acoustic modulation perception that reflect CI efficacy in implanted
infants. If the long-term goal of the proposed research is realized, the positive impact will be to enable earlier,
more effective, clinical interventions for young patients who use CIs."

Heart failure (HF), and its subtypes defined by preserved (HFpEF), reduced (HFrEF) or mid-range (HFmrEF)
ejection fraction are a major and growing public health problem. The long term goal of this project is to better
understand the health disparities regarding HF and define effective preventive measures that may reduce
these disparities. We propose to pool data from 10 large longitudinal cohort studies to examine race/ethnic
and sex disparities in developing HF, its subtypes, and its prognosis. The harmonized data will include over
130,028 men and women with over 8975 similarly-adjudicated prospective HF outcomes, representing a wide
spectrum of ages, race/ethnicities, and geographic regions of the United States. This cross-cohort
collaboration will provide a unique opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of sex and racial/ethnic
health disparities in HF. Causal mediation analysis techniques will be used to estimate the degree to which
single and multi-factor lifestyle and clinical interventions could potentially reduce health disparities in HF. In our
phenomapping aim, we will define unique clinically relevant phenotypes of HF based upon cohort data that is
also commonly present in medical records for enhanced generalizability, including age, race/ethnicity, sex,
clinical signs, symptoms, biomarkers, ejection fraction, physiologic measures, and co-morbidities; we will also
evaluate HF phenotype associations with CVD and all-cause mortality."

10837751,"PROJECT 1 – ABSTRACT
Immunization during pregnancy is an effective intervention for protection of both mothers and their infants prior
to infant’s routine vaccination. Tetanus, B. pertussis and seasonal influenza vaccines are administered to
pregnant women and offspring benefit from vaccine-induced antibodies which are transferred during gestation
via placenta and postnatally via breast milk. Vaccines given to pregnant women, however, have not been
designed for this specific group, but are targeted for and tested in the non-pregnant healthy adults. A profound
immune modulation takes place during gestation, which is expected to influence responses to vaccines. Our
preliminary data revealed differentially glycosylated vaccine-specific serum IgG subtypes in pregnant women
following seasonal flu vaccination with an increase in di-galactosylation indicative of non-inflammatory state.
Antibodies produced by pregnant women also diverged in avidity and function.
MADI Project 1 will investigate biophysical and functional features of humoral immunity as well antigen-specific
B and T cell responses to vaccines [Tetanus, Diphtheria and acellular Pertussis (TdaP) and influenza]
administered to pregnant women and non-pregnant controls. Three aims are proposed to:
Aim 1 – Investigate the impact of pregnancy on humoral, B and T cell responses to vaccines. We will
determine the dynamic profile of Ab glycosylation, and Fab- and Fc-mediated anti-microbial activity during
pregnancy and up to 6 months post-delivery applying traditional assays as well as the innovative systems
serology platform We will also interrogate kinetics of vaccine-specific B and T cell responses and their
association with antibody modifications.
Aim 2 – Identify distinct features of vaccine-induced Ab in breast milk. Antibody glycan profile and function
will be examined longitudinally in breast milk from Tdap and influenza-vaccinated mothers. Features of Ab in
breast milk will be compared with those of with Ab in circulation.
Aim 3 – Determine in vivo attributes of vaccine-specific maternal Ab. Mechanistic experiments involving
mouse adoptive transfer of differentially glycosylated antibodies will be conducted to ascertain the impact of
pregnancy-associated glycan modifications on antibody longevity and protective capacity of antibodies in vivo.
Such detailed characterization of humoral and cellular response evolution and mechanistic interrogation of
function during and after pregnancy has not been conducted. Understanding the impact of pregnancy on vaccine
responses will inform the development of effective vaccines to improve the health of mother and child."
10837755,"PROJECT 2 - ABSTRACT
 This project proposes to better understand the mechanisms governing, and advance our ability to
rationally control maternal-fetal antibody transport. By comparing the profiles of antibodies from milk and from
blood samples during pregnancy and umbilical cord blood samples after birth using high-throughput proteomic
tools such as NextGen sequencing of the maternal B cell repertoire and high-resolution proteomic analysis by
mass spectrometry, IgG glycoprofiling, Fc receptor affinity characterization, and Ig isotyping and subclassing,
we will define phenotypic biases in global and antigen/ vaccine-specific Ab repertoires transferred to the fetus
in vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnancies, and quantify the degree of similarity of the antibody repertoire
between mother and child. In vivo evaluation of the relationship between antibody half-life and placental
transport in animal models using natural and engineered IgG variants will define the extent of linkage between
different biological roles of FcRn, and evaluation of existing and engineering of novel IgG Fc variants for
enhanced placental transport in the ex vivo human placenta model will be employed to identify Abs with altered
transport phenotypes. Our overarching hypotheses are that among natural and engineered antibody molecules
there exist intrinsic biases for certain antibody molecules to transport across placenta more and less efficiently.
Discovery and knowledge of these biases will contribute to development of vaccine and therapeutic antibody
strategies with increased or decreased transport efficiency that are designed to improve health outcomes for
mothers and the fetus/neonate during this critical period of immunological development."
10816494,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol consumption is an important modifiable lifestyle risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Advances
in high-throughput technologies have made it possible to measure and analyze a variety of ‘omics’, that is, DNA
methylation (methylome), gene expression (transcriptome), protein (proteome) and metabolite (metabolome), in
relation to alcohol consumption and CVD in a cost-efficient manner. In this grant proposal, we will test the
hypothesis that alcohol consumption alters multiple molecular processes across different “omics” dimensions
and these molecular intermediates mediate alcohol’s effects on CVD.
To test this hypothesis, we will assemble a multidisciplinary team to test five Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will first
identify alcohol-associated transcriptomic markers. We will then examine the associations of alcohol-associated
transcriptomic markers with incident CVD (fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke), and
test whether these transcriptomic markers mediate the effect of alcohol intake on incident CVD. We will construct
polygenic risk scores to examine the potential causal relationships between alcohol intake, transcriptomic
markers, and incident CVD. We will also conduct a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to further
test and quantify the causal relationships. In Aims 2 and 3, we will identify alcohol-associated proteomic (Aim 2)
and metabolomic (Aim 3) markers and will test the relationship between alcohol, omics markers and CVD using
similar methods outlined in Aim 1. Many alcohol-associated DNA methylation markers have been identified by
our prior study in >13,000 participants. Therefore, in Aim 4, we will examine the relations of alcohol-associated
DNA methylation markers with incident CVD using similar methods outlined in Aim 1. In Aim 5, we will integrate
alcohol-associated multi-omics markers to identify key pathways and multi-omics modules associated with
alcohol intake and CVD. We will perform Random Forest analysis to identify additional alcohol-associated multi-
omics markers. We will also perform network analyses to identify modules of alcohol-associated multi-omics
markers. We will examine the relationships between these identified multi-omics markers with incident CVD, and
will functionally annotate these markers using bioinformatics tools (e.g., ENCODE, GTEx, Human Metabolome
Database, and UniProt). With the completion of this project, we will highlight the novel molecular targets for both
alcohol-associated CVD risk prevention and treatment. In addition, we will generate a multi-omics biomarker
database of alcohol intake with tailored software to facilitate the future investigations of alcohol’s relations with
other non-communicable diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases."
10893323,"Periodontitis is an infection of the tooth-supporting structures elicited by dysbiotic biofilms and a common cause
of tooth loss in adults. Its prevalence increases significantly with age and is particularly elevated in minority and
disadvantaged populations. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that periodontitis is associated with Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD), but open questions remain regarding the role of periodontitis as
part of a potential causative pathway for ADRD, and the mechanisms linking the two conditions.
In this proposal, we intend to further test the hypothesis that periodontitis is an unrecognized risk factor for
incident cognitive impairment among the participants in the WHICAP Ancillary Study of Oral Health (R56
DE022568). WHICAP is a multi-ethnic longitudinal cohort of aging elderly residing in northern Manhattan. Since
its inception nearly 30 years ago, more than 5,000 participants have been serially assessed in 24-month intervals
with medical, social, and health behavior histories, general medical exams, and neuropsychological testing.
Analyses of WHICAP data have markedly increased our knowledge of the complex influence of
sociodemographics, genetics, health behavior and lifestyle, education, literacy, and vascular disease in the
expression of incident AD and cognitive decline. In addition to these measures, current WHICAP participants
are also being assessed for multiple AD biomarkers including multimodal MRI for neurodegeneration and plasma
biomarkers for AD including amyloid and phospho-tau.
We aim to assess approximately 750 participants of the Ancillary Study of Oral Health who are still followed up
to (i) a repeat periodontal examination, encompassing clinical and microbiological measures of periodontitis
(including 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing of periodontal plaque samples), and (ii) an assessment of
peripheral monocyte profiles and levels of systemic inflammation, to examine the effect of periodontitis on
incident ADRD over an 8-year period, and to identify mechanistic associations between the two conditions.
Incorporating comprehensive, longitudinal assessments of periodontal infection within the WHICAP study
provides a unique opportunity to efficiently examine how periodontitis associates with clinical measures of
incident AD/ADRD (including neurologic and neuropsychological examinations) as well as with imaging and
plasma biomarker evidence of both diseases. Given the substantial unexplained variance in AD and dementia
in the elderly population and the fact that periodontitis is both preventable and treatable, identification of
periodontitis as a potential unrecognized risk factor for cognitive impairment has significant public health
implications."

Infectious diseases remain the leading cause of death of children worldwide. New therapeutics are urgently
needed to replace current treatments that are being compromised by drug resistance and emerging threats.
The current COVID-19 pandemic perfectly illustrates the urgency. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital
(SJCRH) is the ideal pediatric research and treatment center to train postdoctoral fellows in this effort. The
hospital’s translational and collaborative research environment combined with its expertise and infrastructure
have a proven track record of successful therapeutic development. Our pediatric patients, particularly those
treated for cancer, are typically immunocompromised and are at risk from a wide variety of infectious agents
and pathogens that evolve more rapidly without immune clearance. SJCRH has developed an internationally
recognized infectious disease program that dates from its establishment over 50 years ago. This program
includes major research efforts in therapeutic and prophylactic strategies for bacterial, viral and fungal
infectious agents. The training program leverages these strengths and the strong history of developing new
therapeutics to provide unique and enhanced research training to postdoctoral fellows. The 16 preceptors in
the program are from the departments of Infectious Diseases, Structural Biology, Chemical Biology &
Therapeutics, Immunology and Pharmaceutical Sciences. They bring complementary expertise to this
enterprise that not only seeks to understand the biology of infection but also strives to develop therapies to
combat them. This expertise includes drug discovery, high-throughput screening, medicinal chemistry,
immune responses to infection and therapies, and vaccine platforms and adjuvants. These efforts are linked to
on-site best in class capabilities in GMP manufacturing and clinical trials. The broad goals of the program
are to characterize pathogenic mechanisms, identify targets for therapeutic intervention, and develop
vaccines and lead drug compounds that progress through the state-of-the-art therapeutics
development infrastructure into safe and effective medicines. Collaborations between the preceptors
provide a cross-disciplinary approach to the training program. In addition, 4 clinical collaborators will provide
training in patient care, clinical trials and international medicine, and 5 training collaborators will provide
training in specialized techniques. All trainees will be instructed in grant writing, rigor and reproducibility, ethics
and mentoring. Interactions with pharmaceutical companies and visits to international sites in conjunction with
the SJCRH Global Program are integral parts of the curriculum. To promote independence, trainees will
develop their own research projects guided by a ‘team’ of mentors and apply for independent funding. We
request support for three postdoctoral trainees, and the program will continue its efforts to recruit URM trainees
by providing institutional support for an additional URM trainee. Finally, a formal evaluation process led by an
External Advisory Committee has been established to track success and identify areas for improvement."

Adipose tissue is complex and heterogenous, containing numerous structures and cell types
besides adipocytes. This includes lymphatic vessels, which return interstitial fluid, solutes, and
immune cells back to circulation. There is a well-documented but unexplained bidirectional
relationship between adipocytes and lymphatic vessels, such that poor lymphatic function leads
to increased adiposity. Conversely, obesity results in impaired lymphatic flow. The molecular
basis for these interactions is unknown. Our single cell RNA sequencing data from mouse and
human adipose tissue revealed that lymphatic endothelial cells express the neuropeptide
neurotensin (NTS). We show that NTS is a potent anti-thermogenic agent, and its expression is
suppressed by cold temperatures. Here we will characterize the mechanisms regulating NTS
expression and processing, and we will utilize state of the art techniques to document the effects
of losing NTS in lymphatic vessels or its receptor on adipocytes. These studies will help explain
the puzzling relationship between fat and the lymphatic system, and will also lead to new insights
into control of adipose physiology and metabolism by neuropeptides."

Over the next five years, my laboratory aims to study time-resolved systemic inflammation across multiple
chronic diseases. Though pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling is common amongst chronic diseases, it is unclear
what cytokines are active at various timepoints throughout disease initiation and progression. It is also unclear
what cytokines are functional in the inflection from acute to chronic-phase inflammatory signaling. Current
methods of research evaluation are not amenable to rapid kinetics (enzymatic immunoassays) or quantitative
multiplexing (molecular imaging techniques). We plan to use a fluorescent carbon nanosensor-based platform I

multiplexed cytokine nanosensor will be encapsulated within an injectable hydrogel matrix for minimally-invasive
implantation and rapid measurement. We will use this sensor platform to create a cytokine signal detection
network for both circulating and in situ cytokine signals in rodent models of chronic diseases. The nanosensor
network will initially be validated in healthy mice using exogenous cytokine injection. We will ensure the sensor
detects multiple cytokines simultaneously, at disease-relevant concentrations, is functional for months, and
exhibits no specificity issues. The encapsulating hydrogel matrix will be designed to allow passage of proteins
but retention of the sensor based on size, and will undergo minimal biofouling. Following technology validation,
we will use the nanosensor network to measure local and circulating cytokine levels in at least eight models of
chronic disease, including: cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and autoimmune
disease. Future work will be extended to infectious disease, chronic renal disease, musculoskeletal disease, and
others. In each disease model, we will couple traditional assessments of inflammation and immune response,
as evaluated by weekly blood draws coupled with enzymatic immunoassays. Local inflammation will also be
evaluated at the time of sacrifice via single-cell transcriptomic sequencing and immunohistochemical staining.
Kinetic cytokine measurements will be obtained via the nanosensor network, deployed in at least 7 locations in
each animal, 2 local and 2 systemic, via hydrogel injection. Each will be measured daily for kinetic cytokine
quantification prior to and immediately after disease initiation, during chronic progression, and during end-stage
disease. Sensor measurement will be performed via whole-animal imaging and simple 3-second light excitation
non-invasively from outside the animal. These sensors will provide real-time, long-term quantification of cytokine
concentrations throughout disease progression. We expect to understand kinetic cytokine changes in the
inflection from acute to chronic inflammatory responses and the pro-inflammatory contribution of multiple organs
during disease development. We will investigate pro-inflammatory cytokine signatures for each disease at
specific times in its development, providing scientists studying each field difficult-to-obtain dynamic data and

of progressive SIV infection), this efficacy is of an entirely new pattern – early SIV replication arrest followed by
eventual viral clearance – and is mediated by a novel immune response – MHC-E-restricted, effector memory-
differentiated CD8+ T cells (which to date can only be elicited by CMV vectors with specific genetic programming).
We also know that the efficacy of MHC-E targeted CD8+ T cell responses is predicted by a whole blood
transcriptomic signature featuring IL-15 signaling, but the mechanisms responsible for complete arrest and
subsequent clearance of nascent SIV infection are not defined, including the questions of why MHC-E-restricted
epitope recognition is required for efficacy, how these cells mediate replication arrest, and how the protective
whole blood transcriptomic signature influences these unique effector responses. In this program, we seek to
both answer these questions and develop detailed criteria for “replication arrest” efficacy for guiding ongoing
phase I/II clinical testing of human CMV/HIV vaccines. The proposed program will include the following 3
projects: 1) Immunologic and virologic characterization of RhCMV/SIV vaccine-mediated SIV “replication arrest”
efficacy, 2) Characterization of the in vivo T cell (and overall immune) interception of primary SIV infection after
vaccination with differentially response programmed RhCMV/SIV vectors (MHC-E- vs. MHC-II- vs. MHC-Ia-
restricted) and a conventional prime-boost SIV vaccine (MHC-Ia-restricted), and 3) Determination of the minimal
MHC-E-restricted SIV epitope targeting required for RhCMV/SIV vaccine-mediated SIV “replication arrest”
efficacy. These projects will be supported by 4 cores: A) Administration, B) NHP, C) Advanced Spatial Analysis,
and D) `Omics, Bioinformatics, and Data Management. In addition to guiding current and future clinical testing of
HMCV/HIV vaccines, the understanding the immunologic basis of “SIV replication arrest” efficacy and the role of
MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cells in this process will have broad implications for HIV cure approaches, as well as
inform the use of MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cells as universal (MHC haplotype independent) effectors for
immunotherapies directed at other infectious diseases or cancer."
10873011,"The Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology and Biophysics (CMDB) graduate program is an independent,
stand-alone biomedical training program at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) that spans five basic science
departments and the Carnegie Institution, all on the Arts and Sciences Homewood campus. It has been funded
by a single T32 grant currently completing its 46th year. The program seeks to produce independent biomedical
scientists through rigorous training and wide-ranging experiences wherein they acquire robust, transferable skills
in quantitative biology, science communication, teaching, mentoring, and community outreach.
 The CMDB training philosophy features two core components. The first is a commitment to a broad but
integrated training experience. Our interdisciplinary training faculty embody a breadth of research interests that
span quantitative biophysics and biochemistry, developmental genetics, and modern cellular and molecular
biology. Recent faculty hires introduced new areas of computational biology and genomics, further bolstering
cross-disciplinary interactions, yet we remain a cohesive community, integrated via shared courses, seminars,
and collaborations. Students gain broad scientific, technical skills in all disciplines through a core curriculum and
four rotations before specializing in their thesis research. Instruction and promotion of responsible research
conduct is integral to the entire training. The philosophy’s second component represents forming a complete
scientist. This involves more than excellence in the laboratory: We train researchers to be effective
communicators, educators, and leaders and support their outreach efforts. To that end, we expanded our training
to include development of scientific communication and teaching skills, and our students participate in scientific
outreach locally and nationally. Via in-program initiatives and JHU resources, our students explore careers
extending beyond academic research. Recruitment efforts have led to one of the most diverse JHU graduate
programs. On average, 17 TGE students matriculate into CMDB, and they will be supported by the T32 for their
1st year with stipend and tuition supplements provided by JHU. In 2017, we launched a survey-based initiative
to assess the program’s effectiveness. The CMDB portal contains these data, providing transparent information
to current and prospective students. This information guides the program—we foster innovation through data-
driven decisions on faculty mentor training, student assessment, flexible career opportunities, and student
retention.
 This application details the program’s gains and our plans to move forward with a philosophy that has
already produced great success—dedication to broad, interdisciplinary scientific training, an emphasis on
forming scientists who are outstanding communicators and educators and who give back to their communities,
and a mission to recruit, nurture, and promote excellence in the next generation of biomedical researchers."

The clinical gold-standard method for interrogating tissue specimens, slide-based (2D) histopathology, is based
on centuries-old technologies with many inherent limitations. Recent technological advances have demonstrated
the feasibility of achieving high-throughput slide-free 3D histology of biopsy and surgical specimens. In
comparison to conventional slide-based histology, nondestructive 3D histology has the potential to provide a
transformative improvement in diagnostic pathology performance for a number of reasons: (1) vastly greater
(>100X) sampling of tissue specimens, (2) volumetric imaging of 3D cell distributions and tissue structures that
are prognostic and predictive, (3) nondestructive imaging, which allows valuable biopsy specimens to be used
for downstream biomarker assessment, and (4) a simplified process with cost benefits for healthcare institutions
and payers. In recent years, we have developed a technology, open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscopy, to
enable high-throughput nondestructive 3D histology of ex vivo specimens. Our first generations of OTLS
microscopes and imaging protocols demonstrated the ability to reliably image a variety of optically cleared clinical
tissue specimens (surgical excisions and biopsies) in a nondestructive manner that does not interfere with
conventional pathology methods. Here, we propose to develop a multi-resolution hybrid OTLS microscope (Aim
1), based on a novel non-orthogonal dual-objective (NODO) architecture, which will be superior in every regard
to our previous systems, including resolution (and range of resolutions), imaging depth, and compatibility with
nearly all clearing/labeling protocols and sample-holder materials (insensitivity to refractive-index mismatch).
Furthermore, we will develop innovative pre-imaging methods to automate and standardize the tissue-labeling
and clearing process for a robust fluorescent analog of H&E staining (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop post-
imaging technologies for image-guided macro-dissection of thick tissues, which we will show has the ability to
significantly improve the sensitivity of genomic assays (Aim 3). Collectively, our project aims are designed to
extend current 2D pathology workflows into 3D to minimize clinical-adoption barriers. A rapid translational
pathway exists through a 3D-pathology-services company (Lightspeed Microscopy Inc.) that has licensed our
entire 3D pathology IP portfolio. As part of this larger translational effort, clinical studies are ongoing in our labs,
along with development of AI-analysis methods for clinical decision-support (i.e. prognostication and prediction
of treatment response). The instrumentation platform developed in this project will directly support a number of
future disease-focused clinical studies to demonstrate the value of 3D pathology for the precision treatment of
diverse conditions such as kidney disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and various forms of cancer."

Circadian clocks orchestrate myriad molecular, physiological, and behavioral processes to insure internal
temporal order and optimal daily timing. In animals, the master clock resides deep within the brain where it relies
on complex neural networks to ensure a robust internal sense of time that can readily synchronize with 24-h
environmental cycle. There is growing consensus that the operation of our master circadian clock under modern
light and social environments contributes significantly to a troubling array of health challenges. Understanding
the neural mechanisms underlying circadian timekeeping and the synchronization of the master pacemaker with
environmental cycles (i.e., entrainment) is therefore critical. A significant barrier to our understanding of the
central circadian clock is the complexity of its constituent neural networks, a complexity compounded by the fact
that clock-containing neurons employ multiple neurochemical signals that act via distinct signaling mechanisms.
Critical clock neurons in both mammals and insects express multiple transmitters – including peptide co-
transmitters - some of which function as local signals across defined synapses while others act as diffusible
signals that act over large distances. Peptide co-release, though a common feature of nervous systems, is not
well understood. Likewise, how clock neurons employ both local and paracrine signals to mediate circadian
timekeeping and entrainment remains enigmatic. Here we propose to study key peptidergic clock neurons in
Drosophila as a model to examine how two neuropeptides released from the same neuron can mediate distinct
behavioral and physiological functions to support robust circadian timekeeping and entrainment. Our work will
not only inform our understanding of circadian timekeeping in the mammalian brain but will also be relevant to
the mechanism of peptide co-release generally."

Susan Yoon, PhD, MSW, is a social scientist whose overarching career goal is to prevent substance use and
improve health outcomes among vulnerable, at-risk youth by identifying key mechanisms for risk and resilience
to adolescent substance use following child maltreatment. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development
Award will provide Dr. Yoon with rigorous training and systematic mentored research experiences that will
accelerate her successful transition to an independent investigator in the field of adolescent substance use
research. A team of highly qualified and committed mentors, who are prominent researchers in their respective
fields, will guide and supervise her K01 research and training activities. The proposed career development plan
encompasses four hands-on training goals to improve her knowledge and skills in: 1) adolescent substance
use research with vulnerable youth; 2) the use of contextual/spatial (i.e., activity space) data; 3) the application
of the resilience framework; and 4) advanced statistics, including person-centered analysis, multi-level
modeling, and spatial analysis. During the K01 award period, Dr. Yoon will obtain and apply these new skills
and knowledge to address important questions about the complex associations among child maltreatment,
youth activity spaces—refers to areas or places a person visits in daily routine—and adolescent substance
use. Child maltreatment and adolescent substance use are two serious, tightly connected public health
concerns. Despite the well-established link between these phenomena, the underlying mechanisms and
moderators (protective factors) of this link remains elusive, significantly hampering our ability to effectively
prevent adolescent substance use. Thus, the proposed study aims to: 1) examine how distinct patterns of
longitudinal maltreatment experiences are associated with different patterns of adolescent substance use
trajectories; 2) investigate the mediating effects of risky attributes within youth's activity spaces on the
association between child maltreatment and adolescent substance use; and 3) determine the extent to which
protective attributes within youth's activity spaces buffers the impact of child maltreatment on substance use
during adolescence. To address the study aims, Dr. Yoon will employ creative integration and analysis of
diverse data sources, including data linkage between administrative child welfare records and geo-coded youth
spatial exposure data. The study also introduces theoretical innovation through the integration of resilience
theory and novel spatially-situated protective factors to understand resilience to substance use following child
maltreatment. This study directly addresses NIDA's research priorities and strategic goals of supporting
research to understand the complex interactions of environmental, behavioral, and social factors influencing
drug use trajectories. Findings will offer valuable insight into key contextual mechanisms and protective factors
that can be targeted in interventions to prevent substance use among high-risk, vulnerable youth."
10809687,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate novel imaging biomarker(s) that use multiparameter MRI
methods to identify the true spatial extent of glial brain tumors. The standard RANO (response assessment in
neuro-oncology) criteria define tumor extent as the region of bright signal on post-contrast agent T1w (T1+C)
images, termed the contrast enhancing lesion (CEL), along with the peritumoral bright signal on T2w FLAIR
images, referred to as non-enhancing lesion (NEL). Yet, the CEL reflects the permeability of the blood-brain
barrier to contrast agent and can appear the same for both tumor and treatment effect. Likewise, though NEL
likely contains tumor, current imaging cannot distinguish tumor from edema. These difficulties result in the
inability of current anatomical MRI methods to determine the true spatial extent of glial tumors, a
serious limitation for treatment management of brain tumor patients.
We and others have shown that advanced MRI methods, including perfusion and diffusion MRI, are useful for
assessing tumor grade, predicting outcomes, or distinguishing tumor from treatment effect. Yet, almost
exclusively, the approach has been to extract mean values of a single physiological parameter from
predetermined tumor regions of interest and then measure their correlation with the desired clinical index.
Although this approach has been useful for initial biomarker development, it underutilizes the rich
multiparameter and spatial information available, thus motivating the current study. First, two multiparameter
MRI biomarkers will be developed to identify enhancing and infiltrating tumor burden. Then, they will be
evaluated individually and in combination to assess the total tumor burden in comparison with the standard
volumetric metrics in current use.
The development and testing of these biomarkers will be accomplished in several independent steps outlined
by the proposed aims. First (Aim 1), we propose to develop an MRI biomarker that gives the voxelwise
probability of enhancing tumor burden within CEL, with early results showing the ability to distinguish tumor
from treatment effect. Next, we will develop a multiparameter biomarker capable of identifying infiltrating tumor
within NEL (Aim 2). These efforts leverage our previous results using artificial intelligence, recent advances in
machine learning, and our unique brain tumor tissue bank with hundreds of biopsy samples spatially matched
to imaging. Finally (Aim 3), the spatial extent of tumor burden within CEL and NEL will be tested in their ability
to distinguish pseudo-progression/response from true progression/response, which is a primary question that
confounds treatment management today.
In summary, multiparameter advanced MRI biomarkers of enhancing and infiltrative brain tumor have the
potential to cause a paradigm shift in how treatment is managed, ultimately resulting in improved outcomes."
10815572,"Patients with advanced thyroid cancer are frequently refractory to radioiodine (RAI) therapy. Oncoproteins that constitutively activate MAPK signaling suppress expression of genes that control thyroid differentiated function and response to RAI, which can be reversed, at least in part, with RAF or MEK inhibitors in mouse models and in pilot clinical trials. These treatments are less effective in BRAFV600E-mutant cancers, which we showed to be due to adaptive resistance to RAF or MEK inhibitors. Profound MAPK pathway blockade increases iodide uptake but does not increase iodine retention time in mouse BrafV600E PTCs. This is because these compounds
relieve negative feedback inputs that increase PI3K signaling, which impairs expression of genes required for iodide oxidation and incorporation into thyroglobulin (TG). This can be rescued by combined treatment with a pan-PI3K inhibitor. The goal of this proposal is to build on the progress so far to attain greater efficacy of redifferentiation therapies in patients with thyroid cancer who are most likely to benefit. We propose to do this by: 1. Investigating whether selective PI3K isoform or HER kinase inhibitors increase iodide retention and RAI efficacy in the context of MAPK blockade. 2. Test the effects of the RAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the pan-PI3K inhibitor copanlisib on expression of iodide organification genes and how this relates to lesional 124I uptake and retention time in patients with RAI-refractory BRAFV600E metastatic thyroid cancer. 3. Identify molecular predictors of RAI efficacy in patients who had exceptional structural responses to conventional or MAPK-inhibitor enhanced RAI treatment using a case-control study design. 4) Develop novel therapeutic bispecific antibodies to redirect polyclonal T cells to target adaptive responses to MAPK inhibitors."
10799667,"Abstract:
Immunotherapy is becoming a pillar of cancer treatment, and many responsive patients have experienced
durable, or even curative, outcomes. For reasons that remain unclear, however, only a minority of cancer
patients benefit from immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. Expanding this remarkable
achievement to most cancer patients is being actively sought through multiple avenues, including
combined immunotherapy, such as blocking both PD-1 and CTLA-4. In addition, promising results have
been observed when ICB therapies were combined with available chemotherapies that potentiate the
immune-mediated anti-tumor response. This opens the possibility that the use of small molecules could
restore the immune system’s recognition of cancer cells as a foreign entity and thus would potentiate
immunotherapeutic progress. In this context, we have identified a cyclic peptide, EnnA, as a novel inhibitor
of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), with a potent ability to unleash the immune system against tumor cells.
This discovery stemmed from our effort to find new Hsp90 inhibitors that circumvent known side effects
that have hampered the clinical progress of first-generation inhibitors. In particular, this compound does
not induce a heat shock response, which had reduced the efficacy of early inhibitors through activation of
pro-survival mechanisms. EnnA induces immunogenic cancer cell death, promotes tumor immune cell
infiltration, and unleashes a powerful T cell-mediated immune response, resulting in highly efficacious
tumor killing in a syngeneic mouse model. Molecularly, EnnA interferes with several oncogenic pathways
and reduces the protein level of the programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), a key mediator of tumor-
induced immune tolerance. We therefore propose that EnnA is a promising anti-tumor agent targeting
Hsp90 through a novel mechanism of action involving cancer cell toxicity that increases its immunogenicity
and modulation of the tumor microenvironment to reduce immunotolerance. In Aim 1, we will perform
preclinical development of EnnA as a drug to determine its toxicity and the potential impact of EnnA on the
immune system of mice. We will also characterize the EnnA-Hsp90 interaction through mutational and
biochemical analyses. In Aim 2, we will determine how inhibition of Hsp90 by EnnA interferes with PD-L1
chaperoning and function. In Aim 3, we will define immune cell mechanisms underlying EnnA’s anti-tumor
effect. Combining EnnA with anti-CTLA-4 will be tested, and comprehensive profiling of immune cells
involved in the anti-tumor activity will be implemented. In Aim 4, we will test the importance of EnnA-
induced cancer cell autophagy and Hsp90 cell surface exposure in immune-dependent tumor eradication.
If successful, these studies will shed light on the role of the Hsp90 in promoting immune tolerance and will
provide an innovative approach to potentiate immunotherapy using a novel Hsp90 inhibitor."
10812432,"Project Abstract:
The human granzymes are a somewhat mystical class of five serine proteases (A, B, H, K, M) that are expressed
and conditionally secreted by select lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) and cytotoxic T cells (CTL). Based
largely on data for A and B, granzymes have been historically regarded as pro-apoptotic effectors whereby they
are presented transiently by NK and CTLs at the immunological synapse with a problematic target cell (e.g.
cancer cell, pathogen infected cell), and immediately shuttled into the cytosol via perforin to initiate cell death.
However, emerging data has begun to challenge this canon and present a more complex model in which
secreted granzymes perform essential signaling functions in extracellular space, including activation of
macrophages as part of host defense. Interestingly, dysregulation of granzyme presentation and/or proteolytic
activity may also underlie the pathobiology of debilitating diseases like neurodegenerative or systemic
autoimmune diseases. Thus, more fully elaborating the biology of granzymes is an important unmet need, and
requires technologies to study granzymes in the most clinically relevant animal models and humans themselves.
To this end, we developed a novel imaging approach we term “restricted interaction peptides” (RIP) to detect
granzyme proteolytic activity in vivo with PET. Mechanistically, RIPs are administered as an inactive pro-form,
whereupon internal cleavage of the RIP by the target endoprotease releases a radiolabeled peptide that
immediately associates with nearby phospholipid membranes (i.e. the plasma membrane of the target cell).
Thus, accumulation of the radiolabeled cleavage product adjacent to the endoprotease provides a readout of the
relative units of enzyme activity within a region of interest. As preliminary data, we developed 64Cu-GB1, a RIP
that measures granzyme B activity on PET. Our proof of concept data show that 64Cu-GB1 detects the cytotoxic
pool of granzyme B activity trafficking to pathogenic target cells, but also an unexpected non-cytotoxic pool
elicited as part of an inflammatory response to an endotoxin. During this project, we will expand upon these
data in several important directions. First, we will test in Aim 1 if 64Cu-GB1 can be applied to study granzyme B
proteolytic activity in the spontaneous immune responses arising due to pathogen stimulation. These data will
be crucial to understanding the utility of this methodology beyond simply detecting pharmacologically augmented
anticancer immune responses. During Aim 2, we will expand the RIP toolkit to develop and study probes
targeting the tryptase proteolytic activities of granzymes A and K. During the final Aim, we will carry out the late
stage preclinical experiments required to judge the feasibility of human imaging with RIP probes. As a model
system, we will study our lead candidate 64Cu-GB1. If successful, this project will confer new translational
technologies at a crucial inflection point away from the classical view as simply pro-apoptotic effectors toward
multifaceted regulators of human immunology and host defense against pathogens."

Peripheral nerve injury remains a significant problem in the United States and among the Veteran population.
Even after decades of research, there are few clinically available approaches to treat long-gap peripheral nerve
injury. Often, long-gap peripheral nerve repair is facilitated through harvest and placement of sural nerve
autografts into the injury site. Sural nerve isolation induces donor site morbidity, and some patients are unable
to donate neural tissue due to other co-morbidities (such as diabetes). As alternatives to the autografts, nerve
allografts and biomaterial scaffolds have emerged as possible approaches to supplant the autograft. However,
allografts require extensive decellularization processes, and it is challenging to find size-matched allografts for
patients. Biomaterial conduits can be shaped into appropriate sizes. Many biomaterial conduits lack sufficient
extracellular matrix to promote extensive regeneration of axons. In total, autograft, allograft, and biomaterial
strategies routinely fail to completely rescue lost function. Thus, new strategies are needed to advance the
field. Biomaterial conduits that consist of aligned, electrospun fibers robustly promote axonal regeneration in
preclinical models of peripheral nerve injury. Fibrous materials are produced using synthetic, degradable
polymers that contain no extracellular matrix. Schwann cells migrating into the injury site are responsible for
producing sufficient ECM to foster robust regeneration. Unfortunately, Schwann cells immediately after
peripheral nerve injury reduce their production of key growth factors, such as neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). Therefore,
Schwann cells are unable to produce sufficient factors to create ECM and growth factors to robustly induce
regeneration. Inclusion of exogenous stem cells and Schwann cells that release regenerative factors or use of
biomaterials that release growth factors improve regeneration in preclinical models. However, cellular explants
from donor tissue require immunosuppression, and it is difficult to release proteins from degradable polymers
(which typically require harsh chemicals for polymer synthesis). Harsh chemicals used to fabricate biomaterial
scaffolds denature growth factors, requiring investigation of alternative approaches. In this SPiRE application,
we propose to develop mRNA-releasing fibrous scaffolds and assess the ability of the mRNA-releasing
scaffolds to promote peripheral regeneration in a pre-clinical injury model. In total, the development of new
biomaterial approaches to treat peripheral nerve injury may lead to new tools capable of promoting robust
peripheral nerve regeneration for the Veteran population."
10867302,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem, afflicting an estimated 15% (37
million) of US adults. Among Veterans, the prevalence of CKD is nearly 50% higher than that of the US
general population. CKD-associated mortality is significantly higher than that of the general population
and worsens with each stage of progressive CKD. The reason for these adverse outcomes is generally
attributed to the development of cardiovascular disease and changes in myocardial size. There are
several critical gaps in our current knowledge of cardiac remodeling in CKD. Our long term goal is to
identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for CKD-induced cardiomyopathy.
 We have previously identified that signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) is upregulated as a
mediator of CKD-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscles. Specifically, that CKD stimulates
inflammation to upregulate SIRPα in skeletal muscles of mice and patients with CKD. Subsequently,
SIRPα promotes insulin resistance in skeletal muscles and adipose tissue causing cachexia. CKD
stimulates the opposite responses in the heart with increases in myocardial mass. The significance of
our proposal is that we provide evidence for a differential role of SIRPα in mediating cachexia in skeletal
muscles and adipose tissues while contributing to the development of increased cardiac muscle growth.
We predict cardiac remodeling in CKD may be the result of impairments in myocardial insulin/insulin
growth factor-1 (IGF1) receptor signaling.
 CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS: SIRPα behaves as a novel myokine impairing myocardial
insulin/IGF1 receptor functions while promoting CKD-induced cardiomyopathy. Guided by strong
preliminary data we propose three Specific Aims to characterize the metabolic milieu of CKD and its
effects on myocardial mass: (1) Determine if SIRPα exacerbates myocardial insulin/IGF1 receptor
signaling in CKD. (2) Identify CKD-specific (i.e. uremia) triggers that cause SIRPα release. (3) Evaluate
the anti-proteolytic effects of SIRPα in modulating myocardial protein turnover in CKD.
 Our goal is to determine if SIRPα interacts with insulin/IGF1 receptor impairing intracellular
signaling to promote myocardial growth and cardiac dysfunction. This discovery will stimulate novel
targets for therapies to prevent CKD-associated heart failure and potentially improve the lives of
Veterans suffering from its deleterious consequences."

Several neurological and mental health disorders, including addiction, depression, chronic pain, and Parkinson’s
disease, have notable sex differences in their prevalence, severity, or symptom presentation, which can be
further amplified when co-morbidity is considered. Consequently, sex is an important variable to consider when
developing potential treatment. Amongst the symptoms common to such disorders are changes in motivated
behavior resulting from abnormal motivation, processing of salient environmental cues, and reward learning.
Altered function of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are central to the changes in motivated behavior associated
with these symptoms and, in addition, DA neuronal activity is modulated by circulating gonadal hormones. The
lateral habenula (LHb) is also a significant regulator of DA cell firing and has been implicated in these same
disorders. Despite this, little work has investigated the role of sex and gonadal hormones on LHb function. Our
preliminary data have shown clear sex differences in LHb function, with the LHb having less inhibitory control
over DA cells in female rats and with the LHb displaying a more regular firing pattern in female rats. Based on
these novel and exciting findings, as well as previous literature, we hypothesize that gonadal hormones modulate
both LHb activity and its ability to regulate midbrain neuronal activity. To determine the role circulating gonadal
hormones play in LHb-induced inhibition of midbrain DA neurons (Specific Aim 1) we will compare female rats
(intact, ovariectomized, or ovariectomized with estrogen replacement) and male rats (intact, castrated, or
castrated with testosterone replacement) using an in vivo electrophysiological approach. We predict that the
inhibitory effect of LHb stimulation on DA firing will become stronger in female rats following gonadectomy,
negating the previously observed sex difference. We further predict that the phenotypical sex difference will be
reinstated in female rats by estradiol replacement. To determine the role circulating gonadal hormones play in
LHb firing rate and pattern (Specific Aim 2) we will compare a separate cohort of rats with the same group
designations using an ex vivo electrophysiological approach. We predict that whole-cell patch-clamp recorded
LHb neurons will fire in a less regular pattern and have increased susceptibility to hyperpolarization-induced
burst firing in female rats following gonadectomy compared to their intact counterparts. We further predict that
the phenotypical firing patterns will be reinstated in female rats with estradiol replacement. There is a gap in our
knowledge regarding the interaction of the LHb and gonadal hormones; the proposed experiments are intended
to begin to fill that gap. These experiments have the potential to provide a brain circuit-based mechanism of
differing symptomatology by sex in several neurological and mental health disorders, leading to more precision
in treatment development."
10892026,"COVID-19 continues to be a global catastrophe despite development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. This is due
to the worldwide limited vaccine availability, vaccination hesitancy, and the emergence of new variants of SARS-
CoV-2. Moreover, there is a lack of complete knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 biology, including potential
transmission routes and variable pathogenesis, especially in ethnic groups, such as African American (AA) and
Hispanic/Latino that were disproportionally affected by COVID-19 compared to White Non-Hispanic (WNH)
population. The role of biological factors contributing to high infection, hospitalization, and death rates in these
groups remains to be investigated. Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on binding of the viral spike (S) protein
to the host cell receptor ACE2 and its priming/cleavage by host protease TMPRSS2. It is well accepted that the
main route of the SARS CoV-2 entry into the body is via respiratory epithelial cells. However, cells in other
tissues/organs including the heart, kidney, pancreas, eye and skin (mostly epidermis) also express ACE2 and
TMPRSS2. Some recent studies indicate that skin could be directly targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, viral RNA
and capsid proteins were detectable in skin biopsies. Importantly, some inflammatory skin diseases, such as
psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, significantly increased the risk of COVID-19. This correlates with the findings
that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was increased in lesional skin of psoriasis patients as well as in wounded
skin. In addition, COVID-19 is associated with dermatological immediate or sometimes persistent manifestations
which could occur because of direct (topical) or systemic (via circulating virus) infection by SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the potential role of human healthy or inflamed skin in SARS-CoV-2 entry and COVID-19
pathogenesis has not been addressed. It is known that TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-γ cytokines are involved in
the development of different inflammatory skin diseases and their level is increased during cytokine storm
frequently associated with viremia, multi-organ failure, and development of severe deadly COVID-19
.
In our pilot
experiments, we showed that combination of TNF-α + IL-6 + IL-1β + INF-γ strongly induced expression of ACE2
and TMPRSS2 in 3D human skin equivalents (3D-HSE) made from primary human epidermal keratinocytes
(NHEK). Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that inflamed skin could be infected by wild type SARS-
CoV-2 virus and its emerging mutated variants, and that higher infection rates reported for specific ethnic
populations may depend on higher expression levels of proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. To test these
hypotheses, we will use pseudotyped Spike (S) protein-containing reporter lentiviruses, 2D- and 3D-HSE
cultures made from AA, Hispanic and WNH keratinocytes pretreated with cytokine cocktails related to COVID-
19 cytokine storm (TNF-α+IL-6+IL-1b+INF-γ) or cytokines proven to induce pro-psoriasis (IL17+IL22+TNFa) or
pro-atopic dermatitis (IL4+IL13) molecular and morphological changes in in vitro skin models."

Salivary glands produce saliva, which facilitates digestion, acts as a lubricant to swallow foods, and prevents
infections in oral cavity and tooth decay. Therefore, salivary gland function is important for oral health. Currently,
there is no effective treatment for impaired salivary glands, which can be caused by therapeutic irradiation for
the head and neck cancer or autoimmune diseases. To develop therapeutic strategies in the future, it is essential
to understand the regulatory mechanisms underling development of salivary glands and their regeneration. Little
is known about the regulators of gene expression, epigenetics and chromatin organization for salivary glands.
Here, we will test a hypothesis that the genome organizer SATB1 is a critical regulator in salivary gland
embryonic development, early postnatal growth and development, and function. This hypothesis is supported
by SATB1 protein being expressed in both acinar and ductal cells at postnatal day 12 (P12) of wild-type mice
and by detection of much smaller salivary glands in Satb1-/- mice compared to wild-type mice. We will identify
SATB1 protein-expressing cells in SGs during embryonic and postnatal development. By genetic lineage tracing,
we will study the role of SATB1 in acinar cell development and function. We will delete SATB1 in acinar cell-
specific cell lineages (e.g. AQPT5+ or MIST1+ cells) at specific time points and determine the effects of SATB1
ablation in their descendants. Through these experiments, we will learn the roles of SATB1 in proliferation,
morphogenesis, survival and growth during embryonic and early postnatal development. In addition, combining
the lineage-tracing approach with Global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), which captures nascent transcripts, we
will identify genes regulated by SATB1 in a cell lineage-specific and stage-specific manner. We expect that
results from these proposed experiments will uncover the critical contribution of SATB1 in salivary gland
development, growth and function, and such information will likely provide the foundation for the future
therapeutic design to promote salivary gland regeneration."

Exposure to non-optimal outdoor temperatures is responsible for an estimated 125,000 deaths and 1.8 million

vulnerability, which constrains the ability of decision makers to protect high-risk groups through targeted policy
interventions. Here we leverage the recent introduction of ICD-10 Z-codes – which encode the social
determinants of health – to investigate potential risk factors for temperature-related morbidity. The study will
focus on the period 2016-2020 in six states: Arizona, California, Georgia, Missouri, New York and Oregon.
Temperature data will come from a national 1km2 meteorological product and health data from state-level
government health agencies or hospital associations. We will use a case-crossover study design to estimate
short-term associations between outdoor temperature and emergency department visits for all-causes and
cardiorespiratory causes. Assessment of effect modification of these associations by individual-level social
determinants of health (derived from Z-codes) will focus on social domains related to housing,
income/deprivation, social isolation, and institutional living (Aim 1). In addition, we will explore potential
interactions between individual-level and area-level social determinants of temperature vulnerability, with the
latter derived primarily from the American Community Survey (Aim 2). Stratifying on area-level indicators of the
social determinants of health will allow us to explore how any individual-level effects are dependent on the
context within which they occur; it is possible that some effects will vary with respect to characteristics of the
broader living environment. Timely knowledge of temperature vulnerability can help tailor interventions including
public health messaging, warning systems, infrastructure investments and neighborhood outreach programs. As
climate change impacts are expected to disproportionately affect already-disadvantaged populations, it is
essential to better understand climate-sensitive risks across sub-groups in order to prevent the exacerbation of
health disparities. Results from these aims will also provide methodological directions for future use of Z-codes
in environmental epidemiology, can be expanded to include other US states and other environmental exposures,
and can guide other types of studies exploring vulnerability to temperature."
10766273,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Funded by one of the inaugural R38 awards from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the
Children’s National Stimulating Access to Research in Residency (CNStARR) Program is an existing mentored
program of career development and research training. It has dramatically expanded our institution’s capacity to
recruit and retain outstanding residents with demonstrated potential and interest in pursuing research careers
in content areas of interest to the NHLBI with a special emphasis on asthma and airway diseases, congenital
heart disease, and hematology and immunology. Each content area was chosen because of the depth and
breadth of our locally available, committed, and highly experienced preceptors. Leveraging the existing
collaborations between Children’s National Hospital (CNH) and George Washington University (GWU) such as
their jointly held Clinical and Translational Science Institute, CNStARR will recruit residents in pediatrics from
CNH and in internal medicine from GWU. Utilizing the existing infrastructure of the Children’s Hospital
Research in Residency Program and as well as highly tailored and focused Individual Development Plans,
CNStARR provides its scholars with both the didactic competencies and the transformative mentored
experiences in basic, clinical, or translational research to prepare them as successful, independent clinician-
scientists. The most proximate goal of CNStARR is to accelerate the transition of participants to subsequent
mentored career development awards, particularly the “Stimulating Access to Research and Residency
Transition Support,” the linked individual K38 mechanism from the National Institutes of Health, as well as
other mechanisms such as T32 and F32 appointments, our institutional KL2 and K12 awards, or individual K-
series awards. CNStARR scholars will join the future academic leaders in research areas of relevance to
NHLBI. Ultimately, they will direct research teams, compete successfully for grant support, and add
significantly to our understanding of the etiology and treatment of heart, lung, and blood disorders across the
human life span. Because academic medicine in general (and pediatrics and internal medicine) suffers
grievously from a shortage of investigators from backgrounds under-represented in medicine (UIM), CNStARR
will pursue an intentional and deliberate strategy to identify, recruit, and retain scholars from backgrounds UIM."
10731370,"Peripheral nerve damage is a debilitating consequence of both traumatic injury to the extremities of
soldiers, and a secondary outcome following spinal cord injury (SCI). Equally devastating, for both the Veteran
and general population, is nerve damage during excision of surrounding tissue, disease, or iatrogenic injury.
Functional recovery from nerve damage is often incomplete, resulting in impaired motor function, sensory loss,
and pain. Recovery is especially poor for chronic nerve injuries, which can result from unrepaired nerves or
from delayed or failed primary repair. A major challenge in treating nerve injury is the current lack of effective
methods to medically image nerves. As a consequence, surgeons are unable to accurately assess the extent
of nerve injury, plan surgical intervention in an informed and data-driven manner, or assess the success of
nerve repair at early time points, to predict long-term recovery.
 We have developed innovative quantitative strategies for nerve imaging, which overcome challenges
created by the complex structure and architecture of nerves. Our approach employs two widely deployed
clinical modalities, ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our imaging approach is
motivated by strong preliminary data demonstrating that quantitative US (qUS) and MRI (qMRI) are powerful
and clinically feasible strategies for monitoring nerve structure and composition at high-resolution and with high
sensitivity. These approaches are also intended to provide non-invasive surrogates for biological changes that
occur during nerve degeneration and regeneration, but which cannot be evaluated in patients. To establish the
validity and utility of qUS and qMRI in evaluating nerve structure and composition in a clinical setting, we will
address the following specific aims in rat (Aim 1) and human (Aim 2) models of acute and chronic nerve injury:
1) To test the efficacy of quantitative US and MR imaging strategies in assessing neuromuscular morphology
and composition during peripheral nerve degeneration and following repair of acute and chronic models of rat
sciatic nerve injury. 2) To test the clinical efficacy of quantitative US and MR imaging strategies in assessing
neuromuscular morphology and composition in acute and chronic models of human median and ulnar nerve
injury immediately prior to surgical repair.
 Our approach has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of nerve injury. Immediate clinical
impacts include: (i) objective guidance on deciding whether to perform nerve repair or nerve transfer surgery;
(ii) predicting and monitoring the efficacy of nerve repair; (iii) guidance for post-op rehabilitation protocols. This
work will also set the stage for a prospective study in which imaging strategies will be deployed as prognostic
tools for predicting the efficacy of neuromuscular recovery following nerve repair, towards improved treatment
of nerve injury in Veteran and general populations. More broadly, our nerve imaging strategy will aid in the
diagnosis and prediction of nerve structure and damage for a wider array of neuropathies and nerve diseases."
10996076,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our goal is to understand the transcriptional requirements for erythroid-myeloid progenitor (EMP)
development and differentiation into monocytes and tissue resident macrophages (TRM).
Hematopoiesis is comprised of three waves: primitive hematopoiesis, transient-definitive hematopoiesis and
definitive hematopoiesis1–6. Transient-definitive and definitive hematopoiesis require EMPs and hematopoietic
stem cell (HSCs), respectively. EMPs are required for embryonic development until HSCs take over as the
primary hematopoietic progenitors and thus absence of EMPs results in midgestation lethality7. Despite their
importance in fetal development, much remains unknown regarding the transcriptional requirements for EMP
development, in part due to shared surface markers and genetic programs between overlapping waves of
hematopoiesis and terminally differentiated lineages. Additionally, EMP-derived monocytes are recognized as
the main source of majority of the TRM populations in adults4,8,9. TRMs are eventually replaced in the adult by
HSC-derived monocytes at tissue-specific rates. The developmental and functional differences between EMP-
derived and HSC-derived TRM and the impact on tissue homeostasis are not well-understood. Previous
studies and preliminary data indicate that the transcriptional factor Zeb2 is not only required for the
maintenance of TRM identity but also required for EMP formation and/or differentiation. We hypothesize that
Zeb2 is required for the development and differentiation of primitive hematopoietic progenitors and transient-
definitive EMPs. We aim to identify novel regulatory elements and transcription factors regulating Zeb2
expression during primitive and transient-definitive hematopoiesis.
I am currently a MD-PhD candidate at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, an institution
with a long history of supporting physician-scientists at all stages of their training and is working with a strongly
committed mentoring team. The proposed training plan provides new conceptual and technical training, along
with scientific, clinical, and career development activities that support a trajectory to become an independent
physician-scientist focused on discovering mechanisms of hematopoietic development and lineage
differentiation and applying this knowledge toward advancing novel therapeutic strategies."
10904634,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a rare but potentially fatal blood disorder, resulting
from autoantibodies against ADAMTS13, a plasma metalloprotease that cleaves endothelial von Willebrand
factor. Despite progresses being made in past decades, major gap remains in our understanding the
pathogenesis of iTTP. The proposed study will test the hypotheses that: 1) distinct molecular signatures in the
complementarity determining region (CDR)-3 and the VDJ rearrangements in the variable regions of
immunoglobulins (Ig) against ADAMTS13 determine their functionalities (e.g., the inhibitory vs. activating) in
patients with iTTP; 2) the abnormalities in ANKRD26 and 36 gene family, initially identified to associate with
hereditary thrombocytopenia, may also play a role in pathogenesis of iTTP, likely through disruption of
megakaryocytopoiesis and enhanced immune inflammatory responses. The proposed study will use various
cutting-edge tools and animal models to test these hypotheses. The results of the proposed study will shed
new light on pathogenesis of iTTP and other immune thrombotic disorders. The findings may help develop
novel strategies for therapeutic interventions for such disorders."
10808095,"We have identified TCF21 as the coronary artery disease (CAD) associated gene mapped by genome-wide
association studies at 6q23.2 and employed numerous mechanistic approaches to show that it promotes a
smooth muscle cell (SMC) transition to a fibroblast like “fibromyocyte” phenotype, and the contribution of these
cells to the protective fibrous cap. Our studies with another CAD associated gene, the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AHR), have characterized the transition of SMC to a second, chondrogenic “chondromyocyte”
phenotype. To extend this work and investigate the mechanisms of epigenetic signaling upstream of TCF21,
AHR, and other factors that mediate SMC cell state, we are focusing efforts on the CAD associated platelet
derived growth factor D gene (PDGFD). We have shown that PDGFD regulates TCF21 and other validated
CAD genes including LMOD1, CXCL12, and SMAD3, and is expressed primarily in disease transition SMC that
also express the PDGFRB receptor. Together, these data suggest that PDGFD activates an autocrine
signaling pathway that modulates SMC phenotype and CAD risk. The hypothesis directing this research
postulates that PDGFD promotes CAD risk through its regulation of TCF21 and other key disease
related transcription factors that mediate the SMC phenotypic response to vascular stress. The primary
goals of the work proposed here are thus to identify the PDGFD target transcription factors (TFs) that regulate
SMC transitions and characterize their transcriptional program in this cell type. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will
employ Pdgfd knockout and SMC lineage tracing in the ApoE null mouse atherosclerosis model to characterize
the effect of this gene on SMC cell state transitions, and the impact of perturbing these transitions on disease
morphology and cellular anatomy. In Aim 2, we will conduct single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in Pdgfd
null and wildtype atherosclerotic mice to characterize the SMC gene expression program downstream of Pdgfd
in this cell type. Single cell ATAC sequencing (scATACseq) in the same animals will map enhancers genome-
wide that are differentially regulated in SMC phenotypic transitions, and identify specific TFs that bind these
enhancers to regulate expression of fibromyocyte and chondromyocyte specific genes. In Aim 3, we will
perturb candidate SMC transition promoting TFs that are identified in Aim 2, in vitro in a PDGFD stimulated
human coronary artery smooth muscle cell de-differentiation model, and the resulting transcriptomic and cell
state effects interpreted in the context of PDGFD function in this model. These studies will link PDGFD to CAD
associated genes that we have characterized in the context of SMC phenotypic transition (TCF21, AHR,
SMAD3, TWIST1), and to additional high probability CAD genes that regulate SMC phenotype, to expand the
disease transcriptional network in this vascular cell type. This work will advance our understanding of
atherosclerosis pathophysiology and promote efforts to target vascular wall molecular processes to ameliorate
CAD risk."
10793621,"ABSTRACT
Neuroblastoma is the most common solid tumor in infants. About 25% of patients have high-risk
neuroblastoma, a devastating disease with poor prognosis and few treatment options. The primary driver of
high-risk neuroblastoma is the oncogene MYCN, a MYC-family transcription factor that has no druggable
pockets and has long eluded drug development efforts.
 Recently, the protein kinase Aurora A (AurA) was shown to bind to the N-Myc protein in neuroblastoma
cells and interfere with its ubiquitination by the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, preventing N-Myc from being
degraded by the proteosome. Blocking complex formation between AurA and N-Myc results in rapid N-Myc
degradation and cell death in neuroblastoma cell lines. The same AurA/N-Myc complex has now been shown
to drive neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), and AurA also forms a similar complex with the closely-
related c-Myc protein in liver cancer. These recent discoveries point to a new paradigm for targeting Myc-
family transcription factors in cancer using inhibitors that trigger structural changes in AurA that block
Myc protein binding and promote Myc degradation.
 Our lab has recently shown that most existing AurA inhibitors, including the current clinical candidate
alisertib, do not have a strong enough allosteric effect on AurA to be effective at weakening N-Myc binding. In
agreement with this, alisertib has inconsistent effects on N-Myc levels in cell lines, and has not performed well
in ongoing clinical trials in neuroblastoma and NEPC. The weakness in our current understanding of how AurA
binds to c-Myc and N-Myc and how these interactions are affected by inhibitors represents a major impediment
to this therapeutic strategy for targeting Myc-driven cancers.
 The goal of this project is to provide the missing molecular picture of the interactions between
AurA and Myc transcription factors and how they can be modulated by inhibitor binding. We plan to use
new experimental tools and approaches to define how the binding of c-Myc and N-Myc alters the conformation
(shape) and dynamics (protein motion) of AurA, and to delineate the specific structural changes an inhibitor
must trigger to efficiently destabilize these complexes. We will a) define the structure of the AurA/Myc
complexes at atomic resolution using x-ray crystallography, magnetic resonance spectroscopies and molecular
modeling, b) determine how these interactions alter AurA conformation and dynamics by tracking key structural
elements of the kinase in solution, c) correlate the effects of a large panel of kinase inhibitors on AurA
conformation with their ability to alter the binding affinities of N-Myc and c-Myc, and d) test the efficiency of the
strongest AurA allosteric modulators in a series of N-Myc- and c-Myc-dependent cancer cell lines including
neuroblastoma, NEPC and liver cancer cells. The insights will pave the way for the repurposing of existing
kinase inhibitors and the development of new inhibitors as a new treatment modality for Myc-driven cancers."
10819226,"ABSTRACT
It is well accepted that intrinsic action of the androgen receptor (AR) within the prostate epithelium drives prostate
cancer proliferation and survival. Less appreciated is the fact that AR is also expressed in the stroma surrounding
the epithelium. Stromal-expressed AR acts extrinsically to maintain the differentiated striated basal and luminal
epithelium of the normal gland. During prostate cancer development, AR expression in the stroma is lost. How
AR is lost from the stroma and how its loss promotes prostate cancer development is unknown. Our objectives
are to define the mechanism that leads to stromal-specific AR loss and determine how AR loss in the stroma, in
conjunction with epithelial oncogenesis, promotes prostate cancer development Based on our preliminary data,
we hypothesize that tumor-derived TNFα/TGFβ1 transcriptionally suppresses AR expression in the stroma,
causing loss of FGF10 and Wnt16 secretion, which are required to maintain the stratified epithelium through
induction of luminal cells and maintenance of basal cells, respectively. To test this, we developed the first human
Prostate-on-Chip model by culturing basal epithelial cells next to prostate stromal cells within a microfluidic
device. Within this model, we can fully recapitulate the stromal AR-dependent induction of luminal epithelial cell
differentiation. Furthermore, co-culturing normal stroma with tumor cells within this model leads to the induction
of CAF phenotypes and reduced stromal AR expression, mimicking the tumor/host interactions seen in vivo.
Models that recapitulate human glandular organization and its dysregulation during disease development are
critical for our mechanistic understanding of how stroma and oncogenic epithelial interactions drive tumor
development. We will test our hypothesis in three aims: 1) Determine the mechanism by which stromal AR
maintains prostate epithelial cell differentiation. Our working hypothesis is that stromal AR signaling induces
secretion of stromal FGF10 and Wnt16, which are required for induction of luminal epithelial cells and
maintenance of basal epithelial cells, respectively. 2) Determine the mechanism by which AR expression is lost
in the tumor stroma. Our working hypothesis is that tumor-secreted factors, TNFα and TGFβ1, acting through
NF-κB signaling, suppress transcription of the stromal AR gene independent of CAF conversion. 3) Determine
the functional consequence of tumor-induced stromal AR loss on prostate epithelial differentiation in a new de
novo in situ human prostate cancer model. Our working hypothesis is that tumor-induced stromal loss of AR-
dependent induction of Wnt16 and FGF10, via TNFα/TGFβ1, co-operates with epithelial oncogenes to accelerate
tumor development and induce loss of basal epithelial cells. The proposed studies will be the first to demonstrate
how TNFα/TGFβ-mediated suppression of stromal AR expression leads to the loss of Wnt16 and FGF10 to
promote prostate cancer development. These studies will also provide the framework for further development of
the first human Prostate-on-Chip model, which recapitulates human prostate biology, for basic and translation
cancer research."

for the past 20 years), who will direct mentoring and training, and Dr. Josiah D. Rich (MPI for the last cycle), who
will direct research project development. This training grant focuses on applied clinical and substance use
research in Rhode Island and beyond. Rhode Island has among the highest rates of substance use in the nation

University-affiliated Miriam Hospital Immunology Center, the largest HIV care center in Southern New England,
where approximately 60% of the patients engage in substance use (alcohol, cocaine, opioid,
methamphetamines, and poly-substance abuse). Our program’s strengths are our interdisciplinary collaborations
to reduce the infectious disease consequences of substance use, including HIV, hepatitis B and C, sexually
transmitted infections, and TB. This training program brings together core expertise from the Division of
Infectious Diseases, the Providence-Boston NIH funded Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), the NIH-funded
COBRE Center on Opioids and Overdose, the Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine, the Brown
University Center for Statistical Studies, and the Brown University School of Public Health. This interdisciplinary
training program focuses on HIV prevention and treatment, including innovative PrEP programs, and correctional
health, with a primary focus on reducing the infectious consequences of substance use as well as overdose. Our
mentors have strong track records in applied clinical, substance use, translational science, correctional health

10841498,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
My lab seeks to define the molecular logic of complex cell behaviors— how cells go from sets of interacting
molecules to the emergent properties of living systems. We currently focus on three questions: how
neutrophils control their shape and movement, how lymphocytes detect rare foreign peptides in a sea of self-
peptides, and how mouse embryonic stem cells regulate transcriptional activation. Studying a diversity of cell
types and behaviors makes it easier to identify the general principles of cellular decision-making beyond the
particulars of a given system. And it opens up more interfaces for cross pollination between different projects
in the lab. Transformative science often happens at interfaces, so we seek to borrow tools and concepts from
other fields to address open questions in cell biology and frequently develop new tools when they are needed
to accelerate progress. For instance, optogenetics enables us to plug into defined signaling nodes and test the
logic of subcircuits in a manner that circumvents the feedback, redundancy, and compensation that confound
investigation with standard approaches. Our most common strategy is to pair biosensors for visualizing the
quantitative dynamics of these processes in living cells with precision tools to control the regulators of these
behaviors. For cell migration, we are breaking down the complex process of directed movement into its
fundamental pieces—how a cell decides to initiate a protrusion, how the shape of the protrusion is specified,
how the protrusions compete with one another to enable cell polarity, and how this process is biased by
external gradients. For T cell activation, we are investigating how cells convert small differences in antigen
binding to large changes in cell activation by leveraging a light-responsive T cell antigen. Finally, we are
investigating the logic of transcriptional activation—in particular how enhancers activate promoters and how
transcription factor dynamics specifies the pattern of gene activation."
10829897,"Project Summary:
Each year millions of Americans develop chronic wounds, which require advanced wound care that has been
estimated to cost $50 Billion annually. However, our understanding of chronic wounds and how to treat them
has been limited by a lack of established methods to objectively characterize and measure wound features.
Detailed assessments of wounds in the clinic and research laboratory often occur through histological analysis
of tissue biopsies. This information can provide insight into cellular migration into the wound, cellular proliferation
at the edge of the wound, infection, and fibrosis. However, the collection, creation, and analysis of histology
sections is inherently invasive, time-consuming, and qualitative. The goal of this proposal is to develop an image
analysis pipeline that can provide automated quantitative analysis of wounds and lay the groundwork for a non-
invasive real-time “optical biopsy” that can provide information identical to standard histopathology. Our central
hypothesis is that artificial intelligence approaches using deep learning convolutional neural networks can be
coupled with in vivo multiphoton microscopy and existing quantitative image analysis methods to achieve this
goal with the same accuracy as traditional biopsies with histological staining and expert analysis. In Aim 1, we
will training and validate neural networks capable of segmenting and quantifying standard wound histology based
on training from three independent wound healing research labs. In Aim 2, we will adapt this network to perform
segmentation and quantification of in vivo label-free multiphoton microscopy images of skin wounds to provide
rapid readouts of wound organization and metabolic function. Finally in Aim 3, we will develop and validate a
network capable of generating virtual histology images from our stain-free non-invasive in vivo MPM images,
which can be coupled with the networks developed in Aim 1 and 2 to provide a comprehensive assessment of
wound microstructure and metabolism. In the near-term, this proposal will develop a series of robust analysis
tools that can be applied to existing H&E-stained or unstained skin tissue sections commonly studied by wound
healing researchers. In the long-term, the combination of label-free multiphoton microscopy and machine
learning-based image analysis will enable completely non-invasive wound histology that can be performed in
real-time at the point of care to guide debridement and wound care."
10893959,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the
abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of tau.
Important preliminary data has shown that tau PET with quantitative analysis can distinguish Braak III
vs IV NFT pathology. However, there is a gap in knowledge and only limited numbers of participants
have been evaluated with early Braak NFT stages (I-IV). We will leverage our database of 1779
participants who have had tau PET over the past 6 years who provide a well characterized cohort for
this study at substantial cost savings. Our hypotheses are that novel methods of assessing tau PET
will be associated with early Braak NFT stages (I-IV) and cognitive test abnormalities. We will test our
hypotheses in three aims:
Aim 1: Characterize tau PET measurements that are associated with early NFT.
We will use innovative tau PET analysis methods to predict early Braak NFT stage in a large sample of
early Braak NFT stage participants. We will use a novel method of quantitative tau PET assessment to
improve on prior methodologies and test tau PET for association with early Braak NFT stages.
Aim 2: Characterize tau PET features associated with cognitive test findings.
We will use tau PET to predict cognitive test findings in CU participants. Cognitive test findings
correlate best with tau PET in this regard vs MRI or amyloid PET and tau PET could be an optimal
therapeutic biomarker. We will use innovative tau PET imaging analysis methods to predict early
cognitive test findings in a large sample of CU.
Aim 3: Identify associations of different tau PET radiotracers with early neuropathologic tau
hyperphosphorylation and cognitive testing.
Alternative tau PET radiotracers may provide improved sensitivity for early NFT pathology and early
cognitive findings in CU participants. We will test the differential ability of an alternative tau PET
imaging drug to predict early Braak NFT stages and demonstrate association with cognitive tests.
This work will provide a rigorous assessment of the biological meaning of tau PET signal. It will have a
dramatic impact on treatment algorithms by identifying a subset with early tau deposition and therefore
higher risk for developing AD dementia than those with only suspected amyloid pathology. Here we
propose a multipronged approach to define tau PET imaging of early NFT and correlation with cognitive
test findings in cognitively unimpaired individuals. This proposal is transformative, considering the
novel concept of detecting NFT at early stages with state-of-art in vivo PET with novel methods
and pathologic correlation that could provide insight for asymptomatic prevention trials."

whose 86 faculty from 12 departments and three schools, has been bringing together the best
biomedical graduate students and faculty from across the grounds to generate a training forum that
complements classroom and laboratory experience. Students join an inclusive program in their second
year and remain associated with the program until they graduate. The training focuses on the second
and third years of Ph.D. training employing tools that guide students through the transition from class
knowledge to independent thinking and practical use of the scientific method. The CMB program
intensifies this transformative period by nurturing the students through a series of poster sessions, data
clubs, retreats, writing classes, mixers, and symposia to expose the students to outstanding multi-
disciplinary science from around the university. The program also builds professional skills through
mentor training, workshops on both scientific rigor and reproducibility and ethics, volunteer
opportunities in the Charlottesville community, and consistent exposure to emerging topics that affect
the biomedical community. Our goal is well rounded PhD trainees that can both employ the scientific
method to complex problems and also master the professional skills required for the numerous scientific
career choices of the 21st century. The past success of our trainees in both academic and nonacademic
scientific careers demonstrates that the CMB program prepares students to become leaders of

10846680,"The combined active antiretroviral therapy (cART) is critically important for improved HIV
management and patient care of HIV-infected individuals. Protease inhibitors (PIs) are important
components of cART regimens. The 2020 UNAIDS reports that 38 million people are living with
HIV/AIDS in 2019 and over 25 million people were accessing antiretroviral therapy. The cART
treatment regimen resulted in a significant reduction of HIV/AIDS-related mortality and greatly
improved life expectancies of those patients with access to cART. There is no cure for HIV/AIDS
and long-term treatment has posed a serious challenge because of the emergence of multidrug-
resistant HIV-1 variants. About 40-50% of those patients who initially achieved favorable viral
suppression to undetectable levels experienced treatment failure. These drug-resistant HIV
strains can be transmitted, raising further uncertainty with respect to future treatment options.
Also, neurocognitive dysfunction, known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) has
become a major concern. Furthermore, PIs are faced with traditional serious limitations including,
major toxicity, tolerance, and necessary adherence to complex medical regimens. The
development of a new generation of PIs effective against drug-resistant HIV with longer duration
of action, and improved CNS penetration properties for treatment and possible prevention of
devastating HAND, is vital to the future management of HIV/AIDS.
 Our highly collaborative research efforts led to the development of darunavir as an approved
drug for treatment against drug-resistant HIV and it has emerged as a front line therapy against
HIV/AIDS. However, current treatment modalities are far from ideal as an effective long-term
treatment option. Based upon X-ray crystal structures of complexes of darunavir or other PIs with
HIV-1 protease, we designed and developed diverse classes of potent PIs with marked antiviral
activity, and excellent drug-resistance profiles against multidrug-resistant HIV-1 strains. We have
also developed tools and important ‘backbone binding’ design concepts to combat drug-
resistance. Several recent inhibitors, have consistently shown marked improvement of potency
compared to darunavir against a panel of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants. These PIs also
exhibited much improvement of dimerization inhibitory properties of HIV-1 protease. One of these
PIs have potently inhibited integrase function. In our current proposed studies we plan to focus
on optimization of the next generation of PIs for clinical development. Our multidisciplinary
research efforts integrate structure-based design, synthesis, protein-ligand X-ray crystallography,
inhibition kinetics, in-depth virus and cell-biology and pharmacological studies."
10873061,"Blood coagulation enzymes function efficiently only on membranes containing phosphatidylserine.
However, phosphatidylserine is not ordinarily available because blood cells sequester it on the interior of
cell membranes. Blood platelets respond to collagen in injured tissue, exposing abundant
phosphatidylserine on bleb-like protrusions of the membrane and these platelets have been called
“procoagulant platelets” and are thought to be essential for prevention of bleeding. However, recent
clinical information from patients with platelet phosphatidylserine-exposing defects indicate that these
patients have only mild-moderate bleeding from mucous membranes. This raises the question as to
whether platelet phosphatidylserine exposure is, indeed, a critical component of blood coagulation.
 Preliminary studies from our laboratory have identified several factors that may help to explain
the apparent contradiction. First, blood coagulation complexes recognize convex membrane curvature in
addition to phosphatidylserine content. A membrane with protrusions and invaginations may have
coagulation complexes highly localized to the convex protrusions. Second, platelets and endothelial cells
have modes of limited membrane phosphatidylserine exposure. In these modes, phosphatidylserine
exposure is below the threshold of detection for most phosphatidylserine assays. Thus, low level
phosphatidylserine exposure is present and can support coagulation complexes, yet goes undetected.
Third, phosphatidylserine-rich membranes also support anticoagulant proteins to a degree that can
suppress or eliminate the procoagulant potential. The net anticoagulant effect, like procoagulant support,
is dependent on both phosphatidylserine content and on membrane curvature. These insights, and the
methods used to gain them, give us the unique opportunity to study the manner in which platelet and
endothelial cell phosphatidylserine exposure localizes procoagulant enzyme activity.
 We have hypothesized that blood anticoagulants ordinarily suppress the procoagulant potential of
stimulated platelets with phosphatidylserine-rich blebs. The platelets gain true procoagulant activity in
environments where anticoagulants are attenuated or bypassed by proteins in the micro-environment.
This proposal will focus on gaining insight into the anticoagulant proteins that ordinarily suppress blood
coagulation reactions on procoagulant complexes, particularly in regard to phosphatidylserine exposure
and membrane curvature. We will next probe the extent to which the anticoagulants effect is attenuated
or bypassed by the effects of plasmin in the context of mucous membranes. In addition, we will study the
manner in which conditioned endothelial support limited blood coagulation reactions on focal, highly
complex membrane projections. We will also evaluate the extent to which the endothelial procoagulant
activity may be amplified by adherent platelets and whether the endothelial generated factor Xa bypasses
anticoagulant activity on platelet blebs.
 The platelet studies will provide insights relevant to treating surgical and traumatic bleeding,
relevant to hemostasis for hemophilia patients. The endothelial studies are relevant to the coagulopathy
known as disseminated intravascular coagulation and relevant to the vascular injury and inflammation of
COVID-19."
10871813,"Diarrhea is the hallmark symptom of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Recurring diarrheal episodes not only
significantly affect treatment options, but also the quality of life of the US veteran patients with IBD. IBD
associated diarrhea results from a decrease in luminal NaCl and water absorption as well as derangements in
barrier integrity. Major route of NaCl absorption in the human intestine involves concerted operation of Na+/H+
and Cl-/HCO3- exchangers. SLC26A3 or DRA (Down-Regulated in Adenoma) is the key transporter involved in
intestinal Cl- absorption. DRA knockout mice have been shown to exhibit diarrheal phenotype resembling human
CLD (congenital chloride diarrhea) and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked the
dysregulated DRA expression to IBD pathogenesis. Further, we have recently demonstrated that DRA deficiency
in mice enhances intestinal permeability and compromises barrier integrity. Thus, DRA has emerged as an
important novel target for intervention in diarrheal disorders and IBD. Therefore, it is vital to characterize
molecular mechanisms involved in DRA regulation in health and disease and to identify agents that can activate
DRA and/or counteract its downregulation. In this regard, glucocorticoids (GCs) are important anti-inflammatory
agents and are first line therapeutics for the induction of remission in IBD. Also, GCs have been shown to stabilize
epithelial barrier function and exert antidiarrheal effects by restoring electrolyte and water absorption in
chronically inflamed epithelium. However, to date, the direct effects of GCs on DRA expression and chloride
absorption have not been investigated. Our current preliminary data provide strong evidence that synthetic GC
such as Dexamethasone (DEX) via glucocorticoid receptor (GR) can increase DRA expression via transcriptional
activation. DEX treatment also increased DRA expression in mouse intestine. Therefore, we hypothesized that
DEX exerts antidiarrheal effects by upregulating DRA expression and chloride absorption. Also, in light
of our preliminary data demonstrating a key role of DRA in intestinal barrier integrity, we further hypothesized
that DEX mediated upregulation of DRA will not only ameliorate diarrhea but will also restore epithelial
barrier integrity. The current application is, therefore, designed to investigate the mechanisms of regulation of
DRA gene expression by DEX, role of GR receptor and the associated co-activators under normal and
inflammatory conditions utilizing both in-vitro cell culture, ex-vivo human apical-out enteroids, and in-vivo mouse
models including DRA-KO mice and mice with intestine specific deletion of GR. The Specific Aims are: 1.
Elucidate the mechanisms of DEX-induced transcriptional regulation of DRA expression and function and its role
in counteracting inhibitory effects of TNF- on DRA gene expression; 2. Elucidate the mechanisms underlying
DRA up-regulation by DEX in-vivo utilizing wild type and intestine specific GR knockout mice; and 3. Examine
the role of DEX in DRA upregulation as a novel therapeutic approach in reversal of diarrhea and restoration of
barrier integrity in mice with experimental colitis. Our proposed studies will yield mechanistic information vital for
a better understanding of the mechanisms of regulation of DRA function and expression by GCs such as DEX
and are of critical importance in advancing our knowledge to develop newer and better therapeutic tools to
improve the health of veterans."

Characterized by chronic skin inflammation, atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic illness of
childhood and is often a lifelong disease. Numerous immune cell types have been implicated in AD
pathogenesis, including mast cells, basophils, and T helper type 2 (Th2) cells. Recent studies by the Kim Lab
identified group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) as critical contributors to development of AD/AD-like disease
through production of the type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. Indeed, blockade of the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor (IL-
4R) has emerged as the first FDA-approved targeted therapy for moderate-to-severe AD. Despite this major
advance, <40% of AD patients in phase III clinical trials met the primary endpoint in terms of disease
improvement. Development of new AD therapies is hindered by an incomplete understanding of the immune
cell types that regulate the disease beyond type 2 immune cells. There is an urgent need to correct this
knowledge gap to develop effective therapies for AD. Our long-term goal is to target immune regulators of AD
to develop new therapies. The overall objective of our proposal is to identify the immune cell types and effector
mechanisms that regulate AD-like disease. Our central hypothesis is that circulating natural killer (NK) cells are
major regulators of type 2 inflammation in the skin that can be harnessed to treat AD. NK cells have been
implicated in antitumor and antiviral immunity through their production of cytolytic proteins as well as interferon-
gamma (IFN-). Recent studies suggest that NK cells may negatively regulate ILC2s in the lung, but the role of
NK cells in the skin and AD remains unclear. In preliminary studies, we revealed that mouse NK cells critically
suppress skin ILC2 responses in vivo. In humans, we identified that circulating blood NK cells are markedly
deficient in moderate-to-severe AD and increase with disease resolution. The rationale for this proposal is that
once it is understood how NK cells influence AD pathogenesis, these mechanisms can be harnessed to create
effective and novel AD therapies."

An eradicative HIV cure requires safe and effective clearance of replication competent virus from all reservoirs,
including the brain. Characterization of the CNS reservoir and empiric testing of novel cure strategies require
physiologically relevant animal models of HIV persistence in the brain. Here, we propose to integrate major
advances from our groups in SHIV NHP models and AAV-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 editing to delineate key
features of the CNS reservoir and determine the efficacy of CRISPR-based eradication in the brain.
Transmitted/founder (TF) SHIVs, which encode minimally adapted TF HIV-1 Envs, represent a major advance
in biologically relevant NHP models. TF SHIVs have demonstrated robust replication in rhesus macaques, with
viral kinetics, cell tropism, and pathogenesis that mirror HIV-1 infection of humans. Further, they recently been
shown to faithfully recapitulate virus – host interactions, persist through suppressive ART, and rebound with
similar kinetics and clonality as HIV-1. Here, we will employ a novel, genetically barcoded TF SHIV model of
CNS pathogenesis and persistence, based on TF SHIV.D.191859 (SHIV.D), which encodes a clade D TF HIV-
1 Env that is CCR5-tropic, efficiently replicates in CD4 T cells and monocyte-derived macrophages, and
demonstrates consistent CNS replication, pathogenesis and persistence. Using this barcoded TF SHIV.D model
CNS persistence, we will test a novel all-in-one AAV9-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system. A recent
first-in nonhuman-primate study of SIV-infected rhesus macaques demonstrated the tolerability and efficacy of
this approach. The AAV9-CRISPR-Cas9 was broadly distributed across tissues, leading to cleavage and
excision of the SIV genome and substantial reductions in the size of the proviral reservoir across tissues. Notably,
the AAV was well distributed within CNS resulting in excision of provirus across brain regions. In this application,
we will leverage advances in the macrophage-tropic barcoded SHIV.D model and AAV-delivered CRISPR/Cas9
editing to gain insight on CNS neuropathogenesis and persistence. Our hypothesis is that by (i) characterizing
SHIV.D persistence in key CNS cells and tissues, (ii) optimizing AAV-delivered CRISPR-Cas9 approaches for
SHIV.D persistence in the brain, and (iii) testing the effects of global and myeloid-targeting CRISPR approaches
on CNS reservoir reduction in vivo, we will advance prospects for eradicating HIV from the brain. If this
hypothesis is affirmed, the significance to HIV cure field would be substantial, since it would improve our
understanding of the CNS reservoir, develop a robust model for HIV pathogenesis and persistence in the brain,
and provide key pre-clinical data on the safety and efficacy of a promising CRISPR-based cure strategy."

 Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) are an exciting and promising new class of
anticancer drugs, which have been approved by the FDA for recurrent ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2
mutations, and as maintenance therapy after frontline therapy for platinum sensitive ovarian cancer regardless
of BRCA mutation. PARPi selectively kill BRCA1/2-deficient cancer cells through synthetic lethality. However,
patients receiving PARPi eventually develop cancer progression, and acquired PARP inhibitor resistance
remains a clinical hurdle. One of the mechanisms underlying acquired PARPi resistance is the restoration of
DNA repair capacity, mainly through the secondary mutations of BRCA1/2. Our preliminary study has
demonstrated that PARPi can enhance the Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in ovarian cancer cells,
mainly through inducing expression of ALDH1A1, an isoform of the ALDH family. In addition, we also found that
ALDH1A1 is able to augment the microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), one of the pathways for repairing
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), enhance the expression of DNA polymerase θ (Pol θ), a key player in the
MMEJ pathway, as well as reduce the sensitivity of BRCA2 mutated ovarian cancer cells to PARPi. Based on
this scientific premise, we generate a hypothesis that PARPi-induced overexpression of ALDH1A1 enhances
MMEJ via increasing the expression of Pol θ, and promotes cell survival after PARPi treatment in HR-deficient
cancer cells, eventually leading to acquired PARPi resistance. Consequently, inhibition of ALDH1A1 should be
able to synergize with PARPi in treating HR-deficient EOC, and reverse resistance to PARPi in HR-deficient
EOC. The main objective of this proposal is to determine a novel mechanism that contributes to PARPi
resistance in BRCA1/2-mutated EOC cells, and test the efficacy of targeting this mechanism in preventing and
reversing PARPi resistance in these cells. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis and achieve
our goal. In specific aim 1, we will determine the mechanism underlying PARPi-induced augmentation of MMEJ
in HR-deficient EOC cells and its contribution to PARPi resistance. In specific aim 2, we will determine the
therapeutic potential of an ALDH1A1 inhibitor, NCT-505, in preventing and reversing PARPi resistance in
BRCA1/2-mutated EOC in vitro and in vivo. It is our expectation that at the conclusion of this project, we will
have demonstrated a new mechanism contributing to the development of PARPi resistance in HR-deficient EOC.
We will have also shown the therapeutic potential of an ALDH1A1 inhibitor in treating these patients."

10831977,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The public health crisis engendered by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has fueled unprecedented
efforts to address the risk of infection and transmission among vulnerable populations, including provision of
non-congregate housing to people experiencing homelessness. The expedited implementation of housing
services also addresses one of the oldest and most entrenched contributors to health disparities—lack of
safe and stable housing. In this unique moment, we have the opportunity to examine whether swift provision
of housing at the community level mitigates the impact of COVID-19, as well as how doing so may affect the
individual, social, and structural factors that contribute to consequences of COVID-19. We propose a mixed-
methods study of Operation Safer Ground (OSG), a community-level intervention deployed to stem
COVID-19 infection among people experiencing homelessness in Alameda County, CA. Initiated in April
2020, OSG provides long-term housing to homeless people who are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection
because of age (>65 years) or chronic illness. To date, more than 1,000 people, roughly 10% of the county’s
homeless population, have entered OSG. The proposed study is a “natural experiment.” In Aim 1, we will use
document reviews and qualitative interviews with OSG participants, staff, and local public health officials to
describe the development and implementation of the program, define its operational characteristics, and
investigate contextual factors that influence outcomes for program participants. We will use the Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to structure this inquiry. In Aims 2 and 3, we will compare
individual-level outcomes over time among the intervention group (OSG clients) with outcomes among
similar non-clients in a carefully constructed comparison group, which we will create using propensity score
weighting methods. We will incorporate mediation and moderation analyses to examine mechanisms and
interactions that help explain outcomes. Data will be drawn from a county-level database called the Social
Health Information Exchange (SHIE), a centralized system that coordinates health care, housing, and social
service use by county Medicaid consumers with complex health and social needs. Approximately 8,000
homeless consumers, including all OSG participants, are represented in the SHIE. By pursuing this unique
opportunity, we will gain valuable knowledge to help improve the long-term response to the pandemic and
prepare more effectively to protect the health of vulnerable populations in future public health crises."

A major strength of the Translational Science Initiative (TSI) is conducting a collaborative study to establish and
to validate NHP models for translational research, further improving the CPRC. The proposed project will
enhance the knowledge generated in the current funding cycle. During the next funding period we will implement
the project entitled “Comparative dynamics of the reproductive microbiome in SPF and conventional rhesus
macaques through multi-omic approaches”. The microbiome shapes dynamic biological systems coordinated in
full scale environments including eukaryotic hosts and are vital for animal's health. The microbiota comprises
all the microorganisms in each body niche including Prokaryotes (Bacteria, Archaea), Eukaryotes (e.g., Protozoa
or Fungi) as well as their microbial metabolites and responses that affect the host. The increase in non-
communicable and chronic diseases in humans has been linked to urbanization and a reduction in sociability.
Changes in diet, use of antibiotics, and exposure to environmental microbes are proposed to impact human
health via the gut microbiome. We expect that changes in the microbiota among SPF and conventional macaques
occur since birth, and that future management practices altering the newborn microbiome, could help in the
development of stronger and resilient microbiome in these animals used in biomedical research. We aim to
implement this project as the applied research component for our P40 application, to add value to the resource
by creating, expanding and to advance new scientific knowledge with a translational potential. Also we propose
the continuation of the Immunology Core as a complement research support to the proposed research project
and to in-house and external scientists using the Resources funded by other NIH projects."
10912434,"PROJECT SUMMARY
G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling plays an essential role in many physiological processes and is also
involved in many human diseases, yet the mechanisms governing GPCR signaling remain poorly understood.
The goal of the proposed research is to further our mechanistic understanding of GPCR signaling. The model
GPCR receptor we study is the therapeutically relevant C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). CXCR4 signaling
is important for embryogenesis, immune function and stem cell regulation, among other functions. In addition,
CXCR4 signaling is involved in several human diseases, including cancer. CXCR4 is aberrantly expressed in
many cancers and its expression correlates with poor prognosis. This is mainly because CXCR4 signaling
contributes to metastatic disease, the reason for most cancer related deaths. Yet the mechanisms governing
CXCR4 signaling remain poorly understood. To achieve our goal, we will address two main questions: 1. What
are the biophysical and structural determinants driving GPCR signaling by β-arrestins via non-GPCR binding
partners? 2. What are the roles of PKCd and A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) in compartmentalized
heterologous regulation of GPCR signaling? To address these questions, we will mainly use cell culture models
and reconstitution assays using several complimentary integrative approaches including biophysical,
biochemical, proximity ligation, multi-labeling fluorescence confocal microscopy, live cell imaging, and signaling
assays. We believe our research is significant because we expect to define new concepts that apply broadly
across the GPCR family, which will provide an advanced explanation of the mechanisms driving GPCR signaling.
Our research hold the promise to translate new knowledge into innovative drug discovery efforts to modulate
GPCR signaling therapeutically."

Sleep disorders are pervasive, contribute to morbidity in several psychiatric disorders, and cause an annual
economic burden of $100 billion. However, despite its importance for health, the mechanisms that regulate sleep
are poorly understood. We are taking a new approach to this problem by exploiting useful features of zebrafish
to answer an important and basic question: What genetic and neuronal mechanisms regulate sleep? Sleep is
regulated by a homeostatic process that reflects internal cues of sleep need and a circadian process that is
entrained by environmental cues and restricts sleep to the appropriate time. Sleep is also directly and rapidly
regulated by a phenomenon known as masking, in which light induces wake and dark induces sleep in diurnal
animals. Factors that regulate the homeostatic process have been identified, including our recent finding that the
serotonergic raphe promote sleep homeostasis in zebrafish and mice. We also showed that melatonin is
essential for circadian regulation of sleep in zebrafish, and identified a pathway in the brain that regulates
masking. Here we build upon these discoveries to elucidate mechanisms that underlie homeostatic, circadian,
and light-dependent regulation of sleep. We will investigate these mechanisms using zebrafish, a diurnal
vertebrate with several advantages that complement rodent models, using a combination of genetic, optogenetic,
and chemogenetic perturbations coupled with high-throughput behavioral assays and whole-brain neuronal
activity monitoring with single cell resolution. In Project 1, we will identify raphe subsystems that promote sleep
homeostasis, and identify genetic and neuronal circuits that act upstream and downstream of these subsystems
in sleep control. In Project 2, we will identify melatonin receptors that mediate the sleep-promoting function of
melatonin, and also perform a screen to identify neurons through which melatonin implements circadian
regulation of sleep. Project 3 builds on our recent discovery that the hypothalamic neuropeptide prokineticin 2
suppresses both light- and dark-induced masking behavior. Similar to Project 1, we will identify genetic and
neuronal circuits that act upstream and downstream of prokineticin 2 to regulate masking. In Project 4, we will
validate a large number of human sleep disorder candidate genes that were identified by genome-wide
association studies. We will do so by leveraging zebrafish to efficiently and inexpensively generate and test many
mutant lines for sleep phenotypes. We will determine the mechanisms through which validated candidate genes
regulate sleep, and integrate these genes into the pathways identified in Projects 1-3. The homeostatic (Project
1), circadian (Project 2) and light-dependent (Project 3) mechanisms that regulate sleep, as well as the sleep
disorder genes identified in humans and validated in zebrafish (Project 4), are likely to be integrated at multiple
levels to produce either sleep or wakefulness. This research program provides a unified platform to explore
interactions between genes and neurons identified in each project. This will allow us to derive a comprehensive
understanding of mechanisms that regulate sleep, and will set the stage for novel therapies for sleep disorders."

Young pregnant women are at extremely high risk for acquiring HIV in late pregnancy and postpartum. Although
the precise mechanisms to explain the high risk of HIV during this time period is unknown, highly diverse vaginal
microbial communities and elevated genital inflammation have been associated with increased HIV susceptibility
among non-pregnant women. A balanced maternal inflammatory milieu and a Lactobacillus dominated vaginal
microbial communities have long been associated with optimal pregnancy outcomes. However, untimely or
excessive inflammatory response or diverse microbial communities in the vagina can lead to adverse birth
outcomes and/or HIV acquisition in at risk women. With heightened risk of HIV in pregnancy and postpartum,
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is increasingly being used during these periods but the effects of maternal
PrEP use on child health outcomes remains underexplored. Here, we propose to use two unique cohorts of HIV-
uninfected pregnant women and their infants from Umlazi, KwaZulu-Natal, including those actively taking PrEP,
to better understand their risk factors for adverse birth outcomes and HIV acquisition as well as neonatal
morbidity. The specific aims are to: 1) assess whether vaginal microbial taxa or cytokines during gestation predict
risk of preterm labor and delivery in women at high risk for HIV. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and multiplex bead
arrays will be used to characterize the composition of vaginal microbial communities and soluble biomarkers of
genital inflammation in cervicovaginal swabs and SoftCup fluids collected from women at ~12.5-21.5 weeks’
gestation and relate these to incident preterm labor and delivery; 2) determine whether increased vaginal
microbial diversity and/or inflammation could explain the higher HIV risk during late pregnancy and early
postpartum. Microbial communities and cytokines from cervicovaginal swabs and SoftCup fluids collected at 14-
28 weeks’ gestation will be compared with those collected late pregnancy (38–40 weeks’ gestation) and 14 and
26 weeks postpartum to identify potential drivers of increased susceptibility HIV infection during these periods;
and 3) to determine the effects of antiretroviral exposure during gestation and breastfeeding on infant glucose
metabolism and innate immunity. Using samples collected from HIV-unexposed infants at 6 weeks and 12
months of age, plasma adipokine and cytokine levels and markers of insulin resistance will be compared in
antiretroviral (ARV)-exposed versus unexposed infants. The proposed research is innovative and will, for the
first time, determine whether specific vaginal anaerobic microbes and associated inflammation can predict which
women will deliver preterm or acquire HIV in our setting. Further, unique cohorts are available to examine the
immunological and metabolic effects of maternal ARV use during pregnancy on infant health without HIV
exposure, to inform risk-benefit analyses of maternal PrEP. This study has the potential to lead to more refined
interventions to mitigate risks of adverse birth outcomes, HIV acquisition and neonatal morbidity."
10774297,"Bladder cancer (BLCa) is the 4th most common cancer and the 7th most deadly in male
veterans. Almost all cancer deaths are caused by advanced bladder cancer (aBC) which is the
focus of this collaborative study. Patients with aBC usually receive medical treatment which
includes chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy, and, in case of locally advanced
bladder cancer, radical cystectomy. Medical treatment is at most moderately effective. The goal
of this collaborative application is to improve the treatment outcomes of aBC through revamping
all four therapies from three complementary research teams with expertise in basic science,
translational research, medical oncology and urology. We hypothesize that the prognosis and
patient quality of life in aBC can be improved through optimizing all therapeutic modalities from
research teams with complementary expertise.
 Specific Aims of BLRD Collaborative Merit Review Award: Three highly integrated
research projects are designed to optimize three medical therapies and subsequently can further
improve surgical treatment for aBC: Project #1 is to use non-toxic oral compounds to overcome
chemoresistance and enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy by cytotoxic-autophagy; Project #2
is to develop oral cancer-specific quadra-functional local immuno-theranostic platform to enhance
cancer immunotherapy, eliminate the associated immune-mediated toxicity in addition to its
diagnostic potential; Project #3 is to target our newly identified ARID1A-PI3K pathways and
develop novel more effective targeted therapy for aBC.
 Epigenetic modifying genes are mutated in almost 90% of aBC, and 20% have truncating
mutations that result in the inactivation of AT Rich Interactive Domain 1A (ARID1A), a chromatin
modifier. With funding from a VA RDA grant, we previously showed that ARID1A deficient (def)
BLCa is dependent on PI3K signaling via upregulation of a relatively uncharacterized regulatory
PI3K subunit PIK3R3 and downregulation of MAPK signaling. We showed that: 1) ARID1Adef
cells are sensitive to EZH2 inhibitors due to dependence on PI3K signaling, and upregulation of
an endogenous PI3K inhibitory protein PIK3IP1, 2) upregulation of PIK3IP1 was necessary and
sufficient for cell death in ARID1Adef cells, and 3) PIK3R3 upregulation was necessary and
sufficient for PI3K/AKT pathway activation and increased tumor growth. We used these data to
support a phase II clinical trial with this PI as co-investigator investigating the EZH2 inhibitor
Tazemetostat as maintenance therapy in metastatic bladder cancer patients with ARID1A mutant
tumors. These data underscore the central hypothesis of this proposal that ARID1A deficient
bladder cancer is transcriptionally re-wired to expose pharmacologic vulnerabilities that can be
exploited with personalized therapies to improve outcomes for veterans and patients with bladder
cancer. We will test this hypothesis in three Aims:
 Aim 1: Elucidate the molecular mechanisms leading to PI3K/AKT pathway
 dependence in ARID1Adef cells.
 Aim 2: Elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which PIK3IP1 inhibits PI3K
signaling.
 Aim 3: Investigate the sensitivity of ARID1Adef bladder cancer to PI3K/AKT
 inhibitors and immunotherapy."

This proposal outlines a five-year training program for Dr. Mark Lee, M.D., Ph.D., with the goal of preparing him
for an independent academic research career as a physician-scientist. Dr. Lee completed doctoral studies in
immunology at Harvard Medical School as part of the combined M.D./Ph.D. program, and is currently an
Instructor at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a board-certified Transfusion Medicine physician. Dr. Lee’s
career development plan will build on his background in human immunology, adding didactic training and primary
research experiences in computational oncology and cancer research. In this effort, Dr. Lee will be mentored by
Dr. Matthew Meyerson, who is an international leader in lung cancer genomics and has a history of mentoring
physician-scientists who have transitioned to independent academic research positions, as well as a Scientific
Advisory Committee composed of highly regarded physician-scientists (Dr. Eliezer Van Allen, Dr. Marcela Maus,
and Dr. David Barbie) who have expertise in computational oncology, cancer immunology, and cancer biology.
The outstanding research environment and facilities available to Dr. Lee include laboratory space at both Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute and the Broad Institute. In addition, using extensive career development resources within
the Harvard-affiliated hospital system, Dr. Lee will further develop critical career skills in scientific leadership,
laboratory management, research communication, and grant writing. The long-term goal of the proposed
research is to apply novel technologies to identify the targets of tumor-reactive T cells within cancer genomes,
in order to fundamentally understand immune responses in cancer patients and to therapeutically augment these
responses. Although immunotherapy – and in particular, immune checkpoint blockade – has revolutionized
treatment for select patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the majority of patients fail to respond.
Thus, increasing the efficacy of immunotherapy for non-responders remains a critical priority of cancer research.
T cell-based therapies, including adoptive cellular therapies and T cell receptor (TCR) bispecific proteins, have
led to major pathologic responses in cancer patients, including in non-responders to checkpoint blockade.
However, the currently limited set of well-defined tumor-reactive TCRs – and the technical difficulty of identifying
tumor antigen/TCR pairs – currently restricts the number of NSCLC patients that can be treated with these novel
therapies. Dr. Lee recently developed a high-throughput method that allows functional testing of thousands of
putative T cell targets, and will apply this method to identify the targets of T cell receptors in NSCLC patient
tumor and blood specimens. Successful completion of this project will enable a more complete understanding of
the cellular markers that enrich for tumor-reactive T cells (Aim 1) and a more complete understanding of how
tumor-reactive T cells in the peripheral blood respond to PD-1 blockade (Aim 2). Together with formal training,
the proposed research will allow Dr. Lee to launch an independent career as an academic physician-scientist."

 The present application proposes a developmental research plan to investigate the structure-function
relationship of individual presynaptic complexes in mammalian vestibular hair cells. These complexes
incorporate synaptic ribbons that can exhibit broad architectural heterogeneity, the functional significance of
which is not known. The distribution of presynaptic architectures in the primary hair cell phenotypes (i.e. types I
and II) within vestibular epithelia, and the unique dendritic specialization known as the calyx (encapsulating type
I hair cells), render traditional methods of investigating synaptic function inappropriate for elucidating the
functional characteristics of individual synaptic sites. Recent advances in the development of optical biosensors
and viral transduction strategies provide the foundation for novel capabilities to detect and quantify
neurotransmitter release at individual synapses. iGluSnFR is a genetically encoded, membrane bound
glutamate sensor. When expressed at the postsynaptic membrane, it emits a fluorescent signal proportional to
glutamate release. Recent key investigations demonstrated that when packaged with an AAV9 capsid and a
synapsin promoter, inner ear afferent neurons are transduced and iGluSnFR is expressed. This strategy directs
the sensor to the appropriate postsynaptic targets for measuring glutamate release from individual hair cell
synapses. When coupled with strategies for post-recording elucidation of synaptic ribbons an association
between glutamate release and synapse structure can be made. The project includes three Aims to: 1) optimize
transduction in vestibular afferent neurons; 2) develop and optimize recording strategies to capture the time-
resolved glutamate release from individual synaptic sites; and 3) evaluate the methods in a mouse model for
which presynaptic function in type I hair cells is drastically attenuated. Immunohistochemical processing
following optical recording will enable the direct association of immunolabeled ribbons with the recording sites,
for which ribbon volume provides a proxy of its architecture. The development of these methods provides the
foundation future studies of pathologic conditions whose etiologies are proposed to involve synaptopathies. This
investigation will enable future investigations of synaptic function in normal and pathologic conditions, and
provide a platform for the rigorous evaluation of novel treatments of inner ear dysfunction."

Traditional social norms marketing campaigns (SNMCs), which seek to reinforce risk-reducing accurate
campus drinking norms via posters, have been a staple at universities for over two decades despite difficulties
in assessing campaign exposure, and boomerang effects associated with psychological reactance among heavy
drinkers. Further, exposure to alcohol content on Instagram and Snapchat has been shown to undermine
traditional normative re-education programs. Recent efforts have successfully drawn on the emerging
gamification literature to bolster student motivation and attention, decrease reactance, and thereby increase
the efficacy and real-world utility of one-dose personalized normative feedback (PNF). This proposal leverages
game mechanics identified in our previous projects to innovatively modernize SNMCs, which are universal
(campus-wide) and typically employed alongside psycho-educational and PNF interventions. Further, we plan
to utilize posts on Instagram and Snapchat to adapt the mode of delivery to specifically combat social media
(SM)-based alcohol influence. This innovative use of SM posts to deliver a SNMC game has the added benefit of
meeting students where they are (on Instagram and Snapchat) and is less resource-intensive than in-person,
online, and app-based norms intervention strategies. Additionally, this project will utilize targeted ads, which
are paid versions of posts, to innovatively addresses several limitations associated with traditional SNMCs,
such as an inability to conduct RCTs to evaluate the effectiveness of these campaigns within a campus and a
reliance on self-report to assess exposure to the campaign. The proposed project has two phases: (1)
development of the gamified SNMC, 2 College Truths & 1 Lie (2T1L) (Phase 1), and (2) a hybrid feasibility and
efficacy pilot RCT (Phase 2). 2T1L involves participants identifying an incorrect norm from a list of three
“facts” about first-year students; the game then corrects the misperceived norm and reinforces the correction
with graphics. Each round will include risk-reducing alcohol norms, either as truths or lies. 2T1L also included
features like points and leaderboards that increase interest, engagement, and believability, especially among
heavy drinkers who tend to be reactive to norms re-education. Participatory research methods will also be
employed to produce 2T1L to maximize appeal and relevance to first-year students. In Year 1, we will conduct a
norms documentation survey (N=400) to determine game norms (Aim 1a), and focus groups (N=50) to
identify game aesthetics preferred by first-year students (Aim 1b). In the beginning of year 2, we will conduct a
second set of focus groups (N=50) to test the 2T1L game and receive feedback to improve user experience of
2T1L prior to launch (Aim 1c). Phase 1 will culminate in a finalized version of the 2T1L SNMC to be evaluated
by a hybrid feasibility and efficacy pilot RCT (N=414) in Phase 2. Short- and long-term effects of the 2T1L

10813748,"Abstract
There is substantial evidence that psychopathology is structured hierarchically. In addition to two major specific
factors, internalizing and externalizing, there is a single overarching general factor, the “P factor”, that explains
a sizable share of variance in psychiatric symptoms. The P factor model represents a major recent advance in
our understanding of the architecture of psychopathology. However, there is a critical gap in our current
knowledge: We have little understanding of the neurodevelopmental etiological factors that produce the P
factor during youth.
We have an ideal opportunity to address this gap with the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)
longitudinal study (n=11,875; 4 biennial waves of data over the course of this five-year grant). We have
formulated a Dual Dysmaturation Model in which the P factor arises from altered maturation during
adolescence in two systems: executive control systems (leading to globally reduced higher-order cognition and
inhibitory control) and impulse generation systems (leading to globally elevated impulse generation). We have
also undertaken a comprehensive analysis of psychopathology data in ABCD to derive and validate a
superordinate general psychopathology factor (“P factor”). Our overarching aim in this project is to build on
these results and delineate the multi-factor etiology of the P factor in youth in ABCD, integrating knowledge
across socio-environmental, psychological, neural, and genetic levels of analysis.
More specifically we seek to achieve four aims. Aim 1 uses a latent growth modeling approach to quantify co-
development of psychological variables (including executive functions, negative emotions, and aggressive
impulses) with the emergence of the P factor over adolescence. In Aim 2, we use advanced methods to
fractionate brain imaging maps into a small number of cohesive components. We then use latent growth
modeling to identify brain components that co-develop with the P factor. For Aim 3, we delineate genetic
factors that contribute to the P factor. For this aim, we identify brain components that mediate the relationship
between polygenic risk for the P factor and the emergence of the P factor in late adolescence. For the Aim 4,
we integrate the preceding factors (psychological, neural, and genetic) with additional socio-environmental
variables to build an overall nomological network for the emergence of the P factor, and we distinguish this
network from analogous networks for the emergence of internalizing and externalizing specific factors.
By bringing together the seminal ABCD dataset and advanced multivariate multi-modal neuroimaging methods,
this project will give us important new mechanistic insights into the multi-factor neurodevelopmental etiology of
the P factor. This knowledge is a key input to downstream research programs, such as programs that seek to
identify high-risk youth or to develop interventions that mitigate or block the emergence of psychopathology."
10796989,"Americans of low socioeconomic status (SES) are less healthy than those of high SES. Understanding the
causes of these health disparities is one of the most important research questions social scientists face today.
 I propose to investigate an understudied cause of such health disparities: economic uncertainty. Income
volatility has been rising in the US, making it an increasingly important source of economic uncertainty. For 92
percent of Americans, having financial stability is more important than moving up the income ladder. The income
swings are often unpredictable, making them impossible for families to anticipate and prepare accordingly. When
income dips, low-SES families, who often lack a cushion of savings, may struggle to make ends meet.
 The prospect of this scenario of financial distress may cause anxiety, worry, and stress. The anticipation and
concern about an aversive and uncertain event can cause anxiety and worry while the uncertainty about how
one might cope if the event occurs may cause stress. According to the allostatic load framework, the stress
increases the risks of cardiovascular disease and of age-related metabolic diseases, promotes cognitive decline
and dementia, and accelerates cellular aging.
 I propose to analyze the relationship between income volatility, psychological health, and physiological aging.
This project is interdisciplinary. I am an economist and can analyse and measure income volatility. However, I
lack the skills to conceptualize and measure anxiety, worry, and stress; to understand the biological processes
through which uncertainty and stress may accelerate aging; and to know how to use biomarkers to measure
physiological aging. The K01 will provide training – under the guidance of two outstanding mentors and an expert
advisory committee – that will give me such skills. My mentors, Profs. Arthur Stone and Eileen Crimmins, are
leading experts in the areas where I need training and have experience in mentoring K01 awardees. The award
will provide protected time for me to develop this agenda. The specific aims of this proposal are to:
 1) Measure the extent of income volatility and document how it is distributed in the population.
 2) Investigate the relationship between income volatility and psychological health.
 3) Examine the relationship between income volatility and physiological aging.
 4) Study populations at risk, such as those without a buffer of savings.
 My long-term career goal is to become an expert on how economic uncertainty affects health and aging. I
am confident that this sustained period of career development and training will enable me to launch an
independent research career and emerge as a leading researcher in this area."
10800689,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In all domains of life, decoding of the genetic information into peptides is accomplished by the ribosome,
which reads the messenger RNA (mRNA) three nucleotides at a time. Following careful selection of the
aminoacyl-tRNA that matches this triplet codon, the ribosome must precisely move to reading the next codon.
Precise translocation is not an easy task given the multiple coordinated movements of the mRNA, tRNA and
the ribosomal subunits that must occur. Failure to do so results in so-called frameshifting errors, which are
detrimental to proteostasis as they result in errant protein products that bear no resemblance to the encoded
ones. Notably, much of what we know about reading-frame maintenance comes from studies on programmed
or “intentional” frameshifting. These studies revealed that sequence and structural features of the mRNA and
its interaction with elements of the ribosome, translation factors and the tRNA contribute to these events.
Although many of these elements are unique to each mRNA, almost all frameshifting events rely on ribosome
stalling. Cellular response to stalls has been almost exclusively in the context of quality control and ribosome
rescue. In particular, stalls are recognized by ubiquitin ligases when they cause ribosome collisions. In
principle, colliding ribosomes can also provide structural impediments required for frameshifting; indeed, we
recently showed that collisions can lead to efficient +1 frameshifting, suggesting that cells must have evolved
factors to maintain reading frame during translation stalls. As ribosomes appear to stall frequently under
stress, these mechanisms are more than likely to become critical for cell survival and recovery. This proposal
is focused on one recently identified mechanism that involves the highly conserved multi-protein bridging
factor (Mbf1). Our preliminary studies suggest that the factor prevents collision-mediated +1 frameshifting.
This, together with a preliminary cyoEM structure of a Mbf1-bound ribosome, forms the basis of our major
hypothesis that Mbf1 recognizes collided ribosomes to prevent them from altering the reading frame of the
leading one. We will test this hypothesis through three aims. In the first one, we will assess how altering
ribosome density and mRNA-sequence and -structural features modulate the function of Mbf1 in an effort to
establish a relationship between ribosome collisions and frameshifting. In the second aim, using modified
ribosome-profiling approaches to assess frameshifting transcriptome-wide, we will dissect the role of Mbf1
in preventing frameshifting occurring at stochastic collisions as well as those experienced under stress. In
the third aim, the mechanism of Mbf1 recruitment to stalled ribosomes will be studied using a battery of
biochemical and biophysical approaches. We are most interested in investigating how the factor alters the
function and the structure of the translation machinery. Collectively, our interdisciplinary approach builds and
expands on established expertise and resources, which we plan to use to uncover important details about
how conserved factors are recruited to ribosomes to modulate their function under stress."

Project Summary: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases
worldwide. The pathogenic mechanism remains incompletely understood. Bile acids (BAs) are endocrine
hormones that are important for the biological processes. Dysregulation of BA metabolism may cause
cholestasis, liver cancer, NAFLD, etc. Activation of BA receptors FXR and TGR5 has been shown to protect
against NAFLD in mice and clinical trials. Transmembrane protein 141 (TMEM141) belongs to the TMEM protein
family that consists of proteins of mostly unknown functions. So far, nothing is known about the biological
functions of TMEM141. In this project, we plan to investigate the role of hepatic TMEM141 in the pathogenesis
of NAFLD. We will investigate whether and how hepatic TMEM141 regulates the development of NAFLD and
bile acid metabolism, and how hepatic TMEM141 expression is regulated in NAFLD. We will use a number of
genetically modified mice and a complementary approach to accomplish our goals."
10769863,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The multiple tissue compartments or niches in the respiratory system display varying abilities to repair and
regenerate after acute injury or in chronic disease states. The alveolar niche is critical for gas exchange as well
as acting as a sentinel for environmental stimuli including infectious organisms and pollutants. Much of the
regenerative power of the alveoli rests within the alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell, which is not only critical for surfactant
production and innate immune responses, but also harbors the resident progenitor cell population. A building
body of research has shown that subsets of AT2 cells can proliferate and differentiate into alveolar type 1 (AT1)
cells after acute injury, which is critical for regenerating functional alveoli. These AT2 cells behaviors are
regulated by signaling, transcriptional, and epigenetic mechanisms that have only recently started to be
elucidated. To further our understanding of the role that epigenetic pathways play in lung alveolar regeneration,
we performed a small molecule screen using an alveolar organoid assay to identify pathways that promote
alveolar repair and regeneration. This screen identified multiple inhibitors of the Disruptor of Telomeric Silencing-
1 like (Dot1L) that regulate alveolar organoid size. Dot1L is the sole enzyme which is known to methylate H3K79
(H3K79me1/2/3 marks), and Dot1L has been demonstrated to play critical roles in promoting pluripotent stem
cell reprogramming, and cellular responses to injury and tissue regeneration. Our data show that Dot1L inhibition
increases alveolar organoid size in a dose dependent manner. To better understand the role of Dot1L in lung
development and regeneration in vivo, we generated a Dot1L conditional knockout mouse allele and inactivated
Dot1L during lung development and in multiple models of lung injury and regeneration. Loss of Dot1L during
lung endoderm development results in the loss of H3K79 methylation and premature or enhanced expression of
AT1 and AT2 marker genes, suggesting acceleration of AT1 and AT2 cell differentiation. In two models of lung
alveolar regeneration, loss of Dot1L in AT2 cells results in dramatic acceleration of AT2-AT1 differentiation after
lung injury. Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) combined with ChIP-seq analysis reveals that loss of Dot1L leads
to the emergence of a new AT2 cell state characterized by a dramatic increase in the expression of the important
transcriptional regulators Id1 and Id2 as well as an overall increase in expression of metabolism genes related
to oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Taken together, our data lead to the hypothesis that Dot1L plays an
important role in regulating lung alveolar responses to acute lung injury by regulating the lineage barrier between
AT2 and AT1 cells via de-repression of the critical transcriptional regulators Id1/Id2 and a switch to OxPhos
metabolism, resulting in acceleration of AT2-AT1 differentiation."

DNA-directed RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is one of the most important molecules in biology. Pol II is highly-
conserved among eukaryotic organisms and plays a fundamental role in cellular life; specifically, the
transcription of genes into messenger RNA. Structural studies of Pol II have been very successful and have
allowed snapshots of Pol II in its apo form, in the process of initiation and elongation, during backtracking or
paused by DNA lesions. Moreover, single particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of Pol II in complex
with the general transcription factors (preinitiation complex), and with elongation factors have provided
views of the complexities of the initiation and elongation steps of transcription. A molecular picture of the
role that individual factors play during transcription initiation and elongation is beginning to emerge and has
generated tremendous progress towards our understanding of gene processing and regulation. Conversely,
the molecular details of nucleotide addition and the roles of conformational changes by conserved and
essential domains such as the so called “trigger loop” or “bridge helix” in substrate selection and catalysis
are not fully understood. Furthermore, pioneering studies are at lower resolution and miss critical
information to inform a complete enzymatic mechanism. This project, through extensive technology
development and innovation in structural approaches to Pol II, describes the foundation to reveal the active
site rearrangements within Pol II leading to catalysis and subsequent translocation. The studies proposed
employ a combination of state of the art technologies including time resolved X-ray crystallography, free
electron laser and single particle cryo-electron microscopy experiments to elucidate the time evolution of the
molecular events during Pol II transcriptional elongation. Importantly, orthogonal approaches are developed
to validate results from multiple independent methodologies. The Pol II system represents a model for all
cellular RNA polymerases and results obtained will represent foundational models with which Pol I, Pol III,
and prokaryotic RNA polymerases may be compared. Insight into the Pol II catalytic mechanism and
determination of how activity-altering mutants alter it will provide the framework for understanding ho
regulatory factors that target the Pol II active site might work."

Neuroene Therapeutics has discovered a novel class of well-tolerated, brain-penetrating, non-sedating
compounds that are small analogs of Vitamin K (VK) that mimic the form of VK needed for mitochondrial and
neurological health. Our VK analogs are effective in several animal models of pharmacoresistant seizures and
Parkinson's disease. Our lead antiseizure drug (ASD) candidate is fast-acting, has broad-spectrum antiseizure
activity in several pharmacoresistant seizure models, and is mitochondrial protective. Neuroene's clinical
candidate has great potential as a fast-acting rescue agent and long-term chronic therapeutic. VK analogs are
very stable in dry form at room temperature, allowing for long shelf life for stockpiling in the event of a public
health emergency or bio-incident.
Organophosphate agents (OPs) are used widely as pesticides, but are also potent nerve agents for chemical
warfare. Foreign adversaries have stockpiles of chemical weapons and have used these agents in the past. OPs
irreversibly inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. However, they have also been shown to inhibit other
pathways at low doses where acetylcholinesterase is not inhibited. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial
dysfunction occur at low OP doses, and it has been shown that OP compounds induce changes in mitochondrial
membrane potential and inhibit mitochondrial complexes needed for ATP production. While there are several
treatments for OP exposure, most have undesirable side effects and/or have a very narrow window to administer
their drug. Whereas Neuroene's clinical candidate protects against mitochondrial dysfunction, a major toxicity of
OP exposure, and does not target the mechanisms of the standard of care treatments. Neuroene's clinical
candidate has excellent tolerability in mice, and naturally occurring VK has no upper dose limit/maximum
tolerated dose. Neuroene's clinical candidate could represent a potentially superior alternative to the standard
of care for OP exposure, or as an adjuvant to the standard treatment of care, by targeting an additional
mechanism of action for OP-poisoning. Aim 1. Determine the PK properties of Neuroene's clinical candidate,
safe dosing range and maximum tolerated dose in rats. Aim 2. Determine the ability of Neuroene's clinical
candidate to ameliorate diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) SE in rats. Aim 3. Determine the ability of Neuroene's
clinical candidate to ameliorate soman poisoning in rats. Neuroene's clinical candidate is fast-acting, broad-
spectrum, and protects mitochondria. This compound could immediately stabilize and override cascading effects
due to poisoning by OPs. If successful, Neuroene's drug could be a dual-purpose ASD for acute settings and to
reduce long-term sequela associated with OP poisoning. Neuroene's clinical candidate could be made widely
available commercially to improve the United States' health security posture due our commercial indications for
pharmacoresistant seizures, while being available during a public health emergency or bio-incident"

Iatrogenic nerve injury presents one of the most feared surgical complications and a major source of morbidity
across all surgical specialties. While crucial to maintain their vital functions, preservation of cranial nerves re-
mains a major challenge in skull base surgeries. Additionally, with the increased use of minimally invasive sur-
gical approaches, difficulty with cranial nerve identification and visualization is amplified. Cranial nerves are often
intimately associated with tumors of the skull base, where surgery can be curative, but must be balanced against
injury risk. Unlike other critical tissues (e.g., blood vessels), nerve repair produces negligible, unreliable func-
tional improvement. Permanent motor or sensory disabilities and chronic neuropathies result, limiting patient
quality of life, employability and participation in daily activities. The only known method to avoid nerve injury is
to prevent its occurrence. However, no clinically approved technology sufficiently enhances intraoperative nerve
visualization, where a combination of neuroanatomical knowledge, white light visualization and neurophysiolog-
ical monitoring are currently used. This work will directly address this unmet clinical need. Fluorescence Guided
Surgery (FGS) has successfully integrated into clinical medicine with only a few FDA-approved fluorophores
(i.e., fluorescein, Aminolevulinic/Protoporphyin IX [ALA/PpIX], methylene blue and indocyanine green [ICG]).
While FGS systems for imaging outside the skull operate almost exclusively in the near infrared (NIR, 650-900
nm), imaging system for neurosurgery are commonly equipped with the ability to image in the visible. However,
all clinical FGS systems have an “800 nm” channel designed to image ICG, including neurosurgical microscopes
and wide-field exoscopes. To facilitate clinical translation and utility for neurosurgery, the overall goal herein is
to generate a nerve-specific small molecule fluorophore with spectral properties matched to ICG. This novel
probe would enable cranial nerve visualization that is spectrally distinct from the visible fluorescein and ALA/PpIX
that are commonly used for tumor enhancement, while enabling future clinical translation using existing neuro-
surgical FGS infrastructure. Development of a NIR nerve-specific probe has presented a synthetic challenge as
molecules must be small enough to cross the tight blood nerve and/or blood brain barrier(s) (BNB and/or BBB,
respectively), but with a sufficient degree of conjugation to reach NIR wavelengths. This is a particular challenge
in neurosurgical applications where identification and visualization of structures at the interface of the peripheral
and central nervous system (PNS and CNS, respectively) are required for successful surgical outcomes. In pre-
liminary work, our group has designed and developed NIR oxazine-based probes with exquisite PNS specificity
and recently discovered that a new library of oxazine probes provide BBB-cross and CNS specificity, however
an agent suitable for clinical translation does not yet exist. Herein, we will develop NIR nerve-specific fluoro-
phore(s) for identification and visualization of the cranial nerves with and without tumor counterstain (i.e., fluo-
rescein or ALA/PpIX) in animal models of meningioma and schwannoma."

As a health services researcher and Assistant Professor at Temple University, my long-term career goal is to
become a leader in preference-based, patient-centered outcomes research to inform decision making for
patients with end-stage lung disease, specifically about transplantation decisions. Clinical trials have shown that
decision aids improve the quality and efficiency of decision making, improve comprehension and decrease
decisional conflict. Despite these benefits, few decision aids have addressed the complexity of lung transplant.
A critical barrier to the development of decision aids is the inability to inform and communicate to patients and
caregivers the impact of transplant on quality of life (QoL). Thus, to address these knowledge gaps and pursue
my long-term career goals, I will investigate patient priorities for QoL outcomes in the context of lung transplant
decision making to inform the development of a decision aid. Three Specific Aims will accomplish this objective.
AIM 1: Describe priorities for QoL outcomes and their impact on decision making among patients (n=30-40) and
caregivers (n=30-40) at each phase of lung transplant, and clinicians (n=10-15). AIM 2: Measure QoL, priorities
for outcomes, and willingness to trade between quantity and quality of life among a prospective cohort of patients
(n=200) and caregivers (n=200) considering lung transplant using health-related quality of life measures, best-
worst scaling tasks, and treatment tradeoff exercises. AIM 3: Develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability
of a decision aid among patient and caregiver dyads (n=30) considering lung transplant. To accomplish these
aims, I propose a mixed method approach. Qualitative methods include semi-structured interviews conducted in
cross-sectional samples across transplant phases (Aim 1). Quantitative surveys and the feasibility/acceptability
study will be collected among patients with end-stage lung disease just starting to consider transplant, as well
as their caregivers (Aims 2 and 3). A prospective cohort will be followed over time to identify differences across
phases of decision making (Aim 2). Although I have had a productive start to my career, I require further training
to execute these Aims, accomplish these goals and achieve independence as an investigator. Specifically, I
have identified four short-term career objectives. I will: 1) lead a community-engaged research effort inclusive of
patients, caregivers and clinicians; 2) design and implement qualitative and mixed methods approaches to collect
and analyze patient experience data; 3) obtain formal training in theory of decision making, interpersonal health
communication and risk communication; and 4) acquire domain expertise to apply these skills in the context of
lung transplant. I have designed a career development plan to achieve these objectives that includes mentorship
from a highly accomplished group of researchers who are dedicated to my career development and experts in
decision making theory, decision aid design, health and risk communication, qualitative and mixed methods, and
lung transplant. These mentors have long histories of extramural funding and mentoring. In addition to mentored
instruction, I will complete didactic coursework and intensive professional trainings."

Multiple forms of muscular dystrophy are characterized by cardiac involvement which can be life-threatening,
including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and LMNA-related muscular dystrophy. These diseases are
caused by mutations in DMD and LMNA, respectively. Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in these diseases. Physiologic mechanical stress in skeletal and cardiac muscle is a main driver of
disease in these forms of muscular dystrophy. In addition, cardiac arrhythmias, disproportionate to left
ventricular dysfunction, are prominent in LMNA-related disease. New therapeutic strategies, such as exon
skipping, gene therapy, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, are in development or have been approved for these
diseases. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells can be created and differentiated into cardiomyocytes
(iPSC-CMs), offering the opportunity to study patient-specific mutations and test therapeutics in the dish.
However, iPSC-CMs are limited by tissue immaturity, non-physiologic stressors, and non-physiologic outputs.
Engineered heart tissues are created by seeding iPSC-CMs in a hydrogel matrix that is supported by flexible
posts. With these tissue constructs, a more advanced degree of cellular maturation can be achieved, and
outputs such as contraction velocity and amplitude can be readily determined. Specific Aim 1 of this K08 award
aims assess the effect of physiologic mechanical stress on iPSC-CMs. Specific Aim 2 will improve the
assessment of arrhythmogenic potential in novel engineered heart tissue constructs using patient-derived
iPSC-CMs harboring DMD and LMNA mutations. Novel therapeutics for both disease entities will be assessed.
Preliminary data is presented that demonstrates increased susceptibility of DMD iPSC-CMs to mechanical
stress and mitigation of this phenotype by a novel therapeutic. An engineered heart tissue prototype is
presented that will allow for the direct electrophysiologic interrogation of these tissues. We expect this
prototype, which will allow for more uniform pacing, will be useful, especially in characterizing novel therapeutic
effects on LMNA iPSC-CMs. This K08 will support the career development plan for the PI, Dominic Fullenkamp
MD PhD, who received his graduate training in biomedical engineering and is physician-scientist cardiologist.
Dr. Fullenkamp's long-term objective is to become an independent investigator as a physician scientist at the
interface of cardiovascular biology and engineering, and use this interface to test novel therapeutics. In
addition to the research proposed, Dr. Fullenkamp aims to use this award to further develop his training in
cardiovascular biology under the mentorship of Elizabeth McNally MD PhD and Alfred George MD, two
experienced and collaborative mentors, at Northwestern University. His development plan will be supported by
internal and external coursework and clinical activity that directly correlates with his research interests."

Significantly, we identified the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway as key to the host response to
influenza and secondary bacterial infection following influenza. We also identified High Mobility Group Box 1

multiple respiratory viruses and detected greatly elevated levels in sera from patients hospitalized for severe

influenza-induced respiratory disease that acts by stimulating TLR4/MD-2 to elicit the potent inflammatory

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in elderly. Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathologies
and neuroinflammation are three major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Vast majority of the drug discovery
efforts in the past decades have focused on targeting the Aβ pathology, but none are successful in Clinical Trials.
While tau pathology, not the Aβ pathology, has emerged to play critical role in memory decline in AD, drugs
targeting the direct effects of tau on neurons also have not met success either. Compelling human genetic studies
link the innate immune responses to elevated risk of developing late-onset AD, supporting targeting microglia,
resident immune cells in the brain, as the next-generation treatment for AD. We showed that a critical role of
cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling in microglial toxicity and
tau-mediated cognitive decline. Activation of cGAS, a major cytosolic dsDNA sensor, catalyzes production of
cGAMP, an extremely potent STING agonist as the second messenger that activates cGAS-STING pathway,
leading to a production of the antiviral responses through activation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and
expression of cytokine and type I interferon genes. We found that a partial or complete genetic cGAS ablation
protected against the tau-mediated spatial learning and memory deficits in PS19 Tau mice. Moreover, treatment
with a small molecule inhibitor of cGAS reduces interferon responses, diminished microgliosis, and protected
against cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model with tauopathy. We hypothesize that inhibitors the cGAS activity
will dampen neuroinflammation and maladaptive immune responses, protect against AD-related deficit. We
propose to develop small molecule human cGAS (h-cGAS) inhibitors as novel microglial modulators to treat AD.
In Aim 1, we will develop lead h-cGAS inhibitors starting with two known hits and determine whether these
inhibitors effectively modulate the cGAS-STING pathway in cell-free and cell-based assays. We expect to identify
new hits via hits expansion and synthesize >200 analogs. Aim 2 focuses on optimization of analogs a potent
cGAS inhibitor, TDI-6570, which is a lead low nanomolar potent mouse cGAS (m-cGAS) inhibitor and possesses
10x less h-cGAS activity. We will design up to 50 new analogs. Results of SAR, docking experiments, and in-
silico calculation will be used to maximize the lead quality. Completion of Aim 1 and Aim 2 will lead to 5 lead
compounds for in vivo and efficacy studies. In Aim 3, we will establish PK and efficacy of h-cGAS inhibitors in
mouse model of tauopathy, and efficacy in human stem cell-derived microglia and cerebral organoids with
tauopathy. At the end of the proposed 5 years study, we anticipate identifying 1-2 lead h-cGAS inhibitors as tool
compounds and a proof of principle to further advance as drug candidates to treat Alzheimer's disease and
related neurological disorders."
10839911,"Diabetes is caused by insufficient secretion of insulin and subsequent loss of glucose homeostasis 
as a result of dysfunction or death of insulin-secreting β-cells. β-cells within the 
islet do not function autonomously: extensive interactions occur between β-cells and with other 
endocrine cells that control the regulation of insulin secretion. Previously, we and others 
 established a critical role for gap-junction mediated electrical communication 
between β-cells that coordinates the dynamics of electrical activity, Ca² elevations and insulin 
release. β-cells are functionally heterogenous, yet the way in which different populations of 
β-cells influence the function of the whole islet is poorly understood. As such, the 
overall goal of our research program is to understand how islet function is determined 
by coupling between the diverse populations of β-cells. In the previous funding period, we 
discovered and characterized distinct sub-populations of β-cells within the intact islet, that can 
influence the dynamics and glucose sensitivity of whole islet electrical activity. However critical 
gaps in our understanding remain. This includes how functional sub-populations impact both first 
phase and second phase dynamics of insulin secretion; the presence and role of functional 
sub-populations in human islets; and how changes in sub-populations in diabetes impact islet 
function. To address these open questions, we have designed 3 specific aims to test our overall 
hypothesis: that populations of β-cells with distinct functional characteristics exert 
disproportionate control over multiple aspects of the islet Ca² response, via electrical 
coupling. 1) Characterize how β-cell sub-populations coordinate the initial first-phase 
response of the islet following glucose elevation; 2) Characterize the presence of 
functional sub-populations and electrical communication in human islets insitu; 3) Determine the 
gap junction dependence for functional sub-populations under healthy conditions and in type2 
diabetes. By understanding how heterogenous β-cell populations within the islet interact, we will 
gain fundamental understanding how islet electrical and insulin secretion response is regulated. 
Thus, therapeutic targets which may disproportionately influence a certain β-cell 
population may provide new ways to control the islet under pathogenic conditions."
10874452,"Tolerance to cerebral ischemia can be induced by exposure to brief ischemia or
pharmacological agents including the Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, a phenomenon known
as the ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Established evidence suggests that innate immune
pathways such as TLRs and type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling are involved in IPC-mediated
neuroprotection. Although it is well known that tolerance to ischemia or the effect of IPC
declines with age and pathological conditions including metabolic diseases, the underlying
mechanism for this damping effect is not well understood. Using single cell RNA sequencing,
we have recently found that monocytes in the peripheral blood of T2DM mice db/db are
defective in type 1 and type 2 IFN signaling pathways, rendering them incapable of producing
interferon stimulus genes (ISGs) that are known to be immunomodulatory and anti-
inflammatory. Given the premise of the defective IFN responses in the db/db mice, we
hypothesize that they should show attenuated tolerance against cerebral ischemia following
TLR-mediated preconditioning compared to db/+ mice. To test hypothesis, we will compare the
effect of preconditioning with TLR agonists CpG or LPS in T2DM and control mice subjected to
MCAO by stroke outcome, blood flow imaging, coagulation. We will determine the effect of TLR-
mediated preconditioning on leukocyte trafficking to the meninges and brain parenchyma by
comparing phenotypes and transcriptome profile of leukocytes in each compartment. We will
also determine how the altered native immune responses in db/db mice predispose them to post
stroke immunosuppression and exacerbated vascular damage and BBB leakage compared to
control mice. The knowledge gained in this study will be insightful in identifying potential
therapeutic targets to circumvent age and metabolic disease-associated decline in ischemic
tolerance in multiple organs."
10606521,"Abstract
This proposal is to investigate a newly developed mucosal adjuvant for its effectiveness in bolstering
influenza (flu) vaccines in the elderly. Current flu vaccines are inefficacious in the elderly owing to the
aged immune system and their poor stimulation of cell-mediated immunity (CMI). A powerful adjuvant
capable of stimulating both humoral and cell immune responses in the elderly should greatly augment
existing flu vaccines, better safeguarding this aging and growing population. We recently engineered a
powerful mucosal adjuvant by encapsulating a natural STING agonist with pulmonary surfactant (PS)-
biomimetic liposomes, named PS-GAMP, based on recent findings that activation of STING, the
stimulator of IFN genes, can vigorously stimulate CMI and humoral immunity. PS-GAMP alongside
inactivated H1N1 vaccine induced a wide spectrum of cross-protection against distant H1N1 and
heterosubtypic H3N2, rgH5N1, and H7N9 viruses as early as 2 days after a single immunization. The
cross-protection lasted for at least 6 months, concurrent with durable lung tissue resident memory (TRM)
CD8+ T cells in young adult mice. We will extend the study to aged mice in this proposal and determine
whether strong CD8+ T-cells (and perhaps CD4+ T cells as well) can be quickly induced by PS-GAMP/flu
vaccine in aged mice. We will monitor a longevity of the heterosubtypic immunity, humoral immune
responses, and lung TRM CD8+ and CD4+ memory T cells as mice age. Because the vaccination does
not involve any replicating vaccine, pre-exiting immunity should have little effect on the efficacy of PS-
GAMP/flu vaccination, which will be investigated to demonstrate significant advantages of the vaccine
over live-attenuated intranasal flu vaccine that is ineffective in the elderly. Secondly, distinguished from
most prominent adjuvants primarily targeting antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or professional immune
cells, PS-GAMP activates both alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) and APCs. It would be interested to learn
whether PS-GAMP-mediated AEC activation can offset the defects of aged APCs, eliciting strong
heterosubtypic immunity in aged mice. The pivotal role for AEC will be also substantiated in ferret model.
Aim 3 will investigate whether PS-GAMP/flu vaccination can be further improved in aged mice by
suppressing inflammaging and/or removing senescence cells. Moreover, a novel, much more potent, and
pan-STING agonist will be explored to enhance PS-GAMP’s adjuvanticity and strengthen its clinical
potential. The study, if successful, would have significant impact on the overall health and quality of the
aged population not only for influenza but also for other respiratory viral infections like Covid-19."
10824379,"Summary:
Axon degeneration occurs during development of the nervous system as well as neuropathologies including
Alzheimer's, Luo Gehrig's, and Huntington's disease as well as stroke, and spinal cord injury. A common but
poorly defined feature of all forms of neural degeneration is the emergence of swellings or spheroids that appear
prior to irreversible breakdown of the axon. These degenerative spheroids were first observed in the early 1900's
by Cajal but their function has gone undescribed until our recent work. We found that in both developmental and
pathological contexts, diverse degenerative triggers converge on spheroid formation. In both contexts, spheroids
grow to the point of rupture and their contents hasten irreversible axon breakdown in an autocrine and paracrine
manner. This suggests that spheroids are not merely a morphological hallmark of degenerating axons but also
perform a critical function that may be universal to all forms of axon degeneration. We also suggest that spheroid
formation and rupture demarcates the transition from latent to catastrophic phases of axon degeneration. In Aim
1, we characterize the properties of spheroid formation (e.g. growth, movement, fusion, and rupture) as well as
the signaling pathways that control spheroid formation. In Aim2, we examine the pathways downstream of
spheroid rupture in regulating catastrophic axon degeneration. Finally, in Aim3, we determine whether mouse
lines with impaired Wallerian degeneration but intact (DR6-/- and Sarm1-/-) or deficient (Wlds) spheroid formation
influences recruitment of macrophages and regenerative capacity. Understanding how spheroids are formed
and how their contents induce catastrophic axon breakdown represents an important avenue toward developing
therapeutics for nervous system degeneration. Our expertise in mouse genetics, developmental neuroscience,
cytokine signaling, and biochemical analysis places us in a unique position to delineate mechanisms that have
eluded the field for decades."
10827927,"Project Summary
Transcription is the major control point of gene expression and RNA polymerase (RNAP), conserved
from bacteria to man, is the central enzyme of transcription. Our long term goal is to understand the
mechanism of transcription and its regulation. Determining three-dimensional structures of RNAP and
its complexes with DNA, RNA, and regulatory factors, is an essential step. We focus on highly
characterized prokaryotic RNAPs.
The basic elements of the transcription cycle, initiation, elongation, and termination, were elucidated
through study of prokaryotes. A detailed structural and functional understanding of the entire
transcription cycle is essential to explain the fundamental control of gene expression and to target
RNAP with small-molecule antibiotics. Moreover, a complete understanding of how a complex,
molecular machine uses binding and chemical energy to effect conformational changes that drive the
cycle, and how regulators modulate the cycle, is of fundamental interest.
The transcription cycle is marked by a series of stable complexes (core è holo è RPo è EC) that
interconvert through transient intermediates. The transitions between stable states are points of
heavy regulation that are poorly understood due to the lack of structural information. Major transitions
include:
Holoenzyme + promoter DNA è open promoter complex (initiation)
Open promoter complex è elongation complex (promoter escape, s dissociation)
Elongation complex è core RNAP + DNA + completed RNA transcript (termination)
Each of these transitions is characterized by unstable, transient intermediates that are extremely
challenging for structural biology. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful
method to visualize these transient states. We are combining cryo-EM with other approaches to
mechanistically and structurally characterize transient intermediates that govern transitions in the
bacterial transcription cycle, including promoter melting, the initiation to elongation transition, and
transcription termination. These findings will provide insight into the behavior of macromolecular
machines throughout biology."
10825547,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this proposal is to develop high-throughput mass spectrometry technologies applied to the
study of post-transcriptional RNA modifications (PTrMs) and associations with RNA binding proteins (RBPs).
Efficient RNA processing and protein translation requires interactions with numerous RNA binding proteins, and
can be regulated by chemical RNA modifications. PTrMs have been implicated in such diverse processes as
RNA splicing, nuclear export, stability, and translation. The mechanisms by which PTrMs control RNA fate has
opened up a new field dubbed “Epitranscriptomics”. Although there are antibody approaches to detect some
modifications, there is a need for orthogonal approaches for unbiased identification and analysis of PTrMs. Since
small DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus have both to employ cellular machinery to transcribe and translate
their gene products, and also develop ways to counteract host defenses, these viruses harness and manipulate
cellular RNA processing pathways. Virus infections thus provide elegant biological models to decipher how RNA
transcription and its chemical modifications can be regulated and exploited to direct the host cell machinery
towards production of viral progeny. Based on preliminary data generated by our collaborative team, our
objectives in this proposal are to employ Adenovirus as a model system to study PTrMs on non-coding and
messenger viral RNAs and how they are exploited to counter host defenses and promote efficient viral RNA
processing and progeny production. Adenoviruses are large non-eveloped viruses and include over 50 distinct
strains which elicit a wide range of effects in humans, from respiratory infections to life-threatening organ
problems in people with weakened immune systems. Adenoviruses hijack the host cell machinery to express
viral genes, and this is achieved by overtaking RNA-mediated processes. Our preliminary data show how
Adenovirus infection exploits the m6A modification on RNA to promote splicing and also alters RNA-protein
interactions. Here we will develop improved mass spectrometry (MS) technologies to quantitatively and
comprehensively detect RNA modifications and RNA-protein interactions over a detailed time-course of infection.
Our MS technology will be paired with cellular and genetic assays to determine how the modifications are utilized
by Adenovirus to promote growth and counter host defenses in ways that culminate in human disease. These
high-throughput unbiased MS-based technologies and approaches will be broadly applicable to enable new
biology in virus-host interactions and epitranscriptomics."
10854737,"ABSTRACT
The field of sight restoration has made dramatic progress over the last decade. Two types of
retinal implants have been commercially approved, and several other designs are in development
worldwide. In addition, two groups are actively implanting and developing cortical electronic
implants. The first optogenetic clinical trial has begun, with many others likely in the next two
years. Within a decade, many blind individuals are likely to be offered a wide range of options
for sight restoration that depend on widely different technologies.
Interactions between implant electronics and the underlying neurophysiology of the retina or
cortex mean that the vision provided by most of these technologies will differ substantially from
normal sight. The question of this proposal is – What role can cortical plasticity play in helping
patients make use of this artificial visual input?
Over the past 15 years our research group has been generating computational models, developed
using a combination of physiological and psychophysical data, which can predict the percepts
that patients might experience for a variety of sight recovery technologies. We propose to use
these models to simulate, within visually normal participants, four critical neurophysiological
distortions inherent in sight restoration technologies:
Aim 1. Abnormal neuronal population responses during retinal stimulation: Simultaneous stimulation of
on and off cells.
Aim 2. Spatial distortions: Stimulation of retinal ganglion cell axons.
Aim 3. Abnormal cortical neuronal population responses: Distortions induced by the V1 neural
architecture.
Aim 4. Temporal blurring due to slow optogenetic kinetics.
Our goal is to use normally sighted participants, viewing distorted visual input, as ‘virtual
patients’ to learn which spatiotemporal distortions can be compensated for by plasticity, and
which must be compensated for in device design. This will provide device manufacturers with a
more nuanced understanding of the abilities and limits of visual perceptual adaptability.
Finally, this work will provide novel insights regarding the fundamental mechanisms of cortical
plasticity by asking whether, in adulthood, it is possible to reconfigure the fundamental building blocks
of visual perception?"
10857135,"Hemangiogenesis, the formation of functional blood and endothelial cells (EC), is requisite for successful
embryogenesis. We have so far demonstrated that blood and ECs develop from the PDGFRa-FLK1+
hemangiogenic mesoderm, which originates from the PDGFRa+ nascent mesoderm through a
PDGFRa+FLK-1+ intermediary (i.e., PDGFRa+ ® PDGFRa+FLK1+ ® PDGFRa-FLK1+). We recently
performed single-cell RNA sequencing and mapped a developmental pathway of the hemangiogenesis. In
this process, we discovered that hemangiogenic lineage shares a close molecular ontogeny with the
smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineage. Moreover, in vivo, yolk sac SMCs still retained the Flk1+ mesoderm
transcriptome signature. Therefore, we proposed that the SMC lineage is the default pathway of the FLK1+
mesoderm. In further delineating mechanisms involved in the hemangiogenesis, we have shown that the
transition from PDGFRa+FLK1+ to the PDGFRa-FLK1+ stage is dependent on the ETS transcription factor
ETV2, a critical factor for the formation of hematopoietic and endothelial cell lineages. At the molecular
level, ETV2 positively activates genes essential for hematopoietic and endothelial cell lineage specification.
Two critical events occur in the transition from PDGFRa+FLK1+ to the PDGFRa-FLK1+ stage. First, Etv2
expression becomes higher, suggesting an Etv2 threshold mechanism in hemangiogenesis critical for this
transition. Second, ETV2 target gene loci become accessible, suggesting epigenetic and chromatin
changes occurring during this transition. We identified BAF155, a subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF
chromatin-remodeling BAF (BRG1/BRM associated factor) complex, as a cofactor of ETV2. This finding
suggests that ETV2 utilizes BAF in reconfiguring chromatin accessibility of its target gene loci. A deeper
understanding of the lineage relationship among FLK1+ populations and molecular processes occurring
during the transition from PDGFRa+FLK1+ to PDGFRa-FLK1+ will be critical for further understanding how
the hematopoietic and vascular systems are established in embryogenesis. This proposal's overarching
goal is to gain deeper molecular insights into the regulation of Flk1+ lineage allocation concerning Etv2 and
Baf155 expression and function. To this end, we will determine if hemangiogenic vs. SMC lineage fate of
the FLK1+ mesoderm is controlled by the Etv2 dosage (aim 1), determine if PDGFRa+FLK1+ to the
PDGFRa-FLK1+ transition requires ETV2 mediated Flk1 enhancer switching mechanisms (aim 2), and
determine the chromatin remodeling requirements in the ETV2 regulation of hemangiogenesis (aim 3). The
successful completion of the proposed studies will advance our understanding of how hematopoietic and
EC development is regulated. Ultimately, this knowledge will be instrumental for generating hematopoietic
and ECs from pluripotent stem cells or somatic cell reprogramming and the function of such cells in a wide
range of regenerative medicine applications."
10833501,"SUMMARY
Worldwide, over 3 billion people are at risk of infection and disease caused by dengue virus 1-4 (DENV1-4) and
Zika virus (ZIKV), both potentially severe flaviviral diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. The devastating
effects of endemic dengue across the tropics and subtropics are well documented. The recent Zika pandemic
galvanized research as Zika swept across Latin America. Three years after the peak of the Zika pandemic, major
dengue epidemics have started to re-occur; however, the future of flaviviral disease across areas with
widespread ZIKV immunity is unknown. In this R01, we propose to develop new tools and address key
knowledge gaps in flaviviral transmission and immunological interactions between DENV and ZIKV to
understand how widespread ZIKV immunity impacts subsequent dengue disease and to inform
evaluation of dengue and Zika clinical vaccine trials and post-licensure studies. Based on our serological,
epidemiological, and clinical data to date, our overall hypothesis is that DENV1-4 and ZIKV are antigenically
closely related and that immune interactions mutually affect transmission and disease severity. We will address
this hypothesis with the ongoing Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study (PDCS, 2004-present), a community-based
prospective cohort study in Managua, Nicaragua, following ~4,000 children, now in its 17th year. Samples from
the PDCS, as well as companion studies in Managua, provide documented infection and disease data, as well
as banked serum samples for over a decade before the arrival of ZIKV. The proposed study extends the cohort,
ensuring that we are able to fully document the interactions of these viruses from the pre- to post-Zika eras. In
Aim 1, we will develop innovative serologic tools based on glycan-fusion-loop-masked envelope proteins and
new algorithms to distinguish DENV and ZIKV infection histories, critical for vaccination and epidemiological
studies of dengue and Zika. We will then test our hypothesis that pre-existing ZIKV immunity can enhance
disease severity caused by DENV3 but protect against DENV1. In Aim 2, we will measure changes in anti-DENV
and anti-ZIKV antibody-mediated immunity over time, estimate annual changes in protective and enhancing
population immunity to each virus, collect entomological data, and use modeling approaches to evaluate popula-
tion susceptibility to DENV and ZIKV infection and the potential for future epidemics by incorporating immunolo-
gical and entomological data. In Aim 3, we will identify determinants of protective and disease-enhancing anti-
body-mediated immunity of prior DENV infection on Zika and prior ZIKV infection on dengue disease and
severity. With support of expert collaborators, we will use state-of-the-art tools (e.g., new monoclonal antibodies,
innovative flavivirus antigens, and antibody Fc profiling) to analyze specific infection histories and uncover
potential immune correlates. Overall, this program will define new vaccine companion diagnostic assays, the
dynamics of the antibody response to DENV and ZIKV, and correlates of protection and pathogenesis for
dengue and Zika, which should be useful for the development and evaluation of dengue and Zika vaccines."

Research: Although both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA methylation play important roles
in regulating gene expression, the associations between SNPs/DNA methylation and expression of disease
genes in childhood asthma are mostly unknown. Due to the multiple-testing problem, most studies focus on
identifying the regulation of gene expression by cis- (nearby) DNA features, rather than a combination of cis-
and trans (far from genes) regulation. To overcome the major multiple-testing problem, we will develop a novel
statistical machine learning method that can handle a large number of variables of omics data without multiple-
testing correction issues. In Aim 1, I will identify cis and trans genetic (SNPs) and epigenetic
(methylation) factors that regulate gene expression in the nasal epithelium of asthmatic and healthy
subjects. Through this analysis, I will uncover novel SNPs and methylation CpGs that may have not been
found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). In Aim 2,
I will estimate the genetic and epigenetic contributions to the expressions of genes that are associated
with atopic asthma. This study also will classify genes that are affected the most by genetic factors and
genes that are affected mostly by epigenetic factors, which include environmental factors. In Aim 3, I will
develop statistical methods to identify SNPs that indirectly regulate gene expression through
methylation in nasal epithelium of asthmatic and healthy subjects. The outcome of this work will be a
better understanding of the abnormal molecular and cellular mechanisms through which asthma develops, and
the application of this knowledge to help to produce new therapies for asthma."
10831964,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic metabolic disorder that is characterized by immune-mediated β cell
destruction, resulting in the lifelong need for exogenous insulin therapy. Historically, T1D has been considered a disease of β cell homicide. However, recent evidence suggests that the β cell actively contributes to its own demise in T1D through engagement of cell intrinsic stress pathways that both hasten cell death and exacerbate autoimmunity. microRNAs (miRNAs, 18-25 nt) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that post transcriptionally modulate gene expression by binding the 3’untranslated region of a target mRNA to either inhibit mRNA translation or cause mRNA degradation. In addition to these regulatory roles within their cells of origin, miRNAs can be packaged and released within extracellular vesicles (EVs), which can be transferred to recipient cells to both facilitate intercellular communication and promote disease pathogenesis. While miRNAs have been shown to regulate several key processes within the β cell and have been implicated as potential mediators of a dialogue
between the immune system and the β cell in diabetes, a full understanding of the role of miRNAs in T1D pathophysiology remains elusive. To this end, we profiled changes in miRNA expression patterns in human islets and islet-derived extracellular vesicles (EV’s) in response to IL-1β and IFN-γ, two cytokines selected to model the inflammatory intra-islet milieu observed in T1D. Our initial small RNA sequencing and additional preliminary data has shown that islet miRNA expression patterns are responsive to inflammatory extrinsic cues and that miRNAs appear to be selectively packaged into islet-derived EV’s in response to cytokine treatment. Moreover, islet and islet-derived EV miRNAs exhibited striking sexually dimorphic expression patterns under basal conditions and following cytokine treatment. Interestingly, miR-155-5p and miR-146-5p were the only two miRNAs that were coordinately upregulated in cytokine-treated islets and islet-derived EVs from both male and
female donors, and upregulation of these miRNAs was associated with detrimental changes in β cell function and survival. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that β cell miR-155-5p and miR-146-5p function as key molecular hubs during the evolution of T1D, playing a role in disease pathogenesis, while also having potential utility as diabetes biomarkers. To test this hypothesis, we aim to: 1) define how miRNA signatures change in human β cells during T1D progression using state-of-the art smFISH imaging approaches, focused on miR-155 and 146 and a panel of additional miRNAs predicted to have either common or distinct expression patterns in males and females; 2) elucidate the  mechanisms underlying miR-155-5p and miR-146-5p upregulation under inflammatory conditions; 3) define how miR-146 and miR-155 regulate β cell function and survival, leveraging both ex vivo human islet models and novel mouse models of β cell specific deletion of miR-155; and 4) test the utility of EV miRNA signatures informed from islet RNA sequencing as clinical biomarkers using plasma EVs and
β cell enriched plasma EVs collected from pediatric subjects with recent onset T1D or autoantibody positivity."
10829833,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chemical modifications on mammalian messenger RNA (mRNA) have recently been shown to play critical and
diverse regulatory roles in mRNA metabolism and translation. For example, the most abundant mRNA
modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is crucial for mammalian stem cell differentiation and tissue
development in almost all systems tested so far. Dedicated proteins, many of which are essential in mammals,
have evolved to install, recognize, and remove m6A marks (writers, readers, and erasers, respectively).
Dysregulation of m6A methylation has been connected to a variety of human diseases and disorders. Functional
roles have also been proposed for other internal modifications present in mammalian mRNA, including, but not
limited to: pseudouridine (Ψ), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), 2’-O-methylation (Nm), N1-methyladenosine (m1A), N7-
methylguanosine (m7G), and N3-methylcytosine (m3C). Our most recent research has uncovered modifications
on chromosome-associated regulatory RNAs (carRNAs), such as promoter-associated RNA (paRNA), enhancer
RNA (eRNA), and repeat RNAs, as well as frequent modifications in introns of pre-mRNA. The carRNA
modifications have been shown to regulate chromatin state and transcription, and intron modifications may affect
pre-mRNA processing. Despite rapid advances in the discovery and functional characterization of various RNA
modifications and their effector proteins, a significant bottleneck limits the entire field of epitranscriptomics
research: a dearth of quantitative sequencing methods that can comprehensively map most RNA modifications
at base resolution with exact modification fraction information. The availability of such methods is critical for
assessing the importance of these modifications in different regions of mRNA, examining the effects of dynamic
changes in modification fraction, assigning modifications to different writers and analyzing their functional
relevance, identifying target transcripts and sites of demethylation and analyzing their functional relevance,
discovering new effectors for RNA modifications by overlapping with known RBP-binding sites or genomics
features, and evaluating the physiological consequences of RNA modifications in biological processes. We have
established both nucleic acid chemistry and directed protein evolution platforms to invent new technologies that
transform RNA modifications to be read out as mutations or deletions that are universally compatible with extant
sequencing platforms. Computational pipelines and RNA modification databases will be built to support the new
method development and epitranscriptome research in the broad community. These new technologies will be
optimized to work on low-input samples, particularly neuronal and clinical samples. We will focus on integrating
new methods into robust protocols to map multiple RNA modifications in single experiments. Our proposed
research will deliver high-throughput, high-resolution, and high-sensitivity methods that simultaneously map
multiple RNA modifications in all biological areas."

This project will contribute novel pre-trained DNA Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers,
called DNABERT, and associated deep-learning tools to decipher the language of non-coding DNA and facilitate
integration of gene regulatory information from rapidly accumulating sequence data with NLM’s genetic
databases (for example, dbSNP, dbGaP and ClinVar), which serve both scientists and the public health by
helping identify the genetic components of disease. While the genetic code explaining how DNA is translated
into proteins is universal, the regulatory code that determines when and how the genes are expressed varies
across different cell-types and organisms. Non-coding DNA is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy
and distant semantic relationship, from a language modeling perspective. Recently, deep learning methods have
been used in unraveling the gene regulatory code, but failed to globally and robustly model such language
features in the genome, especially in data-scarce scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose DNABERT
to model DNA as a language, by adapting the idea of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
(BERT). Based on recent observations in natural language processing research, we hypothesize that pre-trained
transformer-based neural network model offer a promising, and yet not fully explored, deep learning approach
for a variety of sequence prediction tasks in the analysis of non-coding DNA. Our preliminary results showed
that DNABERT on the human genome achieved state-of-the-art performance on promoter and splice-site
prediction tasks, after easy fine-tuning on small task-specific data (Ji, Y. et al. 2020). The goal of our proposed
research is to develop DNABERT for a variety of sequence prediction tasks, and benchmark with existing state-
of-the-art deep-learning based methods. Specific aims are (1) develop novel deep-learning methods by adapting
BERT; (2) apply the proposed deep-learning methods to specifically target non-coding DNA sequence analyses
and predictions; and (3) predict and validate functional non-coding genetic variants by applying DNABERT
prediction models. A major contribution of the proposed research is development of pre-trained DNABERT model
and prediction algorithms, which present new powerful methods for analyses and predictions of DNA sequences.
Since the pre-training of DNABERT is resource-intensive, we will provide the source code and pre-trained model
at Github for future academic research. We will also develop an integrated web server to (1) deploy DNABERT
model, (2) database to store the identified sequence features and predictions, and (3) tutorials to help users to
apply DNABERT to their specific research problems. We anticipate that DNABERT can bring new advancements
and insights to the bioinformatics community by bringing advanced language modeling perspective to gene
regulation analyses."

 Regulation of ion transport across the epithelium is vital to the health and function of the airways. Active
and passive ion and water movement is responsible for maintaining a periciliary fluid layer through which cilia
can move mucus and protect the airways against particles, irritants, and pathogens. While there is clear
evidence of disease caused by specific ion channel mutations (CFTR) as well acquired ion channel dysfunction
during/contributing to disease severity (COPD, asthma), the contribution of individual cell types of the
pulmonary epithelium to ion transport maintenance is poorly understood. Our experimental evidence
demonstrates that alterations in the frequencies of pulmonary ionocytes and neuroendocrine cells in airway
epithelial cultures result in dramatic differences in ion transport properties. Altogether, these cell types, along
with tuft-like cells, comprise about 0.8% of the total cell numbers in the human tracheal epithelium. Pulmonary
ionocytes are a newly identified cell type in the airways with extremely high expression of many ion channels
with vital functions in the respiratory tract. The dramatic impact of ionocytes and pulmonary neuroendocrine
cells on the ion transport properties of human airway cultures despite their rare frequencies led to our
hypothesis that these cell types are highly involved in the regulation and maintenance of ion transport balance
across the entire epithelium and are able to impact ion transport functions in other cell types through
intercellular communication. By utilizing novel murine models and applying innovative techniques to primary
murine and human airway epithelial cells, the research outlined in this proposal will define the contribution of
these rare cell types to the overall ion transport functions of the airway epithelium and will also define the role
of CFTR in these cells. We will thereby fully characterize the significance of pulmonary ionocytes and
neuroendocrine cells to ion transport-mediated airway surface liquid regulation and identify potential cell and
ion channel targets for therapeutic treatment of common airway diseases."

Danielson, a clinical psychologist and scientist, demonstrated she is the ideal candidate for this mechanism. The
impact of her protected time for expanded research and mentorship are evident through numerous achievements
from over this funding period, including productive mentorship of 23 mentees (>50% from underrepresented
backgrounds), awards in recognition of this mentorship, a new line of research in mHealth HIV and addiction
prevention intervention, and continuous federal-funding of her innovative patient oriented research (POR) in
which she has involved her mentees. Her mentees, who have included early-career faculty, post-doctoral fellows,
and predoctoral psychology interns, are making significant contributions to the HIV prevention, substance abuse,
and traumatic stress fields through high-impact publications and new lines of NIH-funded research. The
proposed K24 award renewal will be essential for providing the time and resources necessary for the candidate
to expand her research skills in virtual reality technologies for young people at high risk for HIV acquisition and
addiction, sustain her mentoring program and capacity, and further stimulate the research program of her
mentees (e.g., through a trainee pilot award program that was successful during the prior funding period).
Innovative research proposed by Dr. Danielson under the K24 renewal involves refinement and evaluation of a
virtual reality clinical tool to improve trauma-informed assessment and prevention of substance use and sexual
risk behavior with at-risk young people. This will be accomplished through input and training from leading experts
in the virtual reality-high risk behavior research field; an internationally known technology firm in virtual reality
tool development (Virtually Better, Inc.); qualitative research; an Advisory Board of consumers and experts; and
evaluation of the validity, acceptability, and feasibility of the refined virtual reality tool with high risk populations
(e.g., adolescents in treatment for substance use problems and traumatic stress; young adults presenting to a
high-risk HIV clinic) and health care providers. Dr. Danielson's proposed mentorship activities, current federally-
funded research projects, and aims to pursue innovative, virtual reality research in the areas of HIV prevention,
substance use risk reduction, and trauma among adolescents harmonize well with NIDA priorities that call for
research designed to evaluate the application of new technologies for delivering adapted prevention
interventions targeting substance use and prevention of HIV acquisition. The proposed research affords rich
training opportunities for her mentees (with an emphasis on trainees from groups under-represented in clinical
science) and will invigorate new directions in POR with young people at risk for HIV acquisition and addiction."
10845373,"Project Summary/Abstract
Movement is the primary way in which animals interact with the world. To produce the incredibly adaptable behavior of
mammals the brain must continually choose actions, then flexibly generate control signals for the body. The main
objective of this project is to understand how ensembles of neurons and brain areas work together to control movement
and make simple decisions. To understand how behavior is generated, we must know: How is a high-level decision (e.g.,
reach left vs. right) transformed into a time-varying command signal? And, how does this transformation and the
generation of complex outputs exploit the precise biology of neural tissue to function reliably, despite the inherent
noisiness of neurons? This goal is critical not only to better understand how neural tissue implements challenging
computations, but also because deeper knowledge of these processes is likely to improve treatments for motor disorders
such as Parkinson’s and disorders heavily affecting neural connections such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. To
achieve this aim, we pair the power of experimental tools in mice together with dynamical systems analysis, which
provides mathematical tools for investigating the function of neural ensembles. In the monkey, the dynamical systems
approach has led to many insights. For example, we have learned that activity in motor cortex unfolds over time according
to oscillatory dynamical “rules”; that much of motor cortical activity exists to support these dynamical rules and does not
influence movement directly; and that there is a separation between signals for what movement will be made and when it
will be initiated. In the mouse, we propose taking this approach several steps further by mapping the dynamical rules to
specific biological features, such as cortical layers and projection pathways. In Aim 1, we will use two-photon calcium
imaging to record neural activity during a simple reaching task that elicits variable movements from the mouse. We will
then exploit this variability with our dynamical systems tools to identify the rules that govern the M1 pattern generator,
and uncover how these rules map to cortical layers. In Aim 2, we will determine how information processing is divided
into stages as signals are passed from visual decision areas to motor areas. This second Aim will employ a more complex
visually-guided joystick task, together with optogenetic inhibition of specific pathways, calcium imaging, and retrograde
tracing. This will allow us to compare activity in the neurons that connect areas with those that are engaged only in local
processing. Finally, in Aim 3, we will record from identified projection neurons and apply powerful new machine learning
techniques to test two competing theories of how the brain produces consistent outputs: whether the brain suppresses
neural “noise” in the output neurons themselves, or suppresses only task-relevant noise according to a more population-
oriented approach. These findings will advance our understanding of sophisticated cortical processes including decision
making and motor control by grounding theoretical ideas about neural computation in our biological understanding of the
tissue that implements it."
10869924,"SUMMARY
The mission of the NBETP is to train early-mid stage graduate students to become future leaders
at the interface between neurobiology and engineering. This is accomplished via a blend of
course requirements in neuroscience and engineering, including several dedicated neurotech-
nology classes, as well as through mentorship and community-associated events that encourage
student leadership and career development. Students admitted into the program are selected
based on intellectual caliber, leadership potential, commitment to neurobiological engineering
research, willingness to take on risky and potentially game-changing projects, and diversity. Stu-
dents are engaged in innovation of emerging bioengineered technologies that enable fundamen-
tal biological discoveries with translational potential related to a broad spectrum of neurobiolog-
ical diseases including neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, as well as addiction. Goals
of the program are thus very well aligned to the objectives of NIBIB-funded T32 grants and to
the mission of NIBIB overall, and they also synergize with interests of ICs such as NIMH, NINDS,
and NIDA. An administrative structure oversees the training program’s direction, student admis-
sion, and assessments. Preceptors associated with the NBETP include a set of faculty with di-
verse, multidisciplinary expertise encompassing multiple departments and intersection of multi-
ple traditional disciplines such as bioengineering, electrical engineering, chemistry, and neuro-
biology. The program thus closely fits the profile of a “broad-based NRSA training program,” as
described in NOT-EB-07-005. Funding currently provides for four predoctoral students to partic-
ipate in the program for two years each. In its first five years, the program has attracted a diverse
set of trainees and offered them important and enriching experiences during and after their
funded periods. The program has also contributed to substantial research and leadership ac-
complishments by individual trainees, as well as to significant expansion of the footprint and
visibility of neuroengineering research and education at MIT and beyond. In the next five years,
if our renewal application is supported, we will have exciting opportunities to enhance the pro-
gram, develop further experiences for our trainees, and begin to observe outcomes following
graduation of our first cohorts of trainees. We hope that the program can be renewed with further
funding from the NIH, and we are confident that the program can continue to offer outstanding
benefits to our trainees and to the broader community."
10818409,"Project Summary
Over 25 million people per year are treated emergently for injuries and more than 5 million people are admitted
annually for critical illness. This Interdisciplinary Training in Injury and Critical Illness will help contribute to the
next generation of trauma surgeon-scientists who can tackle the basic, translational, and clinical aspects of
research spanning the bench to bedside. This research will center on the broad-expertise of our 16 Scientific
Mentors covering the domains 1) Injury and 2) Critical Illness. Interdisciplinary participating faculty have
extensive collaborations with each other and hail from the 6 Departments (Surgery, Orthopedics, Plastics,
Medicine, Anesthesiology, and Engineering). Vanderbilt is at the nexus of 70,000 miles of injured and critically
ill patients with annual trauma evaluations exceeding 6,000/year, offering robust opportunities for primary and
secondary analysis of prospective clinical cohort and multicenter clinical trial data, as well as translational
approaches to important aspects of injury and critical illness (e.g., lung injury, peripheral nerve injury,
orthopedic trauma, sepsis, burns, cognitive impairment). Dr. Mayur B. Patel, a previous post-doctoral T32
trainee, now established academic trauma surgeon-scientist, will lead this T32 program as Program Director to
develop the next generation of future surgeon-scientists. Scientific Mentors who serve as primary mentors for
T32-funded trainees hold secondary appointments in multiple basic science and clinical departments and
associated research centers. The proposed T32 training program will commence after a national search for
high-performing candidates, who have completed a minimal of two years of surgical training (or equivalent
clinical or post-doctoral experience), and ultimately support up to one new post-doctoral trainees per year. Two
years of dedicated research training will be required for all trainees. To maximize scientific career development
potential, our training program offers the rigorous opportunity to earn additional graduate training (e.g., Master
of Public Health, Master of Clinical Investigation)."
10833629,"Project Summary
This project investigates the use of repetitive visual stimulation as a tool to improve visual cognition. Surprisingly,
the repeated presentation of simple visual patterns can result in long-term plasticity, reflected in increased neural
responses, but also in behavioral improvements that last for hours, even days. In current approaches using RVS,
however, these improvements are limited to the specific, repeated patterns; this limits the practical usefulness
of RVS. The proposed project builds on recent findings in the nonhuman primate demonstrating widespread and
general increases in neural responses after the repeated presentation of a uniform grey screen with sinusoidally
modulated luminance. The first aim is to show, using EEG, that such long-lasting increases in neural responses
also occur in the human brain. The second aim is to determine which aspects of visual cognition are improved
by this boost in neural responses. The project will assess improvements in low-level vision such as detection
and visual acuity, but also higher-level visual processes such as visuospatial attention, and visual working
memory. The pilot data already show widespread neural changes in the human brain and substantial behavioral
improvements in, for instance, visual acuity. A successful tool to improve visual cognition would have a significant
impact, as it could be used therapeutically in low vision conditions (e.g., amblyopia), but also in the elderly or
healthy human subjects, to deliver a boost in performance."

10825585,"The University of Cincinnati Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training (CCTST) has an
excellent record of accomplishment in training KL2 Scholars. The KL2 program has appointed 24 Scholars
(50% women, 12.5% underrepresented) from diverse disciplines since 2009 (2 per year, for 2- to 3-year
appointments). Scholars have published a total of 674 manuscripts and presented 792 abstracts and
workshops at national and international scientific meetings. Of the 20 graduates, 95% are still conducting
Clinical and Translational Research (CTR) and 100% have served as Principal Investigator (PI) or Co-
Investigator (Co-I) of an externally-funded CTR grant: 20% have transitioned to PI of a career
development award (CDA), 65% to PI of a federal independent grant, 75% to PI of a CDA or federal
independent grant, and 95% to PI or Co-I of a federal independent grant. Graduates have served as PI of
7 R01s, 3 independent Department of Defense grants, 4 R21s, 1 R03, 2 R40s, 1 R25, 1 R15, 1 U19, 2 K23s, 1
K25, and 1 American Heart Association CDA. They have served as site PI of 3 U01s. The sum of direct costs
generated by Scholars’ grants is $109,286,934. Our team has increasingly appreciated the need to address
the challenges to developing junior researchers, including: 1) recruiting and developing diverse investigators;
2) training them to be competent in a broad spectrum of core CTR skills; 3) preparing them to successfully
conduct team science; 4) ensuring that they achieve sustainable and independent careers; 5) fostering vitality
(professionally engaged, committed, and fulfilled) despite increasing levels of burnout among academic faculty;
and 6) encouraging them to integrate stakeholder priorities in research and disseminate research to improve
health outcomes. As a result, we have designed our KL2 Scholars program to address these challenges using
evidence-based strategies, to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1) Train the next generation of clinical and
translational investigators through mentored research experiences, core methods and skills development, and
tailored experiential learning opportunities; 2) Develop engaged, diverse junior investigators who have
sustainable translational research careers; and 3) Promote the translation of Scholar research into improved
health outcomes across the lifespan. We have planned several new collaborations across CTSA hubs and a
number of innovations that can be scaled up to include other hubs, using the 3D (develop, demonstrate and
disseminate) approach. We have designed a rigorous program evaluation plan including NCATS common
metrics, have incorporated broad training in research ethics, and have developed a comprehensive plan to
increase the recruitment and retention of investigators who are underrepresented in biomedical research.
Success will be measured by the following outcomes: 1) we recruit diverse, vibrant Scholars, 2) Scholars
secure grants and publish work in high-impact journals; 3) Scholars develop sustained, independent research
careers; and 4) Scholars’ research results in improved health outcomes."
10835888,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Institute of Medicine recommends that each cancer patient receive a survivorship care plan that
summarizes information important to the individual’s long-term care, including the following: (1) cancer type
and treatments, (2) their potential consequences, (3) recommendations regarding preventive practices, and (4)
specific information about recommended follow-up. Despite their clinical importance, gaps in CRC surveillance
care and preventive care exist among CRC survivors. Unmet symptom needs are also prevalent and
undertreated.
We propose to evaluate the capacity of an interactive survivorship care plan (SCP) delivered through an
Internet-based personal health record (PHR) to meet the needs of CRC survivors. PHRs combine health
information and medical data with knowledge management and software tools to potentially enable patients to
become active participants in their own care. A SCP delivered via an appropriately designed PHR may
promote increased concordance with CRC surveillance and preventive care guidelines through the exchange
of health information between CRC survivors and health care providers. A survivorship care plan-personal
health record (SCP-PHR) may also improve care for symptoms through the combination of longitudinal PHR-
based symptom measurement and tailored self-management tools. To understand the effectiveness of the
SCP-PHR, we will conduct a randomized clinical effectiveness trial at the patient level. We will assess impact
of the SCP-PHR across a variety of measures and outcomes, including CRC surveillance, preventive care
receipt, patient symptoms, and patient-centered quality.
To simultaneously understand the effectiveness and implementation of the SCP-PHR, we will conduct a hybrid
type I effectiveness-implementation trial consisting of the following components: (A) a randomized clinical
effectiveness trial at the patient level, and (B) a mixed methods implementation study. The mixed methods
portion of the study will consist of a quantitative evaluation of patient attitudes toward technology associated
with the frequency and patterns of SCP-PHR use, as well as a qualitative process evaluation using semi-
structured interviews to assess facilitators and barriers to implementation of the SCP-PHR among key
stakeholders: patients, health care providers, and organizational leaders. This study design will enable us to
meet the simultaneous needs of understanding the effectiveness and the health care context of SCP
implementation."
10848289,"Abstract. The Legionella genus has more than 60 species from which 20 are associated with Legionnaires’
disease, a form of atypical pneumonia. More than 90% of Legionnaires’ disease cases are caused by L.
pneumophila serogroup 1. Legionella tends to colonize plumbing system biofilms and amoebae cysts which are
resistant to water purification treatment. The ability of Legionella spp. to persist and multiply in amoeba and
humans and cause clinical disease depends on a set of virulence genes and on the coordinate regulation of gene
functions that combat the effects of innate and acquired host defenses. Therefore, the main objective of this
proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that Legionella pneumophila has evolved to overcome host
innate immune responses and allow it to establish an infection.
The L. pneumophila genome contains clusters of genes that encode two types of type IV (TIVSS) secretion
systems; lvh and dot/icm. While the genetic organization of dot/icm, and its role in virulence is well established,
there is limited information about the role of Lvh TIVSS. The Legionella strains that lack Lvh TIVSS have
markedly reduced cytotoxicity. Additionally, Lvh TIVSS plays an important role in host-cell infection by L.
pneumophila grown at 30°C, and in the effective delay of phagosome acidification. The L. pneumophila lvh locus
is required for the restoration of entry and intracellular multiplication in dot/icm mutants following incubation
in water and amoeba encystment. We have demonstrated that Legionella pneumophila’s Lvh TIVSS machinery
localize at cell poles, and such localization has been reported to be important for virulence in other pathogens.
We also demonstrated that Lvh TIVSS is important for host-cell caspase-3/7 activation when Legionella strains
are grown under 30°C. Based on our preliminary data and data from the literature, our central hypothesis is that
Lvh contributes to Legionella virulence under infection from the environment and regulates late stages of cellular
infection and further dissemination of bacteria. We will test our central hypothesis and attain our objective by
evaluating the role of Lvh TIVSS in the modulation of host cell immunity, gene expression, and
programmed cell death.
Revealing Lvh functions will uncover sites of potential weakness in bacterial pathogens that may be exploited
for therapeutic intervention, development of rational, optimally efficacious vaccines, and disease control. Thus,
the main goal of this project is to understand how the host-cell immune system recognizes microbial virulence
factors during infection, produces a protective response, and the mechanism by which Legionella Lvh can inhibit
this protective response. The results from this work will have an important positive impact on human health
because they will provide important information about pathways or networks altered by L. pneumophila Lvh
TIVSS in the host, which may lay the groundwork for the development of a new class of targeted treatments."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of the Cardiorenal and Metabolic Disease Research Center (CMDRC) COBRE is to bring together
a multidisciplinary group of basic, clinical, and population scientists to work synergistically on the theme of
cardiorenal and metabolic diseases. During Phases 1 and 2, the CMDRC - Core C provided COBRE
investigators and external researchers access to technical expertise and equipment to perform a wide variety
of molecular, genetic, and next generation sequencing studies. During Phases 1 and 2, Core C also made
major advances toward ensuring sustainability of its services. During Phase 3, the newly named Core C -
Omics, Bioinformatics and Flow Cytometry will extend its services and offer cutting-edge cellular and
molecular analysis through building on existing infrastructure supported in Phases 1 and 2 (Genomics and
Mass Spectrometry) to offer new cutting-edge omics methodologies as well as offer new capabilities through
recently acquired state-of-the-art cell sorting and flow cytometry equipment. The Omics and Bioinformatics
Sub-Core and Cell Sorting/Flow Cytometry Sub-Core will allow CMDRC investigators comprehensive
molecular or systems biology approaches to their research questions through detailed insight into cell-type
specific function, generation of “omics” datasets, and ultimately integration with detailed phenotype
information to provide greater depth and insight into biological processes associated with obesity, cardiorenal,
and metabolic diseases. Core C has four aims: (1) to provide CMDRC investigators access to technical
expertise and cutting-edge omics services, including next generation sequencing technologies (single cell
RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics) and facilitate proteomic technologies by leveraging existing IDeA
funded infrastructure (offer and coordinate proteomics services and through IDeA National Resource for
Quantitative Proteomics program); (2) to provide CMDRC investigators access to cutting-edge cell sorting
and flow cytometry expertise and services; (3) to provide education and training opportunities for students,
trainees, and faculty in omics technologies and flow cytometry; and (4) to provide continuous improvement in
existing assays and services and to enhance technological capabilities through acquisition of new cutting-
edge instrumentation that will assist in sustainability of the Core. Therefore, it is the objective of the CMDRC
- Core C to aid investigators in advancing scientific discovery in obesity, cardiorenal, and metabolic diseases
through application of state-of-the-art cell sorting, flow cytometry, and omics technologies to generate greater
insights into these diseases. Aside from CMDRC investigators, continued funding of the COBRE during Phase
3 will have a significant impact on providing external researchers (at other Mississippi undergraduate
institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)) access to equipment and expertise that
would otherwise not be available in our region of the country."

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Cardiorenal and Metabolic Diseases Research Center (CMDRC) at the University of Mississippi Medical
Center (UMMC) developed a highly successful Pilot Projects Program (PPP) during Phases 1 and 2 of COBRE
support. Over the past 9 years, the CMDRC PPP has provided funding, mentoring, core services, and
enhanced research infrastructure for 24 pilot grant investigators. The success of this program is highlighted by
~$26.92 million dollars in extramural funding obtained by previous PPP awardees as well as 459 papers
published in leading journals in the field, 15 book chapters and 286 presentations at international and national
meetings. To amplify the research base developed in Phases 1 and 2, the Phase 3 PPP will continue to
support innovative research in the areas of cardiorenal and metabolic diseases. The PPP has four specific
aims to achieve these goals: 1) To enhance the PPP developed during Phases 1 and 2, with continued
emphasis on soliciting and identifying a diverse group of promising investigators whose research focuses on
cardiorenal and metabolic diseases for mentoring and funding to expand the critical mass of extramurally
funded CMDRC investigators; 2) To provide rigorous ongoing evaluation of the progress of individual PPP
awardees and the overall PPP to maximize the impact on the investigators mentored and funded through this
program; 3) To facilitate formation of new collaborative, multidisciplinary teams of investigators whose
complementary expertise catalyzes the development of translational projects that result in competitive, cutting-
edge multi-PI proposals for extramural funding; 4) To increase the critical mass of investigators in cardiorenal
and metabolic diseases research at UMMC and to provide mentoring and funding to increase their
competiveness for conducting extramurally funded basic, clinical and population research. Thus, the PPP in
Phase 3 will continue to provide mentoring as well as financial and developmental support for innovative
cardiorenal and metabolic diseases projects to further increase the number and diversity of funded CMDRC
researchers."

 This proposal requests continued support for the Molecular Endocrinology Training Program
(METP) at Vanderbilt University. Progress towards understanding and curing obesity, diabetes and
many other diseases requires the training of the next generation of scientists with expertise in
molecular endocrinology, the goal of this program. The METP comprises 29 faculty members from 5
science departments. Of this group 24 are established faculty with substantial training experience and a
track record of running well-funded programs and 5 are new investigators; 6 of these preceptors are
female and 8 are from underrepresented minority groups. The METP preceptors constitute an
unusually diverse and talented group of individuals whose work covers the spectrum of molecular
endocrinology. These preceptors conduct research in the general areas of: 1) signal transduction 2)
metabolic regulation and 3) pancreatic islet cell development and function. The request for funding of a
steady state level of 8 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral trainees is justified on the basis of the number,
size and quality of the research programs directed by the preceptors and the Institutional commitment
to continue the same level of trainee recruitment despite the tough economic climate. All METP
trainees are appointed upon the advice of a Steering Committee after being nominated by a preceptor.
Postdoctoral trainees have a Ph.D. degree. Rigorous in-depth research training is the focus of both the
pre- and postdoctoral training programs. However, the METP also ensures that all trainees receive a
broad didactic education. Predoctoral training in the METP usually follows that received in the
Interdisciplinary Graduate Program (IGP). The IGP recruits almost all predoctoral trainees in the
biomedical sciences at Vanderbilt, provides a first year core curriculum, safety training and formal
evaluation and career counseling programs. This centralized recruitment has considerably increased
the number and quality of predoctoral students that enter Vanderbilt. After four laboratory rotations
predoctoral students choose a preceptor for their thesis project and compete for METP support. The
IGP and METP have been very successful in promoting diversity and both provide ongoing training in
the Responsible Conduct of Research and Rigor. All METP trainees attend an annual METP Day
retreat, trainee-run data clubs and the Vanderbilt Diabetes Center (VDC) seminar series where they
meet with visiting scientists. In conjunction with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the METP
initiated a novel strategy to increase the recruitment of disabled individuals, specifically
undergraduates with type 1 diabetes, through the creation of a VDC-funded Summer Diabetes
Research Program. The METP has already successfully trained 173 individuals of whom 128 have gone
onto careers involving science with another 45 individuals still in training."

 This is a competitive renewal application for a Jointly Sponsored Institutional Predoctoral Training
Program in the Neurosciences (JSPTPN) for pre-thesis Ph.D. students in the Neuroscience Training Program
(NSP) at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus (CU Anschutz). The NSP is an
interdisciplinary Ph.D. granting degree started in 1986 that has been funded by this training grant since 2001.
Presently, NSP has more than 70 faculty members of whom 55 are Training Faculty on this application. NSP
aims to train stellar graduate students who develop into independent, thoughtful, and critical thinking
neuroscientists who can succeed in the 21st century. This is achieved through broad-based training in
neuroscience that includes instruction in the fundamental concepts of neuroscience, diseases of the nervous
system, experimental design and statistical methodologies, literacy in quantitative methods, and the
responsible conduct of research. Further, our plan trains graduates who are not only high caliber academic
scientists but also well-informed about various career options and professionally well-equipped. These specific
objectives are achieved through coursework, mainly in the first two years of graduate school, and research
projects in training labs. In addition, concepts that are introduced to students in coursework are reinforced and
integrated throughout the student’s time in graduate school through various enrichment activities such as
seminars and journal clubs and close mentoring by faculty during benchmark exams and Ph.D. thesis
committee meetings. Our training plan has been continually enhanced over the years, especially in the area of
quantitative methods, reflecting the Program’s identification of these skills as critical for performing high caliber
research and for competitive placement of our graduates. Our mission is also to grow and sustain a diverse
and inclusive student body. Our training plan includes multiple evaluative components to help ensure
effectiveness. These include an annual evaluation by a Neuroscience T32 Advisory Committee of senior
faculty at CU Anschutz experienced at leading training grants.
 The appointments for the Jointly Sponsored Predoctoral Training Program are for the first two years of
predoctoral training. As in the prior funding period, we seek to have six student appointees every year, split
evenly between first- and second-year students. We are requesting five years of support. The funded student
slots will help us meet the research needs of a dynamic and growing neuroscience community at CU Anschutz
and is, moreover, justified based on the demonstrated success of our prior trainees."
10744786,"Both inside the central nervous system and outside in the peripheral nervous system, cancer cells grow along
nerves as routes of invasion and metastasis called neural invasion. This growth is common in several carcinomas
including breast cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. Proteolysis of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)
occurs in development, and growing evidence suggests this post-translational modification may promote tumor
migration and invasion on nerves that ultimately leads to metastasis to the brain in various tumor types including
breast cancer. The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPµ is a CAM that is proteolyzed in cancer cells to
generate an extracellular fragment that is a unique imaging biomarker of the tumor microenvironment. The PTPµ-
targeted agents we developed bind to this biomarker and recognize human brain tumors as well as invasive
primary breast cancer and breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain. Systemic delivery of the PTPµ-
targeted agent results in binding to tumor cells within minutes in xenograft models. Using a 3D cryo-imaging
system we analyzed the extent of cell migration and dispersal within the brain. We found that the PTPµ-targeted
agent labels 99% of all dispersing tumor cells far away from the main tumor mass on nerves in mouse models.
This proposal represents the convergence of our expertise in neuroscience, cell adhesion, imaging and cancer
to test if the PTPµ biomarker can be used to detect tumor growth along nerves leading to brain metastases.
 Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have shown outstanding versatility in biomedical applications including
imaging diagnostics, drug delivery, and radiation therapy. In this proposal, we describe the development of
theranostic AuNPs for the detection and treatment of breast cancer metastases. We will achieve more sensitive
detection and treatment of invasive and metastatic lesions through the use of a three component theranostic
nanoparticle containing: 1) a highly specific targeting agent of the PTPµ biomarker in the tumor
microenvironment; 2) a protease-sensitive quenched near infrared fluorophore for fluorescent imaging; and 3) a
gold nanoparticle (AuNP) for sensitization to radiotherapy. We will test whether the PTPµ-targeted agents detects
nerve associated growth using 3D single cell resolution cryo-imaging that precisely tracks migration of individual
cancer cells on nerves. We will utilize our established human patient-derived xenograft models of metastatic
breast cancer and models that metastasize from the breast to the brain. Metastatic tumors are resistant to almost
all chemotherapeutics so “physical” killing strategies like radiation must be improved and employed for better
therapeutic outcomes. By delivering PTPµ-targeted conjugated AuNPs directly to primary and metastatic breast
cancer we will exploit the radiosensitization of AuNP to reduce the required dose of radiation needed for
radiotherapy thereby reducing collateral damage to normal surrounding tissues. We expect that these studies
will yield targeted nanoparticles that detect and treat nerve associated tumor growth while implicating CAM
proteolysis as a generalizable mechanism for detecting and treating tumor invasion on nerves."

The primary aim of this new multi-institutional summer research, educational, and professional development
training program is to prepare undergraduate students from underrepresented populations in the U.S. Biomedical
Sciences (UBR trainees) for advanced academic training in PhD and MD/PhD programs; foster their pursuit of
sleep and circadian science careers; and to promote a diverse workforce. The proposed training program is
unique as it provides UBR trainees mentoring by more than 30 faculty from NIH T32 programs in sleep and
circadian science, all of whom conduct research relevant to the mission of the NINDS. The program faculty and
advisory board also includes established URB investigators in this area nationally. Participating Institutions
include in alphabetical order: Harvard Medical School/Harvard University, Morehouse School of Medicine,
Northwestern University/Northwestern School of Medicine, Stanford University/Stanford University School of
Medicine, University of Colorado Boulder, University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania/Perelman School
of Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern, and Washington University St. Louis. The program will recruit
60 UBR trainees and provide high quality research, core educational and professional development
experiences to prepare them for careers in sleep and circadian science. The multi-institutional effort will
provide access to training in all regions across the United States creating a community of expert mentors. The
training, research, and mentoring outcomes from this R25 program will foster diversity and inclusivity in the
scientific workforce and will contribute important scientific knowledge to our understanding of these critical
biological processes."

recombined BCR with the variable genes of broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies (bNabs). Importantly, these
variable genes are placed in their respective natural loci, and – excepting the new VH and VL segments –
these edited B cells are indistinguishable from unmodified mature, naïve B cells. We describe these edited B
cells as “chimeric antigen receptor B cells”, or CAR B cells, evoking the more familiar CAR T cells.
These CAR B cells replicate, differentiate, affinity mature, and secrete antibodies in vivo providing an efficient
delivery vehicle for bNabs. CAR B cells represent a key advance over passive infusion or gene therapy
delivery of bNabs, because they do not raise anti-drug antibodies against their novel BCR, and because the
can affinity mature in response to an antigen, including HIV-1 emerging from a reactivated reservoir. They
can thus adapt in real time to the specific viral variants in the reservoir.
To date, however, we have only transformed CAR B cells ex vivo by isolating primary B cells from a particular
host, transforming them by electroporation of CRISPR/Cas RNPs and DNA repair templates, and re-infusing
the CAR B cells into the host. Although ex vivo CAR B transformation could be clinically viable, it would likely
be a prohibitively expensive procedure for most HIV-positive persons. Here we propose to perform the CAR
B transformation procedure in vivo by developing a B cell-tropic adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene
therapy vector and CRISPS/Cas editing cassette that could be administered intravenously; a comparatively
fast and inexpensive procedure.
This proposal is divided into three aims. In Aim 1, we draw upon our extensive experience modifying AAV
capsids to target specific cell types to create a B cell-tropic capsid. In Aim 2, we develop and evaluate a range
of AAV-delivered CRISPR/Cas editing cassette designs for their ability to efficiently transform CAR B cells.
Lastly, in Aim 3, we optimize an immunogen and immunization strategy to drive proliferation and affinity
maturation of newly transformed CAR B cells. These studies will make clinically viable a promising approach
for suppressing an established HIV-1 infection or preventing a new one in high-risk persons."

Suicide rates among veterans with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) are intractably high. Yet, at present available
treatments offer only minimal to limited benefits to ameliorate this risk, despite a VA-wide implementation of
enriched suicide prevention services and the availability of a national suicide hotline. This dire state represents
a serious public health concern and a critical target for interventions. In response to this state, the
Rehabilitation Research & Development Service (RR&D)’s Behavioral Health & Social Reintegration Program
has highlighted the need for development of suicide prevention interventions that enhance social reintegration,
functional outcomes, and improve overall participation in society. Germane to Social Functioning (SF),
extensive evidence from basic affective neuroscience research indicates that effective SF requires intact
emotion awareness. Speciﬁcally, emotions are posited to provide crucial information about the signiﬁcance of
social situations and help to guide potential actions to be taken to navigate such situations. Negative emotional
experiences in particular have critical informational value in signaling the need to adjust one’s current state or
activity. As different emotions may call for the use of distinct response strategies, lack of or reduced awareness
of experienced feelings may make it difﬁcult for individuals to choose response strategies for dealing effectively
with social situations, resulting in poor SF. Consistent with these findings, recent reports indicate alexithymia, a
transdiagnostic clinical syndrome characterized by poor emotion awareness, to be highly prevalent among
veteran and civilians with SMI populations, with a recent large systematic review and meta-analysis indicating
alexithymia predicting suicide ideation and behavior (with large and small effect sizes, respectively). Relatedly,
previous reports indicate alexithymia has a detrimental impact on treatment outcomes. Altogether, these
findings suggest alexithymia may play a key role in impacting suicide risk and treatment response in veterans.
Yet, despite its pervasiveness, chronic presentation, link to SMI and poor SF, and impact on clinical outcomes,
the putative impact of alexithymia on suicide risk has not been investigated in veterans with SMI at risk of
suicide. Building on these findings, the goal of this project is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel,
blended psychoeducation and digital mHealth (mobile health) intervention designed to target alexithymia and
poor SF to reduce suicide risk in veterans with SMI. Employing a proof-of-concept design, 40 participants will
attend weekly group psychoeducation sessions targeting emotion awareness and SF along with an innovative
mHealth emotion awareness skill training via smartphone to reduce alexithymia, enhance SF, and reduce
suicide risk. Results from the present study will provide comprehensive characterization of suicide risk among
veterans with SMI, provide preliminary acceptability and feasibility data, and will inform the development of a
randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of the intervention to ameliorate suicide risk in this population."
10838358,"The opioid crisis has emphasized the need for better non-addictive therapeutics for pain management. The
chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) imposed on approximately half of patients receiving
oxaliplatin treatment for cancer is a significant additional burden. While sophisticated molecular tools are now
being introduced to attack cancer and despite severe adverse effects, oxaliplatin chemotherapy remains in wide
usage as a primary treatment response at many sites. Its high prevalence of neurotoxicity often limits
chemotherapeutic dosing efficacy and maximum therapeutic effect. Patients can experience disabling cold and
mechanical hypersensitivity that persist for years after treatment. The toxic effects can cause premature
termination of treatment, impacting quality of life and survivability. CIPN can lead to permanent symptoms and
disability in up to 40% of cancer survivors subsequently, thus the societal loss in dollars is inestimable. There
are no drugs preventing development of CIPN, and CIPN has a poor therapeutic response to analgesics. Our
current collaborative effort focuses on optimizing a small molecule single chain Fragment variable antibody
(scFv) therapy that reverses chronic neuropathic pain. Smaller engineered scFvs (25-28 kDa) feature similar
binding activity but stronger tissue and brain penetrability. These small molecules are considered suitable drug
candidates for pain control since they satisfy key parameters such as (1) high affinity for the therapeutic target,
(2) high thermostability, (3) lack of aggregation, and (4) availability from high expression cell lines. Commercial
viability is dependent on humanization and affinity purification of the current patent pending small brain penetrant
scFv therapy effective in murine models. The objective of this proposal is to humanize the current small scFv
antibody and while maintaining more than 50% effectiveness in the murine CIPN pain model. The methodology
used will be to ascertain the minimum requirements for humanization, affinity maturation, and then to bench test
the antibody for effectiveness in the CIPN model vivo and in in vitro models including human-like neurons,
expression systems, and primary sensory neurons from CIPN mice to validate feasibility for continuing with
human clinical trials. Finally, we will seek independent commercial confirmation to demonstrate safety with
PK/PD, distribution, and toxicology validation studies. The ultimate objective of this project is realization of an
effective and commercially viable non-opioid treatment for chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain (CINP). The
single chain Fragment variable (scFv) antibody therapy designed would prevent CINP and/or mitigate long
standing, disabling CINP."
10788321,"Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, and it is
even more prevalent in veterans, due to military-specific exposures that increase PD risk. There is great
phenotypic variability: some PD patients present primarily with tremor and retain good quality of life for
decades whereas others demonstrate a more malignant phenotype with more rapid progression to dementia
and severe motor impairments. The ability to predict which patients will exhibit slow or fast disease progression
would be invaluable for patient counseling and for clinical trial design. To date, no biomarkers have been
identified which predict PD progression. Given that mitochondrial dysfunction is an early and consistent cellular
hallmark of the disease that tracks with disease progression, measuring mitochondrial function could prove to
be one such predictive biomarker. Two promising approaches, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging
(MRSI) and measurement of Nrf2 activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), could close this
knowledge gap.
Significance: This work addresses two high-priority areas. It makes inroads into precision medicine through its
potential for predicting disease progression and laying foundation for improving clinical trial design and
expediting translation of promising preclinical work. It also focused on a neurocognitive disorder highly
prevalent within the VA population. The VA has an older average age, males are more likely to acquire the
disease, PD is recognized as a service-connected disease, and veterans with PD are more likely to rely solely
on the VA for their health care than veterans without PD.
Innovation: This proposal is innovative because we plan to be the first to apply ultrahigh field MRSI to
measure mitochondrial function in real time in the brains of patients with PD. Extending beyond static
measurements of phosphate-containing compounds, we will also be the first to apply magnetization transfer,
giving us further insight into mitochondrial dynamics and increasing the sensitivity of our assessments. Our
work will also assess whether imaging-based measures of mitochondrial dysfunction will be able to predict
subsequent clinical changes in PD progression. If so, this would provide the first biomarker that is able to
predict progression in individuals with PD.
Specific Aims: 1) Quantify mitochondrial bioenergetics in the PD brain by applying 31P-MRSI. 2) Evaluate
PBMC Nrf2 mRNA expression and its downstream effectors in PD patients compared to controls. 3)
Assess longitudinal changes in peripheral Nrf2 levels and 31P-MRSI-based changes in brain bioenergetics in
early PD patients, to determine whether differences in mitochondrial bioenergetics predict clinical disease
progression.
Methods: A cross-sectional study of early and mid-stage patients with PD and healthy controls will undergo
MRSI and peripheral blood analysis. One year later, the controls and early PD group will repeat these
measurements.
Next Steps: By measuring mitochondrial function in vivo, this proposal will establish readouts of disease
activity which can next be used to measure target engagement in trials with mitochondria-directed
therapeutics."
10746840,"Age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and a variety
of less common disorders, affect large numbers of individuals and are largely untreatable. Novel mechanisms of
disease represent untapped potential for therapy development. Here we propose that anastasis (from the Greek,
“rising from the dead”), or recovery from terminal caspase activation, represents a new mechanism inducing
neuronal death in age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases. We present preliminary data derived from
models of Alexander disease, an exemplar primary astrocyte mediated neurodegenerative disorder, to suggest
that that anastasis drives neuronal death. We further capitalize on a valuable genome-scale genetic screen
performed in an in vivo Drosophila model of Alexander disease to define mechanisms controlling glial anastasis
and secondary non-cell autonomous neurodegeneration. We then test the hypothesis that anastasis contributes
to neurodegeneration in Drosophila models of relevant to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders. Finally, we
examine mouse models of tauopathy for markers associated with anastasis. Our studies have the potential to
define a new mechanism mediating neurodegeneration in aging-related disorders with accompanying
opportunities for development of approaches to slow the onset and progression of neurological decline."

This application is submitted in response to RFA-D-21-019: Single Cell Opioid Responses in the
Context of HIV (SCORCH) Program Expansion: CNS Data Generation for Chronic Opioid,
Methamphetamine, and/or Cocaine Exposures. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can infect
nonneuronal cells in the brain, particularly microglia, with these cells acting as a reservoir of
latent infection. HIV infection has deletions effects on the function of nonneuronal and neuronal
cells, including those cells located in brain sites relevant to cognition, emotion and motivation.
The same brain sites impacted by HIV are known to regulate the actions of opioids and other
classes of addictive drugs, and opioid use disorder (OUD) is more prevalent in HIV-infected
individuals than the general population. Moreover, HIV infection and OUD reciprocally interact,
with each condition potentially exacerbating the severity of the other. Mice infected with EcoHIV,
a modified HIV strain that targets CD4+ T cells, macrophages and microglia, recapitulates the
major pathobiological features of chronic HIV infection in individuals on antiretroviral therapy
(ART). Here, we will leverage state-of-the-art single cell sequencing (scSeq), molecular, cellular
and behavioral approaches to define cell type-specific interactions between HIV and opioids in
the brains of EcoHIV-infected mice. In Specific Aim I, we optimize the intravenous (IV) heroin
self-administration procedure, already well-established in our laboratories, for use in EcoHIV-
infected mice. We will then examine the effects of EcoHIV infection on the expression of opioid
addiction-relevant behaviors. Conversely, we will examine the effects of heroin consumption on
the expression of cognitive abnormalities in EcoHIV-infected mice relevant to HIV-associated
neurocognitive impairment (HIV-NCI) in humans. Finally, will examine the effects of ART on the
expression of addiction- and HIV-NCI-relevant behavioral abnormalities in EcoHIV-infected
mice. In Specific Aim II, we will perform scSeq on brain regions relevant to opioid addiction and
HIV-NCI, collected from EcoHIV mice with our without a history of intravenous opioid self-
administration behavior. We will investigate the effects of ART on scSeq patterns in these mice.
The scSeq data will be mined to identify cells in the brain infected by EcoHIV, and determine
which cells show the most robust transcriptional responses to EcoHIV in opioid-naïve and
opioid-experienced mice. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry will be used to validate
key findings and prioritize candidate genes for further investigation. In Specific Aim III, we will
use in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 to target prioritized genes identified in Aim II in a cell type- and brain
region-specific manner. The impact of CRISPR cleavage of prioritized genes on the expression
of addiction- and HIV-NCI-relevant behavioral abnormalities in EcoHIV-infected mice will be
examined. This innovative program of research may yield fundamental new insights into
disease-relevant interactions between HIV infection and opioid drugs."
10810802,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Protein disaggregation and turnover are essential for protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and cell viability.
Malfunction occurs during cell stress and aging, accelerating deleterious protein aggregation and amyloid
formation. Improved mechanistic understanding is critical for determining how proteostasis pathways fail and for
identifying therapeutic targets in preventing neurodegenerative disease and other protein mis-folding diseases.
Heat shock protein (Hsp) 100 members of the conserved AAA+ family serve critical functions in all life as protein
unfoldases and disaggregases. They form hexameric, ATP-driven machines that catalyze the translocation of
polypeptide substrates through a central channel. The unfolded proteins are then refolded by Hsp molecular
chaperones or degraded by an associated protease, such as in the case of the proteasome.
 Challenges in achieving structures of functional states have led to conflicting mechanistic models across
the AAA+ superfamily. Focusing on conserved Hsp100 members, yeast Hsp104 and the bacterial Clp proteins,
we have overcome these challenges by using cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of biochemically
defined, functional complexes. We determined the first substrate-bound structures of a AAA+ disaggregase
(Hsp104) in distinct translocation states and discovered these machines operate by a rotary mechanism involving
precise substrate gripping and release states and a two amino acid translocation step. Since our last submission
of this application, we have determined multiple structures of the ClpAP AAA+ protease undergoing active
substrate unfolding and proteolysis Together our discoveries reveal a new paradigm for how AAA+s
mechanically unfold substrates. The next major question to address is: How is the translocation mechanism
(which is now considered highly conserved among AAA+s) coupled to specific cellular functions? Our long-term
goal is to determine how translocation and unfolding are precisely tuned for different proteostasis and cell stress
response functions. The objective for this application is to identify key allosteric control mechanisms that couple
ATP-driven translocation to substrate recognition, unfolding and degradation. Here we will: (SA1) Determine
mechanisms of protein unfolding and proteolysis by the ClpAP “bacterial proteasome” complex; (SA2) Determine
how Hsp104 interacts with and disaggregates native substrates and amyloids; and (SA3) Determine how the
Hsp70 chaperone collaborates with Hsp104 to promote substrate loading. At the completion of this work we will
identify conformational networks and protein:protein interactions that define how the core translocation cycle
connects allosterically to specify distinct cellular functions of these AAA+ machines."
10817732,"Project Summary
Dietary vitamin K is used in virtually all tissues to convert clusters of Glus to gamma-carboxylated Glus (Glas)
in vitamin K-dependent (VKD) proteins. Carboxylation activates VKD proteins by generating a calcium-binding
module required for their function. The first VKD proteins identified were coagulation factors, which also have
signaling roles that impact other physiologies (e.g. inflammation). Additional extrahepatic VKD proteins also
regulate calcification, growth control, apoptosis and signal transduction. Defining Gla formation is therefore
essential for understanding the impact of VKD proteins on human health and disease. A single gamma-
glutamyl carboxylase generates Gla by oxygenating vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) to an epoxide (KO). KO is
then recycled by the vitamin K oxidoreductase (VKORC1) in two steps: from epoxide to vitamin K quinone, and
then quinone to hydroquinone. We showed that VKORC1 forms a dimer that is important in accomplishing
these two reactions. VKORC1 is the target of warfarin, a drug used by millions of people worldwide to control
blood clotting, for example with mechanical heart valves. We made the surprising discovery that warfarin
uncouples normal KO reduction, necessitating a second reductase during therapy to generate KH2 for VKD
protein carboxylation. The results are highly significant because extrahepatic VKD proteins may be poorly
carboxylated and dysfunctional if the second reductase is not ubiquitously expressed like VKORC1.
 We showed that a VKORC1 dimer is important to KO recycling to KH2, and our recent preliminary data
suggest that VKORC1 and the carboxylase form a complex. We hypothesize that vitamin K sequestration by
these protein-protein interactions promotes efficient vitamin K recycling. Some VKORC1 mutations cause
warfarin resistance, i.e. the requirement for higher warfarin doses to manage hemostasis, and we hypothesize
that these mutations disrupt dimer integrity. Naturally occurring carboxylase mutations cause severe bleeding,
and some mutants appear to be defective in VKORC1-carboxylase interaction. The aims in this application will
define the protein-protein interactions that make VKD protein carboxylation so efficient and what role they play
in warfarin inhibition. Aim 1 will test whether vitamin K sequestration mediates VKORC1 reduction by
identifying VKORC1 dimerization domains and testing their function in CRISPR/Cas9 edited cell lines deleted
for endogenous VKORC1. Aim 2 will test the importance of VKORC1-carboxylase association in vitamin K
recycling by determining whether human carboxylase mutations that cause severe bleeding disrupt normal
vitamin K recycling, and by studying the efficiency of vitamin K recycling in a carboxylase mutant mouse model.
Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that a quinone reductase distinct from VKORC1 supports VKD carboxylation
during warfarin therapy by testing candidate reductases we have identified in cell line models. Successful
completion of these aims will reveal the mechanisms of efficient VKD protein carboxylation, and provide
important new information for warfarin therapy."
10757441,"The American Academy of Pediatrics includes child poverty on its list of the most-dire health issues facing
children. Child poverty is a multi-determined complex problem with well-documented correlations to profound
and enduring negative effects on health and behaviors across the lifespan. Critically, there are substantial gaps
in scientific understanding of neurobehavioral mechanisms linking poverty to these outcomes, making it difficult
to tailor effective interventions to youth at risk. This project addresses this significant public health issue by
testing the effectiveness of an existing anti-poverty program, subsidized housing, on the neural correlates of
decision-making and cognitive-control in youths. Though stable housing has never been directly tested with
regard to children’s biobehavioral outcomes, there is ample ancillary data from the chronic stress literature to
suggest that housing could be leveraged to improve children’s outcomes. The general aim of the proposal is to
assess whether receipt of stable housing in childhood can attenuate deficits in cognitive processes (e.g.,
decision-making, risk-valuation, attention) contributing to poorer academic outcomes and health-related
behaviors. The project aims to determine whether means-tested public programs, namely public housing and
housing voucher programs, moderate maladaptive judgment and decision-making and examine whether stable
housing in childhood is related to longer-term outcomes such as increased academic performance and
reduced risk-taking behavior in early adolescence. This exploratory project will determine if there is sufficient
evidence to support a full scale R01 to address: (1) Developmental change in adolescents ages 12-15 years,
covering transitions when academic problems and risky behaviors emerge, (2) Discrete neurodevelopmental
mechanisms that can reveal the efficacy of housing subsidies in mitigating negative outcomes of children
growing up in poverty, (3) Characterize aspects of both brain functioning, laboratory-based behavior, and
relevant behaviors in adolescents’ actual lives, and (4) Employ sophisticated computational rigor to study these
critical questions. Because the experience of childhood/adolescent poverty is a powerful determinant of many
subsequent academic and health problems, the high risk-high gain data generated from this project have the
potential to profoundly evaluate the efficacy of family housing subsidies in the U.S, and will provide critical
information and a framework for evaluating other federally- and state-funded programs. It will do so by
highlighting differences in key cognitive processes in the brain necessary for academic achievement and
effective decision-making in adolescence and beyond. The project holds potential to open pathways for new
research that defines and specifies mechanistic ways in which the environment creates long-term effects on
brain and behavior. These foci hold tremendous promise for advancement of knowledge and application to
improvement of public health."

Sclerostin is a potent inhibitor of bone formation and has been shown to be a valuable drug
target for treating osteoporosis. Mechanistically, sclerostin functions by binding to LRP5/6 on
the osteoblast lineage cells to antagonize canonical Wnt signaling, thus negatively regulates
bone formation. Presumably, after sclerostin is secreted by osteocytes, they reach the target
osteoblasts at the bone surfaces by diffusion. However, to date it remains unknown how
secreted sclerostin is regulated on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. To address
this significant gap in sclerostin biology, we focus our study on sclerostin–heparan sulfate (HS)
interaction. HS, a universal glycosaminoglycan found at the cell surface and in the extracellular
matrix, is known to bind sclerostin and might regulate the bioactivity and diffusion of sclerostin.
Our central hypothesis is that HS can regulate the biological functions of sclerostin in bone
formation. To test this hypothesis, our overall objective here is to elucidate how HS interacts
with sclerostin and how HS–sclerostin interaction regulates bone formation. We plan to pursue
the following two specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the biological significance of HS–sclerostin
interactions in vitro. We postulate that HS helps concentrate sclerostin on the osteoblast cell
surface and facilitates the binding of sclerostin to its receptor LRP5/6 by forming ternary
complex. We also hypothesize that HS serves a storage depot of sclerostin on the cell surface
of osteocytes after it is secreted, and protects it from proteolytic degradation. We will manipulate
HS–sclerostin interactions biochemically at the surface of both osteoblasts and osteocytes to
determine the mechanisms by which HS regulates the function of sclerostin in these cellular
contexts. Aim 2. Determine the role of HS–sclerostin interaction in bone formation in vivo. Our
working hypothesis is that dampening HS–sclerostin interactions impairs the inhibitory potency
of sclerostin towards LRP5/6, which leads to enhanced bone formation. Using a novel sclerostin
knock-in mouse strain, we will examine the consequence of altering HS–sclerostin interactions
in bone formation in vivo. Our contribution will be significant because we will identify multiple
molecular mechanisms by which HS regulates sclerostin and elucidate how such interactions
regulate bone formation. Results from the proposed experiments will substantially advance our
understanding of the cellular regulation of sclerostin on both osteoblasts and osteocytes by
elucidating the role of HS in the system. Importantly, these results are expected to have positive
translational impact because by identifying how HS regulates the bioavailability of sclerostin, we
may be able to provide new perspective for manipulating sclerostin in bone diseases."

 Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent an important class of biologic therapeutics that can
treat COVID-19, cancer and other infectious diseases. Despite their promising potential, pro-
cessing, storage and/or administration of mAbs into patients is challenging because the presence
of hydrophobic interfaces during processing and administration (air entrapment in the IV bags
or the oil-water interface at the interior of syringes) may promote mAb adsorption to such hy-
drophobic interfaces. If mAbs change their native (folded) higher order structures (HOS) upon
adsorption to these interfaces, their quality, safety and efficacy will be affected, posing immuno-
genicity risks to already susceptible patients. The first step in mitigating these risks is to evaluate
the in situ HOS of mAbs (whether folded or unfolded) at hydrophobic interfaces. Determining the
in situ structure of mAbs at such interfaces has been a major challenge due to limitations of bulk
scale or scattering-based microstructural probing techniques. In this program, we will go beyond
such limits and use a combination of a unique molecular probing technique based on NMR spec-
troscopy and dynamic surface tensiometry to resolve the details of mAbs HOS and adsorption
kinetics at hydrophobic interfaces. In particular, by using high-field spatially and spectrally re-
solved NMR spectroscopy that is uniquely available to use through National High Magnetic Field
Laboratory, we will assess dynamically 1) the in situ HOS of pure mAbs at hydrophobic interfaces,
and 2) nature of their associations with surfactants at interfaces. We will perform tensiometry
along with NMR spectroscopy on pure mAbs, isotopically labeled mAbs and mAbs/surfactant
combinations at hydrophobic interfaces. We will measure a) dynamic surface tension, b) spa-
tially localized chemical shifts in 1D 1H and 2D 1H-13C NMR spectra, c) diffusion coefficients of
the mAbs, and d) T2 relaxation of mAbs in the bulk and at the interface under different conditions
(e.g., various mAbs and surfactant concentrations, solution pH and ionic strengths). By compar-
ing the results of the bulk and interface in terms of metrics (a-d), the team will determine if the
native HOS of mAbs has been altered by adsorption to hydrophobic interfaces or their associa-
tions with surfactants. The outcome of this study will provide the first mechanistic understanding
of mAbs HOS at hydrophobic interfaces. Additionally, the knowledge gained from this research
is essential in developing a framework to mitigate mAbs adsorption to hydrophobic interfaces,
which can be subsequently utilized to improve efficacious mAb deployment for patients.

Auditory hallucinations associated with schizophrenia (Sz) are pervasive, debilitating, and disturbing.
Unfortunately, they are also difficult to treat – auditory hallucinations persist in about 25% of cases despite
pharmacotherapy1 and treatment of cognitive symptoms (the symptoms most strongly related to global
functioning) is modest at best. We propose a novel, inexpensive, and noninvasive intervention to address
treatment-refractory symptoms, a critical need in Sz. Auditory hallucinations and impaired cognition in
schizophrenia are not independent. Both are associated with system-level dysfunction of the fronto-temporal
auditory control network, comprising auditory/verbal perceptual areas in temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and
cognitive/behavioral control systems in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). VLPFC traditionally inhibits and
reattributes perceptual misrepresentations in most people2. For those with schizophrenia, impairment of auditory
cognitive control makes this impossible. Data from our lab suggest that auditory control network dysfunction may
be central to the early etiology of the disorder3. Auditory control enhancement (ACE) is designed to improve
auditory control network function, thereby increasing inhibition of spurious auditory system activity in
temporoparietal cortex and reducing auditory hallucinations. ACE combines a time-tested psychotherapeutic
behavioral training program with targeted non-invasive brain stimulation using transcranial Direct Current
Stimulation (tDCS). Our pilot data demonstrate the effectiveness of the behavioral training program and
synergistic effects with tDCS of the auditory control network for treating treatment-refractory auditory
hallucinations in schizophrenia. To further develop ACE for efficacy trials, we plan to investigate neural markers
of target engagement in two sham-controlled experiments. Aim 1 will determine whether tDCS of right vlPFC
(anode) and left TPJ (cathode) during MRI alters electric field measures and blood oxygenation level dependent
(BOLD) response during stimulation to demonstrate that markers of tDCS current flow and BOLD fluctuate with
induced current, and these fluctuations align spatially with computer models. Aim 2 will examine feasibility of
subject retention and blinding for ACE. Aim 3 will examine the degree to which ACE modifies behavioral,
neurophysiological, and hemodynamic markers of target engagement using neural oscillatory and cerebral blood
flow (CBF) measures. Pilot data show feasibility of our aims and provide preliminary evidence that ACE has
strong and lasting effects on auditory hallucinations assessed with the psychotic symptoms rating scale
(PSYRATS), and that changes in cognitive factors associated with auditory hallucinations strongly correlate with
changes in neural oscillatory measures of cognitive control. ACE represents a novel, transformative intervention
with long-lasting effects that has the potential to change the treatment of schizophrenia and vastly improve the
outcome for afflicted individuals."
10739802,"Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sgg) is a medically important gut pathobiont that causes
life-threatening bacteremia and infective endocarditis (IE) and promotes colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the
molecular mechanisms underlying Sgg pathogenicity remain poorly understood. The pathogenic process of Sgg
(previously known as S. bovis biotype I) involves colonizing the colon, influencing the colonic epithelium
homeostasis and barrier integrity, and disseminating from the gut to the circulatory system to cause bacteremia
and IE. Our long-term goals are to understand how this organism colonizes the colon, how it affects gut epithelial
homeostasis and integrity, and how to use the knowledge to mitigate Sgg-induced pathologies. This application
will investigate a novel mechanism that mediates Sgg adherence to the colonic epithelium.
 Previous studies suggest that Sgg adherence to colonic epithelial cells facilitates gut colonization24,25, and
is linked to its ability to promote cell proliferation13 and to translocate23. Thus, adherence to the colonic
epithelium is a critical early step in the pathogenic process of Sgg, however, the current mechanistic
understanding of Sgg adherence is limited. Additional adherence mechanisms remain to be elucidated to fill a
major knowledge gap.
 The hypothesis of this proposal is that two components of a type VII secretion system (T7SS) of Sgg
collaboratively mediate the adherence of Sgg to the colonic epithelium by targeting a specific host cell receptor.
T7SS is a specialized secretion system known to mediate pathogen interactions with the host. It has been shown
to be important for the virulence and persistence of other pathogens. The Xu lab recently reported the first
functional characterization of a T7SS in Sgg strain TX20005 (T7SST05) and demonstrated that this T7SS is a
pathogenicity determinant of Sgg. In particular, deletion of core components of the T7SST05 secretion machinery
resulted in significantly reduced capacity to adhere to colonic epithelial cells and to colonize the colon in vivo.
The objectives of this proposal are to define the role of the T7SST05 components in adherence to the colonic
epithelium (Aim 1) and to determine the host cell surface receptor targeted by Sgg for adherence (Aim 2). Given
the limited mechanistic understanding of Sgg pathogenicity, the proposed work will provide crucial
breakthroughs in identifying novel molecular players that mediate Sgg colonization of the colonic epithelium,
thereby fill a major knowledge gap. Furthermore, the specific Sgg factors identified in this work are candidates
for diagnostic biomarkers and clinical intervention targets, and therefore have translational potential."
10754968,"Multipotent stem/stromal cells (MSC) are promising candidate therapeutics for HIV infection, given their potent
immunomodulatory properties and wide safety margins. It remains unknown if MSC can reverse CD8 T cell
exhaustion and promote trafficking of CD8 T cells into privileged sites during chronic HIV infection. Thus, there
is a critical need to determine whether CD8 T cell exhaustion can be therapeutically targeted by MSC. Our
long-term goal is to define mechanisms of MSC-induced immune-modulation during chronic viral infections so
that improved therapeutic strategies be developed. Our overall objective in this application is to determine if
MSC treatment can enhance viral clearance via reversal of exhausted CD8 T cells in chronic SIV-infected
macaques. Our central hypothesis is that systemic infusions of allogeneic MSC enhance viral clearance in
ART-naïve, and delay viral rebound upon ART interruption in ART-treated SIV-infected macaques, via reversal
of CD8 T cell exhaustion and infiltration of privileged sites. The rationale that underlies the proposed research
is that CD8 T cell exhaustion and viral sequestration are major mechanisms of HIV viral persistence that may
be targeted with MSC treatment. To test our hypothesis we will use the SIV-infected non-human primate model
of AIDS. SIV-infected animals will be treated with a combination of ART and/or MSC and samples from
peripheral blood, gut tissue, and lymph nodes will be collected during necropsies. The central hypothesis will
be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of MSC treatment on exhausted CD8 T cell
populations in rhesus macaques chronically infected with SIV. Our working hypothesis is that MSC treatment
reverses CD8 T cell exhaustion that is driven by chronic SIV infection. We will sort CD8 T cells from blood, gut
tissue, and lymph nodes and perform single-cell RNAseq analysis, multi-color flow cytometry, and ex-vivo
stimulation assays. 2) Determine the impact of MSC treatment on CD8 T cell trafficking into lymphoid follicles
in rhesus macaques chronically infected with SIV. Our working hypothesis is that MSC treatment in chronic
SIV-infected macaques enhances CXCR5+/CD8 T cell trafficking into B-cell follicles. We will determine the
micro-anatomical distribution and phenotype of SIV-specific CD8 T cells and viral reservoirs in gut tissue and
lymph nodes via in situ MHC-tetramer, and immunohistochemistry staining, and confocal microscopy. The
research proposed in the application is innovative because it explores a new therapeutic paradigm of targeting
multiple mechanisms of HIV persistence concurrently on multiple mechanistic levels. The proposed research is
significant because HIV/AIDS remains a significant global health crisis that is partially driven by viral
persistence despite effective antiretroviral therapy and suppression of viral replication. Moreover, as CD8 T cell
exhaustion has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple other chronic viral diseases and malignancies,
findings stemming from this study have the potential to impact broadly and deeply. Findings from this study are
directly translatable as MSC are readily available for clinical trials."
10738784,"This is a resubmission of a Career Development Award (CDA) application by Dr. Nicholas Wettersten,
mentored by Dr. Joachim Ix at the VA San Diego Health System (VASDHS). Through this proposal Dr.
Wettersten intends to establish himself as an independent investigator studying acute heart failure (AHF),
cardiorenal syndrome, and biomarkers.
Candidate: Dr. Wettersten’s training objectives are designed to parallel his research project and provide skills
required to lead an independent VA Merit Award upon completion of his CDA. These include: learning
biostatistics for interpretation and analysis of multiple biomarkers concurrently, develop skills for designing and
implementing clinical trials, and develop skills for scientific writing and independent lab management. Dr.
Wettersten will achieve these objectives through coursework, workshops, and mentorship. His mentorship
committee includes Dr. Joachim Ix (primary mentor), an expert in heart-kidney disease interaction, and co-
mentors Dr. Kirk Hammond, an expert in clinical trials and translational research at the VASDHS, Dr. Patrick
Murray, an expert in acute kidney injury and biomarkers at University College Dublin, and Dr. Florin Vaida, an
expert biostatistician at UCSD.
Research: AHF accounts for almost 1 million hospitalizations annually with significant morbidity and mortality.
Approximately 350,000 Veterans suffer from heart failure with an annual mortality of almost 15%. Periods of
AHF are an especially vulnerable period of heightened morbidity and mortality. Up to one-third of AHF patients
will experience a rise in serum creatinine (sCr) with diuretics. This rise in sCr could be from true kidney injury
or a benign reversible hemodynamic effect. Currently, clinicians have no means to distinguish these scenarios.
Recently, a panel of urine kidney biomarkers of injury and dysfunction has been shown to discriminate the rise
in sCr with intensive blood pressure lowering as hemodynamic vs. injury. This same process may occur in
AHF, but this panel has not been tested in AHF. This proposal will leverage the Acute Kidney Injury N-gal
Evaluation of Symptomatic Heart Failure Study (AKINESIS), a well-characterized study of 927 patients
presenting with AHF and with repeat urine specimens available during treatment, as well as conduct an
observational pilot study from admission into the post-discharge period of AHF patients admitted to the VASD
hospital, to address the following specific aims: 1) To determine if admission values of urinary kidney tubule
function and injury biomarkers associate with risk of adverse outcomes among AHF patients beyond admission
sCr, 2) to determine whether changes in urinary kidney tubule function and injury biomarkers during
hospitalization for AHF are more strongly associated with mortality and HF readmission than changes in sCr,
and 3) to assess trajectories of urine kidney tubule function and injury biomarkers with changes in patient
volume status during hospitalization and the first 30 days after discharge among AHF patients prospectively
enrolled at the SDVA hospital. These findings will advance the understanding of renal function in AHF and will
lead directly to randomized intervention studies to determine if modifying AHF treatment based on kidney
biomarkers may improve re-hospitalizations and other outcomes in AHF patients."
10818333,"Summary
Therapeutic resistance and tumor relapse present as major barriers to achieving a definitive cure for cancer.
This challenge is especially relevant for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), who are largely
diagnosed at advanced stages and face low survival odds. Recent studies have revealed that tumors are
complex ecosystems consisting of coexisting subclonal populations that each harbor a unique genomic
landscape. Indeed, tumors are constantly adapting in response to external perturbations such as therapeutics,
and clones capable of surviving treatment are evidence of evolved resistance to therapeutics and may provide
the foundation for relapse.
 While the role of mitochondria in tumors has been largely neglected, recent studies have demonstrated
that OXPHOS can contribute to treatment resistance as well as several other processes such as invasion and
metastatization. Here, we will leverage out our novel Clonal Replica Tumors (CRTs) platform to test the
hypothesis that heterogenous mitochondrial activity across different clonal lineages plays a central role
in determining tumor response to therapy, and thus contributes to the development of therapeutic
resistance and tumor relapse in PDAC. Our CRT platform enables the testing of multiple pharmacological
disruptors or other external factors in parallel in animals bearing patient-derived xenotransplanted (PDX) tumors
with identical clonal composition. This approach allows us to explore how intra-tumor mitochondria functional
diversity is shaped by genomic heterogeneity as well as whether and how this diversity contributes to therapeutic
resistance. By focusing on treatment-naïve subclonal lineages with distinct responses to therapy isolated from
early passage pancreatic cancer PDXs, we will investigate the following aims: 1) explore the role of genomic
heterogeneity in shaping mitochondria functional diversity and define mitochondrial molecular
signatures that predict treatment response; 2) elucidate the role of mitochondria in mediating
pharmacological resistance; 3) determine the effects of targeting mitochondria on tumor clonal
architecture and construct a 3D map of tumor resistance. Ultimately, we will explore the therapeutic benefits
of targeting mitochondria to prevent therapeutic resistance and relapse in pancreatic cancer.
 We are confident that our study is responsive to the NIH/NCI mission to improve patient outcomes, as it
addresses fundamental questions about how intratumoral mitochondria heterogeneity and distinct mitochondrial
phenotypes influence treatment response to drugs and sustain tumor relapse. We further anticipate that our
research will have an immediate translational impact through the identification of new biomarkers that can be
used to identify patients who may benefit from the OXPHOS inhibitors currently under clinical investigation."
10812355,"Accidental exposure to chlorine (Cl2) causes potentially fatal lung injury accompanied, in survivors, by reactive
airway disease and pulmonary fibrosis resembling symptoms typical of the acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). Our preliminary data also document that the mitochondrial genome–the integrity of which is critical to
maintenance of normal bioenergetics and mitochondrial signaling activities– displays oxidative damage after Cl2
gas exposure, similar to that detected in other models of acute and chronic lung injury. Against this background,
here we propose to test the hypothesis that an early molecular target in Cl2 gas inhalation is the
mitochondrial (mt) genome, in which oxidative damage functions as a molecular sentinel leading to
activation of pro-inflammatory pathways that drive acute lung injury and progressive lung remodeling.
To address this hypothesis we will perform the following in vivo and in vitro studies outlined in the following three
aims: Aim 1. Define the kinetics of lung oxidative mtDNA damage in mice exposed to Cl2 gas and returned to
room air and test whether a novel agent to augmenting mtDNA injury decreases mortality and the severity of
acute and chronic lung injury. Exp. 1.1 will determine the time course of Cl2 gas-induced lung mtDNA damage
and its relation to lung pathophysiology in global (mitochondrial and nuclear) OGG1 knockout mice (OGG1-/-)
and their wild type (WT) controls (C57BL/6), along with OGG1 KO mice reconstituted with mito-targeted OGG1
(OGG1-/-+OGG1mt), while Exp. 1.2 will test if intranasal administration of mitoOGG1 at selected time points after
termination of Cl2 exposure decreases lung injury pulmonary fibrosis and improves survival. Aim 2: Test the
hypothesis that Cl2 gas-induced lung mtDNA damage triggers mobilization of mtDNA Damage Associated
Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) that drive nucleic acid-dependent inflammation and serve as biomarkers and
causative agents of pneumotoxicity. In Exp. 2.1 will use WT, OGG1-/-, and OGG1-/-+OGG1mt mice to test the
hypothesis that OGG1 activity coordinately regulates Cl2 gas-induced mtDNA DAMP accumulation and activation
of nucleic acid receptor-mediated pro-inflammatory pathways. Aim 3: Determine key cellular mechanisms by
which Cl2 gas causes mtDNA damage-dependent lung cell death and dysfunction. In Exp. 3.1 we will isolate
alveolar macrophages (AM) and lung epithelial type II cells (ATII) from WT, OGG1-/-, and OGG1-/-+OGG1mt
mice, and measure oxygen consumption rate, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, ion
transport and key indices of cell injury prior to and following exposure to Cl2 gas. Additionally, Exp. 3.2 will define
the mtDNA damage-dependent trafficking of mtDNA DAMPs to cytosolic and extracellular compartments and
determine how these two mtDNA DAMP pools interact to dictate pro-inflammatory nucleic acid receptor
activation. As part of this experiment, we also will determine if exogenous mtDNA DAMPs recapitulate nucleic
acid receptor activation and inflammation evoked by Cl2 and use Dnase1 to degrade extracellular mtDNA DAMPs
to define the specific effect of mtDNA DAMPs originating from this compartment."
10868769,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are typically aggressive cancers with shorter median time to relapse and
death than other breast cancers. Because these cancers are defined by the absence of a target, identification
of tailored therapies has been challenging. However, immune therapy shows important promise in TNBC,
including the first FDA approval for immunotherapy in breast cancer and favorable response data for the
addition of immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Recent evidence suggests that tumor molecular
characteristics may provide clues to both the different etiology and prognoses for TNBCs. Gene expression
studies revealed that TNBCs are heterogeneous and composed of finer subtypes, defined in part by immune
response signatures. It has been hypothesized that the patients’ immune response plays an important role in
determining tumor progression. Further, sequencing studies have identified a set of genes that are frequently
mutated in breast tumors and several mutational signatures that reflect distinct mutagenic processes, and may
have etiologic implications. The mutational signatures that have been identified in TNBCs are distinct from the
more common luminal breast cancers, highlighting the need for research specific to this subtype.
 We propose to perform whole exome sequencing (WES) of matched tumor and germline DNA samples
from 400 TNBC patients from four prospective cohort studies, the Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study
II, Cancer Prevention Study II, and Cancer Prevention Study 3. In combination with our existing rich database
of germline GWAS, breast cancer risk factors, and tumor immune signatures, we are well positioned to better
understand how genetic and nongenetic risk factors influence breast tumor mutational signatures, immune
response and prognosis. We will assess the association of genetic and nongenetic risk factors with tumor
mutational profiles (Aim 1), and tumor immune profiles (Aim 2). We will also examine the association between
immune response signatures and tumor mutation profiles (Aim 3). In exploratory analyses, we will evaluate
whether a possible joint effect of somatic mutational signatures and immune response signatures are
associated with breast cancer-specific survival (Aim 4). Knowledge from this study will be extremely valuable in
developing prevention strategies and treatment targets for these aggressive tumors.
 To complete these aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in breast cancer
epidemiology, genetic epidemiology, statistical genetics, bioinformatics, immuno-oncology, and tumor
genomics. The Principal Investigators have extensive experience with the cohort resources and have worked
collaboratively for over thirteen years. We have also partnered with the B-CAST and AMBER consortia to
create a large and diverse repository of WES data from TNBCs, which will enable us to both replicate our
results and compare mutational profiles and their associations with prediagnostic and clinical factors in
European-ancestry and African American women."
10791937,"SUMMARY
 Congenital defects are a leading cause of morbidity worldwide, accounting for the deaths of 330,000 new-
born every year. Brain malformations appear to be the most common congenital anomalies and are a major
cause of death and lifelong disability. In the majority of cases the cause remains uncertain, due to the complexity
and the multi-genic origin of these anomalies. Genes encoding Transcription Factors (TFs) and epigenetic
regulators have become relevant candidates given the central role of these proteins in integrating signalling
cascades and orchestrating multiple biological processes. Deficiency in their function may disturb entire
transcriptional programs, involving several genes and molecular pathways.
 Here we combine mouse genetics and epigenomic approaches to uncover the role of PRDM15, a previously
unsuspected disease-associated epigenetic regulator, in congenital brain malformations. Moreover, by
functionally characterizing PRDM15 downstream effectors (e.g. NOTCH and WNT/PCP pathways) we uncover
hitherto underappreciated genes mutated in patients with brain malformations (i.e. HPE and microcephaly).
 Preliminary data: We have characterized the function of PRDM15 in regulating the mouse naïve ESC state.
We have then expanded our findings to demonstrate that, in vivo, PRDM15 depletion leads to: 1) embryonic
lethality at E12.5-E14.5; 2) patterning defects affecting Anterior/Posterior patterning and forebrain development.
In particular we have observed a failure to properly form the Axial Mesendoderm (AME), an embryonic structure
necessary for proper anterior specification; 3) Finally, in collaboration with the groups of M.Muenke (NIH) and
F.Hildebrandt (Harvard), we have identified heterozygous and homozygous mutations in PRDM15 linked to
Holoprocensephaly (HPE) and microcephaly, respectively and mutations in over 100 PRDM15-regulated genes
(~20% likely to be damaging) in a large cohort of HPE patients (132 trios and 188 singletons).
 In AIM1 we propose to define the molecular basis of PRDM15 function, specifically to understand how it
regulates, at the level of chromatin, the transcriptional program driving forebrain development. Next, in AIM2 we
will establish a causative link between human PRDM15 mutations, HPE-associated genetic variants identified
as PRDM15-transcriptional targets, and the associated spectrum of brain malformations (ranging from HPE, to
Microcephaly).
 The significance of these studies is that PRDM15 is a so far uncharacterized critical regulator of embryonic
development and knowledge of the downstream regulated pathways will be useful to the field of regenerative
medicine and will have diagnostic and clinical implications for patients with holoprosencephaly and microcephaly.
 The clinical Impact of these studies is that given the multigenic origin of HPE, targeted sequencing of
PRDM15, and its key downstream targets, can potentially be added to routine genetic testing in families at risk
of carrying other HPE-causing mutations (e.g. SHH, ZIC2, TGIF)."

Assistive robots have the potential to enhance individual autonomy, reduce human burden, and lower
healthcare costs associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer’s dementia (AD), and mobility
impairments in older adults, family care partners, and professional caregivers. StretchTM is a robot designed to
support everyday activities through use of a lightweight telescoping arm mounted on a mobile base. This
Phase II SBIR proposal builds on a successful Phase I project (R43AG072982) awarded to Hello Robot and
the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, wherein we conducted participatory design research to develop
and test a suite of tasks that the Stretch assistive robot can perform to support independence, enhance safety,
and improve quality of life for older adults. We identified the specific characteristics of the tasks for which older
adults need support in their homes; designed end effector tools for Stretch to facilitate performance of these
tasks; and designed an easy-to-use interface to control Stretch to carry out these tasks. In this Phase II
proposal we partner with ClarkLindsey Life Plan Community to broaden the set of tasks Stretch can perform,
focusing on two general categories of tasks (cognitive and physical) to support the needs of older adults with
cognitive impairment (MCI/early AD) and/or mobility impairment. We will refine the remote control interface to
be usable for professional caregivers and family care partners and develop a suite of autonomous activities
that Stretch can carry out. We will explore the functional utility of Stretch in a range of home environments,
including common rooms with multiple people. These efforts will yield a scalable, affordable, flexible Stretch
Cognitive and Physical Assistant that can improve the quality of life for older adults with a range of cognitive
and physical impairments. The research objectives will be accomplished through the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Refine and broaden the functional capabilities of Stretch to support older adults with a range of
cognitive impairments and physical impairments. Aim 2: Advance the design of the user interfaces for each
stakeholder group: older adults with cognitive and physical impairments, professional caregivers, and family
care partners. Integrate remotely initiated tasks with autonomous task performance. Aim 3: Conduct
embedded evaluations in naturalistic settings. This Phase II proposal directly meets multiple aspects of the NIH
PAS-19-316 to develop “New technologies for in-home use or for coordination or delivery of services to sustain
in-home living for individuals with MCI or AD/ADRD;” to design “Assistive robotics technology that can support
a person in order to maintain or improve her/his independence, safety, and well-being when diagnosed with
AD/ADRD and alleviate the burden of care;” and to develop “Novel technologies to monitor, assist, or maintain
daily functioning of older individuals with AD/ADRD and other cognitive impairments.” The Stretch Cognitive
and Physical Assistant robot has tremendous potential to support everyday home activities for older adults with
MCI, AD, and/or mobility impairments, providing them with autonomy and increased quality of life."
10974148,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Actively involving informal caregivers in direct patient care at the bedside in the intensive care
unit (ICU) has the potential to improve patient, informal caregiver, and health care system
outcomes. Practice guidelines call for the liberal inclusion of informal caregivers as active
partners in ICU care, but there is a critical, unmet need to develop tools that effectively
operationalize safe and effective caregiver involvement. Our solution, ICU-CARE employs a
user-centered design, providing informal caregivers with: 1) a virtual tour and education specific
to the ICU environment, 2) interactive educational modules that teach caregivers how to assess
and manage common symptoms of ICU patients with evidenced-based nonpharmacologic
interventions, and 3) an electronic platform for caregivers to record and track their contributions
to patient care. The long-term goal of this STTR project is to commercialize an easy-to-use
mobile application that improves the efficiency of day-to-day informal caregiving, facilitates
symptom management decisions, and enhances clinical communication among patients,
caregivers, and health care providers in the ICU. In Phase I, we will revise and optimize ICU-
CARE (Aim 1) by analyzing data from current users of the ICU-CARE alpha version to identify
the essential elements of the graphical user interface and educational content. We will use our
findings to create a beta version. For Aim 2, we will integrate ICU-CARE with our electronic
health record (EHR) system by creating an application programing interface (API). Finally, in
Aim 3, we will recruit a purposeful sample of ICU informal caregivers and ICU nurses to
participate in task-driven simulations to evaluate preliminary usability, feasibility, and
acceptability of ICU-CARE, as well as validate our API connection within an EHR test
environment. In Phase II, the team will conduct a fully powered two-group feasibility randomized
controlled trial of ICU-CARE versus attention control with a 1-month follow-up. Results from this
trial will further determine the app’s feasibility and acceptability as well as test efficacy. The
commercial opportunity lies in becoming the standard of care for addressing patients’ symptom
needs as well as improving the effectiveness of informal caregiving for over 5 million ICU
patients and caregivers per year in the United States."
10781960,"Sudden and/or arrhythmic death (SAD), which typically results from lethal ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular
tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, VT/VF) in the setting of coronary heart disease (CHD), afflicts an
estimated 310,000 persons annually in the United States. Reductions in SAD have continued to lag those
observed for other coronary heart disease (CHD) outcomes despite advances in resuscitation therapies and
the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Current approaches to SAD prevention remain
centered on placing ICDs in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <30-35% – even though the
majority of SAD occurs in the setting of LVEF >30-35%. In effect, the proportionately larger segment of the
at-risk population has been understudied and thus undertreated. Despite this unmet need, there remain very
few, if any, prospective studies examining SAD risk prediction in individuals with CHD and LVEF >30-35% over
a long enough time horizon where ICD therapy might be cost-effective. For this very reason, the PRE-
DETERMINE Cohort Study was intentionally designed to address this scientific gap and prospectively
study clinically relevant approaches to SAD risk prediction in CHD patients with LVEF >30-35%. In this
application, we propose to leverage the originally NHLBI-funded base cohort resource to continue adjudication
of accruing SAD and VT/VF events, in addition to competing causes of death, to attain 10+ years of endpoint
adjudication to enable the development and validation of multi-marker SAD risk prediction models based on
combinations of multi-dimensional clinical, ECG, imaging, biomarker, and genetic data generated in this unique
multicenter cohort of 5761 CHD patients. We will also leverage the base cohort to interrogate novel fatty acid
derived eicosanoids and putative arrhythmia modulating proteomic analytes in relation to risk for SAD and
competing causes of mortality in patients with CHD. Novel methods of competing risk analyses will be used to
integrate absolute and proportional SAD risk into SAD risk prediction models and to elucidate separate
associations between SAD vs. non-SAD causes of death. Machine learning approaches will be applied to
uncover inter-relations and latent features from multi-modality data not easily detected by conventional models.
An overarching goal of our work is to accurately identify those individual subsets of the broader population who
have sufficiently high absolute and proportional risk for SAD that they warrant inclusion in randomized trials of
primary prevention ICD therapy. The aims of the current proposal also offer new opportunities to identify
potential mechanistic pathways underlying the genesis of lethal ventricular arrhythmias that could serve as
novel targets for SAD prevention – extending beyond ICD placement – in patients with CHD and possibly even
in the general population wherein CHD underlies most SAD events. The continuation and expansion of the
PRE-DETERMINE study will provide the scientific field with a one-of-a kind resource for investigators and
trainees collaborating toward the common goal of reducing the burden of SAD."

A unique animal model of glaucoma with spontaneously arising mutation in LTBP2 has been established. This
gene is implicated in heterogeneous glaucoma phenotypes, including human primary congenital glaucoma
(PCG) as well as some forms of adult-onset open angle glaucoma. As the only known large animal homolog of
inherited glaucoma in humans, this model has considerable potential for translational research. Posterior
segment pathology has been extensively characterized and closely recapitulates features of human
glaucomatous optic neuropathy. However, the role played by LTBP2 in the eye remains unknown and the
precise cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the underlying elevated intraocular pressure (IOP)
in this form of glaucoma remain unresolved. The objective of this proposal is to identify and localize, as
potential targets for therapeutic intervention, key pathobiological mechanisms that contribute to both early
onset and progressive IOP elevation in this model. In addition to perturbing LTBP2’s acknowledged role in
microfibril assembly, enhanced TGF beta signaling, contributing to extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation
within the trabecular meshwork (TM) has been proposed as a mechanism for IOP elevation in this
“microfibrillopathy”. However, preliminary studies in our animal model have not established whether significant
increase in aqueous humor TGF beta concentrations represent a cause or effect of IOP elevation. Our central
hypothesis is that LTBP2 is both an important regulator of outflow pathway development and remodeling in the
perinatal period and a regulator of TM cell and ECM biology and pro-fibrotic pathways throughout life,
extending beyond development. We will pursue two specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine the effects of absent
or reduced LTBP2 expression on development of proximal and distal aqueous outflow pathways, we will test
the hypothesis that LTBP2 plays an important role in outflow pathway development and remodeling using a
combination of in vivo and in situ approaches to examine distal outflow morphology and ultrastructure of the
proximal outflow pathway (TM and juxtacanalicular tissue) and ECM components of these pathways in wildtype
and LTBP2+/- and LTBP2-/- eyes. Aim 2: To determine the pathological effects of absent or reduced LTBP2
expression on TM cell (TMC) biology, we will use TMC cultures derived from wildtype, LTBP2+/- and LTBP2-/-
eyes. In Aim 2, we will test the hypotheses that reduced LTBP2 expression will a) negatively impact TMC
attachment and proliferation in vitro and b) enhance the pathologic effects of TGFβ on actin cytoskeleton and
promotion of ECM fibrosis. Successful completion of these Aims will generate new knowledge on the complex
role of LTBP2 in physiology and pathology of the aqueous outflow pathways, providing a critical foundation to
advance our overall goal of designing and testing innovative therapeutic approaches to glaucoma in our unique
translational model."

Despite significant overall progress in improving access to dental care among children in the United States in
recent decades, substantial disparities in oral health have persisted among publicly insured children. Although
Medicaid provides comprehensive dental coverage for all enrolled children, dental benefits for adults are
optional and vary across states and over time. There is evidence that reducing Medicaid adult dental benefits
(MADB) lowers access to dental care for low-income adults. However, the impact of changes in MADB on
access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children is not yet understood.
Our long-term goal is to improve access to dental care and oral health outcomes among children in low-income
families. To achieve this goal, we will leverage natural experiments in states that changed MADB generosity to
examine the spillover effect on dental utilization by Medicaid-enrolled children. We hypothesize that expanding
MADB generosity results in increases in both preventive and overall dental utilization and a decline in
emergency department visits for dental problems by Medicaid-enrolled children. Using a causal inference
approach, we will estimate the longitudinal impact of changes in MADB on children’s dental care utilization
through these research aims:
Aim 1: Determine the impact of changes in MADB generosity on overall dental utilization by children
enrolled in Medicaid using administrative data with a quasi-experimental design.
Aim 2: Determine the impact of changes in MADB generosity on preventive dental utilization by children
enrolled in Medicaid using administrative data with a quasi-experimental design.
Aim 3: Determine the impact of changes in MADB generosity on emergency department (ED) dental
utilization by children enrolled in Medicaid using administrative data with a quasi-experimental design.
Using administrative data, we will generate monthly estimates of these three measures of utilization and use a
causal inference framework to assess the changes in child dental utilization trends before and after the MADB
policy changes. We will use interrupted time series approach to account for any secular trends and make robust
within state comparisons, and supplement it with a differences in difference approach to provide comparison
with control states that did not experience a policy change.
Our findings will provide evidence on the spillover effect of MADB generosity on children’s access to dental
care. This study will be the first to use administrative data to examine the spillover effect of changing MADB
generosity on children’s dental care use. The study aligns with the strategic priorities of NIDCR to understand
and work to reduce child oral health disparities."

10905987,"Abstract
 Darobactin A is a post-translationally modified peptide antibiotic recently isolated from photorhabdus
symbionts present in nematodes. The molecule contains a novel pattern of internal oxidative cross links that
result in its pre-organization as a beta sheet mimetic. The compound binds to the beta barrel protein BamA and
inhibits chaperone functions essential for folding of bacterial outer membrane proteins. Darobactin A is broadly
active against gram-negative pathogens in vitro and in animal models of infection.
 The dar operon encodes a single radical SAM enzyme that catalyzes formation of both oxidative cross links
observed in the natural product. The mechanism(s) behind this remarkable outcome is not yet known. We have
expressed and purified recombinant His-tagged DarE. When properly reconstituted with iron and sulfur under
anaerobic conditions, iron titration data indicates the enzyme contains three iron sulfur clusters and it rapidly
generates 5dAdo from SAM – indicating reconstituted DarE is active as a SPASM enzyme. Here we propose a
combined chemical synthesis and biosynthesis program to study DarE enzymology and to engineer semi-
synthetic forms of the natural product that can be produced on scale. Such studies hold considerable promise.
It has been nearly 60 years since a new class of antibiotics active against gram negative infections have been
developed."

Droughts are an important natural disaster but the health implications for elderly populations in the United
States have not been extensively studied. This study seeks to provide evidence on the cardiometabolic health
risks posed by drought. Droughts can contribute to groundwater over-pumping, and this may in turn lead to
arsenic release from aquifer clays into drinking water sources. The impacts of drought on arsenic exposure
and resultant health outcomes in human populations are potentially important and this study seeks to address
that knowledge gap. We propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study using data from the San Luis Valley
Diabetes Study, as well as hydrogeological measurements of water and environmental conditions in the San
Luis Valley, to clarify relationships between drought, arsenic in water, arsenic exposure (as measured by urine
biomarker), and cardiometabolic health outcomes including incident diabetes (DM), incident cardiovascular
disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality. This work is community-engaged and includes a K12 outreach
component. Aim 1 quantifies the relationship of drought to individual arsenic exposures and thence to incident
CVD, incident DM, and mortality. Aim 2 generates a model for groundwater arsenic as a function of
hydrological predictors using machine learning approaches, and uses this to explore relationships between
drought, modeled water arsenic and the outcomes of Aim 1. Aim 3 estimates the association between
cumulative arsenic exposure and incident CVD, incident DM, and mortality, using a nested case-control design
and predictions over time of arsenic exposure from the Aim 2 model. Aim 4 is a simulation study projecting
future CVD and DM outcomes under different scenarios of drought conditions, with and without counterfactual
interventions to reduce drinking water arsenic."
10865084,"Synucleinopathies such as Lewy body dementia (LBD) and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD), both Alzheimer’s disease-related disorders (ADRD), are some of the most common and fastest growing types of dementia in the world. In addition, synuclein pathology is increasingly appreciated as contributing to mixed pathology in dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease. Although synuclein-associated ADRDs are commonly thought of as causing tremor, slowness, and stiffness from degeneration of the motor structures of the nigrostriatal network, the accumulation of the protein alpha- synuclein fibrils is also seen in cognitive and affective brain networks, leading to dementia. Patients and their families struggle with a host of cognitive and affective symptoms, usually referred to as ‘non-motor symptoms”, with significant impact on their quality of life. By 2040 there will be close to 20 million patients world-wide with cognitive impairment, impulsivity, hallucinations, and anxiety, and other features of dementia just from synuclein-associated ADRDs alone, with few effective therapies for these non-motor symptoms. A common feature of all synuclein-related dementias is that age is the most significant risk factor. Despite the role of age as a risk factor, however, the specific interactions between age and a-synuclein in cognitive and network dysfunction remain largely unstudied and an important unmet need in understanding the mechanisms of age-dependent dementia and neurodegeneration. Moreover, synuclein animal models used to study pathophysiologic mechanisms of LBD and PDD are usually young adults, and rarely take age into account. Published and preliminary data show that experimental seeding of synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF) induces changes in oscillations in the cortex of young adult mice, that synuclein pathology affecting the mesocorticolimbic network can induce cognitive and affective deficits, and that mesocorticolimbic network function is also compromised in normal aging. Moreover, non-invasive, gamma-band neuromodulation improves cognition and delays progression of neuropathology in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. The establishment of aged rat models and PFF injections in our lab have particular value in assessing the cognitive and affective effects of the interaction between aging and synuclein pathology. Rats have a rich behavioral repertoire for assessment of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. The injection of preformed synuclein fibrils into the ventral tegmental area allows for the targeting of a rapidly progressive pathology at a given timepoint to a mesocorticolimbic structure known to show synuclein pathology, which is analogous to human LBD and PDD non-motor disease and progression. The objective of this proposal is to is to develop an experimental approach that recapitulates behavioral, pathological, and neural network signatures of cognitive and affective dysfunction in LBD and PDD, determine the interacting effects of advanced age and a-synuclein pathology on cognitive/motivational and neural network outcomes relevant for synuclein-related dementias, and test a neuromodulatory therapy for these non-motor symptoms based on gamma-band therapies efficacious in Alzheimer’s disease mouse models. Our rationale is that these experiments will help to establish the role of the mesocorticolimbic network in cognitive symptoms in age-related synucleinopathy, and identify a framework for therapeutic neuromodulation in future studies that addresses synuclein-associated dementias."
10873032,"Infectious diarrhea afflicts a billion people a year and is responsible for approximately 4% of all human
deaths worldwide. Salmonella enterica are common causes of infectious diarrhea in humans, and often
plague active military servicemen and veterans. Salmonella are among the most frequent bacterial
isolates resistant to antibiotics. The antibiotic resistance crisis is becoming a clinical problem of epic
proportions, as the number of therapeutic compounds in the pipeline is dwindling. Future prophylactic
and therapeutic approaches against drug resistant bacteria will greatly benefit from the identification of
molecular targets in pathogens. During the last 20 years only 4 novel compounds have been introduced
in the clinic, all of which represent new mechanisms identified through basic understanding of molecular
pathogenesis. As holds true for all human pathogens, precise regulation of RNA polymerase controls
essential aspects of Salmonella pathogenesis, and the expression of antibiotic resistant programs. Our
investigations have shown that allosteric interactions of DksA and Gre factors with RNA polymerase
regulate vital facets of Salmonella pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance. The proposed research will
elucidate the mechanisms by which the DnaK/DnaJ chaperone couple regulates interactions of DksA
with RNA polymerase, thereby engaging fundamental Salmonella virulence programs. We will also
characterize how binding of Gre factors to the secondary channel of RNA polymerase provides a
previously unsuspected level of regulation of Salmonella pathogenesis and antibiotic tolerance.
Specifically, we will test the role that the transcriptional proofreading associated with Gre factors plays in
resistance of Salmonella to the bactericidal activity inherent to the NADPH oxidase. Our investigations
will also characterize how Gre factors modulate the expression of a type III secretion system that is vital
to the intracellular lifestyle of Salmonella, while bolstering resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics that
poison bacterial translation. Our investigations will aid in the rational development of future therapies
against a variety of Gram-negative, antibiotic resistant bacteria that cause high rates of morbidity and
mortality in active servicemen, veterans and their families.

10873059,"Every day, 21 veterans complete suicide, primarily due to the ramifications of untreated depression. Due to
fear and stigma, many do not seek treatment. For those who do, about one third of the time, no drug offers
relief and even those antidepressants that do work often require 6-8 weeks before therapeutic onset.
Unfortunately, no unifying hypothesis for a molecular/cellular basis of action for antidepressant drugs (or
depressive disorders) has emerged. Over the last several years, we have suggested that, in addition to
presynaptic targets (uptake sites), a number of antidepressant drugs have a post-synaptic mechanism of
action. Toward this end, we have observed that chronic treatment (3-5 days) of cultured neural or glial cells
with a number of chemically diverse antidepressant compounds translocates the heterotrimeric G protein Gsα
out of lipid rafts and into a closer association with adenylyl cyclase, icreasing produciot of the intracelylar
messenger, cAMP. Post-mortem tissue from depressed suicides shows just the opposite, with an increased
proportion of Gsα ensconsed in lipid rafts and preliminary data suggest that this is also observed in blood cells,
where the extent of Gsα in lipid rafts correlates with both depression and clinical response to antidepressants.
Furthermore, several psychedelic or dissociative anesthetic compounds may have antidepressant effects as
well as shorter therapeutic onset, and the proposed studies will search for a cellular “biosignature” for
antidepressant action. Proposed studies will also attempt to establish a mechanistic understanding for the
translocation of Gsα from lipid rafts as a hallmark of depression and as a conduit for antidepressant action.
One intent of the proposed studies is to develop a platform that can provide a cell-based screen for putative
antidepressant compounds as well as a screening tool to indicate personalized antidepressant choice. Another
intent of these studies is to provide a peripheral tissue biological marker for depression and an early (< 1 week)
indicator of successful antidepressant treatment that can be developed into a clinically useful, inexpensive and
readily-available biomarker for clinical use. The identification of a pathway for antidepressant action might lead
to novel antidepressant drugs, while the assignation of a quantitative value for depression may help overcome
stigma and encourage thousands of depressed veterans to seek treatment."
10881710,"Much has been learned about the molecular pathology of melanoma in recent years and significant progress
has been made towards its treatment, yet late-stage melanoma still remains one of the least curable cancers
with high metastatic propensity. The brain is a common site of metastasis for patients with various neoplasia
including melanoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. The mainstay for treatment of brain
metastasis has been radiation therapy; sometimes surgery and chemotherapeutic agents have been included.
Most clinical trials usually excluded patients with brain metastases because of the unlikelihood these patients
will benefit from such regiment, however, recently a few trials have included melanoma patients with or without
brain metastases. Preliminary results from these trials are suggestive that similar responsiveness was observed
for patients with or without brain metastases, and further trials are needed to confirm these results. Despite these
improvements, patients with multiple brain metastases from solid tumors often show progression in the brain
contributing to neurological deterioration, decreased quality of life, and poor survival.
Mouse models reflecting human cancers are important tools towards the translation of basic science discoveries
to clinical therapies. However, rapidly evolving technologies within the last few years require further refining
current approaches that enable models to be more suitable in robust translational applications to provide
consistent information to meet patients’ needs. In our studies of melanoma, we discovered that >65% of human
melanoma cell lines and melanoma biopsies express metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1), independent
of N-RAS/B-RAF genotypes, while normal human melanocytes do not. Based on this discovery, our group was
the first to propose the link between GRM1-mediated glutamatergic signaling and melanoma. In recent clinical
trials, we observed that >90% of all enrolled patients expressed GRM1 within their late-stage melanomas.
However, the conventional mouse models of melanoma do not mimic this genetic alteration common to
melanoma patients. Therefore, we developed mouse models (MASS and TGS) where the ectopic expression of
GRM1 in previously normal melanocytes leads to consistent, wide-spread development of melanocytic lesions
and metastasis to various organs including the lung and brain, two common metastatic sites for human
melanoma. In this application, we propose to characterize the ability of these two different but complementary
innovative models that mimic human melanoma with brain metastases and fill the gap, to expand, improve, and
transform the utility of mammalian tumor models for translational research. Completion of this proposed work is
an essential step towards establishing fundamentally important and relevant animal models of human cancer
that will improve and save cancer patient lives."
10843798,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Malaria cases and deaths primarily caused by Plasmodium falciparum have declined significantly in sub-
Saharan Africa as a result of the broad deployment of vector control and effective clinical management. In low
to moderate-transmission settings slated for elimination, imported cases become an increasingly important
epidemiological consideration. In these settings, imported cases may a) represent a high but poorly defined
proportion of the overall malaria burden, b) result in secondary transmission that can impede local elimination
efforts, and c) may require additional or alternative interventions than standard control measures. Imported
cases, when currently evaluated at all, are operationally defined as infections acquired outside of a defined
geographic area and identified based on travel history. However, lack of capture of asymptomatic infections
together with variable quality of travel history collection limit the utility of this standard approach to identifying
imported infections and quantifying their role in transmission. Further, there are no routinely collected data that
would allow evaluation of the impact of imported cases on local transmission. In this proposal, we will collect
detailed travel histories, perform active surveillance for asymptomatic infections, and generate parasite
genomic data to more accurately define the role of imported infections in two representative border regions of
sub-Saharan Africa (Tororo District, Uganda and Mutasa District, Zimbabwe) that leverage substantial
surveillance infrastructure from the NIH-funded International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research
(ICEMR) network and will employ active (via a longitudinal study) and passive (via health facility surveillance)
designs to capture asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. We propose the following Specific Aims.1) To
quantify and characterize imported malaria infections. We will use a probabilistic approach to classify infections
as imported or local via detailed travel and other behavioral survey data and determine the travel patterns and
risk factors associated with importation. 2) To determine the impact of importation on local transmission and
identify appropriate targeted interventions. We will use parasite genomics and epidemiological data to define
local transmission and the impact of imported infections, taking advantage of dense sampling of symptomatic
and asymptomatic infections in focused geographies. We will use a robust set of statistical modeling
approaches, including Bayesian estimation of transmission networks incorporating all genomic and
epidemiologic data. We will use these data to model the predicted impact of various combinations of targeted
interventions. The expected outcome of the proposed research is evidence on appropriate surveillance
methods for imported malaria infections and on the contribution of these infections to sustaining transmission.
By identifying ways to better target interventions, these results will impact national and international malaria
control efforts as they strive for elimination and require evidence on how to mitigate the risk of imported malaria
infections."
10846715,"Electrostimulation (ES) is a versatile and efficient tool for interrogating, altering, and manipulating neural
activities in health and disease. Deep brain ES delivered with implanted electrodes requires an elaborate
neurosurgery and carries risks of tissue damage, bleeding, stroke, infection, and inflammation. This limits the
use of deep brain ES for disease diagnostics and conditions that may not justify the risks.
 Non-invasive targeted deep brain ES has long been a major quest, with countless potential applications.
The challenge is avoiding stimulation near surface electrodes, where the electric field is the strongest, while
stimulating at a depth by a (much) weaker electric field. One way to stimulate at a distance is by temporal
interference (TI) of two high-frequency sine waves delivered with a small frequency shift. The interference of
two such waves creates an amplitude-modulated stimulus at the target. Assumed demodulation of this signal
by neurons leads to their excitation at the modulation frequency.
 Here, we introduce an entirely different concept of the temporal interference, based on (a) complete
cancellation of identical frequency carrier signals at the target, and (b) on the introduction of transient
distortions in one or both these signals. The distortions, such as a brief frequency or phase shift, will be
concealed by the strong periodic signal near the stimulating electrodes and will not lead to excitation at the
surface. However, these distortions will add up at the remote target location. They will stand out from the
“silent” background and will readily lead to excitation despite the attenuation of the electric field with distance.
We will perform mechanistic studies which support this next generation TI (NG-TI) stimulation paradigm. We
will continue with the design and experimental evaluation of different NG-TI protocols in vitro, in comparison
with the “standard” TI. We will systematically analyze the impact of TI stimulation parameters, to achieve
targeted tuning and modulation of individual neurons and neuronal circuitry. We hypothesize that NG-TI can be
improved for more focal stimulation, with much better penetration. It will have lower electric charge stimulation
threshold and enable better steerability than the standard TI. The most efficient NG-TI protocols will further be
validated by in vivo animal experiments. We will qualitatively compare targeting, possible off-site effects,
current consumption, and steerability of NG-TI and the standard TI. We will also define the feasibility and
model the electric field parameters for NG-TI stimulation at distances useful for medical applications. The
effects will be linked to dielectric and physiological properties of neurons and neural tissue, to build predictive
models for non-invasive deep brain stimulation in large animal and human trials. This project will lay the ground
to translate the NG-TI technology for disease diagnosis and treatment."
10883683,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Detection of cancer biomarkers in the blood, known as “liquid biopsy”, can in principle improve
the accuracy of measuring nearly invisible “minimal residual disease (MRD)”. Exosomes are cell-
excreted extracellular vesicles that contain surface proteins and genetic materials (DNA and RNA)
that reflect the characteristics and make-up of the parental cell. Analyzing exosomes would
therefore provide direct insight into the state of the cancerous cell. For cancer diagnostics in
particular, recent evidences have shown that several micro-RNAs are differentially expressed in
CTE. Therefore, unlocking the wealth of information in CTE can potentially cause a paradigm
shift. However, current barriers for profiling CTE are the following: (1) all existing technologies
require blood withdrawal; (2) involve sophisticated protocols; (3) label-free sizing/counting lacks
molecular specificity; (4) provide highly averaged results with high background from normal
exosomes, thus leading to poor sensitivity. (5) provide “partial” information: either surface antigen
or cargo DNA/RNA, but not both. All of the above has led to a simplistic binary outcome that lacks
dynamic range and cannot be used frequently with high sensitivity. We propose a multi-pronged
solution on a microfluidic arrayed nanoplasmonic sensor & actuator (MANSA) platform for: (1)
streamlined isolation, concentration, and profiling. (2) improve sensitivity by monitoring
individual unlabeled exosome binding events with dynamic imaging technology complemented by
spectroscopic imaging. (3) improve specificity by profiling both surface antigen and internal
D/RNA biomarkers at single exosome level. (4) eliminate blood withdrawal using an integrated
needle device. (5) benchmark performance with various sample complexity from cancer cell line
extracts to cancer patient blood samples. Our goal is to obtain a high-resolution, digital exosome
map with both multiplex surface protein and cargo D/RNA biomarker profiles to facilitate high
dynamic range enumeration and boost sensitivity. The proposed technology will become a cost-
effective, point-of-care-friendly, translational platform that will address a critical need in early
cancer and MRD detection to improve cancer healthcare outcomes. The technology can also be
broadly applied to exosome-based diagnostics of non-cancer diseases and basic biomedical
research."
