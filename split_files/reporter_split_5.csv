10757601,"The Problem: Differences in (or Disorders of) Sex Development (DSD) are complex medical issues that
involve multiple interacting cell types and organ systems. DSDs impact disease susceptibility, psychological
development, and sense of person. Knowledge of mechanisms by which genetic factors interact with each
other and with the environment to direct sex determination (SD), however, is incomplete. Zebrafish is an
important medical model with a SD system that is sensitive to unidentified genetic variation and poorly
understood environmental influences. Our research showed that zebrafish lab strains have weak,
polymorphic, or non-genetic SD mechanisms, but natural zebrafish from India have a single, strong Sex-
Associated Region on chromosome-4 (sar4) with chromosomally ZZ males and ZW females. ZZ fish are
always males and most ZW fish are females, but a minority are fertile `neomales', likely due to genetic
modifiers or environmental factors. Rare WW fish can be either males or females. We and others have
made mutations in many candidate SD genes, but none represent the sar4 SD factor. We also showed that
meiotic oocytes are necessary in lab strains to maintain female development, presumably by sending a
signal to the gonadal soma. Our overall goals are to identify the molecular genetic basis of the sar4 sex
determinant, and to discover its molecular, cellular, and organ level mechanisms to direct male or female
development. Under one hypothesis, sar4-W has a dominant, variably penetrant, female-determining gene.
An alternative hypothesis invokes sar4-Z dosage, with two doses resulting in a male and one dose or no
doses usually giving females. In either case, we want to know how it specifies sex. In preliminary results,
we: 1) collected four independently derived strains with the natural sar4 SD mechanism; 2) made genome
assemblies for several natural strains; 3) developed PCR primers to assay sar4-Z and sar4-W; 4) made
Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs) for ZZ and for ZW fish and isolated many sar4 BACs; and 5)
performed single-cell RNA-seq on ZZ and ZW genotypes, which identified ZZ- and ZW-specific cell clusters.
A comparison of sar4-Z to sar4-W identified a large recombination-suppressing inversion, many indels, and
other polymorphisms. The overall vision of the research program is to manipulate genomes and
environments to uncover the mysteries of zebrafish SD. Work includes: 1) identifying SD factor(s) in sar4 by
performing necessity experiments that examine the effects of CRISPR/Cas9-induced long deletions and
targeted knockouts on SD and sufficiency experiments using BAC transgenesis to identify clones that alter
SD; and 2) to learn the pathways of male and female SD in zebrafish by single-cell gene expression studies
in a variety of developmental stages, mutant genotypes, and environmental manipulations in ZZ and ZW
fish. The significance will be a better understanding of gene interactions and environmental influences on
zebrafish sex determination that will inform human DSDs."
10755607,"Background: Effective evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy, have competency-
based trainings in place and are mandated to be available to Veterans with PTSD in the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA). Despite their effectiveness, at least a third of Veterans will prematurely drop out
of PTSD EBPs, which is associated with poorer clinical outcomes and greater healthcare utilization.
Delivery of PTSD EBPs in a massed format of three or more sessions weekly have demonstrated promise
for increasing treatment retention. It is hypothesized that massed EBPs will be feasible.
Significance/Impact: The current proposal is highly significant: 1) PTSD EBP retention remains low, 2)
prior research aimed to improve retention in PTSD EBPs has yielded only modest improvements, 3)
research on massed treatments for PTSD outside of VHA suggest improved retention, but is limited by
observational design and lack of comparison groups, and 4) PTSD is a high priority HSR&D domain.
Innovation: This CDA-2 application is innovative: 1) it adapts PTSD EBP delivery by increasing the
frequency of delivery, 2) the proposed feasibility randomized clinical trial (RCT) will inform a subsequent
IIR to conduct the first RCT of massed PTSD EBPs in VHA, 3) the first study to examine multiple
stakeholders' preferences, and perceived barriers and facilitators of massed PTSD EBPs, and 4) massed
PTSD EBPs may improve PTSD treatment engagement and improve clinical outcomes.
Specific Aims: Aim 1. Qualitatively explore through semi-structured interviews with stakeholders'
(Veterans [n=16], providers [n=12], and administrators [n=12]) perceived barriers and facilitators to
implementation, and preferences for massed PTSD treatment delivery within VHA PTSD specialty clinics
to inform the development of the massed PTSD treatment program to be piloted in Aim 2.
Aim 2a. Conduct a pilot pragmatic randomized clinical trial (RCT; n=30) to examine the feasibility and
acceptability of massed EBP PTSD treatments (EBP-massed) compared to PTSD EBPs as they are typically
delivered (EBP-TAU) in a VA PTSD Specialty Clinic. In addition, we will gather preliminary data on
satisfaction, completion rates, session attendance, and PTSD, depression, and functioning outcomes.
Aim 2b. Conduct a summative evaluation via qualitative interviews with all Veterans in the pilot trial
(n=30) and with providers (n=4) who delivered massed treatment to contextualize the quantitative
findings and further refine massed PTSD treatments for a future IIR.
Aim 3a. Characterize a national cohort of Veterans who begin 1) massed PTSD EBPs and 2) PTSD EBPs
TAU.
Aim 3b. Among Veterans who initiated treatment, compare treatment completion (i.e., 8 sessions) rates
between those who received massed EBPs and those who received EBP-TAU.
Next Steps/Implementation: In Aim 1, we will conduct semi-structured qualitative interviews with
Veterans (n=16), providers (n=12), and administrators (n=12). Social Cognitive Theory and the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research will inform these interviews and results will
inform our pilot trial in Aim 2a. In Aim 2a, we will conduct a feasibility RCT to compare massed PTSD
EBPs to PTSD EBPs delivered as usual in a VA PTSD Specialty Clinic. In Aim 2b, we will utilize semi-
structured qualitative interviews with Veterans and providers in the pilot trial to evaluate satisfaction
and identify additional modifications to the massed treatment program. Aim 3a and 3b will utilize the
VA's CDW."
10791749,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Late talking is associated with negative academic and socio-emotional outcomes. Despite this, behavioral
measures are relatively poor at predicting who will end up having developmental language disorder. Moreover,
not much is known about either the typical neurocognitive changes associated with language development or
the brain basis of delayed language during preschool, as there have been only three retrospective studies. This
project uses well-controlled functional neuroimaging paradigms tapping into receptive language skills and
structural imaging of white matter connectivity, as well as an extensive behavioral battery that measures well-
established deficits in phonology, semantics and morphology. Four-year-olds, oversampled for late talking, are
longitudinally followed when they are 6- and 8-years-old. The first aim determines the sensitivity of the dorsal
and ventral pathways to phonological and semantic skills, respectively, motivated by the predictions of the Dual
Stream Theory. The second and third aim determine the strength of the directional effects of these pathways on
each other, and whether these effects differ depending on age. The fourth aim determines the effect of these
pathways on the behavioral development of morphology. Our finding that phonological processing drives the
development of semantic and morphological processing would be consistent with Phonological Theory, that
semantic processing drives the acquisition of phonological and morphological processing would be consistent
with Semantic Theory, or that there are interactive effects would be consistent with Bidirectional Theory. Using
a state-of-the-art analytical approach justified by tailored power analyses, we expect to find evidence supporting
a model in which early phonological processing drives semantic change and later semantic processing drives
morphological change. Although we have theoretically motivated planned comparisons, exploratory analyses
will also be conducted to support future work. The scientific rigor of the project is supported by our extensive
published research examining phonological and semantic specialization of the brain in kindergarteners into
elementary school. The feasibility of the project is supported by our encouraging pilot behavioral and
neuroimaging data in 4-year-olds on the exact paradigms to be used in this project. Although we take a
dimensional approach to test our model, as research shows that language ability is on a continuum, we also
perform exploratory categorical analyses comparing late talkers to typical children. Research is inconclusive with
regards to the role of screening of language delay to inform decisions of early intervention. We hope that a more
basic mechanistic understanding of the dynamics of language development will allow for the formulation of
predictive biomarkers to be used in screening for intervention. We are committed to open science, and plan to
pre-register our work, and share our analytical code and data."
10754527,"Project Abstract
The overall theme of my research program is to understand the formation mechanism of chromatin structure and
its role in gene regulation. We plan to address this problem at two different levels: 1) at the chromatin /
nucleosome level, we will identify pioneer factors (PFs) and investigate the mechanism underlying nucleosome
displacement and chromatin opening, and 2) at the chromosome level, we will study the mechanism of gene
regulation by high-order 3D chromosome organization. In the past five years, supported by two NIGMS R01
grants, we have made significant progress in both directions. New observations and insights we gained from
these studies, as well as several novel methods we developed, form the foundation of this proposal.
Theme1: Pioneer factors (PFs) can invade nucleosome and increase chromatin accessibility near their binding
sites and therefore play critical roles in gene regulation. Mis-regulation of PFs is highly linked to cancer and
developmental disease. Despite their essential functions, only a handful of PFs have been identified and the
mechanism underlying the pioneer activity is unclear. The long term goal of this theme is to systematically
characterize PFs and their pioneer activities in health and disease cells, and to develop a full understanding of
the mechanism of these activities. In our recent PF studies, we have innovated an Integrated Synthetic Oligo
(ISO) assay to investigate PF function in a high-throughput manner. In the next five years, we plan to 1) adapt
the ISO assay into human cell lines and pluripotent stem cells to dissect the genetic rules underlying PF binding
and nucleosome displacement, and 2) further our understanding of the pioneering activity by investigating the
co-factors of PFs, the sequence of events during nucleosome displacement, and the kinetic rates of these events.
Theme2: Imaging and 3C-based methods have revealed 3D chromosome organization with extensive long-
distance chromosomal interactions. The long-term goal of this theme is to understand the formation mechanism
of these high-order chromosome structures and their roles in gene regulation. Our recent studies show that long-
distance chromosomal interactions contribute to gene regulation in yeast. More specifically, some allelic or co-
regulated genes cluster in the 3D space, and such clustering is correlated with higher gene activities. The former
case is analogous to the “transvection” phenomenon in Drosophila. These novel observations revealed a new
layer of gene regulation in yeast and opened the opportunity of using the powerful genetic system to investigate
the 3D genome function. Currently we have little understanding of what mediates the cluster formation and how
the clusters enhance gene expression. In the next five years, we plan to 1) use an unbiased genetic screen to
identify factors that negatively regulate transvection, and investigate the underlying mechanism, and 2) test the
hypothesis that some activators condense though liquid-liquid phase separation, leading to the clustering of co-
regulated genes and enhanced expression."

Therapeutic potential of base editing strategies to convert CAG to CAA in Huntington's disease
Huntington's disease (HD) defies development of effective treatments despite its long-known genetic cause
and numerous mechanisms implicated in model systems, reflecting limited clinical utility of model-based
investigations. By contrast, observations in HD patients may reveal therapeutics that actually works in people.
All cases of HD are due to an expanded CAG repeat in huntingtin gene. However, age at clinical manifestation
varies widely, and unexplained variance in age at onset by the mutation size shows heritability, indicating HD is
modified by genes. Therefore, we performed genome-wide association study, and discovered that repeat
instability-related DNA repair genes modify HD onset. Importantly, we revealed that duplicated and loss of
CAG-CAA interruption in the huntingtin CAG repeat robustly delay and hasten HD onset age, respectively.
Together, our data indicate that the rate of HD is largely determined by the size of uninterrupted CAG repeat
and modified by repeat instability, providing insights into driver of the disease and therapeutic strategies.
Capitalizing on these clinically relevant observations in humans, we conceived novel therapeutic Base Editing
(BE) strategies to convert CAG to CAA aiming at delaying clinical manifestation by decreasing the size of
uninterrupted CAG repeat and potentially further suppressing repeat expansion. Our novel therapeutic BE
strategies have a number of advantages over other gene targeting approaches. Observations in patients
suggest that CAG-to-CAA conversion produces very strong therapeutic benefit (i.e., delaying onset more than
10 years). In addition, our BE strategies, targeting the root cause of the disease, do not alter huntingtin protein
since both CAG and CAA encode glutamine. Therefore, same single treatment strategies can be applied to all
HD patients to produce allele-specific benefits. Here, we propose to determine therapeutic potential of selected
BE strategies to convert CAG to CAA using relevant cell and animal models of HD. Briefly, we will 1) evaluate
conversion efficiencies and allele specificity of BE strategies with high efficiencies, 2) test whether CAG-to-
CAA conversion affects HTT expression levels, neuronal differentiation, and other molecular phenotypes, 3)
determine impacts of CAG-to-CAA conversion on CAG repeat instability, and 4) evaluate off-target effects, and
further optimize to reveal the BE strategy with the highest feasibility and therapeutic potential. This research
will 1) produce a complete evaluation chart for combinations of different base editors and conversion
strategies, 2) generate knowledge regarding allele specificity, off-targeting, and molecular consequences, 3)
provides considerations for subsequent optimization, and 4) produce expected outcomes when BE strategies
are applied to HD patients. Our research testing novel and innovative therapeutic routes for HD therefore will
significantly contribute to the development of effective therapeutics for HD and other CAG expansion disorders."
10755320,"Molecularly targeted cancer therapies, such as Abl-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have
converting many terminal cancers, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), into chronic diseases.
Despite the targeted approach, vascular toxicities have emerged. Specifically, the first-generation CML
TKI imatinib is safe, yet newer generation TKIs frequently used for resistant CML (nilotinib, dasatinib,
ponatinib) confer a 2-5 fold increased risk of arterial thrombosis causing MI, stroke, or limb ischemia.
With no validated models to test for vascular toxicity prior to drug approval, this side effect was identified
only when adverse events accrued and once recognized, there are no data to guide clinicians as to how
to prevent this or to treat these cancer survivors. This proposal addresses these gaps in knowledge by
leveraging the CML TKIs, a drug class with both safe and toxic members. We and others showed that
toxic CML TKIs damage ECs in some in vitro models and enhance atherosclerosis in mice. As CML
patients with underlying CV risk factors are predisposed to toxicity, we hypothesize that the toxic CML
drugs impair specific endothelial cell (EC) functions that lead to plaque development, inflammation,
rupture, thrombosis and ischemia. As these drugs are kinase inhibitors, we further posit that the toxicity
is caused by modulation of the phosphorylation state of signaling proteins in a manner that is deleterious
to EC function and have shown this using proteomic approaches. Thus, we now propose to test the
hypothesis that toxic CML TKIs act on ECs to impair barrier integrity, enhance leukocyte trafficking, slow
wound healing, and increase interaction with platelets, thereby promoting an atherosclerosis phenotype
prone to rupture and thrombosis, and that the drug-induced EC proteomic profile can predict vascular
toxicity and identify mitigating treatments. We test this with 2 aims using multiple innovative approaches:
SA1 interrogates the impact of each CML TKI using human engineered microvessels (hEMVs) to
examine the impact on vascular permeability and platelet aggregation and in mice using intravital
microscopy to quantify leukocyte-EC interaction, carotid wire injury to measure vascular re-
endothelialization, and Apo-E-KO mice with FACS to quantify vascular inflammation in atherosclerosis.
SA2 uses a targeted mass spectrometry based phosphoproteomic assay to profile the effects of emerging
CML TKIs and a broad range of drugs approved for CV disease in human ECs to determine if this can
predict toxicity of new TKIs and identify mitigating therapies. Predicted toxicities and “antidotes” that
oppose the toxic proteomic signature will be tested using the in vitro and in vivo models described in SA1.
Completion of the aims will transform cardiooncology by validating preclinical models to predict vascular
safety of CML TKIs and identify potential treatments for vascular toxicity that can be rapidly translated to
cardiooncology care."

Decades of work have established a paradigm for hematopoietic regeneration and maintenance based on the
activity of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at its apex. Our understanding of the fundamental
properties of HSCs and progenitor populations has been historically based on notions derived from
transplantation assays. Data over the last few years, however, have challenged the most fundamental aspects
of models based on these studies, and have raised biological questions that are of direct clinical relevance in
the hematology field. Additionally, it is now clear that intrinsic heterogeneity exists among seemingly pure
populations of HSCs and downstream progenitors. How the functionally distinct behavior of these
stem/progenitor cells is molecularly regulated and how individual clone size is controlled over time represent
important biological questions relevant to our understanding of normal and diseased hematopoiesis. Over the
past five years, my lab has developed novel single cell-based lineage tracing systems to study hematopoietic
biology in the non-transplanted individual, which we refer to as native hematopoiesis. With these tools, we
have shown that important biological differences exist between the source of hematopoietic cells and their
outcomes when comparing transplantation versus native blood physiology. More recently, we have coupled
lineage output readouts with molecular measurements at the single cell level, allowing us to identify
transcriptional features of stem/progenitor cells that carry distinct functional outcomes. In this renewal
application, we aim to utilize these high-resolution lineage-tracing tools to further characterize drivers of
functional HSC heterogeneity and aging in native hematopoiesis. First, we will functionally and
molecularly characterize a novel transcriptional regulator of the native HSC state, which we have identified
using our singe cell screens. Second, we will utilize a combination of single cell lineage tracing,
transcriptomics, and epigenomics to understand the molecular changes and clonal fluctuations that occur
during the aging process in the mouse. Third, we will adapt our single cell molecular tracing strategies to
characterize human hematopoiesis in a surrogate native state, and to identify potential novel regulators of
human HSC behavior. Our comprehensive and interdisciplinary studies will shed led on the cellular and
molecular mechanisms driving hematopoiesis in situ. Moreover, these studies will inform efforts to enhance
hematopoietic regeneration and prevent pre-malignant clonal hematopoiesis."
10794935,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder afflicting 6 million Americans. The
clinical dementia of AD is coupled to a distinct pathology, with β-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and
synaptic loss. Synapses are essential for cognitive function, and their loss is well established as the major
structural correlate of cognitive impairment in AD. An early event in AD pathogenesis, synaptic failure is
detectable in individuals with the prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is increasingly employed in the study of AD. However, until
recently there have been no PET radiotracers that can directly image synaptic density in vivo, which would be
of high value in AD diagnosis, as well as in monitoring efficacy of treatments. We have developed 11C-UCB-J
as a radiotracer for PET imaging and quantification of the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein-2A (SV2A). In studies
in healthy human subjects, 11C-UCB-J displayed excellent properties for quantitative PET imaging of SV2A in
the human brain. We have also validated SV2A as an in vivo biomarker for synaptic density. Initial imaging
results in MCI/AD patients show specific and distinct SV2A reductions, most pronounced (30-40%) in the
hippocampus, which is expected and consistent with postmortem studies, where early degeneration of the
entorhinal cortical cell projection to hippocampus and hippocampal SV2A reductions have been observed.
Thus, based on these data, 11C-UCB-J appears to be an excellent radiotracer for quantitative imaging of SV2A
in the human brain and 11C-UCB-J PET can be an extremely useful in vivo biomarker of synaptic loss in AD.
 Although 11C-UCB-J proves to be an excellent tracer for synaptic density imaging, a significant drawback is
the short half-life (t1/2 = 20.4 min) of its 11C-radiolabel, which precludes its central production and distribution to
multiple sites for imaging use, and thus limits its wide application in multi-center clinical trials or as diagnostic
agent in clinics. For AD in particular, where drug clinical trials at many institutions are ongoing, the need for a
longer-lived radiotracer is evident and one labeled with the 18F-radioisotope (t1/2 = 109.8 min) will be
appropriate. Analogous to the development of 11C-PIB and its FDA-approved 18F-labeled counterpart 18F-
flutemetamol (Vizamyl®) for β-amyloid imaging in AD, in this application we propose to develop18F-SDM-8, the
difluorinated analog of UCB-J, for human neuroimaging, and to validate its use as a imaging biomarker of
synaptic loss in MCI/AD. The goal is to provide a “neuroimaging biomarker of synaptic density” for use in
the study of the AD continuum and potential diagnosis of AD in its earliest, prodromal stage, as well as in the
monitoring of disease progression and efficacy of emerging AD therapies. In addition to AD, the availability of
18F-SDM-8 PET as a general imaging biomarker of synaptic density will enable the investigation of a wide
range of neuropsychiatric diseases where abnormalities in synaptic density/plasticity are implicated."
10756994,"Circadian (daily) rhythms are a crucial component of human health that regulates sleep, alertness,
hormones, metabolism, and many other biological processes. The ultimate explanation for the mechanism
of circadian oscillators will require characterizing the structures, functions, and interactions of the
molecular components of these clocks. The current project is to elucidate the basic principles of circadian
clocks at a biophysical/molecular level in the cyanobacterial model system, where genetic/biochemical
studies have identified three key clock proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, that can reconstitute a circadian
oscillator in vitro. This remarkable demonstration has led to a re-evaluation of our understanding of
circadian clocks in all organisms, including mammals. Moreover, atomic resolution structures of KaiA,
KaiB, and KaiC proteins have been determined that enable truly molecular analyses of clock mechanisms.
This research project will focus on answering two fundamental questions in chronobiology: ""how do
circadian enzymes work?"" and ""what is the adaptive advantage of circadian mechanisms?"" Regarding the
first question of enzymatic mechanism, we will determine the basis of the central property of ""temperature
compensation"" of the core clockwork by biochemical/biophysical, genetic, and structural approaches.
Temperature-compensation mutations of the Kai proteins will be studied to generate specific hypotheses
that will be tested by novel in vitro biochemical analyses (e.g., single-molecule dynamics) and targeted
mutations. The biochemical data that result from the analyses of these mutants will be used to generate
models that account for the temperature compensated, 24 h time constant of the circadian oscillator.
Regarding the second overall question of adaptive advantage, differential expression of circadian rhythms
under some conditions but not others is based on novel mechanisms of codon usage, and the mechanism
of this adaptive phenomenon will be analyzed, as well as recruited to maximize cost-effective synthesis of
bioproducts. Finally, a novel hypothesis with far-reaching implications will be evaluated, namely that
accurate circadian timekeeping requires compensation for metabolic perturbations, of which temperature
change is only one among many such perturbations.
The answers to these questions will lead to wide-ranging general insights into the mechanisms and
applications of biological timekeeping."
10757004,"ABSTRACT
 Fibrosis, defined by the deposition of collagen I, is a devastating pathological event that occurs in many
organs including the heart, kidney, liver and lung in response to injury and inflammation. This fibrotic response
inhibits recovery inflammation and can even lead to organ failure. Despite the potential importance, very little is
known about whether there is a fibrotic response in the central nervous system (CNS) following
neuroinflammation that occurs in diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, stroke and CNS
infections, and how this response affects repair and recovery. Using experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of neuroinflammation, we have identified that a robust collagen I-
based fibrotic scar forms covering the neuroinflammatory lesion and we hypothesize that this fibrotic scar
inhibits the ability of reparative cells to enter the lesion. In preliminary studies using lineage tracing and single
cell sequencing, we have identified that this fibrotic scar is formed by the activation and proliferation of
fibroblasts. We have further generated methods to isolate and culture CNS fibroblasts providing an in vitro
model to study the proliferation, migration and collagen 1 production from these cells. In this proposal we aim
to determine whether the fibrotic scar is helpful or harmful for recovery following neuroinflammation and to
further study the mechanisms that regulate fibrotic scar formation. We will first determine whether inhibition of
fibrotic scar formation can lead to an increased recovery from EAE. We will then examine whether TGFβ and
PDGFR signaling pathways regulate fibrotic scar formation. We hypothesize that TGFβ signaling drives the
proliferation and collagen I production by the fibroblasts and that PDGFR signaling regulates the migration of
the fibroblasts to the lesion. Our goal is to determine whether modulating the fibrotic scar is a potential
therapeutic target to aid in recovery for patients with neuroinflammatory diseases."
10728882,"Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is an important concern of the Veterans Administration that affects
many veterans who served in combat in Afghanistan and Iraq and is frequently associated with
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). When these conditions occur together they are associated with
considerable morbidity, increased healthcare costs and loss of economic productivity. Current treatments
for mTBI and PTSD have limitations, and in many veterans these become lifelong disorders. Electrical
treatments represent a new horizon in the approach to disorders related to neurotrauma. One type of
treatment is Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS), which shows promise for neurotrauma in that it promotes
neuroplasticity, enhances new learning, and blocks stress physiology both through effects on brain
regions involved in modulation of stress as well reduction of peripheral sympathetic and inflammatory and
enhancement of parasympathetic function. This is mediated through afferent and efferent branches of the
vagus nerve that project to both the brain and peripheral inflammatory and autonomic systems. Earlier
generations of VNS were limited by the need for complicated surgical and anesthetic procedures, high
cost, and lack of reimbursement by insurance for procedures or routine healthcare follow-up. This
prevented wide-spread implementation of these treatments. New non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation
(nVNS) devices are more economical and do not require surgical implantation. Our preliminary data
shows that nVNS (but not sham stimulation) blocks effects of stress on peripheral vasoconstriction and
increased sympathetic tone as measured with direct cardiovascular measures (pre-ejection period, or
PEP), reduces inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, or IL-6), enhances anterior cingulate function, blocks
insula response to stress, promotes memory and reduces PTSD symptoms. This project will explore the
effects of nVNS or sham treatment on brain, cardiovascular / sympathetic and immune response to stress
in combat veterans with mTBI and PTSD. Subjects will undergo exposure to stress in conjunction with
High Resolution Positron Emission Tomography (HR-PET) and radiolabeled water measurement of brain
blood flow, and peripheral cardiovascular /sympathetic function and immune biomarkers in blood. We
hypothesize that nVNS but not sham stimulation will result in an increase in anterior cingulate and
reduced insula function with stress tasks and hippocampal function with memory tasks, and block
cardiovascular / sympathetic and immune response to stress in patients with mTBI and PTSD.
Furthermore we hypothesize that daily nVNS (but not sham) for three months will lead to an enhancement
in memory function, reduction in PTSD symptoms, and modulate brain and autonomic responses to
stress. This project will provide information about mechanisms of nVNS on the neurobiology and
physiology of mTBI with comorbid PTSD and ways in which it may ameliorate symptoms and enhance
cognition. This may be a promising future approach for rehabilitation of veterans with neurotrauma."
10837640,"This application aims to create innovative polymer coatings to improve intracortical
microelectrode biocompatibility. Following intracortical microelectrode implantation, an inflammatory response
leads to neuronal loss and the formation of a glial scar around the implant. The loss of neurons and the
formation of the glial scar lead to diminished recordings of nearby neurons over time. Biomaterial coatings
have the potential of mitigating the inflammatory and glial scarring response. However, drug release from these
biomaterials occurs over short durations (hours/days) and many drug-releasing material coatings are
mechanically stiff. We seek to increase the duration of release while reducing the mechanical stiffness of
coatings to improve intracortical microelectrode biocompatibility.
Over the past several years, our groups have created high molecular weight poly(pro-drug) polymer coatings
fabricated from curcumin. Thin films or coatings enable long-lasting release of curcumin (several weeks to
months of release), and the coatings are significantly less stiff than microelectrode materials. In pilot studies,
poly(pro-curcumin) polymer coatings greatly reduce the lesion size following intracortical implantation,
demonstrating the potential promise of our approach. Our guiding hypothesis is that the creation of poly(pro-
drug) polymer coatings from curcumin increase neuroprotection to improve the long-term recording capability
of electrodes.
This project is likely to make significant contributions by developing new biomaterial coatings capable of
releasing drug over longer durations. These new poly(pro-drug) polymers could potentially lead to paradigm
shifts in both biomaterials and neuroscience research for the treatment of injury following central nervous
system injury. More specifically, this project would impact the field of neural recording by enabling longer-term
recording, potentially enhancing neuroprosthetic interfaces for Veterans suffering from central nervous system
related paralysis."
10754509,"Project Summary/Abstract
Controlling the movement of electrons and protons is critical for a wide range of biological processes, including
cellular respiration, DNA biosynthesis, and photoreception used for optogenetics. Many of these processes are
driven by the formation of tyrosine or tryptophan radical species via proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). An
elementary PCET reaction involves the transfer of one electron and one proton, but more complex PCET
processes involve the transfer of multiple electrons and protons. The Hammes-Schiffer group has developed a
general PCET theory enabling the calculation of rate constants and has applied this theory to biomimetic model
systems and to elementary PCET in an enzyme. Simulating more complex biological PCET processes is
challenging because of the significance of hydrogen tunneling and conformational motions, as well as key
contributions from multiple time and length scales. A major goal of this proposal is to develop a multiscale
modeling approach that describes the individual PCET steps, including the electronic and nuclear quantum
effects, as well as the key conformational changes coupled to them. Quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics
methods will be used to compute the input quantities to the PCET theory. The calculated rate constants for
individual PCET reactions and protein conformational changes will serve as input into microkinetic models to
enable the complete description of complex multi-electron, multi-proton biological processes. This multiscale
modeling approach will be closely connected to experimental data, relying on atomic-level structures and
thermodynamic and kinetic measurements. Initially this approach will be applied to PCET in the well-defined,
controlled protein environment of the α3X proteins, which consist of three alpha helices with a single interior
tyrosine or tryptophan that can be oxidized electrochemically. This approach will be expanded to explore multi-
electron, multi-proton reactions in the more complex protein environment of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR).
This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of nucleotides to deoxynucleotides, thereby maintaining the nucleotide
pool balance required for effective DNA synthesis, replication, and repair. In addition to its biochemical
importance, RNR serves as a prototype for multi-step biological PCET. The long-range radical translocation over
~35 Å in RNR is proposed to occur via a series of PCET steps involving tyrosine and tryptophan residues, as
well as significant conformational changes. A recently solved cryo-EM structure of the active complex resolves
the entire PCET pathway and provides an opportunity for theoretical studies. This work will elucidate the impact
of the protein electrostatic environment, solvent accessibility, and conformational motions on PCET. It will also
provide insights into how individual PCET steps are coupled to each other and to protein conformational motions
and what determines the order of the steps and the overall rate. Discovering the factors that impact biological
PCET is vital for understanding and controlling a wide range of essential biochemical processes. These
fundamental insights may also have broader implications for protein design and optogenetics."
10755665,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although treatment exists for late-stage diabetic retinopathy (DR) and macular edema, interventions to inhibit
DR onset and worsening, other than glycemic control, have generally not been successful. To identify novel
DR therapeutic targets, we studied Joslin 50-Year Medalists (N=1019), all of whom have type 1 diabetes
(T1D) for 50-87 years. The presence of DR protective factors is supported by a bimodal distribution of DR in
this cohort; 41% of Medalists have no-mild DR and 47% have quiescent proliferative DR (QPDR) despite no
significant difference in glycemic control. Longitudinal data for up to 60 years shows that Medalists protected
from proliferative DR (PDR) did not experience DR worsening after their first 17 years of diabetes. Mass
spectrometry of post-mortem retina and vitreous found a novel protective factor, interphotoreceptor retinol-
binding protein 3 (RBP3), to be elevated in Medalists with no-mild DR despite poor glycemic control. Our
paper in Science Transl. Medicine (2019) confirmed that RBP3 is elevated in the retina and vitreous of
Medalists with no-mild DR versus Medalists and non-Medalists with QPDR, and that RBP3 in the retina and
vitreous of diabetic individuals is lower than in non-diabetic controls. RBP3 overexpression in in vivo studies
by lentivirus subretinal injection, embryonically by transgene targeting photoreceptors or intravitreous
injection of recombinant RBP3, inhibited retinal VEGF and IL-6 expression and normalized vascular
permeability, electroretinogram changes and acellular capillaries in diabetic rodents. Mechanistic studies
showed that in Muller and endothelial cells, RBP3 binds to cell surface proteins including GLUT-1 to decrease
glucose uptake and glycolytic flux, neutralizing adverse actions of hyperglycemia. We developed a sensitive
and specific ELISA assay that showed RBP3 levels in the vitreous and serum (at 1/1000 of vitreous levels)
were correlated with each other and with DR severity, and inversely correlated with vitreous VEGF. RBP3
expression in photoreceptor cells was reduced by high glucose, possibly due to protein kinase C (PKC) δ 
activation and inhibition of serum reactive factor (SRF) transcription factor via the Akt pathway. Preliminary
studies of RBP3 subdomains show structure-function activities for inhibiting glucose uptake by binding to
GLUT-1 transporters and reducing VEGF and IL-6 expression in Muller cells. The specific aims proposed
are: Sp. Aim 1: To characterize and compare RBP3 levels in the retina, vitreous and serum as a potential
biomarker for DR in T1D and T2D patients at the Joslin Diabetes Center, with validation in the Finland
FinnDiane T1D cohort and DRCR Protocol T (T2D) cohort. Sp. Aim 2: To determine the mechanism for
hyperglycemia-induced downregulation of RBP3 expression in photoreceptors in vivo and in a photoreceptor
cell line by activation of PKCδ  and deactivation of the Akt/mTOR/S6K pathway and SRF transcription factor.
Sp. Aim 3: To define structure-function relationships between the RBP3 full length protein and its
subdomains with regard to interaction with GLUT-1 and glucose uptake in Müller and retinal endothelial cells."
10742903,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In ecological listening environments, individuals must direct attention toward a specific source (e.g., the voice of
a friend) while ignoring simultaneous background noise (e.g., other patrons in a café). Moreover, listeners must
direct attention toward specific dimensions within an auditory source (e.g., frequencies useful for distinguishing
between different speech sounds). A widely held but untested assumption is that these source-based and
dimension-based forms of auditory selective attention are supported by common mechanisms. Human studies
have historically focused on source-based attention using speech stimuli, while nonhuman animal studies have
primarily investigated dimension-based attention with non-speech stimuli; there is thus an empirical gap between
these literatures, making it unclear how well the animal studies can model human behavior. More generally, the
mechanisms that support auditory selective attention remain underspecified. For instance, extant research
suggests that selective attention involves enhancing representations of key information, but it is unclear whether
selective attention also involves actively suppressing irrelevant information. Thus, the goal of the proposed
project is to clarify the cognitive and neural mechanisms that support auditory selective attention. The first aim
is to determine whether auditory selective attention involves suppression of irrelevant information. The key
scientific premise is to use training as a tool for triangulating mechanism. That is, if selective attention involves
suppression of irrelevant auditory dimensions, then training that improves a listener’s ability to suppress
irrelevant auditory information should be associated with concomitant gains in auditory selective attention.
Listeners will receive eight days of auditory training that either will require them to perform increasingly fine-
grained processing in a target frequency band (promoting enriched representations of target dimensions) or will
place increasing demands on the extent to which they must suppress irrelevant auditory dimensions (e.g., a non-
target frequency band). Of interest is whether training is associated with improved auditory selective attention,
as measured through classic behavioral and electrophysiological indices of attention. The second aim is to
determine whether different forms of auditory selective attention (e.g., source-based and dimension-based) are
supported by common mechanisms. If they are, then training that leads to improvements in one type of auditory
selective attention (e.g., dimension-based) should generalize to another (e.g., source-based). Listeners will
complete tests of generalization before, midway through, and after the training regimen. Of interest is whether
an improved ability to attend to target auditory dimensions is associated with an improved ability to direct
attention toward a specific source. Tests will also assess whether training with non-speech stimuli generalizes
to speech. The results will provide insight into the extent to which different forms of auditory selective attention
are supported by common mechanisms. Overall, the proposed work will clarify the mechanisms supporting
auditory selective attention and provide a vital missing link between the nonhuman animal and human literatures."
10669779,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of this R21 proposal is to test the hypothesis that DNA vaccines induce durable innate
memory in HIV-infected humans by characterizing the evolution of the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape
in subjects who have been immunized using a novel HIV DNA vaccine. We recently used a “systems
immunology” approach to successfully map the epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of immunity to
influenza vaccination in healthy humans. Vaccination against seasonal influenza, with or without AS03 adjuvant,
resulted in persistently reduced expression of H3K27ac in monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), which
was associated with impaired cytokine responses to toll like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Single cell analysis
revealed an epigenomically-distinct subcluster of myeloid cells with reduced chromatin accessibility at activator
protein-1 (AP-1) targeted loci after vaccination, persistently increased chromatin accessibility at loci targeted by
interferon (IFN) response factors (IRFs), which was associated with elevated expression of antiviral genes, type
1 IFN production, and heightened resistance to infection with the heterologous viruses Zika and dengue. In
another recent paper, we have shown that the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA prime-boost vaccine (BNT162b2) resulted
in enhanced innate immune responses, evidenced by a greater frequency of CD14+CD16+ inflammatory
monocytes, higher plasma IFN-γ, and a transcriptional signature of innate antiviral immunity. We will replicate
this “systems immunology” framework to characterize innate memory using peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) from HIV+ subjects in the A5369 prime-boost DNA vaccine trial (NCT03560258). Induction and
durability of innate memory will be studied across 3 aims in this R21. Aim 1 will identify histone posttranslational
modifications (HPTMs) in PBMCs at single-cell resolution using Epigenetic Landscape Profiling using Cytometry
by Time Of Flight (EpiTOF). We will test the hypothesis that antigen-specific DNA vaccination induces innate
memory through epigenetic reprogramming, expands with each sequential prime and boost (week 0 < week 6
<< week 26), and is preserved at week 48. Aim 2 will identify gene transcript modules, and their evolution over
time, associated with innate memory. We will test the hypothesis that antigen-specific DNA vaccination induces
durable innate memory through transcriptomic changes and expands with each sequential prime and boost
(week 0 << week 26 > week 48). We will test the hypothesis that transcriptional modules that characterize innate
memory in influenza and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are generalizable to HIV DNA vaccines. We also expect to
identify unique subsets of cells, transcripts, and pathways associated with innate memory that differ from
influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Aim 3 will perform systems immunology analysis by integrating EpiTOF and
transcriptomic data from Aims 1 &2, and comparing with similar data from influenza and SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated
subjects testing the hypothesis that there are generalizable mechanisms underlying innate memory across
vaccine platforms, and cells and pathways specific to DNA vaccines and/or HIV infection."
10746422,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a deadly neurodegenerative disorder whose pathogenesis remains unknown. The
disease is caused by aberrant polyglutamine expansion in Huntingtin (Htt), a pleiotropic protein with essential
functions during development. Using genetically modified mouse models to temporally regulate gene expression
during the developmental period, previous works from Molero et al., revealed that either exposure to mutant Htt,
or loss of normal Htt elicits HD during midlife. These findings demonstrate that events taking place during neural
development play pathogenic roles in the disease. Interestingly, both mutant and loss-of-function models exhibit
early interneuron deficits. This application presents evidence that the early ontogenic rescue of interneurons
delayed disease onset and ameliorated disease progression in a model of HD, which supports the role of
interneurons in disease pathogenesis. The overall objective of this proposal is to define the mechanisms
disrupting interneuron production, and the ensuing pathogenic cascade mediated by these cells. Our central
hypothesis is that changes in subpallial cell-cycle dynamics and migration dampen the neurogenic output of
interneurons, resulting in the disruption of corticostriatal connectivity, circuit maldeveloment, activation of stress
responses and the generation of “metastable” cells with lower reserves to cope with stress. This hypothesis will
be interrogated with three specific aims: (1) elucidate the underpinnings of the deficient interneuron neurogenic
output; (2) determine the effects of interneuron deficits on corticostriatal circuit maturation; (3) identify and
characterize developmentally vulnerable cells. The first aim will employ: a cell-cycle phase biosensor to define
cell-cycle length and checkpoints; organotypic cultures, fate mapping techniques and time-lapse microscopy to
define interneuron migration; and molecular studies to define DNA damage within interneuron germinative
domains. For the second aim, whole-cell patch clamping in acute slides and in-vivo optogenetic techniques will
be employed to define the establishment of the of thalamocortical feedforward circuit and the functional
maturation of the striatum. Lastly, the third aim will employ a cellular stress reporter system to map
“developmentally stressed” cells, define their survival throughout ontogenesis, and determine their molecular
signature. The proposed research is significant because it will elucidate the primary mechanisms underlying
developmental deficits with key pathogenic roles in disease occurrence, uncovering a novel window for
therapeutic interventions encompassing a potential array of novel disease-relevant targets. Moreover, these
studies have important implications for our understanding of HD comorbidities and would provide an original
methodological approach to interrogate related neurological disorders, particularly those involving polyglutamine
expansions. The application is innovative because upon confirming of our hypothesis, it would shift the focus of
current research efforts from mechanistic processes acting on the mature brain to events operating in the earliest
incipient stages of the disease prodrome, thereby introducing a paradigm shift in the field."
10733420,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Endothelial cells that line blood and lymphatic vessels are abundant in the small intestine niche. Interestingly, in
the last decade, several groups have shown that endothelial cells have a role beyond “plumbing” and secrete
paracrine factors supporting the stem cell maintenance and regeneration of various tissues. Although ISCs
renew rapidly and continuously to sustain metabolic health, the role of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in the
ISC niche is not well-established. Notably, LECs are known to express high levels of Rspo3, one of the WNT
signaling molecules required in the niche for ISC self-renewal. In my work, I have further made the observation
that the WNT modulator Wls is also highly expressed by LECs in the small intestine. In addition to putative roles
in homeostatic turnover, several lines of evidence suggest that endothelial cells become activated in response
to intestinal injury to drive epithelial recovery. Despite this knowledge, whether LEC derived WNT signaling in
the intestinal niche is essential for ISC regeneration after cytotoxic injury remains unknown. Based on this
premise, I aim to study the role of LECs in a model of chemotherapy-induced intestinal injury, a frequent and
devastating inflammatory condition that affects cancer patients.
The overarching goal of my project is to understand how endothelial cells contribute to ISC regeneration and I
propose that, in part, this is achieved through secretion of the WNT modulators RSPO3 and WLS by LECs. For
this reason, I have generated crosses to obtain mouse models in which either Rspo3 or Wls are selectively
knocked out from LECs in adult mice. My preliminary data indicate that in mice where Rspo3 has been deleted
from LECs in adult mice, there is a delayed recovery of ISCs after 5FU injury. I plan to further corroborate these
results in mice where Wls is deleted from LECs. Additionally, I will generate single cell RNA sequencing data to
determine transcriptional changes in crypt epithelial cells after 5FU injury in mice where Rspo3 has been knocked
out from LECs. Lastly, I will dissect changes in LECs as they relate to epithelial repair after 5FU injury. Together,
the proposed studies will define how signals from the lymphatic niche contribute to ISC regeneration and more
broadly will identify a potential novel intestinal niche component that can be therapeutically targeted to stimulate
intestinal repair."
10729518,"I have been conducting research in health services, epidemiology, and implementation science at the Hines
VA Medical Center, HSR&D Center of Innovation for Complex Chronic Healthcare (CINCCH) for over 19
years. My primary area of research has focused on Veterans with SCI/D, whom are at increased risk for
infections and acquiring multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs). Little research had been conducted in this
patient population, particularly in the VA which is the single largest source of care for persons with SCI/D in
the U.S. My research has made significant impacts on the care of Veterans with SCI/D. This includes
developing and disseminating a toolkit on prevention of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
colonization/infection for patients with SCI/D; educating clinicians about the modifiable risk factors of
MDROs and impacts on morbidity and mortality in this population, and working collaboratively with clinicians
and investigators across the country to develop tools for monitoring and tracking outcomes in Veterans with
SCI/D, including the new VHA SCI/D outcomes registry. I have also expanded this work to a broader VA
population including leading a QUERI program on antimicrobial resistance. Overall, this portfolio of research
has led to 119 publications (45 first/senior author) and national prestige as a recipient of the Presidential
Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) in 2012, awarded by the United States
president and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. In addition, as a doctoral level
epidemiologist, my methodological training has allowed me to support the research activities of
collaborators across the country. I also conduct mentoring activities for both clinician and non-clinician
investigators, fellows, and students and participate in service activities for both VA and non-VA workgroups
and committees. This award will be used to: 1) conduct and disseminate research that improves the health
care and outcomes of Veterans, with a particular focus on prevention and management of infections and
MDROs; 2) support the quantitative training and mentoring of students, fellows, and early career
investigators; and 3) provide service to local and national committees to support the mission of VA, the
HSR&D program, and CINCCH."
10729508,"Background: Nearly 25% of Veterans are estimated to be food insecure (FI), experiencing limited or uncertain
access to nutritionally adequate and safe foods. FI has been associated with a wide range of adverse health
outcomes as well as increased healthcare costs and utilization. Concerningly, FI is frequently under-
recognized in clinical settings including VHA. Prior research has shown that clinicians and other care team
members often feel ill equipped to address FI even once identified. As such, there is a critical need to
determine how to most effectively connect FI Veterans with relevant services and community resources in
order to address Veteran FI and its downstream consequences.
Gaps Addressed (Knowledge and Practice): In October 2017 the VA launched a national FI clinical
reminder intended to screen all Veterans receiving care in the VHA. In the first 24 months of screening, the
reminder identified over 77,000 Veterans across the country that reported FI. Little is known, however, about
the variation in screening across VA sites; how sites respond when a Veteran screens positive for FI; or what
VHA practices following a positive screen best improve Veteran food security status, Veteran experiences of
care, and health outcomes. This proposed application would address these knowledge gaps.
Innovativeness: Although VHA has begun to address social determinants of health more broadly, efforts to
address FI are still in their nascency. This proposal, and the future area of research it will foster, is innovative
because it seeks to develop novel VA-community partnerships that address key social determinants of health
contributing to adverse health outcomes. This proposal further innovates through its emphasis on multi-level
stakeholder engagement including strong Veteran engagement, and seeking Veteran-centered approaches to
addressing food insecurity.
Specific Aims: My long-term career goal is to become national leader in developing, evaluating, and
implementing effective interventions to address Veteran FI and other social determinants of health. Through
this CDA-2 application, I will build upon my prior training in family medicine and health services research to
acquire advanced skills in implementation science, intervention design, and mixed methods evaluation. I
propose the following research aims: Aim 1: Examine variation across VA sites nationally in implementation of
the FI clinical reminder and characterize implementation experiences and community referral processes; Aim
2: Understand Veteran experiences of FI and their interactions with VA and community resources following a
positive FI screen; Aim 3: Develop and pilot test an intervention model to optimize screening and referral
processes for connecting FI Veterans to relevant VA and community resources.
Methodology: This proposal employs a multistage mixed methods framework with integrated analyses across
aims.
Next Steps: When completed, this proposed work will evaluate current approaches to Veteran FI and identify
and pilot strategies to integrate VHA-community partnered interventions to address FI into clinical practice.
Findings will lay the foundation for a future IIR to conduct a multi-site trial of an intervention model. Further, the
proposed research and training will help launch my career as an independent physician-investigator committed
to providing a rigorous, scientific basis for reducing Veteran FI and related social determinants of health in a
way that is Veteran-centered, maximizes patient autonomy, and optimizes health outcomes."
10767184,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents a serious affliction affecting millions globally. Despite
recent advances in pharmacological and percutaneous interventions, CVD remains the leading cause of death
and disability in the world. One of the main therapeutic challenges facing atherosclerotic CVD is the delivery of
therapies to the atherosclerotic plaque that target the specific cells which contribute to its formation, while
protecting the endothelium. Vascular endothelial cells provide crucial protection against lipid uptake,
inflammation and thrombosis. We hypothesize that cell-selective therapy that inhibits infiltration of inflammatory
cells and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, while protecting endothelia cell function will be effective
in combating CVD and thrombosis. To achieve this goal, we will develop a novel miRNA switch that combines
synthetically modified mRNA with miRNA target site. As a delivery platform we will utilize the cationic amphipathic
cell-penetrating peptide that forms a self-assembled, compacted, nanoparticle when mixed with synthetic mRNA.
Moreover, to increase the targeting of inflammation in the atherosclerotic plaque, we will combine the miRNA
switch together with siRNA targeting IL1-β to generate nanoparticles using the same cationic amphipathic cell-
penetrating peptide. In two specific aims, we will test 1) the efficacy of this cell-selective nanotherapy to inhibit
atherosclerosis and restenosis after percutaneous intervention, while protecting EC to reduce thrombosis; and
2) the translational potential of the miRNA switch nanotherapy in viable, isolated human coronary arteries.
Completion of the aims will provide the foundation for the development of a novel category of biological drugs
that can accommodate the advent of personalized medicine and will advance the treatment of cardiovascular
disease."
10760211,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background and aims: Serotonin (5-HT) exerts numerous physiological functions in the gastrointestinal tract via
activation of 14 different serotonin receptor subtypes. Elevated serotonin levels are noted in response to tissue
damage, indicating that serotonin release may mediate important repair mechanisms. Serotonin has been shown
to have reparative effects on skin injury and gastric ulcers, and serotonin receptor 4 (5-HTR4) specifically has
been shown to have anti-ulcerogenic action after colon tissue damage. However, the mechanism behind this
phenomenon is unclear. Recently 5-HTR4 has been identified on goblet cells, which are known to produce trefoil
factor 3 (TFF3); a key compound in intestinal repair. Currently the link between 5-HTR4 and TFF3 is unknown.
Preliminary data generated using human intestinal enteroids has demonstrated that exogenous serotonin
stimulates TFF3 release to promote repair in live imaging wound healing assays. This effect was mitigated by
inhibition of the TFF3 receptor CXCR4. In a microbial-centered approach, our lab has also identified a single
commensal bacterium, Bifidobacterium dentium, which in gnotobiotic mice and in mouse and human enteroids
is able to stimulate serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells. Additionally, treatment of human enteroids
with B. dentium metabolites also enhance epithelial restitution in a wound healing assay, similar to exogenous
serotonin. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that serotonin activates 5-HTR4 on goblet cells to stimulate
TFF3 release, which acts on its receptor CXCR4 to mediate signaling cascades responsible for epithelial repair.
Aim 1 seeks to define the requirement of TFF3 for 5-HTR4 mediated epithelial repair in vivo using mouse models
and colonoscopy-induced colonic wounds. Aim 2 seeks to examine a microbial approach for stimulating
serotonin production and wound healing in vivo. Finally, Aim 3 addresses the signaling cascade required for
TFF3 mediated restitution in intestinal epithelial cells in mouse and human colonic enteroids in vitro. Mucosal
healing is critical for in the treatment of ulcers, surgical anastomoses, enterocutaneous fistulae and inflammatory
bowel disease wounds. Failure to properly heal wounds can result in complications including infection, prolonged
hospitalization, and critical illness. Long-term objective and aims: My long-term goal is to become a productive
independent investigator at research institution. Receiving a K01 Career Development Award would better equip me
to achieve this goal. My research is well suited for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases as it relates to intestinal wound repair. My current institution, Baylor College of Medicine, offers the scientific
resources required to complete this proposal. Additionally, I have assembled a group of renowned scientists to serve
on my mentorship committee and leaders in the fields of microbiology and wound repair to serve as my mentors. In
collaboration with my mentors, I have developed a training plan that will allow me master advanced scientific
techniques, increase my publication record and secure independent funding. At the completion of this award, I believe
I will have the resources and expertise required to transition to an independent principle investigator."
10764202,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex diseases like COPD have identified many genomic
regions associated with disease, but the molecular mechanisms by which these genetic loci influence disease
pathogenesis are largely unknown. The phenotypic effects of genetic alterations can result from disruptions of
the coordinated interactions between proteins. However, the key genes within COPD GWAS loci have only been
proven in a minority of those COPD GWAS regions, and network connections between the COPD GWAS gene
products have rarely been identified. In this project, we will utilize COPD susceptibility genes supported by both
GWAS and murine emphysema models to develop cell type-specific and disease-specific protein-protein
interaction network modules related to COPD. We hypothesize that building disease network modules based on
experimentally validated protein-protein interactions between COPD GWAS genes will identify novel biological
connections that influence COPD-related disease processes of cell death, cellular senescence, and/or
inflammation. We will perform affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP-MS) assays of nine well-established
COPD GWAS gene products. Interacting proteins that are part of network links between COPD GWAS genes
based on the AP-MS assays will be further validated with co-immunoprecipitation assays. We will utilize disease
network module building approaches that combine the new AP-MS experiments with existing molecular
interactome data to find biological linkages between COPD GWAS gene products. We will identify cell type-
specific protein-protein interaction networks by removing non-expressed genes based on RNA-Seq data in
bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, and disease-specific protein-protein interaction networks
based on TOPMed RNA-Seq data from lung tissue in the Lung Tissue Research Consortium. For network paths
linking COPD GWAS genes in the protein-protein interaction network, we will perturb disease network module
components using CRISPR-Cas9 approaches. First, we will assess the effects of these perturbations on protein
interactions of putative disease network paths. Second, we will assess the impact of these network node removal
perturbations on cell-based COPD-related readouts, including cell death, cellular senescence, and inflammation.
Positive phenotypic readouts in cell line experiments will be validated in primary human lung cells. This project
will combine state-of-the-art computational and laboratory approaches to identify the protein-protein interaction
network relationships between COPD GWAS genes within multiple lung cell types and to validate those network
relationships using cell-based readouts of relevant biological processes for COPD pathogenesis."
10731061,"Background: Half of all Veterans are aged 65 or older. Age and associated chronic conditions increase risk
for functional limitations, defined as difficulty performing day-to-day activities. This is significant not only
because older Veterans place a high priority on maintaining function, but also because the manifestation of
limitations signifies elevated risk for adverse outcomes. Effective interventions are needed to help older
Veterans maintain independence in the community. This project will adapt an empirically-supported
psychosocial therapy for depression – behavioral activation (BA) – to promote physical, cognitive, and social
functioning in community-dwelling older Veterans at risk for functional decline. As a brief intervention that
increases engagement in values-aligned activities, BA is a promising approach to support functioning.
Specific Aims and Methods: We will develop and pilot test a six-week telehealth-delivered BA intervention,
“Behavioral Activation for Independence in Older Veterans” (ACTIVaTE). The intervention will be designed to
increase engagement in meaningful activities in line with individual values. The target population is older
Veterans (age ≥65) enrolled in VA primary care who are at risk for functional decline, defined as a score of ≥3
on the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13). This will be accomplished over three aims:
Aim 1. Adapt: We will develop ACTIVaTE based on an existing BA model (Brief Behavioral Activation
Treatment for Depression-Revised) for delivery to older Veterans at risk for functional decline via VA Video
Connect (VVC). Our previous experience with BA will inform the initial adaptation, incorporating perspectives
from primary care, geropsychology, and occupational therapy. We will seek feedback on the preliminary
manual and participant workbook via semi-structured interviews with VA psychologists (n=5), occupational
therapists (n=5), and Veterans (n=5), using findings to further modify the materials.
Aim 2. Refine: We will conduct an open trial of ACTIVaTE delivered via VVC in 10 older Veterans at risk for
functional decline, using mixed methods to determine preliminary acceptability of the intervention. Further
refinements will be made to the intervention based on findings from qualitative interviews and a satisfaction
survey using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability.
Aim 3. Test: We will conduct a pilot RCT of ACTIVaTE versus attention control in 48 older Veterans with VES-
13 score ≥3 recruited from primary care. We will collect clinical measures at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks,
using the Ambulatory Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) and PROMIS Satisfaction with Social Roles and
Activities as primary measures of physical, cognitive, and social functioning. We will also conduct semi-
structured interviews with a purposive sample of participants based on satisfaction and adherence. Feasibility
will be determined by enrollment and retention and acceptability will be determined by adherence and
satisfaction, as well as by themes from qualitative interviews. Preliminary impact on AM-PAC and PROMIS will
be explored through within and between groups mixed-effects linear regression models and proportions of
participants who achieve minimal clinically important change in outcomes.
Impact: This project will adapt an evidence-based intervention for depression (BA) for a novel purpose:
promoting functional independence in older Veterans. Through VVC delivery, it has potential for scalability and
implications for isolated and rural Veterans. Data will be used to inform the design of a future full-scale efficacy
trial (RR&D Merit Award). In parallel with my research aims, I will obtain training in behavioral and rehabilitation
science, methodology (clinical trials design and analytic techniques), grant writing and scholarly dissemination,
and leadership. While supporting the development of an innovative, values-aligned treatment targeting
functioning, this CDA-2 will also promote my growth into an independently-funded VA physician investigator
innovating at the interface of primary care, behavioral health, and rehabilitation."
10752628,"Background: Clinician performance is a critical determinant of high-quality care delivery and patient outcomes.
VA medical centers assess clinicians with Ongoing and Focused Professional Practice Evaluations (OPPE and
FPPE), which require bi-annual chart abstraction by clinicians to assess for adherence to quality measures.
This process is inefficient, lacks evidence of validity or impact, and has been the subject of multiple
investigations by the Office of the Inspector General. VA has therefore committed to establishing national
standards of practice for all clinicians for use in OPPE/FPPE. The Office of Specialty Care has selected a set
of 154 performance indicators across 33 subspecialities. Of these, cardiology is best positioned to test novel
methods for clinician assessment because of existing evidence-based quality measures and established
mechanisms for quality measurement via the Clinical Assessment, Reporting and Tracking (CART) program.
Significance: Two critical knowledge gaps prevent effective performance assessment of cardiology providers in
VA: 1) existing quality measures for general cardiology practice have not been tested for validity and reliability;
and 2) effective case-based peer review methods are unavailable for outpatient cardiology care. Since these
two assessment methods are linked both conceptually and in current VA practice, we propose to test both in a
novel, mixed methods study. Our overall goal is to provide practical tools to assess VA cardiology clinicians
while demonstrating proof-of-concept of this novel paradigm.
Innovation and Impact: These novel assessment methods would free VA clinicians from the burden of low-
value chart abstraction, advance VA’s commitment to be a High Reliability Organization, and improve the
overall quality and safety of Veteran healthcare. In addition, the research will provide generalizable knowledge
to advance the field of clinician performance assessment and improvement.
Specific aims: 1) To assess the reliability and validity of quality measures obtained from electronic health
record data for cardiology clinician assessment; 2) To test the validity of case-based peer review of cardiology
clinician performance; and 3) To identify barriers and facilitators to the use of these assessment methodologies
for OPPE/FPPE in VA practice.
Methodology: This mixed-methods study will build on the evidence-based Clinical Practice Feedback
Intervention Theory and existing methods of quality assessment and peer review for cardiac procedures. In
Aim 1, we will use electronic health record data to assess cardiology clinician performance on 4 indicators that
are currently used for OPPE. Measures will be tested for reliability and validity. A composite measure will be
developed to provide a summary assessment of clinician performance. In Aim 2, we will engage expert
clinicians and other stakeholders to develop and test a web-based platform for blinded, case-based peer
review. We will determine the reliability of peer review assessments and determine the optimal number of
reviews. Finally, we will interview and survey clinicians to determine how these assessment methodologies
may impact clinical care and can be most effectively implemented in practice.
Next Steps/Implementation: This research will develop a trustworthy method for review of clinician
performance that could replace the current inefficient and ineffective OPPE/FPPE process. We will work with
our partners in the Program Offices of Cardiology and Specialty Care to implement in practice."
10763371,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obesity is a global pandemic with accelerating trends in morbidity, mortality, and medical expenditures.
Treatments have been limited in efficacy or burdened with safety concerns. Leptin is a potent anorexigenic
hormone and compelling candidate to treat diet-induced obesity (DIO). However, DIO induces leptin resistance,
in part, by downregulating leptin receptors (LepRs) on the surface of hypothalamic neurons, rendering leptin
therapy ineffective. Overcoming leptin resistance has emerged as a promising goal for obesity therapy. Recently,
we discovered that the guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY2C) receptor is specifically expressed in hypothalamic LepR(+)
neurons. Like LepR, hypothalamic GUCY2C induces satiety through binding of its hormone, uroguanylin,
produced in intestine. In DIO, uroguanylin expression is lost, silencing hypothalamic GUCY2C. Importantly,
reconstitution of GUCY2C signaling restores leptin sensitivity and produces weight loss in DIO mice. These data
suggest that loss of intestinal uroguanylin in obesity produces leptin resistance by silencing GUCY2C signaling
in hypothalamus, decreasing cell-surface LepR. The ultimate long-term goal of this project is to elucidate
mechanisms by which GUCY2C signaling in hypothalamus regulates satiety and resists weight gain, to inform
the utility of GUCY2C ligand therapy in the treatment and prevention of obesity. To achieve this goal, three
specific aims are proposed. Aim 1, the pathophysiologic aim, will demonstrate that the uroguanylin-GUCY2C
axis regulates leptin sensitivity. Leveraging unique tissue-specific conditional mouse models developed by
our laboratory, we will measure leptin sensitivity of mice before and after eliminating the uroguanylin-GUCY2C
signaling axis. Leptin sensitivity in mice with altered GUCY2C signaling will be assessed through phenotypic
analysis of satiety and metabolism, and biochemical analysis of LepR signaling. Aim 2, the mechanistic aim, will
establish that GUCY2C signaling controls the availability of neuronal surface LepRs. Preliminary data
suggest that LepR signaling is reduced in GUCY2C-/- mice. We will use LepR(+) neurons enriched from LepR
reporter mice to quantify the effect of GUCY2C signaling on LepR translocation to the cell surface and signaling.
Finally, Aim 3, the therapeutic aim, will define the ability of GUCY2C ligands to overcome leptin resistance
in DIO mice. Here, we will use clinically available GUCY2C ligands, and mice with a conditional uroguanylin
transgene, to reconstitute hypothalamic GUCY2C signaling in DIO mice. Using methods described in Aim 1, we
will explore the effects of exogenous or transgenic GUCY2C ligand supplementation on hypothalamic leptin
signaling in DIO animals. These studies will reveal new mechanisms contributing to obesity, and novel solutions
to overcome canonical leptin resistance and alleviate dysregulation of appetite and satiety in obesity. The
potential to translate these results into patients is underscored by approval of GUCY2C ligands to treat chronic
constipation syndromes, offering the exciting opportunity of using these ligands to treat obesity."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder caused primarily by the
degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2
(LRRK2) gene cause late-onset, autosomal dominant PD, and LRRK2 coding and non-coding variants are
associated with risk of sporadic PD. LRRK2 has emerged has an important therapeutic target for treating PD
and therefore it is critical to understand the key mechanisms underlying disease-linked mutations. LRRK2 is a
large multi-domain protein containing Ras-of-Complex (Roc) GTPase and protein kinase enzymatic domains
separated by a C-terminal-of-Roc (COR) domain. GTP-binding via the Roc domain is critical for normal kinase
activity. Familial LRRK2 mutations cluster within the Roc (R1441C/G/H), COR (Y1699C) and kinase (G2019S,
I2020T) domains where they commonly enhance the phosphorylation of a subset of Rab GTPase substrates in
cells. Roc-COR domain mutations act indirectly on kinase activity by impairing GTP hydrolysis and promoting
the GTP-bound `on' state. The GTPase and kinase domains represent promising targets for inhibiting LRRK2.
While familial LRRK2 mutations share the capacity to induce neuronal damage in cultured cells, their effects in
animal models are less certain due to a lack of robust neurodegenerative phenotypes. In addition, how the two
enzymatic activities contribute to neuronal damage in vivo induced by familial LRRK2 mutations is poorly
understood. We have recently developed an adenoviral-mediated gene transfer model in adult rats where
G2019S LRRK2 induces nigrostriatal pathway dopaminergic neurodegeneration through a kinase-dependent
mechanism. In the present application, we propose to exploit this robust and rapid rodent model to determine
whether kinase activity is commonly required for neurodegeneration induced by familial mutations (R1441C,
Y1699C and G2019S) or PD risk variants (G2385R) in LRRK2 by genetic and pharmacological kinase inhibition
(Aim 1.1). The contribution of Rab phosphorylation to neuronal damage induced by mutant LRRK2 is not known.
We will determine the neuroprotective effects of globally reducing Rab phosphorylation in mutant LRRK2
neuronal and adenoviral rat models by overexpressing a novel Rab-specific phosphatase, PPM1H (Aim 1.2).
Knockdown of PPM1H will explore whether increasing Rab phosphorylation is sufficient to phenocopy the
neurotoxic effects of mutant LRRK2. Our studies will further explore whether genetically modulating GTPase
activity can provide a common neuroprotective mechanism against different familial LRRK2 mutations in rodents
(Aim 2.1). In particular, we will evaluate hypothesis-testing mutations that increase GTP hydrolysis and promote
the GDP-bound `off' state of LRRK2. Finally, we will explore how the native interactome of LRRK2 in neurons is
regulated by the GTPase cycle to identify novel protein targets that interact with LRRK2 in its GDP- or GTP-
bound states (Aim 2.2). Our studies will provide critical mechanistic insight into how GTPase and kinase activity
regulate LRRK2-mediated neurodegeneration, and will be important for therapeutic discovery efforts for PD."

active IL-1β and IL-18 in response to bacterial toxins, particulate matter and certain endogenous stimuli.
Furthermore, aberrant activation of NLRP3 has been linked to the pathogenesis of several acquired
inflammatory disorders including gouty arthritis, silicosis, atherosclerosis, diabetes and Alzheimer’s
disease. Although much progress has been made about the stimuli and cellular events that activate the
NLRP3 inflammasome, a major gap in the field is the identification of molecules that are required for
NLRP3 activation and the mechanism of caspase-1 activation in response to NLRP3 activating stimuli. The
Nek7 kinase was identified during the last cycle of the grant as a critical factor required for NLRP3
activation in response to a wide array of stimuli in vitro and in vivo. Nek7 was shown to act downstream of
K+ efflux to activate NLRP3. However, the mechanism by which K+ efflux activates NLRP3 via Nek7
remains unknown. Furthermore, the molecular events by which NLRP3 activates caspase-1 via the adaptor
ASC to induce ASC oligomerization and ASC speck formation are poorly understood. In this renewal
application, we propose studies in three specific Aims to (i) determine how K+ efflux activates the NLRP3
inflammasome through the kinase Nek7 using biochemical and in vivo approaches; (ii) identify factors that
regulate the phosphorylation of Nek7 to mediate the activation of NLRP3 and (iii) further characterize the
role of actin-based motor proteins in the mechanism of ASC-mediated inflammasome activation.
Understanding how NLRP3 is activated is expected to provide critical insight into the role of the
inflammasomes in different biological systems which will aid the development of new therapeutic
approaches to prevent and/or treat inflammasome-associated diseases."

Hearing loss caused by noise, aging and chemotherapy affects seven hundred million people worldwide, but
there are no FDA-approved drugs to prevent it. This research will test the potential to repurpose a small
molecule BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib (TAFINLAR), an FDA-approved drug for several cancers, for new use in
preventing cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Dabrafenib was a top hit in our unbiased high-throughput screens of
4,385 bioactive compounds and 187 specific kinase inhibitors for cisplatin-induced cell-death protection in an
inner ear cell line. We found that dabrafenib fully protected the outer hair cells against cisplatin toxicity in
mouse cochlear explants with IC50 of 30 nM and an excellent therapeutic index (LD50/IC50) of >2000.
Mechanistically, we identified dabrafenib and three additional BRAF inhibitors, two MEK1/2 inhibitors, and an
ERK1/2 inhibitor immediately downstream of BRAF in the cellular pathway, supporting the role of BRAF in
cisplatin-induced hair cell death. Cisplatin treatment of the inner ear cell line caused upregulation of phospho-
BRAF, phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 that was inhibited by co-treatment with dabrafenib. Moreover,
cisplatin treatment of cochlear explants or noise exposure in vivo caused up-regulation of phospho-ERK1/2
short time after damage in supporting cells (inner phalangeal and Deiters’ cells) that was mitigated by
dabrafenib treatment. Furthermore, at 100 nM dabrafenib protected zebrafish lateral line neuromasts from
cisplatin-induced death in vivo and, importantly, significant protection was achieved with oral delivery of
dabrafenib for three consecutive days in mouse models against cisplatin-induced hearing loss. The daily dose
of dabrafenib administered to the mice was in the range approved for long-term human treatment. In this
proposal, we will test the protection provided by dabrafenib for cisplatin-induced hearing loss in a multiple low
dose cisplatin regimen that mimics closely the cisplatin treatment of cancer patients in the clinic. Functional
auditory performance and inner ear morphology will be assessed. Two doses of dabrafenib will be tested to
evaluate the therapeutic window of the drug in vivo. We will also determine dabrafenib’s interference with
cisplatin tumor killing efficacy in tumor cell lines and mouse tumor models in which cisplatin is the standard
treatment, neuroblastoma and lung cancer. We will confirm BRAF kinase is the molecular target of dabrafenib
in cisplatin-induced hearing loss by generating a supporting cell specific conditional knockout mouse in which
BRAF is specifically deleted in the supporting cells of the inner ear starting at postnatal day 28 and testing its
resistance to cisplatin. Supporting cells’ ERK phosphorylation can serve as an in vivo biomarker for cisplatin
damage and evaluating treatment with BRAF inhibitors and can be utilized to determine dabrafenib’s PK/PD
properties. Our study will reveal a new cellular pathway and molecular target BRAF kinase for otoprotection
and will provide the crucial data needed for advancing dabrafenib to clinical trials in humans for prevention of
cisplatin-induced hearing loss."
10755610,"Abstract. Understanding the functions of lipids, proteins and even larger macromolecular assemblies
depends on deciphering complex structures of individual molecules as well as decrypting how those
molecules interact, often via networks of non-covalent interactions. In order to advance the elucidation of
biomolecular organization and functional outcomes, new methods are needed to push the limits of
structural insight, providing more detailed holistic chemical information with greater sensitivity. The critical
interplay between structure/function is evidenced in numerous biologically-motivated problems, ranging
from understanding the ways that pathogenic bacteria develop antibiotic resistance to the design of new
drugs that selectively bind and inhibit the functions of protein targets. The ongoing need for even greater
chemical insight has motivated my group’s effort to develop innovative mass spectrometry methods to
characterize structures of biological molecules in unprecedented detail, especially lipids and proteins
which are featured in this proposal. The overarching goal of my research program is to develop state-of-
the-art tandem mass spectrometry technologies, particularly highlighting ultraviolet photodissociation
(UVPD) and hybrid MS/MS methods, for structural elucidation of lipids, proteins, and protein complexes.
These new methods will be showcased for solving challenging problems in three areas. (1) Lipids: (i)
profiling lipids of pathogenic bacteria and their signatures of antibiotic resistance, and (ii) structural
characterization of unsaturations, oxidations and other modifications of lipids that occur during
remodeling of cellular membranes. (2) Protein complexes: (i) characterization of protein-ligand
complexes, membrane protein complexes, protein/nucleic acid complexes, and macromolecular
assemblies, and (ii) advancing capillary electrophoresis for native separations and exploration of the
interactome. (3) Post-translational modifications: focusing on decoding the phosphorylation patterns of
the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II which regulates transcription. These high impact problems
are supported via numerous collaborations with microbiology and molecular biology groups who
recognize the value of frontier mass spectrometry strategies for elevating biomedical research."
10762968,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
More than one in five adolescents will experience a mental health disorder, including depression and anxiety,
and the prevalence of these conditions is increasing. Among adolescents, depression and anxiety are linked to
increased risk of suicide, a leading cause of death in this age group. Identifying underlying and modifiable
contributors to these conditions is crucial as current research and interventions focus on screening and
treatment rather than prevention. Here, we posit that air pollution, in addition to genetic susceptibility, social
determinants, familial and school issues, and other factors, is a contributor to mental health disorders.
Toxicological studies demonstrate that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) are
neurotoxic, and epidemiologic studies consistently link these pollutants to reduced cognitive abilities and
increased externalizing behaviors. However, few studies have prospectively evaluated the role of air pollution
exposure on mental health disorders in childhood. Recently, we found that childhood air pollution exposure is
associated with increased risk for depression and anxiety at age 12 years. However, the role of air pollution in
the onset and persistence of mental health disorders during adolescence, and changes in brain structure,
organization, and function linked to these outcomes, remain poorly understood. Therefore, we hypothesize that
exposure to air pollution during critical periods of brain development, including adolescence, is associated with
adverse mental health outcomes. We will leverage existing longitudinal data from the Cincinnati Childhood
Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS) and the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment
(HOME) Study, two prospective cohorts located in Cincinnati, Ohio, to address this hypothesis. Both cohorts
have been followed from birth and evaluated with concordant measures of mental health and neuroimaging at
age 12 years. We will conduct new follow-up at age 18 years to assess the onset and persistence of mental
health outcomes through adolescence and apply validated models for PM2.5 and TRAP to characterize air
pollution exposure from conception through age 18 years. We will also acquire novel neuroimaging outcomes,
including brain -aminobutyric acid and glutathione concentrations accompanied by anatomical and functional
magnetic resonance imaging. Our aims are to: 1) determine the association between exposure to PM2.5 and
TRAP during distinct developmental periods and the onset and persistence of mental health outcomes in
adolescence; 2) determine the association between exposure to PM2.5 and TRAP during distinct developmental
periods and neuroimaging outcomes in late adolescence; and 3) determine whether changes in brain volume,
organization, metabolism, and function mediate associations between PM2.5 and TRAP exposure and mental
health outcomes. Examining air pollution as a novel and modifiable risk factor will provide critical data to guide
primary prevention aimed at reducing the burden of mental health disorders in adolescence."
10811575,"ABSTRACT. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with multiple risk factors including, obesity, low fiber diets,
and diets high in animal protein and saturated fat (SFat). African Americans (AAs) have a higher prevalence of
these risk factors and they have the highest incidence of CRC and related mortality. These multiple risk factors
are also linked to higher circulating and fecal bile acids (BA) and a shift in BA amino acid conjugation from glycine
to taurine. These BA-related changes can alter the composition, structure, and metabolic activity of the gut
microbiota, fostering conditions for gut bacteria to expand and metabolize taurine-conjugated BAs to genotoxic
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and the tumor promoter, deoxycholic acid (DCA); a colonic milieu conducive to the
formation of CRC. We have shown that the abundance of H2S-producing bacteria is significantly higher in the
colon of AAs compared to non-Hispanic whites and is a defining feature among AA CRC cases implicating these
bacteria as contributors to CRC development in a race-dependent manner. Moreover, the microbial difference
is associated with higher intake of SFat and animal protein in AAs, providing a pivotal intervention target. We
hypothesize that targeting the BA-gut microbiome axis to suppress abundance, growth and metabolic activity of
H2S and DCA producing bacteria through diet and weight loss (WL) may reduce CRC risk, especially among
AAs. A Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet), a largely plant-based dietary pattern, is relevant to CRC prevention and
microbial production of anti-cancer metabolites in observational studies. A MedDiet can shift BA metabolism as
shown in primates and when combined with calorie restriction, shows superior adherence and weight control in
humans, given its palatability. To date, no studies have tested in an RCT the effects of a MedDiet alone (Med-
A), WL through lifestyle intervention (WL-A) or a calorie-restricted MedDiet for WL (WL-Med) on the BA-gut
microbiome axis and its relevance to CRC prevention among AAs. Our multidisciplinary team combining
expertise in psychology, nutrition, microbiology, molecular cell biology, computational biology, medicine and
biostatistics, propose to conduct a four-arm RCT in which 200 obese AAs, 45-75 years old complete one of the
following 8-month interventions: Med-A, weight stable; WL-A, calorie restriction with no diet pattern change; WL-
Med; or Control. We will use samples and data collected at baseline, mid-study (month-4) and post-intervention
to compare the effects of the interventions on 1) Concentration and composition of circulating and fecal BAs; 2)
Gut microbiota and metabolic function; and 3) Gene expression profiles of exfoliated intestinal epithelial cells.
Our approach is strong given our multidisciplinary team, use of evidence-based lifestyle interventions, and
sophisticated –omics analyses to examine crosstalk between diet/WL, gut microbiome, and host intestinal
physiology. If successful, this study could have profound public health impact on CRC risk among AAs and other
high-risk populations, that would translate into timely dissemination opportunities."

The long-term objective of this research is to improve physical activity among populations experiencing cancer
disparities. The goal of this training award is to: (1) deliver a multicomponent, culturally-targeted, technology-
delivered, scalable intervention to increase physical activity among African American colorectal cancer
survivors; while advancing the development of a new investigator, with a program of research focused on
increasing physical activity and decreasing cancer disparities. Specific aims are to: (1) co-create, with AA CRC
survivors who engaged in physical activity throughout cancer treatment, culturally targeted narrative videos to
increase physical activity knowledge, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, habits and enjoyment; (2) pilot test
the intervention to assess reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance and; and (3)
measure outcomes at baseline, 3- and 9-months post baseline. Outcomes include: psychosocial constructs
related to physical activity engagement (knowledge, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, enjoyment, habits);
physical activity (average daily steps, weekly minutes of moderate-vigorous intensity activity); symptoms (pain,
fatigue, depression, bowel dysfunction); and inflammation biomarkers that may explain the pathways through
which physical activity impacts cancer outcomes. First, a qualitative exploratory approach will be used to
interview 20 African American colorectal cancer survivors. Together with a subset of interested participants a
multi-component intervention to increase physical activity among African American colorectal cancer survivors
will be created. Next, an additional 72 participants will be recruited to conduct a pilot two-group, randomized
repeated measures study to assess Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-
AIM) of the intervention. Feasibility of collecting survey and biomarker data at baseline, 3 and 9 months later
will be assessed. These timepoints will facilitate exploration of changes pre- and post-intervention, and to
determine if effects are maintained 6 months after completing the intervention and chemotherapy. Time since
last chemotherapy will be controlled for in all analyses to account for variations in treatment schedules."
10862539,"Down syndrome (DS), caused by triplication of human chromosome 21 (HSA21), is the most common genetic
origin of intellectual disability. Studying DS disease mechanism is challenging because functional human DS
brain tissues are scarcely available and transgenic mouse models of DS demonstrate incomplete/inaccurate
expression of HSA21 genes. The advent of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has led to
the generation of DS patient-derived hiPSCs, which presents an unprecedented opportunity for studying the
pathogenesis of DS with unlimited human brain cells in vitro. While using the hiPSC-based in vitro models, basic
aspects of the disease phenotypes can be examined, the disruption of neural circuits in the developing brain
under disease conditions remains to be studied with hiPSCs. Ultimately, specific developmental and disease
mechanisms can only be modeled in live animals to identify links between cellular phenotypes and behavioral
performance. Therefore, we propose to employ hiPSC-based chimeric mouse brain models to study the
neuropathophysiology of DS in vivo. Microglia play critical roles in brain development and are also an active
player in learning and memory processes. Surprisingly, very little information is available on how trisomy of
HSA21 alters the development and functions of microglia and what roles microglia play in the abnormal brain
development and cognitive deficits in DS. In addition, mounting evidence indicates that rodent microglia are not
able to fully mirror the properties of human microglia in normal and disease conditions. In this study, we will use
our recently created hiPSC microglial chimeric mouse model to unravel the role of microglia in DS pathogenesis
in an in vivo system with intact neural networks. We hypothesize that unlike engrafted normal human microglia,
engrafted diseased DS human microglia will show abnormal biological properties and functions, such as synaptic
pruning function in vivo. These abnormal properties of DS microglia will result in their negative regulation of the
synaptic activity and plasticity of the hippocampal neural network, critically contributing to the cognitive deficits
seen in DS. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. Aim 1: we will determine the differences between
DS and control hiPSC-derived microglia in vivo in human microglial chimeric mouse brains. Aim 2: Using the
microglial chimeric mouse model, we will further examine the impact of integration of DS microglia on synaptic
plasticity of the hippocampus and learning and memory behavior of the animals. Aim 3: We will normalize the
expression of the HSA21 genes by CRISPR/Cas9 to examine how this will alter the properties of DS microglia.
Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of hiPSC microglial chimeric mouse brains will be performed to
compare gene expression profiles of control and DS microglia. Findings from our study using a powerful, new
hiPSC microglial chimeric mouse model will provide novel insights into the pathological roles of human microglia
in DS. Identifying the potential molecules that can be targeted to improve microglial function may provide a new
therapeutic avenue for the treatment of DS."
10806936,"ABSTRACT
 People with HIV experience a much higher prevalence of depression and neurocognitive impairment (NCI)
than the general population, and these disorders frequently co-occur, reducing medication adherence and quality
of life and increasing mortality at least two-fold. Studies with large numbers of women as well as men are urgently
needed to elucidate the neurobiologic mechanisms underlying these disorders as well as recently identified sex
differences in vulnerability. Microglia-mediated neuro-inflammation and alterations in the Kynurenine Pathway
(KP), which is essential for maintaining balanced mono-amine neurotransmitter (e.g., dopamine and serotonin)
synthesis in the brain, are implicated in both disorders. Iron, dysregulated by HIV and combination antiretroviral
therapy (cART), is intimately involved in microglial activation, the KP, and neurotransmitter metabolism. Our
preliminary studies in a single neuro-HIV cohort and in HIV(-) persons indicate a significant role for dysregulated
iron metabolism and iron-related gene networks in depression and NCI, as well as sex-specific effects. The
proposed study leverages existing clinical, iron-biomarker, and genome-wide datasets from three large
prospective HIV cohort studies to powerfully and comprehensively interrogate the role of iron in depression and
NCI in both sexes. A combination of serum and cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) biomarker, iron-centered genome-wide
associations, and network bioinformatics approaches will be employed. Central hypotheses of this proposal are
that iron dysregulation, and iron-related genes/networks, are major contributors to depression and NCI in PWH,
with variability in overall risk explained in part by age, sex, HIV, and cART effects on iron. The Specific Aims are:
1) Determine the role of altered iron homeostasis in depression and NCI in PWH across the age spectrum and
the proportion of susceptibility that is attributable to the effects of biologic factors, HIV, and cART on iron; 2)
Identify novel iron-dependent pathways, iron-metabolic genes, and iron-quantitative trait loci associated with
depression and NCI in women and men with HIV, and determine the extent to which these genetic effects are
mediated via iron; 3) Explore the functional impact of network-prioritized iron-related gene knockdown on
production of KP metabolites, using an in vitro HIV(+/-) human microglia model. In addition, Aim 1 will associate
iron indices in a subset of individuals to CSF mono-amine metabolites. We expect these studies to advance
understanding of mechanisms leading to depression and NCI in people with HIV, suggesting novel precision-
medicine approaches to disease management and potentially impactful, iron- or KP-modulating interventions."

10760216,"The lymphatic vascular system plays an essential role in the transport of interstitial fluid and lipids,
and in the induction of adaptive immune responses in vertebrates. Normal functioning of the lymphatic
vascular system depends upon intraluminal lymphatic valves (LV) that facilitate propulsive flow of
lymph fluid in collecting lymphatic vessels. Defects in LV development and function results in accumu-
lation of lymph in tissues or body cavities resulting in lymphedema, chylothorax and chylous ascites.
From a medical perspective, understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate the development
and function of LV is critical, yet our knowledge of these mechanisms remains limited. We have re-
ported previously that RASA1, which inhibits activation of the intracellular Ras signal transduction
pathway, is required for the development and maintenance of LV. In addition, others have reported
that the receptor tyrosine kinase, EPHB4, is required for LV development. However, the precise mo-
lecular mechanisms by which RASA1 and EPHB4 regulate LV are unknown. A long-term goal of the
King laboratory is to understand the role of the Ras signaling pathway in different physiological sys-
tems in health and disease. The overall objective of this application, which is consistent with this long-
term goal, is to understand how RASA1 regulates the development and function of LV. Our central
hypothesis is that RASA1, through physical interaction with EPHB4, promotes the export of collagen
IV from LV-forming (LVF) lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) and mature LEC for deposition in the ex-
tracellular matrix core of developing and established LV leaflets respectively. The rationale for these
studies is that they will inform upon the molecular mechanisms by which RASA1 and EPHB4 regulate
the development and function of LV. We plan to test our central hypothesis and, thereby, attain the
objective of this application by pursuing the following two specific aims: In the first aim, we will use
different molecular cell biologic, mouse genetic, and physiological approaches to understand the mo-
lecular mechanism by which RASA1 loss results in failed development and maintenance of LV. In the
second aim, we will use similar approaches to understand the role of EPHB4 in the development of
LV and the mechanisms involved. The proposed studies are innovative because of the novel method-
ologies employed and the concept that an EPHB4-RASA1 axis is essential for the development and
function of LV acting to export collagen IV from LVF LEC and LV LEC. The studies are significant be-
cause of their potential to lead to new therapies for the prevention and treatment of LV abnormalities
in humans with inherited mutations in RASA1 and EPHB4 genes."

The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) has been increasing over the past
few decades and is projected to double by 2025 and triple by 2050. AD is still incurable, and causes of ADRD
remain largely unknown, but they have been linked to many risk factors, including age, education, history of
psychiatric disorders, head trauma, and vascular diseases or related risk factors. More recently, antihypertensive
and antidiabetic drug therapies have been associated with a lower risk of developing dementia and early
cognitive impairment. In 2019, a large clinical trial reported that intensive blood pressure control significantly
reduced the risk of mild cognitive impairment and was the first trial to demonstrate an effective strategy for the
prevention of age-related cognitive impairment. Given a high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the
adult population, the utilization of disease-modifying drugs may provide an effective strategy for the prevention
of ADRD. However, there is no large cohort study monitoring and assessing the joint effects of antihypertensive,
antidiabetic, and anticancer medications on the risk of ADRD. Medicare, which has covered a large population
aged 65 or older in the U.S. since 1965 with comprehensive and well-documented electronic databases available
since 1991 (including anticancer chemotherapy), provides a great opportunity and resource to monitor the
prevalence and incidence of ADRD over time. In addition, since Medicare Part-D comprehensive drug coverage
was implemented in 2006, it is possible to determine the impact of antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs on
the risk of these dementias. Hence, the primary goal of this proposed study is to test the hypothesis that
anticancer, antihypertensive and antidiabetic drug therapies have impacted the prevalence and incidence of
ADRD over the past 30 years. To accomplish this, we propose to address the following Specific Aims: 1) to
determine the secular trends in the prevalence of ADRD from 1991 to 2020 among Medicare beneficiaries aged
65 or older in the United States and variations in the prevalence of ADRD by state, geographic region, age,
gender, race/ethnicity, and comorbidity; 2) to determine the incidence of developing ADRD in association with
vascular factors and other potential risk factors among Medicare beneficiaries who were free of dementia at
baseline and followed for up to 30 years; 3) to determine the association between a cancer diagnosis and
anticancer drug therapies and the risk of developing ADRD by comparing a large cohort of patients diagnosed
with major cancers to those with similar background risks but without cancer in 1991-2020; and 4) to determine
the independent and joint effects of antihypertensive, antidiabetic and anticancer drug therapies on the risk of
developing ADRD among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older in 2007-2020 after Medicare Part-D
comprehensive drug data became available. The findings from this study will have significant implications for
preventing or delaying the onset of ADRD and hence will make substantial contributions to the primary research
goal of the National Alzheimer’s Project Act by 2025."
10771214,"ABSTRACT
Mammographic density, which describes the proportions of epithelial and stromal vs. adipose tissue in the breast,
is a strong risk factor for breast cancer. Many of known breast cancer risk factors are also associated with
mammographic density, suggesting that mammographic density is an important intermediate phenotype to study.
Indeed, as a continuous and more precise outcome associated with all breast cancer subtypes, mammographic
density has proven an important surrogate marker for breast cancer, and it has been argued that mammographic
density is a more meaningful biological outcome to study.
 Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cancer-related cause of death among Hispanic
women living in the US. A recent study estimated that among Hispanic women, breast density accounted for
35% of premenopausal and 13% of postmenopausal breast cancers. Yet, an overwhelming majority of
mammographic density research to date has been conducted among non-Hispanic Whites, leaving a substantial
gap in our understanding of mammographic density and its determinants across racial/ethnic groups.
 We propose to conduct the largest epidemiological study of mammographic density among Hispanic
women living in the US to date. We will first establish a repository of 3,200 mammograms within the multi-site
US Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) cohort and obtain estimates of dense area,
non-dense area and percent density phenotypes (Aim 1). We will then assess if sociocultural, reproductive and
adiposity-related factors are associated with mammographic density phenotypes in a total sample size of 6,347
US Hispanic women (Aim 2), leveraging rich lifestyle and genetic data in HCHS/SOL together with already
existing mammographic density, lifestyle and genetic data from the Mountain Park Health Center (MPHC)
Mammography and Latinas LEarning About Density (LLEAD) studies, which include 3,147 US Hispanic women.
Finally, we will conduct genetic association studies of mammographic density phenotypes, including genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) in 3,300 women for whom we have GWAS and mammographic density data.
Novel loci will be replicated in an independent population of 2,000 Hispanic women, and assessed for their
association with breast cancer risk in a Hispanic GWAS of 4,500 cases and 9,000 controls (Aim 3).
 HCHS/SOL represents multiple Hispanic background groups (Dominican, Central American, Cuban,
Mexican, Puerto Rican, South American), reflecting the diversity of Hispanics living in the US. Our mammogram
repository will constitute the largest, most comprehensive collection of mammograms in a Hispanic population
with already collected rich lifestyle and genetic data. Numerous future projects would build on this one-of-a-kind
resource including collection of longitudinal mammograms to study change in density with time. With the growing
number of Hispanics living in the US, we need to expand our epidemiological research into risk factors of
common diseases, such as breast cancer, to achieve equal care across racial/ethnic groups."
10749873,"Project Summary: This project proposes to study the role of Smad8 and muscle-enriched microRNAs, known
as myomiRs, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a skeletal muscle wasting
disease that is at least in part mediated by secondary effects from membrane fragility due to loss of dystrophin.
These secondary effects include impairments in muscle proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration that are
propagated by inflammation. This project has identified the TGF-associated transcription factor, Smad8, as
markedly elevated and associated with the repression of myomiRs in Duchenne muscular dystrophy skeletal
muscles. As such, the proposal will use cell culture and mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy to
molecularly map the role of Smad8 in skeletal muscle function and disease.
The short-term goal is to identify the mechanisms by which TGF / Smad8 signaling might promote dystrophic
processes by understanding its connection to myomiRs repression with a goal of identifying novel pathways for
potential therapeutic intervention. For example, we will study the effects of over-expression and knockdown of
Smad8 on key pathways like muscle proliferation, differentiation, and skeletal muscle regeneration. We will also
study impact of Smad8 modulation on myomiRs and their downstream mRNA pathways. The long-term goal is
to expand our understanding of TGF / Smad8 cell signaling and microRNA biology in skeletal muscle function
in health and disease."

Title:
Diagnosing the undiagnosable: studies of Alzheimer disease mimics and confounders via ""neuropathometry"" of
dissection photos with 3D scanning
Summary:
While most patients with late life dementia have Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there are conditions that overlap or
even mimic AD, confounding clinical diagnosis, and thus representing a barrier to accurate predictions of rate
of progression and to effective therapeutics. Examples of these diseases include concomitant TDP-43
pathology, Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and microvascular lesions associated with poorly defined white
matter lesions. A critical barrier to studying these diseases is that there currently is no reliable premortem
biomarker. Here we propose a collaboration with two Alzheimer’s Research Centers to evaluate anatomical
signatures of these three conditions, in contrast to AD, in order to enable research into them, and ultimately
port back to MRI in order to directly enhance clinical care.
 Specifically, we propose to use advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to perform volumetric
photographic scanning post mortem (at autopsy), on patients seen at the Massachusetts Alzheimer Disease
Research Center (MADRC). Reconstructing imaging volumes from dissection photographs, which are routinely
acquired at brain banks and neuropathology departments, will enable us to correlate neuropathology with
macroscopic measurements (e.g., volume and shape of brain structures, cortical thickness) without the need
for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. This is crucial because diagnostic MRI is not always acquired
close to autopsy, or at all, and ex vivo MRI is expensive, technically challenging, and not available at many
research sites. Therefore, our technique has the potential of greatly increasing sample sizes, especially with
asymptomatic individuals who were not scanned in life, and who would likely manifest the earliest and purest
neuropathological changes.
 Our tools will combine ML with 3D shape scanning, which is an increasingly inexpensive technology ($1,000
- $10,000 for a scanner), to produce very accurate reconstructions of the brain shape. Moreover, we will also
build an “atlas” version of the tool, that replaces 3D scanning by a probabilistic atlas, thus enabling analysis of
retrospective data. We will develop the tools in collaboration with a second ADRC, the University of
Washington ADRC, which has slice photographs for approximately one thousand cases.
 The new tools will be used to closely study a prospective cohort at MADRC, consisting of 200 subjects. We
seek to identify neuroimaging signatures of the AD mimics mentioned above, which can be ported to in vivo
MRI scanning. Moreover, we will also distribute and maintain the tools as part of our neuroimaging package
FreeSurfer (over 40,000 worldwide licenses), so they can be used by research sites around the world to
augment neuropathology with macroscopic morphometric measures at little or no cost."
10764930,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is recognized as the most common movement disorder. The cardinal symptoms
of PD are caused by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in substantia nigra pars
compacta (SNpc) and accompanying striatal pathology. Mutations in LRRK2 are known to be the most
common genetic causes of PD. Given its strong genetic links and compelling drug ability, LRRK2 represents a
clear target for therapeutic development. However, the mechanisms that regulate LRRK2 function remain
unclear. Moreover, LRRK2 regulation in striatal pathology and striatal-dependent behaviors remains largely
elusive despite high expression of LRRK2 in the striatum. The LRRK2 protein includes two important
enzymatic domains: a ROC (Ras of Complex) GTPase domain and a kinase domain. Disease causing
mutations are found in both GTPase and kinase domains, indicating the importance of both GTPase and
kinase activities of LRRK2. To date studies have focused largely on the kinase activity of LRRK2 while
attention on the GTPase domain is limited. LRRK2 is a guanine nucleotide-binding protein, but the mechanism
of direct regulation of its GTPase domain is unclear. Conventional guanine nucleotide-binding proteins are
typically regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs).
Some guanine nucleotide-binding proteins can be activated by nucleotide-dependent dimerization (GAD).
Whether LRRK2 is regulated by GAPs and GEFs or by GAD has been actively investigated. We have
previously identified the first GAP ArfGAP1 for LRRK2 in vitro and in vivo. Recently we discovered a potential
physiological GEF for LRRK2. It has similar expression patterns with LRRK2 in nigrostriatal pathway, interacts
with LRRK2 and regulates LRRK2 neurotoxicity. Based on the preliminary observations, our central hypothesis
is that this GEF serves as a physiological GEF for LRRK2 to increase LRRK2 GTP binding activity, regulate
LRRK2 cellular function and LRRK2-induced striatal pathology and related behavioral deficits. The objective of
this study is (1) to identify and characterize the first physiological GEF for LRRK2, (2) to determine how this
GEF regulates LRRK2 function, and (3) to explore the regulation of this GEF on LRRK2 in striatal pathology
and related behavior. Accomplishment of this study will lead to understanding how the GTPase function of
LRRK2 is regulated and to determining whether this regulation affects the actions of LRRK2 in striatum. The
LRRK2 GTPase, GAP or GEF activities would be served as new therapeutic targets, which is distinct from
direct kinase inhibition of LRRK2. New knowledge regarding this aspect of LRRK2 biology will advance our
understanding of the physiologic and pathophysiologic actions of LRRK2 as well as potential identification of
novel targets for future pharmacologic intervention."

Age-related hearing loss is a ubiquitous problem, estimated to affect up to one third of the population. This condition is much more detrimental than ‘hard of hearing’, rather, it has been implicated in a host of co-morbidities such as cognitive deficits, and other mental illness. It remains unclear if this is a cause and effect situation or an epiphenomenon. If the former, simple interventions may well lead to much better mental health among the elderly. The long-term goal of the proposed research program is to identify the neural coding principles that allow listeners to make sense of, and focus on, particular sounds (i.e. what you are listening to) when they occur mixed with other sounds (i.e. the background), something that is common in many listening situations. Although this is an extremely difficult computational problem, people with normal hearing solve it effortlessly. Unfortunately, this remarkable ability almost always declines with age, leaving individuals struggling to understand speech in noisy environments. In order to develop assistive technologies or therapies to restore this critical function, we need to understand how the brain processes sounds in complex acoustic scenes, and, in particular, exactly how it fails to do so in aged individuals. Age-related shifts in the coding strategy employed at different stages of the auditory pathway are believed to involve compensatory changes related to attenuated input from more peripheral stages, and recent research in older animals has demonstrated quantitative and qualitative changes in central neural representation of complex sounds. Crucially, these changes appear to involve changes in how information is transformed along the cortical hierarchy. For this reason, a rigorous study of the effects of age-related hearing loss must include a comparison of cortical areas, such as core versus belt, that function at different levels of the processing hierarchy in normal hearing. Moreover, these central changes impact not only ‘bottom-up’ sound processing along the ascending auditory pathway, but also ‘top-down’ modulation by attention. The proposed studies will therefore contrast how complex sounds in challenging listening environments are processed in young versus old animals while those animals are performing perceptual tasks that either do or do not require auditory attention. These studies will be the first to track changes in how multiple complex sounds are encoded across hierarchical levels of processing in the auditory pathway in a primate model of aging, while allowing direct comparisons between cortical response changes and auditory perceptual deficits."

The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding
bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables
widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by
the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome
of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest.
Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiﬁca-
tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls
can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods
for identiﬁcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding,
incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth-
ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies
using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine
effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety
using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with
paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators
to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiﬁc research."
10745292,"Glioblastomas rank among the most lethal of all human cancers. Current therapy includes maximal surgical
resection, followed by combined radiotherapy and oral chemotherapy (temozolomide), and adjuvant
temozolomide. Maximal current therapy offers only palliation. Median survival for glioblastoma patients has
been reported to be 15-21 months, but these data are derived from patients with favorable age and
performance status. Recurrent glioblastoma therapy is limited with little evidence for effective therapy.
Treatment failure is derived from numerous causes, including the presence of stem-like tumor cells, called
glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs contribute to radioresistance, chemoresistance, invasion, immune
escape, and angiogenesis. GSCs display dependencies on specific signal transduction pathways and
epigenetic regulation, associated with metabolic reprogramming.
Almost all living organisms on earth are exposed to a regular 24-hour day-night cycles generated by planet’s
rotation around its own axis, which in return leads to the evolution of intrinsic, entrainable circadian rhythm
driven by cell autonomous biological clocks. Molecular oscillation of transcriptional circuitry to regulate
circadian rhythms include positive regulation by the BMAL1 and CLOCK transcription factors, with two
negative regulatory loops that either transcriptionally downregulate BMAL1 or bind and inhibit
BMAL1:CLOCK transcriptional complexes. In our proposed studies, we leverage preliminary findings that the
circadian rhythm machinery serves distinct cellular and molecular roles in maintenance of GSCs. We will
determine the necessity for circadian rhythm regulation in GSCs mediate through metabolic reprogramming
and selective activation of oncogenic pathways.
To translate these efforts into novel clinical paradigms, we are using a novel class of agents that target
circadian clock function. These small molecule inhibitors are brain penetrant and can be combined with other
therapies to create synergistic targeting of GSCs. To generate the most effective therapeutic paradigm, we
will interrogate the preclinical utility of novel targeted therapies that disrupt the circadian rhythm oscillatory
loop that could accentuate the efficacy of conventional therapy. Collectively, the proposed studies will lay
the foundation for improved understanding of circadian rhythm regulation in cancer stem cell biology with
possible application to improved oncologic care."

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a critically important technique in biomedical research
with a unique ability to detect naturally occurring or engineered unpaired electrons in complex biological
environments. EPR has wide-ranging applicability to structural biology, metalloprotein research, redox biology,
rational drug design, and clinical diagnostics. Groundbreaking advancements in sample volume requirements
for biomedical EPR spectroscopy applications were made nearly four decades ago with the development of the
loop-gap resonator (LGR), which represented breakthrough benefits such as 10-fold lower sample volume
requirements and higher resonator efficiencies to increase signals over the commonly used cavity resonator. To
accommodate the biomedical needs of even further increased signal intensity and to provide the broader
scientific community with accessible technology, we propose to capitalize on our recent development of the
dielectric LGR (dLGR) concept and optimize this resonator technology to increase sensitivity beyond that
achieved upon introduction of the LGR. A dLGR is effectively a small dielectric resonator placed inside the inner
loop of an LGR where the return flux of the dielectric flows through the outer loops of the LGR. Analytic theory
and our high-frequency structure simulations indicate that the dLGR enables an order-of-magnitude
improvement in sensitivity over the LGR. To take full advantage of the extremely low volume requirements for
the dLGR, we propose to develop efficient sample handling technologies that couple the dLGR to high-
throughput sample handling instrumentation. We aim to develop two transformative technologies for biomedical
EPR applications: i) a nano-dLGR with a 10-fold increase in sensitivity for ~0.2 µL sample volumes integrated
with a customized autosampler and ii) a micro-dLGR for a dramatic increase in sensitivity for ~2 µL sample
volumes with an optimized stopped-flow system for millisecond time scale kinetics measurements. These
transformative and innovative prototypes with outstanding sensitivity will be easy to use and ultimately widely
available to the scientific community. Where the LGR was a transformative advance compared with cavity
resonators, the dLGR is expected to be another transformative leap from an LGR."
10747451,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic,
progressive, inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract that affect up to 3 million Americans. IBD is
thought to be driven by inappropriate immune responses to an altered gut microbiome, or dysbiosis, with a
disease course characterized by remitting and relapsing episodes of inflammation, or flares. Despite increasing
knowledge regarding the relationship between the gut microbiome, dysbiosis, and the impact on mucosal
immunity, much remains unknown regarding the inciting environmental factors and underlying mechanisms
that result in intestinal inflammation. In addition, although there have been dramatic improvements in IBD
therapeutics, the disease course has remained relatively unchanged with patients remaining at high risk for
recurrent flares, complications, surgeries, and reduced quality of life. Enteric infections are a common cause of
dysbiosis, and have been implicated as an environmental factor in onset and flare of IBD. Our preliminary data
has identified enteric infection in nearly 30% of IBD flares, with the most common pathogens including
Clostridioides difficile, Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), and norovirus. This K23 proposal will
address this knowledge gap by testing the hypothesis that enteric infection is a major environmental factor in
flare of IBD, producing a specific subtype of flare characterized by a unique clinical presentation and impact on
IBD progression, distinct from patients with a flare but without an enteric infection. To test this hypothesis, we
will recruit and prospectively follow patients with flare of IBD with the presence of C. difficile, EPEC, or
norovirus, and separately with flare of IBD but without a gastrointestinal pathogen. We will identify the clinical
(Aim 1), gut microbiome, and immune factors (Aim 2) that distinguish flares complicated by enteric infection to
directly improve IBD outcomes in these patients. This will be the first study to longitudinally determine the
clinical and molecular impact of specific enteric pathogens on the course of IBD with the potential to reveal
innovative mechanisms regarding the role of enteric pathogens as environmental factors in IBD, and novel
approaches to the management of this complex clinical scenario. To conduct this research, further training is
required, and Dr. Axelrad has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors to provide detailed training in
immunology and microbiology, biostatistics and quantitative methods, and funding and grantsmanship. This
K23 proposal will position Dr. Axelrad to accomplish the goal of determining the role of specific enteric
pathogens in flares of IBD and facilitate his development into an independent, patient-oriented and
translational investigator in the field of IBD."

 Agreement studies, used in the evaluation of newly-developed biomarkers and diagnostic tests, depend
upon statistical methods proposed nearly 50 years ago. As Alzheimer’s disease has entered into an era where
neuroimaging biomarkers are incorporated into the diagnostic strategy, the progression of our statistical
methods must match that of our medical growth. These statistical methods contain significant flaws, such as
depending on sample disease prevalence, having complex interpretations, imposing restrictive experimental
designs and failing to account for risk factors. The current proposal seeks to advance the statistical methods
used in the development of biomarkers and diagnostics, and, in doing so, will identify characteristics important
for diagnosing and predicting Alzheimer’s disease status.
 We hypothesize that our novel statistical contributions will correct these flaws in our approach to biomarker
and diagnostic test development. It will allow for a more informative, interpretable and robust way to quantify
the agreement and accuracy of medical tests. For our first aim, we will develop a novel statistical methodology
to quantify agreement, centering our framework on mixed effect models. We will compare our approach with
traditional methods among providers evaluating neuroimaging biomarkers. We will leverage data from the NIA-
funded R01 Alzheimer’s Prevention through Exercise (APEx) study and enhance it with primary data collection
of neuroimaging interpretations by a diverse sample of providers. For our second aim, we will determine how
the sampling design of contemporary agreement studies influence predictive accuracy. Simulation “in-silico”
studies will be performed, reproducing many scenarios present in the literature. Additionally, data from the
Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) will be leveraged and measures informing accuracy, such
as sensitivity and specificity, will be calculated. We will do so under traditional approaches and our novel
statistical framework, demonstrating that current methods are merely a special case of our more robust model.
This will highlight limitations of current approaches.
 The broad, long term objectives of this proposal are two-fold. First, we aim to develop a robust and
generalized statistical method for evaluating agreement and accuracy of biomarkers and diagnostic tests. By
using mixed effects models and corresponding sampling designs, we will overcome flaws present in traditional
approaches and gain advantages, such as easily interpreted measures and generalizable results. The second
objective is to facilitate a rigorous training plan that will provide a foundation for my future career as a
physician-statistician who focuses on biomarker methodology. While the combination of these objectives aligns
with the purpose of my current MD-PhD program and this NIH Pre-doctoral Training F30 award, the statistical
advancements are applicable to any medical condition, and thus are poised to have a strong impact on
biomedical science."
10839805,"Vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) are ultimately responsible for the majority of morbidity and mortality in sickle cell
disease (SCD). The initiation of VOC is not fully understood. For RBCs with sickle hemoglobin (HbS),
deoxygenation induces polymerization, reducing cellular mechanical deformability, among other biophysical
changes, and increasing VOC risk. By utilizing a recently developed interferometric phase and amplitude
microscopy (iPAM) technique, we found a subpopulation of “unfit” RBCs in the blood of SCD patients with altered
material properties including shape and viscosity. In a parallel study using a novel microfluidic assay for sickling
kinetics (MASK), we found that cellular defects appear to accumulate after either repeated sickling or mechanical
stress cycles, resulting in faster sickling, reduced deformability, and significant shape changes in sickle cells.
These observations suggest an overarching hypothesis that mechanical fatigue of sickle RBCs by repeated
sickling or mechanical loading in circulation causes “defects” to accumulate, producing an “unfit” subpopulation
of RBCs that is responsible for VOC initiation. This subpopulation of “unfit” RBCs can be distinguished by iPAM.
This proposal will examine this hypothesis by designing a next-generation iPAM platform integrated with MASK,
elucidating how repeated mechanical stress affects sickle RBC properties and influences VOC propensity. We
have assembled a team of investigators with relevant expertise to tackle this problem. These include Dr. So who
is an expert in bioimaging, Dr. Dao who is an expert in microfluidics and biomechanics, and Dr. Higgins who is
an expert in sickle cell disease pathophysiology. This team of investigators has worked together for over five
years with several joint publications. The work in this proposal is divided into four aims. Aim 1 focuses on
developing an extinction-based iPAM that will allow quantification of sickle RBC rheology in addition to fitness
index. The RBCs from sickle patients will be studied in a novel microfluidic platform that will enable amplitude-
modulated electrodeformation as well as repeated deoxygenation-oxygenation cycles for the cells under study.
These technological innovations will allow us to evaluate whether unfit RBCs are mechanically compromised
due to the accumulation of mechanical defects and whether these unfit cells sickle faster upon deoxygenation.
In Aim 2, we will add the ability to measure both oxy- and deoxy-Hb concentration in iPAM, allowing us to explore
whether mechanical cycling affects oxygen transport through the RBC membrane and its effect on HbS
polymerization. In Aim 3, polarization-resolved capability will be added to iPAM enabling us to detect whether
remnant polymerized HbS may persist inside unfit cells in the normoxic state acting as nuclei to promote
polymerization. We will evaluate this possibility as a complementary mechanism beside accumulated membrane
defects to explain why unfit cells may sickle faster. Finally, Aim 4 will correlate baseline patient clinical outcome
with the level of unfit cells. In this aim, we will further evaluate the effect of hydroxyurea and voxelotor treatment
on unfit cell fraction in SCD patients."

The objectives of this proposal are to determine the mechanisms of photoreceptor protein
compartmentalization. Retinal photoreceptors are polarized neurons whose major functions,
include receiving and transmitting signals, are compartmentalized into discrete subcellular
domains. Compartmentalization is critical for normal photoreceptor activity and reduced vision or
blindness result from improper segregation of proteins. Despite their importance, the mechanisms
underlying protein compartmentalization in photoreceptors, or any other neuron, remain poorly
understood. Essential for understanding compartmentalization are the biophysical properties of
the photoreceptor cytoplasm, the biophysical properties of the proteins that are destined to be
compartmentalized and the forces that drive accumulation of proteins, against significant
concentration gradients, into the specific compartments. We have uncovered a fundamental
biophysical mechanism that may be central to protein transport and segregation in all electrically
active cells: transport of charged proteins within the electrical field generated by the photoreceptor
neuronal activity. We call this novel mechanism axial dynamic electrophoretic protein
transport (ADEPT). We will use state of the art live cell fluorescence imaging tools developed in
our lab, powerful transgenic and gene editing techniques in Xenopus, and sophisticated
biochemical and cell biological approaches to address the following aims:
Aim 1: Map the axial cytoplasmic electric field, Eax, in rod photoreceptors.
Aim 2: Determine the impact of ADEPT on photoreceptor protein transport and
compartmentalization in living photoreceptors.
Aim 3: Determine the locations and influence of Arrestin interactions on their distributions
and dynamics in living rods and cones."

The intrahepatic biliary tree functions to drain bile from hepatocytic canaliculi away from the liver. Congenital or
acquired abnormalities in the formation and patency of intrahepatic bile ducts have severe, often fatal
consequences. In the developing liver, biliary morphogenesis is a self-organizing process whereby bipotential
hepatoblasts simultaneously adopt a biliary fate and organize into a continuous tubular network without cell
division. Mounting evidence suggests that transdifferentiation of mature hepatocytes can also yield both normal
regenerative biliary morphogenesis and abnormal disease-associated biliary `ductal reactions' in the adult liver.
The mechanisms by which biliary architecture and fate are coordinated to enact this dramatic morphogenetic
program and build a functional biliary tree are largely unknown. Understanding the mechanistic basis of biliary
morphogenesis is necessary to harness the regenerative potential of the liver while avoiding the lethal
consequences of chronic and malignant liver disease. We recently discovered that de novo lumen formation
and expansion initiates biliary morphogenesis and is central to the coordination of biliary architecture and fate.
Our published and preliminary studies suggest a model wherein lumen formation creates a physical signaling
niche that feeds back to reinforce both biliary architecture and fate, thereby creating the biliary system from the
inside out. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how lumen formation and extension guides the
formation of the biliary tubular network. The successful completion of this work will address a key gap in our
understanding of how to safely build this critical organ, and limit or repair it in disease."

 Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are drugs that inhibit estrogen synthesis and that are prescribed to prevent
the recurrence of estrogen responsive breast cancers. However, AIs, such as the commonly prescribed Letrozole
(LET), are associated with severe side-effects that further burden the quality of life, including insomnia, hot
flashes, depressive symptoms and cognitive deficits. The precise mechanisms by which AIs may give rise to
these CNS symptoms remain unclear and difficult to study in humans, as control for individual differences in
disease severity, treatment history and experienced stress is lacking. Furthermore, AI treatment is recommended
for 3 to 5 years, yet little is known about the effects of long-term AI use on the brain and behavior, especially
with regards to age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. We propose to develop a primate
model for AI-induced CNS effects to advance our knowledge in this area and facilitate the design of novel
therapeutics.
 This application uses the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small primate with a brain architecture, sleep
patterns, cognitive abilities, emotional responses and thermoregulation patterns that are comparable to those of
humans (1) to study the effects of chronic LET use on the brain and behavior and (2) to test whether DHED, a
prodrug that delivers E2 selectively to the brain, can effectively and safely prevent LET-associated adverse
effects.
 To achieve these aims, middle-aged male and female marmosets treated with LET, LET + DHED or
Vehicle for 3 years will be studied longitudinally for changes in sleep/wake patterns, cognitive performance,
emotional regulation, and thermoregulation. The monkeys will be outfitted with an activity monitor for sleep/wake
patterns analysis. Cognitive function will be assessed via an automated computerized battery. Thermal imaging
will be used to measure changes in facial skin temperature during a thermal challenge. Emotional regulation will
be assessed by measuring heart rate variability and facial skin temperature in monkeys viewing emotional and
neutral videos. Following these in vivo behavioral assessments, analyses of brain tissues from underlying brain
regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, locus coeruleus) will be carried out to quantify gene
expression of selected genes, tauopathies, β-amyloid deposition and neuronal excitability.
 The results will have important translational applications for AI-treated patients by (1) characterizing the
effects of AIs on multiple neural and behavioral outcomes; (2) determining whether long-term estrogen
suppression promotes the development of an AD-like phenotype and (3) whether providing the brain with an
alternate source of estrogen can counteract the adverse effects of AIs on the brain and behavior."
10754234,"Our data indicate that in select settings activation of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase)/ceramide signaling in
tumor endothelial cells by radiation and certain chemotherapies synergizes with direct tumor cell damage to
impact outcome. ASMase is a lysosomal hydrolase preferentially expressed in endothelial cells up to 20-fold
compared with other mammalian cells. Mechanistically, endothelial ASMase activation leads within min to
formation of plasma membrane ceramide-rich platforms (CRPs), macrodomains that organize apoptotic signaling
programs. Support for our concept derives from studies showing xenografts of all histologies, when implanted in
asmase-/- host mice become resistant to gemcitabine, paclitaxel, etoposide, and high single dose radiotherapy,
effects reversed by exclusive adenoviral asmase gene delivery to tumor microvasculature. We recently
discovered VEGF is the principal inhibitor of endothelial ASMase, and that anti-angiogenic drugs de-repress
ASMase, amplifying tumor responses to anti-cancer therapies, but only under specific conditions. We found
irrespective of t1/2 or anti-angiogenic class, these drugs enhance endothelial apoptosis and tumor response only
if scheduled at 1-2h preceding chemotherapy, as ASMase can be de-repressed for only 1-2h. Based on these
data, the MSK Sarcoma Service performed a Phase II trial that showed sphingolipid-based timing of
bevacizumab vs. conventional synchronous timing improved metastatic sarcoma response to the cytidine
analogue gemcitabine from 38 to 93% (p=0.0024; Tap and Kolesnick, unpublished). The current application will
help establish the mechanism by which temporal delivery of a short-acting anti-angiogenic drug simultaneously
enhances gemcitabine-induced endothelial and tumor cell apoptosis. The overarching hypothesis of this
application is that the principal nucleoside transporter in mammalian cells, ENT1, required for gemcitabine
uptake, is not constitutively “on” as generally accepted but must insert into CRPs on endothelial and tumor cells
for functionalization. This new membrane-based mechanism of gemcitabine action will be explored in 3 aims
designed to examine mechanism of ENT1 functionalization via CRPs in both endothelial and sarcoma cells,
VEGF inhibition of ASMase-generated CRPs, and pharmacologic strategies to enhance endothelial ASMase-
ceramide signaling in vivo to improve ENT1-mediated gemcitabine uptake and cell death. A major concept to be
explored is that gemcitabine-induced ASMase secreted by endothelium triggers “bystander” gemcitabine uptake
via ENT1 in tumor cells. As such, these investigations potentially define failure to stimulate ASMase/ceramide
signaling as mediating a new form of chemoresistance. It is anticipated that information derived from studies
proposed here will inform a planned follow up clinical trial for advanced sarcoma to be performed by the Sarcoma
Service at MSK."

During transcription, the nascent RNA can anneal with the template DNA strand behind the advancing RNA
polymerase and cause the formation of alternative DNA structures called R-loops. R-loop profiling studies have
revealed that these structures are prevalent in all genomes and form normally and dynamically. Under normal
conditions, R-loops serve important physiological roles. Yet, over the last decade, harmful R-loops that arise
when transcription is perturbed have been implicated as powerful triggers of genome instability from yeast to
humans. Harmful R-loops have also been linked to an increasing number of human disorders. What
distinguishes “good” R-loops from “harmful” R-loops remains mostly unknown. In this proposal, we aim to
dissect the mechanisms linking perturbed transcription, R-loop metabolism, and genome instability. This will be
accomplished by addressing three central questions. (1) What defines harmful R-loops? While harmful R-loops
have been proposed in many studies, they have never been directly defined at the genomic level. We will
leverage our unique expertise in R-loop profiling to characterize these proposed structures in the context of
well-defined human cellular models of RNA processing dysfunction. This work will define the diversity of
altered R-loop landscapes that result from defects in RNA splicing, termination, and export and will allow us to
identify how perturbed transcription results in altered R-loop distributions, boosting our knowledge of R-loop
biogenesis pathways. (2) Does genome instability result from harmful R-loops or from altered transcription
itself? While attention has been focused on harmful R-loops, the negative impacts of defective RNA processing
on transcription itself have seldom been considered. To disentangle possible R-loop effects from pure
transcriptional effects, we will carefully monitor transcriptional perturbations in cellular models of RNA
processing dysfunction. In addition, we will directly measure the accumulation of DNA damage markers in
relation to R-loops, allowing us to determine for the first time if altered R-loops are actually “harmful” or if they
simply reflect abnormal transcription. (3) What is the role of Ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1) in R-loop
metabolism? RNase H1 has a clear biochemical ability to resolve R-loops and its over-expression in cells
suppresses a variety of genome instability phenotypes attributed to harmful R-loops. Yet, little direct evidence
exists to show that cellular RNase H1 expression resolves nuclear R-loops. Furthermore, recent studies and
our preliminary data suggest that RNase H1 could instead work by mitigating the impact of altered transcription
itself. To address these two possibilities, we will develop cellular models of RNase H1 depletion and over-
expression in mammalian cells and conduct a broad characterization of the resulting genomic R-loop patterns
and transcriptional effects. Our work will resolve crucial knowledge gaps concerning the formation and roles of
putative harmful R-loops in genome instability in human cells. The function and targets of nuclear RNase H1
will also be clarified, possibly revealing this enzyme in a fundamentally new light. We expect that this work will

 The long-term objective of this project is to develop a novel targeted therapy for human cancers by
reactivating the tumor suppression pathways. Although p53 is frequently mutated in almost 50% of human
cancers, many human tumors retain wild-type p53 but its activities are downregulated through multiple
mechanisms. Inactivation of Mdm2 is a validated approach for the treatment of human cancer retaining wild-type
p53 by reactivating the p53 tumor suppressor function. Through nearly two decades of intense efforts, a number
of highly potent small-molecule inhibitors and peptides that inhibit the MDM2–p53 interaction (also called Mdm2
inhibitors) have been successfully developed and validated in vitro, and several of these Mdm2 inhibitors have
been moved to human clinical trials for in vivo validation. Nevertheless, some serious challenges remain to be
addressed. The major issue is the dose-limiting toxicity because of low efficacy and severe toxicity to normal
tissues with increasing dosage of these Mdm2 inhibitors. Moreover, emergence of p53 mutations in cancer
patients developed highly resistance after the initial treatment with Mdm2 inhibitors. Thus, additional cancer
targets aiming at this pathway are clearly needed for more effective therapeutic purpose. In this application, we
plan to characterize novel small molecule USP7 inhibitors in activating p53 and cancer therapy. The
deubiquitinase USP7 (also called HAUSP) was one of the first deubiquitinases (DUBs) that exhibit a specific role
in regulating protein stability in vivo. Previous studies from our lab and others demonstrated that inhibition of
USP7 leads to p53 activation by destabilizing both Mdm2 and Mdmx. Notably, USP7 inhibitors are also able to
induce p53-independent tumor suppression functions in vivo. For example, we identified N-Myc, a major driver
in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis as a critical target for USP7. Recently, we discovered PD-L1 as another
important target of USP7. Taken together, these studies reveal that USP7 inhibitors have better efficacy because
USP7 inhibition activates p53-mediated tumor suppression by downregulating both Mdm2 and Mdmx and also
induces p53-independent tumor growth suppression by destabilizing N-Myc and PD-L1. Moreover, the tumors
with high levels of N-Myc or PD-L1 may not develop drug resistance even when the p53 gene is mutated. The
major hypothesis to be tested here is whether USP7 inhibitors are more effective and better therapeutic agents
for the treatment of human cancers. In Aim 1, we will further characterize novel USP7 inhibitors obtained from
our high-through-put screening assays in suppressing tumor growth through both p53 activation and N-Myc
destabilization in human neuroblastomas. In Aim 2, we will examine whether the USP7 inhibitor is able to
promote immunotherapy by downregulating PD-L1 in human cancer cells."

Monosodium urate-induced inflammation begins with hyperuricemia leading to monosodium urate (MSU) crystal
deposition in the joints and periarticular tissues. These deposits can cause inflammation, pain, and tissue
destruction through either acute inflammatory flares or chronic disease. In MSU-induced inflammation, activated
macrophages produce the pleiotropic cytokine Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) which is recognized as the major driver of
pathogenesis and a key inducer of other pro-inflammatory molecules. The inflammatory signaling cascade
begins with activation of Toll-like/IL-1β receptors (TIRs) in macrophages, which triggers production of pro-IL-1β
and other inflammasome components. Pro-IL-1β is then activated by cleaved caspase from the NOD-Like
Receptor Protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome before being exported and initiating further inflammation. Several
treatment options exist for gout patients, mostly falling into two categories – reduction of circulating levels of
soluble urate, or the suppression of pain and inflammation. These therapies, however, leave much to be desired
as they have significant adverse effects, deleterious drug-drug interactions, high cost and low/non-responder
groups. This project investigates a potential novel therapeutic agent for MSU-induced inflammation –
pentagalloyl glucose (PGG) – that is known to have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally,
our preliminary data shows that this compound inhibits xanthine oxidase which produces soluble urate. We also
demonstrate that PGG inhibits TGFβ-activated kinase which plays a role in the upregulation of proinflammatory
mediators critical to MSU-induced inflammation. Finally, we have demonstrated that PGG inhibits both a critical
downstream kinase and proinflammatory cytokines. In Aim one we will investigate the mechanism by which PGG
reduces MSU-induced inflammation in vitro using THP-1 macrophages, investigate the atomistic interactions of
PGG with MSU in-silico, then use phosphoproteomics to identify global changes induced by MSU and PGG. In
Aim two we will determine the effects of PGG treatment in vivo using mouse models of gout previously published
by our group. Taken together, these findings will provide a more complete knowledge of MSU-induced
inflammatory signaling while exploring a potential novel therapeutic and providing a training mechanism for this
student."
10707165,"Background. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) associates with high morbidity and mortality due to CKD
progression and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Blood pressure (BP) lowering reduces the risk of CVD and
CKD progression. In spite of the large number of BP medications available, a significant proportion of Veterans
with CKD have BP above the goal. The current practice involves licensed providers performing medication
titrations to achieve BP goals and is associated with limited patient engagement. Our preliminary data indicate
that the implementation of pharmacist-guided patient-driven titration of BP medications is effective and feasible
in CKD. In this model, Veterans self-manage their BP medications under the guidance of the clinical
pharmacist based on a pre-determined medication titration plan.
Significance. The prevalence of CKD is extremely high among Veterans, with some studies reporting a
prevalence of 47% (vs 11% in the general population). Here, we propose a novel interdisciplinary care model
that engages the Veterans as an active participant in their care with the goal of improving BP control to
improve long term outcomes. The application addresses a key HSR&D priority (management of complex
chronic disease).
Innovation and Impact. First, the proposed care model is one that has not been tested and includes the
clinical pharmacist working with the provider and the Veterans so that Veterans with CKD can self-manage
their hypertension. While self-management is exercised in CKD once patients are on dialysis (via home
dialysis modalities), the self-management approach is not utilized in the earlier stages of CKD. Second, in the
approach, we will utilize a transdisciplinary approach to evaluate the implementation of pharmacist-guided self-
management of BP medications and we will apply constructs of an implementation science framework,
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), to understand Veteran and system factors that
may either facilitate or impede the implementation and sustainment of the pharmacist-guided self-management
approach.
Specific aims. Specific aim 1 will evaluate if pharmacist-guided self-management of BP medications is more
effective than self-monitoring of home BP + the standard care amongst Veterans with CKD. Specific aim 2 will
identify and understand Veteran factors that may influence the acceptability of and the adherence to the self-
management approach whereas specific aim 3 will focus on understanding system factors that may facilitate or
impede the implementation of the self-management approach.
Methods. One hundred and sixty Veterans with uncontrolled hypertension and either stage 2 CKD with
albuminuria or stage 3 and 4 CKD will be randomized to either pharmacist-guided self-management or to self-
monitoring + the standard practice for 12 months. Aim 1 will evaluate change in [standardized] office systolic
BP at 12 months as the primary outcome. Aim 2 will utilize a mixed methods approach including semi-
structured interviews to evaluate a sample of 20 Veterans in each of the study arms. We will further design
data abstraction tools to evaluate the adherence to the intervention. In aim 3, we will utilize CFIR constructs to
guide our qualitative semi-structured interviews with key organizational stakeholders including PACT clinical
pharmacists, PCPs, and CKD providers (20 key stakeholders).
Implementation. The PI will implement the pharmacist-guided self-management approach with the Pharmacy
and Ambulatory care services as operational partners. The implementation of this approach will improve the
patient experience (Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients) and the quality of care
(Clinical Performance Measurement Program and the Strategic Analytics for Improvement and Learning)."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease and the most prevalent form
of dementia. AD is pathologically characterized by two misfolded and aggregated proteins:
amyloid-beta peptides (Aβ42) and hyperphosphorylated tau. Although Aβ42 accumulation,
produced amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is one of the earliest
pathological events, the initial trigger in proteostasis imbalance remains unknown. To investigate
proteostasis impairments in AD, our research utilizes metabolic pulse-chase (pc) labeling with
stable isotopes in combination with quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomic
analysis. Using this strategy with the recently developed APP knock-in (App KI) mouse models of
amyloid pathology, we discovered that axon terminals are selective sites of impaired protein
degradation, specifically synaptic vesicle (SV) and SV-associated proteins. This alteration
occurred before plaque pathology or elevated Aβ42 levels. This is important as it suggests we
have identified the earliest synaptic impairment in protein turnover that occurs before amyloid
pathology. Additionally, I recently discovered that targeting SVs with small molecule antiepileptic
drug levetiracetam in App KI mice mitigated AD pathology by decreasing Aβ42 accumulation via
alteration of amyloidogenic processing of APP. The goal of my proposed project is to uncover the
mechanism for impaired synaptic proteostasis in models of preclinical amyloid pathology that may
underlie the initial trigger in the cascade of pathologies seen in AD. One mechanism for turnover
at the presynapse is thought to rely on the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) marking proteins
for transport out of the axon terminal to the soma for degradation. The central hypothesis of my
proposal is that amyloidogenic processing of APP leads to a deficit to this key process resulting
in an impairment in axon terminal protein turnover. To address if disrupting this process impairs
axon terminal proteostasis, I propose the following aims. First, I will investigate in vivo if the UPS
is disrupted in App KI brains using previously pc-ed tissue and advanced MS techniques for
isolation and quantification of ubiquitinated proteins. Second, I will determine if disruptions in SV
transport result from amyloidogenic processing of APP and if this leads to mislocalization of APP
in vitro and finally will confirm these findings in human neurons derived from AD patients. Taken
all together, this proposed project will determine the initial mechanisms of AD-relevant protein
degradation impairments, crucial to determining the cause of protein accumulation in AD which
currently remains unknown."
10827368,"ABSTRACT
In response to persistent neurohormonal/hemodynamic stress or injury, the heart undergoes a pathologic
remodeling process typically characterized by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis. Cardiac fibrosis,
defined as excess extracellular matrix deposition in the heart, is a major contributor to both systolic and
diastolic dysfunction for millions of heart failure patients. Upon injury, resident quiescent fibroblasts undergo a
cell state transition to become activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts that hyper-secrete extracellular matrix
proteins and can be contractile. Fibrotic remodeling causes stiffening of the left ventricle, impaired relaxation,
reduced compliance, and altered electrical conductance. This drives disease progression and worsens
pathology. Despite the well-known contribution of cardiac fibrosis to adverse outcomes associated with heart
failure, effective therapies targeting fibrosis in the heart remain elusive. Inhibition of the BET (bromodomain
and extra-terminal domain) family of epigenetic reader proteins with chemical small molecules (e.g. JQ1) has
proven effective at blocking in vivo cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis and preserving cardiac
function in rodent models of heart failure. Though these inhibitors block all BET proteins in the heart (BRD2,
BRD3, BRD4), genetic targeting of individual BET proteins in cell culture experiments support the notion that
BRD4 is the main BET protein responsible for activation of pathologic gene expression programs in
cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. However, recent work has given insight on the cell-type specific role of
BRD4 in cardiomyocytes, uncovering an essential role for BRD4 in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis.
Conditional deletion of BRD4 in adult cardiomyocytes resulted in progressive cardiac dysfunction, impaired
mitochondrial function, and eventual death in mice. Taken together with previous studies, this suggests that the
beneficial effects of small molecule BET inhibitors in mouse models of heart failure are unlikely to be mediated
exclusively by inhibition of BRD4 in cardiomyocytes. We hypothesize that genetic in vivo disruption of BRD4 in
activated fibroblasts will safely block fibrosis and that multiple BET proteins (i.e. also BRD2 and BRD3)
mediate the beneficial effects of small-molecule pan-BET inhibition. In Aim 1, we will determine the in vivo role
of BRD4 in activated fibroblasts, and in Aim 2 we will elucidate the previously unexplored role of individual
BET proteins in cardiac cell gene expression regulation through ChIP-Seq. This work will be carried out in the
laboratory of Dr. Matthew Stratton, an expert in epigenetic regulation of pathologic cardiac remodeling, and
under the co-supervision of Dr. Loren Wold, a world-leader in cardiac physiology. Our long-term goal is to
develop safe and effective therapeutics to improve clinical outcomes for patients with cardiac fibrosis and HF."
10764242,"Background: Food insecurity is defined as limited or uncertain access to food due to household economic
restrictions and affects 1 in 4 post-9/11 Veterans. Food insecure Veterans have increased risk for mental
health conditions like depression and suicidal ideation. Current methods to reduce food insecurity focus on
immediate food access but do little to address underlying contributors such as such as unemployment, poor
access to healthcare, and social isolation. Fortunately, the VA has services that address these underlying
contributors. Unfortunately, more than half of post-9/11 Veterans have yet to enroll in, or use, VA programs
because they lack awareness of, and/or access to, services. Community-based VSOs are critical entry points
for Veterans with unmet social needs who have yet to connect with VA services. However, we know little about
their screening practices. Like in healthcare settings, robust screening and referral processes in community
settings are imperative; otherwise, a large portion of Veterans may continue to go without food. Significance:
The proposed CDA directly responds to the VHA HSR&D’s call for research to mitigate unmet social needs of
Veterans. Mounting evidence indicates that food provision alone does not improve food security. We need a
comprehensive approach that considers underlying contributors to food insecurity. Many of the 53% of post-
9/11 Veterans not enrolled in VA services separated with low enlistment ranks and/or are women. These
characteristics place them at increased risk for food insecurity. Thus, we also need to integrate robust
screening processes to identify Veterans who are food insecure where they are—in the community; otherwise,
a significant portion of Veterans may continue to go with unmet social needs. Innovation: The need to partner
with community-based organizations, VHA, and VBA to design an intervention that will address underlying
contributors through peer-support to reduce isolation and navigate existing resources is the basis for the
research proposed in this CDA. Our study will also, to my knowledge, be the first attempt to examine how
VSOs are screening for food insecurity and other health-related social needs. Specific Aims: My long-term
career goal is to be a VA-based independent investigator recognized for implementing innovative, community-
engaged solutions that tackle food insecurity and other social determinants of health. With guidance from my
mentorship team, I aim to increase proficiency with participatory research, expand knowledge on intervention
design and evaluation, and build implementation skills to translate evidence to practice. To support these
career objectives, during the CDA I propose to: Aim 1. Design a stakeholder-informed, wrap-around
intervention to help post-9/11 Veterans who are food insecure. Aim 2. Conduct a feasibility trial of a
stakeholder-informed, wrap-around intervention designed to provide Veterans who are food insecure with peer
support and connect to existing services that address underlying contributors to food insecurity. Aim 3.
Examine community-based screening practices for food insecurity and other health-related social needs in
Veterans. Methodology: We will use the human-centered design framework to design a wrap-around
intervention with key stakeholders (e.g., Veterans, community partner, VHA social work, and VBA outreach
specialists). We will then conduct a 12-week feasibility and acceptability trial of the intervention. In Year 4 and
5, we will conduct a landscape survey of screening practices among VSOs in Texas and 1:1 in-depth
interviews with select VSOs to further explore factors that facilitate and prevent screening in VSOs. Findings
will include stakeholder-informed process maps for screening. Next steps: The research generated from this
CDA will support an IIR submission to conduct a hybrid type 1 study of the stakeholder-informed, wrap-around
intervention and a proposal to initiate and/or expand screening of social needs in community settings. As a VA-
based nurse scientist, I will use the skills, mentorship, and experience gained from my CDA to generate
research that will inform practice and policy to address complex social needs affecting Veterans."
10735873,"CD28 is a T cell surface molecule that can provide a second signal, when combined with immobilized TCR
ligands, to induce naïve T activation. Costimulation results from the interaction of CD28 with its ligands CD80
(B7.1) and CD86 (B7.2) induced on activated antigen-presenting cells by activation of the innate immune
system. We do not have a good molecular understanding of how CD28 mediates its costimulatory signals.
Models and experimental evidence have suggested that CD28 either: 1) augments the magnitude of TCR
signaling; or, 2) provides a unique signal, qualitatively distinct from that provided by the TCR. It is important to
understand the molecular signaling pathways underlying costimulation since interrupting costimulation has
been important clinically. A deeper insight into CD28 signaling pathways may enable the development of new
therapeutics that would be useful in blocking the immune system. Very recent studies from my lab provide
some new insights and suggest approaches and clues that will enable us identify previously unrecognized
components of the CD28-regulated signaling pathways and permit a more complete understanding of CD28
signaling. These chemical-biology, genetic and proteomic studies lead us to hypothesize that an important
consequence of CD28 costimulation is the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and this influences
signals downstream of the TCR. We will explore this via the following specific aims: 1) Determine the
mechanism by which costimulation modulates the actin cytoskeleton to facilitate PLCγ1 mediated hydrolysis of
PIP2 in double positive (CD4+CD8+, DP) thymocytes and in more mature T cells; 2) Determine how CD28
overcomes a negative regulatory influence of Pyk2 and Cbl-b on T cell signaling leading to IL-2 production and
T cell proliferation; and, 3) Using recently obtained phosphoproteomic data, we will identify key components of
the pathway downstream of CD28 and those that modulate the actin cytoskeleton in response to CD28
costimulation."
10747849,"Spasticity is a debilitating condition which emerges in up to ~75% of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), with
most experiencing spastic episodes one year after injury. Current pharmacological approaches to decrease
spasticity (i.e. baclofen, tizanidine, botulinum toxin) lead to significant undesirable side effects such as sedation
and dizziness. More importantly, they also induce a profound depression of spinal reflex excitability which
significantly reduces muscle activity and impedes conventional rehabilitative efforts. There is therefore a critical
need to identify alternate avenues. The last decade has seen a critical breakthrough in the SCI field with the use
of stimulation-based therapies, in particular epidural stimulation, to further modulate the excitability of spinal
networks and enhance functional recovery after SCI. Although promising, these treatments are invasive, costly,
and require highly skilled and specialized teams. In contrast, non-invasive transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation
(tSCS) has the potential to be rapidly adapted in clinical rehabilitation settings. This project is designed to
advance our understanding of the neuroplasticity triggered by 6 weeks of repeated lumbar tSCS initiated acutely,
to prevent the development of spasticity, or chronically, to decrease spasticity once spinal hyperexcitability has
fully developed. Aim 1 will determine if tSCS contributes to decrease spasticity/hyperreflexia through restoring
spinal inhibition in lumbar spinal networks. Behavioral correlates of spasticity will be monitored over time. In a
terminal experiment, the effect of tSCS on spinal inhibitory pathways (homosynaptic depression, reciprocal
inhibition, and presynaptic inhibition) will be correlated to the reorganization of inhibitory/excitatory inputs to
motoneurons and primary afferents. Aim 2 will determine if tSCS restores motor-evoked potentials (MEPs)
originating from above and below the injury after SCI. During a terminal experiment, MEPs initiated by a
stimulation to the spinal cord below or above the injury will be recorded as well as synaptic transmission in the
cortico-reticulospinal pathway. The modulatory effect of proprioceptive feedback on the MEPs of various origin
will also be evaluated. The contribution of primary afferents (VGlut1+/paravalbumin) and descending tracts (vGi)
to increased motor output and normalization of the SCI-induced facilitation of proprioceptive afferents will be
evaluated. Because spastic symptoms, such as spasms and uncontrollable reflexes, render rehabilitation and
activity-based therapies such as locomotor training challenging and less effective, Aim 3 will determine if
decreasing spasticity with tSCS prior to the initiation of a step-training program improves locomotor recovery.
Spasticity and locomotor recovery will be evaluated over time and will be correlated to the return of spinal
inhibition and cortico-reticulospinal transmission. The proposed research project is consistent with the goals of
the NIH/NINDS by addressing a current gap in knowledge and delineating the mechanisms of tSCS.
Understanding the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of non-invasive interventions is critical to optimize
evidence-based clinical practice and fast-track its use in the SCI community."
10753487,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vascular calcification, especially coronary artery calcification (CAC), is associated with increased risk of
cardiovascular disease, whereas regular physical activity is associated with decreased risk. Thus, one would
predict that physically active individuals would have less CAC, yet clinical studies show the opposite. Elite
athletes actually have more CAC than their sedentary counterparts even though they have lower cardiac event
rates. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanism of this paradox. As clinical studies show
that coronary plaques containing large, contiguous calcium deposits are associated with less cardiovascular
risk than fragmented calcium deposits, one possibility would be that exercise remodels calcium deposits into a
more stable microarchitecture. Theoretical analytical modeling also predicts that decreased surface area of
calcium deposits is expected to reduce plaque rupture risk. Interestingly, a single bout of exercise in humans
and mice causes a transient 1.8-fold elevation of parathyroid hormone (PTH), and intermittent treatment of
PTH in humans and mice causes increased bone growth, which shares signaling mechanisms with vascular
calcification. Our recent findings provide an association between PTH and microarchitecture of vascular
calcium deposits, where intermittent PTH treatment reduces the surface area of aortic calcium deposits in
hyperlipidemic mice with pre-existing vascular calcification. Our preliminary studies provide a more direct
association of exercise with the remodeling of vascular calcium deposits. We found that hyperlipidemic mice
with pre-existing aortic calcification on a 9-week treadmill regimen had increased serum PTH levels, increased
PTH receptor levels in the aortic roots, and decreased mineral surface area by nuclear imaging and
histomorphometry. Thus, we hypothesize that exercise, through activation of the vascular PTH1 receptor,
shifts the microarchitecture of calcium deposits toward a more stabilized form, reducing the rupture risk. We
will test our hypothesis using 3 Specific Aims to determine: 1) whether loss of PTH1 receptor activation
blocks the exercise-induced remodeling of vascular calcium deposits; 2) the relative contributions of circulating
PTH and local (tissue) PTH related peptide (PTHrP) on the exercise-induced changes in microarchitecture;
and 3) effects of confounding factors (sex, exercise dose, diet, and species) on exercise-induced changes in
the SMC transcriptome and vascular calcium deposit microarchitecture. We will use pharmacologic, genetic,
and surgical models, and the endpoints will include progression and microarchitecture of aortic calcium
deposits, including size and surface area based on structural analyses (serial 18F-µPET/µCT,
histomorphometry), transcriptome analysis, and functional biomechanical analyses using a balloon catheter as
a mechanical sensor for rupture vulnerability. The proposed research is significant because it will determine
whether increased vascular calcification with intense exercise is protective or harmful and whether the effects
can be controlled by modulating PTH receptor activation."
10782972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has risen 10-fold over the past half century and
continues to have a dismal prognosis. Known modifiable risk factors for EAC do not adequately explain these
incidence trends; the rise in EAC cases began a decade before increases in the prevalence of both gastro-
esophageal reflux disease and obesity. Helicobacter pylori infection rates have plummeted since the mid-20th
century, and absence of H. pylori is associated with a ~2-fold increased risk of Barrett’s esophagus (BE), the
EAC precursor lesion, and of EAC itself. Loss of H. pylori is associated with profound shifts to gastric
microbiome composition. Thus, dramatic changes in the upper GI microbiome in western populations likely
occurred at the same time that BE and subsequently EAC began to rise in incidence. While prior work has
shown correlations between the microbiome, BE, and EAC, there is a critical knowledge gap on mechanisms
by which bacteria interact with the epithelium and potentially promote cancer. The mucus layer that overlies the
gut epithelium is critical to maintaining host-bacteria homeostasis. We hypothesize that increased levels of the
bile acid deoxycholic acid in gastro-esophageal refluxate results in increased Notch activity, which in turn
inhibits goblet cell differentiation and decreases mucus production. This may lead to mucus layer thinning,
facilitating the development of biofilms and leading to increased bacterial-epithelial interaction and chronic
inflammation, which promotes the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). In Aim 1, we will carry
out a case-control study of patients with and without BE, dysplasia, or EAC. We will focus on deoxycholic acid
in gastro-esophageal refluxate and its association with Notch signaling and bacterial composition. In Aim 2, we
focus on the relationship between Notch signaling and Enterobacteriaceae, which is increased in patients with
high grade dysplasia and early EAC. Finally, in Aim 3, we will perform a series of organoid-based experiments
to test the inter-relatedness between Notch, deoxycholic acid, and bacteria in BE. The microbiome represents
a novel and potentially modifiable risk factor for the development of BE and EAC. Elucidation of microbiome
features and mechanisms that promote neoplasia is a critical step that will lead to subsequent trials of
antibiotics, probiotics, and other interventions targeted to altering the microbiome, with the goal of lowering the
risk of this highly lethal malignancy."

 The “brain-eating amoeba” Naegleria fowleri causes a disease with a 97% fatality rate. Current
treatments are not reliable and risk significant side effects, including brain damage. Because cell proliferation is
essential for disease progression, and the microtubule network in Naegleria has evolutionarily diverged from
that in humans, targeting the mitotic spindle is a promising strategy to develop effective therapeutics with
limited side effects. However, we lack key information about the basic cell biological mechanisms that organize
the Naegleria mitotic spindle, hampering progress towards rational therapies. In particular, dynamic
microtubule turnover is critical in other cells for assembling a bipolar spindle, but it is not known to what extent
the Naegleria spindle relies on microtubule dynamics. A major obstacle is that inhibitors that block microtubule
dynamics in other species are ineffective against Naegleria’s divergent tubulins. Further, while microtubule
motor proteins play key roles in assembling spindles from diverse species, the function or even the identity of
microtubule motors within the Naegleria spindle is completely unknown. Lack of knowledge about the
mechanistic contributions of microtubule turnover and molecular motors to Naegleria spindle organization
constrains identifying key proteins and processes to target for antimicrobial development.
 This proposal will address this knowledge gap by testing the hypothesis that microtubule dynamics and
molecular motors both contribute to Naegleria spindle organization. To identify the role of microtubule
dynamics, microtubules will be stabilized with a class of inhibitors that was recently shown to block Naegleria
cell division, and the effect on the organization of the spindle will be measured with super-resolution
microscopy. Comparing untreated and drug-treated spindles at different mitotic stages will reveal which stages
require microtubule turnover. To determine the function of molecular motors in the spindle, motor genes
upregulated during cell division will be identified with RNA sequencing of mitotically synchronized Naegleria
cultures. These motors will be knocked down, and phenotypes scored by microscopy. The proposed project
will provide comprehensive training to prepare the applicant for a career as an independent investigator. With
support from a sponsor, who is a Naegleria expert, and a co-sponsor, who has decades of experience studying
cell division, the applicant will learn: new experimental techniques, such as super-resolution microscopy and
high-throughput sequencing; new conceptual approaches, including the biology of microtubules and mitosis;
and career development skills. This proposal will determine the impact of microtubule stabilization on the
Naegleria spindle and will identify the role of spindle associated molecular motors in spindle organization,
providing new targets for future treatments for the devastating disease caused by Naegleria."
10755291,"Shear Stress and Light-Field to Elucidate the Initiation of Cardiac Outflow Tract
Biomechanical forces modulate cardiac morphogenesis, and mutations in mechano-sensitive signaling
pathways result in congenital heart defects. During the previous funding cycle, our team custom-built a Light-
Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) with sub-voxel resolution to enhance axial resolution needed to
provide a large field-of-view. This laser optical system allowed for imaging pulsatile vs. oscillatory shear stress-
mediated Notch signaling to initiate endocardial trabeculation. We demonstrated that spatial (/x) and
temporal (/t) variations in shear stress modulates Notch-EphrinB2-Neureguilin-1 signaling in the
endocardium to activate erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase (ErbB2) that promotes proliferation of trabeculation.
By integrating LSFM, computation, and transgenic models, we further established that trabeculation dissipates
intracardiac shear stress-generated kinetic energy; thus, mitigating ventricular remodeling. However, it remains
unclear what would be the consequences of reduced myocardial contractility or altered intracardiac flow
dynamics on valve morphogenesis. Thus, we seek to integrate light-sheet (Bessel-Gaussian beam arrays) with
a new 2) light-field (microlens array). The former provides non-diffracting illumination, and the latter provides
volumetric detection as a paradigm shift to image both myocardial contractility and intracardiac flow dynamics
in the outflow tract (OFT). Our preliminary study reveals that shear-mediated Notch1b expression in the
endocardium of OFT regulates endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT); however, the
mechanotransduction causation whereby myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress reciprocally
interact to form bicuspid valves and subsequent remodeling to multi-cuspid valves remains elusive. Thus, our
hypothesis is that integration of the new light-field system with imaging computation enhances spatiotemporal
resolution needed to decouple myocardial contraction from intracardiac flow dynamics that modulates
Notch1b-EndoMT to mediate valve morphogenesis in the OFT. In Aim 1, we plan to integrate light-sheet with
the new light-field system for 4-D volumetric imaging of valve formation in the OFT. Our goal is to capture
myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress at one snapshot. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the
interaction between intracardiac shear stress and myocardial contractility underlying valve morphogenesis. Our
goal is to decouple hemodynamic shear from contractile forces that mediate Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. In
Aim 3, we will determine the relative role of shear stress and contractility underlying Notch1b-mediated
EndoMT. Our goal is to elucidate the relative role of contractility and intracardiac stress to transmit Notch1b-
EndoMT signaling underlying bicuspid-valve formation. Overall, our team aims to establish the micro-
environment in which intracardiac flow dynamics and myocardial contractility interact to modulate OFT valve
formation, with clinical significance to aortic valvular disease."

 Osteocytes form an interconnected network within bone by extending long dendritic projections that
connect to each other, to the vasculature, and to cells on the bone surface. Proper formation and maintenance
of these dendrites are critical for osteocyte viability and for osteocytic maintenance of the surrounding bone.
During aging and in many bone diseases, loss of osteocyte dendrites precedes osteocyte death and bone
fragility. However, we do not fully understand the mechanisms by which osteocytes form and maintain their
dendrites. We will take an innovative approach to improve understanding of osteocyte dendrite biology by
studying molecular mechanisms known to act in projections of other cells like neurons. Specifically, we will
examine the ability of osteocytes to traffic mRNA to their dendritic projections and locally translate proteins. Since
we have already demonstrated robust dendrite enrichment of over 400 mRNA transcripts, our rationale is that
osteocyte projections may share a common molecular regulatory mechanism with projections of other cell types
to regulate the local transcriptome, proteome, and function of this subcellular compartment. Mis-localization of
mRNA has been implicated in a wide range of disorders from neurodegenerative disease to cancer, but is
completely unexplored in osteocytes. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will advance
understanding of molecular cell biology in osteocytes, and it may provide new targets for therapies to treat bone
disease and improve bone fragility. We will test the hypothesis that osteocytes translate dendrite-enriched
mRNAs locally in dendrites, and that mRNAs are trafficked to dendrites via ‘zip code’ sequences in their 3’
untranslated region (3’UTR). In our first specific aim we will validate localization of top dendrite-enriched
transcripts in vivo using in situ hybridization in bone, and then we will demonstrate local translation of osteocyte
dendrite-enriched mRNAs using translational profiling and puromycin incorporation assays. We expect that
dendrite-localized transcripts encode proteins that play essential roles in the function of osteocyte dendrites and
will therefore be locally translated. In our second specific aim, we will identify ‘zip code’ localization sequences
in dendrite-enriched transcripts and RNA binding proteins that confer dendrite localization in osteocytes using a
heterologous reporter assay and then affinity purification with mass spectrometry. We expect that a fragment
within the 3’UTR of each dendrite-enriched transcript will serve as the binding site for an RNA binding protein
that trafficks that transcript to dendrites. The long-term goal of this work is to elucidate the contribution of
dendrite-localized mRNAs to formation and function of osteocyte dendrites, including the role of specific RNA
binding proteins and regulation of local translational activity. Together, this work will characterize a molecular
mechanism that is novel to osteocyte cell biology, inform future research on osteocyte maintenance of bone, and
provide a valuable training opportunity in new technical and professional skills."
10756085,"Project Summary/Abstract
Active listening is central to auditory cognition, supporting critical functions such as stream segregation,
linguistic analysis and perceptual learning. To this end, the brain must accurately represent the physical
properties of acoustic signals and subsequently parse sounds based on their behavioral relevance. Whereas
the encoding of primary features such as amplitude and spectral content typically begins in specialized
brainstem and midbrain circuits, the mechanisms by which sounds attain behavioral relevance are poorly
understood. A long-standing assumption is that descending projections from auditory cortex, which contact
most early ascending auditory circuits, play a critical role in ascribing behavioral relevance to sounds. Indeed,
descending auditory cortical projections could provide an anatomical substrate for ""top-down"" signals to control
the ""bottom-up"" encoding of acoustic features. Despite this presumed importance, little is known about the
function of descending auditory cortical neurons in attentive listening, nor do we understand the biophysical
mechanisms that dictate their contribution to central auditory processing. Our goal is to address these
knowledge gaps in behaving mice by studying the descending pathway from auditory cortex to inferior
colliculus, an auditory midbrain region critical for perceiving complex sounds. Our unpublished results support
a working hypothesis whereby auditory cortico-collicular neurons encode learned information, thereby
transmitting signals that amplify the representation of behaviorally relevant sound features in early auditory
circuits. Our data further suggest that a key mechanism underlying the activity of auditory cortico-collicular
neurons during active listening is the non-linear generation of dendritic spikes, powerful electrical events that
initiate in the apical dendrites of cortical neurons and drive high-frequency burst firing at the soma. We propose
testing these hypotheses using a unique combination of sub-cellular 2-photon Ca2+ imaging, optogenetics and
behavioral assays in awake, head-fixed mice. The positive outcome will be to establish functional and
mechanistic answers for the operation of a descending auditory cortical pathway during attentive listening,
thereby shedding light on a critical yet poorly understood facet of the central auditory system."
10763841,"Retinal bipolar cells are the first 'projection neurons' of the vertebrate visual system and transmit all of the
information needed for vision. Bipolar cells can signal change in contrast while providing an analog read-out of
luminance via changing the rate of neurotransmitter release (NTR). To maintain this ability, the bipolar cells
must have dynamic control over release rate and the efficient recruitment of release-ready vesicles to fusion
sites. However, the spatiotemporal properties of Ca2+ signals that control NTR, and the molecular entities that
control the interplay between Ca2+ signal and vesicle dynamics in sustaining kinetically distinct NTR
components remain poorly understood. The long-term goal is to unveil the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in retinal
ribbon synapses during development, normal adulthood, and disease. Within this goal, the overall objective of
this proposal is to determine the spatiotemporal properties of Ca2+ signals that control kinetically distinct pools
of NTR and the role of local Ca2+ signals in governing vesicle dynamics that sustain neurotransmission in
bipolar cell ribbon synapses. The central hypothesis is that Ca2+ domains governing kinetically distinct
components of NTR are different because the ribbon itself adds an additional compartment responsible for
spatial segregation of kinetically different synaptic vesicles and the underlying molecular targets that sense
Ca2+ concentration and/or alter Ca2+ signals. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data, acquired in
applicant’s laboratory using novel techniques developed for evaluating the traffic of single synaptic vesicles at
ribbons while simultaneously measuring the underlying changes in [Ca2+], all with millisecond temporal
precision. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims using a confluence of state-of-the-art
fluorescence imaging, voltage-clamp electrophysiology, computational modeling, electron microscopy of
individual physiologically identified cells, and pharmacological tools: 1) Reveal the mechanisms that determine
the spatiotemporal properties of calcium signals which control kinetically distinct neurotransmitter release
pools; and 2) Determine the interplay between local calcium signaling and vesicle replenishment that is
required for sustaining kinetically distinct components of NTR in rod bipolar cell ribbon synapses as a model
system. Dysregulation of Ca2+ signaling is a key early–stage process of neurodegeneration in age-related
retinal degenerations, glaucoma, diabetic, and optic neuropathies. The knowledge gained from studying Ca2+
dynamics in bipolar cell synaptic transmission will allow us to determine if defects with local Ca2+ homeostasis
are a prelude to disease in the future. Data generated from this proposal will have a broad impact that extends
beyond our specific investigation of rod bipolar cells and will be applicable to similar ribbon synapses located
within and outside the visual system and encoding distinct aspects of sensory information. More widely, our
data will be relevant to synapses throughout the central nervous system because the CAZ of ribbon synapses
shares many molecular components with conventional synapses."
10753525,"ABSTRACT
Preeclampsia (PE) is a disease of late pregnancy characterized by hypertension and organ damage, which not
only increases peripartum morbidity but is associated with the postpartum development of heart failure,
including myocardial fibrosis and systolic heart failure. Despite two decades of research demonstrating this
association and a large public health burden, the molecular mechanisms mediating PE-induced postpartum
heart failure remain poorly understood and therapies to prevent this outcome are lacking. One potential trigger
may be the profibrotic growth factor Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor beta family
produced by the placenta and inflammatory cells.
Using a randomized mechanistic clinical trial of aspirin vs. placebo for patients with preeclampsia, integrated
with studies of the mechanisms by which aspirin and Activin A might affect the heart, we will dramatically
advance knowledge of cardiac dysfunction in preeclampsia and its possible treatments. We pursue two specific
aims to answer these questions. AIM 1 is a randomized trial to test whether aspirin improves cardiac function
and decreases Activin A in women with preeclampsia. AIM 2 Identifies how increased plasma Activin A during
pregnancy causes postpartum cardiac dysfunction and how aspirin prevents it. This project innovates
methodologically and at the bench in order to dramatically advance our understanding of a major cause of
morbidity and mortality in women globally."
10775738,"SUMMARY: PROJECT 2- MODULATING FACTORS
 Disappointing results from recent trials targeting b-amyloid alone underscore it is critical that we identify,
measure, and better understand factors outside of canonical Alzheimer’s pathology that influence the
emergence of late-life cognitive decline. This need is particularly acute for potentially-modifiable risk factors for
decline that can be targeted for intervention, either alone or in combination with therapies directed at b-amyloid
or tau. In this context, this new project will leverage several core strengths of the Harvard Aging Brain Study
(HABS) to assess the extent to which physical activity, inflammatory, and vascular factors modify longitudinal
cognitive decline, MRI-based measures of neurodegeneration, and whether these potentially-modifiable risk
factors interact with Alzheimer’s disease pathological cascades to cause accelerated neurodegeneration and
cognitive decline. Aims 1 and 2: Building on cross-sectional and longitudinal PET, MRI, and cognitive data
available in HABS, we will add objective, longitudinal assessments of vascular risk, white matter disruption due
to putative cerebrovascular injury, and assessment of day and night activity patterns. Primary analyses for
these aims will assess whether individual variations in vascular and activity parameters presage longitudinal
changes in cognition (jointly with Project 4), changes in hippocampal volume, and in the accumulation of tau
pathology as measured by PET (jointly with Project 1). Secondary analyses will assess regional variations in
brain atrophy, examine the interplay of activity patterns with functional network integrity (jointly with Project 3),
and identify cognitive domains which may be differentially impacted by these modulating factors. Together with
the Analytic Core, we will employ causal models to examine the directionality of vascular and activity effects on
cognitive and neurodegenerative trajectories and examine whether activity effects can be ascribed to reverse
causation. Aim 3: In this exploratory aim, we will use a focused set of biofluid markers of vascular,
inflammatory, and neurodegenerative processes to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the modulating
factors we examine here. Together, these studies will allow us to develop a broader understanding of how
these potentially-modifiable factors may interact with b-amyloid to modulate cognitive decline and
neurodegeneration, and to go deeper by using newly-available, high-sensitivity immunoassays to identify
biologic pathways underlying the effects of these potentially-modifiable risk factors."

mDOT – Technology Training & Dissemination (TT&D) 
Abstract: 
The mHealth Center for Discovery, Optimization & Translation of Temporally-Precise Interventions (the mDOT 
Center) will enable a new paradigm of temporally-precise medicine to maintain health and manage the growing 
burden of chronic diseases. The mDOT Center will develop and disseminate the methods, tools, and 
infrastructure necessary for researchers to pursue the discovery, optimization and translation of temporally- 
precise mHealth interventions. Such interventions, when dynamically personalized to the moment-to-moment 
biopsychosocial-environmental context of each individual, will precipitate a much-needed transformation in 
healthcare by enabling patients to initiate and sustain the healthy lifestyle choices necessary for directly 
managing, treating, and in some cases even preventing the development of medical conditions. Organized 
around three Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects, mDOT represents a unique national 
resource that will develop multiple methodological and technological innovations and support their translation 
into research and practice by the mHealth community in the form of easily deployable wearables, apps for 
wearables and smartphones, and a companion mHealth cloud system, all open-source. 
Given that the inherently transdisciplinary, team-based nature of mHealth research requires scientists to cross 
disciplinary and institutional boundaries, training and dissemination in mHealth technologies requires a team- 
science approach. mDOT will leverage its established and highly successful infrastructure, widely visible 
mHealthHUB platform, and deeply-experienced team to develop training and dissemination activities that extend 
beyond the collaborative projects (CPs) and service projects (SPs) to involve new research groups with little or 
no technological expertise. To achieve its goals, mDOT will pursue the following activities. First, it will provide 
direct training activities that leverage annual workshops, conferences, and meetings of professional societies, 
and will conduct the annual mHealth training institute to develop a perpetuating cadre of outside researchers 
well-equipped to apply mDOT technologies and methods. Second, it will provide “light-touch” outreach using 
web-portals with “heavy-touch” outreach activities including training sessions, workshops, and conferences to 
inform the scientific community about the technical capabilities and accomplishments of mDOT, and to both 
promote and enable a broader use of the mDOT methods and technologies. Importantly, mDOT’s training and 
dissemination activities are anchored in an organizing logic model with articulated inputs/outputs. A combination 
of Google Analytics and Robotic Process Automation will automate repetitive evaluative tasks to assess the 
uptake and impact of the mDOT’s tools via the TT&D activities by a diverse population of mHealth researchers.

10775743,"SUMMARY: PROJECT 3- SYNAPTIC FUNCTION
The proximal cause of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is synaptic dysfunction and synaptic
loss. As summarized in Projects 1 and 4, there is consistent evidence that amyloid-beta (aβ) is associated with
cognitive decline, that aβ alone is not sufficient, and that rates of cognitive decline are considerably
heterogeneous . Consequently, assessment of synaptic integrity is pivotal for linking the deleterious effects of
AD and other age related pathology with resilience or susceptibility to cognitive decline. The goal of Project 3
is to explore and build upon our understanding and capacity to assess synaptic integrity within the AD
spectrum and beyond through innovative multimodal PET and MRI imaging and quantitation. In Aim 1, we will
extend and build upon our prior work with resting state functional connectivity, focusing on relating longitudinal
change in a composite measure of functional network connectivity to change in cognition, aβ, tau, or
modulating factors (Project 2). In Aim 2, we will extend and build upon our multimodal functional imaging
capabilities through inclusion and characterization of a proxy measure of relative blood flow derived from the
wash-in of the PiB tracer (
PiB-R1). In conjunction with FDG-PET and resting state functional connectivity MRI
(rs-fcMRI), we will evaluate whether
PiB-R1 is a useful proxy for FDG, if change in
PiB-R1 is an informative
measure for cognition, molecular pathology, or modulating factors, and whether PiB-R1 can control for flow
effects in other functional imaging modalities. In Aim 3, we will go beyond the available arsenal of functional
measures, with an exploratory investigation of a new synaptic imaging radioligand for TARPγ8, the regulatory
protein for AMPA receptors, that is highly expressed in hippocampus. This is a high risk, but potentially high
reward, aim that is an important step towards a more direct assessment of synaptic integrity. Utilizing a subset
of HABS participants, we will acquire TARPγ8-PET imaging and assess relationships between TARPγ8-PET
and measures hypothesized to be related to synaptic dysfunction (age, cognition, hippocampal volume, FDG,
and fMRI), as well as PET measures of Alzheimer’s disease molecular pathology. If successful, TARPγ8-PET
imaging will provide an opportunity to compare our functional imaging measures from Aims 1 and 2 to a more
direct synaptic assessment and allow us to better characterize the extent and manner in which current
functional imaging measures reflect synaptic integrity related to AMPA receptor signaling. By leveraging the
rich longitudinal characterization of the HABS cohort, including data collected during the first two grant cycles,
and the resources of the other projects and cores, Project 3 will focus on synaptic integrity as a means to
bridge the gap between pathological markers with heterogeneous time-dependent influences and cognitive
decline in order to provide a better understanding of brain aging and early AD."
10775749,"SUMMARY—PROJECT 4: COGNITION. Given the series of disappointing clinical trial results at symptomatic
stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), it has become even more urgent to elucidate the temporal relationships
between accumulation of the molecular pathology of AD and the emergence of the earliest clinical
manifestations. Over the second cycle of Project 4, we found consistent evidence that elevated amyloid-beta
(aβ) is associated with future cognitive decline; however, there is considerable heterogeneity in rates of
decline. It is increasingly clear that aβ in isolation is not sufficient for imminent decline, and it is possible that aβ
becomes much less relevant once tau pathology and neurodegeneration are widespread. Thus, we now seek
to better understand the patterns of cognitive change associated with the earliest phases of accumulation of
both aβ and tau, even below current thresholds for abnormality, and to characterize the “pre-preclinical” phase
of AD, as well as the factors that promote successful aging and resilience to cognitive decline. At the other end
of the preclinical AD spectrum, we will investigate whether early cognitive change is predictive of progression
to clinical impairment, as we will have up to 15 years of follow-up. In Aim 1, we strive to further elucidate the
temporal association between longitudinal aβ and tau accumulation and cognitive trajectories. In addition to
our work with the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC), we will go deeper and focus on the
specific cognitive processes associated with the earliest accumulation of aβ and tau, in the context of the
multiple factors that may interact with these pathologies. In Aim 2, we will utilize digital technology to advance
our work to go faster by detecting cognitive change more rapidly and with greater specificity and accuracy.
Our initial work using home iPAD testing revealed a marked lack of “practice effect” despite repeated exposure
to face-name pair stimuli every month on the iPad, associated with elevated aβ. We now propose to test
whether we can detect a similar pattern of diminished practice effect over a period of days. We have also
begun working with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) software platform using a digital pen to capture subtle
cognitive inefficiencies in non-memory processes. In Aim 3, we will go broader, beyond cognitive testing, to
examine clinically relevant measures that include self- and study-partner report of cognitive function, every day
activities, and neurobehavioral alterations to elucidate potential bi-directional relationships and temporal
sequence of these changes along the trajectory of preclinical AD. We will use these measures to assess the
“clinical meaningfulness” of early cognitive change, and to improve our predictions of progression to clinical
impairment, in combination with imaging AD markers. Project 4 will leverage the rich longitudinal
neuropsychological, behavioral, and multi-modality imaging data available on the HABS cohort to improve our
understanding of relationships between the accumulation of aβ and tau in the aging brain and cognitive
trajectories, and ultimately to inform ongoing and future trials aiming to prevent cognitive decline."
10771137,"The importance for vision of the tiny fovea has been established by centuries of investigation as well as
observations of the devastating consequences of its damage through injury or disease. Though evidence
suggests that the fovea contains the full complement of the two dozen or so classes of ganglion cells found in
peripheral retina, we know little about the physiology of these foveal cells. This gap in our understanding is the
result of challenges in obtaining electrophysiological recordings from this delicate and topographically-complex
structure. These challenges have been overcome by a method developed in our laboratory that allows
simultaneous calcium imaging of the fluorescence responses of hundreds of foveal retinal ganglion cells in
response to visual stimuli. Because this technique allows recording from single cells without damage in the living
eye, we can study the same cells for months or even years, offering the opportunity to characterize the
performance of each cell more thoroughly than has been possible with any prior method. Since the first
submission of the proposal, we have made significant improvements in the expression of calcium indicator,
GCamMP6s, in ganglion cells that increases the extent of expression to greater eccentricities, the fluorescence
signal from each cell, as well as reducing the loss of ganglion cells over time. Moreover, we have designed a
new ophthalmoscope with two independent adaptive optics systems, one dedicated to high resolution stimulus
delivery and a second dedicated to high resolution ganglion cell recording. We have also developed an extensive
battery of visual stimuli to characterize the responses of each cell in space, time, and color. This battery will
include a white noise stimulus capable of identifying the locations and classes of single cone inputs to the
receptive fields of foveal ganglion cells. To assist in cell classification, these physiological observations will be
supplemented with ex vivo and in vivo histological analysis of the morphology of ganglion cell dendritic arbors.
Armed with these improvements, we will undertake a comprehensive survey of both the physiology and anatomy
of the foveal ganglion cell classes that mediate primate foveal vision."
10752613,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vision is an active sense, with eye movements powerfully shaping the acquisition of visual
information about the world. This project investigates how motor learning adjusts the neural
circuitry controlling eye movements, to maintain the accuracy of eye movements over short and
long time scales. The specific focus of the research is to understand how oculomotor learning,
i.e., improvement of the accuracy of eye movements through experience, is transferred from
short-term to long-term storage. This consolidation process occurs, not only for motor skills like
eye movements, but is a general feature of learning and memory systems. Some memories,
including oculomotor memories, are transformed during the time after the initial acquisition of the
memory, in a way that renders older, consolidated memories independent of brain areas that are
critical for newer memories. This process, known as systems consolidation, is thought to depend
on activity of neurons in the brain area initially critical for the memory, and the hypothesis is that
this activity induces changes in the brain area(s) supporting long-term storage of the memory.
The proposed research characterizes the nature of the neural signals transmitted between brain
areas supporting memory at different times after their acquisition, and the rules that operate on
those neural signals to implement stable transfer of a memory from one brain area to another."
10767273,"Sensitive imaging biomarkers are urgently needed for screening of high‐risk subjects, determine
early disease progression, and assess response to therapies in neurodegenerative disorders.
The atrophy of several brain regions is an established biomarker in AD, which strongly
correlates with AD neuropathology. The accuracy of subfield volumes and cortical thickness
estimated from current MRI methods is limited because of the vulnerability to motion, low
spatial resolution, low contrast between brain sub‐structures, and dependence of current
segmentation frameworks on image quality. Short motion‐compensated MRI protocols to map
the human brain at high spatial resolution with multiple contrasts, along with accurate and
computationally efficient segmentation algorithms, are urgently needed tor early detection and
management of subjects with neurodegenerative disorders.
We propose to introduce a 15‐minute motion‐robust 3‐D acquisition and reconstruction
scheme to recover whole‐brain MRI data with 0.2 mm isotropic resolution with several
different inversion times on 7T, along with segmentation algorithms that are robust to
acceleration. The key difference of this framework from current approaches, which rely on MRI
data 1 mm resolution, is the quite significant increase in spatial resolution to 0.2 mm as well as
the availability of multiple conteasts. This improvement is enabled by innovations in all areas of
the data‐processing pipeline, including acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. These
innovations are facilitated and integrated by the model based deep learning framework
(MoDL); this framework facilitates the joint exploitation the available prior information,
including motion and models for magnetization evolution, with convolutional neural network
blocks that learn anatomical information from exemplar data. The successful completion of this
framework will yield sensitive biomarkers, which will be considerably less expensive than PET
and does not involve radiation exposure. As 7T clinical scanners become more common, this
framework can emerge as a screening tool for high‐risk subjects (e.g. APOE, PSEN mutations)
and assess progression in patients with short follow‐up duration."
10753503,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer (OC) is the eleventh most common cancer and fifth deadliest among U.S. women. The low
incidence, high fatality and molecularly broad range of tumor histotypes make OC challenging to study and to
treat. Consequently, survival rates have scarcely changed over the past 35 years, largely because precision
therapy lags behind most other cancers. Endometrioid (ENOC) and clear cell (CCOC) account for ~25% of all
invasive OC. They are a heterogeneous and understudied group of tumors that are closely associated with
endometriosis, but show few similarities to the more common high grade serous OC. ENOC or CCOC have
variable or poor response to standard platinum-based chemotherapy. CCOC, in particular, is more likely to be
platinum resistant at early stage and resistant to second line chemotherapy at advanced stage, resulting in
worse survival than HGSOC. We hypothesize that molecular tumor subtypes exist for ENOC and CCOC that
reflect differences in biological processes and risk factors and that might inform new treatment strategies. Our
preliminary results using genomics analyses of 185 ENOC and 115 CCOC supports this hypothesis by
showing that associations with survival and risk factors such as smoking and body mass index differ according
to the tumor’s molecular profile, with some subgroups showing rapidly fatal outcome. In the current proposal,
we intend to delve deeper into the genomic profile of ~1,100 ENOC and CCOC tumors to identify key
molecular features of the tumor subtypes. Our approach uses a consortium effort that combines existing data
from well-conducted epidemiologic studies of risk factors with corresponding clinical information among
investigators with a strong history of collaboration. We will first characterize molecular subtypes, separately for
ENOC and CCOC, by integrating sequencing and array data from gene expression, mutations and methylated
regions from a training set (483 ENOC, 292 CCOC) using statistical clustering. Next, we will assess replication
of the molecular subtypes in an independent test set (207 ENOC, 125 CCOC). To assess subtype-specific
associations in the total sample (689 ENOC, 417 CCOC), we will relate molecular subtypes of ENOC and
CCOC separately to risk factors and to survival. Impact: Less common OC such as ENOC or CCOC are often
overshadowed by investigations of more common cancers, yet our data show that ENOC and CCOC can also
be rapidly fatal in certain patient subsets or show more favorable outcome in others, directly impacting patients’
lives. Finding patterns with other cancers by using integrated analysis of ENOC and CCOC subtypes has high
potential to inform new avenues for targeted therapy and to enhance understanding of ENOC and CCOC
cancer biology. Future replication of our findings using an independent 1,400 ENOC/CCOC tumors from our
unique consortia resources can lead to needed gains in biological, epidemiologic and therapeutic insights for
these patients."
10782448,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Microtubules are protein polymers that are essential for neuronal cell morphogenesis during
development. Microtubule assembly and function rely on the regulation of lattice-bound microtubule-associated
proteins (MAPs). Many known MAPs influence microtubule stability and organelle transport, and some of them
are highly associated with neurodegeneration. The proposed study will investigate a unique family of MAPs
that interact with both microtubules and the motor protein kinesin-1. Our recent study of its founding member
MAP7 provides the first demonstration of the neuronal function of this less-well understood MAP. MAP7 is
developmentally regulated to promote axonal branch formation of sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion
(DRG). Using primary neuronal cell culture, we have found that MAP7 regulates branch formation and growth.
Further cell biological analysis has revealed that MAP7 regulates microtubule stability and kinesin-1-mediated
organelle transport, two processes that are critical to axonal morphogenesis and function. Recently, we expand
our studies in several directions. First, we analyzed another MAP7D1, a closest MAP7 homolog and found that
it has similar properties and redundant function as MAP7 in culture. Second, we developed a new assay to
show the potential role of MAP7 in regulating transport during branch growth. Third, in the study of MAP7
mouse mutants, we found a potential new role of MAP7 in nociception. Following these findings, we
hypothesize that the MAP7 family proteins provide a novel mechanism and play multiple roles in axonal branch
development and function by regulating organelle transport. To test this hypothesis, we ask three questions: 1)
Are both MAP7/MAP7D1 required for branch development of DRG neurons? 2) How does MAP7 regulate
organelle transport for branch growth and nociception? 3) is the nociception function specific for MAP7
expressed in DRG neurons and its interaction with kinesin-1? Answering these questions will not only expand
our knowledge of this novel family of MAPs but also address fundamental questions regarding microtubule-
based intracellular transport in neuronal development and function. More importantly, our proposed studies
with a focus on DRG sensory neurons will allow us to explore the role of transport regulation in nociception and
thus bring us closer to medically relevant problems, such as pain. Given the importance of nociception and
pain in human health, our proposed studies with a focus on a fundamental cell biological problem are thus
highly relevant to the NIH mission of investigating brain functions and disorders."

 Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are a
common cause of lung adenocarcinoma. Despite marked advances in targeted therapies for EGFR-mutant lung
cancer, treatment-acquired resistance remains a major problem.
 Understanding and overcoming acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and to
other targeted therapies is a central problem in cancer medicine. Our long term goal is to develop more effective
and better tolerated therapies for EGFR mutant lung cancer that yield durable responses. We reason that
simultaneous treatment with multiple agents targeting mutant EGFR may prevent emergence of resistance
mutations, leading to more durable responses. However, suitable compounds with alternative mechanisms of
action have not previously been available. Like the vast majority of TKIs, all current EGFR TKIs target the ATP-
site of the kinase. Our multidisciplinary research team has deep expertise in EGFR-mutant lung cancer and a
record of successful inhibitor discovery. In the initial grant period, we developed highly potent allosteric inhibitors
based on a phenylglycine scaffold that are effective as single agents against L858R/T790M and
L858R/T790M/C797S EGFR variants in vitro and in mouse models of human non-small cell lung cancer. The
distinct mechanism of action and binding site of these allosteric inhibitors, together with their lack of potency on
WT EGFR and other protein kinases, makes them especially attractive as candidates for combination therapy.
 In this renewal, we will discover whether compounds that target the ATP and allosteric sites can indeed
synergize to deliver unprecedented efficacy, tolerability and durability of responses. We pursue this goal through
the following specific aims: Aim 1, We will develop a second chemical series of highly potent, mutant-selective
allosteric EGFR inhibitors based on a benzodiazepinone scaffold. Aim 2, We will design and optimize
complementary pairs of inhibitors that simultaneously bind the adjacent ATP and allosteric sites of mutant EGFR
with a high degree of positive cooperativity. To our knowledge, highly cooperative, multi-site inhibition has not
been previously explored in the context of therapeutic development. Aim 3, We will perform pre-clinical validation
of allosteric EGFR inhibitors and complementary ATP-site/allosteric pairs, including testing their in vivo efficacy
in xenograft models of EGFR mutant lung cancer and assessing the potential for resistance to arise in the context
of dual targeting. Successful execution of these aims will provide proof of concept for a new therapeutic approach
in EGFR mutant lung cancer."

 Menopause is an inevitable stage in normal human aging, affecting the quality of life of millions of women all
over the world. Menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, sleep disorders, depression/anxiety, decline in
cognitive function (Alzheimer’s disease is more prevalent in women and linked to estrogen), cardiovascular
disease, genitourinary conditions, and osteoporosis. These symptoms have been shown to be causally linked to
a sharp decline in circulating sex steroid concentrations after menopause. While men have similar decline in sex
hormones, andropause symptoms are usually infrequent and mild. Consequently, menopausal symptoms are of
considerably more pressing medical concern in elderly women than andropause in elderly men. Thus, this
proposal focuses on women’s health and improved therapies for menopause.
 The most immediate and patient reported ‘unbearable’ symptom of the menopause are hot flushes, which
cause not only physical discomfort but also negatively impact mood, behavior and general quality of life. Among
current treatments of hot flushes, only estrogen therapy (ET) and hormone therapy (HT, estrogens and
progestins) have satisfactory efficacy. Although ET/HT prevents hot flushes, they have unwanted side effects in
the periphery, including the stimulation of the uterus and breast leading to a significantly increased cancer risk
in these organs. Although there have been extensive efforts to develop safer estrogens, the lack of animal
model(s) that naturally recapitulate the symptoms and pathophysiology of human menopause has had a
tremendous negative impact on the success of this effort. Only humans and our close mammalian cousins exhibit
menopausal hot flush symptoms in normal aging or with ovariectomy. However, the most commonly utilized
model for thermoregulation is rodent, which is limited for translational drug discovery with human menopause as
rodents do not normally flush and do not sweat.
 We developed an old-world advanced translational animal model which undergoes a menopausal process that
is hormonally identical to that of human women. We show that ovariectomy induces hot flushes that are
exacerbated by niacin and nearly eliminated by estrogen therapy. This also involved development of novel use
of non-invasive thermal imaging to detect these events, alleviating the need for older train-and-restrain models
used in this species for hot flush research in the past. Using this model, we propose to test a novel estrogen
prodrug therapy using 10β,17β-dihydroxyestra-1,4-dien-3-one (DHED). DHED has ideal properties for a
translational therapy for hot flushes. In the prodrug form it is highly shelf-stable at room temperature, can be
taken orally, has no peripheral bioactive properties in the prodrug form and it is selectively converted to estrogen
only in the brain, resulting in no peripheral side effects on uterus/breast. We propose a comprehensive testing
of the pharmacological effectiveness of DHED to treat hot flushes in our advanced translational model as a key
step to human clinical trials."
10806126,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, is the leading cause of mortality in the USA and new therapeutics
are needed to better treat these diseases. Cardiac hypertrophy is the process by which the heart becomes larger
in response to an increased workload and although initially adaptive, this often leads to maladaptive cardiac
remodeling and is involved in the pathogenesis of several cardiac diseases. Rac1, a Rho family small GTPase,
is required for the development of cardiac hypertrophy and relatedly plays an important role in mediating
oxidative stress in the heart as a regulatory subunit of the NAPDH oxidase 2 (Nox2) enzyme complex. Both
hypertrophy and oxidative stress promote the progression of heart failure and therefore determining novel
regulatory mechanisms controlling these processes is of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry. Rac1 is
palmitoylated at Cys-178 which promotes its activation and membrane targeting. Palmitoylation is a reversible
post-translational lipid modification that dynamically regulates protein signaling and has been shown to be
required for pathologic signaling in several disease states. Importantly, both genetic and small molecule
strategies have been effectively utilized to target palmitoylation of specific proteins in pre-clinical models of
diseases such as cancer and inflammation. However, the role of palmitoylation in regulating pathologic signaling
in the heart remains untested. Excitingly, our preliminary data demonstrate that genetic inhibition of Rac1
palmitoylation protects neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, a common in vitro model of cardiac disease, from both
hypertrophy and oxidative stress induced by hyperactive Rac1 signaling. Therefore, we hypothesize that
palmitoylation of Rac1 at Cys-178 targets Rac1 to the membrane where it is activated and induces pathogenic
signaling in part through regulation of the Nox2 complex. This proposal seeks to determine the function of Rac1
palmitoylation in regulating cardiac hypertrophy and oxidative stress in vivo using two relevant models of cardiac
hypertrophy. We will use a chronic AngII infusion model of cardiac hypertrophy as well as a model using AAV-
mediated overexpression of constitutively active Rac1, which causes dilated cardiomyopathy. In these models,
we will test the effect of mutating Cys-178 to serine (C178S) which cannot be palmitoylated to rigorously
determine the necessity of palmitoylation for the development of cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial oxidative
stress. The results of this work will test, for the first time, a role for palmitoylation-dependent signaling in
regulating the progression to heart failure. This fellowship will provide me with the training necessary to succeed
as an independent scientist in the pharmaceutical industry as well as make significant contributions to our shared
scientific knowledge that have the potential to improve human health."
10757342,"Combinatorial dietary approaches to prevent highly fatal estrogen receptor-negative [ER(-)] breast cancer
(BC) can offer many advantages over single-agent approaches, most notably the potential for greater efficacy
without increased risk of toxicity. We have shown that combined green tea polyphenols that inhibit DNA
methyltransferases and sulforaphane in broccoli sprouts that inhibits histone deacetylases can significantly
delay ER(-) BC initiation and impede its progression at practical and safe dietary levels. Our results have also
shown that the epigenetic machinery is mechanistically important to the efficacy of ER(-) BC prevention
by these diets. Maternal or paternal consumption of this combinatorial regimen can lead to increased latency
and reduced tumor growth in ER(-) BC offspring that have consumed a control diet. Our field-driving studies
show for the first time that this combinatorial diet impacts the epigenome and gene expression of gametes
strongly supporting transgenerational epigenetic effects. Our hypothesis is that combinatorial green tea
polyphenols and sulforaphane-enriched broccoli sprout diets can extend their epigenetic-neutralizing ER(-) BC
preventive effects from one generation to another either through transplacental effects or through
transgenerational effects. These studies will be important to resolving the generational efficacy of
combinatorial cancer prevention and the epigenetic mechanisms through which this effect is mediated. Since
our preliminary findings have indicated that consumption of this combinatorial diet can operate through the
paternal as well as maternal lineage to prevent ER(-) BC in control-fed female offspring, this strongly suggests
that the gametogenic epigenetic changes we have discovered have mechanistic importance for
transgenerational effects in addition to transplacental effects in mothers fed this combinatorial diet. The
paternal effects on epigenetic control of key tumor-related genes by this combinatorial epigenetic-modulating
diet will contribute significantly to elucidation of the mechanisms through which this diet confers preventive
effects on ER(-) BC. One of the goals of this proposed innovative investigation is to resolve the generational
ER(-) BC cancer preventive impact of combinatorial epigenetic-modulating green tea polyphenols and
sulforaphane-enriched broccoli sprouts and the epigenetic and epigenomic mechanisms responsible for their
efficacy. This proposed investigation will have considerable impact in that the consumption of a combined
epigenetic-modulating diet by either the mother or father to delay and reduce ER(-) BC in their offspring would
have broad implications for new perspectives for cancer prevention. Further, ER(-) BC is often recalcitrant to
conventional modes of cancer therapy which significantly increases the importance of means to facilitate its
prevention. Novel approaches to reducing the risk of ER(-) BC through maternal and/or paternal
consumption of this combinatorial diet would contribute significantly to enhanced ER(-) BC prevention
and perhaps preventive control of other cancers worldwide."
10753552,"Heart failure (HF) is the most common reason for hospitalization and death among those older than 65 years,
and statistic is projected to grow as our population ages. The socioeconomic impact of HF on our health care
system is enormous. Development of innovative approaches to the treatment of HF is therefore a top research
priority. Although inflammation and immune activation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of HF over
the past two decades, the progress for development of new pharmaceutical agents targeting this mechanism
was stagnant, especially given that several anti-cytokine clinical trials targeting a single effector cytokine at the
peripheral manifestations of HF did not produce clinical benefits. Obviously, the inflammatory mechanisms
underlying the pathogenesis of HF have not been challenged. The proposed project studying a role of brain
interleukin (IL)-17A (previously known as IL-17) in advancing central inflammation, sympathetic activation and
cardiac dysfunction will address the need for a better understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms in HF
and provide a novel anti-cytokine approach in treating this devastating disease. The research plan was
developed based on the intrinsic property of IL-17A and our compelling preliminary data: 1) IL-17A is a kay
inflammatory regulator bridging immune responses and tissue inflammation; 2) It boosts the expression of a
broad spectrum of inflammatory mediators in the brain and in the peripheral tissue and cells; 3) Systemic and
central administration of IL-17A induced dramatic and long-lasting increases in blood pressure, heart rate and
renal sympathetic nerve activity to the levels not seen by other pre-inflammatory cytokines; 4) levels of IL-17A
in the plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN, a key cardiovascular
and autonomic center of the brain) are higher in a rat model of HF vs. in sham-operated (Sham) animals; and 5)
Its receptor, IL-17RA, is highly expressed in the PVN and substantially upregulated in HF. Using a multifaceted
approach including electrophysiology, molecular biology, immunocytochemistry, pharmacology, biochemistry
and neuroscience in Sham and HF rats, this project will: 1) identify the role of IL-17A in advancing central
inflammation in HF; 2) determine the inflammatory mechanisms whereby IL-17A triggers sympathetic activation
in HF; 3) evaluate the protective effect of central interventions targeting the IL-17A signaling, alone or in
combination with other cytokines in HF. The proposed research will target a master regulator of inflammation
rather than a single effector cytokine as a novel anti-cytokine strategy in treating HF, and consider the
synergistic actions of multiple cytokines as a potentially more effective means of ameliorating HF. The
proposed studies will characterize a previously unrecognized role of brain IL-17A in sympathetic activation and
test its potential as a target in treating cardiac dysfunction of HF. Completion of this research project will
provide important insights into the anti-inflammation therapeutic strategy in HF and may carry the implication
for other cardiovascular disorders like hypertension and metabolic diseases like obesity or diabetes."
10756105,"Unique patterns of synaptic connectivity between neurons, and the differential strength of those synapses, are
fundamental to the information processing capability of the brain. Synaptic strength is determine by the number,
composition, and post-translational modifications of post-synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs). These features
of AMPARs are regulated by a host of second messenger pathways, scaffolding proteins, and trafficking proteins
in post-synaptic densities (PSDs). For synapses that display primarily postsynaptic plasticity, the proteins
responsible for regulating AMPAR surface expression are thought to be shared across glutamatergic PSDs.
Thus, it remains unknown whether fundamental differences in synaptic strength between synapses exist due to
unique protein signatures of individual PSDs. Neuron-specific genes (NSG1-3) encode single transmembrane
proteins involved in the secretory trafficking of multiple scaffold and signaling proteins, including postsynaptic
AMPARs. Studies in cultured cells as well as acute hippocampal slice preparations have established that
disrupting NSG1-3 function independently causes severe alterations in basal synaptic activity and plasticity.
Interestingly, our published and preliminary evidence show that NSG1 and NSG2 chronically reside within a
subset of synapses in excitatory hippocampal neurons. In addition, our data show that knockout (KO) of these
proteins differentially affects network function and induces behavioral deficits. This study will be significant
because it will identify whether multiple members of the NSG family are restricted to a unique subpopulation of
excitatory synapses, and confer unique functional properties via the promotion of AMPAR surface expression.
We will use a combination of validated and novel techniques to address these important questions in three
specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. Determine whether NSG proteins define unique population(s) of excitatory synapses.
We will use in vitro time lapse, and ex vivo imaging to determine whether NSG1 and NSG2 are specifically
targeted to a subset of hippocampal synapses or trafficked between them.
Specific Aim 2. Determine whether individual NSG proteins differentially affect synaptic function.
Using physiological recordings and glutamate uncaging we will determine whether NSG1/2 are differentially
involved in promoting surface AMPAR expression during basal or activity-dependent conditions.
Specific Aim 3: Determine whether KO of NSG proteins leads to specific, dissociable behavioral deficits.
Using established and novel behavioral tests in single and double KO mice we will determine whether NSG1/2
proteins play unique or overlapping roles in shaping motor, affective, and cognitive function in live animals."
10896898,"Project Summary
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is defined in the DSM-V as a “problematic pattern of opioid use leading to problems
or distress”. More than 36,000 people overdosed on synthetic opioids including fentanyl in 2019 and, with the
COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a 30% increase in overdose deaths.1,2 Current treatments for OUD
include therapy and medication-assisted treatments (MATs) such as methadone, buprenorphine, and
naltrexone. Naltrexone has low compliance rates and there is stigma associated with the use of methadone
and buprenorphine, as they are opioids used to treat OUD. Access to these drugs, then, is limited, and relapse
rates remain high.3-6,46 Relapse often is precipitated by withdrawal and withdrawal, we hypothesize, is a need
state.7 Thus, as the need for fluid is sated by water, for example, the need for drug (i.e., withdrawal) is sated by
drug. In accordance, we further hypothesized that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a satiety drug, could be
utilized to reduce drug seeking and taking in rodent models of OUD. In support, GLP-1 targeted treatments are
effective in reducing responding for many substances of abuse in rodent models.8,55-56,72 Additionally, we found
that GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) can reduce heroin self-administration, cue-induced heroin seeking,
and drug-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking.9,24 GLP-1RAs also reduce oxycodone taking and seeking.15
Finally, our preliminary data suggest that a GLP-1RA can reduce cue- and drug-induced seeking of not only
heroin, but fentanyl as well (Urbanik et al., in preparation). This finding is consistent with a recent report.13 With
fentanyl contributing to the majority of opioid overdoses1, it is critical that we understand where in the brain
fentanyl is acting and how treatment with a GLP-1RA might mitigate these effects. Here we will use rodent
models, light sheet microscopy, qRT-PCR, and pharmacology to address these questions. For our rodent
model, we will utilize an extended access drug self-administration paradigm.22 We predict that: (1) As with
other drugs of abuse tested,16,22-23 half of the rats tested will be high drug takers and these rats will have higher
cue-induced seeking and greater inhibition of the GLP-1 ‘satiety’ pathway and greater activation of reward
substrates compared to low fentanyl taker/seekers. (2) Fentanyl intake, fentanyl seeking, brain activation
patterns, and gene expression will be attenuated by treatment with the GLP-1RA, liraglutide. (3) The protective
effects of GLP-1RA treatment on behavior and brain will be blocked by the administration of the GLP-1R
antagonist, exendin-9 (Ex-9), directly into the lateral hypothalamus. These hypotheses will be tested across
three specific aims. If our hypotheses are supported, we will have identified the most vulnerable of fentanyl
taking and seeking rats, rescued these subjects from fentanyl seeking via treatment with a GLP-1RA, verified
that fentanyl, particularly in the most vulnerable, inhibits the GLP-1 ‘satiety’ pathway and activates
reward/seeking substrates, and implicated a key role for GLP-1 receptors in the lateral hypothalamus – a
structure critically involved in homeostasis and motivated behavior."
10759390,"Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term goals of this proposal are to explore the protein dimerization interface as an area for therapeutic
intervention. Protein dimerization/oligomerization is a recurring theme in biology representing the mechanism
by which hundreds of proteins regulate key cellular processes such as enzymatic activity and signal transduction.
This non-covalent protein homo- or heterodimerization is mediated by hydrophobicity and both shape and charge
complementarity. Once thought to be undruggable, dimer interfaces are emerging as an area for powerful
therapeutic intervention for inflammatory diseases, pain, genetic diseases, cancer, and other diseases. The goal
of this proposal is to develop a clinically relevant small protein dimerization inhibitor. As a model, we will use
our dimerization coiled-coil (cc) inhibitor of Bcr-Abl. Bcr-Abl is an example of a protein that must dimerize to
enable its oncogenic activity. Bcr-Abl, results from an abnormal chromosomal translocation, manifests as a
constitutively active tyrosine kinase and causes of 95% of chronic myeloid leukemias (CML). We build on our
novel, computationally designed Bcr coiled-coil mutant (ccmut) that selectively dimerizes with Bcr-Abl and inhibits
its activity. When virally delivered as a gene, ccmut is effective against wild-type and mutant forms of Bcr-Abl.
Our ccmut specifically favors heterodimerization with Bcr-Abl to disrupt Bcr-Abl dimerization, a necessary step for
oncogenesis, and thus represents a novel therapeutic strategy. We have also fused ccmut to a non-toxic cell-
penetrating peptide with known leukemia cell specificity and showed that it disrupts Bcr-Abl dimerization and
enters and kills leukemia cells. For this proposal, we will explore peptide stapling technologies (to increase
proteolytic stability) and native chemical ligation to synthesize 2 shorter stapled peptides into a longer therapeutic
protein domain. We will first computationally model possible staple locations that maintain target affinity. These
stapled versions (CPP-St-ccmut) are predicted to enter cells, resist serum proteolysis, bind to Bcr-Abl and inhibit
its activity. We will then test the activity of our constructs with and without TKI ponatinib to test “multidomain
targeting” of Bcr-Abl in CML cell lines, CML patient samples, and a CML animal model. Aims are as follows: Aim
1: Computationally design and synthesize with solid state peptide synthesis and native chemical ligation, a
leukemia-specific, stapled cc inhibitor (CPP-St-ccmut) against Bc-Abl. Aim 2: Determine cell internalization,
binding, and apoptotic ability of CPP-St-ccmut candidates in leukemic cell lines including those with clinically
relevant mutations that are resistant to TKIs, and cells derived from patient samples, alone and in combination
with ponatinib. Aim 3: Demonstrate efficacy of CPP-St-ccmut with and without ponatinib in a simple, pre-clinical
mouse model of CML (syngeneic mouse model using intravenously injected BaF/3 cells expressing drug-
resistant Bcr-Abl variants, including compound mutants). Our goal is to develop a stapled protein domain
targeting the protein-protein dimerization interface Bcr-Abl kinase."
10757661,"Sialylated glycans are involved in complex regulation and signaling and play a critical role in disease.
In the virus life cycle, receptor binding and sialic acid cleavage to facilitate release can compete and
are therefore delicately balanced. While monovalent binding with a single sialylated ligand is weak (KD
~mM), hemagglutinin forms a trimer, which enables multivalent binding. Multivalent binding involving
more than 1 ligand leads to strong binding (KD ~nM). This switch between multivalent and monovalent
binding allows the hemagglutinin to bind to the host with high affinity that is easily reversed following
internalization, replication, by cleavage of only some of the sialylated ligands. Neuraminidase inhibitors
for influenza (Tamiflu, Relenza, and Rapivab) block the neuraminidase cleavage in some infections.
The development of therapeutic strategies to block hemagglutinin binding with small molecule sialylated
inhibitors has been limited. Several analytical barriers to the analysis of sialic acids and sialylated
compounds have challenged research in this area. The long term objective of this project is to bridge
this gap with enabling technology through two key innovations. A new screening approach for enzymes
and receptors is introduced through the use of thermally reversible nanogels. With this new strategy,
the sialic acid structures that interact with enzymes or receptors are identified through capillary
electrophoresis. This work is based on rapid in-line exoglycosidase reactions facilitated with patterned
nanogels. A new capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry interface based on acousto-mechanical
energy is introduced to enable coupling both techniques without concern for voltage or flow rate. Aim
1 creates a new functional screening tool for enzyme inhibition and reduces both the amount of enzyme
and the time to evaluate a neuraminidase preparation. The biocompatibility, automation, and low
reagent and sample requirements are harnessed in Aim 2 to establish a quantitative screening tool to
select and evaluate enzyme inhibition of sialylated structures that interact strongly with the receptor
binding domain of the hemagglutinin protein. The full power of label-free structural identification of
capillary electrophoresis interfaced to mass spectrometry outlined in Aim 3 leverages the
unprecedented gains in signal with electrically assisted vibrational sharp edge ionization, overcoming
barriers of current analytical technologies for the analysis of sialylated glycans. The proposed activities
are significant because the low cost, speed, and automation of the separation-based microscale assays
yield previously unattainable information about sialylation fundamental to mitigating viral infections.
These new tools address challenges associated with chemical analyses of sialylated structures to
leverage the role of sialylation in viral infections; thereby, providing researchers the means to combat
viral diseases and advance human health."
10755661,"Influenza A virus (IAV) is responsible for seasonal epidemics that results in severe respiratory illness and deaths
worldwide, costing billions of dollars annually in the U.S. alone. Cancer patients are at increased risk of
developing a secondary pneumonia after influenza, which can lead to significant complications. Influenza
infections pose serious challenges due to the lack of effective therapeutic interventions, frequent appearances
of new strains of the virus, and rapid development of drug resistance. New approaches to control infection may
stem from cellular factors or pathways that directly or indirectly interact with viral proteins to enhance or inhibit
virus replication. One of the emerging concepts in the field of IAV is that host cellular factors and pathways are
required for maintaining IAV genome integrity, which is essential for viral replication. Our preliminary data show
that a deficiency of a host cellular protein, Bik, is associated with significant reduction in IAV replication. Our
major findings found that Bik deficiency reduces viral protein levels and viral replication in infected airway
epithelial cells. Furthermore, bik-/- compared to bik+/+ mice exhibit less severe lung inflammation, reduced lung
viral load, and a significant increase in survival rate after infection with IAV. Similarly, a single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the BIK gene (G→A) that increases Bik expression levels significantly increases viral NP
level and replication in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs). Furthermore, data from an IAV-
infected human cohort showed that the AA variant of BIK SNP is a risk allele associated with influenza disease
severity. Bik disrupts the interaction of Bcl-2 with IAV-encoded nucleoprotein (NP) and form a Bik/NP complex
that may help assemble viral proteins. The goals of this proposal are to define the role of a host cell protein Bik
in promoting viral replication. Our central hypothesis is that IAV increases host cell Bik protein expression, which
interacts with and disrupts Bcl-2/NP interaction to allow NP to assemble components of viral ribonucleoprotein
(vRNP) and facilitate efficient viral replication. To test this hypothesis, we propose two Specific Aims. Aim 1
identifies the Bik-binding domain of viral NP required for IAV replication. Aim 2 determines whether a
BIK SNP associated with increased Bik expression is a risk factor for influenza disease severity in
humans. Studies are designed to identify the sites of Bik/NP interaction that may serve as potential drug targets
in the future. This study may identify underlying host genetic risk factors contributing to influenza susceptibility
and severity and may have potential implications in regard to targeted prevention and treatment based on
susceptibility factors.
The proposed studies will have significant impacts on the field by dissecting key mechanisms that promote IAV
replication. In the long term, developing peptides or small molecules that disrupt Bik/NP interactions may improve
therapy by reducing IAV replication. Further, this study will identify genetic factors contributing to IAV disease
severity, which can have a broad public health significance."

Treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive decline is a health priority in our aging population and
especially in elderly with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who are at high risk of developing these conditions. Compelling
small scale studies suggest that high dietary and serum levels of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs), a
group of glucose-derived compounds, chronically elevated in T2D, contribute to cognitive impairment and
increased AD and vascular brain pathology in old age. However, there is scarcity of large scale longitudinal
studies of well-characterized older adults with T2D making it difficult to obtain evidence linking dietary and
serum AGEs with impaired cognition in T2D elderly and whether serum AGEs mediate the associations of
dietary AGEs with cognition. These gaps in knowledge impede the development of treatments based on AGEs
to decrease the growing burden of AD and cognitive decline.
To fill these gaps, the overall goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that dietary and circulating AGEs
are related to impaired cognition in T2D elderly through an association with AD-related and cerebrovascular
neuropathologies. To achieve these aims, we will enroll 921 non-demented community-dwelling T2D older
adults from the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline Study (IDCD; R01 AG034087) who undergo annual
cognitive testing. This study proposes a comprehensive assessment of dietary and serum AGEs levels. In 255
IDCD participants we will quantify blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction (using novel contrast-enhanced MRI),
cerebral blood flow (CBF; via ASL-MRI), cerebrovascular reactivity (with Transcranial Doppler), carotid plaque
volume burden (via 3D ultrasound), and amyloid (via PET). This comprehensive large-scale study will 1)
provide evidence that dietary and serum AGEs levels are related to incident dementia and cognitive decline in
older adults with T2D, 2) identify the key neuropathological indices linking dietary and serum AGEs with
cognition and 3) test if serum AGEs mediate the association of dietary AGEs with cognition and
neuropathology. These data are crucial for developing treatments targeting AGEs for late-life T2D-related
cognitive impairment. Thus, these data have the potential to decrease the growing burden of cognitive
impairment and affect the brain health of millions in our aging population."

The University of Cape Town Clinical Trials Unit (UCTCTU) is based at the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre in
Cape Town, South Africa. The CTU’s primary goal is to provide a highly efficient, effective, and integrated
Clinical Trials Unit that contributes to the global epidemic control of HIV and Tuberculosis. The UCTCTU has
the capacity, capability and competence to deliver world standard clinical trials in HIV, tuberculosis, and STI
treatment and prevention in a broad range of populations.
One of the core advantages of the UCTCTU is its location in Southern Africa. Recent reports estimate that
of the 36.9 million people living with HIV globally, 25.7 million are living in sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, the sub-
continent faces significant challenges in delivering treatments and methods of prevention but also stands to
make a significant contribution to innovation and progress. In addition to its key location, the UCTCTU
provides world-class scientific leadership, administrative support, and common infrastructure. This enables
six well-established, diverse Clinical Research Sites to contribute cohesively to the research agenda of the
four NIH funded networks. Each of the Clinical Research Sites are located in communities around Cape Town
where the burden of HIV, tuberculosis and other diseases is high. Thus, the research agenda of the NIH is
being fulfilled in communities where treatment and prevention is needed most.
Based at the University of Cape Town, this CTU is accommodated and supported by an institution that is
consistently ranked the best university in Africa, with a Health Science Faculty recently ranked in the Top
100 globally. All Clinical Research Sites have access to high-quality laboratories, with arguably the finest
scientific expertise and best medical diagnostic and investigative resources in the country. The consortium
of Clinical Research Sites are all components and affiliates of the University of Cape Town and thus share
the same or similar management platforms, supporting and amplifying efficiencies and synergies."
10764902,"This proposal examines how a novel TLR glial signaling pathway drives phagocytic competence in
glia, and defines its function in pruning neuronal number and connectivity across lifespan. Glia
provide an extensive support system for healthy neurons by promoting their survival, connectivity,
and synaptic function. Remarkably, glia can rapidly switch roles to precisely eliminate dying neurons
or unwanted neurites/synapses by phagocytosis. These diametrically opposed functions necessitate
fail-safe signaling mechanisms between neurons and glia; yet hese crucial regulatory mechanisms
have remained largely obscure. Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways were first identified for their roles in
embryonic patterning and have since been defined as a conserved centerpiece of innate immunity.
Our lab made the unexpected discovery that one of the most pronounced phenotypes associated with
loss of a Drosophila TLR, a dramatic increase in the number of apoptotic neurons during
development, is caused by selective loss of the TLR in glia. We demonstrated that release of the TLR
ligand from dying neurons activates a novel TLR pathway in glia to drive phagocytic competence.
In this proposal we build on our novel preliminary findings to establish how this pathway regulates the
speed and specificity of debris clearance, and define its roles in neuron-glia interactions in synapse,
neurite, and neuron removal across lifespan. Our unifying hypothesis is that non-canonical TLR
signaling underlies the speed and specificity of debris clearance critical for proper CNS development
and function. In the first aim, we focus on elucidating how glia are transformed into phagocytes during
development by defining how information is relayed through the TLR pathway to elucidate how glia
are primed to become phagocytic. In the second aim, we seek to extend our published work to
investigate whether TLR signaling is a widespread early detection system to alert glia to the presence
of neuronal debris. And in the third aim, we examine the function of TLR signaling in sculpting circuits
in the olfactory system based on our preliminary findings that glial TLR signaling constrains synapse
number in this well defined circuit. Here we propose to leverage the fly olfactory circuit as a model for
defining glial phagocytic function in synapse maintenance. Together, these studies will shed critical
light on the early signaling interactions between glia and their phagocytic substrates essential for
brain health across lifespan."

This application proposes to continue as the Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) for the HIV
Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN). To meet the statistical and data management goals described in RFA-AI-19-
002, and ultimately to achieve the scientific goal of the HVTN − to develop a safe and globally effective HIV
vaccine − seven specific aims will be addressed: Aim 1, to accomplish all specific aims using high-quality, timely,
cost-efficient, and secure data management and safety monitoring by adhering to clinical data management
standards and regulatory requirements and by using state-of-the-art, CDISC Standards compliant data systems
that enable data exchange and provisioning; Aim 2, to provide innovative statistical/computational biology study
design and data analysis for standardized, phase 1-2a clinical trials that evaluate safety and immunogenicity of
candidate HIV vaccines, including “fast-track” iterative trials to screen vaccines for their ability to elicit broadly
neutralizing antibodies, and that evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunological functions of directly
administered broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs); Aim 3, to support the HVTN Laboratory Center
with data management, statistical methods, and data analysis for developing immunological and virological

including strategies for integrating other HIV prevention modalities into trial designs; Aim 5, to employ novel
quantitative methods for assessing within the phase 2b and 3 efficacy trials correlates of vaccine or mAb
protection, where the correlates are based on markers measuring immune responses to vaccination or mAb
concentration, human immune genetics, and genetic and immunological features of HIV viruses; Aim 6, to adapt
the functions of Aims 1−5 to vaccine or mAb clinical trials of HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants; and Aim
7, to adapt applicable functions of Aims 1−6 for tuberculosis vaccine clinical trials. Novel quantitative
methodologies will be developed in support of the specific aims, to increase the efficiency, rigor, and scientific
impact of the HVTN program. The research will be accomplished in harmonization with the HVTN Leadership
and Operations Core and the HVTN Laboratory Center, and in collaboration with other HIV/AIDS research
networks. Aim 5 encapsulates the HVTN’s research approach to achieving a globally effective HIV vaccine, in
that: (1) Iterative evaluation of refined versions of partially effective vaccine and mAb regimens will be required;
(2) Correlates of vaccine protection are the key scientific tool for driving this iterative evaluation; (3) All Aim 1−4
research activities are ultimately directed toward achieving high-quality correlates of vaccine protection; and (4)
Following licensure of an HIV vaccine, correlates of vaccine protection provide the basis for bridging efficacy to
new populations, hence facilitating widespread vaccination that will be essential for ending the HIV pandemic."
10740904,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adult mammals poorly regenerate injured hearts. In contrast, adult zebrafish possess a remarkable capacity to
regenerate damaged hearts. Combined with available genetic tools, this capacity makes zebrafish a powerful
system for deciphering the mechanisms underlying heart regeneration. Upon injury, the endocardium and
epicardium are rapidly activated to secrete paracrine factors that facilitate heart regeneration. Heart regeneration
research has focused mostly on identifying the secreted factors that trigger regenerative programs, yet little is
known about the regulatory mechanisms controlling their expression, a proximal step in the regenerative process.
Proper spatiotemporal regulation of these genes is essential for the intricate and tightly coordinated processes
underlying cardiac regeneration. Thus, elucidating gene regulatory mechanisms governing injury-responsive
gene expression will provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies based on stimulating paracrine
effectors. Previously, we identified leptin b (lepb) as an injury-induced factor secreted by the endocardium.
Importantly, we showed that the cardiac regeneration enhancer linked to lepb (LEN) is robustly activated by
cardiac injury, maintains activity during regeneration, and then returns to a naïve state upon completion of
regeneration. We also identified a cardiac injury-responsive enhancer linked to interleukin 11a (il11a), which
encodes a proregenerative cytokine structurally similar to lepb. We showed that zebrafish injury-responsive
enhancers drive reporter-gene expression in injured mouse hearts, indicating that the mechanisms mediating
injury-induced enhancer function are evolutionarily conserved. Based on these findings, we propose two aims to
decipher gene regulatory mechanisms governing heart regeneration. The central hypothesis is that cardiac
injury-responsive enhancers establish the transcriptional state of genes encoding paracrine factors that facilitate
heart repair. Aim 1 will determine the transcriptional mechanisms underlying cardiac injury-responsive enhancer
activity. We discovered that cardiac LEN (cLEN) is not only activated by injury but also actively repressed in the
absence of injury. We will employ transgenic assays, genetic and pharmacological approaches, as well as
epigenomic and computational analyses to test the hypothesis that repression and activation mechanisms
collectively determine cardiac injury-responsive enhancer function to confer injury-dependent cardiac gene
transcription. Aim 2 will use loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies to define how il11a controls heart
regeneration and to dissect its injury-responsive enhancer. Elucidating the transcriptional mechanisms and
function of crucial enhancer-regulated factors secreted upon cardiac injury will transform knowledge on how
injury signals are transduced to facilitate heart regeneration."
10756099,"Cilia are microtubule-based cellular protrusions with diverse biological functions, including fluid
movement, cellular locomotion, environmental sensing, and signal transduction. Traditionally,
most cilia are classified based on differences in ciliary ultrastructure, biological function, and ciliary
motility, with primary cilia and motile cilia as the major categories. The primary cilia functions as
solitary sensory hubs to transduce extracellular stimuli into intracellular signaling pathways, and
the motile cilia exhibited coordinated beating to generate directional fluid movement. Choroid
plexus epithelial cells contain multi-sensory cilia that regulate the production of cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) to support neuronal development and physiology. Using serial transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and focus ion beam scanning electron microcopy (FIB-SEM), our preliminary
results suggest that the multi-sensory cilia of choroid plexus represent a distinct type of cilia,
exhibiting unique ultrastructural features, while resembling aspects of both primary cilia and motile
cilia. Defective ciliogenesis in choroid plexus causes hydrocephalus, at least in part, due to CSF
overproduction. Choroid plexus cilia are likely to play an important role in Shh signaling, as FoxJ1
deficient choroid plexus cilia no longer respond to Shh treatment in explant culture. We discovered
a functional connection between Shh signaling and Aqp1 expression. Hence, we hypothesize that
choroid plexus cilia are a unique type of multi-sensory that mediate Shh signaling to regulate CSF
production, at least in part, by regulating the expression of water channels and ion transporters.
Here, using a combined approach of advanced imaging techniques, mouse genetics, imaging
studies, cell biology and molecular biology, we propose to study the ciliary ultrastructures,
ciliogenesis mechanisms and biological functions of the multi-sensory cilia of choroid plexus. First,
using electron microscopy, FIB-SEM and super-resolution imaging, we will characterized the
ultrastructure of choroid plexus cilia, and define their developmental dynamics at different
developmental stages. Second, we will employ mouse genetics and genomics studies to identify
and characterize the ciliogenesis machineries of choroid plexus cilia. Finally, we will elucidate the
molecular mechanisms through which dynamic choroid plexus cilia mediate the Shh signaling to
regulate CSF production. Taken together, the proposed studies will structurally and functionally

10852815,"Food insecurity (FI), the lack of consistent access to food, is a public health crisis that affects over 6 million
children in the US each year. FI predicts maladaptive outcomes in every domain of child development with
long-lasting life and health consequences, but we do not know how and why FI carries negative effects. To
establish effective public health initiatives to address FI, we must understand how it works to undermine
development, and identify which aspects of FI may be sensitive to intervention. FI increases parental mental
health problems, stress, and harsh parenting practices in a way that likely contributes to FI’s detrimental effects
on child well-being, but mechanistic details about the association are uncertain. It is assumed that FI works
primarily through parents to influence children, but due to measurement and methodological limitations of
current research, that pathway is unclear. It is possible that parental depression limits parents’ ability to secure
food in ways that lead to FI, or that FI affects child behavior directly, which leads to changes in parent mood
and behavior. Isolating which of these patterns is occurring, or which is occurring for whom and when, will
inform which members of the family and community to target for food assistance programs. Further, the time
course over which the relationship between FI and parent and child well-being operates has not been carefully
characterized. FI has only been examined over long time periods, like years, so we do not know how quickly
negative effects emerge. Understanding how FI works across shorter timelines, such as weeks and days, and
if that time course varies by FI type, will allow us to understand the ways in which frequently experienced gaps
in food assistance impact children in real time. The planned research will apply innovative methods to study
the relationship between FI and parent and child well-being, presenting results to craft public health
interventions that target the most promising set of solutions. The training plan described in this proposal will
provide me with foundational knowledge in stress physiology and biomarkers, as well as the methodological
and quantitative techniques necessary to address the following key questions about the link between FI and
parent and child well-being: 1) What is the directionality of the relationships between FI and parent and child
well-being? and 2) Over what time scale do effects emerge and sustain? In the proposed study, I will leverage
new conceptual, methodological, and statistical training to address these gaps in understanding, using a
within-person approach with daily repeated measures of FI and parent and child well-being. In addition, training
in stress physiology will prepare me to explore, in the future, how physiological effects of FI contribute to the
impact of FI on parent and child well-being. This post-doctoral fellowship will provide me further training in
domains necessary for launching my career as an independent researcher. Further, the results of this proposal
will help shape this translational science on a highly significant public health threat to millions of children’s
immediate and longer-term health and development."
10540809,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The rapid increase in the criminal justice population has important health implications for justice-
involved individuals, their families and communities with the most vulnerable populations at greater risk. A
recent review found elevated mortality among those released from prison relative to the general population,
suggesting that incarceration may have lasting consequences even after individuals return to the community.
The implications for health disparities are crucial given that some groups (e.g. African Americans, Native
Americans) have higher rates of incarceration and experience excess mortality relative to Whites. Yet, we have
little understanding of the degree to which criminal justice exposure elevates mortality risk and whether this
relationship is stronger among minority groups. This study will provide rigorous quasi-experimental
evidence on how criminal justice exposure influences mortality and disparities using longitudinal data from
a statewide census of arrestees assigned to prison, jail, community supervision, or released.
 Our study leverages a natural policy experiment in a difference-in-difference design with propensity score
weighting and instrumental variables combined with rare comprehensive data on criminal history and
mortality. South Dakota's Public Safety Improvement Act of 2013 (hereafter, SB70) reduced prison sentences,
increased assignment to probation, re-classified felony offenses to lower severity classes, and allowed those on
community supervision to earn reductions in time on supervision. Essentially, those arrested post-SB70 were
subject to different penalties and supervision relative to those arrested pre-SB70 for the same offenses, based
only on timing. Our study utilizes this policy experiment for the exogenous variation needed to assess the
relationship between criminal justice exposure and mortality. An intrinsic aspect is to assess disparities by
race/ethnicity and sex with a unique opportunity to provide evidence on Native Americans. For this project, we
have obtained criminal history data on all 202,594 arrestees (2000-2019) as well as matched mortality records.
 In summary, this study will provide much-needed evidence on excess mortality among arrestees
sentenced to prison, jail, community supervision or released overall and by demographic group; assess whether
SB70 influenced the risk, timing and causes of mortality overall and by demographic group; and finally,
estimate how criminal justice exposure influenced the risk, timing and causes of mortality overall and by
demographic group. Understanding how exposure to the criminal justice system influences mortality is
particularly policy-relevant given the mass incarceration in the US and states' efforts to reduce its impact on
budgets and society. Disparities in criminal justice exposure mirror disparities in mortality, suggesting that the
two phenomena may be intertwined. Thus, this study is not simply an evaluation of SB70, but rather a quasi-
experimental assessment of the impact of criminal justice exposure on public health and health disparities."
10764259,"Background: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are common, debilitating, and costly complications of diabetes. Those
with a history of ulceration are at high risk of future ulcerations -- about 40% of patients experience another
ulcer within a year of ulcer healing and 65% within 5 years. DFU and amputation disproportionately impact
individuals who are Black and rural. One proposed reason for the higher ulceration and amputation rates in
these groups is that they present for care later in the course of illness with ulcers that are more difficult to treat
conservatively. Identifying equitable approaches to early detection and treatment could help. Elevated
temperatures that are sustained over several days are an early sign of inflammation and can effectively predict
ulceration. Several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that daily plantar temperature monitoring using
handheld thermometers along with a protocol that instructed patients to reduce activity and be seen by a
clinician, reduced the risk of ulceration. Yet adoption was poor because the procedures were burdensome.
New technologies are much easier, and only require patients to place their feet on a mat for 20 seconds.
Temperature data can now be measured in the patient’s home and analyzed to identify hot spots. A prior study
and our own analyses have demonstrated that patients stand on the mat as directed with high compliance.
Significance: The only evidence that remote temperature monitoring (RTM) reduces the risk of ulceration and
amputation comes from a small observational study (n=77) conducted outside the VA, that used a pre-post
design. There have been no randomized trials that have evaluated effectiveness or costs/cost-savings for
different at-risk Veterans. Also, no prior studies have evaluated any patient-reported outcomes, or interviewed
patients or providers, which will be important to understand and address barriers to implementation and
dissemination, should RTM be demonstrated to be effective. The substantial upfront cost ($3400 per patient
per year) has prompted some leaders to call for more rigorous data in VA.
Innovation and Impact: Widescale remote biometric monitoring involving private-public partnerships will play
a major role in the future of healthcare. Our study will be the first large, randomized controlled trial to evaluate
effectiveness of RTM embedded in a healthcare system. This study will inform how VA can work with private
companies to enhance the health and well-being of Veterans.
Specific Aims: The specific aims of this study are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of RTM vs. usual care in
terms of primary (ulceration) and secondary outcomes (severity of ulceration, amputation, hospitalization,
emergency room visits, quality of life, satisfaction with care, and patient activation) at 12, 18, and 24 months; 2)
Collect data on costs of RTM and compare with usual care costs, if effectiveness is demonstrated; and 3)
Evaluate the implementation process, including barriers and facilitators to use among key stakeholders using
the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to guide data collection and analysis.
Methodology: To accomplish Aim 1, we will conduct a 3-site randomized controlled study. Patients (n=406)
who have had a DFU or amputation within the past 24 months (including active ulcers) will be randomized 1:1
to RTM or usual care (no RTM), with randomization stratified on race, rurality, and active ulcer vs. not. To
accomplish Aim 2, we will collect data to conduct a budget impact analysis that will evaluate costs of RTM,
which include the mats; provider time for selecting patients, ordering mats, and responding to alerts of “hot
spots”; and utilization (ulcer/amputation-related outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room visits). Finally, to
accomplish Aim 3, we will conduct observations of, and interviews with stakeholders to understand barriers
and facilitators to implementation of RTM.
Next steps: Findings from this study will be used to inform effective, efficient, and equitable scaling of RTM in
VA."

The Rabb-Venable Excellence in Ophthalmology Research Program (RV) was started by
Lenworth Johnson, MD (past NEI council member) at the 2000 annual meeting of the National
Medical Association (NMA), Ophthalmology Section. (The National Medical Association,
founded in 1895 when segregation barred Blacks from membership in the American Medical
Association, is the collective voice of African American physicians and has a very active
Ophthalmology Section.) The program is named for Maurice F. Rabb, Jr. MD and Howard P.
Venable, MD in honor of their prolific support of underrepresented minorities (URM) pursuing
careers in academic ophthalmology. RV has been funded by the National Eye Institute (NEI)
since 2008. The goal of RV is to increase the number of under-represented minority physicians
in ophthalmology and academic medicine. The program is a pipeline process to expose medical
students and resident/fellows to role models, skills needed in medical practice and teaching,
research opportunities and to provide mentoring. The program started out as a forum where
residents and medical students submitted research abstracts and had the opportunity to
present their paper or poster at the NMA annual meeting. Over the years, it has expanded to
include a session with a communications specialist who coaches them on their presentations
and interview skills, development of a peer-to-peer mentorship program, and a series of
meetings (the Fireside Chat series) where residency program directors interact with our
students right before interview season. Students and residents may remain in the program
throughout their training and form a network that has career-long benefits. Since 2008, of the
Rabb-Venable medical students who have applied for ophthalmology residency, over 80% have
matched. Program participants have become academicians in top tier ophthalmology
departments, successful private practitioners and entrepreneurs. In the American Academy of
Ophthalmology membership, of the 64 African American ophthalmologists who list academia as
their primary practice, 36 are Rabb-Venable alumni."
10760212,"Project Summary/Abstract
 This proposal describes our program focused on the development of novel chemical reactions for complex
molecule synthesis, innovative strategies for molecule synthesis, and the application of these reactions and
strategies to antimicrobial natural products
 The objective of the proposed research is to develop a scalable and expedient approach to several bioactive
natural product families and leverage the synthetic work to develop new chemical probes and lead compounds
for therapeutic development. We have developed several programs in this regard over our previous 5 years of
NIH support and are excited to expand our efforts while advancing our existing projects to the next level. Of
particular interest to date are polycyclic guanidine, oxazolidinone, curvulamines and absyssomicins to explore
antimicrobial and/or anti-biofilm activity.
 We expect that our synthetic work will provide new reactions to construct molecules of broad utility and lead
to approaches to natural products that enable their use as chemical probes. These synthetic studies are
complimented by in-house chemical biology studies to explore the activity and mechanism of both natural
products and analogs against clinically relevant diseases. Taken together, these efforts will provide a framework
for the development of new synthetic chemistry and potential lead compounds for the treatment of bacterial
infections as well as other diseases as new activity is uncovered."
10793470,"ABSTRACT
Remarkable clinical responses have been reported in B-cell malignancies by adoptive transfer of T cells
redirected with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for the CD19 antigen. However, developing CAR-Ts
for the treatment of solid tumors including ovarian cancer (OC) is challenging because: (1) OC-associated
antigens that are targetable by CAR-Ts are limited, generally not exclusively expressed by OC, and act as
passengers, not as drivers of tumorigenesis, allowing for antigenic drift; (2) OC tumor microenvironment (TME)
is highly immunosuppressive. In this proposal we aim at solving these critical issues. We have identified B7-H3
(CD276) as a suitable target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in OC. B7-H3 is a tumor-promoting
transmembrane protein aberrantly expressed in 60% to 93% of pancreatic cancer, melanoma, leukemia,
breast, prostate and OC, while limited expression is seen on normal healthy tissues. We have developed and
tested B7-H3.CAR-Ts in xenogeneic and immunocompetent tumor models showing antitumor activity is
several tumor models including OC and safety. Thus in Aim 1 we propose to conduct a phase I clinical study in
patients with OC to assess safety and antitumor activity of autologous B7-H3.CAR-Ts inoculated
intraperitoneally. An IND (IND19641) for this study has been obtained at University of North Carolina, and
clinical grade reagents to manufacture B7-H3.CAR-Ts are in hands. In Aim 2 we propose to conduct a
comprehensive immunologic analysis of tumor biopsies and ascites collected from patients enrolled in the
study before and after treatment to assess antigen loss and immunologic perturbation of the TME in OC. In
Aim 3, we propose to reprogram tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells
(MDSC) of the OC TME to a non-immunosuppressive state by using potent and orally bioavailable TAM RTK
small molecule inhibitors developed at University of North Carolina (IND128236). We will thus perform
preclinical studies to evaluate whether TAM RTK signaling inhibition in macrophages and MDSC would favor
the antitumor activity of B7-H3.CAR-Ts in a syngeneic model of OC. If successful, this strategy will be included
into a second phase of the proposed Phase I clinical study with B7-H3.CAR-Ts."
10758827,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Prostate cancer (PCa) is particularly important in elderly men because of the high incidence and
prevalence of disease and mortality in this group of patients. Although the case-fatality rate of PCa is quite low,
deaths occur disproportionately in the elderly. However, the reasons for the increased incidence and mortality
due to PCa in elderly men are not entirely clear. Low-grade inflammation (i.e., inflammaging) plays an
important role in the aging process, and chronic inflammation contributes to the onset and progression of PCa.
Inflammaging is often attributed to the progressive activation of immune cells. In that regard, a disruption in the
balance of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and homeostatic regulatory T (Treg) cells in favor of Th17 cells was
reported previously to occur in non-cancer-related aging in humans and mice. Preliminary data support that
elderly human prostate tissue had increased Th17/Treg ratio and the similar phenomenon was found in aged
mice circulation and prostate tissue, and CD4+ T cell secreted factors from aged mice compared to young mice
promote PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The long-term goal is to contribute toward the
development of novel clinically useful strategies to treat or prevent PCa associated with advanced aging. The
overall objective in this proposal is to determine how age-related Th17/Treg imbalance contributes to prostate
carcinogenesis. The central hypothesis is that age-related disruption of Th17/Treg axis promotes PCa initiation
and progression. The rationale for the proposed research is that a determination of how Th17/Treg imbalance
promotes prostate carcinogenesis is likely to provide new opportunities for the subsequent development of
targeted therapeutics to the prevention/treatment of prostate cancers associated with advanced aging. Guided
by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify
associations between Th17/Treg ratio alteration and progression of human PCa associated with advanced
aging. 2) Define how aging-associated imbalances in Th17/Treg axis drive PCa. 3) Determine the efficacy of
therapeutic targeting of Th17/Treg axis in preventing aging-associated PCa. In aim 1, the expression of
Th17/Treg and NF-kB will be examined in human normal and PCa specimens at different ages. In aim 2, the
Batf and Pten (tumor suppressor gene) double knockout mouse model generated at different ages will be used
to assess whether Batf status and age plays a critical role in PCa initiation and progression. In aim 3, the anti-
IL-23p19 antibody and small molecule SR1555 (both suppress Th17/stimulate Treg function) will be tested.
The approach is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because the tumor growth can be compared in the same
time interval post-Pten excision between the aged and non-aged mice. The proposed research is significant,
as the concept is novel and has clinical significance because rectifying Th17/Treg imbalance has the potential
to be developed into prognostic indicator of PCa and therapeutics in the prevention and treatment of PCa in
the elderly."
10761698,"The proposed studies will use new biosensors and novel chemogenetic approaches to identify the molecular
mechanisms whereby reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathways in the
vascular endothelium. The proposed studies build on recent work in which we used chemogenetics to develop
a new animal model of cardiomyopathy caused by oxidative stress. Here we plan to expand this chemogenetic
approach to develop a new experimental program to study endothelial dysfunction and hypertension.
 Many studies have implicated oxidative stress in endothelial dysfunction and hypertension, yet the underlying
molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Low levels of the stable ROS hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
modulate NO-dependent physiological responses, while higher ROS levels are associated with hypertension.
The proposed experiments exploit recent advances in chemogenetic and biosensor technologies to identify the
mechanisms underlying the transition from physiological H2O2 signaling to the development of hypertension and
other vascular disease states associated with pathological oxidative stress. We will pursue multispectral imaging
experiments that will simultaneously analyze H2O2, NO and Ca2+ using highly selective and sensitive HyPer7,
geNOp, and GECO biosensors. These studies will establish the mechanisms whereby purinergic P2Y2 receptors
modulate H2O2-, Ca2+-, and NO-dependent endothelial responses that control blood pressure.
 Hemodynamic shear stress leads to eNOS activation and to increases in endothelial ROS that can promote
both physiological as well as pathophysiological responses. We found that physiological laminar shear stress
preferentially increases H2O2 in the endothelial cell nucleus, while pathological oscillatory shear stress increases
H2O2 more in the cell cytosol. We used a chemogenetic approach to generate H2O2 in endothelial cells, using
novel recombinant constructs expressing a yeast D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) that robustly produces H2O2.
The recombinant yeast DAAO is quiescent since vascular cells contain L- but not D-amino acids. H2O2 can be
generated by adding D-alanine to cells expressing recombinant DAAO. Our studies showed that H2O2 generated
in the endothelial cell nucleus activates Nrf2-modulated transcripts, whereas generation of H2O2 in the cytosol
principally increases NF-kB-dependent transcripts. These differential transcriptional responses establish a
causal role for H2O2 and provide a strong connection between chemogenetic approaches and endothelial
pathophysiology. Studying in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models, we propose to extend these studies from cultured
human endothelial cells (Aim 1) to the investigation of arterial preparations and transgenic mice expressing
DAAO in the endothelium (Aim 2). This experimental program may lead to the development of a new
“chemogenetic” animal model of hypertension. These studies will use powerful new cell imaging approaches to
test the hypothesis that perturbations in intracellular H2O2 metabolism modulate endothelial responses both in
the normal vasculature and in hypertension, and in other vascular disease states caused by oxidative stress."
10775723,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to all terminally differentiated cells in the blood. The ability of HSCs
to reconstitute these blood cell lineages for life underlies the efficacy of bone marrow transplantation therapy
for treatment of various blood disorders, including leukemias, anemia, and autoimmunity. Although this is an
established and effective treatment, two-thirds of patients in need of a transplant lack a matched donor.
Therefore, alternative sources of therapeutic HSCs would be a boon to the field. Human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs) represent a potential source for cell-based therapies, including the derivation of patient-specific
transplantable HSCs, which would additionally circumvent immune rejection and alloreactivity, both major
issues in the clinic.
The goal of the proposed research is to extend our preliminary observations on a novel population of somite-
derived endothelial cells (SDECs). Of note, these cells migrate exclusively to the nascent dorsal aorta and act
as a developmental niche for the subsequent emergence of HSCs. Characterization of SDECs will provide a
deeper understanding of the cues that govern HSC development in vivo. The fundamental discoveries made
in the course of these studies will ultimately inform derivation strategies of HSCs from hPSCs. This proposal
will leverage lineage tracing methods in zebrafish and in vitro differentiation protocols of hPSCs combined with
single-cell sequencing approaches to determine the molecular mechanisms of this requirement, and to provide
a new level of understanding of how posterior lateral mesoderm is instructed to generate HSCs.
The long-term goal of these studies is to gain a better understanding of how HSCs develop in the embryo in
order to translate this information to hPSCs. Successful completion of this research will have a profound
impact on HSC derivation and expansion, and thereby will be instrumental in overcoming current obstacles to
the effective treatment of diseases requiring bone marrow transplant therapy."
10534888,"Bone fractures are painful injuries that disproportionally affect Veterans. Emerging evidence suggests that the
intestinal microbiota is a significant regulator of inflammatory, neuropathic, and visceral pain through production
of neuroactive metabolites and inflammatory mediators. However, the contribution of the gut microbiome to pain
following traumatic bone injuries has remained unexplored. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to
establish the gut microbiota as a therapeutic target to modulate the inflammatory pain response to and
throughout fracture healing. Our central hypothesis posits that the intestinal microbiota is a critical regulator of
pain following fracture through inflammatory signals and production of neuroactive metabolites, and that dietary
supplementation with probiotics will alleviate pain during fracture healing. We first propose to assess post-
fracture pain and function in mice with a depleted microbiome achieved through a broad-spectrum antibiotic
cocktail, and whether dietary supplementation with probiotics will improve these outcomes (Aim 1). The
indigenous microbiota and probiotics produce a variety of neuroactive metabolites that influence host metabolism
and may contribute to pain sensitization and desensitization during bone healing. We will characterize the role
of the intestinal microbiota in metabolic flexibility after fractures using serum metabolomics and metabolic
phenotyping studies (Aim 2). Together the proposed experiments will determine whether the gut microbiota is a
valid therapeutic target for managing pain during recovery from fractures.
The candidate’s long-term career goal is to become an independent VA investigator with a research focus on
identifying nutrition-based approaches to improve patient outcomes and quality of life while also enhancing
healing of orthopaedic injuries. The award of a CDA-1 will enable the PI to leverage his cumulative expertise and
gain new skills in the assessment of pain, function, as well as cell and tissue metabolism to develop novel, yet
easily implemented approaches aimed at improving the quality of life of Veterans suffering from painful
musculoskeletal injuries and ailments. The proposed work will be completed using a comprehensive training
plan under the guidance of an experienced, multidisciplinary mentoring team consisting of VA investigators. This
will include recurring meetings with the mentoring team and hands-on training in metabolomics and behavioral
assessments of pain and function. The planned innovative research will advance the understanding of the
interconnectedness between the gut microbiota, pain, and metabolism following common traumatic bone injuries
experienced by Veterans. This may lead to new treatments that decrease the reliance on harmful pain-relieving
pharmacological drugs throughout the post-fracture recovery period. This CDA-1 project complements his prior
dissertation work that focused on the inflammatory and gut microbiota influences on fracture healing. The
proposed research plan, outstanding institutional environment, and experienced mentoring team will provide the
necessary skills and experiences to become a successful VA-based independent investigator."
10755257,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is spread through saliva, infects oropharyngeal tissues including the tonsillar epithelium,
and establishes life-long latency in the B-cell compartment in over 95% of the global adult human population.
The oral transmission of EBV can result in infectious mononucleosis and can lead to several B-cell and epithelial
cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma. This frequently presents as craniofacial and nasopharyngeal carcinomas.
EBV uses both latent and lytic phases of its replication cycle to colonize the oropharynx and tonsils. Reactivation
from latency is closely tied to EBV pathogenicity; however, the mechanisms that maintain latency and regulate
reactivation in tonsillar memory B-cells and in EBV-associated diseases remain incompletely understood.
Because EBV can evade immune detection while latent, most currently available therapies cannot harness the
presence of the latent EBV genome. Developing a detailed understanding of the switch from latency to lytic
reactivation may lay the foundation for lytic induction therapeutic strategies. One of the challenges to
understanding the EBV lytic switch is to define the host factors necessary for maintaining EBV latency and how
these factors are circumvented by EBV to allow reactivation. To begin to address this question, a human
CRISPR/Cas9 screen was performed in Burkitt B-cells that were originally derived from a craniofacial biopsy. It
showed that knockout of the human nuclear protein splicing factor proline and glutamine rich (SFPQ) strongly
induces EBV lytic reactivation. SFPQ binds both DNA and RNA and is known to regulate both transcription and
RNA splicing. Thus, SFPQ is poised as a master regulator of human and viral gene expression and viral genomic
conformation during EBV latency. The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that SFPQ suppresses
EBV lytic reactivation in both DNA- and RNA- dependent manners and that EBV relieves this suppression
by redistributing SFPQ to paraspeckles. Aim 1 is to determine the mechanism by which SFPQ represses EBV
lytic reactivation. Aim 2 is to define the factors that mediate SFPQ subnuclear redistribution and function upon
lytic reactivation. Molecular virology, transcriptomic, genomic, and microscopy approaches will be integrated to
test this hypothesis. Understanding how SFPQ regulates the EBV and host genomes during latency and how
SFPQ responds during lytic reactivation will contribute to a fundamental knowledge gap in how EBV subverts
host factors to colonize oropharyngeal tissues and the B-cell compartment. This study may lay the foundation
for lytic induction therapeutic strategies. The Brigham and Women’s Hospital at Harvard Medical School will
provide an environment rich in both physical and intellectual resources for completion of this training.
Furthermore, working with Dr. Gewurz in the collaborative atmosphere of his lab will enhance training in multi-
disciplinary approaches to study EBV-host interactions. Altogether, this is an excellent environment for scientific
training for development towards running an independent research program."

With our ethnically and socioeconomically diverse longitudinal twin study, in this competing continuation we
aim to understand the genetic and environmental mechanisms linking sleep and physical health across
pubertal development. We also elucidate mechanisms accounting for longitudinal associations between these
health processes and both mental health and inflammation in adolescence. Further, we examine a key
proximal sociocultural process - daily media use - which is pervasive in the everyday lives of adolescents. With
inflammation and mental health problems on the rise among youth, it is imperative that we utilize a well-
powered (N=700 twin youth), representative (recruited from birth records), genetically-informed (twin study),
longitudinal (followed since infancy with proposed assessments at 12 and 14 years) design to identify risk and
resilience processes across the major transition from childhood to adolescence. To date, our results suggest
that sleep is linked with cognition and health for genetic rather than environmental reasons (see C1),
suggesting that third variables are involved that may vary by development (puberty). More specifically, we add
two follow ups of a diverse twin sample recruited from birth records and assessed at 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 10 & 11
years (N=700 youth; Arizona Twin Project). At 12 years, we add new assessments of the environment (e.g.
media use) and extend our objective measures of sleep and health (aerobic, muscular, adiposity, physiology).
At age 14, we add new outcome assessments (inflammatory biomarkers, mental health). Under Aim 1, we use
parallel process growth models from childhood into adolescence to determine direction of effects among
puberty, sleep, and multiple indicators of health. Under Aim 2, we dynamically extend this work by using
intercepts and growth parameters from the parallel process growth models outlined in Aim 1 to predict
inflammation and mental health at age 14. Under Aim 3, we examine the genetic and environmental overlap
among puberty, sleep, and health and pinpoint aspects of the environment that play a role in health. Such an
examination is critical as our work has shown that common risk factors and health are often associated for
genetic as opposed to environmental reasons which can shift the focus of potential interventions. Under Aim 4,
we disentangle genetic and environmental contributions to associations between daily sociocultural contexts,
sleep and health. The proposed study builds on existing collaborations with complementary expertise. The
project is notable as it is the only twin sample of youth to obtain longitudinal objective sleep, health, and
sociocultural context data, for its developmental cultural and genetic approach that uncovers gene-environment
interplay, measurement of physiological and inflammation biomarkers, and examination of proximal
sociocultural processes including objective media use in adolescence. Combining these design features
exponentially increases the scientific contribution, elucidating processes that support preventive intervention
efforts."
10864797,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Asthma impacts more than 25 million adults and children in the U.S. with high associated morbidity and
socioeconomic disparities in outcomes. Because effective medications are available to treat and prevent
exacerbations of asthma and evidence-based interventions exist to mitigate the impact of harmful
socioeconomic factors, early identification of those at highest risk is crucial. However, efforts to predict future
exacerbations of asthma have yielded modest results with infrequent inclusion of comprehensive information
on social hardships, such as food insecurity and housing instability, or financial hardships, such as difficulty
affording the costs of controller medications which is particularly relevant for those with private health
insurance. Identifying social and financial hardships requires broad-based screenings which are resource
intensive, difficult to implement in clinical settings and often incomplete or limited to care seeking populations.
Further, few asthma risk prediction modalities incorporate time-variable (temporal) data on important social,
clinical, and environmental factors. Machine learning, an advanced computational approach to risk prediction,
has great potential to improve upon conventional approaches to risk prediction of asthma exacerbations
through indirect estimation of social hardships and inclusion of temporal risk factors. Implementation of
enhanced asthma risk-prediction models in a health plan setting offers distinct advantages due to existing
investments in asthma care management and access to timely claims data across the full care continuum.
Accordingly, the aims of the SPACER study (Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room
visits) are 1) To describe social and financial hardships in privately insured adults and children with asthma,
and association with medication adherence and exacerbations, 2) To indirectly estimate self-reported social
and financial hardships using routinely collected health plan and spatial data, and 3) To develop and validate a
machine learning network model, incorporating temporal sociomarker, clinical, and environmental data, to
predict asthma exacerbations in a health plan setting. The research leverages the unique research
environment of the Department of Population Medicine, an academic research department of Harvard Medical
School, situated in a regional non-profit health plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The mentored career
development award will support Dr. Alon Peltz, a physician and health services researcher, in developing
expertise in machine learning modeling and use of social data to improve prediction of adverse clinical
outcomes."
10729519,"Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major public health concern with significant negative
consequences for those who experience it and wide-ranging impact on children, families, and the healthcare
system. However, IPV is an especially prevalent health issue for Veterans, who are at increased risk of both
experiencing and perpetrating IPV. More than one out of three women Veterans experience IPV and up to 60%
of Veteran men report IPV perpetration. Although VHA currently recommends routine screening of IPV
experiences among women Veterans, no guidelines or instruments currently exist for IPV perpetration
screening. Moreover, effective intervention development for IPV perpetration is in its infancy with no evidence-
based individual treatment available for IPV perpetration. In order to improve Veterans' health and reduce rates
of IPV, effective and acceptable screening and treatment for IPV perpetration must exist.
Significance/Impact: IPV perpetration detection, followed by behavioral intervention, are urgently needed for
IPV cessation and improved health of Veterans with these common presenting problems. Yet there has been
little progress to develop tools and procedures for IPV perpetration, and no guidelines on best practices for IPV
perpetration screening or treatment exist. The findings of the proposed research will improve the health and
functioning of Veterans and their families, enhance much needed healthcare response for this population, and
inform VHA national efforts for IPV response among Veterans.
Innovation: This project is innovative in its focus on IPV perpetration. With the majority of IPV research
focusing on IPV victimization, there is currently a significant gap in knowledge related to IPV perpetration,
including limited tools and procedures with which to address perpetration of IPV among Veterans. Enhancing
services for those who experience IPV is essential, but insufficient. In order to reduce and prevent IPV, a
comprehensive healthcare response necessitates implementing validated screening to detect IPV perpetration
among Veterans and developing intervention protocols to address IPV perpetration. Completion of the CDA
research aims will provide VHA with the data and tools necessary to inform IPV efforts, practices, and policy.
Aims: The primary objective of this research is to decrease IPV among Veterans. To do so, we must have
effective and acceptable tools and protocols. Aim 1: Evaluate the psychometric properties and cut-scores of a
previously developed IPV screening tool. Aim 2: Identify an effective IPV perpetration intervention process and
essential treatment components and develop an intervention manual. Aim 3: Conduct a pilot study of the IPV
perpetration manualized intervention in a sample of Veterans.
Methodology: For Aim 1, we will calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and
positive and negative likelihood ratios of the screening instrument in comparison to the reference standard in a
sample of [male] Veterans (n=113). To achieve Aim 2, we will a) engage in a consensus process with IPV
experts to select intervention components from four pre-existing treatment models; b) solicit Veterans’
feedback through focus group discussions (n=4 focus groups); and c) refine the intervention, develop
intervention manual, and present manual to stakeholders. For Aim 3, we will use a pre-post design to assess
feasibility, safety, acceptability, and satisfaction (primary outcomes) and patient- and partner-reported changes
on indicators of psychosocial health (secondary outcomes) among Veterans (n=20).
Next Steps/Implementation: Research proposed in this CDA will provide the necessary groundwork for
developing and implementing screening and intervention for IPV perpetration among Veterans, a critical need
in VA care. Completion of these aims will inform an IIR proposal, to further evaluate and implement VHA's IPV
perpetration response. Specifically, I will use findings from the CDA to refine the manualized IPV perpetration
intervention, which I will then test in a larger Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial."

Cancer immunotherapy has been a revolutionary antitumor treatment and is approved to treat a plethora of
cancer types. However, in solid tumors the response has been limited with only approximately 20 percent of
patients responding except for patients with high tumor burden as evidenced by microsatellite instability (MSI)
or mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD). The limited response is especially pronounced for prostate cancer. In
prostate cancer, the only currently approved therapy (except for MSI/MMRD patients) is sipuleucel-T, a
dendritic cell vaccine. Sipuleucel-T activates antigen presenting cells ex vivo before reinfusion where in vivo
activation of B and T cell responses are associated with response to the therapy. This immunogenic myeloid
and lymphoid cell interaction is just one example of a plethora of interactions which can be either immunogenic
or tolerogenic. Improved understanding of the role of myeloid compartment in pro- or anti-tumor activity will
allow for improved targeting of the myeloid compartment in combination immunotherapy strategies.
Immunosuppressive myeloid states can be observed both in the periphery and in the tumor microenvironment.
Peripheral monitoring of the immune system holds incredible potential due to the ease of monitoring and the
ability for longitudinal repeated sampling. To characterize the heterogeneity of the circulating myeloid
compartment, I used a genetic multiplexing strategy to simultaneously profile gene and protein expression
on single cells from ~700,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from longitudinal sampling
of a metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) cohort undergoing combined
immunotherapy. In my first aim, I propose to use this dataset to describe novel myeloid cell states in the
periphery and to investigate which states recapitulate in the tumor microenvironment and which states predict
clinical response to the immunotherapy. In my second aim, I will investigate how these myeloid cell states
interact with the lymphoid compartment to create an immunogenic or tolerogenic tumor response. My sponsor,
Dr. Jimmie Ye, has extensive expertise in single cell –omics for profiling the immune system in both auto-
immune and tumor contexts. My co-sponsor, Dr. Lawrence Fong, has made foundational discoveries in the
field of cancer immunotherapy with a particular focused on the mechanisms behind response to cancer
immunotherapy in genitourinary cancers, including prostate cancer. My co-sponsor, Dr. Matthew Spitzer, has
extensive expertise in the understanding the systemic response of the immune system to a tumor with a
particular focus in using mass cytometry for high dimensional single cell protein expression profiling. I will be
undergoing longitudinal clinical training in cancer immunotherapy with Dr. Lawrence Fong, who is the director
of the Cancer Immunotherapy Program at UCSF. Overall, this work will lay the foundation for improved
prediction of response to cancer immunotherapy and the identification of novel targets within the myeloid target
to improve clinical response in solid tumors."

Cancer cells by definition are highly proliferative and grow rapidly. In general, the higher the proliferation rate,
the more aggressive the tumor tends to be. To maintain the high proliferation rate, membrane choline
phospholipid metabolism is upregulated to provide cellular biomass for accelerated growth and maintain
viability, which causes changes in the content of both membrane choline phospholipids and their metabolites.
Therefore, the content of these molecules have strong association with tumor aggressiveness. To improve the
prognosis and treatment-monitoring of cancer, it is highly desirable to have a molecular and metabolic imaging
approach to reveal the choline phospholipids and their metabolism. However, although several invasive
techniques have been previously developed to study choline phospholipids, there are no methods to date that
can assess choline phospholipids and their metabolism in vivo with high sensitivity. Chemical exchange
saturation transfer (CEST) MRI is an emerging molecular imaging method with much higher sensitivity than
MRS. Recently, we have noticed an in vivo NOE-mediated saturation transfer signal at -1.6 ppm from water,
termed NOE(-1.6), which also decrease in tumors. Phantom studies on major tissue components suggest that
it is from choline phospholipids. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that (1) the NOE(-1.6) is a
saturation transfer effect via dipolar interactions between phospholipid choline head group and water; (2) the
reduced NOE(-1.6) signal in tumor is due to the reduced choline phospholipids caused by the upregulated
choline phospholipid metabolism. In Aim1, we will validate hypothesis #1 by using modified phospholipid
samples, which will suggest the capability of NOE(-1.6) to measure choline phospholipid metabolism in which
the choline head group is cleaved by phospholipase enzymes and the NOE(-1.6) signal disappears. In Aim2,
we will validate hypothesis #2 by correlating NOE(-1.6) with maps of choline phospholipid contents of whole
slices obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption /ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) on
animal tumor models, which will suggest the capability of NOE(-1.6) to measure altered choline phospholipids
and their metabolism in tumors; We will also develop a novel CEST quantification method, termed adiabatic
Hyperbolic Secant (HS)-CEST, which substitutes HS inversion pulses in place of conventional saturation
pulses, and vary the numbers of HS pulses per unit time to induce different CEST effect in two scans, but vary
the HS pulse amplitude to maintain constant average saturation power so that the background direct saturation
and MT are same. Subtraction of the two scans will isolate CEST effect from background signals, which solves
the challenging issues of non-specificity, B1, and B0 inhomogeneity in conventional CEST imaging. Through
these 3 aims, we will provide a unique MRI method for measuring choline phospholipids and their metabolism
with high sensitivity, which will allow separate hypothesis-driven preclinical and clinical studies of tumors."

Extensive research spanning theory, psychophysics, and physiology has investigated how we rely on statistical
regularities in the environment to improve our sensorimotor behavior: (1) Bayesian theory has provided an
understanding of how one should take advantage of statistical regularities, (2) psychophysical experiments
have documented the impact of such regularities on behavior, and (3) electrophysiology experiments have
identified neural signals that reflect those regularities. An important consideration is that statistical properties of
the environment are rarely stable. Therefore, a most pressing and unresolved question at the frontier of this
interdisciplinary body of work is how malleable brain signals, through experience, gradually acquire information
about new environmental statistics. Here, we will tackle this problem by developing a sensorimotor behavioral
paradigm in the non-human primate model that demands adaptive statistical learning (Aim 1). We will use this
paradigm to test specific computationally-motivated hypotheses regarding how the structure and dynamics of
neural activity in candidate regions of the frontal cortex change throughout learning (Aim 2). Finally, we will use
a dynamical systems approach to analyze the laminar organization of learning signals in the frontal cortex to
tease apart functional sub-circuits with distinct input-output properties that support sensorimotor learning (Aim
3)."

The inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subtype, Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory
disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the precise etiology of IBD is not known, evidence suggests that
environmental factors, including diet, contribute to its pathogenesis.1-3 Specifically, dietary amino acids serve as
key regulatory factors in cellular and microbial metabolic pathways, and disturbances in their metabolism,3 as
well as altered presence of amino acid concentrations (blood/feces/urine), are observed in CD patients.4 Diet
has been shown to have a pro-inflammatory effect in CD, but not much is known about anti-inflammatory diets
(e.g., soy).5, 6 Gut microbial modulation via diet is a needed strategy for the therapeutic management of CD;
however, no specific recommendations exist for CD patients. Moreover, studies show that the person-specific
changes elicited by a dietary intervention on host immune/metabolic function reflect unique microbiota
signatures. This proposal will focus on the microbiota-mediated effects of dietary soy and individual amino
acid supplementation in patients with active CD compared to healthy controls. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that a soy diet induces anti-inflammatory microbiota in CD patients and that the ‘level of response’
for each individual can be predicted by metabolic and microbiome biomarkers. We will test this hypothesis
directly in humans with active CD and mechanistically focus on the effect of dietary soy on the ‘pro-inflammatory
potential’ of gut microbiota in CD patients. Experimentally, we will use our validated human gut microbiota
SAMP1/YitFC; SAMP (hGM-SAMP) mouse model of CD-ileitis to quantify and mechanistically validate the
functional effect of human feces on the severity of CD-ileitis after transplantation into GF SAMP. As a main
objective, we will determine to what extent a soy-based diet could induce changes in fecal/blood inflammatory
biomarkers in patients with active CD. The following aims are a continuation of our efforts to understand the
microbiota-mediated effects of diet on intestinal inflammation. AIM 1: will characterize the effect of dietary soy
in humans with active CD and quantify the inflammatory potential of their gut microbiome using a ‘rapid screening’
hGM-SAMP DSS-colitis model. By stratifying inflammatory microbiome/blood markers, we will identify
biomarkers that could predict ‘responders’/‘non-responders’ to diet. We expect to generate a list of metabolic
and microbiome clinical biomarkers that could be used to monitor response to diet in CD patients. AIM 2: will
determine the impact of soy-associated amino acid dietary supplementation on the microbiome, metabolome
and immunology of a spontaneous CD-like ileitis in hGM-SAMP and SPF SAMP, and AKR control mice. We will
identify functional metabolic mechanisms associated with the severity of mouse CD-ileitis in response to diet.
This proposal is based on strong preliminary data in mouse models of IBD that a soy-based diet treats and
prevents the severity of intestinal inflammation. To translate this information to human CD represents a very
significant area of investigation in this field of research and will ultimately inform the direction of future studies."

Intestinal motility is regulated by the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), which resides entirely within the gut wall
and comprises the largest collection of neurons and glial cells outside of the brain. Previously, we have
provided evidence that post-natal development and adult maintenance of the ENS are controlled by distinct
fetal-juvenile Sox10-expressing and adult Nestin-expressing Enteric Neural Stem Cells (ENSC). With
maturation, the Sox10-expressing cells lose their neurogenic potential in healthy gut but regain it after specific
types of injuries, suggesting that certain juvenile protective factors (JPFs) that allow for Sox10+ cells to
generate neurons in juvenile gut are lost in adults, but are re-introduced upon injury in adults. The continual
genesis of neurons throughout life suggests that a consistent loss of neurons during the juvenile or adult life is
due to significant insufficiencies in the neurogenic capacity of ENSC active at that time. Aging is associated
with significant loss of enteric neurons and associated chronic intestinal dysmotility, suggesting that an
insufficiency in neurogenic capacity of adult ENSC is responsible for such disorders and that the key to crafting
a long-term cure for the elderly patients rests in finding novel strategies to increase or supplement existing
adult neurogenesis to normalize ENS structure and function. If latent neurogenic capacity of adult Sox10+ cells
can be modulated by JPFs, we hypothesize that identifying, recruiting, and re-introducing JPFs into the aging
gut would restart neurogenesis from the newly re-invigorated Sox10+ ENSC and that this strategy holds
promise for providing lasting relief to elderly suffering from chronic intestinal dysmotility by supplementing
insufficient adult Nestin+ derived enteric neurogenesis. Here, we provide significant preliminary data that
identifies some putative extrinsic and intrinsic JPFs and test their effect on ENSC behavior and in this
proposal, we aim to use next-generation sequencing, large-scale single-cell measurements, integrative
cross-platform analyses, and cutting-edge computational tools to identify diverse putative JPFs, describe the
regulatory networks through which they act, and functionally validate their ability to modulate neurogenic
capacity using our novel biological insight to correct ENS structure and function in animal models of aging."

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that has a prevalence of
over 800,000 in the US alone. The economic impact is disproportionally high because it affects primarily young
individuals. The characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent hospitalizations. There
has been a recent shift in clinical practice from a reactive to a proactive CD treatment strategy, recently coined
as “treat-to-target”, where patients are treated to achieve not only an initial response-to-therapy, but also
longer clinical remissions and improved mucosal healing. However, this approach requires the regular
assessment of disease activity using objective markers enabling treatments to be tailored to the individual
patient. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new tools to improve diagnostic accuracy, to quantify disease
burden, and to monitor treatment efficacy. Our application in response to PAR-19-056, “Robust
quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn's disease” is aimed at developing
and evaluating noninvasive, contrast and radiation-free quantitative imaging markers for assessing
disease activity and for monitoring response to therapy. Currently available non-contrast MR imaging
(MRI) sequences such as diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and the calculated apparent diffusion coefficient
(ADC) maps are attractive but limited in providing robust and reproducible markers. Different imaging protocols
or different scanners result in different ADC values. Our primary goal is to develop robust and reliable
quantitative DW-MR imaging markers for the non-contrast and non-invasive assessment of CD. The proposed
novel MRI acquisition and model fitting techniques will provide measurements of slow and fast diffusion as well
as fraction of fast diffusion, as highly accurate, quantitative biomarkers for cell proliferation, density and size,
and tissue perfusion—all indices that characterize the extent of disease activity (i.e., inflammation) in the tissue
micro-structure of the bowel. To achieve this goal, we will first develop and implement an advanced distortion
and motion corrected (DiMoCo) DW-MRI technique and a spatially constrained probabilistic intravoxel
incoherent motion (SPIM) model to compute robust and reproducible markers. Next, we will reduce the
imaging time with estimated x4 acceleration with an accelerated image acquisition and a new, advanced deep
learning-based parameter estimation technique. The proposed imaging techniques and software tools will
provide robust quantitative markers, thereby enabling the accurate assessment of CD activity and response to
therapy. They will also reduce the need for invasive endoscopy procedures as well as the total number of other
tests typically ordered for monitoring disease, effectively reducing both the disease burden and the overall cost
of healthcare. Another important goal is to develop and broadly disseminate open source software that will
enable the standardized evaluation of other diseases presently evaluated with DW-MRI that would benefit from
the advanced diagnostic and assessment capabilities of the proposed DiMoCo SPIM-DW-MRI technique."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the U.S., with the annual total cost of care
estimated at $351 billion. Vascular calcification is a nontraditional CVD risk factor associated with a significant
increase in morbidity and mortality in the general population. Unlike other established risk factors, it is not yet
regarded as a modifiable factor. However, there is emerging evidence that it may drive the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis and play an important role in the regression of atherosclerotic plaques. Our data demonstrated
that overexpression of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) in endothelial cells accelerated
coronary atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic mice, while the TNAP inhibitor SBI-425 reduced manifestations of
coronary artery disease in this model. Subendothelial microcalcification was frequently observed in the internal
elastic lamina in mice and in human arteries and was predicted by computational fluid structure interaction
(FSI) modeling to redistribute wall shear stress on the endothelium. The idea that calcification can promote
atherosclerosis was further supported by an observation of increased low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake by
endothelial cells cultured on surfaces textured with hydroxyapatite particles. More evidence from mouse
models showed that TNAP activity in macrophages was sufficient to increase calcification during progression
of atherosclerosis and interfere with plaque regression, leading to maladaptive dilation of the aortic root.
We hypothesize that calcification is a modifiable factor in atherosclerosis and that inhibiting TNAP-mediated
vascular calcification may have therapeutic value. The overarching goal of this project is to gain a better
understanding of the role of calcification during atherosclerotic lesion initiation, progression, and resolution,
and to determine whether calcification is an active pathogenic factor in atherosclerosis or a mere, likely benign,
secondary response. The project will use computational and in vivo models to delineate hemodynamic
mechanism by which subendothelial microcalcifications increases retention of LDL in the arterial wall. The
effects of the conditional genetic ablation of TNAP in macrophages or an increase of TNAP activity in plasma
will then be tested in a mouse model of familial hypercholesterolemia. Because regression of calcified plaques
can lead to eccentric aortic root remodeling during lipid lowering, we will interrogate whether inhibition of TNAP
with SBI-425 could suppress calcification and alleviate maladaptive remodeling of the aortic root in a mouse
model during reversal of atherosclerosis. In testing TNAP inhibition for its therapeutic utility for atherosclerotic
calcification, we will keep close attention on potential bone side effects by monitoring bone microarchitecture
using micro-computed tomography. The results of this project will establish whether calcification is a
modifiable risk factor in CVD and determine whether systemic TNAP inhibition or elimination of
osteogenic TNAP-expressing macrophages is a viable therapeutic approach in atherosclerosis. The
results of this study will help guide future development of novel therapeutics for this prevalent disease."

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major renal disease that can be caused by ischemia, sepsis, urinary obstruction
and nephrotoxins. It is associated with high mortality clinically and may further lead to chronic kidney diseases
(CKD). Kidney ischemia is one of the leading causes of AKI. It can result from massive heart attack, blood vessel
dysfunction, major cardiac surgery, or other cardiovascular diseases. One of the critical barriers to progress is
how to improve the AKI survival rate, which is closely related to the limited understanding of the regulation of
renal tubular cell death and lack of treatment to prevent renal tubular death. The goal of this application is to
investigate the pathogenic function and regulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with GSTM3P1 as an
example to study the related pathways in renal tubular cell death and to identify new strategies for AKI therapy.
Recent studies identified lncRNAs as critical novel regulators of kidney diseases including AKI. Our focus on
GSTM3P1 is based on (1) we identified GSTM3P1 as a top lncRNA to interact with renal protective microRNAs
(miRNA) (mir-489 and mir-668) in RNA induced silencing complex, suggesting GSTM3P1 as an excellent
example to study the novel regulation mechanism between miRNA and lncRNA; (2) our preliminary studies
indicate potential induction and strong injurious effect of GSTM3P1 during ischemic AKI and the further
understanding of its detailed function and regulation may significantly help AKI therapy development by using
lncRNAs as targets; (3) we also found potential inhibition of GSTM3 by GSTM3P1 and the understanding of the
underlying mechanism will provide new information for lncRNA and pseudogene function. Our central
hypothesis is that GSTM3P1 is induced during kidney ischemia to cause kidney injury by inhibition of renal
protective factors, such as mir-668 and GSTM3. Our objective is to identify new therapeutic targets (GSTM3P1,
GSTM3) for AKI treatment. We will test the hypothesis by three aims. Aim1: Test the hypothesis that GSTM3P1
increases during ischemic AKI to induce renal tubular injury. Aim2: Test the hypothesis that GSTM3P1 interacts
with mir-668 and causes mir-668 decay to induce kidney injury. Aim3: Test the hypothesis that GSTM3P1 can
induce kidney injury through the inhibition of GSTM3. Our expect outcomes include: (1) identifying GSTM3P1
and GSTM3 as new therapeutic targets for AKI; (2) extending the knowledge of lncRNA function in AKI, (3)
extending the knowledge of regulation between lncRNA and miRNA; (4) extending the knowledge of protein
expression regulation by lncRNAs. Our findings will have impact on (1) the AKI research field by elucidating the
pathological role of lncRNA GSTM3P1 and its downstream regulation of mir-668 and GSTM3; and (2) the other
medical research fields for the novel understanding of interaction between miRNA and lncRNA and protein
expression regulation by lncRNA from pseudogene."
10754862,"Inflammatory macrophages play a key role in the development and progression of the atherosclerosis,
leading to myocardial infarction (MI). Sphingolipids are both membrane components and signaling
molecules. Ceramide and Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), bioactive and interchangeable
sphingolipids, regulate a variety of cellular processes, including cell growth and survival, apoptosis, and
immune and cardiovascular functions. As cholesterol, altered sphingolipid metabolism has been
implicated in atherosclerosis. Whereas extensive studies on molecular regulation of cholesterol
biosynthesis led to the discovery of statins, widely used lowering-cholesterol drugs, how sphingolipid
biosynthesis is regulated and its pathophysiological implication are poorly understood.
In this regard, our lab discovered a novel mechanism by which sphingolipid biosynthesis is regulated in
mammals. Nogo-B, a membrane protein of the ER, binds to and inhibits serine palmitoyltransferase
(SPT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis[11]. Mice lacking Nogo-B are
protected from inflammation, hypertension and heart failure, in part via endothelial S1P signaling.
Our long-term goal is to understand how sphingolipid metabolism and signaling is regulated and its
impact on coronary atherosclerosis development and progression.
Recently, we developed a novel mouse model able to develop of coronary lesions, that progress to
disruption (rupture, erosion) or occlusion leading to MI. Our hypothesis that Nogo-B downregulates SL
metabolism and signaling, mainly ceramide and S1P, to control macrophage functions in coronary
inflammation, atherosclerosis development and progression to MI. The rational is that the discovery of
new mechanisms regulating the development and progression of atherosclerosis will provide potential
therapeutic targets for coronary artery disease. Thus, we propose to: 1) investigate the role of MΦ
Nogo-B in the susceptibility of mice to coronary atherosclerosis development and progression to MI; 2)
Decipher the impact of Nogo-B-regulated ceramide and S1P signaling on MΦ biology and mechanistic
insights. This contribution is significant since will identify novel targets for the treatment of coronary
artery disease, especially since available therapies have been only partially successful, and beyond the
statins, there are currently no effective pharmacological strategies that effectively address vascular
inflammation. The proposed research is innovative because we investigate a relevant but understudied
metabolic pathway by using a novel mouse model of coronary atherosclerosis with progression to MI
that better recapitulates the human disease, a heretofore-unexamined process."

Humanity is facing an epidemic of interrelated obesity-associated disorders collectively referred to as metabolic
syndrome (Met Syn). Central features of Met Syn include insulin-resistance, hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis
and hypertension, all of which can progress to highly morbid and costly diseases such as diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and liver failure. Met Syn is associated with systemic chronic low-grade inflammation
(LGI). LGI is not merely a marker of Met Syn but, rather, LGI interferes with a panoply of metabolic signaling
pathways, including insulin and leptin signaling, such that chronic LGI promotes Met Syn. Thus, better
understanding of the underlying causes of LGI is germane to managing the Met Syn epidemic. Proposed
causes of LGI include the notion that obesity itself leads to lipid overload, resulting in endoplasmic reticulum
stress that induces the pro-inflammatory gene expression that defines LGI. However, the grant this application
seeks to renew has shown that LGI, and subsequently Met Syn, can also originate from poor management of
gut microbiota, which is, in fact, required for many aspects of Met Syn. While our hypothesis that alterations in
microbiota promote LGI/Met Syn originated from study of mice with a genetically engineered innate immune
deficiency, namely lack of the flagellin receptor toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) it has since proven applicable to
understanding how diet, particularly industrialization of the food supply, might be altering the microbiota-host
relationship in a manner that promotes LGI and, subsequently, Met Syn. Indeed, we’ve found that a central
feature of Met Syn in both mice and humans, is infiltration of bacteria into the normally near-sterile inner mucus
layer. Such microbiota encroachment can activate pro-inflammatory signaling in the intestine and/or result in
translocation of bacteria, and their products, into liver and adipose tissue thus driving LGI in these organs. In
contrast, obese humans lacking microbiota encroachment also lacked Met Syn . Moreover, in mice, ablation of
microbiota via antibiotics, germfree status, or maintaining gnotobiotic mice with the pathobiont-free
microbiome, results in a seemingly analogous state of “healthy obesity” in response to a western-style diet
(WSD). Together, these results underscore our central hypothesis that microbiota encroachment is a pivotal
event in driving LGI and, subsequently Met Syn. This hypothesis holds that preventing or reversing microbiota
encroachment will ameliorate Met Syn. Hence, we will propose to identify encroaching bacteria (Aim 1) and
define how they drive LGI and impact metabolism (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will develop means to train the
immune system to reduce microbiota encroachment and ameliorate Met Syn (Aim 3)."

Emphysema is a common pathologic manifestation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the
fourth leading cause of death in the United States. The most important modifiable risk factor for emphysema is
chronic exposure to cigarette smoke (CS). Yet, not all smokers develop emphysema and, therefore, cellular
responses to CS are important mechanisms underlying disease progression. Our long-term goal is to define
the cellular responses to CS and oxidative stress that protect the lung from emphysema. We have identified a
cytoprotective role for the innate immune cytokine Macrophage Migration Inhibitory (MIF). MIF decreases
oxidative stress and consequences of oxidative stress (e.g. cellular senescence and apoptosis) in lung
endothelial cells, and mice with a genetic deletion of Mif are susceptible to emphysema. MIF is secreted in
response to CS, but, paradoxically, MIF is decreased in patients with severe COPD. Targeting MIF, or its
downstream pathways, may be therapeutic. However, MIF is a pleiotropic molecule with broad regulatory effects.
To translate MIF biology into therapy, it will be essential to dissect out its cytoprotective pathways. Our goal for
this proposal is to determine the mechanisms through which MIF antagonizes the development of emphysema.
Our preliminary data suggests MIF mediates its protective effects through its receptor CD74. Our hypothesis is
MIF protects against the development of emphysema by mitigating CS-mediated endothelial senescence in a
CD74 dependent manner. In Aim 1, we will define the mechanism through which the MIF-CD74 interaction
reduces endothelial senescence. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of endothelial CD74 in regulating
susceptibility to emphysema. In Aim 3, we will determine the therapeutic potential of targeting MIF-CD74
interactions in emphysema. Completion of these aims will significantly advance our understanding of the
pathogenesis of emphysema and may identify precision-based approaches based on MIF biology for treating
patients with emphysema."

 In this project, we propose to develop and optimize a novel X-ray fluorescence emission tomography system
and reconstruction algorithm to image trace gold in biological samples. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) play an
important role in cancer therapy, serving as radiosensitizers in metal-meditated radiation therapy and as critical
components to photothermal ablation therapy. These therapies offer a promising treatment for superficial lesions
and are currently being explored in in vivo and clinical trials, but could see improved efficacy and decreased side
effects if the location and concentrations of GNPs could be mapped accurately. However current metal-mapping
methods do not provide the sensitivity or tissue penetration depth necessary to image relevant metal
concentrations. For these therapies to be translated to the clinic, there needs to be a highly sensitive metal-
mapping imaging modality that can image gold at the relevant concentrations and depths.
 In recent years, X-ray fluorescence tomography has emerged as a promising modality for metal-mapping.
Specifically, X-ray fluorescence emission tomography (XFET) offers high sensitivity needed for imaging trace
gold used in in vivo and clinical studies. Furthermore, XFET offers advantages over other x-ray fluorescence
imaging modalities: it provides a direct measurement of the metal without noise-amplifying tomographic image
reconstruction, and it does not require a full sinogram, which limits the tissue penetration depth of other
modalities. In the proposed work, we will optimize the hardware acquisition parameters of an existing XFET
system to maximize gold detectability. We will also optimize an XFET image reconstruction algorithm to jointly
estimate metal maps as well as attenuation maps, providing a novel method for obtaining an attenuation map
that would otherwise be obtained by an additional, dose-delivering computed tomography (CT) scan.
 The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) develop algorithms and a realistic forward model to jointly
reconstruct metal distributions and attenuation maps of objects, 2) optimize XFET hardware acquisition
parameters to maximize gold detectability at specified radiation dose levels, and 3) validate reconstruction
methods and optimization strategies in mouse phantom models, assess minimum detectable gold concentration,
and compare image quality metrics to CT. Upon completion, aim 1 will provide a method to map metals at low
concentrations, and a novel method of obtaining an attenuation map using fluorescent emission data. Aim 2 will
design a novel system geometry with parameters that maximize gold detectability. Aim 3 will demonstrate XFET
sensitivity limits and compare image quality metrics to an existing system. These results will allow us to make
predictions about this preclinical system’s capabilities in an eventual clinical scenario, paving the way for XFET
to be used as a clinical imaging system capable of mapping therapeutic GNPs for safer treatment and fewer side
effects in cancer therapies."
10733447,"Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders
following spinal cord injury (SCI). The burden of depression post-SCI is significant, as it is associated with higher
cost, lower quality of life, and shorter survival time. Treating depression can be complicated, but it is vital.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a type of non-invasive brain stimulation, is an FDA-approved
treatment option for depression that is utilized throughout the Veterans Affairs (VA) health system. However, no
published studies have examined the effectiveness of rTMS for depression post-SCI. The updated Clinical
Practice Guidelines for Spinal Cord Medicine for the Management of Mental Health Disorders (2020) by the
Paralyzed Veterans of America recommends explicitly that future research examines rTMS in the SCI population.
The critical challenge of administering rTMS for depression post-SCI is dosing. Currently, the resting motor
threshold, a motor response of the right abductor pollicis brevis, is used to dose rTMS. Over half of the SCI
population has incomplete or complete tetraplegia, indicating some degree of upper extremity [(UE)] impairment.
Thus, if using current rTMS dosing parameters, it is plausible to conclude that over half the SCI population could
be excluded from receiving rTMS for depression or may receive an improper dose, impacting the intervention's
safety and effectiveness. [This study specifically addresses current limitations in treating depression post-
SCI using rTMS and will: (1) identify the target electric-field (e-field) for rTMS; (2) evaluate a novel
method, reverse-calculation e-field modeling, to determine the rTMS dose to treat depression in
individuals with SCI; (3) conduct a pilot clinical trial using reverse-calculation e-field modeling to dose
rTMS for depression post-SCI; (4) provide the appropriate training environment for the applicant to
develop into an independent VA researcher; and (5) generate the necessary pilot data to support a future
VA Merit Award application.] E-field modeling is a computational model that accounts for the TMS coil type,
circuitry and placement, individual anatomy obtained through T1 and T2- weighted magnetic resonance images,
and conductivity variance between tissue types. [First, using existing trial data, e-field modeling will be used to
determine the target e-field dose for treating depression with rTMS.] Next, twenty-four individuals with SCI and
depression will be randomized to receive either 6-weeks of rTMS treatment dosed using reverse-calculation e-
field modeling (n=18) or sham treatment (n=6). We will examine the between-group effects of treatment on
depressive symptoms using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The dose identified by reverse-calculation
e-field modeling will be used in combination with FDA-approved parameters: 3,000 pulses/session at 10 Hz, 5
days/week for 6 weeks. Study outcomes will include changes in depressive symptoms, quality of life [(QOL)],
and participation. During the award period, the applicant will capitalize on resources available through the Ralph
H. Johnson VA Medical Center and its affiliated academic institution, Medical University of South Carolina. One
primary example is the National Center for Neuromodulation for Rehabilitation (NIH P2 CHD086844). By utilizing
these resources and hands-on training from renowned local experts, the applicant aims to develop the requisite
skills and understanding of data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of neurobiological variables, imaging,
and e-field modeling. The overall goal of this CDA-2 application is to expose the candidate to a rich local
environment for SCI recovery research, providing the foundation for developing into an independent VA
researcher studying the effects of and viable treatment options for depression post-SCI to improve the
lives and rehabilitation outcomes of Veterans. The proposed training plan will enhance the candidate's
understanding of neuromodulation, neuropsychiatric disorders, and the design and delivery of neurorehabilitation
trials. The data generated will inform the development of additional interventions focused on neuromodulation to
improve function and QOL for individuals following SCI and other patient populations with UE motor impairment."
10762468,"A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment
 Unhealthy diet is strongly linked to risks of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases,
diabetes and certain types of cancer. The Global Burden of Disease Study has found that, among
the top 17 risk factors, poor diet is overwhelmingly the No. 1 risk factor for human diseases.
Despite the strong connection between diet and health, unhealthy foods with large portion sizes
are widely consumed. Currently, 68.5% of U.S. adults are overweight, among the highest in
developed countries. The recent decline in U.S. life expectancy sent another alarming signal
about the general health of the American people. Understanding how the diet-related risk factors
affect people’s health and finding effective ways to empower them in improving lifestyle habits are
among the most important tasks in public health. Unfortunately, dietary assessment in real-world
settings has been exceedingly complex and inaccurate to implement. Technology is needed that
allows researchers to assess dietary intake easily and accurately in real world settings so that
effective intervention to manage obesity and related chronic diseases can be developed. We
propose a biomedical engineering project to address the dietary assessment problem,
taking advantage of advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial
intelligence.
 Our research team has been improving the ability to assess diet for over a decade. We have
designed the eButton, a small wearable device pinned on clothes in front of the chest, capable of
collecting image-based dietary data objectively and passively (i.e., without depending on subject’s
self-report or volitional operation of the device). We have also developed algorithms to compute
food volumes and nutrients from images. Since the eButton was developed, it has been used by
many researchers in the U.S. and other countries for objective and passive diet-intake studies in
both adults and children.
 Despite the past successes, there have been two lingering critical problems associated with
the objective and passive dietary assessment using wearable devices: 1) substantial manual
efforts are required for researchers to visually examine image data to identify foods and estimate
their volumes (portion sizes), and 2) there are privacy concerns about researchers’ viewing of
participants’ real-life images. Although solving these problems could enable the eButton and other
wearable devices for large-scale diet-intake studies, we were not able to find effective solutions
until recently when Artificial intelligence (AI) emerged. Advanced AI systems, especially those
based on deep learning, can be trained by large amounts of labeled data to produce results
comparable or even superior to those produced by human in numerous fields of applications. AI
technology is also a powerful tool for dietary assessment, potentially providing an ideal solution
to the two previously mentioned problems. We thus propose to develop a human-mimetic AI
system to recognize foods from images, estimate portion sizes, and find energy and nutrient
values from a database in a fully automatic process. Using the AI approach, there will be no need
for researchers to view participants’ real-life images, and the AI system well-respects individuals’
privacy because it is trained to recognizes human foods only, nothing else.
 Currently, the performances of existing AI systems are limited by the extensive variety and
high variability of human foods, insufficient training data, and difficulty in finding appropriate
nutritional information from food databases. In this application, we propose a new strategy to
personalize the AI system for each research participant using an advanced mathematical model
of personal food choices. With this personalization step, the dimensionality of our envisioned AI
system can be reduced drastically, and our goal of automatic, objective and passive dietary
assessment can be reached realistically. We also propose to improve the electronic hardware
and develop a biomimetic camera to enlarge the field of view for the eButton. Finally, we will
conduct a thorough evaluation of the personalized AI system in real-world settings using human
subjects."
10753447,"SUMMARY
Pulmonary fibrosis is the result of a poorly understood, dysregulated cellular response that is difficult to diagnose
and treat. A common form, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), has a progressive, downhill course. There are no
well-established molecular biomarkers for diagnosis, treatment, or disease activity. Clinicians currently depend
on changes in chest computed tomography (CT) and pulmonary function to monitor patients. Moreover, there
are only two approved drug therapies, and treatment is not guided by molecular biomarkers. Lung CCR2+ (C-C
motif chemokine receptor 2) inflammatory monocytes and their pathologic progeny, interstitial macrophages, are
strongly associated with the experimental development of lung fibrosis, elevated in the lungs of patients with
pulmonary fibrosis, and produce profibrotic factors. Fibrosis is significantly attenuated in Ccr2 null mice and by
deletion of CCR2+ progeny macrophages, strongly supporting a role for CCR2+ cells in human disease. This
proposal aims to utilize a molecular, positron-emission tomography (PET)-based diagnostic to detect CCR2-
mediated inflammation in the lungs of patients with fibrosis and to develop targeted therapies. Our
multidisciplinary group has established that a peptide-based radiotracer, 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i, identifies CCR2+
monocytes in animal models and has acceptable dosimetry in our recent human Phase 0/1 trial of PET/CT
imaging. The known relationship of CCR2+ cells to pulmonary fibrosis and the clinical challenges of managing
patients with IPF, make this disease particularly suited for evaluating the radiotracer. Therefore, we have used
multiple mouse models of lung fibrosis to show that increased 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i lung uptake correlates with
CCR2+ cell infiltration and fibrosis. Our data also show that the radiotracer detects decreases in lung uptake in
bleomycin-induced fibrosis after blockade of interleukin-1b, a mediator of fibrosis expressed in CCR2+ cells, and
treatment with anti-fibrotic drug, pirfenidone. Pilot CCR2-PET imaging of patients with IPF show increased lung
signal, particularly in regions of subpleural fibrosis. We propose to use 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i PET imaging to
evaluate modulation of CCR2+-specific inflammation during the course of fibrotic lung disease in animal models,
validate the detection of CCR2 cells in human lung tissue, and assess the potential for monitoring patients. We
hypothesize that 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i detects the CCR2+ cell inflammatory process associated with pulmonary
fibrosis and can be used to monitor disease activity. Specific aims are: (1) In mouse fibrosis models, assess the
change in the 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i PET/CT uptake relative to inflammation and fibrosis upon treatment with clinical
anti-fibrotic drugs and following molecular targeting with CCR2 antagonists, and (2) In patients with IPF, assess
the relationship between PET uptake, CT imaging, and clinical status, then validate the relationship of PET
uptake with CCR2-mediated inflammation and pro-fibrotic gene expression in lungs removed after transplant.
Together, the aims provide a platform to obtain detailed information related to the underpinnings of CCR2+ cell
imaging in IPF and the interpretation of human studies that may lead to targeted molecular therapies for IPF."
10767171,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Asian Americans have more sleep deficiencies compared to Whites or Hispanics. However, most studies of
sleep disparities have focused on African Americans and Hispanics, and research on Asians remains scarce.
Our preliminary study among Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americans found that acculturative stress was
inversely associated with sleep duration and positively associated with sleep disturbance and risk of sleep apnea.
Importantly, COVID-19 has adversely affected health, including sleep, with minority populations being
disproportionately affected. Additionally, increasing hate speech and racist attacks against Asians have been
reported, leading to increased mental and emotional toll in this population. Findings from the preliminary study
also demonstrated that sleep duration was inversely associated with diabetes, and sleep apnea was positively
associated with hypertension and obesity.
 The overarching goal of this innovative longitudinal study is to understand: (1) mechanisms of sleep disparities
in relation to immigrant stressors and protective factors; and (2) consequences of sleep disparities on health
outcomes, in a sample of community-dwelling Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese adults (n=750). This study
includes several innovations such as novel measures on anti-Asian racism due to COVID-19, the adverse impact
of COVID-19, and multi-dimensional sleep health; use of dried blood spots; purposive sampling of 3 Asian
subgroups; and considering ethnic enclaves as a protective factor.
 Over the 5-year project period, the investigators will collect and analyze two waves of data in order to: (1)
Determine the longitudinal association between immigrant stressors (e.g., acculturative stress, psychological stress
and adverse impact of COVID-19, anti-Asian racism, and neighborhood disadvantage) and sleep health (a multi-
dimensional assessment of sleep health and disturbance); (2) Evaluate the moderating effect of potential
protective factors (e.g., social support, religious involvement, ethnic enclaves, and neighborhood social cohesion)
on the associations between immigrant stressors and sleep health; (3) Examine the longitudinal association
between sleep health and markers of cardiometabolic risk; and (4) Test whether specific dimensions of sleep
health will mediate the association between immigrant stressors and health outcomes.
 This will be one of the first longitudinal studies to investigate mechanisms of sleep disparities in relation to
immigrant stressors and the consequences of sleep disparities on health outcomes among Asians, an
understudied minority population which displays poorer sleep outcomes relative to other groups. This study is
timely considering the rapid growth of Asians in the U.S., and the current hostile environment for Asians and
immigrants, including COVID-19. This innovative study will elucidate health issues of this understudied group and
identify modifiable factors that will serve as targets for intervention to reduce sleep disparities among Asians."
10756499,"Oral cancer causes more prevalent and severe pain than any other cancer. Oral cancer patients suffer from
severe, chronic, mechanically-induced pain; talking and eating are profoundly disrupted. Opioids are plagued
with side effects and ineffective as tolerance develops; there is no satisfactory treatment for oral cancer pain.
Our long-term goal is to develop cancer-targeting non-viral gene therapy to disrupt nociceptive signaling in the
cancer microenvironment with minimal off-target effects and translate our approach to patients. We created
two non-viral vectors with excellent transfection efficiency and no cytotoxicity: a cell-permeable peptide com-
bined with a cationic lipid for DNA; and, a lipopolymer for RNA. Non-viral transfection with OPRM1 (μ-opioid
receptor gene, MOR) DNA led to re-expression of MOR and partial attenuation of nociception (i.e., pain) in
cancer mouse models. Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) is elevated in the primary afferent neurons that
innervate the cancer and drive pain. Knockdown of F2rl1 (PAR2 gene) partially attenuated nociception. While
both approaches partially reduce cancer pain, our goal is elimination. Complete analgesia poses a challenge;
there are multiple and redundant pain pathways, and genomic heterogeneity in oral cancer produces variations
in the pathways. As a strategy to obstruct these multiple and varied pathways, we posit that a combination of
OPRM1 re-expression and F2RL1 downregulation in the cancer could eliminate pain. The central hypothesis is
that a non-viral vector approach to gain OPRM1 re-expression and F2RL1 downregulation within the oral can-
cer will eliminate cancer pain and fully restore function. The rationale for this project is that demonstration of
therapeutic efficacy of co-delivery of OPRM1 DNA and F2RL1 RNAi or CRISPR/Cas9 will yield a scientifically
rigorous framework for development of non-opioid therapies that can be translated to patients. The central hy-
pothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) Determine the feasibility and efficacy of ex vivo transfection (i.e.,
transfection of oral cancer cells with dual genes prior to generation of a xenograft mouse model); and, in vivo
transfection (i.e., direct inoculation of genes into the oral cancer in the chemical carcinogen mouse model) with
OPRM1 DNA and/or F2RL1 RNAi or CRISPR/Cas9 with the non-viral vectors to eliminate cancer-induced pain
in mouse models; 2) Measure pain in oral cancer patients, analyze OPRM1 and F2RL1 expression in their can-
cers relative to matched normal tissue, and analyze the correlation between dysregulation of these genes and
patients’ pain. The results will give us data regarding the proportion of oral cancer patients who might benefit
from co-delivery of DNA and RNA and set the stage for a clinical trial. The research proposed in this applica-
tion is innovative because co-delivery of DNA and RNA into a cancer with non-viral vectors for the manage-
ment of pain has not been done. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to prove strong
scientific justification for the continued development and future clinical trials of novel dual gene therapy. Ulti-
mately, such knowledge might lead to development of novel non-opioid therapies for cancer pain."
10753484,"Project Summary
DNA damage blocks the progress of the replisome. Left unresolved these lesions can result in cell death. A
prominent resolution mechanism is translesion synthesis (TLS), a DNA damage tolerance pathway in which an
error-prone TLS polymerase switches with a high fidelity replicative polymerase to synthesize past the lesion,
enabling the replisome to progress past the damage. While TLS polymerases contribute to genome stability,
their misregulation has been implicated in both cancer progression and the development of antimicrobial
resistance. This proposal will employ biochemical and genetic approaches in combination with in vitro and cell
based single-molecule imaging to understand how TLS is regulated during bacterial replication.
Aim 1: Elucidate the role of SSB in regulating Pol IV-mediated TLS
We have demonstrated that the TLS polymerase Pol IV is recruited to replisomes in a DNA damage dependent
manner through interactions with SSB. As SSB is constitutively present in the replisome this raises the
question of how Pol IV is selectively targeted to stalled forks. In this aim we will work to elucidate this
mechanism by determining the dynamics of SSB and the molecular events that lead to Pol IV recruitment.
Finally, by using single-molecule imaging of other SSB-interacting proteins (SIPs), we will test if damage-
dependent replisome recruitment is a general mechanism or if it is unique to Pol IV.
Aim 2: Is an interaction with SSB important for recruiting TLS polymerases to their site of action?
Building on our observations that the interaction of Pol IV with SSB is critical for its ability to carry out TLS, we
will determine if an interaction between Pol II and SSB is also important for its function. In this aim we will
develop mutants that selectively ablate the Pol II-SSB interaction. With these mutants in hand we will next ask
whether the Pol II-SSB interaction is required for the recruitment of Pol II to stalled replisomes and TLS.
Furthermore, we will determine the role of the Pol IV-SSB interaction in mutagenic DNA double strand break
repair, a pathway implicated in adaptive mutagenesis and antibiotic resistance.
Aim 3: How do conformational dynamics of Pol III regulate TLS polymerase access and synthesis?
In order to determine how Pol IV binds and dissociates from the b2 clamp, we will use single-molecule FRET to
follow the conformational dynamics of the polymerase-clamp complex during active replication. Furthermore,
we will determine how DNA lesions on the template strand influence these conformational dynamics.
Aim 4: Identify factors that influence the competition between TLS at the fork and repriming
Repriming of DNA synthesis downstream of a lesion competes with TLS to resolve stalled replication forks. We
present preliminary cellular and in vitro data that accessory helicases accelerate repriming kinetics. In this aim
we will work to identify the helicases that can exert this effect and their mechanism of action."
10744191,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the United States, approximately half of women 75 and older undergo screening mammography. Despite
widespread use, the benefits of mammography in this age group remain uncertain, as no randomized trials of
mammography have included women over the age of 74. Because breast cancer is an age-related disease,
screening may have an important role in reducing breast cancer morbidity and mortality for older women. On
the other hand, harms of screening, including overdiagnosis, may also be prevalent among older women. The
overarching goal of the proposed research is to help older women who are considering breast cancer
screening make more informed decisions. To do this, we will first generate improved estimates of the benefits
and harms of screening that reflect the heterogeneity of life expectancy among older women. Using Medicare
claims linked to cancer incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program,
we will apply state-of-the-art techniques to generate estimates of the mortality benefit of mammography across
a range of life expectancies. We will also use SEER data to quantify risk of breast cancer overdiagnosis among
women 75 and older, according to life expectancy. Lastly, in collaboration with patients, we will develop and
test a decision aid that presents personalized estimates of benefits and harms from breast cancer screening.
Our goal is to both generate better data to support decisions and also develop a decision aid as a tool that will
allow women to access that data and ultimately make more informed decisions about breast cancer screening.
The candidate, Ilana Richman, MD, is a general internist at the Yale School of Medicine. Dr. Richman is
committed to improving our understanding of the effectiveness and value of cancer screening. This proposal
will capitalize on Dr. Richman’s foundational training in biostatistics and epidemiology, while providing an
opportunity to gain additional skill in gerontologic biostatistics, qualitative methods, and decision aid design and
testing. To achieve these goals, Dr. Richman has assembled an experienced multidisciplinary mentorship
team. Her primary mentor, Dr. Cary Gross, is a nationally renowned physician investigator with extensive
expertise in evaluating cancer outcomes, particularly among older adults. Dr. Gross also brings a track record
of exceptional success as a mentor to junior faculty and trainees. Dr. Richman will benefit from the rich
environment at Yale, which is home world-class investigators studying cancer screening and prevention, and
the health of aging populations. At the conclusion of this award, Dr. Richman will be well positioned to become
an independent investigator and a leader committed to improving patient-centered decision-making about
cancer screeing."
10778568,"Acute pancreatitis (AP) affects ≈ 275,000/ year in the USA, and is the commonest gastroenterological cause of
hospitalization. The major morbidity and cost from AP is from the severe disease which occurs in 10-25%
patients. Over the last several years, the proportion of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) has increased from being
<5%, to sometimes >20% of all AP causes. Moreover HTG is now commonly noted to co-exist with AP, and
this, along with HTG AP often result in sustained organ failure, and consequently severe AP. Our previous
work shows that the fat stored as triglycerides (TG) in visceral adipocytes, provides a fuel for the lipases
leaked from the pancreas during AP. This stored triglyceride can be hydrolyzed by the lipases into fatty acids,
which then result in multi-system organ failure and severe AP. We have also learnt that this triglyceride when
unsaturated causes worse AP outcomes than saturated visceral fat. In Aim 1A, we will determine if TG
composition is associated with the severity of the clinical HTG AP episode. For this the clinical course of
patients admitted to Mayo Clinic AZ with a diagnosis of AP will be studied in the context of their TG amounts,
TG composition at admission, and lipolytically generated total, and unbound fatty acids. In Aim 1B noting that
the composition of dietary fat intake affects the composition of circulating TGs, we propose to study how
dietary TG composition affects circulating TG behavior during HTG AP, by comparing the severity of HTG AP
in the context of its composition. In Aim 1C we will study whether genetic deletion of PNLIP will reduce the
severity of HTG AP. We will also focus on the use of heparin as an agent that releases LPL, such as when
used as anticoagulant for plasma exchange during the management of HTG AP. The clinical literature shows
worse outcomes when heparin is used in these scenarios, and our preliminary data show that heparin
accelerates fatty acid generation and worsens the outcomes of HTG when this TG is unsaturated. Aim 2
focusses on the mechanisms on why ω6 and ω9 unsaturated triglyceride is a more risky form of triglyceride
during pancreatitis. In aim 1A, based on preliminary findings that ω3 and saturated fatty acids interfere with the
hydrolysis of a triglyceride containing them, we propose to study the molecular basis and energetics of how a
TGs composition affects its lipolysis by pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PNLIP) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In
Aim 2B based on previous work showing that unsaturated fatty acids cause more injury than saturated fatty
acids, we propose to study how the double bonds in an unsaturated fatty acid affect its behavior in an aqueous
environment like ours. Lastly in Aim 2C we will determine the role of ω3 fatty acids in affecting a TG’s lipolysis
vs. how the ω3 bond affects the behavior of a NEFA in cellular signaling. The results of Aim 2 will explain the
role of triglyceride composition in determining the severity of HTG AP. Overall these studies will provide novel
mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and outcomes of HTG and HTG AP, along with clinically relevant,
scientifically sound approaches to improve these outcomes."
10543805,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Staphylococcus epidermidis is a ubiquitous member of the human skin and mucosal microbiota. Functionally, it
is a key contributor to human health via immune modulation and microbial community homeostasis. Yet the
‘commensal’ S. epidermidis is also an important pathogen and disease risk reservoir—it is the most frequent
cause of medical device and bloodstream infections. Multiple phylogenetically diverse subspecies, or strains,
of S. epidermidis can co-inhabit the skin with genomes of variable gene content. The overwhelming majority of
these genes have unknown function. We hypothesize that this variable gene content, or accessory genome,
interacts with core genes to enable strains to uniquely respond to and thrive in different environments, and that
mixing of these genetically diverse strains is necessary to maintain a healthy homeostasis in the skin. To
investigate the function of these genes and to understand how genetic diversity at the strain level contributes to
population-level phenotype, we will functionally profile a set of phylogenetically diverse strains isolated from
healthy individuals and individuals with bloodstream infections. We will create CRISPRi tools for gene
knockdown in S. epidermidis to systematically identify strain-specific and core genes that underlie the ability to
colonize and compete in the skin and infections. Aim 1 develops the CRISPRi genetic toolkit to created pooled
S. epidermidis knockdown pools. Phenotypic profiling these pools will greatly expand our knowledge of
important commensal strategies employed by a common microbial partner, and how genetic heterogeneity
may impact the commensal to infectious transition. Aim 2 investigates the role of strain admixture in this
transition. This combination of genomic approaches and mechanistic studies will provide the first investigation
into the function of the S. epidermidis pangenome. Annotating inter-strain genetic diversity will reveal new
insights into the functional consequence of strain diversity: how strains can successfully transition between
commensal and virulence lifestyles, and how multiple strains can co-exist in an ecological network."

The goals of the Model Organisms Core are to carry out the biohazardous research projects that are proposed
in the Projects 1-4 and within the Core itself, and to maintain the culture collection of different strains of both
species of Coccidioides. This Core has two aims. One is to carry out all the activities and experiments proposed
in the projects that involve live, virulent Coccidioides species, Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii,
as they are classified as BSL3 pathogens. The other aim of the Core C is to utilize new methods to make targeted
mutations in conserved genes in both species of Coccidioides, and to test the mutants for their ability to grow on
media and in mice. The BSL3 facility will enable testing new hypotheses from Projects 1, 2, & 3 in mice, and to
generate new hypotheses about immune responses from the results of mouse experiments proposed in Aim 1
to inform Project 3. The proposed studies in Aim 2 are directly related to Project 4 and will also shed light on the
fungal genes that contribute to virulence, which may be new targets for therapeutics, and to identify host genes
and response pathways that control immune responses to Coccidioides infection, which may reveal new
therapeutic targets for biological agents."
10755643,"Psychomotor-stimulant Use Disorder (PUD) is a chronic relapsing disorder, characterized by a high propensity
for relapse even during protracted abstinence. In both humans with PUD & animal models, the intensity of cue-
elicited drug craving & drug-seeking behavior increases or “incubates” during protracted withdrawal. The
neurochemical underpinnings of drug craving & its incubation are not well understood. Drug cue-induced
increase in metabolic hyperactivity within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is correlated with the intensity of drug-
craving in humans. Consistent with this, we have reported a link between the magnitude of drug-seeking in a rat
model of cocaine-taking & a number of abnormalities in glutamate (GLU) transmission within the ventromedial
aspect of the PFC (vmPFC). Notably, incubated cocaine-seeking is associated with a time-dependent increase
in the capacity of drug-predictive cues to increase GLU levels, primarily within the prelimbic (PL) subregion. We
theorize this cue-elicited rise in GLU might underpin cue-elicited increases in metabolic hyperactivity observed
within PFC of PUD patients. Importantly: (1) the increased GLU responsiveness to drug-predictive cues is
selective for rats with a cocaine-taking history; (2) the magnitude of the GLU increase predicts the vigor of
cocaine-seeking behavior; & (3) neuropharmacological inhibition of GLU transmission within the PL eliminates
cocaine-incubated responding. Intriguingly, the incubated cue-responsiveness of vmPFC GLU is inversely
related to cue-elicited changes in vmPFC dopamine (DA). This inverse neurochemical relation has led to the
over-arching hypothesis to be tested in this proposal:
the incubation of cue-elicited drug-seeking behavior
results from dysregulated GLU-DA interactions w ithin the PL subregion of the vmPFC
. Aim 1 of this
proposal employs neuropharmacological approaches to systematically target & dissect the relative contribution
of postsynaptic AMPA & NMDA GLU receptor subtypes to the manifestation of incubated cocaine-seeking &
examine for the generalization of pharmacological effects to a highly prevalent psychomotor-stimulant,
methamphetamine (MA), as well as the non-drug reinforcer, sucrose. It is hypothesized in Aim 1 that the
incubation of COC craving is driven by GLU-mediated activation of ionotropic GLU receptors within
vmPFC. Aim 2 will employ a combination of in vivo microdialysis & neuropharmacological approaches to
examine the role for D1- & D3-type DA receptors & their regulation of GLU, DA & GABA release within the
vmPFC in incubated cocaine-, MA- & sucrose-seeking. It is hypothesized in Aim 2 that
the incubation of cue-
elicited GLU release, cellular hyperactivity & drug-seeking reflect time-dependent anomalies in DA
signaling within PL.
 The proposal presents a series of theoretically innovative experiments designed to address
the biobehavioral underpinnings of incubated craving, which will advance our basic understanding of the
neurobiology of relapse."
10749915,"Durable outcomes in subsets of solid cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) or adoptive
cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy has driven interest in gaining a better understanding of resistance
mechanisms that could identify novel druggable targets. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) have
emerged as one such barrier based on their ability to inhibit innate and adaptive immunity. While elevated blood
MDSC are recognized as a poor prognostic indicator in cancer patients, it is widely thought that the main effector
site for MDSC is within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This is in line with the well-documented contact-
dependent mechanisms involving short-lived intermediates that underlie known mechanisms of T cell
suppression by MDSC. Our published and preliminary studies enlarge on this view, showing that MDSC also
function outside the TME through an unprecedented mechanism of intravascular immune suppression. The
proposed study builds on our discovery that circulating MDSC initiate contact-dependent cleavage of the L-
selectin homing receptor on target T cells that substantially reduces antigen-driven expansion of cytotoxic T cells
in lymph nodes. We further found that L-selectin loss coincides with the formation of stable MDSC clusters in the
blood of murine tumor models and advanced cancer patients. We term these new structures circulating myeloid
cell (CMC) clusters. These observations led us to hypothesize that CMC clusters are an unrecognized functional
niche for systemic immune suppression in cancer. To test this hypothesis, we will first determine if blood-borne
MDSC target not only naïve T cells, but more broadly attack stem cell memory and central memory T cells and
natural killer cells that each require L-selectin for their antitumor activity. Secondly, we will determine if CMC
clusters are the active site of L-selectin cleavage by using a multipronged genetic approach to examine L-selectin
fate following disruption of MDSC-T cell conjugate formation in vivo. These mechanistic studies center on β2
integrins that are highly expressed by MDSC but are normally inactive on leukocytes in fast-flowing blood under
non-pathological conditions. Thirdly, we will examine the translational relevance of CMC clusters during ICI or
ACT therapy in a preclinical model in which blood is the primary effector site for MDSC due to their exclusion
from the TME (by blocking chemokine-directed trafficking) and spleen (by splenectomy). We will deplete
circulating MDSC in this model using antibodies or a clinically relevant liver-X-receptor agonist that induces
MDSC-intrinsic apoptosis to establish if blood-borne MDSC contribute to therapeutic resistance. Complementary
studies will test the hypothesis that combining the analysis of circulating MDSC with CMC clusters and/or T cell
L-selectin will formulate an immunosuppressive signature that predicts response to first-line therapy in metastatic
cancer patients. The proposed studies will provide new insights into an unprecedented function of circulating
myeloid cells and could lead to the consideration of CMC clusters as a functional biomarker for prognostication
or preselection of patients that would benefit from MDSC-depleting regimens during cancer immunotherapy."
10749008,"Summary/Abstract
 Pertussis (aka whooping cough) is re-emerging in developed countries despite high vaccine coverage.
Resurgence is due primarily to waning immunity to the causal bacterium Bordetella pertussis (Bp) in adolescents
and young adults immunized with acellular (aP) pertussis vaccines. Moreover, while aP vaccination protects
against disease, at least initially, it does not protect against colonization or prevent transmission, which puts
infants, who are most vulnerable to serious and sometimes fatal disease, at greater risk. New vaccines that
protect against both colonization and disease are needed. Their development requires a better understanding of
the molecular mechanisms underlying Bp virulence.
 A strictly human-adapted pathogen, Bp is extremely closely related to Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb),
which infects nearly all mammals. Bp and Bb produce a nearly identical set of virulence factors, some of which,
including filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT), are functionally
interchangeable. FHA is a critical adhesin, a component of acellular vaccines, and the prototypical member of
the Two Partner Secretion (TPS) family. Using Bb and its natural hosts (rats and mice), we showed that in
addition to mediating adherence to host cells, FHA plays important roles in controlling the initial inflammatory
response to infection and in mediating defense of the bacteria against clearance by phagocytic cells, which
contributes to persistence in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). Our work on the mechanism of secretion and
processing of the “precursor” FhaB protein to FHA has led to major advances in the mechanism of two partner
secretion, and we showed that FhaB itself, rather than FHA, is critical for bacterial persistence in the LRT. ACT
also contributes to bacterial persistence in the LRT by mediating defense against phagocytic cell clearance.
We and others have shown that ACT binds to FhaB/FHA on the bacterial surface. We propose a model in
which ACT, while bound to FhaB on the bacterial surface, binds to CR3 on phagocytic cells, triggering
degradation of the C-terminal, periplasmically-located, FhaB prodomain, resulting in efficient delivery of ACT to
phagocytic cells and not to epithelial cells. We propose to: 1) Investigate the roles of DegP, CtpA, EnvC and
LbcA in regulated degradation of the FhaB prodomain, 2) Investigate the relationship between ACT binding to
CR3, regulated degradation of the FhaB prodomain, and delivery of ACT specifically to phagocytic cells, and 3)
Investigate the consequences of dysregulated FhaB prodomain degradation on the establishment and
maintenance of respiratory infection."
10766125,"Air pollutants/irritants evoke dangerous sympathoexcitatory reflexes in individuals with cardiovascular disease
(CVD) but evoke sympathoinhibitory reflexes in healthy subjects. However, there is a major gap in understanding
how irritant-evoked pulmonary-cardiac reflexes are remodeled in CVD. This is significant because it is the reflex
remodeling that determines the impact of pollution and thus the fundamental cause of acute pollutant-evoked
cardiovascular (CV) events, which are responsible for >100k US deaths annually. Thus, there are no clinical
options to treat or identify at-risk individuals. Irritant inhalation triggers pulmonary-cardiac reflexes via the acti-
vation of vagal airway afferent nerves that express transient receptor potential (TRP) ankyrin 1 and vanilloid 1.
TRPs are typically expressed on C- but not A-fibers, which can trigger parasympathetic and sympathetic reflexes,
respectively. The long-term goal is a complete understanding of the mechanisms and networks responsible for
the aberrant pulmonary-cardiac reflexes in CVD. The objective here is to determine the specific afferent and
efferent signaling evoked by airway TRP activation in two CVD rat models and determine the mechanistic cause
of the CVD-linked reflex remodeling. The central hypothesis, based upon strong preliminary data, is that aberrant
irritant-evoked pulmonary-cardiac reflexes in CVD are due to the de novo reflex recruitment of sympathetic ef-
ferent nerves downstream of neurotrophin-dependent remodeling of TRP-expressing airway afferent networks.
The hypothesis is innovative because this is the first time that the basis of the pathophysiology – the remodeling
of pulmonary-cardiac reflexes – has been targeted. Aim 1: Identify the autonomic efferent pathways responsible
for the remodeled airway irritant-evoked reflexes in CVD. We hypothesize that CVD switches irritant-evoked
pulmonary-cardiac reflexes from parasympathetic-mediated bradycardia towards tachyarrhythmia due to de
novo recruitment of cardiac sympathetic efferent nerves. Aim 2: Determine the airway afferent signaling required
for the remodeled irritant-evoked pulmonary-cardiac reflexes in CVD. We hypothesize that irritant-evoked sym-
pathoexcitation in CVD is due to de novo expression of TRPs in airway vagal A-fiber afferents. Aim 3: Determine
the mechanism underlying the remodeling of pulmonary-cardiac reflexes in CVD. We hypothesize that remodel-
ing of pulmonary-cardiac reflexes in CVD is dependent on vagal afferent neurotrophin TrkB receptor activation
downstream of chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). All aims are supported by preliminary
data. This study is significant because it will provide the rationale for pharmacological (e.g. RAS inhibition, TrkB
inhibition, nasal menthol) and electroceutical therapies to reduce the impact of remodeling or reverse the remod-
eling in clinical studies. Our innovative approach will target unique nociceptive subsets and mechanisms in an-
esthetic-free conditions using state-of-the-art electrophysiological techniques. Thus, these studies will have a
transformative impact upon our understanding of irritant-evoked reflexes in CVD, and are expected to lead to a
substantive shift in our approach to reduce the impact of pollutants/irritants on susceptible populations."

 Alcohol abstinence is a key feature of the drinking experience, and relapse – by definition – is shifting from an
abstained state to consumption. Many questions remain unanswered in the literature regarding the physiological
mechanisms and neural signatures of abstinence, and understanding these substrates will be essential for developing
prevention and treatment studies for Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD). The focus of the F99/K00 proposal is an investigation
of central and autonomic nervous system effects associated with alcohol abstinence – in essence, how the brain
responds to a period of imposed abstinence and how autonomic function impacts those responses. Before we can
understand how neural processes associated with abstinence contribute to relapse in AUD patients, we need to
understand what comprises a typical response, and the range of potential responses in otherwise healthy drinkers.
 Typically, physiological research examining alcohol drinkers focuses solely on brain function, discounting the
interplay between central and peripheral nervous system measures. This study examining autonomic nervous system
function, through the peripheral metric Heart Rate Variability (HRV), in addition to examine differences in functional
brain network organization in everyday drinkers during a period of typical alcohol consumption and a period of
abstinence. By examining the relationship between these central and peripheral measures, this study aims to capture a
more complete understanding of the neurobiology associated with alcohol abstinence.
 At the time of this submission, the applicant, under the guidance of the sponsor, has completed all research
design and data collection relevant to the study. Still remaining are analyses investigating the relationship between HRV
and functional brain network connectivity during alcohol cue exposure following abstinence (F99 Phase), which will
require hands‐on and didactic training analyzing HRV and brain network data. Following the completion of the F99
portion of this proposed project, the study will be expanded during a postdoctoral following to include more advanced
analyses of brain network and HRV dynamics (K00 Phase)."
10749016,"ABSTRACT
Reovirus (ReoV) is an enteric dsRNA virus which can infect a wide range of mammals and induce intestinal and
autoimmune diseases due to the cell death elicited during infection. The mechanisms by which ReoV induces
such cell death are unclear. For decades ReoV was thought to cause mainly apoptosis in infected cells. Recently,
the Danthi lab has shown that ReoV can also activate necroptosis, a caspase-independent form of inflammatory
programmed cell death reliant on the kinase RIPK3 and its substrate MLKL. Necroptosis is highly immunogenic
because it results in the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs), and intracellular cytokines, whereas apoptosis is more immunologically ‘silent’. The
mechanisms by which both necroptosis and apoptosis are activated during ReoV infection, as well as the
immunological consequences of this activation, are largely unknown. I have found that the innate immune sensor
Z-DNA Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1) initiates both apoptosis and necroptosis during ReoV infections. I have also
discovered that ReoV generates Z-RNA, the left-handed conformation of double-helical (ds)RNA, in infected
cells. Additionally, I have found that ZBP1 is modified by K63-mediated polyubiquitin linkages during ReoV
infections.
Together, these new findings allow us to hypothesize that (1) ReoV produces cytoplasmic Z-RNAs, which are
activating ligands for ZBP1; (2) ZBP1 ubiquitination is essential for ZBP1 activation, engagement of RIPK3, and
execution of both apoptosis and necroptosis downstream of RIPK3; and (3) ZBP1-triggered necroptosis drives
virus pathogenesis by both promoting virus release and inducing detrimental inflammation in the gut. In this
proposal, we will test these hypotheses by identifying the ReoV-generated Z-RNA ligands for ZBP1 (Aim 1.1),
determining the mechanism and contribution of K63 ubiquitination to ZBP1 activation (Aim 1.2), and investigating
the role ZBP1-activated to host defense and pathogenesis during ReoV infections in vivo, distinguishing between
the contributions of apoptosis and necroptosis to these outcomes (Aim 2). We will also delete ZBP1 and its
downstream pathway effectors in intestinal epithelial cells, the primary ReoV targets in the gut, to determine the
selective role of ZBP1-triggered cell death to ReoV spread and pathogenesis."
10740847,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Colony Stimulating Factor 3 Receptor (CSF3R) is the primary receptor that drives the production of mature
neutrophils, activating signaling pathways to control proliferative and differentiation transcriptional programs.
CSF3R is recurrently mutated in poor-prognosis myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). These mutations activate
CSF3R to enhance signaling through the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways, resulting in an overproduction of
neutrophils. Drug development efforts have been focused on targeting the JAK/STAT activation. However, recent
studies have shown that enhanced MAPK pathway signaling may be equally important in disease pathobiology.
The precise mechanisms by which CSF3R activates the MAPK pathway are not fully understood. Identifying
novel players linking CSF3R to MAPK signaling would offer new therapeutic targets to explore, and allow for a
greater understanding of CSF3R signaling in normal and aberrant hematology.
Using a protein-protein interaction screen, I identified several CSF3R interacting partners that are known to
modulate MAPK pathway activation, including the signaling adapter NCK1. My preliminary data shows that NCK1
plays critical role in activation of the MAPK pathway and is required in CSF3RT618I-driven proliferation. I
hypothesize that NCK1 is an essential regulator of CSF3R-driven MAPK pathway activation and myeloid
proliferation. In Aim 1, I will map the essential regions and residues of CSF3R that are necessary for NCK1 to
potentiate MAPK activation, and establish a role for NCK1 in the control of myeloproliferative transcriptional
programs. In Aim 2 I will investigate how NCK1 controls myeloid differentiation, and determine whether NCK1
expression is required for the biogenesis of CSF3RT618I-driven myeloproliferative neoplasms in vivo. These
experiments will uncover the role of NCK1 in CSF3R-driven MAPK pathway activation and its role in normal and
aberrant hematopoiesis.
This fellowship will prepare me for the next stage in my academic career by providing me with new skills working
with in vivo models and transcriptomics, strengthening my understanding of hematologic disease, and supporting
my professional development. During the NRSA fellowship I will be mentored by Dr. Julia Maxson and Dr. Jeffrey
Tyner, who are exceptional advisors and well poised to support my growth and project development."
10765652,"ABSTRACT
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is significantly correlated with increased risk for developing several
neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD),
representing one of the most powerful environmental risk factors for AD/ADRD. Compounding these correlates
is that aging is a substantial factor in the incidence and vulnerability to TBI. Owing to the complexities surrounding
TBI as a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to AD/ADRD, the cellular mechanisms potentially
underlying the aging brain’s susceptibility to acquire degenerative responses remains elusive. To date, the bulk
of published findings related to TBI-related Alzheimer’s-like impairments have been examined using young adult
and predominantly male rodents, which does not accurately model the greatest at-risk population in humans.
However, our aging TBI model recapitulates several correlates of Alzheimer’s like impairments including chronic
memory impairment, exacerbated neuroinflammation, gliosis, phosphorylated tau, as well as microglial
phenotypes previously documented in both human’s and mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. Guided by
preliminary findings, our overarching hypothesis is that in the aging brain following TBI, RelA drives exacerbated
astrocyte responses, underlying the aging brain’s susceptibility for persistent decremental outcomes related to
homeostatic astrocyte susceptibility, neuroinflammation, and neural network dysfunction. We believe these
altered responses, initiated by TBI in the aging brain ultimately manifest in correlates characteristic of progressive
neurodegeneration associated with AD/ADRD. We will pursue three aims to test this hypothesis using novel
genetic models for targeting astrocytes in young and aged mice to determine 1.) The susceptibility of aged
astrocytes to lose critical homeostatic features following TBI, 2.) The ability of astrocytes to regulate the
conversion of microglia towards decremental AD-associated inflammatory phenotypes following TBI, and 3.) The
role of astrocytes in the vulnerability of synaptic circuitry and impaired memory, a critical hallmark associated
with TBI/ADRD. Cumulatively, these studies will help to elucidate both the cellular and molecular substrates
through which the aging brain’s response to TBI facilitates progressive neurodegenerative sequelae that can
eventually lead to AD/ADRD. Our salient findings will ultimately determine the extent to which RelA is a critical
mediator in these AD-associated sequelae with the potential to elucidate new therapeutic targets toward their
prevention."
10749879,"Background: With the goal of improving Veteran access to timely services, the MISSION Act is shifting the
VA from a tightly integrated system to one that is more “dis-integrated,” with a substantial number of specialty
visits now provided by community providers. The use of VA-purchased community care (VA-CC) could
improve access for Veterans, but could also increase fragmentation of care, potentially resulting in delays,
redundancies, and less coordinated treatment plans. While multiple previous studies have shown a quality
advantage for VA relative to community care (CC), we have little understanding of how fragmentation will
impact timeliness and quality of care, especially for high-risk conditions such as cancer care.
Significance: Fragmented care is a common, serious, and urgent problem for individuals with cancer. This
study, which is responsive to several HSR&D research priorities, will examine the quality of cancer care after
the institution of CHOICE and MISSION, whether the efforts to coordinate VA-CC are successful in
maintaining measured quality, and the degree of risk to quality for patients who divide their care between
systems. Results can be used by our VA partners and Veterans to understand variation and deficits in quality.
Innovation & Impact: This project focuses on systems of care and the potential risks and benefits to quality
when policy incentivizes movement across systems, and develops measures that can be used for monitoring
and targeting efforts to change practice and improve cancer care quality received by Veterans in all settings.
Key products: 1) a report of cancer care quality across VA-delivered and VA-purchased CC; 2) an assessment of
quality for providers in the community who contract with VA relative to geographically proximate providers
who do not; 3) a set of cancer quality measures ready for implementation and new measures identified as
appropriate targets for future implementation; 4) a set of measures requiring further testing and development;
and 5) approaches to enhance implementation in VA and non-VA settings.
Specific Aims: 1. Adapt and extend a set of claims and registry-based measures designed to assess cancer
care quality in national US health systems for use within VA; 2. Compare the quality of cancer care for Veterans
who receive their cancer care within an integrated system to those receiving more fragmented care across
systems, and examine differences in measure performance across key predictor variables; and 3. Conduct a
Stakeholder Expert Panel (SEP) to recommend a cancer performance measurement set for tracking quality of
cancer care in VA and/or non-VA settings and an agenda for near term implementation.
Methodology: We will operationalize previously designed claims-based measures of cancer care in VA data
and extend the measure set (with additional prostate cancer measures). We will compare quality measure
performance for Veterans over 64: 1) Receiving VA-delivered care only vs. receiving any VA-purchased CC; and
those 2) Predominantly reliant on VA care vs. reliant on both VA and Medicare. (Data for these analyses
includes: VA CDW, VA PIT/purchased care, and VA-CMS.) We will also examine, using CMS data, if quality
measure performance is similar for all patients over 64 attending practices under contract with VA to provide
community cancer care to patients attending non-contracted practices within the same hospital referral region.
Finally, we will examine differences in measure performance across key patient and system predictor variables.
Through a Stakeholder Expert Panel, we will prioritize measures, assess gaps in the current measure set and
potential measures to fill those gaps, and recommend approaches for implementation.
Next Steps/Implementation: Through the work of the Advisory Council and Stakeholder Expert Panel,
which involve both VA and non-VA experts, we will create a multi-step process for dissemination of the
research products. By engaging policy makers in the process of decision making, the results will be more
implementable and sustainable."

We will use innovative social epidemiological methods to longitudinally characterize the impacts and
mechanisms of gender-based violence on the HIV care continuum, define key components of differentiated
HIV care models that mitigate these relationships and develop a platform for trauma- and violence-informed
HIV care and practice (TVI-HCP) interventions, among cisgender (cis) and transgender (trans) women living
with HIV (WLWH). Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in heightened
social and structural gender-based violence against cis and trans women, who are shouldering an inequitable
share of the resulting impact of restrictions, physical distancing and economic downtown. Impacts felt by
marginalized cis and trans women, including WLWH, are even more severe and the short- and long-term
consequences in terms of trauma, violence, safety and HIV care continuum outcomes of cis and trans WLWH
will need to be addressed. Even prior to COVID-19 crisis, despite substantial programmatic advancements,
WLWH experienced gaps relative to cisgender men in all global HIV targets in many settings. Although the
global prevalence of social and structural violence by WLWH is alarmingly high, there is a lack of research
delineating mechanisms through which different types of violence impact HIV care continuum outcomes, to
inform intervention targets. Moreover, despite calls to apply a trauma-and violence-informed care approach to
HIV care and practice (TVI-HCP) and the unique needs of WLWH, surprisingly little is known about how this
approach can be tailored in HIV clinical practice environments. In the proposed study we will leverage an
existing community-based cohort of cis and trans WLWH in a Canadian setting (Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS:
Women's Longitudinal Needs Assessment) and recapture and expand this cohort to 300 WLWH in the City of
Vancouver. This quantitative study will include survey interviews, innovative mapping and spatial analyses, HIV
disease monitoring, and confidential administrative linkages to fill critical research gaps and inform
components of multi-level TVI-HCP programming to optimize HIV care continuum outcomes by: (1)
Prospectively characterizing relationships between different types of violence experiences (interpersonal
emotional, physical and sexual violence; neighbourhood violence) and viral load suppression failure and
identifying critical mediators in these relationships on which to intervene; (2) Prospectively characterizing the
key components of differentiated HIV care models that have the strongest associations with viral load
suppression, expanding on our preliminary development and validation of a TVI-HCP Scale for WLWH; and (3)
Establishing an innovative social epidemiological platform for informing and evaluating future multi-level
trauma- and violence-informed HIV care interventions. Amidst the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, in parallel with a
syndemic of violence, trauma and HIV in North America, our study offers an unprecedented opportunity to
inform differentiated HIV care models to optimize HIV clinical outcomes among marginalized women."
10747881,"Neurodegenerative disease is among the greatest unmet challenges being faced in healthcare today. Such disease is devastating to families and an enormous economic burden. These disorders include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and the clinically- and pathologically-related disorders frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite tremendous medical advances that have extended lifespan, degenerative disease remains formidable with a huge impact on healthspan. Novel approaches and innovative applications are needed to provide biological insight into these diseases and the foundation for therapeutic advances. Drosophila melanogaster is a remarkable model organism with biological pathways highly conserved to humans, a complex brain and nervous system, and a staggering array of genetic and molecular biological approaches for gene and pathway discovery and manipulation. We propose to apply the power of Drosophila to understand genes and mechanisms that underlie neurodegenerative disease. Our special current focus is on the genetic and biological underpinnings of ALS/FTD. ALS is a devastating motor neuron disease that leads to rapid paralysis and death. FTD is the second most common form of dementia. Drosophila research has already provided many striking insights into the biological mechanisms of these diseases, while more basic insights are still needed. We have developed, and will continue to develop, models for familial disease. Our unique, interdisciplinary approach launches from a fly model, which we use to identify pathways of interest by performing genetics screens for modifiers of the disease toxicity. We then extend the findings from Drosophila into human patient tissue, mammalian cells, and primary neurons in culture, ultimately returning our in vivo fly model for detailed mechanistic insight. In addition to genetic studies, we currently plan on using the fly to assess the impact of critical risk factors, such as traumatic brain damage and the gut microbiota, the impacts of which can be difficult, or impossible, to interrogate in mammalian models or cells. Thus, launching from Drosophila, our research program strives to provide novel avenues for the understanding of disease and the foundation for therapeutic insight toward the enormous burden of neurodegenerative disease facing society today."
10745341,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This research proposal is intended to provide predoctoral and postdoctoral training to develop the necessary
skills for a career as an independent investigator in cancer biology. The long-term research focus is development
of effective therapy for pancreatic cancer (PC) through 1) determining the contribution of cancer stem cells
(CSCs) to PC progression and metastasis, 2) understanding the mechanism of CSC maintenance and CSC-
mediated drug resistance, 3) identifying genetic, epigenetic, and metabolic factors essential for CSC
maintenance with the aim of identifying novel epigenetic and metabolic targets that can be exploited for
combinatorial therapy against PC. The objective of my dissertation research (F99 phase) is to define the role
of Pancreatic Differentiation 2 (PD2) in pancreatic CSCs and CSC-mediated PC progression, with the goal of
deciphering the mechanism of PD2-dependent CSC maintenance. PD2 is a ubiquitous multifunctional protein, a
core component of human RNA Polymerase II-Associated Factor 1 complex (PAF1C) that functions in
transcription elongation and mRNA processing. We discovered that PD2 is a novel pancreatic CSC marker and
mediates drug resistance of CSCs. Knowledge of the molecular mechanism of PD2-dependent CSC
maintenance and drug resistance is critical. We have recently made several discoveries relevant to this concept.
First, knockdown of PD2 significantly reduces the levels of established CSC and self-renewal markers.
Importantly, PD2 depletion significantly reduces tumor burden in vivo. Moreover, RNA-sequencing and
transcription factor PCR array analyses revealed that several stemness and metastasis genes were significantly
downregulated following PD2 depletion. Based on aforementioned information and additional data, we
hypothesize that PD2 functions as a master-regulator of stem cell maintenance and thereby mediates
PC progression. Our research will utilize high throughput genomic techniques such as chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-sequencing in presence and absence of PD2 to define downstream
targets of PD2, and identify the pathway for PD2-dependent maintenance of pancreatic CSCs. We will also
determine the role of PD2 in CSC-mediated PC progression using a novel CRISPR- based PD2 knockout model
crossed with KPC model of PC progression. To expand upon the future research direction and to build the
foundation for independence, I will pursue postdoctoral training in cancer metabolism. The goal of the proposed
K00 postdoctoral training is to gain expertise on :1) the current metabolomic strategies; 2) understand the
mechanisms that promote acquisition of different metabolic programs by CSCs and differentiated tumor cells; 3)
contribution of metabolism to CSC-mediated drug resistance; and 4) development of novel combinatorial
therapeutics based on metabolic targeting to treat cancer. Ultimately, the proposed F99/K00 training will provide
a strong intellectual foundation for R01 funding that will establish my independence and will provide professional
training in the skills required to be an effective PI and mentor."
10729512,"Background. Alcohol use is a significant risk factor of disability and death for U.S. adults and one out of every
six Veteran seen in primary care (PC) report unhealthy alcohol use. Unhealthy drinking is associated with
increased risk for poor medical outcomes, substantial societal costs, and death, including suicide. Based on
substantial evidence from randomized controlled trials and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, VA/DoD
clinical guidelines stipulate that all Veterans screening positive for unhealthy alcohol use should receive
evidence-based alcohol care in PC, including brief counseling interventions (BI) and additional treatment (e.g.,
pharmacotherapy) for those with alcohol use disorders (AUD). The VA was a pioneer in implementing alcohol
screening and BI in PC, yet substantial implementation gaps remain. Approximately 25% of Veterans with
unhealthy alcohol use still do not receive BIs and evidence suggests that the quality of BIs is lacking. For those
with AUD, BI implementation has not appeared to increase access to recommended services (e.g., referrals) nor
reduced barriers to pharmacotherapy. In order to improve the quality and fidelity of alcohol-related care, the
current research proposes to use an evidence-based implementation strategy, practice facilitation, at one VA to
pilot test whether practice facilitation has the potential to improve quality of PC-based alcohol-related care.
Significance/Impact. This research directly addresses one of the largest public health crises of our time, as
alcohol kills more people than opioids and is associated with increased risk of suicide. Thus, this work may have
far-reaching effects on adverse outcomes experienced by Veterans and is aligned with top HSRD and VA
priorities, including increased access to care and suicide prevention. Innovation. The project will use innovative
implementation techniques not previously used to improve VA alcohol-related care. Specific Aims. Aim 1 is a
qualitative study assessing Veteran and PC stakeholders to understand barriers and facilitators to high-quality
alcohol care and use results to refine and hone the practice facilitation intervention. Aim 2 will deliver the practice
facilitation intervention in a small PC sample to examine its acceptability and feasibility. Aim 3 is a pilot test of
the practice facilitation intervention in the full PC clinic to understand whether practice facilitation improves quality
of PC-based alcohol-related care. Methodology. Aim 1 will recruit and interview Veterans with unhealthy alcohol
use (n=20-25) and PC stakeholders (N=10-15) to help refine the practice facilitation. Aim 2 will deliver the
practice facilitation among a small sample of PC providers and staff (n=5-7) to assess acceptability/feasibility. In
Aim 3, PC providers/staff from the full clinic will be invited to participate in the practice facilitation in order to
assess implementation (e.g., reach) and effectiveness (reduced drinking) outcomes. Implementation/Next
Steps. Findings will be presented to local and national operational partners and used to improve evidence-based
alcohol-related care nationally across VA PC. Candidate. Dr. Rachel Bachrach is a clinical psychologist and
postdoctoral research fellow in the Interprofessional Advanced Fellowship in Addiction Treatment based within
the Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion (CHERP), a VA HSR&D Research Center of Excellence.
The purpose of this CDA-2 is to facilitate Dr. Bachrach’s transition to an independent HSR&D investigator with
a long-term objective of improving evidence-based care for addictive disorders. The short-term objective is to
obtain formal training, expert mentorship, and research experience to facilitate a VA HSR&D career focused on
improving prevention and intervention efforts within PC for Veterans who screen positive for unhealthy alcohol
use. Mentorship will provide focused training on goals relevant for both the current CDA-2 research project and
for Dr. Bachrach’s career as an independent scientist, including in-depth training in (1) implementation science;
(2) alcohol-related care; (3) qualitative methods for intervention development; and (4) intervention design and

Immune mediated kidney diseases cause substantial morbidity and often lead to progressive renal failure.
Immune complexes (ICs) have been found in podocytes in a variety of immune mediated kidney diseases but it
is not known how podocytes handle immune complexes and whether trafficking of immune complexes in
podocytes exacerbates glomerulonephritis. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) correctly sorts and traffics ICs in a
variety of cells including podocytes. FcRn is also required to traffic immune complexes to the lysosome in
dendritic cells for proteolytic processing and presentation on MHC II. In preliminary studies, we have found that
podocyte specific knockout of FcRn protects in two models of immune mediated nephritis but that this protection
is not conferred by an immune mediated mechanism. While there is no difference in any of the immune
parameters examined, we have found that there is significantly less apoptotic cell death and upregulation of
apoptotic pathways in FcRn knockout (KO) podocytes treated with immune complexes and significantly
decreased apoptosis in the glomeruli of podocyte specific FcRn KO mice after induction of nephrotoxic serum
nephritis (NTS). In addition, we have found significantly less lysosomal activation and less upregulation of
lysosomal enzymes in FcRn KO podocytes treated with immune complexes. Since FcRn is required to traffic
immune complexes to the lysosome, we hypothesize that in immune mediated nephritis, FcRn directed trafficking
of ICs to the lysosome results in lysosomal dysfunction, upregulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and
podocyte death. To test this hypothesis we will directly examine lysosomal structure and function in WT and
FcRn KO podocytes after an immune challenge using both advanced imaging techniques and biochemical
methods. We will also examine whether FcRn mediated trafficking of immune complexes to the lysosome results
in increased lysosomal permeability and leakage of lysosomal cathepsins into the cytosol causing degradation
of mitochondrial membrane integrity, leakage of cytochrome c and upregulation of intrinsic apoptotic pathways.
We will test whether podocyte specific knockout of FcRn results in decreased lysosomal activation and improved
lysosomal function in podocytes in vivo after induction of immune mediated kidney disease (NTS) and whether
this in turn results in less apoptotic cell death, an increased number of viable podocytes and less severe disease
as assessed by functional and histologic parameters. Since upregulation of lysosomal cathepsins correlates with
more severe lupus nephritis in patients, we will also examine whether podocyte specific knockout of FcRn
ameliorates lupus nephritis in a spontaneous mouse model of this disease. Taken together, the proposed work
will provide novel insights into FcRn mediated trafficking of immune complexes in podocytes and may allow for
the creation of targeted therapies to slow or prevent progression of immune mediated glomerulonephritis."

 Despite its long history, the nutrient biology field is still facing a plethora of outstanding questions closely
related to human health, two of which will be explored in this proposal. First, the nutrient value of many
specific molecules in our diet, or the beneficial impact of many specific bacterial metabolites on human
physiology (as predicted by the symbiotic relationship between commensal microbes and host animals),
remain unclear. Second, whereas great advances have been made in the last decades on understanding
signaling systems that sense the levels of glucose, amino acids and other well-studied nutrients to regulate
various physiological events, the mechanisms that respond to the level of many other specific nutrients,
including certain fatty acids, nucleotide variants and micronutrients, are largely unexplored.
 About 6 years ago, our lab boldly moved the major research direction to study problems related to
nutrient functions and sensing, focusing mainly on under-explored fatty acid variants, nucleotides and
bacterial metabolites, using the nematode C. elegans as the primary model with additional analysis in mice
and mammalian cells. In one aspect, we developed innovative assays to identify the unknown beneficial
impact of bacterial metabolites, including the siderophore enterobactin and bacterial cell wall components
peptidoglycan (PG), on animal development and behaviors. Under this MIRA grant, we will carry out a
thorough investigation of the newly discovered beneficial roles of PG fragments that have mainly been the
subject of immune defense studies in the past. By analyzing the structure of potent PG fragments, their
impacts on various aspects of animal physiology, and the interacting host factors, we aim to uncover the
mechanism of this fascinating new role of bacterial PG.
 In the other aspect, our effort in recent years has uncovered four novel regulatory systems that sense
the deprivation of specific fatty acid and nucleotide variants to regulate developmental and behavioral
events to protect animals’ reproductive fitness. In particular, our study under the existing GM R01 grant
uncovered an intestine-initiated pathway that regulates germ cell proliferation and metabolism in response
to pyrimidine deficiency. Under this MIRA grant, we will address critical mechanistic questions surrounding
the roles of an obscure endonuclease that increases its expression in response to nucleotide imbalance and
that acts in the intestine to regulate metabolic and developmental events.
 Past research in the C. elegans field has indicated that this organism is best used to make novel
discoveries that present important conceptual advances in biology. With promising preliminary data, the
projects described in this MIRA application have great potential to make paradigm-shifting discoveries that
would impact our understanding of the nutritional value of microbiota-produced molecules and the diversity
of nutrient-sensing mechanisms."

Skeletal muscle is central to the development of metabolic dysfunction during type 2 diabetes (T2D) and
obesity. In addition, these conditions are often accompanied by accelerated muscle loss despite the presence
of nutrient excess. This suggests uncoupling of nutrient sensing mechanisms with the molecular pathways that
control muscle plasticity. For instance, depletion of intramuscular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is
linked to skeletal muscle loss and dysfunction, while strategies that restore or increase its levels can reverse
this pathogenesis. Particularly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases 1
(PARP1), a major NAD consumer, improves muscle fitness through increases in NAD availability and the
activation of NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1). Thus, identifying physiological pathways that link
energy metabolism to the regulation of PARP1 activity can lead to the development of innovative therapies for
the prevention or treatment of muscle degeneration and metabolic dysfunction. Preliminary data suggest that
direct sensing of circulating glucose by sweet taste receptors (STRs) regulates PARP1 activity to control the
adaptive potential of skeletal muscle. Specifically, whole body or skeletal muscle-specific deletion of T1r2 gene
of STRs (T1R2-KO) enhances mitochondrial function, oxidative capacity, exercise tolerance, and induces mild
increases in myofiber size. These improvements are linked to attenuated PARP1 activity, increased NAD pool,
and enhanced glucose utilization towards nucleotide biosynthesis. Consequently, T1R2-KO mice are protected
from metabolic derangements associated with diet-induced obesity, including muscle mass loss. Thus, it was
hypothesized that the T1R2 receptor is a constitutive sensor of glucose availability to adjust intracellular
pathways that control the metabolic basis of skeletal muscle plasticity. This hypothesis is tested through
comprehensive studies using mice with constitutive or inducible muscle-specific deletion of the T1r2 gene to: 1)
Elucidate the role of T1R2 signaling network in the regulation of muscle bioenergetics and function.
Specifically, a) probe signaling pathway leading to PARP1 regulation and NAD bioavailability, b) identify
downstream effectors of NAD-dependent activation of SIRT1 and 2, c) assess contributions of STRs in the
regulation of substrate utilization, and d) determine interactions between STR signaling and established
intracellular energy sensors (i.e. AMPK, mTORC1, Akt). 2) Investigate contributions of T1R2-mediated glucose
sensing in the regulation of muscle mass. Specifically, a) assess physiological effects of inducible deletion of
STR signaling in adult skeletal muscle to mimic longitudinal effects of pharmacological treatments targeting
STRs, b) define contributions of STR signaling to muscle mass adaptations in response to treatments that
induce muscle hypertrophy or atrophy, c) spatiotemporal expression of T1r2 gene during muscle development
and growth using muscle-specific reporter mice, and d) contributions of STR signaling during postnatal muscle
growth through the assessment of morphological, signaling and functional muscle adaptations.

10762977,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a potent neurotransmitter produced in the islet at levels as high as in the brain. While the function of GABA in the nervous system is well-understood, the description of the islet GABA system is clouded by dozens of antithetical reports describing differing secretion pathways and effector functions. It is now clear that GABA does not directly regulate beta cell mass, so GABA’s ultimate role in the islet remains unresolved. We recently described a new mechanism for GABA secretion from human islets that challenges the 30-year-old conceptual status quo that islet GABA secretion occurs via synaptic-like vesicles. Instead, beta cells release GABA directly from the cytosol via volume regulated anion channels (VRACs). Next, we showed that beta cells release GABA in regular pulses that provide periodic feedback to help synchronize hormone secretion. GABA is also metabolized in the beta cell through a pathway called the GABA-shunt, which can accelerate ATP production. We conducted pharmacological studies to manipulate GABA synthesis and catabolism, which profoundly impacted glucose-responsive insulin secretion. These results establish that GABA is important for normal islet function. From here, our Aims over the next five years are to (1) analyze the detailed mechanism of GABA efflux from human beta cells and (2) determine the overall role of GABA in glycemic control. Our approach implements two strains of Cre-Lox conditional knockout mice: beta cell-specific deletion of VRAC, the channel responsible for GABA release; and beta cell-specific deletion of GAD67, the enzyme responsible for GABA biosynthesis. The latter model represents the first example of an islet-specific GABA-null mouse. These models will be combined with technological innovations including GABA biosensor cells, islet-on-a-chip microfluidic devices, and optical probes for cytosolic Ca2+, membrane potential, and VRAC activity to dynamically measure islet GABA release and its functional effects. We will validate our conclusions in human islets including the use of live human pancreas organotypic slices. This research has relevance for human health. We previously found that GABA content and secretion are impaired in human islets from donors with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, suggesting GABA levels correlate with diabetes pathogenesis. Our proposed work will establish if there is a causal linkage between GABA and islet function. If successful in elucidating GABA mechanisms that affect islet hormone secretion, existing pharmaceuticals that modulate GABA systems can be proposed as novel intervention strategies to promote islet function in diabetes prevention or management. The immediate impact of this study will be to finally bring clarity to the role and mechanisms of the GABA system in islets. However, this research has broader impacts that extend to other neurotransmitters (VRAC is also permeable to glycine, glutamine, and taurine) and other cell type that utilize GABA including neurons, glial cells, enteroendocrine cells, and immune cells. Our team has extensive knowledge of human islet biology and unique technical expertise to succeed in this endeavor."
10755608,"Background: Seriously-ill veterans rely on spiritual and existential beliefs to cope with their
illness, support their quality of life, and make critical healthcare decisions. As a result, VHA
(Directive 1111) and other major health care organizations mandate spiritual assessments. With
VA funding, our research team developed and validated the first quantifiable spiritual screening
tool designed specifically for seriously-ill Veterans, VET-Spirit. The crucial next step is integrating
screening and response to spiritual needs into serious illness care. This proposal develops and
evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of implementing VET-Spirit, which systematically
measures spiritual needs and subsequently equips providers with spiritual needs data into
clinical care. VET-Spirit includes a curated summary of VET-Spirit patient response data to
providers with communication prompts to aid in discussions of unmet needs. We hypothesize:
80% of veteran enrollees will complete VET-Spirit measure; 75% of providers rate AIM, FIM and
IAM items at a mean of four or above on a five-point likert scale indicating agreement with
acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness of the implementation strategy. Significance/
Impact: While the VHA mandates spiritual care, VA’s use neither a common: 1) screening tool,
or 2) process for integrating identified needs into care. VET-Spirit includes both. Innovation: 1)
Ensuring Compliance - No previous intervention has been designed to assess the spiritual
needs and resources of seriously-ill veterans, curate that information, and deliver it to the care
team. Integrating an actionable spiritual screening tool into the stream of care enhances care
coordination and places the VA at the forefront of care of seriously-ill veterans. 2) Spiritual Care
Accountability - VET-Spirit creates and evaluates a process for patient-centered care by
integrating screening of spiritual beliefs into serious illness decision-making. 3) Whole Patient
Care – VET-Spirit serves as a model for integrating patient voices into care. Specific Aims:
Aim 1) Identify what and how providers (physicians, palliative care and POSH teams, chaplains)
want to receive data on Veterans’ spirital needs. Determine content, format, barriers and
facilitators to spiritual needs information delivery and its integration into care. Aim 2) Evaluate
the feasibility and acceptability of VET-Spirit among providers of seriously-ill veterans (e.g. stage
IV cancer, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Methodology: Aim
1 - qualitative methods of focus groups and in-depth interviews and directed content analyses of
those data will inform: work flow considerations, information delivery location, content, format,
conversation prompts, additional facilitators and barriers, and provider self-efficacy. Aim 2 -
qualitative and quantitative methods to determine VET-Spirit feasibility and acceptability.
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all quantitative measures as well as trend change
scores in outcomes (e.g., provider self-efficacy, knoweldge). Acceptabiltiy and feasiblity
measures include: rates of VET-Spirit provider participation, veteran participants accrued,
enrolled and retained, number of VET-Spirit completions, number of chaplain referrals and visits,
acceptability if implementation measure (AIM), feasibility of implementation measure (FIM) and
implementation appropriateness measure (IAM) scores; and provider satisfaction with tool ease,
efficiency and self-efficacy in spiritual care communications (assessed qualitatively). Next
Steps: Results of this pilot will fill the datagap in spiritual care delivery and inform a large scale
Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation Trial of VET-Spirit."
10754864,"REACH is an 8-week pipeline summer course for minorities and underrepresented college and high school students interested in careers in neuroscience. Developed, together with Drs. Jenny Libien, MD, Ph.D., and Juan Marcos Alarcon, Ph.D., the Research Experience in Autism for College and High School students (REACH) summer program, provides underrepresented college students an advantage in pursuing a career in the biomedical fields. The REACH course is a research centric program with supplementary modules aimed at enhancing the participants’ knowledge of neurological disorders with emphasis in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) through comprehensive lectures and clinical experiences. Students also receive instruction in career development with emphasis in mental health disparities and cultural competence. These experiences will inform the student-generated hypotheses and project that the students will develop throughout the summer. The program recruits basic science investigators, physicians, clinicians and graduate (PhD and medical students) students as REACH mentors. Utilizing team-based and peer-mentoring strategies, the student participants with the aid of their dedicated faculty and graduate student mentors will develop research hypotheses regarding ASD that they will experimentally resolve by the conclusion of the 8-week program. By exposing the participants to a diverse population of mentors, we hope to impress upon them the path and attainability of a life in the neuroscience and biomedical fields. Our program’s long-term goal is twofold, first to increase access and retention of underrepresented minorities into the neuroscience/biomedical field. Second, to positively impact underrepresented communities through our students."
10750937,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, alcohol sales, use and related hospitalizations have dramatically
increased, disproportionately affecting minority communities. Alcohol impairs intestinal barrier function through
changes in tight junction protein expression. Alcohol-induced intestinal permeability leads to endotoxin from gut
microbes leaking out and traveling through portal circulation to prime the liver for injury. The aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AhR), a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor involved in the clearance of xenobiotics and
maintenance of immune cell function, has been implicated in the maintenance of intestinal barrier function. AhR
activation with dietary ligands has been shown to improve intestinal barrier function in models of inflammation.
Furthermore, alcohol-induced gut permeability and liver injury have been shown to be partially attenuated with
AhR ligands. However, these limited studies have not examined the role of cell specific AhR signaling in the
maintenance of intestinal barrier function in response to alcohol. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the
combination of intestinal epithelial specific (IEC) AhR knockout and treatment with the AhR ligand β-
naphthoflavone (BNF) provides protection against alcohol induced gut permeability and liver injury. We
observed i) decrease in ethanol-induced endotoxemia (intestinal permeability marker), ii) decrease in the
induction of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT; hepatic injury marker), and iii) induction of AhR target genes
in ileal mucosa. Previous studies have shown that intestinal epithelial AhR regulates availability of dietary AhR
ligands to immune cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that the absence of intestinal epithelial AhR increases
the availability of AhR ligands to intestinal immune cells, leading to an increase in immune AhR
signaling, and IL-10 and IL-22 mediated improvement in ethanol induced intestinal barrier permeability
and subsequent protection to liver injury. The studies proposed in Specific Aim 1 will elucidate the
mechanisms of intestinal epithelial and immune cell specific AhR on alcohol mediated gut permeability—with
focus on differences between the small and large intestines—and liver injury using intestinal epithelial and
immune cell specific AhR knockout mice. These studies will also delineate the ethanol induced changes in
microbial metabolites and their role in AhR activation by reporter assays. Specific Aim 2 will utilize state-of-the-
art intestinal epithelial enteroid-immune cell co-cultures to study the crosstalk between IECs and immune cells
in mediating alcohol induced gut permeability. Overall, the successful completion of the proposed work could
have profound implications for the treatment of intestinal barrier contributing liver injury such as in alcoholic liver
disease. All experiments will consider variations that may arise from sex differences, with attention to statistics
and reproducibility. The proposed studies will provide comprehensive training for the applicant and identify novel
therapeutic targets to aid intestinal barrier function and allow for intervention in alcohol use disorder."
10746431,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) maintains its status as one of most lethal solid cancers with
a 5-year survival of 8%. Minor improvements have been attributed to early detection, but the vast majority of
patients face a grim prognosis without effective therapeutic intervention. Molecular analysis of patient samples
has often been confounded by mixed biological samples, leading to reproducibility challenges. Previously, our
lab performed virtual microdissection on bulk RNA-seq patient samples establishing robust prognostic gene
signatures describing an aggressive basal-like and drug-responsive classical tumor subtypes highlighting the
importance of cancer heterogeneity across patients. Using these signatures as patient classifiers has been an
important utility in preliminary clinical trials and therapeutic profiling of patient derived organoids.
 Building evidence suggests patient unique TME composition impacts PDAC progression and resistance
to standard treatments. While patient tissue characterization with bulk measurements has provided key insights
into cancer biology, parsing the complex tumor microenvironments requires higher resolution due to the
widespread stromal involvement and sparse neoplastic populations. Single-cell sequencing delivers the
analytical power to help identify variable TME elements between patients that lead to the distinct prognostic and
therapeutic responses. Thus, understanding the extent and role of TME heterogeneity in PDAC across patient
tumor subtypes is paramount to widen the door for personalized medicine in oncology.
 In this proposal, I will establish a comprehensive single-cell atlas of human PDAC TME to significantly
lower the barrier between researchers and complex single-cell transcriptomics data to explore novel prognostic
and synergistic therapeutic targets. I will use local and public single cell RNA-seq data of PDAC tissue to
investigate the extent and role of cellular heterogeneity across patient tumor subtypes. Specifically, I will define
molecular signatures and map out the interactome of functional cell types within stromal, lymphocytic, myeloid
populations at unprecedented spatial resolution. Ultimately, by integrating high-dimensional data from single-cell
RNA-seq and Spatial Transcriptomics, this work will shed light on the intricate tissue pathology while laying down
a broad framework for understanding multi-axis cell interactions behind progression and resistance in diverse
cancer types."
10731066,"The long-term goal of this proposed career development award (CDA-2) is to accelerate my training and
development so that I can establish an independent line of research unraveling the causes and consequences
of fatigue and to develop effective evidence-based therapies for fatigue in Veterans with neurological conditions.
Before my collegiate studies, I served nine years on active duty in the United States Marine Corps and received
an Honorable Discharge upon the expiration of my service contract. I completed my Ph.D. in Human
Bioenergetics at Colorado State University in 2017. Upon graduation, I began a post-doctoral position at the
Medical University of South Carolina working with Dr. Mark G. Bowden, PT, Ph.D. Shortly after starting my post-
doc position, I acquired a WOC appointment at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center and was awarded a
VA Rehabilitation Research and Development Career Development Award – 1 that began in Oct 2019. Since
the beginning of my research journey, I have published 22 peer-reviewed manuscripts, 12 as the first author. My
most recent publications have centered on measuring the neurophysiological state of the nervous system and
relating that state to post-stroke disability. These most recent manuscripts are based on data collected at the
laboratories at Ralph H. Johnson before my arrival and the co-authors include several of the members of this
proposal’s mentorship team. Upon completing my CDA-1 (end date Sep 30, 2021), I have focused my attention
on the neurophysiological biomarkers of post-stroke fatigue. This CDA-2 proposal will provide me with the
opportunity to learn new neurophysiological assessment methods and advance my knowledge and ability to
apply neuromodulatory treatments. These skills will provide me the foundation to build an independent VA-
backed research program focusing on reducing the impact of fatigue in Veterans with an array of neurological
conditions. The assembled mentorship team is composed of experts in post-stroke rehabilitation,
neuromodulation, neuroimaging, and clinical assessment. Up to 92% of people post-stroke experience fatigue.
Fatigue negatively affects physical and mental performance leading to a lower quality of life. Fatigue is also
present in many other neurological populations within the Veteran community, such as traumatic brain injury,
multiple sclerosis, and the newly coined phenomenon of Long-COVID. Advances in the knowledge and
understanding of post-stroke fatigue are likely to lead to advances in other clinical populations within the Veteran
community. The first aim is to test the effects of a well-established neuromodulatory therapy, repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), on reducing the severity of post-stroke fatigue. This aim is predicated
on theoretical principles obtained from the study of other neuro-psychiatric/-cognitive disorders and therapeutic
attempts to reduce fatigue in other neurological illnesses. Participating Veterans will receive high-frequency
rTMS to the frontal lobe, either the left prefrontal dorsolateral cortex or bilaterally to the motor cortices. These
locations have been implicated in fatigue in other neurological conditions. I expect to show rTMS can be used to
reduce post-stroke fatigue severity. However, the effectiveness and location of treatment may partially be
dependent on individual characteristics. The second aim of the study is based on the skills and knowledge
developed in the CDA-1, I plan on identifying additional neurophysiological biomarkers of fatigue. In this project,
I will assess glutamatergic activity/signaling of the upper and lower extremity sensorimotor network of Veterans
with and without post-stroke fatigue. I expect to show that the fatigued group will show glutamatergic dysfunction,
measured by greater asymmetries in intracortical facilitation and the facilitatory response to paired associative
stimulation, compared to the non-fatigued group. Identification of glutamate and related metabolites as a
pathophysiological contributor to post-stroke fatigue may help in the development of new therapeutic approaches
for post-stroke fatigue and fatigue in other neurological conditions."
10535517,"Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an evidence-based secondary prevention program for patients with
cardiovascular disease (CVD) that aims to stabilize patients clinically and to restore physical function and
health after a CVD event. It is well-suited to the needs of the aging Veterans Health Administration’s (VHA)
aging population which is prone to CVD in a context of comorbidity, frailty, and associated functional decline.
Unfortunately, few eligible Veterans participate. Logistic challenges are a key barrier as few VHA site-based
CR programs are available. The Promising Practice home-based CR (HBCR) is a VHA initiative that was
designed to improve CR participation using a novel home-based approach. While HBCR has been
demonstrated to be effective for Veterans who attend, only few participate. Many Veterans eligible for HBCR
remain encumbered by comorbidity and frailty, and often lack confidence and/or perceived capacity for home-
based formats of care. The Transition to CR (T2CR) intervention is a 2-phase program that aims to improve
the process of HBCR and to thereby better respond to Veterans’ needs. T2CR Phase 1 is a ~2 day face-to-
face program between the initial CVD hospitalization and home that includes comprehensive assessment of
holistic risks (CVD and non-CVD), functional limitations, and psychosocial circumstances. Individualized
pragmatic plans are formulated to ensure HBCR is feasible, safe, and practical despite aggregate complexity.
Goal setting, adherence reinforcements, and education are integrated; exercise practice is emphasized; and
consultations for comorbid issues and telemedicine video facilitation are arranged. T2CR Phase 2 is HBCR
that is enriched by the orientation, practice, consultations, supports, and goal setting that were initiated in
T2CR Phase 1, as well as innovative exercise training techniques for patients who are frail and/or functionally
impaired. T2CR is aligned with the already existing Coordinated Transitional Care (C-TraC) Program. C-TraC
nurse practitioners currently hone medication management, medical follow-up, and education as hospitalized
Veterans transition to home, but do little to guide recovery of physical function. By facilitating referral to the
T2CR intervention, C-TraC care will be enhanced. Using a hybrid efficacy-implementation (type 1) design, we
propose a randomized controlled trial to study T2CR versus usual HBCR in the VA Pittsburgh and Boston
Healthcare Systems. Quantitative endpoints will include functional gains (assessed using the Activity Measure
for Post-Acute Care [AM-PAC CAT]) over 365 days as well as a 5-Times Sit-To-Stand performance measure.
The number of CR sessions attended, rehospitalizations, and Healthy Days at Home will be assessed.
Patients’ perceptions of feasibility and acceptability of T2CR will be also be evaluated. Providers’ perceptions
of will be evaluated as well; the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) framework will
be used to structure their insights. Patient and provider feedback will be applied to refine implementation
strategies with the goal to ultimately extend T2CR throughout the entire ORH Promising Practices network."
10760313,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is typically defined by the accumulation of beta-
amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, synaptic loss and neuronal degeneration, the disease is not
restricted to the gray matter. Neuroimaging and neuropathological studies have documented a significant loss
of white matter in AD, which begins early in the disease course and is correlated with cognitive decline. In
addition to contributions of hypoperfusion-related ischemic injury and neurodegeneration-associated axonal
loss, emerging evidence indicates a decline and dysfunction of oligodendrocyte populations as additional
factors in this multifactorial white matter disease process. Oligodendrocytes are the most abundant glial cell
type in the brain, but are the least studied cell population in the context of neurodegeneration despite their vital
role for myelin maintenance and neuronal support. With the increasing recognition of the role of myelin in AD, it
becomes important to understand the genetic and molecular factors that link oligodendrocytes to the AD
process. Our knowledge about genetic variants contributing to overall AD risk and influencing AD-associated
endophenotypes is accelerating. Our proposal is designed to bring these two lines of investigation together and
begin to explore genetic modifiers of oligodendrocyte and myelin abnormalities in AD and underlying molecular
mechanisms using a quantitative trait approach of neuropathologically defined myelin endophenotypes.
 The central hypothesis of our proposal is that loss of myelin integrity and oligodendrocyte
dysfunction in AD are associated with genetic variants and molecular changes. We will test this
hypothesis by first performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of white and gray matter
neuropathological endophenotypes in human postmortem brain tissue samples and will then conduct bulk and
spatially defined gene expression studies to explore underlying molecular mechanisms. Our experiments are
divided into two specific aims: Aim 1) To determine genetic modifiers of myelin and oligodendrocyte
pathologies in AD. Aim 2) To determine associations between white matter gene expression changes and
white matter pathologies in AD.
 The above aims benefit from the tight integration and leveraging of a diverse group of investigators with
expertise in the neuropathology of AD and digitally quantified pathology endophenotypes (PI Kofler), AD-
associated oligodendrocyte pathology (Co-I Herrup), GWAS data analysis (Co-Is Kamboh and Fan),
biostatistical analysis of transcriptomics datasets (Co-I Ding) and digital image analysis and machine learning
(Co-I Pearce). Upon completion of our proposed studies, we will have identified novel candidate genes as
mediators of myelin pathology in AD, increased our understanding about the biology underlying their linkage to
AD and revealed novel targets for therapeutic interventions. As our study design includes separate analyses of
gray and white matter regions and stratification by sex, we will have further delineated regional and sex-
specific differences in myelin and oligodendrocyte pathobiology in the context of AD."

This is an application for a K24 mentoring award for patient-oriented research (POR) from Julio Chirinos, MD,
PhD, Associate Professor of Medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania
(Penn). Dr. Chirinos‘ long-term goals are to: (1) Substantially contribute to our understanding and approaches to
the prevention and treatment of aortic aging and its associated disease burden, and; (2) to mentor the next
generation of investigators interested in the epidemiology of aortic aging and its consequences in human health.
This mid-career development award will be critical to help him achieve these goals via dedicated/protected time
for mentoring activities, research and development of new skills that are anticipated to greatly enhance the
applicant’s impact in this field throughout the rest of his career, as well as the impact and success of his trainees.
The candidate has a strong record of mentorship, leadership, and research productivity. His research program
encompasses epidemiologic, translational and POR studies of arterial aging and its role in Heart Failure with
Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) and other conditions that afflict our aging population. The scientific goal of

This proposal outlines a comprehensive five-year mentored career development plan with the goal of preparing
the candidate, Sandeep Wontakal, M.D., Ph.D., for an independent academic research career as a physician-
scientist. The training plan is designed to acquire and refine skills in three critical aspects essential for a
successful career as a physician-scientist: 1) establishing the basis for an independent research program 2)
expanding clinical expertise and 3) enhancing mentorship/leadership skills. His strong background in functional
genomics from his graduate work and his experience as a board-certified molecular pathologist with expertise in
genomic testing of rare disorders, provides a solid foundation upon which the training plan builds. Dr. Wontakal’s
long-term research and clinical interest is to decode the information transmitted in the non-coding genome and
how mutations in these regions can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders. The scientific aspects of the proposal
will be mentored by Dr. Oliver Hobert, Professor and HHMI Investigator, who is a leading neuroscientist with a
long track record of mentoring successful trainees. Dr. Wontakal will develop further clinical acumen in identifying
pathogenic non-coding mutations under the guidance of the preeminent human geneticist, Dr. David Goldstein,
Director of the Institute for Genomic Medicine at Columbia University. An advisory panel of renowned physician-
scientists and an expert in RNA neurobiology will also oversee the candidate’s progress and provide guidance.
This work will be performed at Columbia University under the auspices of the Department of Biological Sciences,
one of the birthplaces of genetics, and the Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, which has a long history of
training physician-scientists. The vibrant scientific and clinical environment at Columbia with its world-renowned
neuroscience community, will serve as an ideal environment to successfully execute the proposed training plan.
Taking advantage of the powerful genetic and cell biological tools available in C. elegans, Dr. Wontakal will study
how the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), lep-5, functions in regulating the timing of neurodevelopment. Lep-5
expression is temporally regulated and preliminary results show lep-5 is required for proper sexual maturation of
the male nervous system. Dr. Wontakal has generated several novel strains to determine how the precise
spatiotemporal expression of lep-5 is established through studying the following three aims: 1) determine the cis
regulatory elements controlling lep-5 expression 2) determine how the transcription factor lin-14 represses lep-
5 expression 3) determine the transcriptional activator(s) of lep-5 expression. This project will enable Dr.
Wontakal to gain expertise in genetic analysis, microscopy-based analysis, neurodevelopment, and non-coding
RNAs. Importantly, the proposed project has the potential to serve as the foundation for starting his own
independent research group. Clinically oriented training in neurogenetics, bioinformatics, and statistical genetics
coupled with formal mentorship and leadership training will place Dr. Wontakal on a path to become a leader in

10767291,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE 4) allele is the most important genetic risk factor for late onset
Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent review by the World Health Organization highlighted the potential
protective role of physical activity and exercise against cognitive decline, all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular
dementia in healthy individuals. In an 18-month longitudinal observational study, we showed that sedentary 4
carriers experience significant declines in episodic memory and hippocampal volume compared to 4 carriers
who engaged in moderate PA. Importantly, among 4 non-carriers, no significant longitudinal changes in
cognition and brain imaging were observed whether the non-carriers were sedentary or engaged in moderate
PA, suggesting that PA has a specific neuroprotective role in delaying the progression of AD in 4 carriers.
Based on our results, a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial with blinded clinical and imaging outcomes is
proposed to determine the impact of a home based, high intensity exercise intervention in healthy, cognitively
intact 4 carriers between the ages of 65 and 80 years. The CYCLE-AD (CYcling to Cease or Limit the Effects
of Alzheimer's Disease) trial will recruit otherwise healthy sedentary carriers randomized to one of two groups
(n=75 each): 1) an Indoor Cycling (IC) group that participates in high-intensity interval training (HIIT; 60-90% of
heart rate reserve) in their home via the commercially available Peloton® cycling system or 2) a Usual and
Customary Care (UCC) group, in which participants engage in their habitual level of PA. We hypothesize that
an 18-month high-intensity aerobic exercise regimen will slow AD-related disease progression in sedentary
elders at genetic risk for AD. Participants in the intervention group will engage in exercise 3x/week (minimum
90 minutes/week) for 18 months. Primary outcome measures, obtained at study entry and at 18 months, will
include comprehensive cognitive testing and brain MR imaging to assess disease progression and a
comprehensive PA/fitness assessment to measure the degree of change in physical fitness due to high
intensity aerobic exercise. The overall goal of the CYCLE-AD trial is to determine the role of long-term,
high intensity exercise in slowing or delaying the onset of cognitive and AD-related brain changes in 4
carriers. Successful translation and demonstration of the effectiveness of a scalable home-based exercise
intervention capable of slowing or delaying disease onset will transform AD treatment, improve patient
outcomes and quality of life, and reduce health care costs."
10754247,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The American Cancer
Society (ACS) recommends normal body mass index (BMI), regular physical activity, and a healthy diet for
cancer survivors. In 2018, we estimated that 38% of deaths within 5 years of diagnosis could be prevented in
stage III colon cancer if all patients followed the ACS guidelines. Yet, <10% of CRC patients closely follow
these lifestyle guidelines. Investigators have yet to optimize a lifestyle intervention, capitalizing on effective
scalable components, to improve lifestyle behaviors in CRC survivors. Critical research gaps include: 1)
whether specific intervention components (e.g., text messaging, etc.) are effective, overall or in sub-groups
(men vs. women, etc.); 2) insufficient focus on improving diet; and 3) few studies with remote interventions
have measured biological outcomes. To address these gaps, we propose to use the multiphase optimization
strategy (MOST) framework to identify effective intervention components to increase the ACS guideline score
(a standardized measure of physical activity, diet, and body size) among CRC survivors. The MOST framework
is an engineering-based approach to efficiently optimize behavioral interventions while managing limited
resources. Our team at the University of California, San Francisco; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; and
Northwestern University have strong expertise conducting lifestyle interventions in cancer survivors, including
using MOST. Building on this experience, we propose a 12-month (mo.) randomized factorial experiment
among 400 CRC survivors to determine the effect of 4 candidate intervention components [text messaging,
digital health tool kit (physical activity tracker, apps), health coaching, buddy training (e.g., friend, family)] on
change in the ACS guideline score from 0 to 12 mo. Changes in the ACS score (our primary outcome) have
high potential to impact CRC survival, and it is modifiable and measurable remotely. Our Specific Aims are to:
Aim 1) Identify which of 4 candidate intervention components increase the ACS guideline score at 12 mo.
among CRC survivors. We will determine the individual and interaction effects of each component.
Secondarily, we aim to: Aim 2) Examine mediators and moderators of the intervention components’ effects on
change in the ACS guideline score from 0 to 12 mo. We will examine social cognitive theory constructs as
primary target mediators and sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological/behavioral factors as potential
moderators. This aim will help us understand how and for whom the intervention components affect lifestyle
behaviors. Aim 3) Examine the ACS guideline score in relation to levels of fasting insulin, glucose, HOMA-IR
and inflammatory markers at enrollment and 12 mo. The data from all three aims of this proposal will guide our
next step to conduct a definitive randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of the optimized intervention
versus standard care on risk of CRC recurrence. Overall, this proposal is a critical step toward developing an
effective and scalable lifestyle intervention to reduce CRC mortality with potential for high public health impact."
10764792,"Project Summary/Abstract
Respiratory failure commonly occurs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and leads to significant morbidity
and mortality. The onset of respiratory weakness heralds an increased risk of aspiration related to bulbar
muscle weakness and ineffective cough, hypercapnic respiratory failure due to chronic hypoventilation, and
pulmonary infections, ultimately leading to death. Despite the key role of respiratory failure in the morbidity and
mortality associated with ALS, there remains uncertainty concerning optimum initiation and maintenance of
respiratory care for this disease. ALS has a very heterogeneous clinical presentation and symptom
progression, which causes variable evolution of respiratory involvement. Given the significance of respiratory
morbidity with this disease combined with the unclear timing, identifying high-risk subgroups may facilitate
studying outcomes of early respiratory interventions. Our group has published a clinical prediction tool which
can predict a high risk of respiratory failure within six months in ALS. We have also published a latent class
analysis to identify subphenotypes of ALS patients by their differing trajectories of forced vital capacity over
time. Applying our clinical prediction tool and knowledge of phenotypes to a sample of ALS patients would
identify a subgroup suitable for future clinical trials. However, given the emotional burden of ALS, patient
perspectives on respiratory interventions are critical to successful implementation. To our knowledge, a
prospective investigation on a cohort of ALS patients at high risk of respiratory failure has yet to be performed.
The goals of this study are to use our clinical prediction tool to identify the prevalence of newly-diagnosed ALS
patients at high risk of respiratory failure, to elucidate patient perspectives on early respiratory care, and to
implement a pilot trial of lung volume recruitment in high-risk patients. This proposal will involve a multicenter
study at three academic centers in Philadelphia. We will perform a prospective cohort study of patients with
ALS, apply our clinical prediction tool, and monitor them for respiratory failure over one year. We will use semi-
structured interviews to gather patient perspectives regarding circumstances under which they would accept
early respiratory care in ALS. Third, we will perform a single-arm pilot intervention of lung volume recruitment
in newly-diagnosed ALS patients at high risk of respiratory failure within six months.
This project will provide essential preliminary data for a Research Project Grant application that will (1) conduct
a randomized controlled trial of early respiratory therapy in high-risk ALS patients (2) elucidate physician and
caregiver perspectives regarding respiratory care in ALS, and (3) identify which characteristics are associated
with different trajectories of respiratory function, thus allowing for personalized medicine."
10815853,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. KRAS is a major
oncogenic driver of this disease and found in ~ 30% of all NSCLCs. Unfortunately, efforts to develop drugs that
target mutant KRAS proteins have largely been unsuccessful, since both single agent inhibition of effector
pathways downstream of KRAS or combinations have proven to be ineffective. Thus, developing novel
therapies for KRAS-driven NSCLC remains an area with a critical unmet need. The overarching goal of this
proposal is to dissect the mechanistic underpinning of how genetic ablation of CRAF induces regression of
KRAS-driven NSCLC. We have generated a KRAS-driven, human NSCLC cell line with inducible CRAF
expression that undergoes apoptosis upon CRAF knockdown. This proposal utilizes this system, along with
biochemical and immunological techniques, to 1) identify the domain(s) of CRAF responsible for mediating
tumor regression, 2) determine the downstream effectors necessary for tumor regression, and 3) characterize
the changes within the tumor microenvironment upon CRAF loss. Improved mechanistic understanding of this
phenomenon and successful execution of these aims will lead to novel strategies for targeting KRAS-driven
lung cancers, either as monotherapy or rationally-designed combination therapy, as well as potential
biomarkers predictive of response. Dr. Victoria Wang is mentored by Dr. Frank McCormick, a world expert in
RAS signaling, and will also benefit from an advisory committee comprised of Dr. Dean Sheppard, Dr. David
Carbone, Dr. Matthew Krummel, and Dr. Shiva Malek, who will collectively provide mentorship, collaboration
and expertise in cancer biology, signaling, immunology, and lung cancer translational research. Dr. Wang has
also formulated a comprehensive 5-year training plan that will leverage the outstanding resources available at
UCSF (ranking second in NIH funding among all institutions), incorporating laboratory training, didactic
coursework, scientific meetings and professional development opportunities that will assist her in achieving her
scientific and career goals of developing into an independent, translational lung cancer investigator."

Kidney disorders comprising acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) account for significant morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD). AKI, a potent risk
factor for CKD and ESRD, develops primarily in SCD patients hospitalized with vasoocclusive pain crisis (VOC)
or acute chest syndrome (ACS). These characteristic SCD events are associated with rapid drop in hemoglobin
implying acute intravascular hemolysis releasing free circulating heme as a potential trigger for AKI. However,
the precise mechanisms of this association have not been investigated per se, and therefore targeted therapies
based on mechanistic models have not emerged for kidney injuries in SCD. Excess circulating heme is primarily
scavenged by hemopexin (Hx) and delivered to liver for degradation by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Due to
chronic hemolysis, Hx is depleted in SCD. We reasoned that during acute intravascular hemolysis in SCD,
excess extracellular heme will preferentially bind to alpha-1-microglobulin (A1M), a secondary plasma heme
scavenger, which carries free heme to the kidneys. Consequently, renal proximal tubular epithelial cells
(RPTECs) will be exposed to high amount of toxic heme. Induction of intracellular HO-1 normally protects
RPTECs from heme toxicity and averts AKI. We have recently discovered that both patients and mice with SCD
have elevated plasma A1M compare to normal controls. This discovery leads to the development of a clinically
relevant model of AKI in humanized sickle mice by modest elevation of circulating heme through intravenous
injection of purified heme (hemin). Pilot data suggests that SCD patients with higher A1M/Hx ratio posses the
risk of developing AKI following VOC. Heme suppresses hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4a) expression
associated with reduced hemopexin expression in liver following acute hemolysis. Preliminary data also showed
that persistent exposure to excess heme renders RPTECs refractory to HO-1 induction during acute hemolysis
in SCD. Moreover, we found that heme induces kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) associated with amplification of
mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) that triggers renal tubular epithelial cell death. Based on these data we
hypothesized that enhanced clearance of circulating heme to the kidneys and impaired induction of HO-1 in the
renal tubular epithelium during intravascular hemolysis in SCD trigger tubular cell death and AKI development.
We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims that integrate experiments with cultured and primary human
RPTECs, murine models and clinical biorepository samples including serum, plasma and urine from multiple
cohorts of SCD patients.
Aim 1 will determine whether altered concentration of circulating heme scavenger proteins, can serve as risk
factor for AKI in individuals with SCD. This aim will also determine if multiple hemolytic events develop CKD.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that heme regulates the biosynthesis of Hx by down-regulating the expression of
HNF4a.
Aim 3 will utilize human RPTECs and specific gene knockout mouse strains to determine if heme induced KLF9
amplification accelerates cell death that involves overproduction of mtROS. This aim will use targeted HO-1
knockout or overexpression mice to determine whether amplified KLF9 blocks sufficient HO-1 induction and
promotes heme induced AKI in SCD.
This study will delineate the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of excess circulating heme mediated AKI in
SCD during intravascular hemolysis, and identify potential therapeutic targets. This project will also elucidate a
novel mechanism of heme-induced KLF9 mediated renal tubular epithelial cell death. Most importantly, rigorous
analysis of clinical samples collected at baseline, during hospitalizations or following AKI incidences will establish
whether A1M and Hx can serve as risk factors for AKI in SCD patients."

The goal of this international collaborative project, in response to PAR-20-027, is to characterize the genetic
architecture of schizophrenia in the Xhosa population of South Africa. The three participating sites have
already successfully established the infrastructure necessary to undertake the aims of this proposal: University
of Washington, Seattle (Mary-Claire King, Jack McClellan, Tom Walsh, MPIs); Columbia University, New York
(Ezra Susser, PI); and University of Cape Town, South Africa (Dan Stein, PI).
African populations harbor far more genetic variation than out-of-Africa populations, facilitating discovery of
associations between genotypes and phenotypes. Our initial study (Gulsuner at al., Science, 2020) was the
first large-scale genetic study of schizophrenia in an ancestral African population. We discovered that Xhosa
individuals with schizophrenia (cases) are enriched for rare damaging mutations in genes intolerant to such
mutations. The effect was particularly strong for damaging mutations in genes involved in synaptic functioning.
These results extend understanding of schizophrenia genetics, specifically supporting an oligogenic, severe
alleles model and a role for rare damaging mutations in genes critical to synaptic signaling and plasticity.
For this project, we propose to enroll an additional 1250 cases and 1250 age- and gender-matched controls, all
Xhosa-speaking, bringing our total study population to 5425 participants. We will apply new genomic
technology to identify previously undetectable classes of mutations likely to be implicated in schizophrenia. The
genomic structure of Xhosa cases and controls will be characterized using whole genome sequencing (wgs),
both short–read Illumina wgs to identify conventional classes of mutations and long-read PacBio wgs to identify
structural variants of all types, mobile transposable elements, and repeat expansions. In addition, SAX v2, the
African-variation-enriched SNP array developed for this project by Affymetrix, will be used to identify copy
number variants (CNVs).
Africa is the single most informative continent for understanding the human genome and human disorders with
worldwide impact. African populations provide the most complete human reference genomes for screening
candidate risk alleles for any phenotype. The whole-genome sequencing strategies used in this project allow
the comparison of all classes of damaging mutations between cases and controls, including the detection of
case-specific copy number variation and repeat expansions, while also providing a resource for human
genomics research worldwide."

Understanding and targeting abnormal tumor microenvironment is critically important for developing effective
therapy. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a form of myeloproliferavtie neoplasm (MPN) that often progresses to
lethal leukemia. Treatment options are limited for PMF, and the only potential cure, stem cell transplantation, is
prohibitively toxic for most patients. Thus, novel and effective therapies are in great need for PMF. Recurrent
mutations resulting in abnormal activation of the JAK-STAT pathway have been shown to be the driver of the
disease. As a result, JAK inhibitors have been developed to treat PMF. However, these inhibitors only reduce
some constitutional symptoms without significant impact on disease-causing leukemia stem cells (LSCs). A
deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of PMF will offer the opportunity to better treat the disease. The
bone marrow niche is a critical component to the pathogenesis of PMF. Our preliminary data show that bone
marrow LepR+ stromal cells are the source of fibrosis. We have also identified several key mediators of LepR+
cell fibrosis. In this proposal, we propose to elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of how LSCs
interact with the fibrotic niche in vivo. We will test whether targeting the fibrosis mediators will lead to efficient
elimination of LSCs and have synergistic effects with JAK inhibitors. By having a deeper understanding of the
interaction between LSCs and the niche, our strategy of targeting the diseased niche may provide novel
therapeutics to PMF."
10746827,"Project Summary
This R35 application proposes to capitalize on previous work produced by the PI over the past 11 years and to
further serve as a strong foundation for interrogating the role of sterile cardiac inflammation (inflammasomes)
in promoting the progression of heart failure caused by chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and complicated
with myocardial ischemia. The overarching goal of this program is to better understand how inflammasome
formation/activation in the heart secondary to different stress signals perpetuates myocardial injury and also
dissect the contributions of different cardiac cell types during this pathophysiologic process. 1) Previous
studies from the PI’s lab have characterized the role of the inflammasome in mediating adverse cardiac
remodeling following acute myocardial infarction in preclinical models. 2) Other studies from the PI’s lab also
demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition reduced interstitial fibrosis and preserved systolic cardiac
function in mice exposed to doxorubicin. Evidence from the literature also supports a pathophysiologic role of
NLRP3 in mediating doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Moreover, studies from the PI’s lab and others have
shown that endogenous production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is essential for survival during cellular stresses,
including ischemia, and that administration of H2S donors further promotes survival. The orally-active H2S-
donor SG1002 was shown in a recent Phase I clinical trial to be safe and tolerable in heart failure patients and
also to increase blood H2S levels as well as circulating nitric oxide while attenuating BNP. We recently
demonstrated that H2S treatment attenuates ischemic and inflammatory (NLRP3 inflammasome) injury
following myocardial infarction. Accordingly, modulation of the inflammasome with H2S may represent an
important mechanism to limit inflammatory cell death and mitigate cardiomyopathy. Preliminary data
demonstrate that increases in cofilin-2 expression and its potential for phospohorylation and oxidation under
oxidative stress rises during ischemic injury, which is attenuated with H2S donors. Thus, this proposal provides
the opportunity to perform in-depth investigations on role of the cardiac inflammasome and structural proteins,
such as cofilin2, in heart failure due to chemotoxicity and also when complicated with myocardial infarction,
therefore extending our knowledge on the potential mechanism of cardiotoxicity and facilitating the design and
development of novel preventive/therapeutic modalities in the emerging field of cardio-oncology."

Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), neurocognitive complications continue to be highly prevalent in people
living with HIV (PLWH). One explanation could be the constant compromise of the blood brain barrier (BBB)
driven by chronic inflammatory responses. The introduction of medicinal marijuana into HIV treatment practice
appear to be beneficial for several virus associated complications (ranging from chronic pain to appetite
stimulation). Yet, the effects and mechanisms of cannabis on HIV associated chronic inflammation, the
endocannabinoid system, immune modulation and neurologic disorders are minimally understood. As indicated
in the RFA, preclinical models can provide a rigorous in-depth analysis of the molecular and cellular
mechanisms at the intersection between phytocannabinoids, HIV and ART. To this end, we propose a
comprehensive evaluation of the two most used cannabinoid compounds (THC, CBD) on BBB function,
immune-endothelial interactions and neuroinflammation. We will utilize state of the art chip microfluidics
models of the neurovascular unit (NVU) and animal models for HIV (w/ w/o ART). Previously, we discovered
that the brain endothelium upregulate CB2 in HIV infected human brain tissue. We have also found that
modulation of CB2 affects indices of HIV pathology (in-vivo) and regulates the BBB. Our preliminary studies
identify the diverse effects that phytocannabinoids can have on the different properties of the BBB. Specifically,
cannabinoids (THC, CBD) alone can enhance the physical barrier, partially reduce endothelial activation and
augment efflux transporter activity. Although some of these effects may appear beneficial, the presence of HIV
and ART changes how the function of the BBB is regulated by cannabinoid substances. For example, the
augmented transporter activity by THC has important considerations for altering ART-CNS penetrability. Thus,
we hypothesize that phytocannabinoids differentially modulates BBB function that are both beneficial
and deleterious in NeuroHIV. In Aim 1, using our latest tissue-engineered microfluidic NVU model, we will
perform analyses of the kinetic changes in BBB permeability, transporter status and immune-endothelial
interaction. Then, in Aim 2, we will compare outcomes between widely used routes of cannabinoid
administration (oral vs. inhaled) in vivo using two relevant models of HIV infection (‘humanized’ mice and a
model of aseptic meningitis/encephalitis). Experiments will evaluate changes in the BBB in the context of ART
and cannabinoid exposure. Finally, we propose to identify novel crosstalk mechanisms that bridge cannabinoid
receptor signaling to signals that control BBB maintenance (Aim 3). It’s clear that cannabinoids exert unknown
cell specific effects that contribute to the tumultuous interpretation of how these compounds impact NeuroHIV.
Using innovative preclinical tools, our studies will contribute significantly towards understanding the
consequences of cannabinoid use on the BBB in the modern era of NeuroHIV."

The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences
schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community
partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and
translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New
York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%)
parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years.
A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform
innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation.
We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health
disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has
catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable
growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into
a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region,
opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the
Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in
2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a
new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational
research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even
further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting
and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational
research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health
informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative
translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium;
2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special
populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes
focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical
informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform
research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand
translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively
contribute to the national consortium.

South Africa has the world’s largest antiretroviral therapy treatment program and the second highest TB
incidence, with TB the leading cause of death from an infectious agent. South Africa is amongst the top 10
countries with high burden of HIV, TB and drug-resistant TB. The Stellenbosch University Clinical Trials Unit
(SUN-CTU) in Cape Town, South Africa is an established, pluripotent, high-capacity research partnership
between three Clinical Research Sites (CRSs): the Family Centre for Research with Ubuntu (FAMCRU), the
Desmond Tutu TB Centre (DTTC) and TASK Foundation NPC (TASK), ideally aligned for participation in
IMPAACT, ACTG, HPTN and expansion to HVTN network studies.
The overall SUN-CTU objective is to collaboratively design and implement high-impact clinical research that will
result in safe, patient- and-family-centered, effective prevention, treatment and remission of HIV and its related
comorbidities, and TB prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, across all age groups.
The SUN-CTU aims to address HIV therapeutic research priorities across all ages: FAMCRU will prioritize
pharmacokinetics and safety of new antiretrovirals and other interventions across all ages, to minimize long -
term treatment complications, antiretroviral resistance, TB/HIV drug-drug interactions, and promote treatment
adherence. We will focus on early treated children and adolescents for HIV remission and neurodevelopment
and adult Hepatitis, CMV co-infection and non-communicable diseases, HIV-related neurocognitive
impairment, mental health and HIV persistence. Second, we will address HIV prevention research priorities in
high-risk populations across all ages: Through HPTN, the DTTC will design and implement HIV prevention
studies and evaluate long-acting antiretrovirals, multipurpose prevention technologies, broadly neutralizing
antibodies (bnAbs), and pre-exposure prophylaxis in adolescents and adults populations. FAMCRU will
implement HIV prevention studies in infants, HIV-exposed uninfected children and adolescents, with the full
range of interventions including prevention of mother to child transmission, bnAbs and HIV vaccines, through
IMPAACT. TASK will conduct HIV vaccine trials. Finally, we will address TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment
with/without HIV, across all ages: the SUN-CTU is ideally positioned to evaluate novel and repurposed TB
regimens for treatment and prevention across the disease spectrum in adults, with and without drug resistance
and HIV. New TB focus areas include adult TB vaccines, extrapulmonary TB, post-TB lung disease, and PK
studies in special populations including hospitalized critically ill patients e.g. TB meningitis. DTTC will lead
protocols to evaluate novel and repurposed drug regimens to treat and prevent drug-susceptible and drug-
resistant TB in infants, children, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women with TB without HIV including
specialized site of disease PK studies."

While digital marketing of tobacco products is becoming increasingly common, the role of social media platforms
in tobacco control is still understudied. There is a growing body of research suggesting that social media
promotion of cigar products is rapidly increasing.1-3 With regulation lagging behind innovative digital marketing
tactics, social networking sites have become an important promotional vehicle for tobacco brands. Commercial
social media messages often target youth and populations traditionally experiencing tobacco-related disparities.4,
5 Thus, disparities in the use of cigar and cigarillo products are persistent in the U.S., with nearly one in ten
African American high school students being cigar smokers in 2018.6, 7 Youth, African Americans, and Latinos
also use social media at higher rates than the general population, which potentially multiplies the effect of social
media marketing and contributes to disparities in tobacco marketing exposure. Understanding the impact of
exposure to messages about cigar, little cigar and cigarillo products on social media can offer meaningful insights
for tobacco control as social media data provide valuable measures of population norms, targeted marketing,
and other previously unmeasured contextual factors associated with health outcomes. Unfortunately, to date, no
studies have examined the population level impact of social media marketing of cigar and cigarillo products. This
project will advance the scientific knowledge on cigar products by filling this critical research gap. The
overarching goal of this project is to examine the direct effects and the unintended consequences of exposure
to social media content related to cigars, little cigars, and cigarillos and provide timely scientific basis for
regulatory actions on restricting marketing for cigar products, including little cigars and cigarillos (LCCs). The
specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to examine the impact of exposure to little cigar and cigarillo social
media content on LCC use, attitudes towards LCCs, harm perceptions, perceived prevalence of use, initiation,
and intentions to use LCCs; 2) to assess the unintended consequences of LCC-related content exposure on
social media, examining its impact on attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors related to other combustible products
such as cigarettes and hookah; as well as the impact of exposure on marijuana use and initiation; 3) to study
whether or to what extent state and local tobacco control policies and marijuana regulations modify the direct
effects and unintended impact of potential exposure to social media content. These aims will be accomplished
by applying innovative research and analytic methods to a unique combination of data sets, including social
media data from Twitter and Instagram, Nielsen store scanner data on LCC and other tobacco product sales,
and survey data on tobacco-related outcomes. The findings from this project will provide highly policy-relevant
scientific evidence on the population level impact of social media marketing of LCC products. This project will
provide unique insight into the direct effects and unintended influences of digital cigar promotion and build a
scientific and methodological base for surveillance and regulation of social media marketing."

Metabolic depression (MD) occurs during the acute period of TBI and this impairs the ability of neuronal circuits
to meet local activity demand, which in turn could limit the success of rehabilitative strategies, and functional
outcome. Although most neurons survive mild or moderate TBI, at least acutely, they cannot operate efficiently
and this severely compromises brain function, which may lead to persistent behavioral deficits. This manifests
as a loss of correlated functional activity using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsFMRI)
and is typically reported using a connectomic analysis of brain network function. There remains much to learn
about how to treat the injured brain, how the functional trajectory of neurons evolves with time, and the
dependence on the extent and major pathologic subtype of the initial injury. We propose combined rsFMRI,
behavior and molecular studies of metabolism and synaptic plasticity that will provide a longitudinal analysis of
injury to investigate how MD manifests in altered functional connectivity and brain reorganization chronically. We
will use the information gained to provide insight on how the small molecule agonist of TrkB receptors - 7,8-
dihydroxyflavone (DHF) will alter the functional trajectory of the injured brain through reduction of MD acutely,
followed by enhancement of synaptic plasticity and cognitive outcome chronically. By modelling clinical situations
of early post-injury rehabilitation versus rehabilitation that is delayed due to additional injuries, we will determine
whether an intervention with DHF will mitigate the effects of acute MD, followed by, or simultaneously with the
reinstitution of function using a period of early or delayed exercise. We propose studies that will test whether
either intervention, alone or in combination, can be delayed but still provide a significant boost to brain
connectivity and functional outcome. We will conduct these studies in both male and female rats, and will use
new statistically-driven methods that provide a level of confidence to enable subject-level analysis for
discrimination of burden of tissue damage, regardless of the actual injury severity. We will employ these
covariates of MD, tissue swelling and atrophy, as well as exercise level, to derive a statistically robust analysis
of whether off-setting MD acutely, will potentiate the effects of rehabilitation."

Our U01 project supports NIAID’s mission to better understand, treat, and prevent infectious diseases by
focusing on pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine development. Vaccines that efficiently stop the Plasmodium
sporozoite (spz) or liver stage can provide complete protection against malarial disease and will enable
eradication efforts. There are currently no FDA-approved malaria vaccines for use in humans although
repeated dosing with intravenously-administered attenuated spz has shown sterile protection against challenge
in multiple Phase 1-2 clinical trials. Recently, CD8+ T cells that reside in the liver, namely liver resident memory
T cells or TRM cells, have been identified as key cell types in protection against liver stage infection. Vaccine
strategies that increase liver TRM cells and can be readily adapted to clinical use are therefore critically needed.
Such vaccines could bolster CD8+ T cell immunity and may result in T cell-focused vaccines that achieve
durable, high-grade protection for persons in endemic and non-endemic regions. Our laboratory has developed
a two-dose vaccine that uses a DNA prime followed by an attenuated spz boost or ‘trapping dose’ that
increases liver TRM cells and achieves sterile protection. This project aims to improve upon spz-based trapping
by developing an orally-administered nanoparticle-based trapping vaccine. The University of Washington will
collaborate with Johns Hopkins University to develop this more easily manufactured, more easily deliverable,
and less expensive vaccine. In Project 1, we will define a threshold of Pf antigen-specific TRM cells needed to
achieve protection using DNA prime/sporozoite trapping. In Project 2, we will optimize nanoparticles for liver-
specific delivery and expression profile in hepatocytes using a variety of nanoparticle compositions, sizes,
surface characteristics, and formulation strategies. In Project 3, we will evaluate the optimized nanoparticles in
prime-and-trap vaccination in mice and non-human primates for safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and
efficacy. If successful, this project will deliver an optimized prime-and-oral trap vaccine rationally designed to
elicit complete protection against the Plasmodium liver stage."

Dendrite structure: Data-Driven Models to Bridge from Molecules to Morphology
The highly branched structures of dendritic arbors enable the extraordinary connectivity and
information-processing power of the nervous system. Altered dendritic morphologies are often
associated with neurological conditions and diseases. While we know many molecular
components underlying dendritic growth and structure through genetic and cell biological studies,
we still do not understand how molecular interactions generate dendritic arbors, which are
thousands to millions of times larger than the constituent molecules.
 The overall goal of this application is to develop data-driven models that predict,
quantitatively, dendritic growth in Drosophila Class IV da neurons. These cells are chosen
because their dendrites can be imaged with outstanding spatial and temporal resolution, and the
genetic tools in flies facilitate molecular manipulations. Our central hypothesis is that the growing
and shrinking tips of dendrites constitute an intermediate level of organization between molecules
and morphology. This allows us to divide the large gap between genotype and phenotype into
two parts: the first is from molecules to dendrite tips, and the second is from dendrite tips to
morphology. The second part will be bridged using models.
 To attain our overall objective, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (i) We will
formulate kinetic rules underlying the dynamics of dendritic tips using high-resolution, live-cell
imaging to measure the birth and death of tips through branching and retraction, and the transition
rates between different velocity states. (ii) We will develop multi-scale mathematical models that
take as input the data such as obtained in Aim 1 and predict morphologies, which will be compared
to real dendritic arbors. (iii) We will genetically perturb cytoskeletal proteins and use the models
to test whether the effects on tip dynamics account for the altered dendrite structures. The
expected outcome is mechanistic understanding of how morphological phenotypes emerge from
molecular processes occurring at the level of dendrite tips. These results will positively impact the
field by bridging genotype to phenotype and by providing insight into the pathophysiology of
genetic disorders that affect neuronal structures."

Although secreted molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (eHSP90) has been implicated in tumor cell
invasion through binding and stabilizing extracellular matrix protease client MMP2, our limited understanding of
the regulatory mechanisms that control the eHSP90 chaperone system is a major drawback for designing
successful HSP90-targeted therapies. Our long-term goal is to develop therapeutic strategies that prevent
tumor cell invasion by targeting the extracellular HSP90 chaperone machinery. Our overall objective is to
elucidate how eHSP90 and its regulators are mechanistically modulated, individually and collectively, and in
the presence of their extracellular inhibitors. Our central hypothesis is that extracellular ATP, and tyrosine
phosphorylation of eHSP90 co-chaperone TIMP2, modulate the chaperoning of client MMP2, and affect
HSP90 binding to extracellular inhibitors. This hypothesis is based on our recent published work and
preliminary studies showing that eHSP90 binds and hydrolyzes ATP, and that co-chaperone TIMP2 enhances
HSP90 binding to ATP and its pharmacologic inhibitors. Our rationale is that by elucidating mechanisms of
eHSP90 chaperone regulation, we will design better therapies for diseases that implicate the eHSP90
machinery. We plan to test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) Investigate
the role of ATPase activity in the regulation of extracellular HSP90 (eHSP90); 2) Determine the impact of
tyrosine phosphorylation of TIMP2 on its co-chaperone function; and 3) Elucidate the role of TIMP2 in
enhancing eHSP90 binding to extracellular inhibitors. Under the first aim, approaches to be used are already
established in PI's laboratory and include purification of intracellular and extracellular HSP90 from human cell
cultures, isothermal calorimetry to determine affinity towards an ATP analog, ATPase assays to measure
ATPase activity, enzyme kinetics to determine proteolytic activity, and in vitro and in vivo protein-protein
interactions in the presence and following depletion of extracellular ATP in genetic knock out cell cultures.
Under the second aim, phosphomimetic or non-phosphorylatable TIMP2 mutants designed in the PI's
laboratory will be used, CRISPR knock out cell lines for c-Src kinase, TIMP2 and MMP2 will be employed for
protein-protein interactions and to determine impact on MMP2 activity. Under the third aim, the role of TIMP2,
non-phosphorylatable and phophomimetic mutants in enhanced binding of eHSP90 to its extracellular
inhibitors will be evaluated in drug binding assays performed in vitro and extracellularly in vivo, using human
cell lines and siRNA technology. The impact of TIMP2, and eHSP90 inhibitors on MMP2 mediated proteolysis
will be evaluated in matrix degradation studies. The research approach is innovative, in the PI's opinion,
because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by shifting focus towards targeting
chaperone-regulated extracellular pathways. The proposed research is significant because, it is expected to
provide insight on the basic extracellular regulatory elements that support mechanisms of tumor cell invasion."

 Animals depend on their temperature-sensing systems to avoid noxious thermal extremes and to seek
optimal temperatures for survival. Temperature sensation is particularly relevant for small animals, such as
insects, which rely on ambient temperatures to set their body temperatures. Many insect vectors of diseases,
such as mosquitoes, respond to the temperature of their warm-blooded hosts and use it to guide the blood-
feeding behaviors through which they transmit human diseases. Thus, it is important to identify the temperature-
sensing molecules and neurons to help control disease vectors. Fruit flies are a suitable model system for these
studies, because of their evolutionarily conserved temperature-sensing molecules with mosquito. In flies, many
temperature-sensing systems possess a small number of temperature sensory neurons that master robust
behaviors. Moreover, the powerful genetics developed in flies ensures the precise manipulation of temperature-
sensing molecules and neurons. Preliminary studies from the PI’s lab discovered a set of previously unidentified
warm-activated neurons in fly larvae, whose temperature-sensing molecules and functions are unknown.
Preliminary data suggested that these neurons depended on a new class of warm-sensing molecules to detect
warm temperatures. Besides a classic function of temperature-responsive neurons that determine temperature
preference, these neurons may have an additional function to modulate their neighboring cool-activated neurons.
Such modulation may result in change of physiological properties in neighboring neurons. The goal of this
application is to identify the warm-sensing molecules in these warm-activated neurons, to demonstrate their
functions in temperature preference, and to determine their modulatory effects on neighboring neurons. In
addition to having preliminary data, we are particularly well-prepared to undertake the proposed research
because of our extensive, and successful, track record of studying temperature-responsive molecules and
sensory neurons in flies. Since the potential candidates of the warm-sensing molecules are conserved between
flies and mosquitoes, this study might provide novel targets to control blood-feeding behaviors of mosquitoes
and other disease vectors."
10739814,"Apolipoprotein (apo)A-II is an abundant human plasma protein primarily in high-density
lipoproteins (HDL) but also in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons. Despite
a large literature, its physiological functions remain ambiguous and widely debated. For
example, it has been postulated to play both beneficial and detrimental roles in cardiovascular
disease (CVD) development. We believe that apoA-II functions quite differently than other
apolipoproteins, which tend to act directly as a co-factor or ligand. We hypothesize that apoA-
II impacts both HDL and VLDL metabolism indirectly by altering the lipoprotein proteome
and/or affecting the conformation and function of co-residing proteins. Our work shows that
apoA-II can stimulate HDL to promote cholesterol efflux from cells, but only when apoA-I is
present. This is important because HDL cholesterol efflux proficiency is a better predictor of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) than its plasma levels. We also found that apoA-II impacts the
VLDL proteome and suspect that this underlies delayed VLDL lipolysis and/or receptor
mediated clearance when apoA-II is elevated. Hypertriglyceridemia and delayed post-
prandial remnant clearance is an important CVD risk factor. We will define the mechanism for
apoA-II’s potentiation of HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux by testing its effects on apoA-I
structure using innovative structural techniques including cryo-electron microscopy. An
important goal will be to identify the apoA-II sequences responsible with an eye toward
developing cholesterol efflux boosting therapeutics. Using human proteins in human plasma-
based experiments, we will also determine how apoA-II affects the composition and structure
of other VLDL proteins and assess the consequences with respect to activation of lipoprotein
lipase and binding to cell surface receptors responsible for its plasma clearance. With a full
mechanistic understanding of these effects, it may be possible to derive apoA-II based
therapeutic approaches that minimize the protein’s deleterious effects while optimizing
benefits for CVD and possibly other metabolic diseases."
10709572,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder affecting about 1 million Americans. MS is typically
more aggressive in men than women, thus Veterans, being mostly men, often have more severe symptoms,
worse mobility, and more advanced disability compared to non-Veterans with MS. Among the many MS
symptoms, muscle weakness is among the most common, contributes to decreased mobility, and worsens as
disability advances. While there is strong evidence that moderate-to-high intensity resistance training improves
muscle strength in people with MS and low disability, there is little evidence evaluating resistance training in
people with advanced disability due to MS (i.e., those who need assistance to walk or use a wheelchair).
People with advanced disability due to MS require unique approaches to resistance training as they often
cannot tolerate higher intensity exercise because of severe weakness and fatigue. Blood flow restriction (BFR)
has the potential to address these issues. With BFR, resistance training at low intensities has been shown to
be as effective as high intensity training without BFR at increasing muscle strength and hypertrophy in people
with a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. Our team also has preliminary data to support the safety,
feasibility, and tolerance of BFR resistance training in people with advanced disability due to MS. The objective
of the currently proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of low-load resistance training with BFR on muscle
strength, mobility, and fatigue in people with advanced disability due to MS.
This proposed Phase II clinical trial would be the first to study the efficacy of low-load resistance training with
BFR in people with MS and would address a crucial gap that is highly relevant for Veterans with MS:
interventions to improve mobility and optimize function for those with advanced disability. Fifty-eight
participants with MS and advanced disability will be randomized (1:1) to low-load resistance training with BFR
(experimental) or without BFR (control). Resistance training will target knee and hip extension, knee and hip
flexion, and ankle plantarflexion 2x/week for 10 weeks. A blinded assessor will collect outcomes at baseline,
post-intervention (primary endpoint), and after 8 weeks of follow-up. The Study Aims are to determine
between-group differences in 1) Muscle health: quadriceps strength (primary outcome) and muscle
morphology (thickness and echogenicity); 2) Mobility: 30-Second Sit-to-Stand; and 3) Self-reported fatigue:
Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. We hypothesize that the experimental group will have significantly greater
improvements in muscle strength and thickness, mobility, and self-reported fatigue compared to the control
group. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinically feasible exercise interventions for people with
advanced disability due to MS that can improve participation, quality of life, and disability.
In addition to leading the research project, the candidate will leverage protected time to develop research,
technical, and leadership skills essential for a future role as a VA independent investigator with expertise in
developing, optimizing, and implementing interventions that improve participation, quality of life, and physical
health outcomes in people with MS and other populations with disability. During the training portion of this
award the candidate will develop expertise in 1) sonographic assessment of muscle morphology, 2) the use of
biomarker analysis to measure the impact of exercise in people with MS, and 3) science leadership. The
training and research will be supported by the personnel, resources, and infrastructure at the Geriatric
Research Education and Clinical Center of the VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System. Specifically, the
screening, outcome assessments, and intervention will take place in the Muscle Morphology, Mechanics, and
Performance Laboratory. Additional mentorship and support will be provided remotely from the VA Portland
Health Care System and the VA MS Centers of Excellence-West."
10758966,"Project Summary/Abstract
Microenvironmental determinants of primary and secondary brain tumor progression are incompletely
understood. Neuronal activity is emerging as a critical regulator of brain cancer behavior. We recently showed
that active glutamatergic neurons exert a mitogenic effect on high-grade glioma (HGG) through activity-
dependent secretion of growth factors - including neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) - which signals to glioma via activation
of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Activity-regulated release of NLGN3 promotes growth and is also required for glioma
progression, indicating its fundamental role in glioma pathophysiology and is incompletely explained by
stimulation of classical oncogenic signaling pathways alone. We previously demonstrated that neuroligin-3 also
induces glioma expression of numerous synaptic genes, raising the possibility that gliomas may engage in
synaptic communication. Here, we illustrate using electrophysiology and calcium imaging techniques that
neuron-glioma interactions include electrochemical communication through bona fide AMPA receptor-
dependent neuron-glioma synapses, resulting in excitatory post-synaptic currents and depolarization of glioma
cells. This glioma membrane depolarization assessed with in vivo optogenetics promotes glioma progression
similarly to the well-established effect in normal neural precursor cells. Concordantly, genetic or
pharmacological blockade of glutamatergic signaling inhibits glioma growth. Field recordings demonstrate
increased excitability in the glioma-infiltrated brain, emphasizing the positive feedback mechanisms by which
gliomas increase neuronal excitability and thereby activity-regulated glioma growth. Together, these findings
indicate that synaptic and electrical integration of glioma into glutamatergic neural circuitry promotes tumor
progression and elucidates the previously unexplored potential of targeting glioma circuit dynamics for cancer
therapy. This proposal aims to further clarify the complex mechanisms of activity-mediated brain tumor growth.
Using advanced systems-level neuroscience techniques, the proposed experiments will (1) clarify the role of
GABA-ergic signaling in regulating glioma growth through direct neuron-glioma signaling mechanisms and the
effect on overall neuronal excitability in the tumor microenvironment; (2) define the dynamic brain-wide circuit
mapping of different neuronal subpopulations contributing to glioma progression; (3) expand our understanding
of the influence of neuronal activity on non-glial derived secondary brain cancers, thus providing novel insight
into the mechanisms metastatic cancers utilize to seed and colonize the brain microenvironment. These studies
will develop a framework which maps crosstalk between neurons and brain cancers that may be used to elucidate
promising new therapeutic strategies. The experiments and training presented in this proposal will thus answer
fundamental questions in this emerging field of the neural regulation of cancers, while significantly aiding in my
career development and academic transition to independence."
10760301,"ABSTRACT:
Mucosal inflammatory responses involve the early accumulation of neutrophils (PMN). Without
efficient PMN clearance at sites of infiltration, PMN can accumulate and contribute to chronic
inflammatory conditions, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Within
these diseases, there is significant interest in defining components of the inflammatory
microenvironment as a window to understanding molecular mechanisms of progression or
resolution.
Our ongoing studies for this renewal application have revealed that PMN transepithelial
migration (TEM) results in significant extracellular acidosis, in part through generation of large
amounts of lactate. Moreover, we demonstrate that PMN-derived adenosine (Ado)
significantly promotes pH homeostasis within the mucosal microenvironment. Based on thes
new studies, we hypothesize that PMN-derived Ado signaling elicits an adaptive tissue
response by promoting pH homeostasis to inflammatory acidity.
Three specific aims are directed at testing this hypothesis: In Specific Aim 1, we will elucidate
the lactate release and signaling axis in intestinal epithelia. In Specific Aim 2, we will extend
preliminary data to determine the mechanism(s) of Ado-mediated pH homeostasis during
PMN TEM. Specific Aim 3 will utilize murine models to probe the role of pH homeostasis in
protection afforded by Ado in vivo. The overall aim of this proposal is to identify novel
metabolic signaling mediated by Ado within the mucosa during inflammatory acidosis.

Malaria caused by the Plasmodium parasite remains a global health threat, affecting ~200 million people and
leading to more than 400,000 deaths per year. Understanding the mechanisms contributing to pathological
inflammation during malaria can provide insight for the development of adjunctive therapies that can reduce
disease severity and mortality. In transmission settings where children suffer multiple malaria episodes per year,
blunting inflammation during early parasitemia can mitigate disease severity while adaptive immunity ramps up
to control parasite replication. Likewise, defining host processes that can reduce parasites during the liver stage,
when parasite burden is at its lowest, may lead to strategies to prevent infection. We have previously shown that
expression of p53 and p53 targets were increased in the blood of uninfected children who would later present
with asymptomatic P. falciparum parasitemia relative to children who later presented with febrile malaria.
Increasing p53 dampened the production of inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes stimulated with P.
falciparum, suggesting that p53 plays a role in modulating malaria-induced inflammation. It was also previously
shown that boosting p53 levels can reduce liver-stage parasite burden in a mouse malaria model. Thus, systemic
increases in host p53 may also benefit the host, and coincidently the established parasite, by inhibiting liver-
stage superinfection by other Plasmodium parasites. The goal of this proposal is to identify host pathways
amenable to therapeutic intervention that would either reduce malaria disease severity and/or prevent liver-stage
infection by Plasmodium parasites. Using both in vitro studies with human blood samples from malaria-exposed
individuals and mouse models, we propose to determine the mechanisms that drive the activation of p53 and
associated pathways in innate immune cells of malaria-exposed children. We will also investigate the systemic
effects of p53 activation in not only immune cells but also host tissue, namely the liver and vascular endothelium,
as it relates to Plasmodium infection and malaria pathogenesis. We hypothesize that chronic inflammation
induced by repeated malaria episodes, which frequently occurs in sub-Saharan African children, or chronic
parasitemia activates p53 and its downstream pathways systemically to modulate the host response to both the
current and subsequent Plasmodium infections. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: 1) investigate the effect
of Plasmodium infection on p53 and its downstream pathways in innate immune cells and their subsequent
response to repeat malaria exposure; 2) investigate the effect of Plasmodium blood-stage infection on p53 and
p53 downstream pathways within the host liver and determine the potential role for p53 in modulating liver-stage
superinfection; and 3) evaluate the role of p53 and p53 targets in regulating host vascular endothelium during
Plasmodium blood-stage infection. Completion of these proposed aims will provide mechanistic insight into the
role of p53 in modulating malaria-induced pathogenesis and liver-stage infection, which may identify druggable
targets for interventions aimed at mitigating malaria disease severity and/or liver-stage prophylaxis."

 The Clinical Core is integral to our CCRC’s activities coordinating and overseeing the access and distribution
of biospecimens obtained from well characterized coccidioidomycosis patients to all investigators. This core will
also provide regulatory support and, when necessary, assistance with study design and statistical analysis.
 This Core strengthens the coalition of expert clinical investigators with the fundamental aim of obtaining
biospecimens and comprehensive clinical data from subjects with coccidioidomycosis. Our program has
partnered with the two largest coccidioidomycosis clinical facilities in California: the Valley Fever Institute (VFI)
affiliated with the Kern County Medical System and located in Bakersfield, the epicenter of coccidioidomycosis
at the southern end of the California Central Valley; and the University of California Davis (UCD) Center of
Excellence in Valley Fever, located at the northern end of the Central Valley. These two centers, and the skilled
clinicians who run them, offer our program premier access to the key specimens and data needed to identify the
genetic and immunological causes of disseminated coccidioidomycosis (DCM). Coordinating patient samples
from two foremost institutions ensures a broadest variety of clinical phenotypes and diverse genomic ancestries
of the patients drawn from across the Central Valley of the state of California, and a major strength of this Core
is that the patient base we sample from will be among the largest and most diverse ever collected for
coccidioidomycosis.
 We propose two straightforward aims in this core. First, in Aim 1, we will provide clinical samples and data.
Biospecimens include blood and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Samples will be coded to de-identify.
Phenotype information will be captured in an electronic clinical Case Report Form and stored in REDCap. This
Core will work with the Administrative core to ensure oversight over samples. In Aim 2, the Clinical Core will
ensure ethical approvals and human subjects approvals are all in place. Biosafety protocols for shipping and
handling diagnostic specimens from patients will be developed and followed.
 The Clinical Core thus provides critical infrastructure and services for our research program to meet its goals
for all Projects requiring human specimens."
10748310,"Summary – Project 1
 Project 1 is a new collaborative approach to understand the innate immune pathways involved in the
host response to Coccidioides, an invasive pathogenic fungus resulting in 20,000 infections in the US annually.
Only 1-2% of patients infected develop a severe and frequently lethal form, known as disseminated
coccidiomycosis which affects brain, bones, and/or skin and usually requires lifelong therapy with anti-fungal
drugs to prevent death and reduce morbidity. The factors determining the course of infected patients are not
known, but it is likely that there is innate immune dysregulation in many of these patients that is genetically
determined. While we have learned a great deal about the normal host response to common invasive fungal
pathogens such as Candida and Aspergillus, there still remains much to be learned about Coccidioides.
 We will utilize a multi-pronged approach focusing on each major step of the innate immune response
including 1) pattern recognition 2) cytokine responses and 3) pathogen processing, and on the specific
molecular levels of this response such as RNA transcriptional regulation and cross-talk, protein translation and
post-translation processing, as well as cell function and cell-cell interaction. To accomplish our goals, we have
built a coalition of biomedical investigators at UCSD with a long history of collaboration, but a relatively new
shared interest in Coccidioides and an expert with more than 40 years of experience studying Coccidioides.
 Aim 1. Define the mechanisms by which Dectin-1 and inhibitory Siglecs regulate human myeloid cell
responses to coccidioides. Using myeloid cells from normal human donors we will characterize how human
dectin-1 recognition of Coccidioides regulates gene expression programs. Using gain-of-function studies we will
determine how iSiglec engagement inhibits Dectin-1 signaling. Finally, we will determine how human
polymorphisms in Dectin-1 signaling pathways alter the cellular immune response to Coccidioides.
 Aim 2. Identify the cellular source of IL-1 and IL-1 in coccidioides infection and the inflammasome
dependent and independent pathways controlling their processing and release
 Using human blood cells from cocci patients and controls or cells from specific knockout mice challenged
with killed Coccidioides spherules, we will examine and shed light on the role of inflammasome and non-
inflammasome mediated cleavage and release of IL-1 and IL-1 in the host response to Coccidioides infection.
 Aim 3. Investigate the contribution of activating and inhibitory receptors to inter-leukocyte shuttling of
coccidioides endospores. We will investigate the control of Coccidioides endospore shuttling by activating and
inhibitory receptors on mouse and human neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells.
 The overall impact of this work will improve our understanding of the immune response to Coccidioides
and improve our ability to predict outcomes in patients with coccidiomycosis."
10748313,"Abstract
 Disseminated coccidioidomycosis (DCM) can be explained by a combination of defective host defenses and
successful immune evasion by the fungus. Published data from our labs highlight the importance of T cells in
fighting fungal infections, and in going awry in disseminated disease. Our main goal is to discover the T cell
patterns and programs that mediate dysfunction and allow for invasive coccidioidomycosis.
 T-cell activation requires the antigens of the pathogen to be presented, and this process offers an
opportunity for adaptive immunity to founder. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) subtypes, commonly also
called HLA alleles, have been shown to play an important role in susceptibility to severe infection, including
coccidioidomycosis, because these molecules present antigenic peptides to T cells. Which HLA alleles contribute
to susceptibility has not been studied in over 20 years, and modern approaches including those published by
our team shed considerably more light on the antigen presentation process. Importantly, which peptides are
important for protection to coccidioidomycosis is as yet unknown. Our approach data includes a new technology
to empirically discover those key peptides of Coccidioides. In Aim 1, we will discover the antigenic peptides,
HLAs, and T-cell receptors that mediate DCM.
 Upon T-cell activation, transcriptional programs arise as cued by cytokines of the antigen presenting cells.
Our published and preliminary data support that T-cell dysfunction underlies the defective immune responses of
DCM. These aberrant responses may arise either due to genetic or epigenetic defects of the T cell program,
which may be due to rare or common genetic variants or haplotype variants associated with genetic ancestry.
These aberrant responses could also be due to abnormal skewing due to cytokines made by APCs. Clearance
of pathogens within a few days is requisite, or else persistent antigen exposure drives T cells to a profound
phenotypic switch that includes physical elimination of antigen-specific T cells, driving them to a state of antigen-
unresponsiveness, or driving them to a state of senescence. Our preliminary data support that in subjects with
DCM, T cells exhibit both an exhaustion and senescence phenotype. In Aim 2, we will first take an unbiased
approach to discover transcriptional patterns that highlight DCM versus UVF. We will pursue single-cell RNA-
seq and scATAC-seq to identify cells and patterns of transcription that correlate with disease. We will study
subjects with DCM who bear the markers of the three dysfunctional programs above with this approach. These
studies will enable discovery of the various subcategories of DCM patients and the functional deficiencies in their
T cells."
10748314,"Scientific Project 3: Human Genetic Risk Factors for Disseminated Coccidioidomycosis (DCM)
ABSTRACT
This project will focus on elucidating human host genetic risk variants that predispose individuals to DCM. For
the past 80 years, epidemiological studies have demonstrated that certain specific racial and ethnic groups were
more likely to progress towards severe disseminated Coccidioidomycosis, While many of these observations
have held up over, the underlying mechanistic and genetic pathogenesis underlying these epidemiological
observation have not been fully evaluated. There have been several major barriers to these types of genomic
studies where the relationship between host-genetic background and environment (here infection): 1) small-
sample sizes for most studies; 2) challenge of handling terabytes of genomic data; 3) limited sequencing data for
non-european populations;and 4) identifying relevant functional readouts to confirm the effect of variants in
relevant model systems. In this U19 proposal, project 3 brings together over 600 existing exome and genome
sequencing datasets and proposes to collect and sequence over 500 additional cases and controls. This will be
the largest genetic study of coccidioidomycosis to date. Key to this data analysis is the experts in this proposal
whose expertise enables us to handle Terabytes of data and to analyze it using ancestry-specific approaches.
We will explore two major hypotheses: that common variants that make up ancestry-specific approaches underly
race and ethnicity specific differences in DCM or that rare genetic variants in key immune signaling pathways
increase risk of DCM. Both hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive and may explain some of
the disease associations that have been observed. In addition to identifying the DNA variants, we will perform
ATAC-seq, RNA-sequencing studies to functionally validate non-coding and splicing changes caused by non-
coding genetic variants. A key aspect of this project is its ability to rapidly integrate with projects 1 and 2 and
Core C in order to validate novel genetic variants and their effects on immune pathways. It will allow us to directly
bridge the gap between identified genetic variants and clinical function."

This Project will focus on the pathogen by undertaking transcriptomic, proteomic and genome-scale studies of
Coccidioides species. Coccidioides species, C. immitis and C. posadasii, grow as a mycelium in the soil and
differentiate into a unique round structure called a spherule in the mammalian host – a hallmark of their
pathogenicity. Spherules enlarge and divide internally to form endospores which are released after about 4 days
in the mammalian host. The mechanisms of differentiation into spherules and virulence factors of Coccidioides
remain largely unknown. We are intrigued by the hypothesis that spherule-enriched genes and spherule surface-
attached proteins are major players of the immune evasion strategies adopted by the pathogen. Therefore, in
this Project, our overall goal is to identify genes/proteins that may play a role in (1) controlling transition from
environmental-to-parasitic growth or (2) directly interacting with the host to subvert immune responses. We will
take functional genomics and proteomic approaches to identify factors (i.e. transcriptional regulators) that are
required for the expression of spherule-specific genes and endospore-specific genes and characterize them for
their importance in spherule growth and spherule-specific gene expression profiles. In addition, we will identify
fungal genes that are important for response to susceptible and resistant murine hosts, identify the secreted,
surface-attached and/or GPI-anchored proteins from Coccidioides spherules, and generate knockout mutants of
the candidate genes, which will be selected based on these transcriptomic and proteomics studies and our
preliminary data. Mutants that show significant difference in eliciting cytokine response in cell culture will be
prioritized to be tested for virulence phenotypes in mouse model of coccidioidomycosis under the activities
planned in the Model Organism Core. Results of these experiments will reveal genes/proteins that are involved
in regulating the parasitic growth of Coccidioides and shed light onto the molecular details of interactions between
host and the pathogen."

Among pediatric brain tumors, medulloblastoma is the most common form. While most children with
medulloblastoma can be cured, ~25% of these kids will die, and those that survive will live with severe long-term
side effects as a result of the devastating effects of current therapies on the developing brain. In patients with
medulloblastoma, prognosis depends heavily on the molecular makeup of the tumor. New genomic approaches
have enabled to classify medulloblastoma into molecular subgroups, allowing physicians to better predict patient
outcome and design treatment adequately. Among these subgroups, patients having alterations in the
developmental pathway SONIC HEDGEHOG (SHH), along with mutations in the tumor suppressor gene P53
have a poor outcome. These tumors are resistant to therapy what results in rapid tumor relapse, which almost
uniformly leads to patient death. Loss of P53 activity results in significant genomic instability and, consequently,
large scale alterations in the signaling networks that drive cellular proliferation, survival, differentiation and/or
stemness are created. Subsequently, a smaller number of these networks are selected for during the tumorigenic
process and behave as tumor drivers. Here, I hypothesize that the growth of TRP53 mutant medulloblastoma
will be abrogated by targeting this P53-specific set of signaling pathways. My previous work allowed me to
identify two distinct drivers of these tumors, controlling independently tumor growth and propagation. The goal
of this proposal is to understand how these identified tumor drivers control overall medulloblastoma viability, and
to further validate them in murine and human derived TRP53 mutant SHH medulloblastoma models."

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a rapid onset respiratory failure that is caused by factors ranging
from pneumonia to sepsis. The impact of ARDS is substantial with more than 200,000 cases per year in the
United States and an estimated mortality rate of 40%. All ARDS patients are mechanically ventilated to overcome
the derangements in lung function caused by pulmonary edema, surfactant inactivation, and alveolar collapse.
However, this essential mechanical ventilation can cause additional ventilator-induced lung injured (VILI) through
tissue overdistension (volutrauma), the cyclic collapse and reopening of small airways and alveoli (atelectrauma),
and inflammatory effects (biotrauma). Since VILI is a risk in all ARDS patients, and a significant contributor to
ARDS mortality, improvements in ventilatory management are a key step in improving ARDS survival. However,
further refinement of ventilation protocols to reduce VILI is challenging because of differences between patients
and the changes in lung function that occur over time as ARDS worsens or resolves. Because of this inter- and
intra-patient variability, ventilation that is beneficial in one person can be harmful in another. To overcome this
challenge, we postulate that ventilation should be guided using a VILI cost function that provides real-time
feedback of ventilation safety by describing the amount of VILI that is occurring. Our study will define such VILI
cost functions based on the changes in lung function, structure, and inflammation that are the result of injurious
ventilation. Using the cost function as a guide, the optimally safe ventilation for each patient could be determined
by manually adjusting the ventilator settings. However, given the large number of permutations of ventilation
adjustments this is not a practical approach. Instead, we will develop a mathematical model to predict optimal
ventilation for each patient. These simulations will be personalized by fitting to real time pressure-flow
measurements and then used to find the ventilation pattern that minimizes the VILI Cost Function. The predicted
optimally safe ventilation will then be applied, and the process repeated to account for changes in lung function
over time. The potential benefits of the proposed study are substantial. The VILI cost functions we define will
provide an essential measurement of ventilation safety. Our innovative approach to optimize lung-protective
ventilation using predictive models may lead to decreased ARDS mortality by protecting the injured lung while,
at the same time, reducing provider workload. The proposed system also represents a paradigm shift in the way
that ventilation strategies are established. Instead of testing a strategy in animal models and then in the
heterogeneous ARDS patient population, where the effect may be beneficial to some patients and harmful to
others, focus may be directed towards identifying algorithms that predict and prevent VILI independent of ARDS
phenotype and lung mechanical function."

To infect airway epithelial cells, influenza A virus (IAV) must penetrate the secreted mucus and underlying
periciliary layer barriers – both comprised, in large part, of mucin glycoproteins that can be secreted or tethered
to the apical surface of cells. The importance of tethered mucins in various disease states and acute infection
is increasingly being realized. Specifically, tethered mucin 1 (MUC1) has been implicated in various aspects of
both bacterial and viral infections. However, these reports do not yield consensus on MUC1 function during
pathogenic insult and while it seems logical to assume that MUC1 expression would benefit the host, our
preliminary data indicate that MUC1 facilitates IAV infection. As MUC1 is expressed by multiple cell types that
influence IAV pathogenesis, including airway epithelial cells and macrophages, and has been proposed to act
as both a structural barrier and signaling molecule, we hypothesize that MUC1 facilitates IAV infection through
multiple mechanisms, involving both physical and functional attributes of MUC1, and multiple cell types. We
will test this hypothesis by pursing two specific aims: 1) Define the contribution of MUC1 expression in specific
cell compartments to IAV pathogenesis and 2) Define MUC1 molecular interactions and intracellular dynamics
in human airway epithelium during IAV infection. Aim 1 will generate a MUC1-expression atlas in the lung
during infection, determine the impact of MUC1 expression on IAV infection of both human and mouse primary
airway epithelial cells, and define the contribution of MUC1 expression in specific cell compartments to the
outcome of infection in vivo. Aim 2 will interrogate the physical interaction between IAV and MUC1 in
physiologically relevant models of airway epithelium and define the impact of IAV and interferon on MUC1
expression, activation, and interacting partners through mechanistic studies and comprehensive mass
spectrometry-based technology. This research is innovative in its use of novel in vitro and in vivo models with
altered MUC1 expression to dissect the interplay between IAV and MUC1 at both the molecular and
organismal level. Our results will be significant as defining MUC1 function in the context of IAV infection will
advance our understanding of tethered mucin biology and reveal mechanisms of how IAV negotiates specific
mucin molecules to efficiently infect the respiratory tract."
10753536,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of children, with an estimated 300 million cases worldwide and
with significant increases in incidence since the early 1980s. In the United States (U.S.), asthma prevalence,
morbidity, mortality, and drug response vary substantially among racial and ethnic groups. While asthma was
previously regarded as being a single clinical entity with a number of diagnostic criteria, it is now widely
recognized that asthma represents multiple different pathobiological and clinical subtypes, which may underlie
observed racial and ethnic variation. Furthermore, an individual's risk of developing asthma reflects a summation
of genetic as well as various clinical risk factors. Importantly, clinical risk factors are not randomly distributed
across racial and ethnic groups, and certain populations are more burdened than others.
Our goal in this work is to identify cell types, genes, and pathways altered by exposure to clinical risk factors,
thereby improving mechanistic understanding of asthma subtypes and elucidating the underlying networks by
which these risk factors affect asthma disparities. To achieve this goal, we will determine the epigenetic profiles
of patients with and without known asthma risk factors (Aim 1), identify common and unique epigenetic profiles
associated with known and novel clinical asthma subtypes (Aim 2), and examine the contribution of common
and unique epigenetic changes to the association of clinical risk factors with clinical asthma subtypes (Aim 3).
We hypothesize that DNA methylation will provide the bridge that ties clinical risk factors with asthma
disease subtypes and that this relationship may be modified by self-identified race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry
thereby contributing to asthma disparities. Strong preliminary data from our group and others have shown that
methylation, a long lasting but dynamic measure of cellular states, is highly correlated with exposure to clinical
asthma risk factors, including early life respiratory infection, obesity, and maternal history of asthma. To execute
this research program, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team with complementary expertise in
epidemiology, clinical asthma, genetics, epigenetics, and statistical methods. Our team will study a unique cohort
of minority children at the extremes of asthma prevalence and mortality (high risk Puerto Ricans and African
Americans, and low risk Mexican Americans), who have existing demographic data, clinical exposures,
genotypes, and RNA/DNA sequences. To our knowledge, there are no other groups within or outside the U.S.
with populations as detailed as ours that are large enough to be well powered for these analyses. Therefore, we
are the only group with the population needed and track record to successfully complete this project.
Findings from our work will help: (i) provide the clinical and biomedical research communities with the largest
methylation dataset on minority children produced to date, with a substantially increased value due to existing
clinical, socio-environmental, and genetic data, (ii) improve risk profiling, especially for minority children, and (iii)
precisely treat patients by selecting interventions using epigenetic markers accounting for clinical risk factors."

The long-term goal of this research is to translate years of federally-funded basic science on comprehension
processes and interventions to provide elementary-age children with strong, school-based language stimulation
to improve reading comprehension. The short-term goal of this proposal is to stimulate language and
comprehension skills in Grade 1 children at risk for reading comprehension failure by testing the efficacy of a
modified, small-group, version of the Let's Know! intervention, which has shown to be efficacious as a whole-
class curriculum. Let's Know! systematically targets lower- and higher-level language skills to improve both
language skills and listening comprehension. Delivering small-group instruction affords a targeted focus on
those children with low language abilities who are most at risk for poor reading comprehension, many of whom
have Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). To accomplish our goal, we have three specific aims: (a)
determine the efficacy of Let's Know! as a school-based, small-group, language-focused comprehension
intervention for promoting the lower-and higher-level language skills of Grade 1 children who are at risk for
comprehension difficulties due to low language, (b) determine the efficacy of Let's Know! for promoting the
comprehension skills of children who are at risk for comprehension difficulties due to low language, and (c)
determine the extent to which intervention effects are moderated by dosage, initial language skill, DLD status,
word reading skill, nonverbal IQ, and family socioeconomic status. The proposed project involves a
collaborative and multi-disciplinary partnership among researchers who study basic developmental processes
pertaining to language and reading acquisition as well as school-based prevention and intervention to support
language and reading skills. We use a three-phase approach to accomplish this clinical trial. Phase 1
encompasses key research activities to ready the intervention for implementation in Phase 2's randomized
controlled trial (RCT). Phase 2 comprises a multisite RCT to determine the efficacy of Let's Know! as a small-
group, language-focused comprehension intervention when implemented at children's respective schools. The
RCT will meet guidelines for high-quality efficacy trials in education and prevention science. Phase 3 will
comprise analyses of impacts on children's language and comprehension skills, in both the short- and long-
term, from Grade 1 through Grade 3 as well as moderation of effects. This proposal is innovative in three
primary ways. First, the proposal focuses on prevention of reading comprehension failure, in children most
vulnerable to failure, in a crucially important area of reading instruction that is weak or missing in most US
schools – explicit and systematic teaching of language and comprehension skills. Second, the study builds on
decades of basic research on comprehension processes and evidence-based pedagogical practices to translate
these into a practical intervention that fits squarely within the US educational system. Considering that
evidence-based practices are rarely implemented due to research-to-practice gaps, building the intervention to
fit in the current educational system increases its chance of implementation, if found to be efficacious. Third,
the proposal considers longitudinal impacts of the intervention and moderators of the effect, which has both
clinical and theoretical implications for comprehension processes and interventions."
10701772,"Veterans living with lower-limb amputation have poor physical health outcomes, multiple chronic comorbidities,
high medical service utilization, and high levels of disability. Self-reported disability for people living with lower-
limb amputation is greater than 95% of the general population. One way to reduce disability for Veterans with
lower-limb amputation is for them to participate in life-long sustained walking exercise. Regular exercise
improves functional independence and mental well-being, and reduces adverse effects of common
comorbidities associated with lower-limb amputation, such as diabetes and peripheral artery disease.
However, most Veterans with lower-limb amputation do not regularly exercise. Only 50% of people with lower-
limb amputation achieve levels of walking activity that support participation in their local community, creating a
critical need to improve physical exercise participation after lower-limb amputation. Evidence suggests that
clinician-supported exercise in a person’s home living environment that includes evidence-based promotion of
patient self-management has promise for interrupting the cycle of elevated sedentary behavior and poor health
outcomes. Therefore, the primary aim of this randomized controlled superiority trial is to determine if a
telerehabilitation walking exercise self-management program produces clinically meaningful walking exercise
sustainability compared to attention-control education. This novel, low-cost intervention includes a novel
combination of piloted behavior-change methods and clinical resources, including VA multidisciplinary
telehealth sessions, individual exercise self-management training, and VA Whole Health peer-group sessions.
In addition, the intervention is integrated within an established VA Regional Amputation Center, using
established VA clinical telerehabilitation and technology. Exercise and physical activity will be monitored as a
continuous daily outcome, with secondary outcomes assessed at a baseline test and then after 6 and 18
months of intervention participation. The primary outcome will be accelerometer-assessed daily walking step
count monitored continuously each day across the 18-month study period. Secondary outcomes are designed
to assess the potential to assess how to best translate the walking exercise intervention into conventional VA
amputation rehabilitation. These secondary outcomes include measures of intervention reach, intervention
efficacy, likelihood of clinical adoption, potential for clinical implementation, and ability of participants to
maintain long-term exercise behavior. The unique rehabilitation paradigm used in this study addresses the
problem of chronic sedentary lifestyles following lower-limb amputation with a home-based exercise model of
life-long exercise support from clinicians and peers. The trial results will advance rehabilitation knowledge and
provide the necessary evidence for larger clinical translation of self-management intervention to sustain
walking exercise for Veterans living with lower-limb amputation."
11135744,"Project Abstract
Racial and ethnic inequities in health care quality have been described across a broad range of clinical
settings, patient populations, and outcomes. Clinician implicit bias has been implicated in the causal pathway
for health care disparities. It is now imperative that we target the causes and develop interventions to mitigate
and eradicate such inequities. Our overarching goal is to eradicate health care inequities through evidence-
based interventions. In response to the RFA-NS-22-002: HEAL Initiative: Advancing Health Equity in Pain
Management (R61/R33), the objectives of this proposal are to develop and test the impact of two
interventions on overcoming clinician implicit bias and mitigating inequities in the management of pain among
children seeking care in the emergency department for the treatment of appendicitis or long bone fractures.
The scientific premise stems from our prior work which: 1) demonstrated racial and ethnic inequities in the
management of pain for children in the emergency department; 2) examined the role of implicit bias in vignette-
based health outcomes; and 3) used audit and feedback and clinical decision support tools to improve
performance metrics among clinicians. We will build on this foundational work by measuring the impact of
clinician implicit bias among providers and nurses on both process and outcome measures, including the
assessment and reduction of pain. We will use a stakeholder-informed approach to identify quality metrics that
are patient-centric. We will then test whether regular clinician audit and feedback, through the provision of
‘Equity Report Cards,’ as well as provision of real-time, electronic health record-embedded clinical decision
support can serve as useful interventions in mitigating racial/ethnic disparities in clinical outcomes. This
research is significant because both interventions can be inexpensively disseminated and scaled to emergency
departments nationally as well as to other clinical venues and adapted for various clinical conditions. Through
innovative study design and rigorous evaluation, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the
foundation for eradicating racial and ethnic inequities in the provision of care and improved child health
outcomes for all."
10771996,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although commensal and pathogenic bacteria can be recognized by host pattern recognition receptors,
intestinal epithelial cells target protective inflammatory responses towards pathogenic organisms through
mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Additional mechanisms of pathogen sensing must exist that
allow intestinal cells to target inflammatory defenses towards bona fide pathogens during an infection, and not
harmless commensal bacteria. Pathogenic bacteria can express virulence determinants. Phenazine toxins are
a family of redox active virulence determinants that are produced by a variety of human pathogens, including P.
aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa can colonize the intestines of immunocompromised patients and cause fulminant
septicemia and subsequent death. The mechanism by which intestinal epithelial cells detect P. aeruginosa, and
whether this involves the surveillance of phenazine toxins, is not known. Nuclear hormone receptors (NHR) are
transcription factors that program adaptive host responses following recognition of specific exogenous or
endogenous ligands. In particular, HNF4⍺ is an NHR expressed in the intestine. In the model organism C.
elegans, the HNF4⍺ homolog NHR-86 is required for the transcriptional activation of innate immune effector
genes that protect against P. aeruginosa infection. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that intestinal
epithelial cells detect infection through the surveillance of pathogen-derived phenazine toxins by NHR-86/
HNF4⍺, which directly activates protective anti-pathogen defenses in the intestinal epithelium. The following
key preliminary findings support this central hypothesis: i) P. aeruginosa mutants that cannot make phenazine
toxins do not activate C. elegans innate immune defenses; ii) synthetic phenazine toxins can activate immune
genes; and iii) induction of immune genes by phenazine toxins is dependent on the expression of NHR-86/
HNF4⍺. In this proposal, Aim 1 will characterize the C. elegans immune response towards bacterial phenazine
toxins, and Aim 2 will define the role of intestinal NHR-86/HNF4⍺ in detecting P. aeruginosa infection in C.
elegans. The research proposed here will define a new concept of immune activation in intestinal epithelial
cells and will also attribute a novel role for NHRs in pathogen sensing in the intestine. Insights from these
findings may identify unexplored approaches for the development of anti-inflammatory and anti-infective
therapies."
10761748,"The arrestin superfamily is composed of two subfamilies: the classical visual/beta-arrestins that were first identified as regulators of G-protein coupled receptor signaling, and the more ancient branch of arrestin domain-containing proteins that are sometimes called the “alpha-arrestins”. Recently, the roles of some members of the alpha-arrestin family have been revealed in mammalian metabolism. The most studied member of the alpha-arrestin family is thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), which regulates glucose and fructose metabolism. Arrestin domain-containing 4 (ARRDC4) is a member of the alpha-arrestin family that has not been subject to extensive investigation. The arrestin domains of ARRDC4 show 41% amino acid sequence similarity to TXNIP; therefore, ARRDC4 might be expected to have functions similar to TXNIP. However, we have shown that TXNIP is the only member of the family that binds covalently to thioredoxin. Consistent with our biochemistry studies, the recently solved crystal structure revealed that the cysteine 247 residue of TXNIP is essential for binding covalently to thioredoxin. Furthermore, we have reported that mice with deletion of TXNIP have improved insulin sensitivity, indicating a potential like between redox state and glucose
metabolism through thioredoxin. Here we show new unpublished experiments revealing that mice with global deletion of arrdc4 have improved insulin sensitivity. We also show improved insulin signaling in metabolic tissues from mice with deletion of arrdc4. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the ARRDC4 protein interacts directly with glucose transporter protein 4 (GLUT4) in insulin-stimulated conditions. Furthermore, we present a new mouse model with mutation of C247 of TXNIP and show that this single amino acid change in TXNIP improves insulin sensitivity in mice fed a High Fat Diet. In this project, we will use these new discoveries and mouse models to understand how arrestin domain-containing proteins regulate glucose metabolism in vivo and at the molecular mechanism level. Our Specific Aims are:  Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that alpha-arrestin protein ARRDC4 regulates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in vivo.  Specific Aim 2 will investigate the molecular mechanisms of alpha arrestin domain-containing protein interactions with glucose transporters and insulin receptor.  Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that TXNIP can regulate insulin sensitivity through thioredoxin-independent mechanisms and identify the target tissue responsible."
10756988,"Project Summary. The goal of this project is to develop, optimize, and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)-
driven, medical imaging platform that utilizes computed tomography (CT) imaging to identify the presence of
extranodal extension (ENE) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is a debilitating
disease with significant patient-related morbidity related to the disease itself and its management, which is
complex and consists of a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. A key factor in determining
proper HNSCC management is the presence of ENE, which occurs when tumor infiltrates through the capsule
of an involved lymph node into the surrounding tissue. ENE is both an important prognostic factor and an
indication for adjuvant treatment escalation with the addition of chemotherapy to radiation following surgery.
This “trimodality therapy” is problematic, as it is associated with increased treatment-related morbidity and
healthcare costs, but no improvement in disease control compared to upfront chemoradiation alone. The
challenge is that ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment
radiographic ENE identification has proven unreliable for even expert diagnosticians, leading to high rates of
trimodality therapy and suboptimal treatment outcomes. In HNSCC management there is a critical need for
improved pretreatment ENE identification to 1) select appropriate patients for surgery to avoid the excess
morbidity and costs of trimodality therapy, 2) risk-stratify patients optimally, and 3) select appropriate patients
for treatment de-escalation or intensification clinical trials. In recent years, Deep learning, a subtype of machine
learning, under the umbrella of AI, has generated breakthroughs in computerized medical image analysis, at
times outperforming human experts and discovering patterns hidden to the naked eye. While AI is poised to
transform the fields of cancer imaging and personalized cancer care, there remain significant barriers to clinical
implementation. The hypothesis of this project is that AI can be used to successfully identify HNSCC ENE on
pretreatment imaging in retrospective and prospective patient cohorts and to develop a platform for lymph
node auto-segmentation that will promote clinical utility of the platform.
This hypothesis will be tested by rigorous optimization and evaluation of a deep learning ENE identification
platform. Specifically, the platform will be validated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and discriminatory
performance on two heterogeneous retrospective datasets and two prospective cohorts derived from
institutional and national Phase II clinical trials for HNSCC patients. The platform will then be directly compared
with head and neck radiologists to determine if radiologist performance can be augmented with AI. In parallel,
AI will be utilized to develop an auto-segmentation platform for tumor and lymph nodes, which will 1) improve
the platform's clinical impact and 2) provide a valuable tool for treatment planning and future imaging-based
research for HNSCC patients.

10764944,"Brain activity is essential for the development and plasticity of neurons and circuits, however our
understanding of the mechanisms by which activity generates functional circuits is incomplete. This lack of
knowledge impedes our ability to take advantage of activity-dependent mechanisms to facilitate circuit
plasticity. Plasticity-inducing stimuli induce neuronal protein dynamics, including regulated increases and
decreases in protein synthesis. We recently conducted a quantitative in vivo proteomic analysis which
identified changes in newly synthesized proteins in the Xenopus tadpole visual system in response to
plasticity-inducing visual stimulation. We identified numerous candidate plasticity proteins (CPPs), including
several that regulate protein synthesis, whereas others have diverse cellular and synaptic functions. Here
we will probe the model that plasticity-inducing stimuli initiate a cascade of protein synthesis-dependent
events, beginning with de novo synthesis of upstream translational regulators and culminating in the
regulated synthesis of diverse effector proteins, in visual experience dependent circuit plasticity in Xenopus,
using proteomics, electrophysiology, in vivo structural and functional imaging, and behavioral assays.
Classical studies have revealed circuit-rewiring events in response to CNS damage. We have shown that
local damage to the optic tectum impairs visual avoidance behavior in Xenopus and that treating injured
animals with brief bouts of visual experience facilitates recovery of the injured circuit. To probe the flexibility
of experience-dependent plasticity mechanisms, we will test whether newly synthesized candidate plasticity
proteins are required for the visual experience-dependent rehabilitation of the injured visuomotor circuit.
Results of these experiments may identify novel mechanisms contributing to experience-dependent
plasticity in developing nervous systems."

10761767,"Summary
Most human genes contain introns, and presence of introns often increases the expression of the host gene, a
phenomenon known as intron-mediated enhancement (IME). IME has been observed in diverse genes in
animals, plants and fungi and often varies in magnitude across introns. However, little is known about how
introns impact expression or what intron features modulate IME activity. Recently, we have described a novel
phenomenon that we call exon-mediated activation of transcription starts (EMATS), in which the splicing of
internal exons impacts the spectrum of promoters used and expression level of the gene. EMATS acts at a
distance of up to a few kb, can alter gene expression by at least severalfold, and appears more active at
certain promoters – especially intrinsically weak promoters. The detailed sequence requirements and mode of
action of EMATS are not yet known. This proposal is seeks to understand the rules that govern IME and
EMATS, to improve the prediction of gene expression and to enable methods to modulate gene expression by
altering splicing. It is organized around the following aims.
SA1. Determine the sequence dependence of intron-mediated enhancement.
SA2. Explore the scope and rules for EMATS regulation.
In Aim 1, we will generate a library of many thousands of distinct random sequences inserted into an intron in a
dual fluorescent reporter system that is chromosomally integrated into human cells. This design will enable
high-throughput measurement of the effects of each intron on nascent RNA, mature RNA and protein levels,
and these data will be used to identify motifs that enhance or silence expression in a splicing-dependent
manner from an intronic location. In aim 2, we will systematically derive and test rules for how EMATS
regulation depends on the location and sequence of the internal exon and on properties of the involved
promoter. Finally, we will use the information learned about IME and EMATS to improve predictions of gene
expression from primary sequence. Together, the research described in these aims will establish rules
governing how splicing impacts gene expression in mammalian genomes. Identification of motifs that function
as splicing-dependent activators or silencers of expression can be used to improve prediction of expression
from genome sequence and may enable detection of intronic variants that alter expression. Understanding
how splicing impacts expression may also enable new approaches for gene expression modulation."
10749876,"Background: Starting in 2013, VA's Opioid Safety Initiative expanded resources for pain management and
successfully reduced high-risk opioid prescriptions. MISSION Act expansion of VA Community Care (CC)
includes authorization for CC providers to prescribe opioids for outpatient treatment of acute and chronic pain,
but charges VA with ensuring that these are safely and appropriately dispensed from VA pharmacies. Veterans
who use both VA and non-VA services may be particularly at risk for opioid-related harms, but past work was
conducted before MISSION Act implementation and mainly addressed services paid by non-VA insurers.
Although the main goal of MISSION Act is to improve Veterans' health care access, it remains unclear how CC
expansion has impacted opioid safety and patient-reported outcomes for Veterans.
Significance & Impact: Reducing opioid-related harms and improving treatment for chronic pain are high-
priority goals for VA HSRD and clinical services. Given increasing numbers of Veterans now using CC, there is
an urgent need to better understand Veteran, community, and VA facility factors associated with receipt of CC
opioids, and explore potential differences in higher-risk CC prescriptions, compared with VA-prescribed opioids.
Moreover, examination of Veteran-centered pain outcomes will address the ORD-wide priority of increasing real-
world impact of VA research.
Innovation: This study will be the first to evaluate Veteran-centered outcomes associated with CC opioids,
including functioning and health-related quality of life. The proposed design also includes multiple elements to
rigorously address multilevel confounders, including variation in community opioid prescribing patterns. We use
innovative causal estimation methods in our predictive models, in order to understand the relative importance of
a variety of factors in contributing to likelihood of receiving CC opioids.
Specific Aims: 1) Identify key multilevel predictors of receiving any CC vs. only VA-prescribed opioids for
outpatient pain treatment, and evaluate potential differences in higher-risk opioid prescriptions; and 2) for a
national prospective cohort of Veterans receiving any CC vs. only VA-prescribed opioids, examine differences
in patient-reported outcomes and acute care episodes over 1 year.
Methodology: First, we will conduct a retrospective analysis using national VA data from January-December
2021 to determine key Veteran, community, and VA facility factors that predict receiving any CC-prescribed
opioids. Then, we will use propensity score adjusted models to examine differences in higher-risk opioids
prescriptions between Veterans receiving any CC vs. only VA-prescribed opioids. For Aim 2, we will enroll a
prospective national cohort to evaluate outcomes associated with receiving any CC vs. only VA-prescribed
opioids. We will use survey data (at baseline and 1-year follow-up) to assess patient-reported outcomes (pain-
related functioning, pain severity, quality of life, and satisfaction with pain care) and acute care episodes
(hospitalizations and emergency department visits).
Implementation & Next Steps: We will disseminate study results to various stakeholders, including Veterans,
VA staff, and VA leadership. The exact next steps will depend on the nature of findings and their immediate
relevance to different stakeholders. We will work with our operational partners in the VA Program for Pain
Management, Opioid Safety and PDMP, Office for Medication Safety, and Office of Community Care to develop
the dissemination plan. We will also seek feedback from our Veteran Engagement Panel to inform dissemination
efforts. We will communicate findings through presentations and publications, cyber-seminars, and involvement
with groups or networks focused on improving CC services and pain treatment for Veterans."
10804593,"Background: Exercise is an evidence-based intervention for the management of chronic conditions, yet the
majority of Veterans are inactive. Group telehealth (GT) delivered exercise can potentially improve access to
and participation in exercise. GT exercise sessions may increase exercise participation by providing social
support, but a better understanding of the feasibility and acceptability of this format is needed. Telehealth
delivered exercise programs should be designed with initiation and maintenance phases, but there is not
consensus regarding the strategies for delivering exercise maintenance interventions. Skills for exercise
initiation and maintenance differ, and interventions that focus on one or the other are not likely to result in
sustained exercise participation.
Significance/Impact: As the Veterans Health Administration is the largest integrated health care system in the
US, implementing successful exercise programs could have a profound impact of public health. National
priorities including telehealth and access to care as well as management of chronic conditions will be
addressed by the development of this GT exercise initiation and maintenance intervention.
Innovation: GT exercise combines the benefits of group exercise sessions, such as social support, and
telehealth technology. There have been no studies comparing GT exercise booster sessions plus text
messaging to text messaging alone to support exercise maintenance. These two strategies will be used as a
multi-faceted approach to improving exercise maintenance.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Adapt evidenced-based exercise components for a group telehealth (GT) exercise intervention, guided
by stakeholder input. Using qualitative methods, I will explore the perspectives of stakeholders through focus
groups and interviews. Intervention development will include an iterative approach and formative evaluation.
Aim 2: Conduct a randomized pilot trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the GT exercise initiation
and maintenance program. I will use lower extremity osteoarthritis (OA) as a model to conduct this work
because: 1) lower extremity osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent condition among Veterans, 2) exercise is a first
line recommendation for the management of lower extremity OA, and 3) I have previous experience in OA.
Veterans with lower extremity OA (n=50) will be randomized to the intervention. I will assess feasibility (i.e.
referral, retention, data collection) and acceptability (i.e. number of sessions attended, number of text message
responses, participant and provider feedback).
Aim 3: Determine contextual factors related to successful implementation and sustainability of telehealth-
delivered exercise programs within VA. Gerofit, an existing telehealth-delivered VA exercise program
implemented at multiple sites, will be used as a model. An explanatory sequential mixed methods design will
be used to describe site characteristics and simultaneously explore the perspectives of the site personnel,
using survey and interview data.
Methodology: The Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM), a conceptual
framework for translating health interventions into practice, will be used with Dissemination and Implementation
Science methods. Specifically, qualitative methods will be used to obtain stakeholder perspectives to design a
GT delivered exercise program. A randomized pilot trial design will be used to pilot the GT exercise
intervention to evaluate feasibility and acceptability. Mixed methods will be used to identify contextual factors
related to successful implementation and sustainment.
Next Steps/Implementation: This formative work will be used in a future larger, single site trial to test the
effectiveness and evaluate the implementation of the GT exercise initiation and maintenance intervention."
10767876,"Africa bears the vast majority (69%) of the world’s current HIV infections with 26 million persons living with HIV
(PLHIV). Increased access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Africa has markedly extended the lives of PLHIV
and is shifting morbidity and mortality among PLHIV toward non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including
high burden cardiopulmonary NCDs (CP-NCDs) such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, asthma, and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, Africa is experiencing rapid urbanization with its associated
increases in air pollution and changes in lifestyle and the social, structural, and health service environment.
This remarkable convergence of HIV, CP-NCDs, and urbanization has profound implications for the future of
global health. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of data on the impact of urbanization and air pollution on CP-
NCDs and the potential role of HIV as an effect modifier, e.g. PLHIV may be more susceptible to urban ills due
to existing chronic inflammation despite suppressed HIV viremia or from sequelae of past tuberculosis or other
pulmonary infections. In addition, little is known about HIV and CP-NCDs health service utilization patterns as
people migrate to urban settings and how HIV and CP-NCD care might be better integrated. Finally, HIV and
CP-NCDs research in Africa has primarily been cross-sectional and often without HIV-negative comparison
groups, major limitations in understanding causal factors and accurately calculating attributable fractions for
traditional and non-traditional risk factors. Longitudinal, population-level approaches are needed to better guide
future research, programs, and policies. The Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), established in 1994, is
an open, population-based cohort in 40 communities in south-central Uganda with survey rounds conducted
over ~18 month intervals (RCCS census population ~33,000 adults, HIV prevalence ~18%). RCCS
communities are non-urban; however, the cohort experiences an out-migration of ~950 participants per round
to two large urban centers (Kampala and Masaka) where RCCS has satellite offices. With this unique research
infrastructure, RCCS offers a novel opportunity to conduct longitudinal, population-based research on the HIV,
CP-NCDs, and urbanization syndemic within a comprehensive health determinants framework. This study
proposes to (i) Characterize HIV-related and -unrelated risk factors for cardiopulmonary non-communicable
diseases in a novel Rural-to-Urban (R2U) African cohort; (ii) Characterize the impact of air pollution and
moderating effects of HIV on cardiopulmonary outcomes among R2U migrants; and, (iii) Assess HIV and CP-
NCDs health services utilization patterns among R2U migrants. To our knowledge, this would be the first
population-based, longitudinal cohort study of the HIV, CP-NCDs, and urbanization syndemic in Africa. Our
unique ability to leverage a rural-to-urban cohort, the excellent research infrastructure, and novel Aims will
generate vital data needed for designing new research, interventions, and policies to combat the evolving HIV
and CP-NCDs epidemic."
10752640,"Background: The first four years after military service separation, while Veterans are reintegrating into civilian
life, is the highest risk period for suicide among Veterans. Veterans also face a number of reintegration
challenges resuming civilian life roles. Importantly, women and men Veterans may experience this period
differently. This study will provide valuable data on the reintegration experiences of Veterans at risk for suicide
across six key domains of Veteran reintegration, identify reintegration experiences associated with increased
suicide risk, and elucidate gender differences in reintegration experiences and associated suicide risk.
Significance: This study will increase our understanding of suicide risk during Veteran reintegration and will
support development of prevention efforts tailored for women Veterans during this period. These data are
needed to inform recent executive orders and VA initiatives calling for increased suicide prevention efforts
among reintegrating Veterans; findings from this study will identify subgroups of reintegrating Veterans most in
need of valuable resources and which reintegration challenges are especially problematic and when – enabling
VA to develop selective prevention approaches within this important population.
Innovation & Impact: This study moves the field beyond cross-sectional studies of suicide risk among
Veterans of recent eras and is carefully designed to study gender differences in suicide risk, building on the
body of research and theory in suicide prevention and emerging findings of gender differences in suicide risk.
Furthermore, this study is innovative in its linking of VA-DoD datasets to identify a national sample of newly
separated Veterans at increased risk of suicide who are not necessarily engaged in VA healthcare.
Specific aims: The specific aims of this study are to: 1) Model the trajectories of reintegration challenges of at-
risk Veterans to identify population subgroups (e.g., stable, deteriorating, improving) and examine gender
differences in reintegration experiences, 2) Identify associations between trajectories identified in Aim 1 and
suicide-risk-related predisposing factors among women and men, and 3) Identify associations between
trajectories identified in Aim 1 and development, or worsening, of suicide risk (suicidal ideation, suicide
cognitions, suicide attempts) and any effect measure modification by gender.
Methodology: This is a national cohort survey study. We will enroll a cohort of 2,000 Veterans separating from
service in the prior six months, identified using the VA-DoD Veteran Identity Repository (VADIR) data. We will
oversample for women to enroll a cohort that is approximately half women. We will also oversample for risk
indicators available in Department of Defense (DoD) healthcare data available through DaVINCI (i.e., prior
mental health inpatient/outpatient visit, emergency department visit, other outpatient visit). After completing the
baseline survey, participants will complete 6 additional surveys over the course of a 36 month follow up period.
Surveys will include measures that assess functioning in the six core domains of reintegration challenges
(mental and physical heath, identity/role negotiation, relationship quality, financial well-being, spirituality) as
well as predisposing factors associated with increased risk for suicide and measures assessing suicide risk
(suicidal ideation, suicide cognitions, suicide attempts). Main analyses will identify the reintegration trajectories,
including any gender differences, examine the suicide-related predisposing factors associated with
deteriorating trajectories, and examine suicide risk outcomes associated with reintegration trajectories.
Next steps: Data gathered in this study will directly inform the many VA initiatives, legislation, and recent
executive orders calling for increased suicide prevention efforts among reintegrating Veterans by providing the
necessary data to identify subgroups of Veterans at increased risk of suicide and their respective needs –
directing valuable resources. The VA Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and the VA Office of
Social work are strong partners in these efforts and will support dissemination and implementation of findings."
10754902,"The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction and increased inflammation
mediates age-related kidney disease. We propose that increased expression of estrogen related receptors ERRα
and ERRγ improves mitochondrial function, and decreases cGAS-STING signaling, cellular senescence and
inflammation, which reverses age-related kidney disease. In addition, the effects of ERRs on senescence,
inflammation, and fibrosis are cGAS-STING dependent. Furthermore, increased expression of ERRα and ERRγ
or inhibition of cGAS-STING signaling prevents acute kidney injury mediated by folic acid, LPS, or
ischemia/reperfusion
In SPECIFIC AIM 1 we will test the hypothesis that increased renal tubular ERRα or ERRγ will improve
mitochondrial function and inflammation and reverse age-related kidney disease. We will determine: A)
the effects of renal tubular ERRα or ERRγ or simultaneous ERRα/ERRγ increased expression on kidney
mitochondrial function, inflammation and kidney disease; B) if renal tubular increases in ERRs prevents acute
kidney injury mediated by a) folic acid, b) LPS, or c) ischemia/reperfusion. The rationale for these studies is that
all three models result in decreased ERRα and ERRγ expression in the kidneys; C) direct effects of increased
expression of ERRα, ERRγ, or simultaneous ERRα and ERRγ in human proximal tubular cells.
In SPECIFIC AIM 2 we will test the hypothesis that the effects of ERRα or ERRγ to reverse inflammation
and kidney disease in aging are mediated via a cGAS-STING dependent mechanism. We will determine
the roles of A) cGAS: generalized or kidney specific cGAS knockout mice treated with ERR; B) STING:
generalized or kidney specific STING knockout mice treated with ERR; C) We will determine if treatment of mice
with STING inhibitor prevents acute kidney injury mediated by a) folic acid, b) LPS, or c) ischemia/reperfusion.
The rationale for these studies is that all three models result in increased cGAS-STING expression in the kidneys.
INNOVATION: 1) These studies will determine if inducible increased expression of ERR-α and ERR-γ in the
renal tubules will improve mitochondrial dysfunction, cGAS-STING mediated inflammation and age-related
kidney disease. 2) While the effects of ERRs in regulation of mitochondrial function has been studied, mainly in
other target organs, the effects of ERRs in regulation of inflammation is novel and has not been studied in the
kidney. To this end we will perform mechanistic studies to determine the role of cGAS-STING in regulating
inflammation and the effects of ERR in the kidney."

The mammalian genome is pervasively transcribed to generate a complex non-coding transcriptome. A novel
class of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) called DoGs for “Downstream-of-Gene”-containing transcripts was
recently discovered. In response to various stressors such as viral infections, DoG RNAs are expressed by
readthrough transcription that continues past the ends of some protein-coding genes for at least 5kb. Remarkably,
this previously unknown RNA species as a group accounts for up to 30% of all intergenic transcripts, yet their
function remains completely unknown. I discovered that innate immune sensing of viral nucleic acids and
activation of the type I interferon (IFN) antiviral response leads to expression of DoG RNAs from thousands of
genes, most notably from the IFN gene itself. I therefore hypothesize that a DoG RNA may function to
regulate its upstream gene of origin, and that this is an essential regulatory process in innate antiviral
responses. Mechanistically I propose that a DoG RNA remodels the chromatin and/or transcriptional
landscape of its upstream gene to achieve a poised state. This would be beneficial for organisms because
rapid responses to viral infections can be achieved. In Aim 1, I will evaluate the role of the DoG RNA from the
Ifnb1 gene (Ifnb1-DoG RNA) in regulating IFN-β expression using genetic, transcriptional, and post-
transcriptional approaches to manipulate DoG RNA levels. In Aim 2, I will investigate the molecular basis of
Ifnb1-DoG RNA function by characterizing the chromatin and transcriptional landscape of the Ifnb1 gene locus.
I will test whether DoG RNA expression affects post-transcriptional processing, epigenetic marks, and chromatin
architecture. In Aim 3, I will determine the physiological importance of DoG RNA in vivo. I will generate Ifnb1-
DoG RNA deficient mice by first generating guide RNA knock-in mice that targets downstream of Ifnb1 and then
by crossing these with dCas9 transgenic mice. I will study the effect of the Ifnb1-DoG RNA on innate immunity
at homeostasis and during viral infections with these mice. The type I IFN response is a critical component of
our antiviral defense mechanism, but can lead to human disease such as type I interferonopathies and systemic
lupus erythematosus when dysregulated. This study aims to advance our understanding of type I IFN regulation
by functionally characterizing a novel class of lncRNAs. Insights gained from this study can potentially be
leveraged to develop improved therapeutics for infectious and IFN-mediated autoimmune diseases."

Vitamin D (Vit D) deficiency is estimated to affect over 1 billion people worldwide and is now considered a global
health crisis. In addition to maintaining calcium homeostasis and bone health, Vit D plays an important role in
regulating adaptive immunity. Low Vit D levels correlate with various immune-mediated diseases, including
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), while Vit D signaling through the vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been linked
to immune tolerance. Central to IBD pathogenesis is the dysregulation of proinflammatory Th17 cells, a subset
of CD4 T cells that are characterized by their production of interleukin-17A (IL-17A). While these cells normally
contribute to homeostasis at mucosal barrier sites, Th17 cells are pathogenic in IBD. We have shown that VDR
is upregulated during Th17 differentiation and treatment with Vit D inhibits Th17 production of proinflammatory
cytokines (e.g., IL-17A) in favor of the immunosuppressive cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10). How Vit D treatment
modulates the Th17 response is unclear. To define its mechanism of action, we have generated two
complementary murine models that have VDR reporter activity and are conditional knockouts for the VDR ligand
binding domain (LBD). Based on our preliminary data, we propose that VDR signaling directly antagonizes
activity of the central transcription factor of Th17 cells, RORgt, to negatively regulate Th17 development and
function—thereby modulating colitis pathogenicity. In this proposal, we will use our novel transgenic models to
determine whether there is heterogeneity of VDR expression within Th17 populations and whether ligand binding
by VDR is essential for its actions in limiting Th17 pathogenicity in colitis. Improving our understanding of how
this pathway can modulate Th17 function to protect against immune-mediated diseases, such as IBD, will have
broad-reaching implications on patient intestinal health and therapy.
 The proposed training plan for Blake Frey is sponsored by his mentor, Dr. Casey Weaver. The overall goal of
the training plan is to provide the PI with a strong foundation for a successful career as a physician-scientist. A
project that is clinically relevant, while focused on a fundamental mechanism of disease pathogenesis,
represents the ideal training opportunity for an aspiring physician-scientist. As molecular information becomes
more integral to patient care, the ability to understand and interpret these types of data will be essential. Providing
Blake with the skills to understand the clinical influence of environmental factors on gastrointestinal immune
function will enable him to expand our understanding and application of molecular processes to further
understand disease and personalize patient therapy. Included in the training plan are experiences that will help
the PI: 1) gain competence in a variety of techniques that integrate immunogenetics and bioinformatics; 2)
develop hypothesis-driven research; 3) present data in an oral and written format; 4) effectively integrate
research and the clinic; 5) collaborate with other scientists; and 6) responsibly conduct research."

Veterinarians are broadly trained health professionals uniquely qualified to participate in biomedical research,
having an understanding of health and disease at the organismal level with an appreciation of comparative
biology1,2.The “One Health” concept, integrating discoveries in both human and veterinary medicine, has
received increased attention with new and emerging zoonoses, as well as increasingly common chronic
conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus), and increased concerns with the effects of
environmental and dietary toxins on fetal and early stages of development. As translational research with animal
models continue to expand to approximately half of all current NIH research projects1, veterinarians, particularly
those with research training, make increasingly valuable contributions to biomedical research.3 Reports by
National Academy of Sciences National Research Council Committees concluded that there is a critical shortage
of such veterinarians4,5. The Texas A&M University summer Veterinary Student Research Training Program
(VMSRTP) is evolving and expanding during our next T35 renewal period. In addition to our previous goal to
introduce veterinary students to the biomedical research environment to entice trainees to discover research as
an exciting career option, we will now expand our program recruitment efforts to include veterinary
students who have previous research experience. Providing these experienced students with a robust
summer biomedical research experience with experienced federally funded mentors and enhanced training in
responsible conduct of research methods and scientific communication skills will likely enhance their individual
research successes, and further establish their interest and commitment to veterinary careers in biomedical
research. In this competitive renewal, the program will be led by a new Program Director, a new Program
Coordinator, a reconfigured Advisory Committee, and a more focused research mentor base with 27 experienced
mentors with strong federal extramural biomedical funding. The summer program includes: 1) biomedical
research in a mentor’s laboratory; (2) at least 12 hours formal training in responsible conduct of research; (3)
weekly lunchtime (hour-long) training sessions in scientific communication via oral and poster presentations,
abstract and manuscript preparation, as well as training in critical evaluation and presentation of primary journal
articles; (4) oral research presentations in the annual CVM research symposium; and 5) research poster
presentations at the National Veterinary Scholars Symposium. The program has exceptional institutional support
and a broad array of state-of-the-art facilities, including preclinical GLP labs, a national biodefense lab, primate
center, strong institutional collaborations, and a recently funded DHHS Biodefense vaccine center. A major
obstacle to the efforts of academic institutions to produce more research veterinarians is the difficulty of providing
adequate salary sources to introduce trainees to research. The training positions provided by this T35 would
assist recruiting efforts, increase numbers of veterinarians in research, and help alleviate this national shortage."
10753492,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a low-abundance plasma protein that reduces the expression of the LDL receptor (LDLR) and therefore plays a critical role in cholesterol trafficking. Its discovery revolutionized our understanding of cholesterol metabolism, shifting the homeostatic paradigm from a system where all the molecular determinants of cholesterol production and internalization are regulated by cellular responses, to one where the highest level of regulation is based extracellularly. Although the mechanism of action of PCSK9 on LDLR is well established, our understanding of the functional output and kinetic pathway of PCSK9 remains limited. We present preliminary results on three common post-translational modifications that alter PCSK9 and drive kinetic and functional changes: 1. Binding to apoB-containing lipoproteins (we now show that it prolongs plasma half-life of PCSK9 and increases its binding affinity to the LDLR); 2. Cleavage by furin (we now show that this is an extracellular event, and that furin-cleaved PCSK9 has accelerated clearance, impaired apoB-binding, and preserved ability to induce LDLR degradation intracellularly); and 3. N- glycosylation (we now show that non-glycosylated PCSK9 is less stable than its glycosylated form). Thus, the first aim of this competing renewal application focuses on how these post-translational modifications impact PCSK9 kinetics and function and affect cholesterol metabolism. Improved understanding of the global and net effect of plasma PCSK9 will open avenues for innovative diagnostic tools and tailored interventions to block PCSK9 action and lower plasma LDL cholesterol levels. Moreover, we have recently reported that therapeutic monoclonal antibodies inhibiting PCSK9 activity also induce a rapid and drastic (up to 20-fold) increase in plasma PCSK9 levels in patients receiving a few injections. This effect offers an opportunity to investigate the regulation of PCSK9 in plasma and to refine our knowledge of the turnover of this critical protein. We present preliminary data showing that the rise in plasma PCSK9 in humans occurs within a few hours after the first antibody injection, and can be reproduced in the mouse model, an observation that we will exploit for rigorous investigations of PCSK9 synthesis, secretion, processing, and clearance. Thus, the second aim of the program will elucidate the effect of plasma PCSK9 blockade on the regulation of hepatic PCSK9 synthesis or secretion in relation to its expected influence on PCSK9 clearance. Overall, the proposed work will provide an improved understanding of PCSK9 kinetics and activity on LDLR regulation, and may identify novel targets for pharmacologic inhibition of PCSK9."
10747899,"During development, retinal neurons make exquisitely precise connections with specific synaptic partners.
These synaptic choices impact the computational capacity of retinal circuits, and thereby influence visual per-
ception. Cell-surface recognition molecules mediate synaptic choices by encoding two kinds of trans-cellular
signals: 1) attractive signals that connect neurons with their circuit partners; 2) repulsive signals that shun non-
target cells. Both types of cues are needed for precise retinal wiring, but the molecular mechanisms underlying
rejection of inappropriate synaptic partners are unknown. The objective here is to identify recognition mecha-
nisms that prevent connections between inappropriate synaptic partners. Our central hypothesis is that FLRT
and UNC5 families of cell-surface molecules mediate repulsive receptor-ligand interactions that prevent cross-
circuit synapse formation. The rationale for this work is that it will reveal a new class of synaptic choice recog-
nition molecules that act through repulsive mechanisms. Understanding how the wrong synapses are avoided
is a necessary step towards ultimately deciphering the molecular logic underlying synaptic partner choice. To
this end, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Identify ligands that prevent retinal neurons from se-
lecting inappropriate synaptic partners. Retinal circuits occupy parallel sublayers within the inner plexiform
layer (IPL) neuropil. This arrangement facilitates synapse specificity by bringing together arbors of circuit part-
ners in a defined location where they are segregated from non-target cells. In preliminary studies using the
mouse direction-selective (DS) circuit as a model, we obtained preliminary evidence that the UNC5C cell sur-
face protein is a repulsive ligand that confines DS circuit arbors to their appropriate sublayers. This hypothesis
will be tested using Unc5c mutant mice and Unc5c misexpression in vivo. 2) Identity receptor-mediated mo-
lecular mechanisms that enforce synaptic specificity. Preliminary studies led us to hypothesize that the
cell surface protein FLRT2, which is expressed by DS circuit neurons, serves as an UNC5C receptor that con-
fines DS circuit arbors to their appropriate sublayers. This hypothesis will be tested using biochemical and in
vivo genetic approaches. 3) Determine cellular mechanisms by which retinal neurons shun inappropriate
synaptic partners. During dendrite growth, many exploratory branches are eliminated. Our preliminary data
suggest that elimination of mistargeted arbors is impaired in Flrt2 and Unc5c mutants. We therefore hypothe-
size that UNC5C-FLRT2 repulsion eliminates errant branches to prevent neurons from accessing inappropriate
synaptic partners. This idea will be tested by time-lapse imaging of nascent DS circuit dendrites and synapses
in Flrt2 and Unc5c mutants. Completion of these Aims is expected to define cellular and molecular mecha-
nisms by which neurons avoid incorrect synaptic choices. This contribution will be significant because, once
repulsive mechanisms for synapse specificity are known, it will become possible to comprehend how repulsion
and attraction work together to produce the overarching molecular logic of synaptic partner choice."

new TB infections (TBI) and for progression of LTBI to active TB disease. Literature on immunity
in HIV exposed uninfected infants is inconclusive. role of a Th2 bias and
of regulatory T cells (T regs) also need consideration. For this proposal, we have access to
and plasma of maternal-infant samples from a completed IMPAACT trial (P1078). This study was
to test the safety of Isoniazid preventative therapy (IPT) during pregnancy or post-partum in
women who were followed until I year post-partum. Incidence of LTBI was tested by IGRA
gamma release assay). Approximately 30% of the women were IGRA positive at study entry.
infants, approximately 5.6% were IGRA + at 12 weeks and remained positive at 44 weeks. In Aim
we will test the hypotheses that HIV exposed uninfected (HEU) infants whose mothers have LTBI during
are sensitized to mycobacterial antigens in utero, develop immunologic memory to Mtb and
an altered response to BCG vaccination . For this aim we will perform detailed analyses of CD4 T cell
subsets as well as antigen specific intra-cellular cytokine memory response to RD-1 antigens
 and ESAT-6, a DosR latency antigen and to PPD by flow cytometry. In Aim 2 we hypothesize that
factors such as Ab to Mtb can influence the infant immune response . For this aim a systems
approach for biophysical and functional characterization of FcR binding Ab will be performed in
plasma at delivery and infant plasma at weeks 12 and 44, for ascertaining longevity of passively
maternal Ab. Cytokine profile, country of origin, and IPT during pregnancy will be included in
analysis of maternal-infant immunity. In Aim 3 we hypothesize that infants diagnosed with LTBI in the
year of life have distinct gene transcriptomic profiles in monocytes and antigen specific CD4+ T cells
to those who are not infected with TB . In this aim we will profile CD4 T cells and monocytes
single cell transcriptomics. Transcriptional profiles will be correlated with immunologic profile by flow
and Ab profile by systems serology described in Aims 1 and 2 These studies are relevant for
immunological mechanisms of maternal-infant interaction in the context of LTBI in HIV+

Too many patients do not receive evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for mental health problems. In response,
implementation science has rapidly advanced to bring EBTs to routine practice settings, and thereby improve
patient outcomes. Unfortunately, research on sustainability of EBTs remains alarmingly limited. This is
concerning, given that EBT activities and benefits regularly decline post-implementation. To prevent these
declines, research on sustainability is urgently needed. Per NIMH’s Strategic Plan 4.2, this F32 will advance
research on sustainability – namely, sustainability (a) outcomes, (b) predictors, and (c) mechanisms – by
leveraging an ongoing, parent R01 (R01MH120147). The R01 focuses on implementation of an EBT in 10 of
California’s community mental health centers (CMHCs). Specifically, the CMHCs partnered with the R01 team
to implement the Transdiagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (TranS-C) for individuals
with serious mental illness. Additionally, the R01 was designed to test whether manipulating TranS-C to “fit” the
CMHC context would improve implementation outcomes by randomizing CMHCs to deliver Standard TranS-C
or Adapted TranS-C. Thus, the R01’s infrastructure allows this F32 to test three primary aims. Consistent with
Shediac-Rizkallah and Bone’s sustainability framework, Aim 1 will evaluate qualitative and quantitative
sustainability outcomes of TranS-C, with respect to continued (a) activities, (b) benefits, and (c) capacity. Aim 2
will use hierarchical linear modeling to evaluate whether manipulating treatment fit to context predicts
sustainability outcomes. Aim 3 will use structural equation modeling to test possible mediators – specifically,
provider perceptions of fit (i.e., acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility) – of the relation between
manipulated treatment fit and sustainability outcomes. To accomplish these aims, the applicant will receive
training in: (1) sustainability of EBTs, (2) advanced quantitative analysis, (3) mechanistic research design, and
(4) qualitative and mixed methods approaches. The research and training opportunities offered by this
fellowship will be supported by the thriving research environment of University of California, Berkeley and
mentorship from the applicant’s Sponsor (Dr. Allison Harvey) and expert Consultants (Drs. Shannon Wiltsey
Stirman, Cara Lewis, and Sophia Rabe-Hesketh). Collectively, this F32 fellowship will support the applicant’s
career goals of becoming an independent investigator in implementation science with a program of research
that evaluates the predictors, mechanisms, and outcomes of implementation and sustainability of EBTs in
community settings."

The goal of this study is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which long “noncoding” RNAs regulate
mammalian cells differentiation. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), defined as RNAs longer than 200nt without
functional protein coding capacity, are emerging regulators of gene expression. Genomic studies revealed that
many lncRNAs are differentially expressed in a wide variety of biological processes. Although an increasing
number of lncRNAs are observed to play important roles under many physiological and pathological conditions,
the molecular mechanisms they use to control gene expression are still unknown for a lot of lncRNAs. Thus,
mechanistically characterizing functionally important lncRNAs in mammalian cells is of high significance to both
RNA molecular biology and potential usage of these RNAs as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.
Using the terminal differentiation of erythroid cells as a model, our recent studies revealed that lncRNAs can be
classified into bona fide lncRNAs and small-polypeptide-encoding “lncRNAs” based on their functional
association with the cellular translational apparatus, the ribosome. Notably, we observed that lncRNAs from
each of these two categories play critical roles in this important cell differentiation process. Thus, we plan to
mechanistically dissect how bona fide lncRNAs and small-polypeptide-encoding “lncRNAs” regulate gene
expression in mammalian cell differentiation, respectively. The results from this study will not only fill a
fundamental knowledge gap in lncRNA biology, the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs, but also may
potentially provide insights for human diseases, as one of the lncRNAs we will study, Dleu2, is frequently
deleted in certain human leukemias."

Understanding and treating genome abnormalities that lead to rare genetic neurodegenerative diseases such as
Niemann-Pick C1 globally managing cholesterol homeostasis, or APOE alleles impacting cholesterol
homeostasis in the brain triggering late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), present a major challenge from both
basic science and clinical perspectives. We have developed a Gaussian process regression (GPR) based
machine learning (ML) approach that captures for the first time genomic variation in the population to understand
the spatial covariance (SCV) relationships contributing to sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the
individual. Genetic disease is fundamentally a problem of understanding the impact of altered folding
intermediates found in response to variation in the protein fold and how they are managed by proteostasis.
Proteostasis encompasses a broad range of chaperone and degradative components that manage the synthesis,
folding/stability and function of the protein fold in response to inherited and environmental stress and aging. The
general premise of this proposal is to develop a deep genome-based understanding of proteostasis that will
teach us how to manage genetic diseases triggered by folding stress. The rationale for this proposal is that
sparse genetic diversity found in the population, when used as a collective through application of GRP-ML
defined SCV relationships, can provide us on a residue-by-residue basis insight into the folding intermediates
that contribute to disease for the entire polypeptide sequence. The objective of this proposal is to understand
the role of proteostasis in managing this genetic diversity for the benefit of therapeutic intervention. We
hypothesize that management of the polypeptide fold of disease-causing variant proteins found in the population
by targeting the function of the multivalent Hsp40 and Hsp70 co-chaperone/chaperone branch (the Hsp70 axis)
of the proteostasis network will enable precision correction of misfolding phenotypes found in neurodegenerative
disease. Our approach will study the impact of variation in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene. NPC1 is an
inherited, autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol
and other lipids in late endosomal (LE) and lysosome (Ly) compartments of all cell types. The primary effect of
NPC1 variation results in early onset neurodegenerative disease in response to loss of cholesterol homeostasis.
In Aim 1 we will explore the ability of small molecules to allosterically regulate the activity of components of the
Hsp70 axis to retune the synthesis, folding/stability, trafficking and/or function of NPC1 variants. In Aim 2 we
will explore the molecular mechanism of action (MoA) of the Hsp70 axis components that are responsible for
enabling NPC1 variant correction. Completion of both aims will generate a comprehensive assessment of the
role of Hsp70 axis in NPC1 disease progression and will be used as a guide for advancement of a precision
medicine approach to reduce or prevent the onset of neurodegenerative disease triggered by genomic variation
in NPC1 population."

The ultimate goal of this grant is to determine how synapses and circuits function in vivo to control behaviors.
One major focus is to clarify the mechanisms of short-term plasticity, and to understand the functional and
behavioral role of short term plasticity at different synapses. Although synaptic plasticity plays a crucial role
throughout the brain, and dysfunction has been implicated in numerous neurological disorders, the many
interacting forms of plasticity remain poorly understood. We will focus on the hypothesis that specialized
calcium sensors respond to presynaptic calcium signals to enhance neurotransmitter release. Our findings
suggest that facilitation and posttetanic potentiation (PTP) use 2 different types of calcium sensors to enhance
transmission on different time scales. Facilitation is a form of synaptic enhancement that lasts for hundreds of
milliseconds. We have found that facilitation is mediated by synaptotagmin 7 (syt7), which is a calcium-
sensitive isoform with slow kinetics. In preliminary studies we find that in syt7 knockout mice, facilitation is
eliminated even though the initial probability of release and presynaptic calcium signals are unaltered. Viral
expression of syt7 restores facilitation in syt7 knockout animals. These studies indicate that we have identified
the long sought after calcium sensor for facilitation. Future studies will clarify the role of syt7 in facilitation in
contributing to different behaviors. PTP is a form of synaptic enhancement lasting for tens of seconds following
a period of high-frequency firing of presynaptic neurons. We have recently shown that PKCβ is a calcium
sensor for PTP at the calyx of Held. We will continue to clarify the mechanism of PTP and ultimately plan to
use molecular genetics to selectively eliminate PTP from specific synapses to determine the role of PTP in
different behaviors.
A second major focus is to clarify cerebellar circuitry and understand how different circuit elements contribute
to cerebellar function, which regulates motor learning, sensorimotor integration and social behaviors. We have
recently shown that all Purkinje cells (PCs) have collaterals that target many types of cells within the cerebellar
cortex, even in adults. This indicates it is necessary to consider feedback from the output of PCs to the
cerebellar cortex. We will determine if PCPC synapses promote synchronous activity also test the
hypothesis that synaptically-connected PCs converge onto the same DCN neuron and regulate its firing.
These studies will extend our understanding of cerebellar processing and will provide important insights into
neurological disorders that arise from cerebellar dysfunction. We will also determine how specific regions of the
cerebellar cortex regulate specific behaviors."

 Following ocular primary herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infection, the virus replicates in the eye
and establishes latency in the trigeminal ganglia (TG). In a latently infected individual, the virus can
occasionally reactivate and travel back to the eye causing recurrent disease. This reactivation from latency is
the major cause of corneal scarring (CS) in HSV-1 eye infections. We have shown previously that elicitation of
neutralizing antibody alone can protect immunized mice from eye disease and death; however, it does not
protect the immunized mice from virus replication in the eye and the establishment of latency in the TG. We
therefore focused on the mechanisms by which HSV-1 may subvert the ability of the immune system to clear
the virus, limit viral load, and prevent establishment of latency. We have shown that HSV-1 viral ICP22
suppresses the host CD80 co-stimulatory molecule and that this leads to reduced CD8+ CTL activity in the eye
and TG of ocularly infected mice, which in turn leads to less effective and delayed clearance of virus and
increased susceptibility to establishment of latency but at the same time protect host from HSV-1-induced
pathology. Our published and preliminary studies identified immune response regulatory mechanisms that
could be targeted to enhance the vaccine’s ability to reduce HSV-1 replication in the eye and prevent latency-
reactivation. By completing these studies, we expect to identify a novel approach to generating a vaccine with
both prophylactic and therapeutic applications that may control acute and latent infection without adverse
effects. This will be achieved by understanding how ICP22 and CD80 coordinately regulate virus replication in
the eye, eye disease, and latency-reactivation. Collectively, our Specific Aims focus on understanding
mechanisms of immune escape that protect the host from increased pathology while reducing viral clearance.
We propose to: (1) Determine whether blocking binding of ICP22 to the CD80 promoter will increase primary
HSV-1 infection, latency-reactivation, and eye disease in ocularly infected mice; and (2) Determine whether
exacerbation of CS by a recombinant HSV-1 expressing CD80 (HSV-CD80) or by viruses lacking the ICP22
suppressive effect is associated with the presence of PD-L1 but not CD28 or CTLA4.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: HSV-1 infections are among the most frequent serious viral eye infections in the
U.S. and are a major cause of viral-induced blindness. The results generated by this study will potentially
establish a previously undescribed mechanism underlying viral immune evasion that could be exploited to
better manage HSV infection. In light of recent failure of a large-scale phase III HSV-1 vaccine trials, our
approach may help design a more efficacious vaccine."

Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) expressed by T cells recognize tumor cells via single chains antibodies and
activate T cell cytotoxic machinery and costimulation. In clinical studies, costimulation mediated by CD28 and
4-1BB endodomains integrated into the CD19-specific CAR has been shown to be equally effective in causing
tumor regression. However, CD28 and 4-1BB costimulation differentially modulates the kinetic, metabolism
and persistence of CAR-T cells, and the mechanisms governing these differences are not fully understood. In
this study, we have identified that LCK recruited by co-receptors into the synapse of the CAR encoding CD28
leads to antigen-independent CAR-CD3ζ endodomain phosphorylation and imprints T cell activation upon
antigen engagement. In contrast, the synapse formed by the CAR encoding 4-1BB recruits the THEMIS-SHP1
phosphatase complex that attenuates CAR-CD3ζ endodomain phosphorylation and T cell activation. We have
also proved that the CAR synapse can be engineered to tune down the activity of CD28 costimulation or to
tune up the activity of the 4-1BB costimulation. This discovery has been recently published in Cancer Cell.
Remarkably, we observed that LCK mediated constitutive phosphorylation of CAR-CD3ζ in 4-1BB-
costimulated CAR-Ts does not lead to premature exhaustion of CAR-Ts in xenotransplant models. Therefore,
we hypothesize that the LCK-mediated imprinting in 4-1BB costimulated CAR-Ts leads to unique and critical
signaling pathways in CAR-Ts.
Furthermore, in addition to proximal signaling, CARs profoundly affect downstream T cell signaling. We found
that NF-κB activity is influenced by the type of CAR costimulation. Precisely, 4-1BB induces more pronounced
NF-κB activity than CD28 in CAR-Ts. NF-κB hyperactivity in 4-1BB is not caused by NF-κB overexpression,
but rather by reduced A20 activity. Therefore, we hypothesize that 4-1BB sequesters A20 reducing its
inhibitory effects on NF-κB. Furthermore, since NF-κB/A20 interplay is critical in controlling T cell function at
multiple levels, we hypothesize that regulating NF-κB/A20 may enhance efficacy, persistence and safety of
CAR-Ts. We will develop two specific aims:
Aim 1: To mechanistically assess how LCK-mediated imprinting of 4-1BB costimulated CAR-Ts promotes rapid
antitumor activity without causing T cell exhaustion. We will assess whether LCK overexpression in the 4-1BB
CAR activates unique phosphorylation, transcriptome and metabolic pathways.
Aim 2: To mechanistically assess how 4-1BB affect and how the NF-κB/A20 interplay can be manipulated to
modulate CAR-T cell functions. Since A20/NF-κB interplay is differentially regulated in 4-1BB vs. CD28
costimulated CAR-Ts, we propose to understand how this interplay functions and to develop pharmacologic
and genetic interventions to transiently or permanently modulate NF-κB activity to enhance safety, persistence
and efficacy of CAR-Ts."
10749888,"Astrocytes contribute to many facets of ‘normal’ central nervous system (CNS) physiology, including regulation
of neurotransmitters and K+ ions concentration, synaptic development, and synapse stabilization. These
functions are largely mediated at distal, fine, peripheral astrocyte processes (PAPs). It is at these processes that
astrocytes communicate with their neighbors, regulate ion and neurotransmitter levels and contribute to synapse
development and stabilization. Despite decades of research indicating astrocytes enwrap or contact excitatory
and inhibitory synaptic elements, with increased coverage of mature synapses, there is little known regarding
signals that recruit astrocyte PAPs to synaptic structures. RNA sequencing data we have generated (and
confirmed using multiple public resources) indicate astrocytes express very high levels of the BDNF receptor,
TrkB. Isoform specific identification demonstrates astrocytes predominately express the truncated form, TrkB.T1.
In cortex, TrkB.T1 is found almost exclusively in astrocytes. Global and astrocyte specific genetic deletion of
TrkB.T1 results in astrocytes with significantly reduced volume and branching complexities. Astrocytes lacking
TrkB.T1 show dysregulated expression of both perisynaptic genes associated with mature astrocyte function
and pro-synaptogenic genes. In vitro and in vivo we observed that TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes do not support normal
excitatory synaptogenesis or function as assessed by evaluation of pre and post synaptic excitatory elements
and neuronal mEPSC analysis. Preliminary in vitro data also indicate that TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes fail to enwrap
glutamatergic synapses, a phenotype we readily observe in WT astrocytes. In the current proposal we test the
hypothesis that BDNF signaling through the astrocytic TrkB.T1 receptor serves as a key signaling pathway in
recruiting astrocyte perisynaptic processes to glutamatergic synapses thus facilitating actin mediated structural
plasticity. In the current work we use ultrastructural imaging in WT and astrocyte specific TrkB.T1 KO mice to
determine if BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling in astrocytes is necessary for astrocyte structural plasticity and function at
glutamatergic synapses (Aim 1). We evaluate the loss of astrocyte TrkB.T1 on neuronal synapse development
and function (Aim 2) and we use a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to identify the key signaling
mechanisms by which BDNF binding to astrocyte TrkB.T1 receptors engage downstream signaling mechanisms,
providing a molecular mechanistic framework linking astrocyte BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling to actin cytoskeletal
reorganization, morphological refinement, process outgrowth and synapse enwrapment. These studies identify
a completely novel signaling pathway in astrocyte structural plasticity and have the potential to significantly
advance our understanding of astrocyte-synapse interactions. While disrupted BDNF/TrkB signaling is
implicated in many CNS disorders the relevance of BDNF/astrocytic TrkB.T1 signaling has not been considered."
10746398,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Modern biomedical research is increasingly quantitative. The next generation of researchers will need an
entirely new set of quantitative skills to fully take advantage of the data they create. In response to this need,
the goal of the current R25 proposal is to transform an existing, 5-day bioinformatics techniques course into a
new, two-week short course, Reproducible and FAIR Bioinformatics Analysis of Omics Data, to provide a
unique educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core
competencies in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large datasets. The new course will also address
NIH priorities including rigor and reproducibility and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)
data principles. During the last five years, the Dartmouth faculty who are serving as Principal Investigators
have taught a 5-day course at the MDI Biological Laboratory on bioinformatics and biostatistics to ~40
trainees/year (202 total). Based on overwhelmingly positive feedback, the current project will extend this 5-day
course into a longer, two-week short course at the MDI Biological Laboratory that will feature a low student-to-
instructor ratio (5:1), more hands-on experiential learning, and exceptional faculty who are highly experienced
in teaching and performing big-data analyses. The new course is designed to accommodate ~35 trainees per
year (175 total over the five-year R25 project). It will incorporate modules on biostatistics, scientific rigor and
reproducibility, and FAIR data principles. The course design will also involve a short conceptual presentation,
followed by an exercise in which students will gain confidence by applying a new skill. Each active-learning
session will have three levels of difficulty (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) to allow each student to
progress at their own pace. The low student-to-faculty ratio will allow course facilitators to guide participants
through realistic challenges without causing frustration. The specific aims of the proposed course include:
Specific Aim 1. Develop a two-week short course primarily for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students that
improves their ability to design and analyze omics experiments such as RNA-seq, 16S (microbiome),
metagenomics, and sc-RNA-seq data; Specific Aim 2. Enhance the impact of research by biomedical
scientists by teaching them the Responsible Conduct of Research, the secure and ethical use of data, as well
as rigor and reproducibility and FAIR data principles; Specific Aim 3. Disseminate the training curriculum to a
broad audience; and Specific Aim 4. Evaluate the short- and long-term impacts of the course on students,
including a long-term follow-up to determine students’ confidence in and actual integration of bioinformatics,
biostatistics, and FAIR data principles into their research, and the reported impact of this course on their career
trajectory and competitiveness in the job market. In summary, the proposed course will provide a unique cross-
training, educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core
competency in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large data sets."

Type 2 diabetes continues to spread globally due to unhealthy environment interacting with genetics. Recent genetic
discoveries of >700 variants at >400 loci associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its related quantitative traits (QTs:
fasting glucose (FG), insulin (FI) and hemoglobin A1c (A1c)) give insight into new T2D pathobiology. However, most
discoveries have been in whites; studies in minority groups disproportionately affected by T2D are needed. Also, most
associations are in the non-coding genome, indicating that whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis is needed for full
variant and effector gene characterization. The NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) study includes
WGS from 21,493 cases of prevalent T2D and 63,541 controls from five populations (41,557 Euro, 23,203 AA, 16,213
Latino, 2,867 Asian, 1,194 Samoan Adiposity Study) from 28 cohorts and up to 54,407 non-T2D individuals with FG,
FI or HbA1c, as well as age of T2D onset, level of glycemic control and longitudinal follow-up for incident T2D
events. In this project Aim 1 is to test WGS-wide in five ancestry groups for known and new common and rare variants
associated T2D and QTs. We will conduct analyses in the NHLBI BioData Catalyst. Replication of novel variants is
available in >1 million individuals of diverse ancestry from six biobanks with T2D (UKBB, BioME, BioVU, Partners
BB, REGARDS, MVP) with TOPMed-imputed genomic array data. For health translation, we will group T2D genetic
risk variants into polygenic risk scores (PRSs) that predict future T2D or characterize specific physiological axes, and
use variants in Mendelian Randomization (MR) tests of disease causality. Next, TOPMed has blood omic measures
from five ancestry groups that may also identify novel biological networks relevant to T2D pathobiology, including
whole blood DNA methylation (measured by sequencing or microarrays, N=11,131), transcriptomics (RNA-seq)
(N=8,334), proteomics (SomaLogic aptamers or Olink proteomics, N=7,897) and metabolomics (liquid
chromatography/mass spectroscopy, N=11,631). In Aim 2, we will test omic signatures associated with T2D and QTs
individually and in multidimensional omic and genomic network models of the pathobiology of T2D. Finally, in Aim 3
we plan to integrate TOPMed WGS and omic results with bespoke cell or tissue-specific (beta cell, islet, liver, fat and
muscle) omic and epigenomic annotation (ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Hi-C, ChIP-seq) in the Accelerating Medicine
Partnership (AMP) T2D Diabetes epiGenome Atlas, and with hundreds of additional genomic trait associations in the
AMP T2D Knowledge Portal (T2DKP) for ‘in silico variant-to-function’ and phenomic studies. Complete functional
mapping with blood and tissue-specific omic integration of the human T2D and QT genome is on the horizon. Our
multidisciplinary, multicenter team has a proven track record in genetics and omic discovery. We are actively working
with TOPMed, AMP T2D DGA and T2DKP data. We are well positioned to achieve the Aims of the proposal, with the
intention to find new approaches to address the global epidemic of T2D in all populations at risk."
10830908,"Background: Since initiation of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program nearly 30 years ago, VA
has been at the forefront of surgical quality measurement and improvement. Much of this work has been
focused on assessing risk-adjusted postoperative complications, with less attention paid to important care
processes, and even less attention to evaluating and improving quality across the full continuum of surgical
care, including the presurgical period. The importance of adapting current and new measures to reliably and
accurately assess the full continuum of surgical care will increase as greater numbers of Veterans use VA-
purchased Community Care (CC). While one out of three VA patients receive CC, quality assessment is far
less developed for CC than for those receiving care within the VA.
Significance: With the focus of quality assessment being on postoperative outcomes and complications,
quality of care across the entire surgical continuum is largely ignored, especially issues of timeliness, overuse,
and underuse in the presurgical period. Defined episodes of care, which constitute a set of services provided to
treat a clinical condition, have been promoted to assess quality, coordination, and cost among providers
involved in a patient’s care. Although episode models have not been used by VA to monitor quality, VA has the
opportunity to use a surgical episode framework to measure surgical quality more broadly, understand the
value of this approach, and inform future quality reporting needs for VA-delivered and VA-purchased CC. The
importance of examining surgical episode quality is even more salient given the rapid increase in VA-
purchased CC, with an inevitable need to ensure that quality is maintained across all settings.
Innovation and Impact: The goal of this proposal is to develop an innovative model to measure condition-
specific surgical episode quality, including pre-, peri-, and postoperative care phases, for 3 common
procedures of varying complexity. This work will advance the science of quality measurement through
assessment across the entire surgical continuum. In applying this model to existing VA and CC data, we will
identify new opportunities for surgical quality improvement in VA medical centers and will facilitate a condition-
specific comparison of episode quality differences between VA and CC settings. We will also identify limitations
in episode quality assessment for CC relative to VA using existing CC data sources.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Define condition-specific quality measures for surgical episode quality evaluation. Aim
2: Measure the performance gap and reliability of episode-based quality measures across VA medical centers.
Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of applying episode-based quality measurement in the CC setting.
Methodology: Aim 1: We will identify new quality measures in response to identified episode measurement
gaps. A Delphi panel will rate the newly proposed quality measures for face validity, importance, and feasibility
for inclusion in the surgical episode quality measurement model. Aim 2: We will apply the episode quality
measurement model (defined in Aim 1) to VA national data to assess facility-level variation in episode quality
and measure the reliability of the model to profile VA facility performance. Aim 3: Using quality measures
applicable to both VA and CC administrative data sources, we will compare episode quality in VA and CC
settings within similar healthcare markets, identifying limitations in applying the episode quality measurement
model to existing CC data for meaningful VA and CC quality comparisons.
Next Steps/Implementation: We will use the findings of this research to work with partners to refine and
expand the measurement model to other surgical conditions to improve care quality for Veterans more broadly,
identify targets for cooperative quality improvement within VA and CC settings, and provide recommendations
for improvement of episode quality measurement for CC. This work can also be used by partners to inform
Veteran choices and will assist VA leaders to inform “make versus buy” policy decisions."
10707108,"Evidence-based psychotherapies (EBP) are the most effective treatments for posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD; APA, 2017; VA/DoD, 2017) and yet remain significantly underutilized (Hundt et al., 2017;
Kehle-Forbes et al., 2016). Patient level barriers to EBP use including patient knowledge about EBPs, stigma,
and concerns about treatment effectiveness or treatment demands (e.g., Hundt et al., 2015). Interventions that
increase the rate of EBP initiation in Veterans with PTSD can substantially improve symptom burden,
functioning, and quality of life (APA, 2017). Direct to consumer (DTC) marketing strategies, in which a service
or product is advertised directly to the end user rather than a health care provider, are frequently used and
highly effective at driving demand for psychotropic medications (e.g., Avery et al., 2012; Woloshin et al., 2001).
DTC marketing may be particularly effective for EBPs because advertisements can directly target some of the
primary barriers to EBP use.
 However, the limited existing studies on DTC marketing for mental health have focused on patient-
reported intentions to engage in treatment, rather than actual therapy-seeking behaviors (e.g., Brecht et al.,
2017; Gallo et al., 2013). Second, no studies have systematically compared different DTC marketing
messages. This is an important omission because not all message types work for all products and for all
consumers (Belch & Belch, 2017; Ogivy, 1985). Third, most prior studies of DTC advertising for psychotherapy
have presented their messaging to the general population, rather than selecting for participants who need
psychotherapy, which limits the applicability of their conclusions to target populations, and no studies have
specifically focused on Veterans or those with PTSD.
 Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) and Veteran and provider stakeholder
feedback, the current study proposes to develop and test different versions of DTC advertising messages
aimed at increasing engagement in EBPs for PTSD. Although VA has invested considerable resources in
advertising campaigns for mental health, PTSD education and outreach materials, no research has examined
which strategies would be most effective at increasing Veteran initiation of psychotherapy. Having this
information would help VA focus its limited financial resources on the most effective DTC advertising strategies
and messages, which has the potential to engage more Veterans in the most effective treatments and reduce
the burden of untreated PTSD (e.g., Zatzick et al., 1997; 2008; Kessler, 2000). This proposal aligns with the
2019 VA priorities emphasizing research on high priority mental health conditions, such as PTSD, and
increasing return on investment in EBP training and increasing efficiency by facilitating uptake of the most
effective treatments for PTSD.
 In pilot work, Veterans, family members, providers, and Veterans’ Service Organization members
provided feedback on which DTC advertising strategies would be most compelling to them. Based upon these
early qualitative insights, preliminary work, input from national partners, and our theoretical model, we have
selected advertising strategies that qualified for further testing on a larger scale. These include the testimonial
strategy, the utility strategy, and the compare/contrast strategy. In the course of the proposed study, we will
develop brief advertising videos with iterative feedback from Veteran, family member, and provider
stakeholders and test the effectiveness of these DTC advertisements in a RCT with Veterans who screened
positive for PTSD but are not currently in psychotherapy. Primary outcomes will include Veteran attitudes
about psychotherapy, intention to seek psychotherapy, and initiation of a referral for psychotherapy. The
results of this study will provide invaluable information to help VA target its limited advertising and outreach
budget to the most effective strategies and messages for Veterans."

Many long-term survivors of cancer experience progressive chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI,
commonly referred to as ""chemobrain""). Importantly, no strategies exist to prevent/reverse CICI.
Chemotherapeutics do not cross the blood brain barrier and mature neurons are resistant to chemotherapeutic
agents. In contrast, endothelial cells are exposed to the highest concentrations of these drugs and are highly
sensitive to their effects. We discovered that chemotherapeutic drugs, including paclitaxel (PTX) induce
cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells to undergo cellular senescence, a common DNA damage response.
Endothelial cells play critical roles in regulation of basal CBF, moment-to-moment adjustment of CBF to neuronal
activity via neurovascular coupling (NVC) and maintenance of the microcirculatory network. Each of these
endothelial functions are critical for healthy brain function. The central hypothesis of this application is that
chemotherapeutic agents induce endothelial senescence, which impairs cerebral blood flow, promote
microvascular rarefaction and compromise endothelium-dependent neurovascular coupling responses and
barrier integrity contributing to CICI. This hypothesis will be tested using an innovative mouse model: cancer-
free senescence reporter mice treated with the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (PTX), which allows the
detection and selective elimination of senescent cells. Specific Aims: 1) Deter’mine how chemotherapy-induced
endothelial sen’escence alters neurovascular coup’ling resp’onses and CBF. We postulate that chemotherapy
induces senescence in endothelial cells, which impairs endothelial vasodilator function, compromises
endothelium-dependent NVC responses and decreases capillary density, dysregulating CBF. Our prediction,
based on this hypoth’esis, is that elimination of senesc’ent endothelial cells, through genetic manipulation or through
translatable senolytic therapies w’ill restore neurovascular fun’ction and improve CBF in mice treated with clinically
relevant PTX protocol. 2) Deter’mine how chemotherapy-induced endothelial sen’escence impacts microvascular
density. We postulate that chemotherapy -induced endothelial senescence compromises the maintenance of the
microcirculatory network and/or impairs endothelial barrier function and that elimination of senesc’ent cells w’ill
increase cerebromicrovascular density and restore barrier function, attenuating neuroinflammation. 3) Deter’mine how
chemotherapy-induced endothelial sen’escence impacts cognitive function. We postulate that PTX-induced
microvascular dysfunction contribute to the impairment of multiple domains of cognition and that elimination of
senescent cells will prevent/delay the development of CICI. Our expected outcomes will generate an integrated
understanding of the mechanisms that underlie microvascular dysfunction after chemotherapy and establish
endothelial senescence as a translationally relevant target for prevention of CICI."

The aggregate failure of pre-clinical and clinical trials in AD has demonstrated that an improved fundamental
understanding of memory and how the molecular components of memory are altered in the AD disease
process is necessary to develop effective treatment. The broad objective of the project is to identify the
biochemical substrates of long-lasting memories in mammals. The current proposal focuses on a family of
RNA-binding, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB), that stabilizes memory in
invertebrates and mice. Remarkably, CPEB family protein forms non-disease-causing amyloidogenic
aggregates and aggregation of CPEB is necessary to stabilize memory. As amyloids are typically linked to
disease states, the question remains how similarly structured Aβ42 or Tau proteins can have opposing effects
on memory. Therefore, to develop a better understanding of the relationship between amyloids that support
memory and amyloids that disrupt memory, we will use a variety of techniques to solve the structure and
function of the CPEB family members, CPEB2 and CPEB3, in human and mice. In Aim 1, we will use cryo-
electron microscopy to solve the structure of CPEB aggregates from fresh human frontotemporal lobe tissue
collected from 25-50-year-old human subjects undergoing tissue removal under the standard of care for their
disease. These tissues would have been otherwise discarded. In Aim 2, mice lacking the ability to form
aggregates of CPEB2 and CPEB3 will be trained and tested in a one-trial inhibitory avoidance task to assay
their ability to form, maintain, and recall memory. In Aim 2 we will also investigate the consequence of CPEB2
and CPEB3 aggregation in translation of mRNA encoding synaptic proteins. The results would be the first to
provide direct structural analysis of a functional amyloid linked to memory in mammals, the structural
distinctions, if any, between functional and toxic amyloid in the human brain, and precisely link CPEB2 and
CPEB3 aggregation and activity to animals’ ability to form or stabilize memory. This knowledge would provide
the foundation to investigate in the future how toxic amyloids of Aβ42 or Tau specifically perturb memory."
10765617,"Abstract
Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplant (TPIAT) is performed to treat the severe, intractable pain of
chronic pancreatitis for patients who have failed medical or endoscopic therapies. The TP relieves the source
of pain, while the IAT reduces risk or severity of post-operative diabetes; after 1 year, up to 40% of patients are
off insulin and nearly 90% have islet function (C-peptide positive). However, little is known about the long-term
function of the islet graft. Rigorous studies are needed to determine what proportion of patients maintain islet
function long term and whether islet function improves glycemic control and reduces diabetes complications in
this population. This carries high potential for impact in clinical care: currently some patients are denied
coverage for IAT due to lack of rigorous studies establishing the benefit of IAT. Furthermore, we know little
about how changes in gut anatomy and associated hormones (GLP-1) and alpha cell dysregulation (glucagon)
of intraportally transplanted islets impact long-term glycemic regulation. Hypoglycemia has been increasingly
reported after TPIAT, with exaggerated incretin response and/or defective glucagon counterregulation
suggested as possible mechanisms.
We propose to study islet function, glycemic control, diabetes complications, and mechanisms impacting
glycemic control (incretin hormone axis, counterregulatory hormones) in patients who are 5-20 years out from
TPIAT. The study’s overall aim is to determine the long-term benefit of IAT. To assess islet graft function, we
will use C-peptide levels from mixed meal tolerance testing (MMTT) as the marker of endogenous islet
function. We will enroll at least 200 participants in this cross-sectional study, who are 5-20 years after TPIAT
for chronic or recurrent acute pancreatitis. The study's first aim is to determine the proportion of patients who
maintain islet graft function 5-20 years after TPIAT and to determine whether C-peptide levels from a MMTT
are associated with concurrent glycemic control measures. The second aim is to determine whether islet graft
function is inversely associated with diabetes-specific complications (severe hypoglycemia, diabetic
ketoacidosis, and micro- or macrovascular disease). The third aim is to determine other mechanisms that
impact long-term glycemic control in TPIAT, including incretin function, alpha cell function, and markers of beta
cell stress. As an exploratory aim we will recruit a subgroup of patients who are 5-20 years out from TP alone
to undergo the same testing protocol for comparison with TPIAT recipients without and with graft function. This
study's significance lies in its potential to directly impact clinical care and access to IAT when TP is needed.
We hypothesize that islet graft function improves glycemic control and reduces diabetes complications even in
recipients who are not insulin-independent, but that dysfunctional incretin and counter-regulatory responses
will impact hypoglycemia risk."
10721822,"Research: The current standard of care for physical rehabilitation of Veterans hospitalized for heart failure
(HF) is inadequate for 3 reasons: 1) When prescribed, Veterans may fail to engage in physical rehabilitation
due to feeling overwhelmed by their overall high treatment workload, 2) Home physical therapy is often under-
dosed and therefore fails to achieve clinical impact, and 3) Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is rarely prescribed.
When it is utilized, its focus on moderate intensity aerobic exercise is inappropriate for severely debilitated
Veterans hospitalized for HF. I am the Principal Investigator of an NIA-funded pilot study (R03AG064371)
(BAMS-HF [Balance, Aerobic capacity, Mobility and Strength in HF] study), which provides older Veterans
recently hospitalized for HF with a novel, rigorous 1:1 physical therapist-led home-based rehabilitation
intervention that is designed to address #2 and #3 above. Although Veterans who complete the study are
enthusiastic about it, they do desire contact with other BAMS-HF Veterans and [report low motivation as a
significant barrier to participation.] These insights and challenges from the BAMS-HF study led to the current
proposal of the Capacity cOaching And exerCise after Hospitalization for Heart Failure (COACH-HF)
intervention. Based on the preliminary results of the BAMS-HF pilot study and existing literature, COACH-HF
will take a 2-pronged approach to physical rehabilitation in Veterans recently hospitalized for HF: 1) Capacity
Coaching from a Peer Support Specialist (a Veteran with HF), and 2) Physical therapist-led rigorous, in-home
strength, balance and mobility exercise protocol that will occur 3 days/week for a maximum of 12 weeks, and
monthly group exercise sessions with the physical therapist and other COACH-HF Veterans until 6 months.
[Modification of the proposed COACH-HF intervention] and pilot testing will occur over the following 2 Aims:
 [Aim 1: Garner stakeholder feedback on the structure and delivery of the COACH-HF intervention using [12]
focus groups (FGs) among 3 stakeholder categories: Veterans recently hospitalized for HF, Veterans’
caregivers, and healthcare providers. Differing perspectives from the FGs will be addressed with a small
decision-making group of investigators and stakeholders. Using nominal group technique (NGT), the decision-
making group will brainstorm and rank ideas for addressing key areas of disagreement. The intervention
design will be modified by the PI based on the FG and NGT results. All FGs participants will be invited to give
feedback on the final intervention design prior to moving forward to pilot testing (i.e. member-checking).]
 [Aim 2: Determine whether Capacity Coaching increases adherence to the rehabilitation intervention by
randomizing 25 Veterans ≥ 55 years recently hospitalized for HF 1:1 to Capacity Coaching + Rehabilitation
intervention (CC+Rehab) vs. Rehabilitation only (Rehab Only). Assess the feasibility and acceptability of
rehabilitation intervention (both arms) and Capacity Coaching (CC+Rehab arm).]
Candidate: I am an advanced HF trained cardiologist with an interest in physical rehabilitation for Veterans
hospitalized for HF. I am co-director of the clinical CR and HF programs at the Rocky Mountain Regional
(RMR) VAMC. My career goal is to become an independent VA rehabilitation researcher specializing in
physical rehabilitation of Veterans hospitalized for HF. This award will help me develop the skills in qualitative
research, stakeholder engagement and clinical trial design for behavioral interventions that are necessary to
achieve my career goals. The next step is to write a Merit Review application that proposes testing the efficacy
of the COACH-HF intervention.
Environment: This research will be conducted at the Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center (RMR

Childhood anxiety and depression are common, impairing, and have the potential to disrupt development well
into adulthood. Pediatricians need mental health screening tools to meet the prevalence of these internalizing
disorders early in childhood. We have developed a promising digital health approach for detecting movement
and speech phenotypes of internalizing disorders in young children. My long-term goal is to create a novel
technology for screening young children for internalizing disorders at scale. My short term objective is to
leverage my original approach and my proposed training curriculum to create a prototype mobile health
(mHealth) application that provides a composite digital phenotype to detect childhood internalizing disorders.
My specific aims are to (1) evaluate the validity of digital phenotypes measured by a novel mHealth system for
identifying internalizing disorders in young children and (2) develop a composite digital phenotype for
childhood internalizing disorders involving multiple constructs from the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) and
identify moderating RDoC construct variables. If successful, these mHealth enabled digital phenotypes may be
used to further NIMH health initiatives of enabling better tracking of changes in internalizing mental health
status across childhood and supporting new and innovative research-practice partnerships with pediatrics to
improve dissemination of evidence-based mental health screening. Similarly, this approach answers a need
identified by the American Academic of Pediatrics for new tools that screen for behavioral and emotional
problems. Seventy children between the ages of 4 and 8 years, oversampled for internalizing disorders, will be
recruited for this study from pediatric and childhood mental health services at a university-based regional
medical center that services the state of Vermont and upstate New York. They will be administered mood
induction tasks design to press for RDoC Negative and Positive Valence constructs, while instrumented with a
belt-worn smartphone enabled with the prototype mHealth application. A composite digital phenotype will be
developed across constructs based on statistical classification models trained using machine learning on data
captured during the tasks. To carry out this work as an independent investigator, I propose an intensive training
curriculum to gain foundational skills in digital phenotyping. It includes training in (1) developmental
epidemiology to better research early childhood psychopathology through a public health lens, and (2a) mobile
app development to communicate effectively with app developers (2b) analysis of complex systems including
machine learning approaches, (2c) ethical and societal issues regarding digital psychiatry. Completion of these
training and research aims will provide me the skills and evidence to develop an easily administered digital
health technology for identifying young children with internalizing disorders in the short-term, and in the long term, the ability to successfully contribute to the emerging field of digital health for the purpose of improving
childhood mental health."
10766695,"Alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) is an essential nutrient and the major fat-soluble antioxidant in humans. The most critical health-promoting action of vitamin E is thought to be anchored in protecting the central nervous system (CNS) from damage to membranes, proteins and nucleic acids induced by reactive species or free radicals. The levels and distribution of vitamin E in the body are regulated by hepatic alpha tocopherol transfer protein (TTP), which regulates secretion of the vitamin from the liver to circulating lipoproteins, and in turn to all tissues. Accordingly, mutations in the TTPA gene are the only known cause for ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED; OMIM 277460). Our studies over the years have identified critical functions and mechanisms of action of a-tocopherol and TTP and we have made important discoveries that detail how TTP transports the vitamin across cells in the liver and the cerebellum. The proposed research will focus on three areas of critical importance: 1) we will decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying TTP-facilitation of trafficking of a- tocopherol from the endocytic compartment to the plasma membrane. 2) We will examine the molecular mechanisms and physiological consequences of novel, antioxidant independent activities of vitamin E, and their consequences on neurological health in a mouse model of vitamin E deficiency. 3) We will decipher the mechanisms by which vitamin E prevents the pathological progression of non alcoholic fatty liver disease to severe, irreversible liver disease (non alcoholic steatohepatitis). The results from our studies will provide important new insight into the role of vitamin E in health and disease."

Accurate repair of DNA damage is critical for genetic stability, and for preventing aging-related degeneration
and cancer. We are working to identify key factors that regulate accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs) through the error-free homologous recombination (HR) pathway. DSBs can arise from many sources
including endogenous replication fork damage, exogenous environmental toxicants, or oxidative stresses
induced by endogenous sources and during pro-inflammatory responses to toxicant injury. We found that the
RAD51 paralogs are critical for promoting HR and hence for suppressing error-prone repair mechanisms. Over
300 studies link mutations in human RAD51 paralogs with cancer, and women with breast or ovarian cancer
are now screened for RAD51 paralog mutations. However, it remains largely unknown which RAD51 paralog
mutations are pathogenic and how these mutations sensitize individuals to environmentally induced-DNA
damage due to our lack of functional analysis of either the wild-type or mutated proteins. We do not know how
these proteins are recruited, their functional components, or the disruptions caused by mutations or
polymorphisms in the RAD51 paralogs. This knowledge gap results from low abundance of endogenous
RAD51 paralog proteins, insolubility of the recombinant proteins, as well as embryonic lethality in knock-out
mice. We are therefore using genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to characterize RAD51
paralog function upon exposure to DSB inducing agents. We will use ionizing radiation (IR) and bleomycin as
model agents for environmentally relevant DSB-inducing agents. Using complementary approaches in
combination with high-throughput genetic screening, we are now uniquely poised to address how RAD51
paralog mutations predispose individuals to human cancer and thus, to identify opportunities for determining
who is at risk for cancer development upon exposure to environmental carcinogens. Our ultimate goal is to
enable development of precision medicine strategies for individual patients whose tumors harbor a RAD51
paralog mutation profile."

Community-based Design and Evaluation of A Conversational Agent to Promote SARS-
COV2 Vaccination in Black Churches
African Americans have suffered a disproportionate burden from COVID-19, with significantly
higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality compared to Whites. These findings may
be compounded by the fact that African Americans are also at higher risk for vaccine hesitancy.
As limited health literacy has been identified as a key mediator of racial and ethnic disparities,
interventions that address health literacy barriers have the potential to ameliorate these
disparities. Over the past decade we have developed and tested embodied conversational agents
(ECA) — computer characters that simulate face-to-face counseling using voice, hand gesture,
gaze cues and other nonverbal behavior, and successfully used them in health behavior
interventions for populations with low health literacy. We have developed ECA-based
interventions to address a wide range of health problems among low literacy populations,
including physical activity, diet, and medication adherence promotion, providing access to and
explanation of healthcare documents, and collection of family health histories. In this project, we
propose to create an effective and sustainable smartphone-based ECA intervention designed to
deliver personalized and tailored education about SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza vaccination. We
will collaborate with the Black Ministerial Alliance TenPoint (BMATP) of Greater Boston to develop
the intervention app and evaluate it in a clinical trial involving 600 congregants from 12
predominately African American churches. Our primary hypothesis is that participants will have
significantly greater SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza vaccination series completion at 6 months (H1)
and 12 months (H2) in versions of the app that promote engagement and incorporate spiritual
tailoring. Our secondary hypotheses are that, among participants who have not been vaccinated,
those in the high engagement and tailored conditions will have significant improvements in intent
to obtain SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza vaccination and attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 and
Influenza vaccination."
10756924,"In the United States in 2017, most of the 135,000 people diagnosed with colorectal cancer received oxaliplatin
to treat stage II-IV disease. About 70% of patients develop oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN)
that is characterized by upper and lower extremity numbness (N) and tingling (T), which can persist for years.
Painful OIPN develops after N and T in 30% of patients. OIPN (N, T, and pain) poses a major health risk
because it is associated with impaired function, falls, depression, impaired sleep, poor quality of life, and is a
common reason for chemotherapy dose reductions. A critical gap in our scientific knowledge is that no known
preventive interventions for OIPN exist. To address this gap, our overall objective is to test whether duloxetine
prevents oxaliplatin-induced N, T, and pain, using a sequential Phase II to Phase III design that will be
conducted via the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), a large,
multisite research network with access to diverse patient populations. Duloxetine will be tested in this study
based on evidence of its efficacy for established OIPN from two clinical trials (Yang et al, 2012; Smith et al.,
2013), and our pre-clinical data showing that duloxetine prevents painful OIPN in rats. We will first conduct a
randomized, 3-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-comparative, multi-center study (N = 171) to screen
two daily doses of duloxetine—30 mg and 60 mg—to prevent OIPN (N, T, and pain). If duloxetine is shown to
be clinically active in the Phase II study, we will proceed to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multi-center Phase III study to compare what appears to be the most promising duloxetine dose to placebo. To
maximize the use of patient resources, the Phase II data from patients who either completed treatment with
placebo (n = 54) or the most promising duloxetine dose (n = 54) will be pooled with data obtained from new
Phase III trial accruals to the placebo (n = 70) and most promising duloxetine dose arms (n = 70), respectively
(N = 248). We will use pre-established stopping rules to determine the optimal dose based on the proportions
of patients who do not develop N, T, and pain, and adverse event severity. The two primary hypotheses in the
Phase III study are that the most promising duloxetine dose will be more effective than placebo to prevent 1) N,
T, & pain during oxaliplatin treatment and 2) chronic neuropathic pain one month after treatment. The temporal
patterns of OIPN and functional impairment will be assessed for 18 months after oxaliplatin treatment. This
study addresses the NCI Cancer Moonshot goal to minimize cancer treatment-associated debilitating side
effects, and the priority recommendation outlined in the Institute of Medicine's Relieving Pain in America report
regarding the need for non-opioid treatments for chronic pain. By addressing these priorities, we expect to
make a major advancement in the field of symptom prevention, including pain, by identifying a well-tolerated,
widely available, non-opioid, preventive intervention for a distressing and debilitating chemotherapy side effect
experienced by millions of cancer survivors, for which no good treatment exists."
10765613,"Age-related decline in central auditory function significantly affects quality of life in the elderly, with impaired speech perception leading to increased risk for depression, social isolation and cognitive decline. A 2017 Lancet Commission report cites hearing loss as the largest modifiable risk factor for developing cognitive decline, exceeding smoking, high blood pressure, lack of exercise and social isolation. Remarkably, a 2019 large-scale study found that even mild hearing loss, i.e., still within the normal range, produced an even closer association with cognitive decline. Currently, there is no effective therapy for age-related central auditory decline—hearing aids only address audibility—and no drug treatment. Ideally, a combination of drug treatment with hearing aids and behavioral training could restore auditory function, but the development of pharmacological treatments requires a better understanding of the mechanisms by which candidate drugs improve hearing. The goals of this proposal are to develop biomarkers of altered auditory processing in aging mice and humans, and using these biomarkers, to test the hypothesis that nicotine can normalize these age-related central auditory deficits. Because nicotine enhances cortical and cognitive function, pharmaceutical companies are developing nicotine-like drugs to target cognitive deficits in aging. These drugs are non-addictive (unlike nicotine in tobacco), yet nicotine also is non-addictive when given topically or orally. However, its clinical benefits have not been exploited except as an aid to stop smoking. We hypothesize that: 1) acute nicotine compensates for the age-related decline in inhibition by exciting the remaining inhibitory neurons; 2) chronic nicotine exposure (CNE) upregulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs); and, as a result, 3) acute nicotine and/or CNE will reduce or reverse the age-related auditory decline. We will test these hypotheses in both mouse and human at the level of cells (mouse in vitro brain slice), neural systems (mouse in vivo physiology; human brain imaging and EEG) and behavior (human psychoacoustics). Aim 1 will determine in mouse whether age-related decline in auditory spectrotemporal processing is reversed by acute nicotine or CNE, and characterize the associated cellular mechanisms. Aim 2 will identify, in humans, age-related changes in receptive field properties in auditory cortex using novel fMRI techniques and determine if nicotine reverses these changes using psychoacoustics, fMRI and EEG. This project features a multifaceted, parallel approach in mouse and human. Each Aim will: 1) examine auditory processing at multiple adult ages; 2) use similar acoustic stimuli in both species, accounting for species differences in hearing, to target common mechanisms; 3) test the effects of nicotine. A successful outcome will promote an integrated understanding across levels, from cellular mechanisms to perception, and facilitate translation of nicotine-based therapeutic treatments to clinical populations."

Functional genomic analyses of the developing human brain have revealed highly dynamic spatiotemporal
patterns of gene expression and epigenetic changes during prenatal and early postnatal development and across
brain regions. Disruptions of these developmentally dynamic processes have been implicated by numerous
complementary analyses in the etiology of multiple neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.
Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), along with splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) and structural variant
quantitative trait loci (svQTLs), are genomic variants that differ between individuals, with these differences
correlating with functional changes to gene expression or splicing behavior. Many of these QTLs show specificity
to tissues, brain regions, developmental stages, or cell types, and a proportion overlap with known genetic risk
factors of human disorders. Here, we propose to pursue three integrated Aims, including whole-genome
sequencing and both bulk tissue and single-nuclei RNA sequencing, to identify genomic variants,
eQTL/sQTL/svQTLs, and patterns of gene expression and co-expression in two regions of the human brain
across mid-fetal development through to adolescence. In addition, we will apply novel and newly developed
computational tools to associate these QTLs with specific cell types and loci or genes implicated in
neuropsychiatric disorders. By so doing we will augment, and dramatically expand upon, earlier efforts to
understand QTLs and their roles in neural development, function, and neuropsychiatric disorders."
10755307,"Project Summary/ Abstract
 Light-mediated relaxation of smooth muscle has been recently demonstrated. Non-visual opsins
expressed on smooth muscle have been implicated as the key mediator of relaxation via light within the visible
spectrum. However the mechanism of relaxation has yet to be fully understood. Our group has demonstrated
that this phenomenon is also present in airway smooth muscle with light-mediated relaxation modulated by opsin
receptors coupled to G protein signaling pathways. In preliminary studies, we demonstrate that airway smooth
muscle photorelaxation is wavelength- and intensity-dependent and that light induces an interaction between the
opsin 3 receptor and Gαs demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. This was associated with an increase in
intracellular cyclic AMP, a known key second messenger of airway smooth muscle relaxation. We propose to
identify the opsin receptors subtype(s), the G protein(s) and the cellular signaling pathways (e.g. cAMP, cGMP,
and cytoskeletal regulatory proteins (RhoA, CPI-17 and myosin light chain-20) that modulate airway smooth
muscle photorelaxation. We will also explore the mechanism of activation by modulating the light wavelength
sensitivity of airway smooth muscle. Normally opsin receptors bind 11-cis-retinal (a chromophore and co-
activator with photons of light) to form a Schiff base. The 11-cis-retinal allows for photoisomerization that changes
the conformation of the opsin receptor, which induces downstream cellular signaling. Derivatives of retinal have
been shown to shift the sensitivity of opsins to longer wavelengths. In our proposal we demonstrate that the use
of 11-cis 2,3 didehydroretinal shifts airway smooth muscle sensitivity to longer wavelengths. We propose to
evaluate additional retinal derivatives in cellular, in vivo and ex vivo models to identify chromophores that can
shift the wavelength sensitivity of endogenous opsins to respond to longer wavelengths of light that may
penetrate the body. In the eye, the sensitivity to different wavelengths of light is not only a function of the specific
ligand but also a function of the subtype of opsin receptor expressed. Transfection of variants of OPN1 will allow
evaluation of specific ligands at varying wavelengths of light in airway smooth muscle that activate cellular
signaling congruent with relaxation. We will explore the direct activation of opsin receptors by carotene
metabolites in the absence of light. We will demonstrate that the endogenous metabolite of carotenes, β-ionone,
is a phytochemical that can directly activate opsin 3 in the absence of light. We will show that the same pro-
relaxant cellular signaling occurs in airway smooth muscle when the opsin 3 receptor is directly activated by -
ionine as compared to activation by chromophores/light. These proposed studies will allow for a better
understanding of the activation and signaling of a previously uncharacterized receptor expressed in airway
smooth muscle that modulates pro-relaxant signaling pathways."

Scleroderma is a connective tissue disorder of unknown etiology affecting the skin, lungs and other visceral
organs. The disease is characterized by immune dysfunction, vascular pathology, chronic inflammation,
fibroblast overproliferation and collagen buildup. Although there are limited treatment options including
immunosuppressive drugs, these therapies only alleviate symptoms but are unable to reverse established
fibrosis and cure scleroderma. Thus, there is an opportunity to develop novel antifibrotic therapies that target
chief drivers of the disease: fibroblast overproliferation and collagen accumulation.
According to our new study, esomeprazole and its topically-formulated analog (coined Dermaprazole) might
halt progression of scleroderma. This understanding is based on our extended studies of high throughput
screening (HTS) 130,000 small molecules to discover compounds that regulate processes involved in tissue
inflammation and fibrosis. Our molecular, cell biological and in vivo data demonstrate that systemic
administration of esomeprazole inhibits lung inflammation and fibrosis by 50%. The study also showed that
esomeprazole is anti-proliferative with profound effect on fibroblast proliferation, and differentiation into
myofibroblasts. Encouraged by these, we recently reformulated esomeprazole into Dermaprazole for the
treatment of scleroderma with limited cutaneous involvement, while the systemic esomeprazole is being
developed for severe forms of the disease. Our data using human 3D skin model, dermal fibroblasts isolated
from scleroderma patients, and mouse models of scleroderma demonstrated that both forms of the drug are
effective in inhibiting fibrosis and restoring normal skin appearance. In addition, systemic esomeprazole was
found to suppress lung fibrosis secondary to skin fibrosis in a model of systemic sclerosis.
Our molecular studies indicate that esomeprazole/Dermaprazole modulate fibrosis through nuclear
translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to activate heme
oxygenase 1 (HO1), and suppress key extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Molecular studies also show that
activation of HO1 by esomeprazole involves phosphorylation of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)
pathway. Accordingly, we plan to test our central hypothesis: esomeprazole/Dermaprazole is able to slow or
halt established fibrosis in scleroderma in MAPK/Nrf2/HO1 dependent manner. To test this, we propose the
following Specific Aims: i) Understand the mechanism(s) by which esomeprazole activates HO1 to control
inflammatory and fibrotic processes in scleroderma. In this Aim, we will evaluate the mechanistic interaction
between esomeprazole, MAPK and Nrf2 to activate HO1 and its effectors, as well as investigate whether
activation of Nrf2/HO1 by esomeprazole is required in the regulation of scleroderma fibroblast proliferation and
collagen deposition. ii) Evaluate the efficacy of esomeprazole/Dermaprazole in modulating dermal and lung
fibrosis in vivo using wildtype, Nrf2, and MAPK knockout mouse models of scleroderma."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are rare cells that reside in the bone marrow (BM) where they are maintained
by specialized microenvironments (termed niches) in which endothelial, stromal, and other hematopoietic cells
synthesize important niche factors that regulate HSC function. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an essential
component of the BM niche. These rare non-hematopoietic perivascular stromal cells are characterized by their
unique ability to self-renew and differentiate into bone, cartilage, and fat, ensuring proper skeletal development
and maintenance. BM MSCs form specialized niches that regulate HSC function by secreting high levels of niche
factors such as CXC-chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), stem cell factor (SCF), and Vascular Cell Adhesion
Molecule-1 (VCAM1). VCAM1 is classically expressed on endothelial and stromal cells where it acts as an
adhesion molecule that preferentially binds to α4β1 integrin on HSCs and progenitors. Deletion of Vcam1 in
endothelial and hematopoietic cells induces HSC and progenitor cell (HSPC) mobilization into the peripheral
blood without affecting endothelial cell (EC) homeostasis. However, while the contribution of endothelial-derived
VCAM1 to BM homeostasis has been extensively studied, the specific role of MSC-derived VCAM1 on HSC and
on MSC maintenance and multilineage potency remains unknown. Our supporting data indicates that MSCs are
the BM’s main source of Vcam1 and suggests that VCAM1 is critical for the maintenance, survival, and function
of MSCs. Since MSCs are important regulators of HSC function and essential for skeleton and BM stroma
formation and maintenance, it is critical to understand the extent at which MSC-derived Vcam1 deletion impacts
MSCs and hematopoietic homeostasis. Based on our supporting data, I hypothesize that MSC-derived VCAM1
expression is critical for MSC maintenance and niche functions. The overall aims of this project are to
elucidate the mechanisms by which VCAM1 promotes MSC survival and regulates HSPC function. Altogether,
our proposal will provide mechanistic evidence for VCAM1 as a novel regulator of MSCs. While the critical
regulators of HSC maintenance and differentiation have been intensively studied, that of BM niche MSCs still
remain largely unknown. Our studies will not only aid in our understanding of MSCs but also the mechanisms
encompassing HSC maintenance to ultimately help improve treatments for hematopoietic diseases."
10737615,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among adult Latina-American individuals has
been on the rise despite strong familial-oriented belief systems 1–6. However, the exact role of marianismo as a
determinant and predictor has been argued as a simultaneous protective and risk factor. Conflict between
familial expectations and personal desires is thought to explain this health disparity 2-4. Basic psychological
needs theory (BPNT) links the undermining of personal autonomy with detrimental emotional affect, and is
hypothesized to have a unique, explanatory role in Latina familial-adult child relationships that result in
depression and anxiety. Familial support of marianismo – female-specified cultural scripts that prioritize familial
cohesion and spirituality – can directly suppress Latina-Americans' personal desires 7,8 and can explain why
Latinas are more susceptible to experiencing negative affect across their lifespan 9–13 . However, familial
support of marianismo, when not discrepant from self-endorsement can buffer the Latina against a multitude of
health disparities and explain protective qualities 14–19 . The broad aim is to test multi-domain relational and
individual mechanisms underlying depression, anxiety, and stress among Latina-American adults,
specifically examining personal versus familial marianismo belief discrepancy (or similarity) as a
potential source of tension enhancing risk of depressive and anxiety symptomology. Further, this
proposal employs (BPNT) to explain these differential mental health outcomes. BPNT autonomy (feeling
authentic) and relatedness (feeling belonging with the family) have demonstrated significant mental health
consequences for adult children when unsupported by familial relationships 20-22. However, no study has
investigated marianismo as differences in self versus familial beliefs, which satisfy or frustrate autonomy and
relatedness, in relation to Latina-American depression, anxiety, and stress. This proposal addresses these
gaps by (a) examining the links between marianismo self-endorsement and familial-endorsement as
determinants of risk to depression, anxiety, and stress symptomology; (b) illustrating and understanding need
frustrations (autonomy and relatedness) as explanatory mechanisms for negative mental affect; and (c)
conducting three mediational models representing different statistical strategies to capture discrepancy.
Further, in concordance with the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) goals to
identify mechanisms and protective factors of disparities, this study aims to elucidate how depression and
anxiety symptoms might be aggravated due to discrepancies between personal and familial beliefs in female
cultural scripts, thus integrating BPNT to explain these protective and risk factors unique to Latina-Americans."
10754227,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Pregnant women in high HIV-burden settings such as western Kenya are at increased
risk of acquiring HIV infection during pregnancy. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Ministry of Health
in Kenya recommend a comprehensive HIV prevention package for pregnant women in high HIV-burden settings
including oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), STI screening and treatment, and partner testing. However, poor
utilization of antenatal care limits opportunities for timely identification and delivery of HIV prevention
interventions. In Kenya, community pharmacies are often the first point of contact for basic health services and
an important entryway for reproductive health services. Leveraging existing structures, such as community
pharmacies, can create cost-efficient opportunities for improving access to HIV prevention interventions among
pregnant women. However, it is unclear which combination of interventions would best satisfy pregnant women’s
needs and optimize uptake, which strategies should be used for implementation, and the cost of extending
implementation of these interventions to community pharmacy settings. The overall objective of this study is to
design and evaluate strategies to implement HIV prevention interventions for pregnant women in community
pharmacy settings. In Aim 1, we propose to conduct a discrete choice experiment to quantify preferences for
delivery of HIV prevention interventions (including PrEP, STI screening and treatment, and partner testing) for
pregnant women in community pharmacy settings. Latent class analysis will be used to quantify women’s stated
preferences and identify packages of intervention components that optimize uptake among different subgroups
of women. In Aim 2, we will identify provider- and system-level factors that might influence implementation of the
optimal intervention packages and select strategies to improve implementation. Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate
the potential costs of extending implementation of HIV prevention interventions from the clinic to community
pharmacy settings under a range of different intervention packages (Aim 1) and implementation strategies (Aim
2). The proposed research aims complement my training goals in (1) community-based model design for HIV
prevention intervention delivery, (2) stated-preference theory and methods and the application of discrete-choice
experiments, (3) implementation science, and, in particular, implementation strategy design, and (4) advanced
costing methods and their application to costing implementation strategies. Successful completion of these aims
will enable me, as part of a future R01, to pilot test and assess the acceptability, feasibility, and impact of a
pharmacy-based model for delivering HIV prevention interventions to pregnant women. My long-term goal is to
become an independent implementation scientist and design new models of care to implement and scale HIV
prevention interventions for pregnant women. Alongside outstanding expertise from an interdisciplinary
mentoring team and the excellent training and research environment at The University of Washington, this career
development award provides a solid foundation for me to launch my career as an independent researcher."
10748418,"The accumulation of misfolded proteins represents a common pathological mechanism of most major
neurodegenerative disorders. Neuronal inclusions comprised of aggregated α-Synuclein (aSyn), known as
Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy-neurites (LNs), represent a key histopathological feature of Parkinson's disease
(PD) and a family of related disorders known as synucleinopathies, most notably Dementia with LBs (DLB).
LBs are also a prominent feature in nearly half of Alzheimer's disease subjects. Mutations and amplifications in
the SNCA gene encoding aSyn also cause familial forms of PD. Although a large body of histological and
genetic evidence firmly indicate a correlation between aSyn accumulation and disease, it remains unclear how
aSyn pathology actually forms and subsequently contributes to disease. We and others recently demonstrated
that minute quantities of recombinant or patient-derived aSyn aggregates can catalyze the formation of toxic
LBs/LNs in cultured neurons and healthy non-transgenic mice. In both human PD and animal models, this
“seeded” aSyn pathology progressively propagates and spreads to neuroanatomically connected regions,
reminiscent of prion diseases. Importantly, animals with LBs/LNs recapitulate the cardinal features of PD,
including progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons and locomotor deficits.
This R01 renewal addresses several key biological questions posed by our earlier findings and combines novel
molecular, in vivo, and computational tools to further understand how LBs/LNs form, propagate, and ultimately
contribute to neurodegeneration and neurological symptoms. Aim 1 will identify at the neuron subtypes that
develop LBs/LNs following inoculation with misfolded aSyn. By combining traditional histological methods with
FACS-assisted single-neuron RNAseq, we will determine the molecular signatures associated with
subpopulations that are vulnerable or resistant to LBs/LNs formation. Aim 2 will examine how PD genetic risk
factors reported in the literature intersect with aSyn pathobiology, by testing the effect of knock-down or knock-
in of individual genes on the formation of seeded pathology and neuronal survival. Candidates that significantly
alter either will be confirmed in vivo using knock-out/knock-in mouse lines. Lastly, Aim 3 will integrate our
molecular, genetic, and in vivo experimental data together with publicly available connectivity and gene-
expression atlases to interrogate the mechanisms of pathological spread. Using recently developed
mathematical approaches to describe infectious agent spread, we will develop in silico models to understand
aSyn pathology formation and spread. Completion of these studies should provide valuable insights into the
potential mechanisms by which aSyn contribute to the progression of PD and related disorders. Increased
understanding of the pathogenesis of this and related synucleinopathies should ultimately result in earlier
detection and disease-modifying therapies for these currently incurable disorders."
10760265,"Excess glucocorticoids contribute to the development of diabetes and metabolic syndrome, which includes: obesity, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance, and liver steatosis. Glucocorticoids exert their physiological effects via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a transcription factor that binds chromatin at GRE motifs leading to gene activation or repression. Our published work identified a previously unrecognized mechanism for GR-mediated gene regulation through its collaboration with the SET domain-containing protein, SETDB2, to activate a select subset of GR gene targets in the liver associated with diabetes. We showed livers of mice deficient in SETDB2 have a significantly blunted glucocorticoid response as demonstrated by fasting hypoglycemia and lack of induction of key GR target genes. Since inhibition of glucocorticoid action in liver can prevent the negative metabolic effects of glucocorticoid-induced diabetes, we hypothesize that liver-specific
SETDB2-knockout (DB2-LKO) mice will be partially protected from metabolic dysfunction when exposed to conditions that lead to elevated glucocorticoids. Fundamental mechanisms associated with glucocorticoid-induced metabolic disease are studied by evaluating the effects of liver-specific DB2-LKO and liver-specific GR-LKO on glucose/lipid homeostasis under conditions of elevated endogenous glucocorticoids (diet- induced obesity) or exogenous glucocorticoid administration. Metabolic parameters associated with diabetes will be measured: weight gain, glucose-intolerance, insulin-resistance, hyperlipidemia, and hepatic steatosis. Additionally, the molecular mechanism for the combined action of SETDB2 and GR will be characterized within these experimental paradigms and novel gene targets and chromatin targeting will be identified by RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and Hi-ChIP. Integrating the proposed experiments will provide a better understanding of how SETDB2 affects the positive and negative actions of GR that are relevant to metabolic disease in the liver. The
fundamental mechanism studied may provide a pathway to target SETDB2’s role in GR action as a new
therapeutic target for glucocorticoid-induced diabetes and metabolic disease. The experiments a balance of mechanistic and exploratory studies in mouse models to investigate the regulation of hepatic metabolic processes that are directly relevant to human disease. The results from both aims will be integrated together to reveal the overlapping and unique mechanisms by which the SETDB2-GR regulatory axis contributes to the adaptation of the liver to acute nutritional (Aim 1), chronic nutritional and hormonal (Aim 2) states of metabolic stress."

The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) has been at the forefront of clinical research to advance HIV
therapeutics and improve the health of people living with HIV/AIDS for 30 years. Rigorous scientific research
conducted by the ACTG has laid the cornerstones for current HIV treatment guidelines. In this application for
the competitive renewal of the ACTG we propose a transformative research agenda that draws on an
international consortium of leading clinical and laboratory HIV investigators in collaboration with a world-class
Statistics and Data Management Center to design and conduct innovative interventional clinical trials that will
significantly reduce the global burden of disease due to HIV, TB and hepatitis B.
The Leadership and Operations Center (LOC) provides scientific leadership and fiscal and organizational
management of the ACTG. The ACTG Executive Committee (AEC) will serve as the overarching governing
body of the network. The AEC is guided by an Executive Management Committee that includes the Network
Chairs, Chief Quality Officer and the Chairs of the Laboratory and Statistical and Data Management Centers.
Transformative Science Groups will oversee the development and execution of the ACTG research agenda,
which will be coordinated and prioritized by the Scientific Agenda Steering Committee (SASC). Protocol
development, implementation, training and network evaluation will be facilitated by the Network Clinical Core at
Social & Scientific Systems, Inc. The LOC financial management group (Admin Core) at the University of
California, Los Angeles will oversee resource management and protocol fund distribution at the direction of the
AEC. The LOC will assure the engagement of Community in all aspects of the ACTG, and will coordinate
communication between all three components of the network. Specific aims of this proposal include: 1) Identify
interventions to reduce HIV reservoirs and control HIV replication in the absence of ART; 2) Test novel and
durable interventions targeting HIV infection; 3) Improve the treatment and prevention of drug sensitive and drug
resistant tuberculosis; 4) Prevent or improve the treatment of HIV-related non-infectious co-morbidities and
evaluate strategies to cure hepatitis B virus infection in people with and without HIV."
10740877,"Although, we know much about the molecular signals that regulate OC function, we know relatively little about
the lineage and mechanisms that OC use to develop from progenitors. The goal of this application is to better
define OC progenitor (OCP) maturation and trafficking and the mechanisms regulating this process in health
and disease so that we can identify potential drug targets to develop superior therapies for bone diseases. The
central hypotheses are: 1) During homeostasis marrow-resident cells are the principal OCP source,
while during inflammation or fracture repair, circulating cells become a significant source of OCP.
2) The mechanisms regulating OCP migration, engraftment and maturation to OC in bone differ
between healthy and disease states. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following aims:
1. Define the role that CX3CR1+ OCP have in OC development during homeostasis and identify
mechanisms regulating their homing, engraftment and maturation to OC:
1A) Perform time course studies in CX3CR1-CreERT2-Ai14 mice at various ages to examine labeled OC
formation kinetics. We will also monitor the kinetics of labeled OCP in the bone marrow, blood and spleen.
1B) The chemokine receptor CX3CR1 is expressed on OCP and has previously been implicated to influence
OCP homing, engraftment and maturation. We will determine its role in OCP lineage development and
trafficking in vivo under homeostatic conditions (when marrow-derived cells predominate as the OCP source)
using CX3CR1-CreERT2-Ai14 mice to generate Cx3cr1 gene deletions.
2. Examine OCP homing from the circulation during bone inflammation and fracture repair.
These studies will examine two disease models in which we previously demonstrated that circulating OCP are
recruited to engraft in bone: TNFa-induced bone inflammation and a repairing fracture.
2A) Study a TNFa-induced inflammatory bone model (a WT parabiont has TNFα injected over its calvaria; the
other parabiont is a CX3CR1-EGFP; TRAP-tdTomato mouse) and determine the rate that circulating labeled
cells home to the inflammatory site, form OC and disappear.
2B) Study a parabiosis fracture model (a WT parabiont receives a femur fracture; the other parabiont is a
CX3CR1-EGFP; TRAP-tdTomato mouse) and determine the rate that circulating labeled cells home to the
repairing callus, form OC and disappear.
2C) Determine the phenotype and kinetics of circulating OCP that home, mature and engraft in bone with
TNFa-induced inflammation or fracture repair by injecting selected populations of OCP from CX3CR1-EGFP;
TRAP-tdTomato mice and monitoring the rates that labeled OC appear and disappear in bone.
2D) Determine the effect that deletion of Cx3cr1 has on the ability of circulating OCP to home, engraft and
mature in bone with TNFa-induced inflammation or a fracture repair using parabiosis and adoptive transfer."

increased morbidity and mortality in children and immunocompromised individuals. Cryptosporidium is one of
the most important pathogens leading to poor outcomes in <2-yo malnourished children in resource poor
countries, including >3-fold mortality and strong associations with stunting and impaired neurological
development. The only available therapeutic, nitazoxanide, does not work in immunocompromised individuals
and has <30% efficacy in malnourished children. New therapeutics for Cryptosporidium are badly needed. We
have been developing bumped-kinase inhibitors (BKIs) that selectively target Cryptosporidium calcium-
dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) as therapeutics for cryptosporidiosis. In our program, our leads have
performed very well, demonstrating efficacy at low oral dosages in mouse, calf, and piglet models of C. parvum
and C. hominis, while retaining almost all the favorable safety aspects consistent with a late lead. However,
safety issues with BKI leads have stopped us from developing current late leads. We now understand the
safety issues associated with late BKI leads and have found these safety issues are not inextricably associated
with the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of BKIs’ efficacy against cryptosporidiosis. In this proposal, we will
use the efficacy and safety SAR to help drive medicinal chemistry towards a late pre-clinical lead with safety,
pharmacokinetic, and efficacy properties that can be developed for treatment in the target population of <2-yo
malnourished children and immunocompromised individuals. The Aims are: AIM 1) Establish late leads for
cryptosporidiosis therapy, including Subaims 1A) In vitro efficacy and safety testing, 1B) IFN- γ -KO mouse
nLuc-C. parvum efficacy testing, 1C) Mouse multidosing, 7d safety testing, 1D) Determine metabolites of BKIs,
and, 1E) Design and synthesize new BKIs; AIM 2) Test novel late leads in calf clinical model for
cryptosporidiosis; and, AIM 3) Assess advanced late leads for late safety testing, including subaims 3A) Bone
safety testing, 3B) Pregnancy/developmental/fetal safety testing; 3C) Rat and dog cardiovascular (CV) safety
testing, and, 3D) Pre-GLP safety and polymorph testing. At the end of the grant period, we expect to have a
preclinical lead and at least one back up molecule that is ready to move into GLP safety testing, pre-GMP
manufacturing scale up, and IND filing to move towards human trials for a BKI for therapy of cryptosporidiosis."
10755315,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and is the second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths among women. Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) affects approximately 15-20% of
all breast cancer patients, is the most aggressive sub-type of breast cancer and accounts for a
disproportionately higher fraction of cancer-related morbidities and mortalities. Treatment options are
extremely limited for TNBC patients and the most commonly employed neoadjuvant and adjuvant
chemotherapy drugs have existed for decades. De novo and acquired chemotherapy resistance remains a
major problem and disease recurrence results in breast cancer-related death for the large majority of patients.
Further complicating the clinical management of TNBC is the lack of FDA-approved targeted therapies that can
be utilized to prevent disease recurrence in the adjuvant setting. Thus, the identification and validation of novel
drug targets and more effective treatment options continues to represent a major unmet clinical need. We have
demonstrated that Estrogen Receptor Beta (ERβ) is expressed in approximately 20% of TNBCs, and have
shown that patients with ERβ positive tumors have improved long-term prognosis. In addition, we have shown
that ligand-mediated activation of ERβ by estradiol, or ERβ selective agonists, inhibits TNBC cell line and
patient derived xenograft proliferation, invasion, and migration in vitro, as well as primary tumor growth and
metastatic spread in vivo. Importantly, we provide the first evidence that estradiol can elicit clinical benefit in a
patient with ERβ positive metastatic and chemo-refractory TNBC. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that ERβ
potently suppresses the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway in TNBC cells, effects that are mediated
through association of ERβ with EZH2/PRC2 leading to epigenetic modifications to histone residues at NFκB
target gene loci. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that ERβ modifies chemotherapy responsiveness of
TNBC cell line models and patient derived organoids and inhibits chemo-resistant cell lines. Based on these
data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that ERβ repurposes EZH2 to inhibit NFκB signaling in TNBC
thereby eliciting anti-cancer effects and enhancing chemotherapeutic responsiveness. To test this hypothesis,
the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1). Determine the molecular mechanisms by which ERβ suppresses
NFκB signaling in TNBC and 2). Elucidate the biological importance and clinical significance of ERβ-mediated
suppression of NFκB signaling in TNBC using novel genetically engineered mice, PDX/PDO models and
patient specimens. To conduct these Aims, we will utilize multiple model systems, innovative approaches and
molecular tools, to comprehensively address our focused hypothesis. Given the extremely poor outcomes in
women with TNBC, the proposed studies are of critical importance towards the goal of improving treatment
strategies to more effectively manage this disease."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) require fine-tuned cooperation of transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic
regulators to maintain normal self-renewal. Precise control of this ability is essential to suppress aberrant
proliferation. Understanding the regulation of self-renewal is therefore crucial for gaining insight into normal
and neoplastic hematopoiesis. PHF6, an enigmatic, leukemia-mutated, chromatin-binding protein specifically
represses HSC self-renewal, providing an attractive model for dissecting the underlying regulatory network.
The goal of this proposal is to illuminate a mechanistic link between normal self-renewal and aberrant
proliferation through dissection of how PHF6 modulates enhancers bound by key hematopoietic TFs.
Our in vivo studies show that Phf6 hematopoietic knockout specifically increases HSC self-renewal while
leaving downstream hematopoiesis largely unperturbed. Pilot experiments indicate that constitutive HOXA9
expression cooperates with Phf6 loss to cause rapid, lethal progenitor expansion. We have thus identified
profoundly contrasting homeostatic and HOXA9-driven phenotypes of Phf6 loss, providing an ideal system to
study how HSC self-renewal is co-opted in aberrant proliferation. Our preliminary data show that PHF6 binds
and represses enhancers co-occupied by the TFs RUNX1, PU.1, IRF8. We have thus identified a mechanistic
basis for PHF6 activity (chromatin co-occupancy with key hematopoietic TFs).
We hypothesize that PHF6 represses HSC self-renewal and aberrant myeloid progenitor expansion through a
common mechanism of modulating enhancers bound by RUNX1, PU.1, and IRF8.
Specific Aim 1: We will determine the role of PHF6 in repressing HSC self-renewal and myeloid progenitor
expansion in vivo by determining whether Phf6 loss accelerates HOXA9-driven myeloid progenitor expansion,
whether R274Q mutation abrogates PHF6 functions in HSCs and myeloid progenitors, and whether Phf6 loss
activates RUNX1/PU.1/IRF8-bound enhancers. The experiments in Aim 1 will advance our understanding of
HSC biology by linking self-renewal to aberrant expansion through a core regulatory circuit downstream of
PHF6.
Specific Aim 2: We will determine the mechanism of PHF6 activity in vitro by determining whether
RUNX1/PU.1/IRF8 recruit PHF6 to chromatin, whether R274Q mutation abrogates PHF6 chromatin binding,
and whether PHF6 recruits additional complexes to repress enhancer activity. The experiments in Aim 2 will
illuminate the sequence of events from recruitment of PHF6 to chromatin by key TFs, to the downstream
effects of PHF6 on enhancer function and consequently on gene expression.
These studies, if successful, will pinpoint a disease-relevant mechanism linking HSC self-renewal to aberrant
progenitor expansion through modulation of enhancers by PHF6 in conjunction with hematopoietic TFs. This
will be an important advance in our understanding of the epigenetic regulation of HSC self-renewal."
10733428,"Project Summary/Abstract
Living cells have evolved intricate mechanisms to detect their environment and transduce signals across
biological membranes, inducing responses in organismal behavior. Despite the prevalence of these receptors,
our understanding of the discrete mechanisms by which signals are propagated across membranes is still
evolving. In this area, histidine kinases (HKs) are a predominant class of membrane receptors in bacteria, fungi,
and plants that regulate growth, survival, or pathogenicity. HKs sense diverse extracellular stimuli and transduce
a signal across the membrane and through multiple subdomains, activating a phosphorylation cascade and
inducing a transcriptional response. Early models proposed that HKs do so through large, rigid body shifts after
sensing extracellular stimuli. Subsequent work indicates that signals are passed between HK subdomains in a
step-wise manner, often through changes in protein dynamics, informing the hypothesis that signal transduction
is the result of thermodynamic coupling between subdomains of the HK complex. This further implies that many
conformations may be adopted in the course of HK signaling. To investigate the molecular and biophysical basis
of HK specificity and signal transduction, we propose a structure and protein design approach to interrogate
energetic thresholds, sensor specificity, and conformational bias in transmembrane signaling. First, rational and
de novo design will be used to generate non-native, thermodynamically tunable sensor domains to determine
what ligand-induced energetic response is sufficient to initiate signaling. This will be complemented with
experimental characterization of synthetic, orthogonal sensor domains identified through a sequence- and
structure-guided neural network algorithm. In parallel, we will pursue X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron
microscopy to elucidate the structure of HK complexes or isolated subdomains in various signaling states, to
inform assembly of structure-conformation-function relationships. This research will significantly advance our
understanding of energetics and dynamics in transmembrane signal transduction while advancing our ability to
use protein design and computational biology to interrogate and engineer complex biophysical mechanisms. The
proposed efforts will also directly fulfill the training goals of my postdoctoral tenure, affording the necessary skills
to prepare me for an independent research career studying and engineering signal transduction mechanisms."
10757356,"Background: The Veterans Health Administration (VA) mandated expanded community care services for
Veterans with the VA Maintaining Systems & Strengthening Integrated outside Networks (MISSION) Act of
2018. As a result, the VA has increasingly partnered with community-based facilities and growing number of
Veterans Living with Dementia (VLWD) will receive community and VA care (dual-users). However, there are
gaps in care for dual-use Veterans, including increased hospitalization and fragmented care.
Significance/Impact:
Understanding community care for dual-use Veteran health outcomes, care quality, and
safety is crucial and provides objective measures of MISSION Act. My CDA is significant for its potential to
uncover current transitional care gaps, while creating an adaptable, pragmatic intervention aimed at reducing
adverse outcomes for VLWD.
Innovation:
My CDA uses mixed methods to inform the identification of adverse transitional outcomes among
VLWD and the adaptation of a pilot intervention.
The VA is undergoing a major transformation due to the
MISSION Act. My CDA research is innovative in assessing community care for VLWD, is the first to assess
outcomes for VLWD in the MISSION Act era and inform adapted pilot intervention. The methods developed
and applied in this CDA will provide a roadmap for evaluating and comparing outcomes across care settings
while also identifying barriers and facilitators to transitions in care.
Specific Aims
Aim 1: Understand health care utilization patterns and associated outcomes of dual-use VLWD.
Aim 2: Understand preferences and transitional care needs of dual-use VLWD, their care partners, and
clinicians through qualitative interviews.
Aim 3: Adapt and pilot test an evidence-based transitional care model to improve transitional care outcomes
for VLWD following ED visit and/or hospitalization.
This work has the support of the VA
offices of Geriatrics and Extended Care, community care and emergency
medicine and
aligns with VA priority-- research focused on national legislative priorities affecting Veteran care,
notably the MISSION Act.
Methodology: We will use a mixed methods sequential quantitative-to-qualitative design. First, we will perform
a quantitative study of dual-use VLWD to understand factors that contribute to adverse outcomes (30-day re-
hospitalizations, 30-day ED readmissions and mortality within 30 days of hospital discharge). Second, we will
perform a qualitative study of dual-use VLWD (n = 25), their family caregivers (n = 25) and their clinicians (n =
25) to identify transitional care priorities and needs. Third, we will use findings from Aims 1 and 2 to adapt and
pilot an intervention aimed at reducing adverse outcomes of VLWD. Using mixed-methods, we will test the
feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.
Next steps: This CDA findings will be the basis for future work to study the effectiveness and impact on
Veteran outcomes."
10755688,"Project Summary
 New diagnostic tools capable of rapidly identifying and quantifying bacteria within intra-abdominal
infections are needed to help clinicians select appropriate antibiotics during the critical early stages of
treatment. Current molecular diagnostics remain costly and require access to significant laboratory
infrastructure, making them inappropriate for use in small satellite laboratories within the hospital
environment. Here we seek to address this urgent need by developing a simple, inexpensive, and
automated microfluidic platform capable of evaluating bacteria directly from intra-abdominal abscess
fluids to guide initial treatment of infection. The technology will combine on-chip nucleic acid extraction,
rapid quantitative PCR (qPCR), and high resolution melt analysis (HRMA) for multiplexed pathogen
identification and quantification in under 10 min. The platform will consist of disposable thermoplastic
microwell chips and a compact USB-powered reader containing all components for assay operation.
Significantly, the entire assay will require only two pipette strokes to discretize sample within a dense
array of microliter reaction wells containing all primers and other reagents needed for assay execution.
The integration of multiplexed PCR primers into the thermoplastic microwell array during chip
manufacture will enable automated thermally-controlled release during PCR, while passive sample
discretization within the disposable microwell arrays will further simplify assay operation. Assay times
below 10 min will be enabled by integrated thin film electrodes and a unique thermoplastic fabrication
technique supporting optimal thermal transport. A disposable piezoelectric element integrated into the
chip inlet tube will enable efficient release of nucleic acids prior to sample discretization, and the assay
will be operated through an embedded mixed-signal processor supporting all functions, with power
and communication provided through a single USB connection to a laptop computer. Using this
system, multiplexed qPCR for bacteria identification plus HRMA for product validation will be
demonstrated, followed by an investigation of qPCR-HRMA based pathogen identification using
unique signatures in the 16S rRNA gene, with a theoretical detection limit of 50 CFU/mL. The
technology will be validated within a hospital environment through a clinical study with 50 patients for
the simultaneous quantification of 8 bacteria commonly found in intra-abdominal infections, conditions
where treatment currently relies on subjective visual assessment and empiric treatment, and where
rapid near-patient bacterial identification would transform clinical practice."
10754875,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the global rise in fungal infections,
including those by endemic sp
., there is no licensed fungal vaccine
available. This is mainly due to poor understanding of mechanisms of vaccine immunity, and lack of
a functional
phenotypic marker associated with
vaccine efficacy. Opportunistic fungal infections, including those caused by
dimorphic fungi, Histoplasma, Coccidiodes and Blastomyces, are rising at an alarming rate in such at-risk
individuals. A major limitation in the development of tailored fungal vaccines for the at-risk population is poor
understanding of
requisite elements of CD8+ T cell responses to mediate vaccine-immunity.
Recent advances in
the understanding of immune correlates against fungal infections has helped in advancing vaccinology in parallel.
T-cell derived IL-17A, IFNγ, GM-CSF, IL-22, and TNFα are primarily involved in protection against fungi.
Identification of potential targets on host cells can provide novel efficacious vaccine platforms, including for
immunocompromised. We have established a mouse model of CD4+ T cell lymphopenia, where CD8+ T cells
can be stimulated to produce protective cytokines IL-17A (Tc17) and IFNγ (Tc1) to execute a sterilizing immunity
against lethal pulmonary fungal infection. We have shown that vaccine-elicited antifungal CD8+ T cells persisted
as long-term functional memory. In this proposal, we present seminal findings: 1. GM-CSF+ Tc17 cells bolster
vaccine-immunity without pathology; 2. Anti-fungal CD8+ T cells preferentially express O-glycosylated
Sialophorin; and 3. Sialophorin is required for differentiation and expansion of CD8+ T cells. Therefore, our
central hypotheses are that (1) Sialophorin acts as a co-stimulator for CD8+ T cell responses, (2) retention of
Sialophorin is essential for memory CD8+ T-cell homeostasis and recall responses, (3) Sialophorin signaling
potentiates cross-presentation to augment CD8+ T cell responses. Our specific aims are to: 1. Determine and
dissect the role of Sialophorin for CD8+ T-cell fungal vaccine responses. We will decipher and delineate the cell-
intrinsic role of Sialophorin for vaccine-induced Tc17 and Tc1 cell responses using adoptive transfer and bone-
marrow chimera experiments, and using TCRα KO, congenic and crosses of Sialophorin KO mice. 2. Elucidate
the role of Sialophorin for memory T cell homeostasis and recall responses during fungal pneumonia. We will
define the role of Sialophorin for vaccine-induced memory CD8+ T-cell homeostasis, recall responses, and
vaccine-immunity. We will use bone marrow chimera, adoptive transfers, CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing, in vivo
stimulation, and E-selectin blocking to delineate the role of Sialophorin on memory CD8+ T-cell responses. 3.
Dissect the role of Sialophorin on dendritic cells for CD8+ T-cell fungal vaccine responses.
We will identify the
role of CD43 on antigen-presenting cells for activation of CD8+ T cells following vaccination
. Our findings will
uncover the functional role of Sialophorin for fungal CD8+ T-cell responses and immunity to guide in the design
of novel vaccine platforms and test the efficacy of vaccines."
10745304,"Many neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, are characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and defects
in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, why the central nervous system is more prone to these defects
than other tissues is unknown. In addition, several of the CNS-associated diseases show sexual disparity but,
again, the mechanistic source of this observation is unclear. The current application addresses both the
increased sensitivity of the CNS to proteostasis and mitochondrial defects and sex disparity. The Germain group
first described an estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) driven axis of the mitochondria unfolded protein response
(UPRmt), which promotes the activity of the proteasome, as well as the transcription of mitochondrial genes. More
recently, the Germain and Manfredi labs characterized this pathway in the SOD1-G93A model of familial ALS, a
model in which males show earlier disease onset than females. We found that females maintain the ability to
activate the ER axis of the UPRmt longer than males. These observations raise the possibility that interventions
aimed at activating the ERa axis of the UPRmt early on in the disease course may delay the progression of ALS
and potentially other CNS-associated diseases. Data presented in this application demonstrate that treatment
with the FDA-approved selective estrogen modulator (SERM) raloxifene, but not estrogen or tamoxifen up-
regulates expression of both the activity of the proteasome at multiple levels and mitochondria genes. Further,
we found that raloxifene delays disease progression in this model, in females specifically, despite the fact that
the serum level achieved in our trial was 10-fold lower than what is possible to achieve clinically in humans
treated chronically with raloxifene. This suggests that raloxifene is unique in its remarkable ability to increase
two of the key pathways associated with diseases affecting the spinal cord, such as ALS, and possibly other
components of the CNS. Moreover, our findings also suggest that if levels of raloxifene closer to those achieved
with human regimens can be achieve in mice, the protective effect of raloxifene could be much improved. Based
on these results, we propose the three following specific aims. Aim 1: Understanding the molecular basis of the
differential effect of estrogen, tamoxifen and raloxifene on the transcriptional activity of the ER in the spinal cord
and expand the analysis of their effects on other parts of the CNS. Aim 2: Optimize raloxifene delivery,, alone
or in combination with the proteasome activator oleuropein and extend the beneficial effect to males. Aim 3:
Extending raloxifene-based therapy to a mutant Ubiquilin2 mouse model of ALS/FTD. The program proposed
here is an aggressive and ambitious attempt at testing the neuroprotective effects of raloxifene in ALS. As
thousands of Americans suffer from this devastating disease, which has no effective therapy, we feel that the
ambitious approaches proposed are well justified."

Antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) is of significant public health importance in mentally ill populations,
potentially addressable with personalized, precision medicine. Antipsychotic medications increase body weight,
thereby increasing cardiometabolic risk (CMR) conditions like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease,
conditions associated with accelerated cellular aging. This has contributed to a 10 to 15-year mortality gap
between mentally ill individuals and the general population. Antipsychotic medications are commonly used at all
ages, but are associated with differential patterns of fat gain, whereby children gain more and older adults gain
less. Numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified key genetic factors associated with
AIWG, but are limited by the use of indirect measures of body fat, like weight or body mass index (BMI), that are
less well correlated with metabolic disease risk. Additionally, existing research does not fully address age-related
differences in AIWG. In response to NIH PA-17-088 “Secondary Analyses of Existing Cohorts, Data Sets and
Stored Biospecimens to Address Clinical Aging Research Questions,” we propose a novel approach applying
population-based genetics, existing biospecimen with linked clinical data including precisely-measured adiposity
and insulin sensitivity, and advanced molecular tools to identify and functionally validate key genetic
determinants of AIWG and CMR across the age-span. This approach leverages 1) existing population-level data
from large biobanking initiatives and epidemiological studies inclusive of approximately 15,000 individuals with
genetic and relevant phenotypic data, 2) existing clinical and biospecimen data from NIH funded randomized
clinical trials or RCTs characterizing the metabolic effects of antipsychotics in children, adults and older adults
with direct and precise measures of body fat, together with data from approximately 600 individuals with genetic
data and additional biomarkers of metabolic risk, and 3) CRISPR based in vitro drug exposure, followed by
cellular functional assays to characterize molecular mechanisms impacted by antipsychotic. Additional sources
of existing data will be available upon funding, including data on approximately 3000 individuals from large
industry funded RCTs, data on up to 250,000 individuals from the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC, see
letter of support), and data from more than 2,000 individuals from the Dutch Bipolar Cohort Study (see letter of
support) will also be used for independent validation and replication. This study will combine unbiased genomic
methods, including array-based genotyping, GWAS and GWAS meta-analysis, CRISPR-based gene
inhibition/activation screens (CRISPRi/a), and functional molecular and cellular studies on prioritized variants of
interest, combined with unique clinical data to identify genetic factors and generate predictive models of weight
related physiological changes associated with accelerated aging. This combined set of molecular techniques will
allow us to build on known genetic associations, while discovering new genes and genetic variants that are
associated with the greatest risk for treatment-related fat gain in younger and older patients. This project will
contribute to the development of a precision-based treatment algorithm that can accurately predict and prevent
AIWG and cardiometabolic risk in youth, young, middle-aged, and older adults. The results from this study will
also importantly contribute to publicly available datasets, and motivate future collection of similar data necessary
for further validation of our results."
10763372,"Abstract
 Low back pain is the leading cause of disability in the United States, with an estimated socioeconomic cost
exceeding $100 billion each year. Intervertebral disc degeneration, a cascade of cellular, compositional,
structural and compositional changes, is strongly implicated as a cause of low back pain. Current clinical
approaches for treating low back pain associated with disc degeneration have limited long term efficacy as
they seek only to manage symptoms without restoring native disc structure and mechanical function. There is
an overwhelming clinical need for new treatment options, which target not only the symptoms of low
back pain, but also the underlying causes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an attractive option for cell-
based disc regeneration due to their safety, ease of isolation and ability to adopt phenotypes similar to those of
disc nucleus pulposus cells. A major challenge to successful MSC-based disc regeneration, however, is the
local cellular microenvironment, which presents conditions of limited nutrition, low oxygen, low pH, and
persistent inflammation that predispose therapeutic interventions to failure. The objective of this proposal is
to develop a novel biological therapy that maximizes the survival and anabolic potential of therapeutic
stem cells by simultaneously neutralizing the degenerate disc microenvironment via the sustained
delivery of nutrients, anti-inflammatory drugs and buffering agents. To accomplish this goal, we will
leverage our newly established goat model of disc degeneration that mimics clinically relevant
structural, composition and biomechanical characteristics, including tissue-level inflammation, and
novel drug delivery methods to enable controlled and sustained release of biofactors that neutralize
the degenerative microenvironment. In Aim 1 we will leverage our goat model define the in vivo cellular
microenvironment of the disc as a function of degeneration severity, using cutting edge in situ physiological
monitoring and ex vivo biomolecular assays. In Aim 2 we will optimize our novel microcapsule drug delivery
system to neutralize the degenerate disc microenvironment through sustained delivery of glucose, anti-
inflammatory drugs and buffering agents. In Aim 3 we will carry out short and long term in vivo studies to
establish therapeutic efficacy in our goat model, including clinically-relevant pain assessments. At the
conclusion of these studies we will have developed a rapidly translatable therapy that maximizes the
regenerative potential of MSCs in the disc microenvironment, and established long term preclinical
efficacy, thus placing us in a strong position to move towards human clinical trials."
10744202,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The relationship between psoriatic skin and joint disease remains enigmatic. A subset
of patients with psoriasis develop arthritis, early diagnosis of which is challenging. Additionally, therapies for
skin disease are less successful at treating arthritis. A20 (Tnfaip3) is a broadly-expressed protein that restricts
multiple inflammatory signaling pathways and is genetically associated with both psoriasis and psoriatic
arthritis in humans. However, the molecular and tissue-specific mechanisms by which A20 restricts psoriatic
disease are unknown. Our preliminary data shows that A20's capacity for binding linear ubiquitin is critical for
preventing distal digit psoriatic skin and joint disease in mice, with pathology requiring TNF, IL17A, and T-cells.
Early disease surrounded the epidermis; therefore, we generated mice allowing inducible deletion of A20 only
in keratinocytes in adulthood (A20iEKO mice). Remarkably, these mice also develop similar psoriatic skin and
joint disease that requires TNF, IL17A, and T-cells. I aim to determine the immune mechanisms by which A20
dysregulation in keratinocytes orchestrates skin and joint disease. Aim 1 centers around understanding the
cytokine requirements for coordinating the pathogenic immune infiltrate. In Aim 2 I will dissect the role of T-
cells by determining which subsets or antigen-specific cells are critical for pathogenic cytokine secretion as
well as their anatomical sites of action. Aim 3 focuses on the cell-intrinsic role of A20 in keratinocytes, where I
plan to understand the mechanisms by which A20 restricts inflammatory pathways in vivo, during keratinocyte
differentiation, and downstream TNFR and IL17R. Together, these studies will reveal how keratinocytes can
orchestrate an inflammatory process that results in psoriatic skin and joint disease. This is relevant to NIAMS
because these studies may help explain how human psoriasis is connected to psoriatic arthritis and may reveal
novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers for early or potential arthritic disease.
 My long-term goal is to establish an independent research program studying how inflammation remains
localized within epithelial tissues such as the skin. The studies described above will provide an outstanding
starting point as they aim to understand how skin dysregulation can cause joint inflammation. My research
background is primarily in cellular signaling and protein biochemistry. My career development aims are to build
my intellectual and scientific foundation in cellular immunology and develop professional relationships with
rheumatology-focused researchers. I also plan on developing key research skills in epithelial biology as well as
transcriptomic and statistical analysis. These development goals will be pursued with didactic courses along
with participation in seminar series, workshops, and conferences. Together with mentorship from Dr. Averil Ma,
a leading molecular immunologist, and guidance from a multidisciplinary scientific advisory committee of
immunologists, epithelial biologists, and genomics experts, these aims will position me for an independent
research career as a physician-scientist."
10757937,"Abstract
 Innate immune signaling pathways are activated in response to exposure to microorganisms, and
generally are effective in preventing pathogen invasion through inducing inflammation and host cell death.
However, its aberrant activation is known to be causally associated with many inflammatory diseases e.g.
cancers and neurodegeneration, as it could cause tissue damage through inflammation and cell death. The
innate immune signaling pathways are highly complex as they have evolved in response to evolving
microorganisms trying to evade the host immunity. Thus, the regulatory mechanisms of innate immunity
particularly their signaling connections/networks are incompletely understood. Understanding the complexities
of the innate immune signaling network is highly anticipated to impact our ability to develop strategies to fight
pathogen infection and to treat inflammatory diseases. We have been studying mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7), known as TAK1, since its discovery. Initially we identified that TAK1
mediates transcriptional activation of inflammatory responses by activating both MAPK cascades and NF-κB
pathways. More recently, through our characterization of numerous tissue-specific Tak1-deficient mouse
models we have revealed that TAK1 also participates in cell death. However, there remain unanswered
fundamental questions; why and how do the inflammatory and cell death pathways converge through TAK1?
The R35 stable funding mechanism is highly suitable for this challenging project. We have all the materials,
e.g. genetically engineered mouse models and pharmacological modulators, and experience for answering the
above central question. For the next 5 years, we propose to determine the molecular mechanisms of how
inflammatory and cell death pathways are connected at TAK1 and of how aberrant activation of TAK1 leads to
inflammatory diseases."
10794207,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hypertension (HT) affects ~48% of the US population. Increased renal sodium (Na+) retention is a major
contributor to the development of HT. The renal angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R), activated predominantly
by angiotensin (Ang) II, is both necessary and sufficient for inducing and sustaining HT during Ang II infusion.
Increased Na+ reabsorption in renal proximal tubule cells (RPTC) is a major determinant of this response. The
role of the angiotensin type-2 receptor (AT2R) in Na+ excretion and blood pressure (BP) control is less well
understood. AT2Rs are expressed in adult kidneys primarily in RPTC. Our past studies provided evidence for a
major role of RPT AT2Rs in the inhibition of renal Na+ reabsorption. Recently, we identified a defect in AT2R-
mediated natriuresis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) that pre-dates HT and can be circumvented by
direct renal administration of cyclic GMP (cGMP). Our results suggest that defective AT2R-induced natriuresis
may contribute to the pathogenesis of HT in SHR. The goals of this project are to (1) conclusively demonstrate
the role of AT2Rs in BP control using our newly developed RPTC-AT2R deficient mice, (2) identify downstream
AT2R signaling pathways mediating natriuresis, (3) characterize the primary RPTC AT2R defect(s) in SHR at
the cellular and molecular levels, and (4) validate renal cGMP and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activation
as specific therapeutic targets for HT. These goals will be addressed under three specific aims: (1) To test the
hypothesis that RPT AT2Rs are required for the regulation of Na+ excretion and blood pressure; (2) To test the
hypothesis that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) initiates and sustains RPTC AT2R signaling to induce
natriuresis; and (3) To test the hypothesis that intrarenal PP2A activation and/or restoration of cGMP
levels/signaling can normalize blood pressure in hypertensive SHR and RPTC-selective AT2R knockout mice.
The project will apply a combination of state-of-the-art in vivo and cellular and molecular techniques to
determine mechanisms by which AT2R regulates Na+ excretion and BP. These studies will help define the
pathophysiology of HT and open the door to new classes of drugs for the treatment of human primary HT."

Nickel (Ni) is a major industrial metal and a common environmental contaminant that is firmly
established as a human carcinogen. Inhalation of Ni compounds in occupationally exposed populations
has been found to cause lung and nasal cancers. Tumorigenicity of different forms of Ni was linked to
the intracellular presence of Ni(II) ions. Mechanisms of carcinogenic activity of Ni are poorly understood,
as Ni compounds were weak or negative in the standard mutagenicity assays and Ni(II) ions do not
react with DNA. Consequently, Ni is commonly described as a nongenotoxic carcinogen. However, Ni-
treated cultured cells and lymphocytes from Ni-exposed workers have consistently shown the presence
of chromosomal rearrangements that typically originate from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Also
contradicting its nongenotoxic description is the ability of Ni(II) to cause covalent DNA-protein crosslinks
(DPCs) in experimental animals and in occupationally exposed individuals. The presence of
chromosomal abnormalities and DPCs despite the apparent lack of mutagenicity and DNA reactivity
suggests that Ni may engage some unusual genotoxicity mechanisms. Based on extensive preliminary
results, this project is designed to investigate a novel hypothesis that Ni(II) causes DSBs, DPCs, and
cell transformation by inducing genotoxic topoisomerase I-DNA products. The proposed studies will
determine (1) mechanisms of Ni(II)-induced defects in homologous recombination repair of DSBs, (2)
the importance of error-prone DSB repair in the production of oncogenic genetic changes by Ni(II), and
(3) formation and pathophysiological significance of Ni-induced topoisomerase I-containing DPCs and
DNA breaks. The completion of this work is expected to uncover molecular mechanisms of the
formation of oncogenic genetic abnormalities by a nonmutagenic carcinogen Ni and identify novel
biomarkers of DNA damage by this metal."

 The effective treatment of drug resistant tumors represents one of the greatest unmet needs in oncology
research. The evolution of therapeutic resistance in cancer is a dynamic process, shaped by many external
forces, including selection pressures, microenvironment, and the timescales of clinical treatments. As tumors
evolve under these heterogeneous settings, a variety of genotypes emerge and lead to large differences in drug
response phenotypes between patients. By grouping tumors based on their response to treatment, we can
exploit principles of convergent evolution, where similar phenotypes evolve independently between individuals. In
doing so, this work aims to aid precision medicine by identifying commonalities between tumors with similar drug
response phenotypes.
 Gene expression signatures are a powerful tool that can be used to predict convergent states of drug sensitiv-
ity and resistance. Using vast open-source datasets, Aim 1 of this proposal will demonstrate a novel method for
extracting and validating gene expression signatures to predict therapeutic response in cancer. Cell lines with the
best and worst response to a given drug are pooled and compared using differential gene expression analysis.
Genes with increased expression in a state of sensitivity or resistance become seed genes in a co-expression
network based on gene expression from tumor samples. From there, only seed genes with strong co-expression
within patient samples are extracted to form the ﬁnal gene expression signature. This novel approach integrates
clinical sample data to the signature extraction method in order to increase translational value compared to molec-
ular signatures extracted using only cell line datasets. Next, Aim 2 of this proposal investigates the phenomenon
of collateral sensitivity, where resistance to one drug aligns with sensitivity to another drug. Because the evo-
lution of collateral resistance and sensitivity can be unpredictable, molecular signatures of convergent states of
collateral sensitivity and resistance could greatly enhance treatment planning once resistance to ﬁrst-line ther-
apy has evolved. Using EGFR+ non-small cell lung cancer cell lines as a model system, this project aims to
identify molecular signatures of evolutionarily convergent collateral sensitivity/resistance phenotypes during the
experimental evolution of therapeutic resistance to targeted therapies."
10767333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the past two decades, the rate of opioid use disorder (OUD) among pregnant women has more than
quadrupled, constituting a U.S. public health crisis. For affected women and their children, OUD presents a
unique set of healthcare challenges across a continuum of care, with most research on this population focused
on pregnancy and the birth hospitalization. However, within a primary care setting, there remains a lack of
rigorous research on how best to support mothers with OUD and their children given the complexity of their
medical and psychosocial care needs. The current paradigm of well child care (WCC) comprised of 15-minute
pediatric visits provides limited opportunity for building maternal trust, addressing information needs, and
engaging mothers as key participants in their child’s health.
 The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a comprehensive group model of WCC for
mothers with OUD and their children that is clinically tailored for opioid-exposed infants, is trauma informed,
and is embedded within a maternal OUD treatment program. As a novel alternative to routine care, group well
child visits consist of a 2-hour facilitated session with several mothers and their infants grouped together,
resulting in increased time with the pediatrician, peer-to-peer learning, and enhanced focus on behavior
change and self-care. All study procedures will occur at the Maternal Addiction Treatment Education &
Research (MATER) program at Thomas Jefferson University, which provides comprehensive medical and
behavioral health programming for pregnant and parenting women with OUD. In Aim 1, we will develop and
standardize a modular, manualized group-based well child care curriculum for this population, using an
iterative, qualitative process of feedback from patients and providers. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the
feasibility and acceptability of implementing group WCC within a maternal OUD treatment program. One
hundred and eight mother-infant dyads will be randomized to either group well child care or traditional well
child care, and studied over the first 18 months of life. Qualitative and quantitative data from patients and
treatment center staff will be collected. Finally in Aim 3, we will evaluate the efficacy of group WCC to improve
WCC utilization and experience and parenting knowledge and quality compared with traditional WCC.
 This project responds to AHRQ's special emphasis notice of interest for health services research on the
opioids crisis (NOT-HS-18-015) by addressing the experience and outcomes of women and children, AHRQ
priority populations. This project also responds to AHRQ’s interest in primary care innovations to address
social determinants of health (NOT-HS-19-011). Given the volume of children affected by maternal OUD who
incur higher risks of maladaptive parenting, intergenerational effects of trauma, and adverse health outcomes,
we anticipate this research will be of significant impact."
10750953,"The University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) proposes to increase the number of well-trained, highly qualified
neuroscientists from underrepresented populations. Accelerating the research training of students from
underrepresented ethnic/racial groups, students with disabilities, first generation students, and students from
lower income backgrounds is central to efforts to broaden participation and enhance inclusiveness in the
service of stronger science. UNR is the land grant university of Nevada, and is an R1 institution with a strong
tradition of educating students whose access to higher education historically has been limited. Our primary
partner and neighbor institution, Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC), is a Hispanic Serving
Institution with an outstanding record of preparing students to transition to upper level undergraduate education
at UNR. The proposed Nevada ENDURE program will facilitate an intensive two-year training program for 12-
14 trainees per year. During the academic year, trainees will conduct research and participate in weekly
professional development and skills training seminars at UNR. During each summer, trainees will participate in
summer research programs at our summer educational partner institutions: the University of California,
Berkeley, the University of California, Davis, the University of Michigan, and Stanford University. We propose
five activities: (1) To provide scientific skills and research experiences through placements with actively funded
neuroscientists, (2) To implement academic curriculum enhancement and professional development activities
to augment trainees' research activities, (3) To facilitate effective mentoring by program faculty, (4) To maintain
an effective Administrative Core to support trainees' development, evaluate program effectiveness, and
disseminate best practices, and (5) To expand the ENDURE network and pipeline of talented
underrepresented students to doctoral programs in neuroscience. Our measurable objectives during the
requested funding period include: (1) attainment of 85-90% admission to doctoral programs in neuroscience,
(2) improvement of trainees' research and quantitative skills, and (3) improvement in trainees' scientific writing
and presentation skills."
10752630,"Background: In real-world studies of geriatric and palliative care programs, policies, or treatments, treatment
initiation may need to be staggered across units in ways that are outside of investigators’ control. If differences
across cohorts or in organizational characteristics associated with both treatment timing and outcome are not
controlled for in analyses, they may obscure estimates of true treatment effects. Heterogeneous treatment
timing is inadequately addressed in most existing methods. Current methods to account for treatment effect
timing heterogeneity do not allow a treatment’s effect to be isolated from effects of confounders associated
with both timing and outcomes.
Significance: Staggered rollouts of policies and practice changes are common within VA — the timing at
which a new intervention (e.g., Veteran Directed Care) is rolled out cannot always be controlled.
Innovation and Impact: A potential solution involves inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) to adjust
for confounding across treatment groups defined by receipt timing, but IPTWs lead to biased estimates in
cross-sectional evaluations comparing multiple treatments. We have developed an alternative method, vector-
based kernel weighting (VBKW), that outperforms IPTW in cross-sectional evaluations. The degree to which
VBKW reduces bias and improves efficiency over IPTW in longitudinal applications has not yet been explored.
Entropy balancing (EB) weights also may produce unbiased and efficient treatment effect estimates when
combined with DD. Researchers need practical guidance for when weighting adjustments with DD may be a
superior analytic method to account for treatment timing heterogeneity in a difference-in-differences study, or
for when traditional two-way fixed effects (TWFE) approaches may be sufficient.
Specific Aims: We aim to compare bias and efficiency of estimates using VBKW, IPTW, EB, and TWFE
approaches in analyses of retrospective cohort studies with staggered treatment timing within a cohort (Aim 1)
and on data from longitudinal panel studies where treatment effects may vary across and within cohorts of data
collection (Aim 2). We will identify the degree of heterogeneity required for VBKW, IPTW, EB, and TWFE to
lead to different inferences (Aim 3).
Methodology: We will use Monte Carlo (MC) and plasmode simulations to evaluate bias, efficiency, covariate
balance, and processing time for each strategy in data obtained from observational studies with staggered
treatment timing. MC simulations on investigator-generated data (n=600, 900, 9600) will allow us to examine
the impact of different analytic scenarios (e.g., sample distribution across treatment timing groups, dynamic
effects) on the relative performance of estimators. Plasmode simulations will allow us to verify that our results
are robust to data generating process and will be derived from an observational analysis of Veterans’ self-
directed care services (using Corporate Data Warehouse data) and from the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS).
Next Steps/Implementation: We will identify when VBKW, EB, IPTW, or TWFE is superior for estimating the
effect of a treatment provided at different times and summarize our results in practical guidance that we will
share with the HSRD community. Our results will improve investigators’ ability to generate rigorous evidence
from studies of Veterans’ geriatric and palliative care in which treatment or event timing cannot be controlled."
10746417,"ABSTRACT
Surgical resection is a fixture in the treatment of intracranial tumors, and there is mounting data indicating
that overall and progression-free survival improve for gross total resection compared to subtotal
resection. The current standard of care for managing intracranial tumors relies heavily on MRI of
gadolinium-based contrast agents (Gd-MRI), which plays a central role in diagnosis, surgical planning,
intra-surgical guidance, and follow-up monitoring. During surgery, patients are spatially registered to the
pre-operative MRI and MRI-derived tumor contours projected over the visual field within the surgical
microscope to guide resection. Despite the widespread deployment of these sophisticated tools in
surgery, subtotal resection rates remain stubbornly high. The primary culprits include difficulty in
identifying tumor visually and the diminishing accuracy of the pre-op registration due to brain deformation
as the surgery progresses. In this context, expansive efforts have sought to alleviate these shortcomings,
including the use of intra-operative stereovision and/or ultrasound with brain deformation models to
update the pre-op MRI and the use of fluorescent agents to label tumor in the visual field. Although
promising, both of these approaches have known shortcomings. Specifically, the data sources used for
updating pre-op MRI are only surrogate correlates with MRI, and most current fluorescence guided
surgery (FGS) efforts focus on targeted agents designed to mark molecular features of tumor cells, which
have shown high intra-patient/tumoral heterogeneity. This project aims to solve both of these
shortcomings directly by leveraging the existing clinical understanding of Gd-MRI in managing intracranial
tumors. Specifically, we will identify and evaluate fluorescent agents that mimic the kinetic behavior of
conventional MRI-based contrast agents to guide intracranial tumor surgery. This approach will transfer
the well-understood behavior of Gd-MRI directly into the visual field, enable rapid, intra-surgical
administration of the agent, and provide an ideal data input for updating of pre-op MRI during surgery.
Our approach is premised on compelling preliminary data in small animal glioma models showing highly
correlative uptake between Gd-MRI and several untargeted optical agents. To advance this strategy we
will, (1) rigorously validate these results and examine additional optical agent candidates using MRI and
our custom hyperspectral whole-body imaging cryomacrotome, (2) establish concordance between
candidate optical agents and Gd-MRI in a new porcine glioma model using our intra-operative MRI facility
and FGS instruments, and (3) assess the capacity to use the optical agent data to update the pre-op
MRI. We will also quantitatively compare uptake of the candidate agents, Gd-MRI and ALA-PPIX, the
current standard for FGS of glioma. Completing the aims of this project will establish the optical analog
strategy as a compelling approach for surgical guidance and lay the groundwork for clinical translation."
10755660,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microbiota are associated with remarkable effects on host health and disease. Notably, discrete species of
commensal bacteria have been correlated with improved patient responses to cancer immunotherapy. However,
the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of these beneficial bacteria remain poorly understood. In
particular, specific strains of Enterococci have been linked with improved response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment
in patients with metastatic melanoma, lung, and kidney cancers, but their mechanism of action has not been
elucidated nor employed to improve cancer immunotherapy. Recent work from the Hang laboratory has
demonstrated that these beneficial strains of Enterococci have unique peptidoglycan composition and
remodeling enzymes. Based on these studies, this project hypothesizes that specific strains of Enterococci may
prime innate immune signaling pathways and enhance anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy against metastatic
cancers. To evaluate the activity and mechanism(s) of Enterococci during immunotherapy as well as co-opt their
protective factors for cancer immunotherapy, this proposal will examine how specific Enterococci strains alter
cancer growth, immune cell populations, and microbiota composition in mouse models of cancer immunotherapy.
In addition, the Hang laboratory will identify Enterococci protective factors and engineer them into existing human
probiotics to translate our basic microbiota-cancer immunotherapy findings into novel therapeutic agents. Finally,
the Hang laboratory will also synthesize novel immunomodulatory small molecules that activate host pathways
used by Enterococci to enhance cancer immunotherapy. These studies will reveal fundamental microbiota-
cancer immunotherapy mechanisms and develop new therapeutic strategies and agents to enhance cancer
immunotherapy."
10724265,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) resulting from blast exposure or non-blast incidents such as falls, sports inju-
ries, or motor vehicle accidents is prevalent in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom Vet-
erans. In addition, mTBIs represent the leading causes of brain injury in the general US population. Individuals
with a history of these brain injuries often report substantial difficulties understanding speech in noise despite
having normal peripheral hearing sensitivity. Research using behavioral central auditory processing measures
have established that Veterans and non-Veterans with a history of mTBI have binaural processing deficits that
likely impact speech understanding in complex listening environments. However, the behavioral measures
used in previous studies are unable to effectively tease apart how mTBI effects sensory or cognitive mecha-
nisms underlying impaired binaural processing abilities and how these deficits relate to speech understanding
in complex listening environments. This lack of knowledge severely limits our understanding of the neurophysi-
ological consequences of mTBI and impedes the development of effective, individualized clinical diagnosis and
treatment strategies for this patient population. The long-term goal of our research program is to develop tar-
geted auditory assessment and rehabilitation tools for individuals with brain injury who have substantial audi-
tory difficulties. Our specific objectives for this CDA-2 proposal are to identify the effects of mTBI on sensory
and cognitive processing mechanisms and to identify bottom-up and top-down neural coding deficits that are
predictive of speech understanding in complex listening environments in this clinical population. Specifically,
we aim to identify patterns of bottom-up sensory and top-down cognitive neural coding deficits from electro-
physiological measures designed to assess the neural encoding of binaural temporal cues and electrophysio-
logical measures designed to assess the cognitive modulation of cortical responses to binaural speech stimuli.
This proposal also aims to determine relationships between electrophysiological responses and behavioral
measures of speech understanding in complex listening environments. We hypothesize that some Veteran and
non-Veteran participants with mTBI will demonstrate degraded neural responses in electrophysiological
measures designed to assess the bottom-up neural encoding of binaural auditory cues and those that are de-
signed to assess the top-down cognitive modulation of cortical responses to speech. We further hypothesize
that a combination of these electrophysiological measures will best predict performance on behavioral
measures that assess speech understanding in complex listening environments and self-reported auditory diffi-
culties. The expected outcomes of this research proposal include a better understanding of effects of mTBI on
top-down sensory and bottom-up cognitive auditory processes that impact the perception of speech in noise.
These results will have a significant positive impact by identifying neural mechanisms that should be prioritized
in future studies that aim to further delineate the mechanistic and functional effects of mTBI. Together, this
work will provide strong evidence for processing mechanisms that should be targeted in future research on the
development of clinical auditory assessment and rehabilitation methods for civilians and Veterans with mTBI."

Frequent, accurate, and highly sensitive HIV-1 viral load monitoring is a critical component of AIDS antiretroviral
therapy, a tool for reducing the incidence of mother-to-child HIV transmission, and a required element of routine
diagnostic testing to make people aware of their HIV status. Although enormous research and product
development effort has been applied to point-of-care viral load testing, the current paradigm of nucleic acid tests
and antigen assays continues to demonstrate fundamental limitations that derive from their inherent complexity
and lack of robustness, which in turn impact their costs and practicality for adoption in resource-limited settings.
We seek to address an important gap in the capabilities of existing technologies through a combination of three
innovations to yield an integrated, rapid, simple, ultrasensitive, highly selective, robust, and inexpensive system
for quantitative viral load measurement. First, we utilize microfluidic separation of virions from whole blood,
yielding a 10-50 µl plasma sample from 20-100 µl of whole blood in <10 min, with >95% virus extraction
efficiency. Second, we will achieve ultraselective recognition of intact HIV virions from the resulting serum using
designer DNA nanostructures that take the form of a macromolecular “net” whose vertices are a precise
mechanical match to the spacing and positioning of the spike gp120 protein matrix displayed on the HIV outer
surface. The DNA net vertices incorporate nucleic acid aptamer probes that have been selected for selectively
targeting the HIV gp120, resulting in multiple sites of high affinity attachment, and thus the “net” can be used as
an effective capture probe when covalently attached to a photonic crystal biosensor surface. Finally, we will
utilize a newly-invented form of biosensor microscopy called Photonic Resonator Interference Scattering
Microscopy (PRISM) in which the photonic crystal surface amplifies laser light scattering from captured intact
virions, enabling each one to be counted with high signal-to-noise ratio. Because PRISM does not require labels
or enzymatic amplification, our approach enables dynamic, real-time counting of captured virus with digital
precision and ultrasensitivity. In the proposed project, we will integrate viral separation and the photonic crystal
biosensor into a plastic cartridge and develop a rapid workflow that will be simple and rapid for compatibility with
point-of-care settings, with the goal of yielding a result in <30 minutes sample-to-answer. Our Aims include
development of a point-of-care version of the PRISM instrument, and statistically robust characterization of
detection limits, repeatability, and robustness. Our study will conclude with validation of the system using clinical
specimens and direct comparison against gold-standard laboratory RT-PCR analysis."
10752641,"Background: In response to opioid-related harms and evidence supporting nonpharmacological treatments
(NPTs) for chronic pain, VHA has prioritized multimodal pain treatment approaches that include evidence-
based NPTs. However, NPTs are persistently underutilized, and Veteran-level barriers remain largely
unaddressed. OPTIONS (Options for Pain management using Nonpharmacological Strategies) is focused on
overcoming Veteran-level barriers to NPT use and adherence with 1) a decision aid to help patients
understand and compare NPT options and find NPTs that work best with their goals and lifestyle, and 2) a
coach who uses motivational interviewing to foster self-efficacy, prepare Veterans to discuss NPTs with their
providers, and build patients’ confidence to manage their pain with NPTs.
Significance: OPTIONS is directly responsive to HSR&D’s Opioid Solicitation by focusing on behavioral health
and engagement of Veterans in non-medication treatments. OPTIONS also supports the 2016 Comprehensive
Addiction and Recovery Act and numerous VA directives focused on increasing availability of NPTs.
Innovation/Impact: Despite mounting evidence on the effectiveness of NPTs, there is a distinct lack of research
aimed at overcoming patient-level barriers to NPT use. This is a critical gap that impedes pain management
and the goal of reducing reliance on opioids. OPTIONS is the first study to use a tailored, patient-centered
approach to address patient-level barriers to uptake of and adherence to NPTs. As such, OPTIONS provides
an important complement to VA’s system-wide efforts aimed at promoting NPTs and helps ensure that VA’s
substantial investment in these initiatives leads to increased use of NPTs and improved Veteran outcomes.
Our partnership with VA Pain Management and the Office of Patient-Centered Care and Cultural
Transformation will facilitate implementation of OPTIONS by leveraging existing Whole Health coaches if it is a
positive trial—further enhancing the impact of this proposal.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Test the OPTIONS intervention’s effects on pain interference (primary outcome) among
Veterans with chronic pain.
Aim 2: Test the OPTIONS intervention’s effects on NPT use and secondary outcomes (health-related quality of
life, psychological functioning, patient activation).
Aim 3: Identify facilitators and barriers to implementing the OPTIONS intervention.
Methodology: This Hybrid Type 1 study will test effectiveness while examining implementation facilitators and
barriers. 296 Veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain will be randomized to the intervention (10 weeks of
coaching using motivational interviewing and the OPTIONS decision aid on NPTs) or to a waitlist control arm.
We will examine outcomes at baseline and 3, 6 and 9 months. In Aim 3, we will use qualitative methods to
understand facilitators and barriers to future implementation via interviews with a subset of intervention
Veterans and with PCPs whose patients received the OPTIONS intervention.
Implementation/Next Steps: Pending positive results, our next step will be a multi-site hybrid type 2
effectiveness-implementation trial, in which we will evaluate for implementation while continuing to test for
effectiveness. We will work with our operational partners to implement the OPTIONS intervention using
existing Whole Health Coaches, thereby helping to ensure sustainability. In addition, findings from Aim 3,
which examines barriers and facilitators to implementation, will help to guide these next steps."

The Information Dissemination Core (IDC) will work closely with the
Leadership Administrative Core as an integrated resource with the
capacity to coordinate locally with other Cores and `Pepper Scholars' to
anticipate, process and distribute findings from Pilot/Exploratory,
Developmental, and ongoing External Projects at the Northwestern OAIC.
The IDC will utilize multiple novel approaches for information dissemination to
quickly establish a new Northwestern Pepper Center within our institution, the
great Chicago area, statewide and within the national Pepper Center network.
The Northwestern OAIC's IDC will be built upon a well-established and
innovative infrastructure supported by the Institute for Public Health and
Medicine (IPHAM). Dr. Ronald Ackermann, MD MPH serves as Director of IPHAM, and will also lead the IDC.
Two Centers within IPHAM will be leveraged for the timely outreach to large, diverse audiences: the Center for
Health Information Partnerships (Director, Abel Kho, MD; Co-Director, IDC) and Center for Community Health.
The overall goal of the IDC is to enhance translation of OAIC research findings into health care practice.
Therefore, IDC initiatives include ongoing, bi-directional communications with professional societies, private and
public organizations, health policy makers, and community resources. To share OAIC research findings, while
also continually learning from these broad audiences, our IDC specific aims are to:
Aim 1 Engage community & healthcare organizations at local, state, regional and national levels to elicit
 information needs, establish technology-enabled dissemination channels, and maintain a shared
 intellectual exchange on improving primary care for older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCC).
Aim 2 Assist Northwestern OAIC Cores and faculty participants in synthesizing research findings for a diverse
 set of stakeholders in preparation for dissemination.
Aim 3 Implement a multifaceted dissemination strategy leveraging new and existing mechanisms to inform lay
 and professional stakeholders on ways to improve health and function for older adults with MCC,
 emphasizing evidence-based approaches for primary care management.
Immediate outputs of this work will include a highly discoverable repository of a full collection of
traditional and non-traditional research products, coupled with a network of powerful relationships and
communication channels that will extend the usability and impact of OAIC research."

The Miller laboratory has been conducting research on the divergent nature of dopamine in neurons for over two
decades. Dopamine is an essential neurotransmitter/neuromodulator, but at the same time it represents a
potential source of endogenous toxicity. Data from our laboratory and others have clearly demonstrated that
improperly stored dopamine, via altered function of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) can induce
progressive nigrostriatal dopamine neurodegeneration that is strikingly similar to idiopathic Parkinson’s disease.
The synthesis, packaging, and degradation of dopamine (i.e. homeostasis) is thus tightly regulated to minimize
the potential for toxicity. In the previous funding period, the laboratory provided the first evidence that the synaptic
vesicle glycoprotein 2C (SV2C) was a key modulator of vesicular dopamine homeostasis. We demonstrated that
SV2C regulates synaptic dopamine release and its expression is altered in human Parkinson’s disease brain
tissue. In April, 2020 another laboratory identified SV2C in a large Parkinson’s disease GWAS firmly positioning
the protein as a key player in Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis. New preliminary data from our laboratory
indicate that SV2C can confer resistance to MPTP and that it prevents leakage of dopamine from the vesicle.
These data serve as the basis of our hypothesis that SV2C, through its ability to retain dopamine within synaptic
vesicles, confers resistance to dopamine neurotoxicity. We will test this hypothesis through the following specific
aims: Aim 1, to examine the mechanisms by which SV2C regulates vesicular dopamine homeostasis and
mediates toxicant-induced neurotoxicity. Aim 2, to determine whether introducing the evolutionarily advanced
SV2 proteins into the model organism C. elegans can confer protection against dopaminergic toxicity. Aim 3, to
determine the functional properties of SV2C in mice. Aim 4, to determine the role of SV2C in PD-related
pathogenesis (synuclein-based and toxicant-induced) in mice. Completion of the above specific aims will provide
critical information on the role of SV2C in dopamine neuron function, vulnerability to chemicals suspected in the
development of Parkinson’s disease, and its potential as a target of therapeutic intervention."

This revised application presents our vision for the “Atlanta Network for Training In KUH Scientific Research
(ATLANTIS)”. Our goal is to create a city-wide resource for training the next generation of researchers studying
KUH-related diseases. This program will establish new and strengthen existing collaborative research networks,
research training programs, and career development opportunities that will foster a sustained interest in KUH
diseases, thereby increasing the pipeline of these scientists into the biomedical workforce. The goals of
our program are to: 1) provide the intellectual and research platform to attract and train the next generation of
new basic and clinical scientists into KUH research fields; 2) promote impactful interdisciplinary and multi-
institutional collaborations with the shared objective of KUH-related human disease investigation; 3) promote
KUH biomedical investigator success by enhancing the career development of young scientists; 4) increase
research and teaching collaboration in Atlanta by promoting the interaction amongst Emory University, Georgia
Institute of Technology, Morehouse School of Medicine, and the Atlanta University Center colleges (including
Spelman College, Morehouse College, and Clark Atlanta University); and 5) increase the number of well-qualified
underrepresented minority students entering competitive careers in KUH research. The Administrative Core
will provide the infrastructure to unite scientists from these Atlanta institutions with a shared interest in KUH
research. The Administrative Core will manage educational and research opportunities to support researchers
to generate new knowledge leading to a long-term positive impact on clinical care in KUH-related diseases. The
Administrative Core will be responsible for the overall leadership, coordination, and management of the
ATLANTIS Program, including facilitating interactions among potential trainees and our rich base of preceptors
in KUH research, allocation and oversight of resources, reporting to stakeholders, and promoting the Program.
This will be accomplished by pursuing the following two Specific Aims: Aim 1. Provide oversight and direction,
monitor progress, and promote growth for all components of the ATLANTIS Program. Aim 2. Organize and host
one face-to-face meeting of all Institutional Network Award-supported programs in collaboration with the NIDDK.
The ATLANTIS Program seeks to provide resources to encourage trainees to enter into KUH research, and then
support their career success through the application of novel approaches toward training, professional
development, and networking. The goal of the ATLANTIS Administrative Core is to provide oversight to ensure
that these objectives are met."
10892981,"Recognizing that pre- and postdoctoral fellows (Ph.D. and M.D.) need a flexible and multi-disciplinary training
program, the ATLANTIS program is designed to promote individualized training of the next generation of KUH
researchers in the Atlanta area. As the Ph.D. and M.D. research workforce grows and the career landscape
changes, training and guidance in career planning are required for success. The Professional Development
Core, TL1 Training Core, and Network Core will collaboratively prepare trainees to develop their individualized
career training plan and the leadership skills necessary to lead their own future KUH research team (Aim 1). To
promote refinement of their career plans and development of the skills necessary for success, trainees will be
required to meet annually with career counselors and participate in career development activities. These
activities include formal training in biostatistics, communications (written, oral, and social media), grant writing,
and career planning. To lead future KUH research teams with members from diverse training backgrounds,
team management and executive leadership training are needed. Based on the NIGMS identified areas of
executive training needed for biomedical research, the Emory Office of Postdoctoral Education and Goizueta
Business School developed the STEM Leadership and STEM Team Management certificate courses that focus
on the development of leadership and team management skills. While scholars can take more, they will be
required to take a minimum of 10 workshop hours, choosing from any STEM certificate course (four in Year 2
and six in Year 3). Through ATLANTIS-Connect in the Network Core, trainees will gain experience in maintaining
a professional presence on social media and network success. While the research mentor is a key component
in trainee career planning, they may have limited formal training in effective mentoring or strategies to create a
conducive and supportive learning environment. To promote effective mentoring that addresses trainee needs
as they develop their individual research careers and become an independent KUH researcher, mentors will be
required to attend mentor training courses through the Atlanta Society of Mentors; Faculty Development Lecture
Series; training in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; and training in Preventing Sexual Harassment (Aim 2). To
promote an effective mentoring dialogue, the mentor and trainee are expected to develop a ‘contract’ that
includes research and professional development goals plus strategies and timelines for achieving those goals.
In summary, collaborative dynamic interactions between the TL1 Training Core, the Network Core, the
Professional Development Core, and research mentors, each scholar will have the freedom to shape and
individualize their research experiences as well as their opportunities for career and professional development.
With this background training, the ATLANTIS scholars (Ph.D. and M.D.) will be better prepared to navigate their
research careers as the research workforce grows and the career landscape changes as well as become better
KUH leaders, managers, and mentors, independent of their research setting."
10892983,"The ATLANTIS Network Core is structured to optimize Kidney, Urology, and Hematology (KUH) focused
research trainee success through technologically innovative and purposeful networking and interactions. A newly

community of established, emerging, and future KUH health researchers from Emory, Georgia Tech, Morehouse
School of Medicine, and the Atlanta metro region, including from the local Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCU). Our goal is to establish an environment conducive to cultivating a scientific community that
is able to effectively network, communicate, and collaborate across a variety of scientific settings using modern
communication tools. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims. The first aim will develop and
maintain a peer network providing an open forum for all trainees to interact, exchange ideas, and troubleshoot
scientific and professional issues. We will accomplish this through the deployment of the newly created digital
platform designed to foster peer and near-peer communication and provide opportunities for effective peer, near-
peer, and cascading mentorship experiences. The environment we will build will promote trainee-led production
of shared content and resources and will engage emerging KUH scientists in an innovative way designed to self-
sustain the ATLANTIS peer network. In the second aim, we will promote inter-disciplinary collaborations and
team science through existing events and newly planned activities by leveraging these existing and new
platforms to cultivate interest and increase visibility to KUH-mission focused research. The environment fostered
through these actions will support networked research communities thus presenting unique opportunities to
pursue novel research projects addressing KUH-mission areas using design-thinking approaches. For the third
aim, we will foster a robust research pipeline by developing community outreach programs to increase early
exposure to biomedical careers in KUH disciplines to high school and undergraduate students and promote
KUH-related research opportunities to trainees in undergraduate, graduate, medical school, and residency
programs. We will also invite emerging and aspiring scientists from diverse career pathways and backgrounds
at partner institutions, including through existing partnerships with Atlanta-area HBCU, to engage in ATLANTIS-
Connect thus providing them with support, near-peer mentoring, and career development resources. Trainees
in the ATLANTIS network will also serve as ambassadors to promote the merits and value of our networked
learning communities to peers in their training programs. Through these aims and objectives, the proposed
ATLANTIS Network Core will enhance engagement and training experience for KUH researchers across the
educational spectrum (high school to junior faculty). This will result in KUH trainees being better equipped to
collaborate, publish, communicate, and succeed in research-intensive and research-related careers, which will
be key to achieving success in growing this scientific workforce in generations to come."
10893000,"ABSTRACT – METHODS CORE
The ASPIRES Methods Core (MC) brings together investigators from diverse and complementary backgrounds
to collectively address design, implementation, methodological, and technological challenges that impede
progress toward effectively reducing the youth suicide rate. Our transdisciplinary team includes experts in
study design methodology for behavioral and population interventions, predictive analytics to improve clinical
decision making, development of digital health interventions, implementation science, qualitative methods,
integration of multi-level data elements representative of patient and community health, and geospatial
modeling of environment and social structure on population health. The MC capitalizes on substantial
institutional infrastructure and intellectual capital at both The Abigail Wexner Research Institute (AWRI) at
Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH) and The Ohio State University (OSU), and Co-Leaders Drs. Brock,
McAlearney, and Lin have each led both specialized and multidisciplinary teams with broad impact spanning
multiple areas of health. The MC will work with ASPIRES investigators to facilitate in a pediatric population 1)
development and testing of novel and scalable interventions and research-generated resources with significant
appeal for stakeholders; 2) rapid and widespread dissemination of new, effective practices; 3) continuous
improvement of suicide prevention interventions delivered in real-world settings; 4) interdisciplinary team
science to facilitate novel and convergent solutions to intractable suicide prevention challenges; and 5) training
of students, fellows, early career, and advanced investigators from diverse backgrounds to increase the
diversity of investigators conducting cutting-edge translational suicide prevention research. Our MC provides a
methodological anchor connecting all ASPIRES projects, and our transdisciplinary team with substantial
expertise, resources, and infrastructure at both NCH and OSU will ensure that all ASPIRES projects are
conducted with scientific rigor and broadly disseminated. Creative partnerships with the Zero Suicide Institute
and the OSU CCTS Pilot Project Program augment outreach, engagement, and dissemination. Methodological
and technological advances from our MC provide innovative approaches to overcoming challenges facing
behavioral interventions for reducing the youth suicide rate. Synergistic study design elements across
ASPIRES projects provide unique opportunities to study implementation and efficacy aspects of suicide
prevention interventions across primary, specialty, and acute care. Collectively, these developments support
innovative and rigorous evaluation of ASPIRES interventions and provide the groundwork for further design
and refinement of implementation strategies necessary to scale these interventions in future studies."
10893003,"Suicide is the second leading cause of death in those aged 10 to 19 years; it is a critical public health problem.
Suicidal ideation and nonfatal suicide attempts are even more prevalent and result in substantial morbidity and
increased risk of suicide. Pediatric primary care is an ideal service setting for intervention research designed to
rapidly reduce suicide and suicidal behaviors among US youth, as 80% of youth who die by suicide are seen
by their primary care clinicians (PCC) in the year prior to death while only 20% have contact with a mental
health professional. Despite the importance of identifying youth at risk for suicidal behavior, most PCCs do not
routinely screen for suicide.
 In recent years, new treatment and management strategies have been developed, tested and implemented
in some organizations, but they are not yet widely used. Existing clinical trials have tended to focus on testing
effectiveness of evidenced-based interventions (e.g., universal screening, safety planning) for high-risk
populations in emergency departments; less is known about the efficacy of these approaches in primary care
settings. Research is critically needed to test the effectiveness of evidence-informed practices to reduce
suicide risk for youth treated in primary care.
 To address this gap, we propose a stepped wedge hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized
controlled trial to test effectiveness of a population-based quality improvement (QI) intervention, Stepped
Approach to Reducing Suicide in Primary Care (STARRS_PC) that implements a clinical pathway for youth
identified by screening as being at elevated risk for suicide. The pathway is designed to promote the use of
evidence-based suicide clinical care processes and includes three separate components: suicide risk
screening, risk assessment and triage, and care management. The application builds on a pilot study of real-
world implementation of suicide risk screening into a pediatric primary care setting, using an iterative Plan, Do,
Study, Act (PDSA) quality improvement approach that was well-accepted by patients, families, and PCCs. In
the proposed study, we will test the effectiveness of STARRS-PC relative to treatment as usual (TAU) on
primary (suicidal attempts and suicide deaths), secondary outcomes (suicidal ideation, non-suicidal self-injury,
and family satisfaction) at 3, 6, 12 months post-baseline; examine clinicians’ knowledge, self-efficacy, and buy-
in regarding suicide risk screening, assessment, and management as mechanisms of change; and
organizational factors (e.g., organizational readiness and practice integrations) as potential moderators of the
treatment effect on patient outcomes During this five-year project, we will recruit and assess 2274 youth aged
12 to 17 years from 12 primary care sites, including 910 youths during the TAU phase and 1364 youths during
the Screening + Intervention phase. Participating sites serve vulnerable low-income youth in urban and rural
settings in central and southeastern Ohio."
10893004,"Project Summary/Abstract
Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death among U.S. children ages 5-11 years. From 2012-2017, youth
suicides increased at an alarming 14.7% annually. During this time, ER visits increased 92% among 5- to 18-
year-olds—to 1.12 million. Almost half of these visits involved a 5- to 11-year-old child. To date, however,
limited research on child suicide and suicidal behavior (SB) exists, and there are no empirically supported
prevention programs despite recognition by NIMH that youth suicide prevention should be a national priority.
One especially vulnerable group is children with a parental history of suicide attempts (PH+). PH+ children are
4-6x more likely to engage in SB than their peers and show especially early age of onset—often before age 10.
In this proposal, we target specific parent- and child-level vulnerabilities/risk factors for SB among these
families. Although suicide risk is heritable, existing research shows (1) effects of shared family environment on
SB and suicide, over-and-above genetic influences; and (2) specific family environment mechanisms that
contribute to SB and suicide. Such mechanisms include harsh, invalidating, and low-warmth parenting, as well
as impaired parent-child communication and poor parental monitoring of children’s behavior. These parenting
practices reinforce emotional lability and emotion dysregulation, which are common to both parents and
children in at-risk families. In our previous study (R21MH116206), PH+ children, ages 6-9 years, reported less
family cohesion, and PH+ parents reported more permissive parenting, which co-occurs with harshness,
hostility, and emotion dysregulation. Effective interventions that target these parenting practices and improve
parent and child emotion regulation (ER) may reduce risk for youth SB but have not been tested in PH+
families. We will compare a virtual version of Incredible Years® parent training (IY-PT) to Enhanced Usual Care
(EUC). IY-PT decreases parents’ emotional reactivity and teaches them to effectively “coach” their children on
successful ER. IY-PT is effective in increasing positive parenting and improving ER skills of both parents and
children, with large effect sizes that maintain at 1- and 2-year follow-ups. We will (1) test acceptability and
feasibility of virtual IY-PT for this population from both parent and clinician perspectives; (2) determine whether
IY-PT is effective in decreasing suicide risk among PH+ youth; and (3) explore acceptability and feasibility as
potential moderators between PH+ status and parent and child outcome. ER and parenting are primary
outcomes and NSSI, SI, and depressive symptoms are secondary outcomes. Measures include interviews,
direct observations, and self-reports. Participants include 100 PH+ families who will complete a baseline, be
randomized to virtual IY-PT or EUC, and complete 1-,3-, and 6-month reassessments post-intervention. This
effectiveness-implementation hybrid model design I, guided by PRISM Implementation Science Framework,
could have major implications for preventing an imminent public health concern among at-risk youth."
10757409,"Project Summary:
Arsenic contamination in the food chain is a global health problem and causes damage to most human organs.
A significant need exists to develop approaches for addressing environmental arsenic. The long term goal is to
develop a plant-based phytoremediation approach for contaminated land that is cost-effective and ecologically
friendly as an alternative to conventional remediation methods. The objective of this study is to develop a
genetics-based phytoremediation strategy for arsenic uptake, translocation, detoxification, and
hyperaccumulation into the fast-growing, high biomass, non-food crop Crambe abyssinica. Nanosulfur will be
utilized to modulate the bioavailability and phytoextraction of As from soil and to increase the storage capacity
via enhanced sulfur assimilation. The engineered Crambe will be evaluated for removing arsenic from the soil in
laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions. Our central hypothesis is that organ-specific expression of genes,
which control the transport, oxidation state, and binding of As, can be tuned to yield efficient extraction and
hyperaccumulation into above-ground plant tissues. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific
aims. 1) Genetically engineer Crambe abyssinica lines for co-expressing bacterial ArsC, gECS, and AtABCC1
and RNAi suppression of endogenous arsenate reductase CaACR2; 2) Evaluate the engineered Crambe lines
for metal(loids) tolerance and accumulation; 3) Synthesize and apply nanosulfur to modulate the bioavailability,
phytoextraction, and accumulation of toxic metal(loids); and 4) Conduct a pilot field study of engineered Crambe
lines for phytoextraction on a contaminated site. After initial screening in tissue culture media supplemented with
metals, the best performing quadruple gene stacked (ArcS+gECS+AtABCC1+CaACR2Ri) Crambe lines with wild
type controls will be tested using contaminated soils with arsenic as well as co-contaminants in greenhouse. A
pilot field-scale study will then be carried out at a site contaminated with arsenic. The soil will be extensively
characterized, and analysis for metal content and arsenic speciation will be determined using ICP/MS, HPLC-
ICP/MS as well as XANES (X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy). Last, soil amendments with engineered
nanosulfur will be used to evaluate the impacts on soil structure and contaminant availability and phytoextraction.
Nanosulfur will also be foliarly applied to plants to increase the metal storage capacity via enhanced sulfur
assimilation. The expected outcome of this project is a mechanistic understanding of the biogeochemical and
plant processes of arsenic remediation that connects key soil characteristics with the efficiency of phytoextraction
and hyperaccumulation of arsenic. The results will have an immediate and important positive impact because
the knowledge generated from this study will enable efficient and effective phytoremediation approaches to
minimize or remove arsenic contamination in the food chain and enhance public health."

Carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 gene are at a significantly increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Although numerous theories have been proposed, the cause of this association remains unclear.
My own research has uncovered novel effects of APOE4 expression on important processes in the brain,
including neuronal activity, the endosomal-lysosomal system and bioenergetic regulation. However, substantial
questions remain about when, where and how these systems are effected by differential APOE isoform
expression. In order to answer these questions and gain a more comprehensive understanding of how differential
APOE isoform expression affects vital brain processes and pathways, I propose a series of cutting-edge
experiments, performed on a newly created APOE mouse model. By conducting behavioral experiments,
histological examinations, imaging and an array of spatial multi-omics experiments, this project aims to define
the temporal, spatial and cellular progression of differential APOE isoform effects in the brain. Each of these
experiments will be performed on young (4-6 month-old), aged (14-16 month-old), and old (24-26 month-old)
APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4-KI mice. In Aim 1, we will conduct a series of behavioral tests, including Barnes
maze, novel object recognition, and fear conditioning, as well as a histological analysis for endosomal-lysosomal
disruptions, bioenergetic deficits, and changes in AD pathology markers. We will also conduct a detailed imaging
analysis using fMRI to observe activity and structural changes in these mice. In Aim 2, we will conduct an in-
depth spatial multi-omics analysis on these mice, including spatial transcriptomics and spatial
metabolomics/lipidomics. And in Aim 3, we will explore the cellular contributions to differential APOE isoform
expression, including a novel bioinformatics approach and conditionally knockout of APOE from astrocytes and
microglia in the APOE-KI mice. We anticipate that the full study proposed herein will uncover important APOE
isoform effects on multiple brain processes and pathways in a systems-biology manner, which will dramatically
increase our understanding of how APOE isoform differences affect an individual’s susceptibility to AD,
potentially leading to new therapeutic strategies for AD, especially among APOE4 carriers."

 Mutations in DDX3X are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and may
account for 1-3% of unexplained developmental delay (DD) in females, making this one of the
most common of neurodevelopmental disorders. DDX3X is considered a high confidence ASD
gene by SFARI gene. DDX3X encodes an RNA-binding protein of the DEAD-box helicase family.
While broadly implicated in mRNA metabolism, DDX3X is best characterized as a translational
regulator. Despite the robust link between DDX3X and ASD, virtually nothing is known about
DDX3X function in the developing brain nor the mechanisms by which DDX3X mutations perturb
cellular function. Further, it remains largely unknown how DDX3X impacts neural progenitors and
how it controls translation of its targets. This limits our understanding of the causes of ASD for
this common condition and the potential for therapeutic intervention. Our proposal addresses
these gaps by investigating how DDX3X mutations impair brain development and protein
synthesis. Our preliminary data indicates requirements for DDX3X in neural progenitors and
suggests that translational regulation may be relevant for disease. This has led to our central
hypothesis that DDX3X mutations impair neurogenesis by disrupting the progenitor cell cycle and
translation of key targets. To address this hypothesis we will: Define how DDX3X loss of function
impairs cell fate specification in mouse models, determine how DDX3X missense mutations
impair human neural progenitor function and differentiation, and identify the mechanism(s) by
which genetic variants in DDX3X alter protein synthesis. Our diverse scientific approaches enable
this multifaceted understanding of DDX3X function and developmental role. Upon completion of
this study we will gain fundamental insights into DDX3X biology and guide a framework for
therapeutic intervention."
10754500,"Impact of Home-Based High Intensity Interval Training on Resilience in Older Veterans
 More than 30% of U.S. Veterans 65 years or older are frail, which is three-times higher than in
non-Veterans in the same age group. Frailty is defined as an increased susceptibility to stressors resulting
from age-related impairments in adaptive biological systems, leading to higher risk of adverse outcomes
including falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Further, frailty prevalence increases with age,
affecting 50% of all adults 85 and over. Resilience, which is defined as the capacity to recover from
stress-induced disruptions to homeostasis, is critical to successful aging because it precedes frailty and
presents an opportunity to intervene on early health deficits, thus preventing aging-related decline in
health, function, and quality of life. Evidence-based therapies that enhance resilience in older adults are
limited and the complex biological and physiological mechanisms underlying resilience are not yet fully
understood. Consequently, Veterans seeking to boost their ability to recover from late-life stressors and
prevent frailty have few proven options. Our overarching aim is to characterize the complex factors
contributing to resilience and develop novel strategies that enhance resilience to boost healthspan in
older adults. Towards this end, our previous VA RR&D SPiRE Award allowed us to demonstrate the
feasibility of 12-weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) among older Veterans. We successfully
enrolled and retained older male and female Veterans and safely conducted individually tailored HIIT that
improved cardiorespiratory fitness, lower-body endurance, cognition, and quality of life. The purpose
of the proposed larger trial is to build upon our previous successes and develop and implement practical
HIIT regimens to reduce frailty and enhance resilience in older Veterans. We will conduct a randomized
controlled trial to ascertain the therapeutic benefits of 12-weeks of center- and home-based HIIT on
recovery and resilience among Veterans 60 years or older. We have identified a series of biomarkers of
resilience and are also seeking to examine key biological drivers of recovery at the molecular level. Our
proposed study will not only identify feasible methods to measure resilience in older Veterans but will
also assess the benefits of home-based HIIT on physical and cognitive performance, frailty, resilience,
and healthspan."

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder whose genetic contributions are
increasingly recognized. However, the vast majority of genetic research and discovery has occurred in
populations of European (EU) origin, significantly underrepresenting communities of color and those of self-
described African American (AA) ancestry. This disparity in genetics research, coupled with disparities in
diagnosis and treatment, motivated the investigators in this Network to take a major new direction in their
research, embarking on what has been a unique and highly successful recruitment of AA families with ASD
(AA-ASD) into gene discovery research at multiple sites, conducted phenotyping—including information of
critical relevance to the elucidation of race-based health disparities—while commencing genetic analysis to
identify ASD susceptibility genes. Via this collaborative effort, we aim to fill significant gaps in ASD research by
continuing to recruit and perform genetic research in this important population that has not previously been well
represented in ASD genetics research. Our Network involves seven research sites and a DCC, collaborating in
a systematic investigation of ASD genetics in order to identify rare mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, and
common variation contributing to ASD susceptibility in the AA population, while leveraging this unique
opportunity to understand and potentially remediate health disparities. Specifically, we will enrich existing
resources by recruiting at least 720 AA probands and additional family members to ascertain a cohort of at least
2000 probands in total. Our recruitment plan includes an embedded health disparities project that continues to
evaluate access and quality of care for AAs with ASD while increasing participation of AA individuals in genetic
research. We will conduct whole-genome sequencing (WGS), which permits comprehensive investigation of
genome-wide structural variation (SV) and coding and non-coding sequence variation (SNV) in ASD. We will
employ novel methods to define the ancestral origin of specific chromosomal segments and ascertain the
background on which susceptibility alleles occur and relate these features to quantitative phenotypes. In parallel,
gene expression profiling and network analysis will be used to prioritize variants. Genetic risk factors identified
in the mostly EU samples will be tested for association in the AA sample to determine whether these cohorts
share the same genetic risk factors, using a sample size providing power to replicate previous associations and
to identify rare, recurrent CNV and SNV. We will use local ancestry to boost power of polygenic risk scores
derived from EU cohorts. The observation of new forms or different population frequencies of ASD-related
variation in this sample as well as the sharing of most CNV and SNV with other cohorts are both outcomes that
will have great significance for future studies and for clinical care. As has been our practice, our Network will
make all phenotypic and genotype data accessible via the internet on a rolling basis, further enhancing the value
of this resource to the community."
10860926,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are a key component of cancer therapy, but they have unpredictable
treatment responses and considerable treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Factors such as patient
demographics, comorbidities, tumor types, genetic polymorphisms, and the gut microbiome may contribute to
interindividual variations in chemotherapy treatment response. Of these factors, the gut microbiome is most
amenable to manipulation to improve the efficacy and limit the toxicity of chemotherapy. However, the
mechanisms and extent to which the microbiota affects drug disposition, and thus efficacy, remain elusive.
 P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a key mammalian drug efflux transporter, plays a critical role in chemotherapeutic
treatment outcomes since it affects the pharmacokinetics of many cytotoxic agents and renders cancer cells
resistant to anticancer drugs. Preliminary results demonstrate that the prevalent human gut Actinobacterium
Eggerthella lenta inhibits P-gp function in mice, resulting in increased drug concentrations in the serum. In vitro
models with human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells replicated this in vivo finding and suggested that the P-gp
inhibition is mediated by a secreted bacterial metabolite. Furthermore, the P-gp inhibitor sensitized human CRC
cells against a P-gp substrate anticancer drug doxorubicin. Together, these findings provide a strong scientific
evidence to support the hypothesis that E. lenta secretes small molecule(s) that inhibit P-gp leading to increased
drug accumulation in the tumor and improved efficacy of doxorubicin anticancer therapy. This hypothesis will be
tested through 2 aims.
 P-gp inhibitor will be identified using comparative genomics, comparative metabolomics, and activity-
guided biochemical fractionations (Aim 1a). The mechanism and the transporter specificity will be investigated
with various in vitro methods (Aim 1b, 1c). The effect of E. lenta colonization on the efficacy and toxicity of
doxorubicin treatment will be evaluated in a mouse rectal tumor xenograft model (Aim 2). Results from these
aims will elucidate the mechanism of microbiome-transporter interactions that impacts cancer treatment
outcomes. These experiments will lay a strong foundation to use the candidate genes and metabolites as
prognostic biomarkers for treatment response and potential adjuvants to therapy.
 These research projects will be conducted at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), which
offers a unique combination of an exceptional microbiome research environment with a top-tier medical school.
These research goals, in combination with a comprehensive training plan from the UCSF Medical Scientist
Training Program, will be crucial to shaping the applicant's career as a physician-scientist."

Dr. Bryan Ward is an assistant professor in the department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at the
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he is dedicating his clinical practice to vestibular disorders, otology
and neurotology. He is seeking a mentored career development award in order to fill knowledge gaps in
imaging of the inner ear using MRI. His long-term goal is establishing an independent research program that is
devoted to using imaging to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with dizziness and imbalance. The
candidate proposes expanding on his prior work studying the physiologic effects of strong magnetic fields on
the inner ear vestibular system to imaging the fluid flow in the labyrinth of healthy chinchillas and humans. The
training plan immerses Dr. Ward in the multidisciplinary research and clinical environments in the departments
of radiology, neurology, biomedical engineering and otolaryngology at the Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine. Specific training goals include: (1) receive training in the physics of MRI and how images are
acquired, (2) complete training in MRI safety and performing prospective studies using imaging modalities, (3)
pursue additional training in the ethical and responsible conduct of research, and (4) integrate his clinical
training in vestibular disorders with this knowledge as he develops into an independent investigator.
High magnetic field MRIs can increase spatial and temporal resolution of images as a result of increased
signal-to-noise ratio; however, these MRI machines also cause dizziness and vertigo in humans. We
previously showed that all healthy humans have nystagmus in an MRI and hypothesized that this is due to a
Lorentz force occurring in the labyrinth. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) test the
hypothesis that a Lorentz force causes fluid flow that can be observed in vivo using phase contrast/flow
imaging in MRI, (2) to develop and implement a cost-effective countermeasure that minimizes the risk of vertigo
in high-strength MRI fields, and (3) to image the human labyrinth in 7T and 3T MRI combining anatomic
and flow imaging sequences. The study will involve chinchillas in aim 1 and the recruitment of healthy human
participants in aims 2 and 3. Completion of the proposed research plan will provide evidence for the cause of
dizziness in strong MRI, a low-cost method to mitigate the effects of dizziness in an MRI regardless of the
magnetic field strength, and support that improved MRI can provide higher resolution images of the labyrinth.
At the conclusion of this award, the candidate will be well-positioned to compete successfully for funding,
having acquired relevant knowledge and skills to become a leader in using high-strength MRI to identify new
vestibular pathophysiology and improve diagnosis of common conditions that cause dizziness and vertigo."

Idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial lung disease (ILD) of older adults characterized
by disruption of distal lung architecture that ultimately leads to scar formation, abnormal gas exchange, and
respiratory failure. A key barrier to developing better therapeutic outcomes for IPF has been a dearth of
translationally relevant preclinical models. Based on a recent paradigm shift wherein the concepts of repetitive
injury to a dysfunctional, vulnerable, alveolar epithelium coupled with an abnormal wound healing response are
postulated as disease “drivers”, new opportunities are emerging for therapeutic discovery in IPF. Mutations in
the alveolar type 2 cell (AT2) restricted, Surfactant Protein C [SP-C] gene [SFTPC], have been found in
sporadic and familial IPF and provide important clues for understanding IPF pathogenesis. To address the
unmet need for IPF patients, this proposal builds upon on a strong foundation of our prior work characterizing
the cell biology of SP-C biosynthesis that culminated in generation of two novel knock-in mouse models of
spontaneous lung fibrosis already in hand which express clinical SP-C mutants in AT2 cells in an allelic and
inducible fashion. Our Published Data has demonstrated that clinical IPF associated SFTPC mutations
produce aberrant SP-C proprotein isoforms that functionally segregate into 2 AT2 phenotypes: ER stress
induced by intracellular SP-C misfolding (BRICHOS) or autophagy/mitophagy impaired from proSP-C
mistrafficking to non-native organelles (Non-BRICHOS). When expressed in the lung epithelium in vivo, both
the non-BRICHOS mutant (SftpcI73T) and the BRICHOS mutant (SftpcC121G) are extremely toxic to the lung and
each is sufficient to evoke a time-dependent, physiologically restrictive peripheral fibrotic lung phenotype that
elaborates translationally relevant biomarkers reported in human IPF. This proposal will leverage these unique
models for Discovery, Target ID/ Validation, and Proof of Concept studies aimed at mapping cell
subpopulations and uncovering novel pathways driving lung fibrosis whilst providing a compelling translational
platform to interface with other preclinical/translational platforms in this U01 consortium to accelerate IPF
therapeutic development. In 3 specific aims, we propose to utilize Sftpc mutant mice to map cell populations,
transcriptomic profiles, and cell-cell crosstalk repertoires arising during evolution of spontaneous fibrotic lung
phenotypes [Specific Aim 1], identify novel disease relevant biomarker candidates elaborated during the
aberrant injury-repair process [Specific Aim 2], and assess the important contributions of and mechanisms by
which aging and sex impact IPF phenotypes [Specific Aim 3]. Importantly, many of the endpoints defined in
Sftpc models will be cross-validated and contextualized using lung tissue and serum from a well-phenotyped
human IPF biorepository. When completed, the impactful deliverables produced from this project will include a
new platform to better understand IPF pathogenesis from its onset through disease progression and serve as a
resource for the broader research community to identify and test novel therapies to treat this disease."

Regulation of microtubule organizing centers during mammalian gametogenesis
 Establishment of bipolar spindles during meiotic divisions ensures accurate chromosome segregation.
Characterization of microtubule organizing center (MTOC) dynamics will help understand causes of gamete
aneuploidy. The processes required for the formation of bipolar MTOCs are sexually dimorphic. Chromosome
segregation during spermatogenesis is mediated by MTOCs containing centrioles that duplicate once prior to
meiosis I and again prior to meiosis II. In contrast, oocytes form multiple acentriolar MTOC fragments that
coalesce together to form bipolar spindles.
 We have developed new research tools and adapted novel techniques to define and compare MTOC
processes between mammalian spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Aim 1 of our proposal focuses on determining
key regulators of centriole duplication. Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is known as the “master regulator” of centriole
duplication in mitotic cells. In addition, SAS4 is a key component of the centriole. However, very little is known
about the control of centriole duplication during gametogenesis. In Aim 1A, we use conditional knockout mouse
models to help determine the requirements for PLK4 and SAS4 during centriole duplication in spermatocytes.
Furthermore, we will use these models to address whether they have functions during oogenesis. In Aim 1B we
will discover the novel PLK4 interaction partners and phosphorylation targets that are critical for temporal
regulation of centriole duplication during spermatogenesis.
 The processes of centrosome maturation and separation required for bipolar spindle formation during meiosis
are mostly undefined. In Aim 2 we will assess key stages of centrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis.
PLK1 and Aurora A kinases have both been shown to regulate centrosome maturation in mitotically dividing cells
in an overlapping manner. However, their roles during meiosis, particularly relating to centrosome biogenesis,
are yet to be elucidated. In Aim 2A, we will use conditional knockout mouse models to discover the functions of
PLK1 and Aurora A kinases during gametogenesis, with focus on MTOC processes and chromosome
segregation. In Aim 2B we will determine how PLK1 regulates Aurora A kinase activity to avoid centriole
overduplication. We will also discover novel germ cell specific centrosomal components that are targeted by
PLK1 and Aurora A kinases to ensure proficient centrosome biogenesis.
 By defining the novel processes required for centrosome and acentriolar MTOC biogenesis during mammalian
meiosis we will develop new concepts of how meiotic chromosome dynamics and segregation are regulated.
Our proposed research will contribute to diagnosing causes of gamete aneuploidy and help with efforts to reduce
these events that cause birth defects, affect physical and mental development, and increase the risk of infertility."
10753543,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
By 2050, 42% of the older U.S. population will be racial/ethnic minorities. Older minorities bear a substantial
burden of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) and receive poorer quality of chronic disease management.
Patient-clinician communication barriers are important contributors to disparities in care and outcomes of MCC.
In particular, clinical visit communication about the context of people’s lives (i.e., contextual factors such as
medication use, dietary habits, fall risk and social support) optimally informs MCC management and is vital to
delivering patient-centered care. Yet, few patient-clinician communication interventions have included diverse
older adults with MCC, and most do not address the interactions of aging, MCC and contextual factors that
enhance or reduce health. A common scenario is the minority older adult with diabetes and concurrent
comorbid conditions. The burden of self-management tasks related to diabetes (e.g., checking glucose, taking
medications, adhering to diet) while simultaneously following care plans for other conditions can be
overwhelming, particularly when care plans do not account for the context of patients’ daily lived experiences.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to overcome disparities in patient-clinician communication among older
minorities with MCC by developing a patient-centered technology-based communication intervention called
Photo+Care. The premise of Photo+Care is that a picture is worth a thousand words, meaning that photos can
promote efficient information exchange and activate patients to communicate their lived experiences to their
clinicians, so they can develop patient-centered care plans together. Using smartphone cameras as a tool,
Photo+Care will elicit and integrate 4 contextual factors (medication use, dietary habits, fall risk and social
support) into primary care for older minority adults with MCC. Photo+Care will consist of a patient component,
comprising: 1) brief training on how to take photos using a smartphone; and 2) standardized, structured and
open-ended prompts to guide what kind of photos to take to describe 1 of the 4 contextual factors. The clinician
component includes brief training on: 1) how to respond to photos shared by patients; and 2) how to discuss
contextual factors elicited by the photos. The patient-clinician component is when patients briefly share select
photos with clinicians during a clinic visit. The career goal of the candidate, Dr. Jane Jih, is to be a leader in the
national mission to achieve health equity and a research expert on health disparities among older adults. Her
short-term goals are to gain additional skills necessary to develop and test patient-centered interventions that
improve outcomes for multiethnic and linguistically diverse older adults. To support her career development,
Dr. Jih has assembled an exceptional multidisciplinary mentoring team including Dr. Christine Ritchie, a
geriatrician with MCC expertise and Dr. Tung Nguyen, a national leader in Asian American health. This award
will advance knowledge of patient-centered approaches to enhance the care of older adults, and allow Dr. Jih
to receive additional training to become a leader in disparities and aging research."

Harboring active transposable elements (TEs) imposes a substantial mutational burden on the host genome. To
reduce this burden, most organisms have evolved sophisticated, and often multi-layered, mechanisms for
identifying and inactivating TEs. In spite of these defenses, active TEs are found in the genomes of almost all
eukaryotes. One explanation for the evolutionary persistence of TEs is that they are in an “arms race” with their
host genome: TEs are constantly evolving novels ways to block or evade host silencing while the host genome
is continuously evolving to re-establish TE suppression. While this theory is appealing, there is a gap in
knowledge because the mechanisms by which TEs could block or evade host defenses are largely unknown.
The long-term goal of this applicant’s laboratory is to understand the evolutionary dynamics of TE/host co-
evolution. The overall objective of this project is to understand and functionally validate a novel TE strategy,
discovered in the applicant’s laboratory, that involves TEs using their own piRNAs to target host silencing factors
for suppression. Preliminary data produced in the applicant’s laboratory suggests that the Drosophila
melanogaster telomeric transposon TART-A captured a portion of the host TE silencing factor nxf2, which allows
TART-A to produce piRNAs targeting nxf2 for suppression. The rationale for the proposed research is that it will
provide critical insight into the mechanisms of host-TE conflict and how TE counter-defense strategies can
impact host gene expression and fitness. The objective of this project will be achieved by pursuing three specific
aims: 1) Identify genes acquired by telomeric TEs across Drosophila; 2) Determine whether non-telomeric
transposons also use a piRNA-mediated counter-silencing strategy; and 3) Disrupt TE counter-silencing using
CRISPR in D. melanogaster. Telomeric TEs will be identified in 28 species of Drosophila and assayed to
determine whether they have acquired host gene fragments. The applicant’s laboratory has identified 45
candidate genes in D. melanogaster that share homology with TE-derived piRNAs and are known to play a role
in TE suppression. These genes will be tested to determine if they suppress the same TE with which they share
homology. Candidate TE/gene pairs will be validated using CRISPR genome editing to erase their shared
homology, which should result in upregulation of the gene in question. The proposed research is innovative
because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo: instead of the host-centric view of previous
studies, which examine how the genome responds to TE activity, this project will study the TE side of the equation
by investigating how TEs respond to and counteract host defenses. One of the major goals of the field is to
understand why host genes involved in TE silencing are rapidly evolving. The proposed research is significant
because it will support this goal by characterizing and functionally validating a specific TE counter-defense
strategy, which will provide empirical support for the arms race theory, while also increasing understanding of
the co-evolutionary dynamics between host genomes and their TE associates."
10758531,"With advances in healthcare and effective public health campaigns, the survival rate after cardiac arrest (CA)
has more than doubled during the last decade. However, as highlighted by a scientific statement from the
American Heart Association in 2020, CA patients remain at markedly elevated risk for poor long-term recovery
after leaving the hospital. We have shown that the experience of CA can be a psychologically distressing event
that induces depressive and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in >30% of patients. Further,
these symptoms were associated with a tripling of risk for secondary cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
mortality risk in our prior work. Despite a growing interest in conducting psychological interventions, there is
no reliable method for preventing negative psychological factors (NPF) after acute cardiac events. Critically,
modifiable positive psychological factors (PPF) are associated with improved quality of life (QoL), greater
independence in activities of daily living (ADL), healthier behaviors, improved (higher) cardiac vagal control,
fewer adverse cardiovascular events, and lower risk of dying in CVD patients. The most promising PPF in this
regard are a sense of optimism, experiences of positive affect, and a belief that one’s life has purpose even in
the face of the depression and distress that often follow serious cardiac events. It is unknown whether CA
survivors may benefit from PPF in the same way as other CVD patients seem to do. Although the rates of
elevated NPF are even higher in patients after CA than in patients after heart attack and stroke, many CA
survivors actually report a positive attitude and a belief that they have a fortuitous opportunity for “a second
chance at life.” The first aim of the study is to test whether PPF and NPF are associated with the measures of
recovery that are most important to patients’ everyday lives—QoL and ADL—in the year after the CA in a
racially and ethnically diverse sample of CA survivors. The second aim is to test whether PPF and NPF are
associated with a potential behavioral mechanism underlying recovery: changes in physical activity in the first
6 months after the CA. The third aim is to determine the demographic and medical factors that predict who
develops PPF and NPF after CA. We will enroll a cohort of 228 CA patients from the intensive care units (ICU)
of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. We will assess patients’ PPF and NPF at hospital discharge (median 21 days
post-CA). We will conduct follow-up assessments by phone at 3, 6, and 12 months after the CA. In the week
immediately following hospital discharge and again 6 months later, we will monitor physical activity via wrist-
worn actigraphy, daily positive and negative affect using mobile ecological momentary assessment, and cardiac
vagal control via a chest patch. CA accounts for more than half of all cardiac deaths, and is the third leading
cause of death and disability in the US. Malleable PPF and NPF may be targets for improving QoL and
returning CA survivors to independent lives. This study will be the first to test the potentially cardioprotective
PPF and the potentially harmful NPF to investigate how long-term recovery after CA may be improved."
10757712,"The mechanisms driving progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) remain enigmatic. Progression of MS correlates with the
expression of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in cerebrospinal fluid of patients, suggesting that TNF plays a
key role in the disease process. Thus, targeting TNF was suggested as an attractive therapy for MS. Surprisingly, however,
TNF-blocking drugs with proven efficacy in other autoimmune diseases triggered onset and exacerbations of MS, which
provided evidence that TNF can also contribute to CNS protection and repair. Subsequent work showed that pathogenic
TNF effects in EAE are mediated via TNF receptor (TNFR) 1, whereas TNFR2 signaling ameliorates disease and reduces
demyelination. TNFR2 is expressed by different cell types in the CNS, including microglia and oligodendrocytes, and its
expression by these cells can promote repair and remyelination. Likewise, astrocytes can express TNFR2, but the role of
TNFR2 expressed by astrocytes for MS/EAE progression remains unresolved. Astrocytes with pathogenic (A1) or
neuroprotective/anti-inflammatory properties (A2) have been described; however, the mechanisms orchestrating
detrimental versus beneficial astrocyte functions are still not fully understood. We have obtained exciting preliminary
results supporting a central role for astrocyte TNFR2 in curtailing EAE progression by investigating the role of
TNFR2 in a “humanized” transgenic mouse model expressing the human MS-associated MHC II allele HLA-DR2b and
lacking the expression of TNFR2 molecules, herein called DR2bΔR2 mice. This model provided evidence that the HLA-
DR2b molecule favored Th17 development, while impairing Foxp3+ Treg cell formation. Importantly, we observed that
DR2bΔR2 mice developed progressive EAE and astrogliosis when CNS resident cells were TNFR2 deficient.
Moreover, in DR2bΔR2 animals with EAE, astrocytes showed increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
increased expression of CXCR5. Additionally, CXCL13 was upregulated in the CNS of these mice in line with previous
reports that CNS expression of CXCL13 aggravates EAE and promotes chronic white matter lesions that is not
dependent on recruitment of CXCR5+ leukocytes from the periphery, and that CXCL13 expressed by damaged neurons can
activate astrocytes. Moreover, we observed a striking dichotomy in the expression of TNFR2 between astrocyte populations
in DR2b mice with EAE, suggesting that TNFR2 expression may favor astrocyte A2 versus A1 subpopulations. Thus,
our proposal will test the central hypothesis that TNFR2 signaling in astrocytes curtails progression of neuroinflammation
by restraining pathogenic and promoting protective astrocyte functions. We will test our hypothesis by (1) determining the
role of TNFR2 for curtailing pathogenic astrocyte effector functions and preventing EAE progression; and (2) determining
the role of TNFR2-regulated CXCL13/CXCR5 signaling for chronic astrocyte activation and function in progressive EAE
in DR2bΔR2 mice. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal by applying innovative new approaches including
our progressive EAE model, developing astrocyte-specific TNFR2 and CXCR5 knockout mice, and innovative
immunological and molecular biological methods, including single-cell RNA-seq and RNAScope."
10757000,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Voice disorders are among the most common communication disorders across the lifespan. Approximately 3-
9% of the general population, including children and adults, have a voice problem at any given point in time. Our
ultimate aim is the permanent repair of injured, altered or dysfunctional vocal fold tissue using injected or printed
biomaterials for lesion-specific application. Much previous work on injectable biomaterials for VF repair has
targeted sub-epithelial injections through a needle. Such delivery method is useful for the surgical treatment of
pathologies allowing needle injection into the native LP, or into the muscle for VF medialization. We have
developed composite bioactive tissue-engineered biomaterials, namely glycol-chitosan (GCS) hydrogels with
imbedded collagen fibers (COL I+III. Within the past year, our group has refined the composition of the GCS
hydrogel to a highly porous viscoelastic hydrogel (PVH). The increased porosity of PVH is expected to enhance
infiltration and survival of host cells and thus accelerate endogenous tissue regeneration. We have completed a
series of in vitro experiments using an injectable form of PVH.
We propose to build novel bioprinting tools that can deliver biomaterials to dress wounds on site. When large
lesions such as cancer are surgically removed using cold knifes or lasers, large voids are created possibly all
the way through the LP, down to the muscle. Novel materials that cure, adhere and seal quickly in situ will be
developed to prevent being dislodged and ingested into the airway. We propose a fast polymerization material,
PVH-prt, that cures in seconds, as opposed to minutes, and that can be printed on site through a laryngoscope
using needle-sized nozzles. On-site layer-by-layer deposition and sculpting would rebuild the resected portion
of the VF using new materials that are mechanically tough, with high adhesive strength, and that solidify quickly.
We will investigate strategies to lay such implants using additive manufacturing tools that are based on
microfluidics. We will test custom-made endoscopic size surgical “3D printing pens” using ex vivo larynges and
VF replicas. We will perform pilot studies of this novel concept in vivo using an animal model.
We will evaluate our biomaterials in rabbits. Foreign body response, tissue viscoelasticity and phonatory
functions will be evaluated with histology, mechanical tests and flow-bench experiments, respectively. To
complement the known limitations of animal studies and build on previous studies, a phonomimetic bioreactor
will be used to systematically vary scaffold properties, types and phonation conditions, and assess the
mechanical characteristics of the engineered lamina propria. Our overarching goal is to translate these new
biomaterials and bioprinting tools into otolaryngology clinics in the United States and Canada within the next 5
years."
10894139,"Project Summary – Overall
 Bone marrow produces blood cells whose functions range from oxygen delivery to anti-microbial defense to
hemostasis, all originating from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). To sustain and regulate this process, bone
marrow stromal cells form multiple niche microenvironments, each tailored to the needs of a particular developing
blood cell population. Using highly-multiplexed imaging technologies, our proposed Bone Marrow Tissue
Mapping Center (TMC) aims to systematically and quantitatively dissect the cellular composition and spatial
organization of human bone marrow microenvironments. The resulting detailed maps will serve as an open and
global platform for understanding which cells and interactions are critical for each branch of hematopoietic
maturation, and how these vary by anatomical site and across diverse patient demographics.
 The TMC will define cellular identities and cell states at the transcriptional, translational, and post-
translational levels using Nanostring DSP, Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), and MALDI-MSI, which
generate quantitative spatial maps of RNA, protein, and N-glycans, respectively. Our cross-disciplinary team not
only includes the inventors of MIBI and a pioneer of MALDI-MSI, but also experts in human HSCs and human
hematopoiesis and a practicing hematopathologist with expertise in histopathologic bone marrow diagnosis. To
overcome the unique challenges of working with hard, mineralized bone, we will leverage parallel, robust,
clinically-validated bone marrow processing pipelines which maximize and standardize sample quality and
compatibility with current and future technologies. Integrating seamlessly into standard clinical workflows, our
pipelines enable convenient sharing of prospectively-collected materials with the Tissue Core. Samples will be
collected from three different sources: (1) prospective, patient-matched multi-site collection from deceased
donors to examine differences between anatomical sites, (2) prospective collection of femoral head from hip
arthroplasty specimens for differences between age ranges, (3) iliac crest bone in the Stanford Pathology archive
for differences between races and genders. These multiple collection strategies, multiple sites, and different
investigational focuses complement prior HuBMAP projects. The Data Analysis Core team has pioneered
multiple novel data processing pipelines, including pixel-based analyses, cell-based analyses including state-of-
the-art cell segmentation and cell clustering and enumeration, and neighborhood analyses. These tools are
broadly-applicable to all highly-multiplexed quantitative imaging technologies. Overall, our team and strategy are
exceedingly well-suited for executing the vision of the proposed Bone Marrow TMC.
 The spatial structure of bone marrow reflects the evolutionary mechanisms that terraformed bone to create
unique microenvironments meeting the nutritional needs of developing blood cells with divergent functions. The
interdependence between bone marrow tissue structure and hematopoiesis is informative not just in blood cell
maturation, but for understanding metabolism, aging, and development of cellular therapies."
10744733,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Suboptimal nutrition is the leading risk factor for death and disability worldwide and accounts for accounts
for more than 45% of cardiovascular death in the US. Dietary risks affect people regardless of age, sex, and
sociodemographic development. However, studies investigating the cardiovascular consequences of suboptimal
diet in premenopausal women remain scarce. Notably, although compelling recent evidence indicates that
women of reproductive age are more salt sensitive and prone to obesity-associated cardiovascular disease
(CVD) than men, the mechanisms whereby excess salt consumption and obesity negate the premenopausal
advantage for hypertension remain unknown. In preliminary data for this application, we provide new evidence
involving the steroid hormone progesterone, the adipokine leptin, as well as the “adrenal-aldosterone –
endothelium-mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) axis” in both salt sensitivity and obesity related-CVD in
premenopausal women. We identified for the first time a mouse model of endogenous salt sensitivity, the Balb/C
mouse, which reproduces the human phenotype and exhibits a higher salt-sensitivity in females than males. We
provide data presenting lack of aldosterone suppression, MR overactivation and increased adrenal leptin
receptor expression as potential contributors to the sex-specific elevation in blood pressure in females fed a high
salt diet. Concomitantly, we identified leptin as a new direct regulator of adrenal-aldosterone production and
presented leptin-mediated aldosterone production and MR activation as major contributors to obesity-associated
vascular dysfunction and hypertension in females. Subsequently, we show that arteries from females are more
prone to aldosterone-mediated endothelial dysfunction than that of males and that both women and female mice
exhibit higher expression of the endothelial MR (ECMR) than men and male animals. Remarkably, we found that
endothelial progesterone receptor activation upregulates ECMR in females. Lastly, we show that salt sensitive
female Balb/C mice have a 3-fold higher expression of ECMR than female mice on the C57Bl/6 background,
which are known to be salt-resistant. Taken together, these exciting and novel findings inform the core hypothesis
of this proposal: Progesterone-induced ECMR expression and leptin-mediated adrenal aldosterone production
cooperate to abolish the protective effects of female sex hormones and predispose females of reproductive age
to diet-associated CVD. We will test this hypothesis in three aims. In aim 1 we will investigate the specific
contribution of adrenal leptin receptor to salt and obesity associated CVD, while in Aim 2 we will determine
whether progesterone contributes to salt and obesity-associated CVD via increasing ECMR expression. Finally,
in Aim 3, we will investigate using discarded human tissues whether differences in ECMR levels are responsible
for sex, strain and racial differences in salt-sensitivity via increasing endothelial ENaCα activity. We anticipate
that this proposal will lead to the identification of mechanisms predisposing premenopausal women to diet-
associated CVD and open new avenues for treatment."

The small bowel and colon are organs critical for maintaining homeostasis of the human body by
mediating nutritional absorption upon the ingestion of food. Though both organs are extensive in
length, there are known differences in function and cellular heterogeneity within different portions
of each. Also, a cross section anywhere in the bowel reveals a complex layering of components
involved in absorption and secretion, motility of gut contents, circulation, and immunity. In this
submission, we propose to continue our efforts in the Stanford Tissue Mapping Center (TMC) to
produce multi-modal, three-dimensional single-cell resolution maps of the small bowel and colonic
wall structure. This will serve as a community resource to further study intestinal function and
disease. We will collect tissues from deceased organ donors with explicit consent for distribution
among the HuBMAP consortium and broad access genome data sharing (GDS). Three sets of
technologies will then be employed. Tissue samples will be subjected to single-nuclei ATAC-seq
and RNA-seq. These open chromatin and transcriptomic profiles will be spatially mapped to tissue
sections using the CODEX (CO-Detection by indEXing) multiplexed spatial immunoassay. We will
also employ the Molecular Cartography multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

dimensional maps will span all layers of the bowel wall and include the epithelial, enteroendocrine,
vascular, lymphatic, nervous, immune, and muscular cell populations that contribute to normal

10746389,"Human malignant melanoma is an aggressive cancer with high propensity for metastatic dissemination.
Despite recent advances in melanoma therapy, most patients with metastatic disease do not experience
durable benefit from current treatment options. Indeed, existing targeted and cancer immunotherapeutic
modalities do not directly inhibit tumor metastasis, which accounts for most cancer-related deaths. Accordingly,
the development of new agents that specifically target pro-metastatic pathways intrinsic to melanoma cells
could greatly improve treatment outcomes and reduce off-target toxicities. The trafficking processes observed
in disseminating metastatic cancers resemble, at least in part, the leukocyte homing paradigm, a sequential
multistep adhesive cascade involving cell tethering and rolling on microvascular endothelium, followed by
integrin-mediated arrest and transendothelial migration into secondary tissues. Leukocyte homing is dependent
on specialized integrin heterodimers and their cognate ligands on endothelial cells. To date, however,
expression of these distinct leukocytic homing integrin subsets has not been described in melanoma. Our
preliminary studies demonstrate, for the first time, aberrant expression of integrin heterodimers, conventionally
thought to be restricted to leukocytes, by melanoma cell subsets with high metastatic capacity. In patient
primary melanomas, cancer cell-intrinsic integrin positivity correlated with sentinel lymph node metastases.
Melanoma-specific inhibition of these integrin heterodimers suppressed endothelial adhesion and significantly
blocked growth and metastasis formation in preclinical mouse models of human melanoma. These paradigm-
shifting findings identify leukocytic homing integrins as novel mediators of tumor cell dissemination.
 While hematopoietic integrin targeting approaches, including humanized antibodies, have already been
developed for the treatment of patients with inflammatory and autoimmune leukocyte trafficking disorders, they
have never been examined in the context of cancer. In this proposal, we newly investigate the therapeutic
utility of these validated and readily available integrin inhibitors in blocking metastatic dissemination in
preclinical melanoma models. Our specific aims are to 1) dissect mechanisms of melanoma cell-intrinsic
homing integrin induction and functional activation, and define integrin glycosylation states and heterodimer
composition in patient tumor biospecimens at various stages of progression, and 2) examine the therapeutic
efficacy of CRISPR/Cas-9-mediated leukocytic integrin knockout or clinical-grade integrin inhibitors originally
formulated for the treatment of immune trafficking disorders, in preclinical melanoma models. We have
assembled a team of experts in the melanoma metastasis, leukocyte homing, gene editing, dermatopathology,
and glycobiology fields, to bring to fruition the translationally relevant aims of this proposal. Results from our
studies could establish melanoma cell-expressed leukocytic integrins and their glycostructural determinants as
novel therapeutic targets for selective inhibition of metastatic dissemination."
10745297,"Comparisons of genetic mutations found in primary tumors and their corresponding metastatic lesions have
so far failed to define genetic mutations that lead to metastasis. This raises a notion that it is the epigenetic
mechanisms, working together with cancer type-specific oncogenic and/or cell type-specific lineage programs,
that may drive metastatic progression. In breast cancer, how epigenetic abnormalities drive metastatic
progression remains largely elusive. A better understanding of this may lead to novel strategies to block
breast cancer metastasis. LSD1 (KDM1A) is the first identified histone demethylase. In human cancers,
genetic abnormalities of LSD1 mainly include deletions and mutations. Such deletions/mutations have also
been found in metastatic breast cancer, raising a possibility that LSD1 is a breast cancer metastasis
suppressor. Indeed, in preliminary studies, we found induced loss of LSD1 in luminal mammary tumor cells
or LSD1 inhibitor treatment in the MMTV-PyMT mouse model led to a dramatic increase in lung metastasis.
Mechanistically, in luminal breast cells, we found LSD1 interacts with GATA3, a key luminal-specific
transcription factor, to control their common programs related to cell-cell adhesion and cell cycle. LSD1
positively regulates GATA3 expression and represses that of TRIM37, a common target of both LSD1 and
GATA3, which encodes a histone H2A ubiquitin ligase involved in gene repression. Importantly, TRIM37 may
contribute to increased invasion and migration of luminal breast cancer cells with LSD1-loss via repression of
several cell adhesion genes (e.g., CDH1, VCL, CTNNA1). Such expression changes were also observed in
murine PyMT tumor cells with LSD1-loss. Together, these data suggest that LSD1 may suppress breast
cancer metastasis via regulation of its target genes (e.g., TRIM37) in luminal cells in a demethylase activity-
dependent manner. Intriguingly, PyMT tumor cells with LSD1 ablation also exhibited a profound change in
immune-related genes, suggesting that LSD1 may also suppress breast cancer metastasis by a cell-extrinsic,
immune-related mechanism. To test these, we will continue to establish mouse intraductal injection (MIND)
transplantation models for PyMT tumor cells and human estrogen receptor+ breast cancer cell lines as our in
vivo system. In Aim 1, we will perform CRISPR-based screens to map functional domain(s) of LSD1
responsible for its metastasis suppression vs. proliferation/survival-supporting roles, and test if LSD1
mutations found in patients impair its metastasis suppression function via disruption of the demethylase
activity. In Aim 2, we will determine roles of LSD1 targets (e.g., TRIM37 and its partner EZH2, and others) of
luminal cells at different steps of the metastatic cascade in various MIND models. In Aim 3, we will determine
the immune mechanism mediating increased PyMT metastasis associated with LSD1 ablation, in particular,
NK cells and MHC-I molecules, as LSD1-loss in PyMT tumor cells led to a profound upregulation of various
classic and non-classic MHC-Is, which serve as ligands for inhibitory receptors in NK cells."
10741768,"Project Summary / Abstract
This is an application by Dr. Daniel Lingwood (PI), and Dr. Alejandro Balazs (Co-I), Assistant Professors at
Harvard Medical School and faculty members of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard. Their
laboratories specialize in defining the immunology of antibody responses to vaccines (Lingwood) and in the
engineering of immunity through AAV-mediated gene delivery (Balazs). Dr. Lingwood has discovered that
antibody responses to vaccination, and pro-inflammatory immune reactions generally, are centrally regulated
by novel control axis supplied by conventional dendritic cells (cDC), a single lymphoid lineage defined in mice
by expression of the transcription factor Zbtbt46. Dr. Lingwood has found that cDCs are responsible for the in
vivo biogenesis of the soluble, circulating form of the IL-6 receptor (sIL6R), which normally captures IL-6 from
solution to systemically coordinate its signaling activity. IL-6 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine released
following immune challenge or tissue injury, and dysregulation of its capture by sIL6R leads to
hyperphysiologic IL-6 levels and inflammatory disease. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that
biogenesis of sIL6R by cDC forms a centralized control axis that can be modulated to enhance immune
defense and restore IL-6 homoeostasis in disease states. In Aim 1, Dr. Lingwood will define the contribution of
the metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 to systemic sIL6R release from the cDC cell surface. These
proteases cleave surface IL6R to shed sIL6R from tissue culture cells lines, potentiating a drugable target to
modulate IL-6 immune effects. However, ADAM10/17 knockouts are embryonic lethal, preventing mechanistic
evaluation of their activity in vivo. Dr. Lingwood has now selectively directed ADAM10 and/or ADAM17
knockouts to the cDC lineage and will use these transgenic animals to define ADAM activity within two cDC-
dependent parameters: circulating sIL6R set-point and induction of sIL6R biogenesis after immune challenge.
Dr. Lingwood has also discovered that cDC-derived sIL6R, and subsequent trans IL-6 signaling through the
sIL6R:IL-6 complex, is necessary for B cell differentiation to antibody secreting plasma cells, and tunes
antibody output following immunization with a variety of protein vaccine antigens. In Aim 2, Dr. Lingwood will
define how cDC-derived sIL6R links innate and adaptive immunity through this pathway (outside the traditional
T cell priming activity of cDC), and more specifically how this can be harnessed as a natural adjuvant principle
to improve the efficacy of influenza vaccines. In Aim 3, Dr. Lingwood and Dr. Balazs have developed a AAV-
gene delivery platform that rescues sIL6R levels and its IL-6 capture activity in vivo. They will use this system
to experimentally define how disease-causing polymorphisms within sIL6R dysregulate IL-6 capture and
inflammatory activity in vivo, and then in parallel, the therapeutic sIL6R expression level needed to correct IL-6
homeostasis and restore function therein. Collectively, this proposal will define and exploit newly discovered
biology of sIL6R immune-defense to treat human disease, consistent with the goals and mission of the NIH."
10746808,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite years of research, few modifiable risk factors for breast cancer have been identified and the incidence
of breast cancer remains high with over 260,000 new cases estimated to arise this year. Established risk
factors, such as a woman's reproductive history, body size, smoking, and alcohol intake, are estimated to
explain only about half of breast cancer cases. In addition, the underlying biological mechanisms linking
environmental risk factors and breast cancer are complex and are not well understood. As a result, new
approaches are required that can help identify environmental causes of breast cancer.
In this proposal, we apply a novel biomarker approach using protein adduct profiles (i.e., adductomics) to
investigate associations between environmental exposures and breast cancer risk in the Sister Study. Because
the Sister Study is a nationwide prospective cohort that was specifically designed to investigate environmental
risk factors for breast cancer, it is an ideal cohort to investigate the hypotheses outlined in this proposal. We
will focus specifically on Cys34 adducts of human serum albumin (HSA-Cys34), which is a nuecleophilic
“hotspot” on HSA that scavenges reactive electrophiles from circulating blood arising from both exogenous and
endogenous sources. We will first use an untargeted adductomics approach in our discovery experiments
using high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify new adduct features. We will then employ a
complementary targeted adductomics approach with enhanced analytical sensitivity and higher sample
throughput to measure adduct profiles in stored plasma samples collected at baseline from 1,800 incident
breast cancer cases and a random sample of 1,800 Sister Study participants. Adducts will be compared across
groups to identify discordant adducts, and we will use time-to-diagnosis in our regression models to help
differentiate between causal and responsive breast cancer biomarkers. Analyses will also be performed to
investigate associations specificto breast cancer subtypes defined by ER/PR and HER2 status.Finally, we will
perform secondary analyses and investigate associations between HSA-Cys34 adducts and environmental
exposures using existing air pollution exposure data. To achieve our study goals, we will integrate
methodological and conceptual tools from the fields of exposure science, cancer epidemiology, and cancer
biology to forge a transdisciplinary approach for investigating environmental risk factors for breast cancer. This
project has the potential for high impact by potentially identifying modifiable risk factors for breast cancer, and
identifying underlying biological pathways linking the environment and breast cancer etiology."
10734047,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Serious mental illness (SMI) that includes schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are common, complex
and debilitating psychiatric disorders that together affect over 2% of the population and carry considerable
morbidity, mortality, and personal and societal cost. Over the last decade, large-scale genome wide association
studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of loci contributing to the risk of SCZ and BD. Advancing these
statistical associations to causal mechanisms for SMIs is very challenging due to incomplete understanding of
the non-coding regulatory mechanisms in the human brain tissue and the local correlation of risk variants.
Therefore, a systematic analysis that performs fine-mapping to jointly identify and validate a credible set of causal
variants in SMI and molecular features that includes transcripts and regulatory sequences, in relevant tissues
and cell types is a critical next step. The overarching goal of our proposal is to leverage genomics and multiscale
functional omics (gene expression and epigenome regulation) data and perform fine mapping to detect and
validate causal variants, transcripts and regulatory sequences in SMI. In Aim 1, we will perform large-scale trans-
ancestry GWAS of SCZ and BD to expand the current repertoire of risk (and resilience) loci and refine the
credible sets of causal variants underlying genome-wide significant associations. In Aim 2, we will integrate
putative causal variants with multiscale functional omics data from human brain tissue that capture gene
expression and epigenome regulation at the bulk, cell type-specific and single cell level to identify credible sets
of transcripts and regulatory sequences. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate putative causal variants and
regulatory sequences, by using novel approaches that combine massively parallel reporter assays and genome
editing in excitatory and inhibitory neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Our computational
and experimental aims bridge the gap between the fine-mapping of causal variants, the molecular gene-
regulatory effects of risk variants on enhancer activity and gene expression and their biological effects at the
cellular level. If successful, our project can elucidate the genes, pathways, and mechanisms underlying SCZ and
BD, and provide new insights and avenues for therapeutic development."
10753539,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pertussis is a respiratory disease caused by the obligate human pathogen Bordetella pertussis. Two generations
of pertussis vaccines have been developed and licensed: whole cell pertussis (DTP) and acellular pertussis
(DTaP/Tdap). Pertussis was thought to be a disease of the past but has recently re-emerged. The number of
cases of pertussis in 2012 was 48-fold over the lowest year on record (1976), which was also a 50-year high.
While the increase of pertussis has multiple potential reasons, epidemiological studies clearly suggest that the
duration of immunity of both DTaP and Tdap wanes quickly each year after a booster, and regresses to non-
protective levels in humans. Each dose of whole cell vaccine contains hundreds of antigens, of which numerous
are immunodominant. Whole cell vaccines also induce T helper 1 and 17 (Th1/Th17) cellular immune responses.
On the other hand, acellular vaccines focus Th2-mediated humoral responses exclusively to pertussis toxin,
filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin, and fimbriae. We aim to develop a vaccine that would induce Th1
responses and include a greater number of antigens than acellular vaccines. mRNA vaccines provide a platform
that can be easily modified for the targeted antigen/pathogen and they induce Th1 responses. mRNA vaccines
encode the antigen, which once expressed, results in immunity mediated by Tfh responses. We used an mRNA
platform to screen antigens of B. pertussis and identified a protective multivalent formulation (mRNA-DTP10; 8
pertussis antigens with diphtheria and tetanus antigens) in a murine challenge model. In this project, we will
further extend our studies and investigate the correlates of protection of the mRNA-pertussis vaccine in the
murine model with longevity studies and examine DTaP prime / mRNA-boost effects (SA1). Next, we will utilize
the coughing rat model of pertussis with whole body plethysmography to compare mRNA, whole cell, and
acellular immunity for protection against cough (SA2). We will study the mRNA pertussis vaccine in
immunogenicity and challenge experiments using the baboon model of pertussis (SA3). Lastly, we will aim to
develop a suite of assays to phenotype antibodies produced by mRNA pertussis vaccines and bridge each of
the pertussis models, which will facilitate clinical development. Through these studies, we aim to characterize
the mRNA-pertussis immunity and develop a clearer understanding of how this vaccine platform can be used to
overcome “complex or difficult” pathogens that employ numerous virulence factors. We expect the data acquired
in each aim will result in a deeper understanding of pertussis immunity as well as illuminate the mRNA platform
for bacterial vaccines."

 Obesity is a major public health problem that is related to a variety of illnesses, such as heart disease
and diabetes. Prior research indicates that social stressors contribute to risk for obesity, possibly through
alterations in diet and physical activity. However, it is not fully clear how these alterations contribute to obesity.
In this study, we examine how the stressors of social isolation and discrimination are related to eating
behaviors and dietary patterns, and further, how these behaviors affect the brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) axis.
Our prior research has suggested that BGM alterations play an important role in the development of obesity.
Our study focuses on Mexican and Filipina women because research shows that they encounter a high burden
of obesity as well as exposure to social stressors.
 We will screen and enroll approximately 300 Mexican and Filipina women who will then provide
information about social stressors via a survey, dietician-administered 24-hour food recall, measured
anthropometrics (e.g. waist circumference), questionnaire data regarding diet and eating behaviors, and
accelerometer data on physical activity. Stool and serum to determine microbial-related measures (16sRNA
sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and metabolomics), and MRI to assess brain alterations in the extended
reward network will be collected. Advanced multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate data from
multiple data sources (neuroimaging, microbiome and metabolite profiles, survey data, diet, and
clinical/behavioral data). This analysis will determine the unique variance associated with ethnicity and social
stressors in moderating eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and the BGM axis related to obesity. An
integrated systems investigative approach such as the one proposed is a critical step to understanding the
mechanisms contributing to obesity. Further the impact of how environmental stressors “get under the skin”
and impact eating behaviors and diet patterns and the BGM axis is important in addressing health disparities in
ethnic groups and in women. This premise guides the specific aims of this proposal: Aim A: We will phenotype
the influence of stressors on brain signatures and eating patterns in obesity. Aim B: We will phenotype the
influence of stressors on gut microbiome and metabolites in obesity. Aim C: We will apply advanced analytical
techniques in order to determine ethnic differences in the influence of stressors on the BGM axis in obesity.
 The results of this study will provide novel information about a possible pathway whereby social
stressors affect behavioral, neurological and microbiome mechanisms related to obesity risk. It will also provide
new information in BGM patterns in two understudied ethnic groups. In the long term, this research may
suggest possible approaches for intervention that may help reduce inequalities in obesity and related health
problems."

3. Project Summary/Abstract
 We have recently completed analyses which identifies a population of patients that have a markedly
increased risk of developing dementia/progressive cognitive impairment. Intracerebral hemorrhage patients had
been reported to have a 42% risk of progressive cognitive impairment roughly 3 and a half years after their stroke
and we have found a 39% risk in an independent population of patients. This extraordinarily high rate among
survivors of ICH without a prior history of dementia yields multiple different hypotheses. First, it may be that the
causes of ICH itself are also risk factors for dementia. If so, then those that develop dementia should demonstrate
worsening markers of these causes such as cerebral small vessel disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
However, another prominent hypothesis in the field is that the hemorrhage itself is markedly inflammatory. If this
inflammatory response were to trigger a progressive cognitive decline, then these cases should demonstrate
differential inflammatory gene expression changes.
 The Recovery of StrokE (NS100417) study has recruited 163 cases out of a planned 500 total cases of ICH
including 3T MRI, baseline and 3 month samples for DNA, RNA-sequencing and detailed baseline, 3 and 6
month motor, cognitive, behavioral and functional examinations. The current proposal seeks to re-enroll 250
cases of the planned 500 for 12 to 24 month follow-up neuroimaging, RNA sampling and repeated examination
measures to address the following aims: 1) Determine if progressive cognitive impairment correlates with an
increase in markers of cerebral small vessel disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy; 2) Determine if
inflammation as measured by RNA-sequencing markers of inflammation correlates with progressive cognitive
impairment and 3) identify novel neuroimaging markers associated with progressive cognitive decline.
 If successful, we will provide the largest longitudinal multiple assessment evaluation of ICH and answer the
major hypotheses on the development of dementia among survivors of ICH.

In this R01 proposal, we plan to use an integrative genomics (Omics) analysis to test two central hypotheses:
1) an environmental or cellular stimulus such as hormones induced distinct chromatin interacting foci such as
enhancer-enhancer looping foci play key roles in regulating cell transformed phenotype; and 2) 3D chromatin
structures play key roles in governing cell identities. The ultimate goal is to dissect the relationship between
chromatin interactions and cell identities or cellular phenotypes. Using a model system of ERα in breast
cancer, we will a) identify distinct types of ERα-regulated chromatin interacting foci including promoter-
enhancer, enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-repressor looping foci; and b) identify 3D-regulated breast cancer
cell identities and sensitive-resistant transition cell subpopulations. The successful completion of our proposed
studies will be of value to the genomics community and biologists in general, which may result in the better
understanding of the contribution of enhancer-enhancer interacting network towards functions of various
biological processes, in particular breast cancer endocrine resistance, and on how 3D chromatin structure
governs the breast cancer sensitive cell subpopulations into resistant cell subpopulations."

Anti-atherogenic functions of HDL are likely due to its mediation of reverse cholesterol transport
and to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Mounting evidence supports the concept
that HDL may become dysfunctional and that this contributes to the development of
atherosclerosis. The goal of our research is to define the mechanisms for HDL dysfunction in
diseases associated with significantly increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,
including familial hypercholesterolemia, chronic kidney disease and rheumatoid arthritis. A major
hypothesis of our proposal is that excessive inflammatory and oxidative burden impair HDL
atheroprotective functions, including cholesterol efflux capacity and anti-inflammatory and anti-
oxidative effects. Core B will be an integral part of the PPG by providing both analytical services
for analysis and isolation of lipoproteins and in vitro assays of HDL function in macrophages. The
goal of Specific Aim 1 is to provide isolation and analysis of lipoproteins, HDL subfractions, and
apoproteins. The Lipoprotein and HDL Function Core (Core B) will assist investigators by isolating
lipoproteins and apoproteins, including apoAI and apoAII, for functional studies and analyses of
protein modifications. The goal of Specific Aim 2 is to provide assays for HDL functions, including
the promotion of cholesterol efflux and efferocytosis in macrophages and the control of
inflammation and oxidation. Core B provides a number of services to investigators that require
unique instrumentation and methodologies and demand rigorous standardization procedures. It
would be costly, inefficient, and cumbersome to establish these procedures in individual
investigator laboratories. The consolidation of these services into the Core B laboratory provides
investigators with efficient, high quality, low-cost analyses. Another objective of Core B is to
provide education and training to investigators, fellows, and research technicians on the science
and methods of lipoprotein preparation and studies of HDL function."
10760228,"Project Summary/Abstract
Establishing how features of the visual world are represented in the activity of cortical circuits, and how these
representations are constructed during development remain fundamental challenges for visual neuroscience and
are central to understanding the neural basis of visual perception. A critical function of circuits in primary visual
cortex is the integration of the inputs from the two eyes to create a single binocularly aligned columnar
representation of stimulus features such as the orientation of edges and their direction of motion. This alignment
is evident at the scale of columns, and at the scale of individual neurons: visual stimuli presented to either eye
yield highly similar responses at both scales, giving rise to our coherent binocular perception of the world. Our
studies during the previous period of support have revealed a surprising new and critical role for visual
experience in the development of binocularly aligned columnar representations in ferret visual cortex. Prior to
natural eye opening, visual stimulation thru either eye evokes highly structured columnar maps of orientation
preference, but there are conspicuous mismatches in the spatial organization of these maps that reflect
misalignment in the orientation preference of the inputs that individual neurons receive from the two eyes. Shared
binocular experience immediately following eye opening is necessary to drive changes in the orientation
preference of individual neurons that achieve a single binocularly unified representation. The goal of this proposal
is to employ new technologies that we have developed that make it possible to visualize the functional
organization of excitatory synaptic inputs to individual neurons in order to probe the mechanisms responsible for
this alignment process. We start in Aim 1 by examining the synaptic basis for binocular integration in the mature
visual cortex, combining 2-photon in vivo imaging of calcium signals with post-hoc electron microscopy to
elucidate how the numbers, strength, and the spatial arrangement of functionally characterized synapses
contribute to the binocular response properties of individual layer 2/3 neurons. In Aim 2, we examine the
functional synaptic architecture of binocular integration early in development and use chronic imaging techniques
to probe changes induced by the onset of visual experience. In Aim 3 we combine in vivo imaging with expansion
microscopy to explore how 2 major sources of inputs to layer 2/3—feedforward inputs from layer 4, and horizontal
connections from other layer 2/3 neurons--contribute to the mature pattern of binocular integration and to the
development of binocularly aligned representations. Taken together, we believe these experiments will yield a
wealth of new insights into the synaptic basis for binocular integration and the experience-dependent
mechanisms that achieve aligned representations in visual cortex."

Proper temperature and oxygen levels enable essential life activities. Low temperature (hypothermia) and
reduced level of oxygen (hypoxia) pervasively influence fundamental biochemical processes, cellular
metabolism, organismic physiology and behaviors. Hypoxia and oxidative stresses are also key features in
ischemic disorders, including stroke and heart attack, treatment of which can greatly benefit from the emerging
procedure of “therapeutic hypothermia.” Our laboratory is interested in fundamental genetic analysis and
mechanistic studies of hypoxia, hypothermia, innate ischemic tolerance in resilient organisms, and
cytoprotection against tissue injuries caused by metabolic stresses. We use 1) genetically tractable C. elegans
mutants isolated from large-scale screens with abnormal cell physiological and organismic behavioral
phenotypes in hypoxia/hypothermia responses and 2) Mangrove Killifish, the only known self-fertilizing
vertebrate with genetics similar to that of C. elegans and known extreme physiological phenotypes related to
hypoxia and hypothermia, as discovery tools. In addition, we culture mammalian neural stem cells ex vivo
isolated from hibernating ground squirrels to unravel cellular intrinsic mechanisms of hypoxia/hypothermia
tolerance. With multidisciplinary approaches and technologies, we have been running a productive research
program and already discovered novel mechanisms of action of genes, protein variants and pathways in
conferring cytoprotection and organismic responses to hypoxia and hypothermia. In this R35 application, we
propose to continue these tractable and innovative lines of inquiries to expand our basic understanding of how
cells and organisms cope with hypoxia and hypothermia, to characterize novel genes and pathways already
identified from our forward genetic and RNAi screens, and to identify key genetic determinants of innate
hypoxia/ischemic tolerance in resilient organisms. The PI and laboratory's extensive prior experience and
expertise in diverse but complementary model systems are well suited for executing and successfully
completing the project in the Cardiovascular Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco
(UCSF). As the MIRA R35 is intended to “enable consolidation of NIGMS support for multiple projects that may
be disparate” as is our case, we will balance efforts and resources dedicated to each of the model systems,
which are similarly tractable towards addressing the same core questions in our research program."
10782449,"Gliomas are the most common malignant human brain tumors. Even when treated with surgery,
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, patients with the most commonly diagnosed glioma, grade IV glioblastoma
(GB), have a life expectancy of only 14 months. The primary challenge to treating GB is its highly invasive nature,
as infiltrating cancer cells are “protected” from exposure to systemically administered chemotherapies by the
blood brain barrier (BBB). Here, we propose the development of a therapeutic approach for GB that couples
non-invasive BBB opening via the activation of intravascular microbubbles (MBs) with MRI-guided focused
ultrasound (FUS) and biodegradable [polyaspartic acid-polyethyleneglycol (PAA-PEG)], cisplatin (CDDP)-
loaded, “brain-penetrating nanoparticles”. We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of “first-generation”
CDDP-BPN agents, the ability of FUS to precisely target the delivery of BPN across the BBB to MR image-
selected targets in the brain, and the delivery of CDDP-BPN to gliomas.
 Here, we propose four specific aims designed to markedly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the
approach and advance it to clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will engineer a “next-generation” CDDP-BPN for
formulation specifically for systemic administration and FUS-targeted delivery. In parallel, Aims 2 and 3 will be
to markedly augment BPN delivery to invasive gliomas via novel, clinically-operable, modifications to FUS
application protocols. These will include extending treatment volumes based on MRI guidance, testing the
concept of “site-selective” acoustic emissions feedback during BBB opening, and evaluating newly identified
FUS “pre-conditioning” pulse sequences for their ability to increase BPN penetration. Of note, an innovative new
MR image-guided transport analysis of tumor interstitial flow and diffusion will be employed in Aims 2 and 3 to
directly ascertain how FUS modulates the tumor microenvironment to facilitate CDDP-BPN spread though the
treatment volume. Aim 4 will then start by establishing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CDDP-BPN and
assessing cisplatin levels in gliomas after CDDP-BPN delivery using optimized FUS protocols. Next, we will test
whether combining next-generation CDDP-BPN with novel FUS protocols for augmented BPN delivery will
control tumor growth, block infiltration, and improve survival. Importantly, we are about to open a clinical trial at
UVA wherein MR image-guided FUS (Insightec Exablate Neuro System) will be used with MBs to open the BBB
and deliver chemotherapy on a weekly basis to GB patients after they have undergone surgical resection and
radiation. Moreover, MPI Hanes has deep experience with advancing controlled-release formulations for drug
delivery to clinical trials. Thus, a clear precedent has been set for translation. Given our infrastructure and
expertise, we are exceptionally well-positioned to translate successful findings to the clinic."
10755263,"There is increasing recognition of mitochondria as signaling organelles. An important facet of this “adjunct”
mitochondrial function is epigenetic modulation, as exemplified by the generation of acetyl-CoA and S-
adenosylmethionine used in the acetylation and methylation, respectively, of DNA and histones. In addition,
alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG) and 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), metabolites generated almost exclusively in the
mitochondria, are found to modulate the activity of αKG-dependent dioxygenases, including TET DNA
hydroxylases and histone demethylase (HDM), thus controlling DNA and histone methylation. Notably, our
group discovered that αKG activates and 2-HG inhibits FTO and ALKBH5, RNA demethylases that act on N6-
methyladenosine (m6A), a reversible chemical modification of mRNA (the epitranscriptome) that influences
gene expression. Similar to other epigenetic marks, RNA methylation is dynamically controlled and m6A
abundance influence various biological functions, while its misregulation associates with human diseases.
Considering that αKG/2-HG are generated mainly by intermediary mitochondrial metabolism, and that the
activity of RNA demethylases are modulated by these metabolites, it is reasonable to speculate that
mitochondria play an important role in the control of RNA methylation homeostasis. In particular, we postulate
that the mitochondrial enzymes D-2- and L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HGDH and L2HGDH),
which catalyze the interconversion of 2-HG to αKG, are integral to the interplay between mitochondrial
metabolism and the control of RNA methylation. This hypothesis is supported by our earlier discovery that loss
of function D2HGDH mutations leads to decreased activity of the αKG-dependent TET and HDM enzymes. We
recently expanded on this concept by identifying upstream signals that regulate D2HGDH and L2HGDH
expression/activity. Using ChIP assays, inducible cell lines and a transgenic mouse model we discovered that
MYC transcriptionally activates D2HGDH and L2HGDH, and that in a D2/L2HGDH/αKG-dependent manner it
induces FTO and ALKBH5 function leading to RNA demethylation in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, we found
that the MYC-D2/L2HGDH-αKG axis also promotes the nuclear accumulation of FTO and ALKBH5, in
association with enhanced O-GlcNAcylation, a post-translational modification executed by another
mitochondrial enzyme, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Here, using multiple genetic models in vitro and in vivo,
we will test the hypothesis that a novel mitochondrial signaling axis, which includes MYC at the proximal point,
D2/L2HGDH and OGT at the center, and, distally, FTO/ALKBH5 activity, controls the cellular epitranscriptome.
Our specific aims are: 1) characterize the contribution of D2HGDH/L2HGDH and of intermediate metabolites to
the control of m6A levels, 2) determine the mechanistic basis for the increased O-GlcNAcylation mediated by
the MYC-D2/L2HGDH-αKG axis and its role in promoting RNA demethylation, 3) define a mitochondrial
metabolism-dependent methylRNA/gene expression signature in human cells."
10703222,"Summary
Experience with the external world is essential for fine-tuning immature sensory circuits during critical periods in
development. In visual systems, experience regulates the alignment of visual information from the ipsilateral and
contralateral eye onto neurons in the binocular primary visual cortex (bV1). At the onset of the critical period for
binocular vision, bV1 neurons respond to distinct orientation preferences to each eye. With visual experience,
synaptic inputs from each eye get modified, and bV1 neurons develop matching orientation preferences.
Disrupting visual experience during this critical period, however, can elicit severe impairments in binocular vision,
causing amblyopia. It remains unclear how synaptic inputs are modified to regulate the development of
orientation matching in bV1 neurons. Hebbian and heterosynaptic plasticity are mechanisms of experience-
dependent plasticity that modify synaptic inputs based on the correlation of pre- and postsynaptic neuronal
responses and on the activity of neighboring synapses, respectively. Together, these two mechanisms can
shape the selectivity of neuronal responses by strengthening synapses that are correlated with the postsynaptic
neuron or with synaptic neighbors, and by weakening those that are uncorrelated. I hypothesize that Hebbian
and heterosynaptic mechanisms regulate the alignment and plasticity of eye-specific inputs onto bV1
neurons over the critical period. To test this hypothesis, I will chronically image the visual responses of the
neuronal soma and of dendritic spines using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to track eye-specific inputs on
L2/3 bV1 neurons. I will then map the synaptic composition of the physiologically identified dendritic spines post
hoc by implementing a novel tissue expansion technology called Magnified Analysis of the Proteome (MAP) that
allows for super-resolution imaging of intact tissue. I will combine these cutting-edge technologies in my two
aims to delineate how the alignment of somatic orientation preference arises through synaptic remodeling of
eye-specific inputs. In Aim 1, I will characterize the functional, structural, and molecular properties of eye-specific
inputs across development to determine whether Hebbian and heterosynaptic plasticity is taking place during
somatic orientation matching. In Aim 2, I will deprive the contralateral eye of visual experience using monocular
deprivation (MD) to determine how disruptions in binocular vision impact eye-specific inputs on bV1 neurons.
Together, these experiments will answer fundamental questions on the nature of experience-dependent plasticity
in the binocular visual cortex. Furthermore, these studies will provide critical insight into the synaptic basis of
amblyopia, as well as neurodevelopmental disorders that are induced by synaptic dysfunction."

 Metabolic dysregulation is the major preventable risk factor for leading causes of chronic
disease-related deaths. More specifically, chronic obesity is correlated with adipocyte hypertrophy
and hyperplasia, both of which may be circadianly regulated. All circadian clocks are cell-intrinsic,
and circadian oscillators that are tissue-specific control metabolic homeostasis by fine-tuning
nutrient utilization; adipose tissue responds to microenvironmental changes in a clock-dependent
manner. Thermogenic adipocytes can redirect energy away from ATP production during nutrient
excess by disrupting the electrochemical proton gradient, producing heat in a process called Non-
Shivering Thermogenesis (NST). Thermogenic adipocytes are sometimes capable of cell-
autonomously sensing ambient temperature and adopting a reversible thermogenic profile. The
circadian clock's importance in this thermogenic plasticity is not well understood, nor the cellular
decision to adopt this state. The objective of this work is to understand how circadian rhythms
affect adipocyte biology, especially thermogenic plasticity. To delineate the relationship between
the cellular circadian system and adipocyte biology in the absence of organismal cues, circadian
output will be characterized in Specific Aim 1 by transcriptionally profiling in vitro differentiated
adipocytes from inguinal adipose tissue over 3 circadian days with a 2-hour resolution via
RNAseq. In this way I will determine what aspects of adipocyte biology and environmental stimuli
can be influenced by time-of-day. Though multilocularity and mitochondrial abundance are not
indicators of thermogenic potential per se, these two organelles are intricately involved in NST.
To extend the hypothesis that thermogenic plasticity is clock-controlled, I will use quantitative
fluorescence live cell microscopy to characterize lipid droplet and mitochondrial spatial patterning
and thereby describe organelle morphology as a function of circadian time. In Specific Aim 2 I
will determine the cell-autonomous clock’s role in heat production, the quintessential component
of thermogenesis, using infrared thermal imaging to identify rhythms in heat production (1) during
a state of decreased bioenergetic efficiency via uncoupling with BAM15 and (2) by suppressing
UCP1 with purine nucleotides. The long-term goal of this proposal is to determine the clock’s role
in regulating thermogenesis. Findings from this study will increase our understanding of clock-
controlled energy metabolism and adipocyte dysfunction, advancing our understanding of the
non-linear association between weight, energy expenditure and risk in chronic disease."

Cancer treatments have evolved extensively over the past few decades, leading to vast improvements in
overall survival and cure rates. However, the collateral damage inflicted upon healthy tissues by both targeted
and cytotoxic agents frequently causes life-threatening irreversible toxicities. Some of the most common
toxicities include therapy-induced vascular impairments such as atherosclerosis, heart failure, ischemia, acute
thrombosis, and venous thromboembolism. Despite their widespread use, it is poorly understood how
chemotherapies and ionizing radiation cause vascular toxicities. Most cancer therapies typically induce
apoptosis (programmed cell death) by damaging common cellular components such as DNA or by blocking
critical signaling pathways. Since vascular cells are also exposed to these agents at high concentrations, they
could be vulnerable to therapy-induced apoptosis. However, the vasculature is comprised of several cell types
including vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells; it is unknown which cells are sensitive to anti-cancer
agents and how they may contribute to long-term vascular dysfunction in patients. Using human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) for in vitro disease modeling, we will investigate vascular toxicities in hiPSC-
derived vascular endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. Utilizing robust differentiation protocols
already established in our laboratory, we will rigorously test how the survival and function of these cells are
affected by cancer treatments. We will also characterize the regulation of apoptosis in both vascular cell types
by measuring apoptotic priming and expression of BCL-2 family proteins. Additionally, we will look at the
functional and morphological changes that these cells undergo in response to cancer treatments that may
contribute to vascular toxicities. We hypothesize that each vascular cell type possesses differential levels of
apoptotic priming, and unique vulnerabilities to our panel of FDA-approved cancer therapies that drive therapy-
induced vascular toxicities. Our studies will elucidate potential mechanisms and determine contributions of
each cell type to vascular toxicities observed in cancer patients. Further, since aging is known to play a role in
both vascular toxicity and regulation of apoptosis, we will investigate how age affects apoptotic priming and
therapy sensitivity of vascular cells. We will replicate key experiments in mice at various life stages (neonate,
juvenile, adult and advanced age) to validate our in vitro findings and elucidate how age affects the
development of vascular toxicities. We will also utilize endothelial cell-specific BAX/BAK double knockout mice
to determine the extent to which apoptosis blockade can ameliorate vascular toxicity induced by cancer
treatment. Altogether, our work will test how apoptosis regulation affects the sensitivity of vascular cells to
chemotherapy and radiation and how this is altered by aging. These results will lay the groundwork for
improved therapy regimens in the clinic that may decrease long-term vascular toxicities in cancer patients."
10750973,"The CLC (“Chloride Channel”) family encompasses two major ion-transport mechanisms: half
of CLC homologs are electrodiffusive ion channels, and half are secondary active transporters
that stoichiometrically exchange Cl– for H+. The occurrence of two mechanisms in one family
suggests they operate by variations on a common theme. Indeed, experimental results support
the hypothesis that CLC channels are “broken” transporters, in which tight coordination between
inner and outer gates is lost. Thus, subtle differences in protein conformational dynamics and ion
binding—and the interactions between them—can produce two different types of ion transport
behavior in proteins with the same secondary structure. Understanding the molecular basis of
these differences will inform our understanding of both CLC channels and transporters.
 As secondary active transporters, CLC transporters harness energy stored in one ion's
electrochemical gradient (Cl– or H+) to pump the other ion against its gradient. This occurs through
tight coupling of protein conformational changes to ion binding and transport events. To develop
a fully integrated structural description of ion coupling in the CLC transport mechanism, this
project will combine complementary cutting-edge approaches, including cryo-electron microscopy
to determine high-resolution structures, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy to
monitor the conformational state of the transporter under different conditions and with different
mutations, MD simulations to determine hydration pathways under various conditions, and
quantitative functional assays to connect structural dynamics to function."

Given that deaths linked to opioid addiction are at an all-time high in the United States, there is
a crucial need to understand brain mechanisms impeding versus promoting recovery, a process
marked by prolonged abstinence and use of internal/external resources to resolve drug
problems. The broad aims of this proposal are to understand how brain circuitry implicated in
the salience of aversive internal (bodily signals) and external (stressful, loss) stimuli tracks
recovery within and across individuals with opioid addiction to (1) inform future targets for
intervention (e.g., brain neurofeedback); and (2) aid the development of individualized treatment
to reduce drug-related deaths. Within three months of treatment, 50% of substance users
relapse, taking drugs to avoid aversive bodily states linked to craving, withdrawal, and stress.
Our preliminary data suggest that opioid users show greater negative affect, higher intensity of
internal sensations, and faster pain reactivity than healthy controls, paired with lower salience-
relevant brain responses during attention to bodily signals and anticipation of monetary losses
However, it is unclear whether aversive salience-related brain circuitry improves and tracks
recovery during the vulnerable first three months during treatment. The specific aims of this
proposal test how salience-based brain circuitry differs between 200 treatment-seeking
individuals with opioid use disorder and 50 healthy individuals at four timepoints during early
opioid recovery (2 weeks and 1, 2, and 3 months), identifying what self-report, behavioral, and

maintain abstinence. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms involving bodily

Krabbe disease, known as globoid-cell leukodystrophy (GLD), is a classical neurological lysosomal storage
disease (LSD) caused by a genetic deficiency of b-galactocerebrosidase (GALC), lysosomal hydrolase
responsible for removing galactose residues of galactocebroside and galactosylsphingosine, mostly known as
psychosine. This sphingolipid is increased in brain of patients with GLD. Psychosine is physiologically present
in most brain cells at low concentrations, however, at high concentrations, it becomes extremely cytotoxic,
especially oligodendrocytes resulting in diffuse demyelination and subsequent devastating leukodystrophy.
Given the rapidly progressive nature of the neurological manifestations in GLD, small molecule therapies,
which are more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), become an attractable therapeutic approach.
Previously, from newborn brain cortices of GLD murine model, we established a specific brain-derived cell line
that recapitulates cellular phenotypic aspects of GLD, in particular the increased psychosine levels, not
observed in GLD primary cells. In 2 different small molecule screenings, we identified 2 classes of potential
therapeutic molecules for GLD. First, in the parent grant, we developed and implemented a live cell-based
throughput LC-MS/MS assay for psychosine and identified small molecules that reduce its levels to almost
normal physiological range. Second, expressing a common misfolded GALC-G270D in a brain-derived line, we
implemented another cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) screening and identified molecules able to
assist the folding and increased the mutant GALC activity. I propose to test the hypothesis that the psychosine-
reducing and GALC-folding assistant molecules are therapeutic agents that reduce psychosine levels resulting
in the arrest and even prevention of the rapid demyelination in GLD. Based on our previous studies in GLD and
our expertise assembled, our goals are to use induced-neural stem cells (iNSC) from patients with wide GLD
spectrum and examine and prioritize the small molecule ‘hits’ that efficaciously reduce psychosine levels; (ii)
perform SARs and generate different analogs to optimize their efficacy and improve their access to the central
nervous system (CNS); (iii) examine selected small molecules agents in the murine GLD models monitoring
established neurobehavioral outcomes and BBB penetration to prioritize the compounds for further studies.
Due to initial encouraging results of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), newborn screening (NBS)
for GLD has been implemented in several states. However, the HSCT is unable to prevent later onset
neurological symptoms 8. As GLD is currently screened in all newborns in several states, the validation of small
molecule candidates proposed in this project becomes highly important and urgent. Therefore, a burgeoning
number of asymptomatic newborns are now, and will be, diagnosed with GLD throughout these state NBS
programs. Most, if not all, of them will eventually benefit from the small molecule therapies coming from the
proposed project."

Manifold G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are expressed in the human heart. Upon activation, these cell-
surface receptors—which include angiotensin II, 𝛽 adrenergic, 𝛼 adrenergic and endothelin-1 receptors—initiate
signaling pathways that underlie both adaptive and maladaptive cardiovascular physiology. A significant subset
of these cardiac GPCRs couple to heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gq family, which are composed of 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝛾
subunits. Previous studies have firmly linked G𝛼q-dependent signaling to cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyocyte
apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which active G𝛼q signaling promotes these pathologies are
not fully understood. The codified G𝛼q signaling pathway involves the stimulation of phospholipase C beta
(PLC𝛽) isoforms by G𝛼q-GTP. PLC𝛽 then catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into
inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, thereby leading to intracellular Ca2+ signaling and protein kinase
C activation. G𝛼q-GTP activation of PLC𝛽 is involved in cardiac hypertrophy, but active G𝛼q subunits may also
signal in a PLC𝛽-independent manner through alternative effectors, including p63RhoGEF and Trio. Moreover,
our laboratory recently discovered a novel array of potential G𝛼q effectors in a proximity labeling proteomic
screen. This screen involved in-cell proximity-based biotinylation of target proteins, which was catalyzed by bait
proteins (wild-type G𝛼q or constitutively active G𝛼q Q209L) fused to TurboID, a promiscuous biotin ligase.
Biotinylated target proteins were captured via streptavidin pulldown and identified with proteomic mass
spectrometry. This approach enabled the high-confidence identification of numerous proteins that were
selectively enriched in cells containing G𝛼q-Q209L-TurboID compared to cells containing G𝛼q-WT-TurboID.
These proteins included known G𝛼q interactors (PLC𝛽, Trio, and GRK2); however, scattered among these known
interactors were several proteins that have not been previously shown to interact with active G𝛼q. These exciting
results, combined with the scientific community's scattered understanding of G𝛼q-mediated cardiomyocyte
pathophysiology, lead to the central hypothesis of my proposed work. I hypothesize that G𝛼q possesses as-
yet-uncharacterized effectors that participate in G𝛼q-mediated cardiac cell physiology and disease. I will
test this hypothesis with a two-part approach. In Aim 1, I will employ cell-based assays and in vitro biophysical
experiments to ascertain whether a select number of preliminary hits (5-10 total) from our proximity labeling
proteomic screen directly interact with active G𝛼q. In Aim 2, I will measure hypertrophy and apoptosis in
cardiomyocytes subjected to siRNA knockdown of putative G𝛼q effectors, especially SMARCD3, a regulatory
component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex that has shown promise in my initial studies.
Cumulatively, my proposed research will define G𝛼q-dependent signaling pathways that contribute to
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and, thus, will guide therapeutic strategies for combatting cardiovascular disease."

Over 60 million persons in the U.S. identify themselves as Latinx and 25.6% are children under the age of 16.
Surgical disparities for adults and children have been identified as a major problem in the US and can be
experienced at multiple points along a patient's health care trajectory. Data from our center indicates that a
substantial portion of Latinx children who undergo surgery experience high anxiety and postoperative pain as
well as postoperative impairments in psychological and physical functioning as compared to White non-Latin
children who undergo surgery. Recent growth in use of mobile devices provides us an opportunity to create low-
cost mHealth behavioral interventions to reduce this disparity in surgical outcomes.
In a previous NIH award, the PI developed and tested an evidence based mHealth tailored intervention
(WebTIPS) that aims to prepare and be a companion of a child and their family during a surgical event. WebTIPS
aims to enhance the recovery of the child in several ways such as reducing anxiety and pain and is based on
information provision, modeling, and teaching of coping skills. WebTIPS, however, was developed and validated
with a population of primarily White non-Latinx English-speaking children and their parents. Unfortunately, it is
well established that mHealth interventions are significantly less effective when used with specific ethnic
minorities unless they underwent a process of cultural adaptation. Over the past 4-years, we have established
multiple academic and community collaborations, conducted extensive participatory research with Latinx
stakeholders and used the heuristic framework and a modified ecological validity model to culturally adapt
WebTIPS. The culturally adapted intervention is called L-WebTIPS.
The overall aim of this application is to reduce surgical disparities in a population of Latinx children undergoing
surgery. The first phase of this application (R61) includes web programming of L-WebTIPS, conduct formative
evaluation and conduct feasibly RCT to test this intervention. The second phase (R33) includes a multi-center
RCT which aims to determine the effectiveness of L-WebTIPS compared to attention control intervention in
decreasing postoperative pain, opioids consumption and lowering anxiety in Latinx children undergoing
outpatient surgery. Secondary aims of the R33 include examining the impact of L-WebTIPS on home-based
clinical recovery parameters such as pain, analgesic requirements, new onset behavioral changes and return to
normal daily activity in Latinx children undergoing outpatient surgery. We also plan to determine if the use of L-
WebTIPS reduces anxiety and improve experience among the parents of Latinx children undergoing surgery.
Finally we plan to determine if the use of L-WebTIPS reduces anxiety and enhance experience among the
parents of Latinx children undergoing surgery. We submit that using a cultural adaption process for an existing
validated intervention will accelerate the process of reducing surgical disparities and bringing an effective
intervention to clinical settings and routine use."

Nephrotic syndrome is a major manifestation of human glomerular disease, and patients with this condition
develop large amounts of protein in the urine (proteinuria) and elevated levels of plasma cholesterol
(hypercholesterolemia). Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is well studied in the liver where
it is implicated in the development of hypercholesterolemia but little is known about the link between kidney
PCSK9 and hypercholesterolemia. Statins and/or PCSK9 antibodies are now considered the standard care for
patients with hypercholesterolemia but this therapeutic approach only treats hypercholesterolemia once it is
established and does not prevent the development of hypercholesterolemia.
Recent studies from the applicant’s lab suggest that PCSK9 is expressed in the kidney, mainly in the cortical
collecting duct (CCD) and that PCSK9 secreted from the CCD initiates hypercholesterolemia in nephrotic
syndrome. In fact, PCSK9 expression is increased in the CCD in human focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis
(FSGS) kidney biopsies compared to controls. This phenomenon was also noted in two animal models of FSGS.
In this proposal, the PI will study molecular mechanisms of the origin of hypercholesterolemia of nephrotic
syndrome and will identify the specific glycomic profile of CCD-secreted PCSK9. It will allow its detection and
depletion during the early phase of hypercholesterolemia to prevent or reduce progression to the established
phase.
In Specific Aim 1, the applicant will study by confocal microscopy, the expression of CCD-PCSK9 in biopsies
from nephrotic patients with other kidney diseases and corresponding animal models.
In Specific Aim 2, the applicant will use mass spectrometry to identify the specific post-translational modification
profile of PCSK9 secreted from the kidney CCD. The affinity of LDL receptor for different forms of recombinant
PCSK9, that mimic liver or kidney secreted proteins, will also be assed.
In Specific Aim 3, the applicant will study the effect of modulating CCD-PCSK9 expression and its depletion from
plasma on sustained hypercholesterolemia in nephrotic syndrome."

 Our lab works in the general area of computational structural biology although it also includes an
experimental component. We carry out theoretical and computational research and develop software tools, with
our efforts being guided by a variety of applications of biomedical importance. In the past we have elucidated
the structural and energetic origins of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, developed methods
for protein structure prediction, and detected novel structural and functional relationships between proteins based
on their geometric similarity. We currently focus on two distinct areas: the exploitation of structural information
to predict protein function on a genome-wide scale and the molecular basis of cell-cell recognition. The former
topic is the subject of the current proposal which focuses on the prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs)
and protein interaction networks. Our overarching goal is to provide a structure-informed perspective in multiple
areas of systems biology, thus filling a major gap in this rapidly growing area of biomedical research.
 Our research plans are derived from our development of the PrePPI algorithm and corresponding
database of human PPIs. PrePPI provides proteome-wide structure-based predictions of PPIs, and discovers
relationships not obtainable from other methods. The P-HIPSTer algorithm, which is derived from PrePPI, offers
analogous information for virus-human PPIs for 1000 human-infecting viruses. The reliability of both resources
has been validated experimentally, and both have revealed novel biological insights. PrePPI, in common with
other PPI databases, is cell-context independent and, for example, does not distinguish among tissue and tumor
types. To address this challenge, we developed the OncoSig algorithm that uses machine learning methods to
combine PrePPI with regulatory interactions from patient genomic data. The generation of tumor-specific lists of
PPIs, called SigSets, can then be mapped onto a context-dependent PPI network, or SigMap. We have also
developed novel methodologies that link protein structure space with chemical compound space.
 The current proposal builds on these accomplishments with new methodological developments and new
applications to network biology. We plan to integrate PrePPI with PPI information derived from genetic
interactions derived from the correlation of gene profiles across many conditions (e.g. tumor types, cell lines or
drug treatments). This will provide an unprecedented structure- and context-dependent view of protein interaction
networks. Other plans include the extension of PrePPI to non-human genomes and the extension of P-HIPSTer
to bacterial pathogens. Our overall vision includes the development of an integrated set of software tools and
databases that will advance cutting edge biomedical applications. These tools will range in scope from protein-
protein interaction networks, structure-derived protein function annotation and to the linking of network biology
to chemical compound space which will suggest druggable targets within networks and provide leads for small
molecules that can target individual proteins."
10755703,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of mortality worldwide. Radiomic features have been shown to
provide prognostic values in predicting lung cancer outcomes. Quantitative imaging features, often in
dauntingly large numbers, are extracted from tumor regions. However, not all these extracted features are
useful for tumor characterization, and feature selection is key for best performance. We plan to develop
feasible statistical methods to select relevant features and conduct feature learning, i.e. discovery of
representations needed for feature detection from the raw data.
On the molecular level, expression and genetic variation of some known genes, such as KDM4 genes, have
been linked to lung cancer prognosis, though little is known about epigenetic modifications' roles. Even fewer
studies have investigated the impact of the interplay of DNA methylation and coexisting chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD; a major clinical risk factor) on lung cancer risks. Statistically, drawing inference
when the predictors (the clinical indicators and the methylation sites) outnumber the sample size in regression
settings, e.g. generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and censored quantile regression
models, is very challenging. We plan to establish a new framework to draw inferences based on these
complicated models.
Growing evidence has suggested that cancer can be better understood through mutated or dysregulated
pathways or networks rather than individual DNA mutations and mechanism of lung cancer involves the
interplay of the cellular heterogeneity, the myriad of dysfunctional molecular and genetic networks. We plan to
develop new models to analyze those large scale network/pathway data and investigate how their dynamic
network structures can be predicted based on DNA mutations.
Leveraging the rich Boston Lung Cancer Survival Cohort database with 11,164 lung cancer cases, we expect
that our new statistical methods will help identify novel biomarkers linked to lung cancer. Our promising
preliminary results indicate the feasibility of the proposed work, which provides a solid radiomic and molecular
basis for prediction of lung cancer outcomes. Core methods will be distributed in open-source, freely available
software, naturally leading to implementable procedures for researchers and practitioners."

This grant will develop speckle contrast optical tomography (SCOT) for imaging of cerebral blood flow
dynamics in humans. Real-time maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF) at the bedside are a long sought-after
assay for neuro-critical care. Most critically, regional CBF measures can indicate which brain regions
may be becoming ischemic and are at danger for hypoxic-ischemic injury. Current clinical methods for
imaging CBF include positron emission tomography (PET) and arterial spin labeling with Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (ASL- MRI). Both modalities provide only snapshots of CBF, though, thus they miss
dynamic events, which are important in many clinical scenarios including acute stroke, traumatic brain
injury, and preterm birth. Non-invasive optical techniques are an attractive approach for imaging brain
blood dynamics at the bedside. The most widely used non-invasive optical neuroimaging technique uses
near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure fluctuations in hemoglobin concentrations. Over the last
decade high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) systems have made significant advances in
resolution and brain specificity making it an increasingly viable surrogate for functional MRI. However,
fNIRS and HD-DOT do not measure flow directly. Separately, there have been considerable advances in
laser speckle methods for measuring CBF. The most established deep tissue speckle method, diffuse
correlation spectroscopy (DCS), has been developed for in vivo tomographic imaging in rat models of
focal ischemia and for monitoring brain perfusion in humans.
However, in humans DCS has been limited to few spatial measurements, which precludes tomographic
imaging, and by instrumentation that permits only very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements.
This proposal will address these limitations and develop speckle contrast optical tomography (SCOT), a
new method for transcranial optical imaging of relative CBF in humans. SCOT allows for the use of lower
speed detectors that could readily be implemented in parallel in modern scientific CMOS cameras. Aim 1
will develop SCOT instrumentation with high-density imaging arrays. Aim 2 will develop anatomically
derived head models for reconstructing SCOT images. Aim 3 will validate SCOT-based measures in
patients with carotid artery occlusions based on comparison to PET and ASL-MRI. Aim 4 will evaluate
the longitudinal feasibility of using SCOT for imaging acute stroke. These studies will represent the
culmination of several advances in functional neuroimaging made possible by the research teams’
unique combination of clinical and technical expertise across the domains of neurology, functional
neuroimaging and biomedical optics."

The lung is a natural tolerogenic organ. Lung mucosal tolerance must be exquisitely controlled by the lung
immune system to avoid the development of chronic inflammatory lung diseases. Our knowledge of lung
tolerance is, however, inadequate. This is evident in asthma treatments. Current asthma therapies are limited to
blunting the progression of the disease. Patients relapse once the treatments are stopped because the
treatments do not repair the underlying, dysregulated lung mucosal tolerance. Lung dendritic cells (DCs)
orchestrate lung immune responses. We recently reported a lung epithelial cells IFNβ-TNFR2+ cDC2 (R2D2) -
Tregs axis in control of lung tolerance. We further showed that lung R2D2 cells are plastic, which makes them
an ideal target for therapeutic intervention. The essential role of lung Tregs in maintaining tolerance has been
firmly established. In this proposal, we focus on i) uncovering the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the lung
epithelial cells IFNβ-R2D2 control of lung mucosal tolerance; ii) developing an IFNβ-based regimen to restore
lung tolerance in chronic inflammatory lung diseases. We showed, in this proposal, that lung alveolar type II cells
(AT-II) are the IFNβ+ cells, and STING is essential for basal IFNβ production in the lung. In Aim1, we will
determine the in vivo mechanism by which lung AT-II cells sustain lung IFNβ level and maintain lung tolerance
at the steady-state. In Aim2, we will determine the tolerogenic IFNβ program in mouse and human lung R2D2
cells. In Aim3, we will develop an IFNβ-based regimen to enhance, restore lung tolerance, and prevent, treat
inflammatory lung diseases in mice. Chronic inflammatory lung diseases are the 4th leading cause of death in
the U.S. Understanding the fundamental mechanism for lung tolerance and develop a new innovative regimen
to restore lung mucosal tolerance in chronic lung diseases are highly significant."
10683226,"Rotator cuff tears affect millions of individuals each year in the United States, impacting
veterans and civilians alike. Tears dramatically alter joint mechanics leading to significant
damage to articular cartilage and adjacent (intact) tendons within the shoulder. This damage
leads to loss of function, pain, tear progression, and even tendon re-tear following repair.
Therefore, identifying mechanisms of joint damage after tendon tear is an active area of
research. We have previously discovered how joint damage occurs following supraspinatus and
infraspinatus tears using an in vivo rat rotator cuff tear model. These results altered clinical
practice by clearly demonstrating that loss of the anterior-posterior force couple leads to
permanent detrimental changes to the shoulder joint. While subscapularis tendon tears were
once thought to be uncommon, increased use of arthroscopy and improved imaging have led to
a dramatic increase in subscapularis tear diagnosis, specifically in ~ 50% of patients undergoing
rotator cuff repair. Furthermore, it has been suggested that unrecognized subscapularis tears
may be a source of chronic dysfunction and pain. However, no studies have examined the
critical question of how subscapularis tendon tears affect the shoulder joint, and as a result, a
clear best clinical approach has not been identified for this common and debilitating condition.
Therefore, the clinical objective of this work is to specifically determine the extent and
mechanisms of shoulder joint damage, functional alteration, and pain that result from rotator cuff
tears involving the subscapularis. We hypothesize that loss of the anterior-posterior force couple
after subscapularis tear leads to detrimental joint damage, loss of function, and pain, and that,
due to the critical role of the subscapularis, these effects are significantly increased when
compared to a supraspinatus tear alone. Additionally, we hypothesize that these detrimental
changes are exacerbated by joint overuse after tendon detachment.
Our well-characterized, controlled in vivo pre-clinical model system is ideal for the posed
questions. The hypotheses will be evaluated with a series of tendon detachments followed by
comprehensive combination of mechanical property measurements, tissue composition
measures, and longitudinal in vivo functional evaluation of joint kinematics, shoulder range of
motion, and grip strength of the affected limb, defining how in vivo changes are reflected in ex
vivo measurements. Experiments will be repeated with the addition of a treadmill overuse
protocol post-injury to identify the compounding effects of overuse after a tendon tear. The
proposed research will identify how subscapularis tears affect joint health and function, the
consequences of an undiagnosed tear, and the role of shoulder overuse after subscapularis tear
in intensifying these issues, while also providing important insights into chronic shoulder pain
and loss of function. Results from these studies will be used to appropriately design targeted
randomized controlled trials. Subsequently, results from one or more prospective clinical trials
will have a clear and direct impact on clinical care. Results from this pre-clinical study will
provide critical information that will ultimately guide treatment strategies for subscapularis tears
in order to reduce pain, improve function, and preserve long-term shoulder joint health."

Research shows widening health disparities among midlife women since the mid-1980s. However, the
mechanisms through which these health gradients operate are not fully known. Although about 85 percent of
midlife (ages 40-50) women today are mothers, the pathways to and contexts of motherhood—what we call
motherhood biographies—have become increasingly diverse across many dimensions relevant to health,
including age at first birth, parity, spacing of children, and relationship status. Despite evidence that each of these
individual dimensions of the motherhood biography shape maternal health early in the life course, their longer-
term consequences for maternal health at midlife have been largely ignored. Additionally, research to date has
failed to examine whether midlife mother-child relationship characteristics (e.g., coresidence, relationship quality)
either explain or condition the impact of motherhood biographies on midlife women's health. What is unknown
in the scientific literature is how motherhood biographies and midlife motherhood contexts are related to health
and health disparities among midlife women and how these effects vary by education and race-ethnicity. The
proposed R01 study, Motherhood Biographies and Midlife Women's Health, will be the first to
comprehensively determine how motherhood biographies and midlife motherhood contexts matter for
midlife women's health by education and race-ethnicity. We use nationally-representative data from the
1979-2016 waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY79; N=4,271 women). The data are
unmatched in their ability to address our research aims as they include nationally representative longitudinal
data—the gold standard in research on family and health—and allow us to follow women from adolescence
to their 50s, tracking key moments in motherhood and health. We examine a comprehensive collection of
health variables in order to capture the critical heath disparities found at midlife including related to a) health
behaviors, b) physical health, and c) mental and cognitive health. This project is innovative in that it
presents new solutions to the perplexing puzzle of the midlife health gradient by theorizing and examining
motherhood biographies and contexts as key pathways though which health outcomes are stratified at midlife.
This proposal will have a significant impact in demonstrating risk factors and mechanisms for midlife health
disparities. Additionally, given that education and race-ethnicity are also associated with health disparities and
motherhood, this study is significant in testing how diversifying motherhood biographies by education and race-
ethnicity play a role in the widening of midlife health disparities. Examining motherhood biographies at this life
course juncture helps us to better understand health disparities as this generation ages into later-life. Because
health disparities widen with age, it is both possible and imperative to identify the social causes of what may be
small health issues in midlife in order to ameliorate larger health issues in later life."

Erythropoiesis, the production of red blood cells (RBCs), is fine-tuned to meet physiological demands. During
regeneration or “stress erythropoiesis” caused by anemia, a subset of genes and proteins are upregulated in
association with an increased rate of RBC production. A critical gap in understanding erythroid regeneration
hinges on whether the activation of gene regulatory networks in erythroid progenitors (driven by transcription
factors) are stress-specific or represent broader control mechanisms in other contexts. Moreover, the underlying
etiologies in which the erythroid system loses its ability to regenerate in chronic anemias are often unclear. We
discovered that the Sterile Alpha Motif Domain-14 (Samd14) gene is elevated in models of acute/chronic anemia.
Samd14 is regulated by the transcription factor GATA2, which coordinates a network of genes with critical
functions in hematopoiesis and hematologic disease. The GATA2-occupied Samd14 cis-element (Samd14-Enh)
is required for survival in a model of hemolytic anemia, but dispensable for steady state erythropoiesis. Erythroid
progenitors lacking Samd14-Enh have impaired c-Kit signaling, a quintessential pathway regulating
hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis. These results reveal the involvement of a GATA2-Samd14-c-Kit regulatory
axis in erythroid regeneration. Whereas SAM domain-containing proteins are involved in hematopoiesis and cell
signaling, and several are upregulated in anemia, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. Our data
suggests additional cohorts of enhancers with properties mimicking the Samd14-Enh are anemia-regulated. We
hypothesize that Samd14 and additional GATA2 and Regeneration-Activated (G2R) enhancers control erythroid
regeneration. In Aim 1, mechanistic analyses in human and mouse will define Samd14 requirements for cell
signaling and survival of erythroid progenitors. Aim 2 will delineate a GATA2 and anemia-regulated (G2R) gene
network governing a sector of the complex biology surrounding anemia responses. Approaches using primary
human/mouse cells and innovative mouse genetic model approaches will test SAMD14 mechanisms (and other
SAM domain proteins) in c-Kit signaling and erythroid regeneration. These aims will establish valuable contrasts
between homeostatic and regenerative erythropoietic mechanisms, enhancer knockout and gene knockout
phenotypes, and between functionally-distinct cis-elements which contain similar sequence and molecular
properties. By elucidating a GATA2-Samd14-c-Kit axis in acute anemia, and global/locus-specific GATA2
mechanisms of Samd14-Enh-like cis-elements, we expect these studies will reveal fundamental gene regulatory
mechanisms in erythroid regeneration with implications in hematologic disease, including anemias."

Therapy resistance is a major barrier to long term remission in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-
ALL). The prognosis for children with relapsed or refractory disease is dismal. Leukemia-initiating cells (L-ICs)
regenerate disease upon transplantation into mice. They also recapitulate the immunophenotypic complexity of
the parent leukemia supporting that, as in normal hematopoiesis, there is a cellular hierarchy among leukemic
cells. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the L-IC is a committed thymocyte progenitor and resides
in the leukemic DN3 population, however, only a fraction of DN3 cells can give rise to disease. L-ICs rely on
NOTCH1-induced MYC signaling for survival. Recent studies identified dormant, therapy resistant L-ICs in both
murine models and T-ALL patient samples. The role of cell cycle restriction in L-IC latency is incompletely
understood. In an effort to uncover pathways that govern L-IC function, we performed single cell RNA-
sequencing on thymocytes at varying stages of T-cell leukemogenesis using our transgenic Tal1/Lmo2 model.
This approach identified a dormant DN3 cluster, marked by low Ki67 expression, which is observed in other
murine T-ALL samples. Dormant DN3 cells exhibit high Notch1, but low Myc expression. The transcriptional
signature of these cells shows enrichment of genes previously implicated in leukemia initiation or leukemia stem
cell function. Dormant DN3 cells show enrichment of the non-canonical Wnt receptor Ryk, which is reported to
maintain hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal by limiting proliferation and promoting quiescence. RYK is
overexpressed in primary pediatric T-ALL and in Tal1/Lmo2-induced murine T-ALL compared to healthy thymus.
This indicates that RYK may not be restricted to this rare subpopulation and moreover, there may be a
therapeutic window for RYK inhibition in relapsed T-ALL. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that dormant
DN3 cells are quiescent L-ICs that retain proliferative and differentiative capacity, which permits their therapy
tolerance and subsequent expansion during relapse. This proposal will identify a gene signature of dormant DN3
cells and uncover the potential role of these cells in T-ALL relapse by evaluating their L-IC function and
chemoresistance (Aim 1). Aim 2 will define the non-canonical WNT/RYK signaling network in T-ALL and uncover
the role of these pathways in dormant DN3 cells and L-IC function by testing whether inhibition of RYK reduces
the L-IC frequency of murine and patient T-ALL cells. Collectively, these studies will provide critical insight to T-
ALL heterogeneity and will lay the foundation for development of L-IC targeted therapy for relapsed disease."

Nearly 20 years of clinical research has shown that near-infrared optical imaging based upon frequency
domain diffuse optical spectroscopy (FD-DOS) can be a powerful tool for the study, diagnosis, and
personalized treatment of human disease. When used for neuroimaging (i.e. functional near-infrared
spectroscopy, fNIRS), FD-DOS can provide a greater imaging depth compared to standard continuous-wave
(CW) fNIRS thus reaching deeper cortical layers and providing better distinction from superficial layers. In
breast cancer, FD-DOS is effective for predicting individual response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and similar
strong evidence supporting FD-DOS has been collected in critical care, exercise physiology, breast cancer
diagnosis, and other applications. Despite this convincing clinical data, FD-DOS has not yet been translated to
standard clinical use for any indication. The reasons are two-fold. First, diffuse optical imaging methods, as a
whole, still suffer from low spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, clinical applications that
can benefit from the advanced quantitation and deeper sensitivity afforded by FD-DOS are reluctant to adopt
the method because it lacks scalability for high density, high resolution imaging and is prohibitively complex,
slow, and difficult to use. This project will remove these barriers by creating a reflectance-based FD-DOS
imaging platform for quantitative deep tissue spectroscopy and tomography with unprecedented scalability,
precision, and speed that enables dramatic improvements in accuracy and spatial resolution. This will be
enabled by the development and evaluation of massively-scalable multi-frequency FD hardware and software
that samples tissue at ultrahigh spatial densities with high precision. Current methods are insufficient because
data acquisition is too slow, the hardware needed (e.g. optical devices/fibers and electronics) is too bulky and
heavy, and standard data processing and 3D reconstruction algorithms cannot reasonably handle these large
datasets. This project introduces innovations in multi-wavelength optical sources and sensitive detectors, multi-
frequency FD modulation and demodulation, high spatial density tissue sampling methods, FD phased-array
structured interrogation of tissue, and 2D/3D image reconstruction. Improved performance will be
demonstrated through human validation studies of breast imaging and quantitative fNIRS. The results will also
significantly advance wearable sensing capabilities and improve quantification in other optical modalities such
as photoacoustic imaging. No other medical imaging technology can provide quantitative, deep tissue, and
real-time measurements of both endogenous and exogenous molecules and tissue scattering parameters in a
compact, scalable platform. Together, these advances will usher in a next generation of quantitative tissue
optical spectroscopy that lead to improved diagnostics and individualized care, especially in neurology, breast
oncology, and personal health.

10754253,"The dynamics of signaling systems are critical for controlling gene expression programs and cellular outcomes.
The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcription factor orchestrating the response to cellular stresses, and
we previously found that its dynamics (changes in its protein levels over time) following DNA damage depend
on the stimulus and play a role in determining whether a cell will survive or die. However, many questions remain
about how different cellular contexts influence p53 dynamics and ultimate cellular outcomes, how p53 chooses
between conflicting cellular outcomes, and how p53 dynamics can best be leveraged for therapeutic purposes.
The goals of our work are to obtain a comprehensive quantitative understanding of how p53 dynamics regulate
cellular outcomes in single cells and to apply our findings to address clinical needs. The cellular environment
can influence p53 dynamics, therefore we will first investigate how p53 dynamics are regulated by factors such
as 3D cellular architecture in cultured tumor spheroids and in in vivo tumors. We will then investigate the
dynamics and cellular outcomes of cancer-associated p53 mutants in cultured and in vivo settings. The effects
of p53 dynamical patterns on gene expression will be determined in single cells by using novel technology that
supports integrating live imaging data of p53 dynamics with single-cell RNA sequencing. We will also investigate
how p53 dynamics influence gene expression at the RNA and protein levels, as well as the dynamics of p53
post-translational modifications in bulk populations. These studies will reveal the impact that p53 dynamical
patterns have on the RNA and protein of its target genes, and how the combinations of these dynamical patterns
guide cellular outcomes. We will also use our live-imaging systems to determine how clinically-relevant
therapeutic approaches can be optimized to induce the desired p53 dynamics and cellular outcomes in cancer.
We will determine how the doses and timings of radiation fractions affect p53 dynamics and function, and
optimize the schedule of fractions for inducing tumor cell death via p53-mediated mechanisms. Many cancers
overexpress the p53 inhibitors Mdm2 or Mdmx and are susceptible to their inhibition. Through quantifying and
modulating p53 dynamics we will determine how to fine-tune their inhibition to sensitize Mdm2 or Mdmx
overexpressing cells to DNA damage while sparing healthy cells. Tumor cells can be cleared by the immune
system, and this process is influenced by the tumors' gene expression programs. Therefore, we will investigate
how p53 dynamics influence interactions between tumor cells and immune cells, and work towards optimizing
combinations of p53-targeting therapeutics with immunotherapies to maximize tumor cell killing by the immune
system. In total, these studies will provide new mechanistic insights into the links between p53 dynamics and
function in controlling cell fates, and will inform novel combinatorial therapeutic approaches to cancer treatments."
10755247,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Precise control of gene expression during development and in response to signals is essential for organismal
growth and homeostasis. Accordingly, gene expression is regulated at multiple steps, with tight control over
transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and coordinated processing of messenger RNA
(mRNA). Recent work by our lab and others has revealed that elongating RNAPII can be targeted for premature
termination. Intriguingly, across eukaryotes, mammals display an increased prevalence of premature termination
and “transcription attrition” within mRNAs. This phenomenon is enriched among genes involved in signaling, the
DNA damage response, development and tissue-specific functions. Although the reasons for this remain to be
defined, genes in these classes are often long and harbor extensive first introns, leading to suggestions that
intron expansion during evolution enabled the acquisition of cryptic termination-promoting sequences. Clearly,
full-length mRNA synthesis is essential for proper protein production. Accordingly, intronic termination has
emerged as a contributor to many diseases, including immune dysfunction, neurodegeneration and cancer.
Here, we propose to systematically define the cis-acting sequences and trans-acting protein factors that
determine the fate of the RNAPII elongation complex and nascent RNA. We will define how RNAPII elongation
is regulated at mRNA loci to prevent inappropriate 3’ end formation and production of aberrant transcripts, and
conversely, how transcription of enhancer and antisense RNAs is rapidly terminated to prevent generation of
unwanted non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species. To accomplish these goals, we developed synergistic in vivo and
in vitro systems. In Aim 1, we will use a powerful screening strategy in mouse embryonic stem cells to define
the sequences and proteins that influence RNAPII elongation properties and RNA fate. To complement these
cell-based approaches, Aim 2 will make use of a novel cell-free transcription system to dissect the biochemical
mechanisms that control RNAPII elongation and the interplay with RNA processing and termination complexes.
Aim 3 will build on our preliminary data demonstrating that transcription through the first exon-intron junction
stimulates RNAPII elongation rate, to investigate in detail how the sequences and protein factors involved in
splicing impact RNAPII activity. This work will answer central questions about the nature of termination-promoting
sequences and the factors that govern their recognition, and will describe the interactions between elongation,
splicing and termination complexes. These studies will identify the requirements for elongation of a functional
mRNA and the mechanisms employed to prevent transcription attrition. In parallel, we will uncover the sequences
and factors that promote early termination at enhancers and other regulatory loci to prevent polymerase
collisions, double-stranded RNA formation and genome instability. By elucidating these mechanisms of RNAPII
control we aim to reveal the causes of, and suggest potential treatments for, the growing list of diseases involving
disruption of transcription elongation, splicing and 3’ end choice."

Lymphatic disease affects over 10 million patients in the United States and are grossly
understudied. Lymphedema, the most commonly occurring lymphatic disease, is considered one on of the
most significant cancer survivorship issues in the United States. Of significant note, our primary understanding
and mapping of the lymphatic system come from animal models. A comprehensive anatomic reference from
the human lymphatic system does not currently exist. We propose the development of a lymphatic tissue
mapping center (TMC) as a part of the NIH Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP). Specifically,
through a consortium of institutions including the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, University of
Southern California, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, and Indiana University, we will acquire
both lymphatic collectors and lymphatic capillaries in healthy individuals across the entire health spectrum and
register each of these samples to the associated angiosome thereby allowing coordination with
HuBMAP. These samples will undergo spatial transcriptome analysis. Moreover, we will perform 3D
radiologic imaging of lymphatic collectors throughout the body. The spatial transcriptome analysis and 3D
imaging data will be processed and transferred to the HuBMAP Integration, Visualization, and Engagement
(HIVE) Collaborative. The lymphatic tissue mapping center, alongside HuBMAP, will provide fine detail
anatomic precision of the lymphatic system better informing future surgical interventions. The spatial
transcriptome analysis will provide potential targets for future pharmacologic therapeutics."

The placenta, uterus, and fallopian tubes act in concert to achieve successful pregnancy outcomes. They
undergo marked changes in structure and function during pregnancy, coordinating with one another and other
maternal organs via direct and distant cell-cell interactions. Here, we propose to generate and integrate data
from in vivo imaging and ex vivo histopathologic and multi-omic bulk, single-nucleus, and spatial profiling data,
in order to generate reference multiscale 3D maps of healthy human pregnant female reproductive organs
across pregnancy. These will serve as key frames of reference for future studies aiming to discover how
perturbation of tissue structure and function leads to organ dysfunction and disease. Our team is well-equipped
to achieve this goal, with expertise in clinical Obstetrics & Gynecology and Placental/Perinatal Pathology,
imaging, spatial molecular profiling, single-cell omics, extracellular matrix (ECM) biology, data management,
and computational biology. We will leverage our well-established translational research infrastructure to recruit
diverse cohorts of healthy pregnant women. We will then perform in vivo imaging using MRI and ultrasound to
delineate tissue structure, perfusion, inflammation, calcifications, and other features. After delivery/surgery,
tissues will be rapidly sampled, processed, and stored in multiple ways (fresh, flash frozen, preserved in
solutions for optimal nucleic acid analysis, and FFPE) to enable generation of high-quality data using a variety
of molecular approaches, with additional samples retained for future studies. Detailed review of clinical data
and formal histopathologic evaluation of adjacent tissue sections will be performed to confirm that normal
tissue has been obtained from subjects with normal outcomes. Initial ex vivo analysis includes extracellular
matrix proteomics, and bulk and single-nucleus RNAseq and ATACseq. The results of these studies will be
analyzed to identify targets for the subsequent imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and spatial transcriptomic
studies. These data types will be integrated to enable mapping of the relationships among different cell types
and between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix on the microscopic level. We note that generation
of multiple data types from adjacent samples, and the use of the Multi-Ome assay (which performs RNAseq
and ATACseq data indexed to the same nuclei) and spatial transcriptomic methods with
immunohistochemistry-based pre-imaging, will enable us to bridge between diverse datasets. The unique
populations of endothelial cells in the placenta and the endothelial mimicry of the extravillous trophoblast will
provide unique opportunities to integrate with other endothelial-centric HuBMAP projects (e.g. lymphatic
system, endothelial atlas, and kidney atlas). Close interactions with other HuBMAP Centers will be established
to enable harmonization of data and metadata standards, sharing of resources (e.g. antibodies with HuBMAP
Centers that are developing/using CODEX and MIBI-TOF), rapid adoption of new technologies, collaborative
data analysis, and rapid sharing of data with the HIVE and the broader scientific community."

10740867,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Both physiological DNA breaks occurring during DNA metabolic processes and pathological DNA breaks
responding to a wide range of stresses, contribute to the outcome of human genome instability. DNA fragility
generated by alternative DNA secondary structures is a known cause of many human diseases, and also occurs
in normal DNA processes. Formation of these structures can arise from single-stranded DNA when the DNA
duplex is unwound during DNA processes such as replication and transcription, and thus can be affected by
cellular activities, nucleotide sequences, and chemical exposures. Here we will examine if DNA regions
having potential to form stable secondary structures when unwound during cell processes, can serve
as signals for topoisomerase II (TOP2) to recognize and cleave, and lead to the removal of the excessive
supercoiling. We have carried out a computational evaluation of the entire available human genome sequence
for optimal ability to fold single-stranded sequences into multiple-hairpin structures, and identified sites of highly
stable DNA secondary structures throughout the genome. We will measure TOP2-mediated DNA breaks at
these sites upon changes in DNA supercoiling from cell activities, then analyze TOP2-cleaved sites to identify
structural features, and examine if DNA secondary structures influence the removal of TOP2 cleavage
complexes. TOP2-mediated breaks are also often associated with pathological damage due to the use of TOP2
inhibitors as anticancer drugs. Many DNA secondary structure-rich and fragile regions are located within cancer-
specific translocation-participating gene regions, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-rearranged regions.
We will determine whether DNA fragility at these regions can serve as a biomarker for assessing the
potential development of cancer-causing rearrangements. We will first test if DNA fragility at gene regions
of AML rearrangements is sensitive to various chemotherapeutic agents, and if this sensitivity leads to the
formation of AML rearrangements in human cells. Then, to test if this sensitivity can predict the rearrangement
formation in patients, we will examine DNA breakage at these regions in normal cells of AML patients with the
AML rearrangements, compared to that of normal individuals, as a means to evaluate individual susceptibility
to AML. These experiments will facilitate the clinical application of using DNA fragility as a biomarker. With
personalized medicine in mind, we will evaluate the effect of naturally occurring sequence variants on the
fragility of the break-prone and AML translocation-participating gene regions, to further identify
structure characteristics contributing to DNA fragility, and to reveal an unexploited consequence of
non-coding variants. Our preliminary results suggest that sequence variants can influence DNA break
frequency of the region by changing the extent or the type of secondary structure forming ability. This proposal
will elucidate the mechanistic and functional features of DNA structure-driven fragility and provide a foundation
for future clinical use of fragile site breakage in disease diagnostics."
10747332,"The cycling of N-acetylglucosamine on Ser(Thr) residues (O-GlcNAcylation; OGN) on nuclear,
cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins serves as a nutrient sensor to regulate signaling, transcription, and
cellular physiology. Abnormal OGN underlies the etiology of diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. OGN
regulates nearly every aspect of transcription, including RNA polymerase II, histones, DNA
methyltransferases, and nearly all transcription factors. Recent findings by us and others indicate that O-
GlcNAcylation also regulates protein translation and mRNA utilization, but much less is known.
Understanding how nutrients and stress regulate protein translation via OGN is not only critical to our basic
understanding of one of the cell’s most vital processes, but also is key to understanding mechanisms
underlying chronic diseases of aging, such as diabetes, cancer and neurodegeneration.
 We hypothesize that O-GlcNAc cycling on proteins in the translational machinery regulates proteostasis
by mediating communication between the proteasome and ribosomal machinery, and that nutrients regulate
translation rates and mRNA selection by dynamic O-GlcNAc cycling on many ribosome-associated proteins.
 We propose three specific aims to advance our understanding of OGN’s roles in nutrient regulation of
translation: Aim 1 will use state-of-the-art mass spectrometric methods to identify both nascent and mature
ribosome associated proteins and translation factors that are modified by OGN, and we will specifically
focus on those that appear to be involved in ribosome:proteasome communication. We will then determine
the functions of OGN at the site level on selected OGN translation proteins. Aim 2 will elucidate how high
glucose alters the OGN of the translation machinery. Using both live HEK293 cells and a rabbit reticulocyte
translation system, we will determine if OGN plays a role in mRNA selection by performing RNA seq analyses
of polysome preparations. Aim 3 will determine the mechanisms by which the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)
and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) are rapidly targeted to ribosomes in response to proteasome inhibition.
 These studies are not only elucidating molecular mechanisms of how nutrients regulate protein synthesis,
but they also are key to revealing how hyperglycemia, as occurs in diabetes, abnormally alters protein
expression in many tissues. Molecular mechanisms revealed in these studies will likely lead to totally novel
targets for the treatment of chronic diseases of aging, particularly diabetes."
10745707,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The majority of the 18 million worldwide cardiovascular deaths are thought to be due to atherosclerosis,
perhaps the single most devastating pathologic process affecting mankind. The recent surge in metabolic
disturbances will ensure that atherosclerosis will not just fade away. This application addresses substantial
knowledge gaps and capitalizes on recent discoveries from our group and new preliminary evidence
suggesting that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) influence the development of atherosclerosis and
cardiometabolic abnormalities. The objective of this proposal is to 1) define the contributions of lncRNAs in
cardiometabolic diseases, 2) improve our understanding of recurrent relationships between lncRNA
conservation and function and 3) test the efficacy of lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies in cardiovascular
disease. Aligned with goals of this application our multicenter collaborative group has collective expertise in
lncRNA biology, atherosclerosis and metabolic disease, epigenomic profiling methodologies, and dissecting
gene-phenotype relationships in human disease. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that there may
be lncRNAs with roles in lipid metabolism that are yet to be characterized and when targeted with context
specificity they can mitigate disease phenotypes in relevant models. Using an integrative screening platform
combing mouse and human studies, we identify novel lncRNA involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, develop a
robust pipeline that prioritizes lncRNA functional discovery, and introduce new tools for lncRNA in vivo
perturbations. Aim 1, will determine role of macrophage lncRNAs in atherosclerosis and explore opportunities
for lncRNA-based therapeutics targeting lesions. In Aim 2, we investigate the function of lncRNAs in hepatic
lipid metabolism and test for evidence of cross-species functional conservation despite sequence evolution.
These studies are expected to shed fundamental insight into the significance of noncoding gene regulation in
cardiometabolic control and provide a framework for lncRNA-based therapeutics in cardiovascular disease. In
summary, this discovery-oriented proposal will fill substantial knowledge gaps in the fields of atherosclerosis
and lncRNA biology."

The Bioinformatics SR (BIOIN) is a vital component of the Center’s entire research operation. It houses all
databases, date storage, and analytic infrastructure central to Lineberger’s research. Two major functions of
the SR are 1) the maintenance of all databases, substantial computational and data storage infrastructure in a
secure yet utilitarian computing environment and; 2) a full complement of research services to faculty for “big
data” analysis and the development of new analytic techniques. An example of these services includes the
management of the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) used for tissue tracking which
promotes the seamless transfer of samples from group to group. The LIMS integrates with other applications
such as the Lineberger Data & Biospecimens Repository and Tableau for report generation. LIMS currently
supports 10 SR, encompassing 7,628 active protocols, and 2.5M containers. The SR is central to the handling
and analysis of tissue-based clinical genomics studies such as UNCsequel and those 9 institutional trials. The
facility is a primary partner for faculty in sequencing processes for DNA and RNA and drive new tools for
discovery and results in publications such as Perou & Parker, Bioinformatics 2019,and Kim et al. Nat Methods,
2018) Another example is the involvement of BIOIN in every TCGA paper since 2016 (48 in total).
BIOIN request a CCSG budget of $264,702 which represents 8% of its operating costs and is requested to
support the salary of key personnel for effort in support of cancer research and bioinformatic analysis. This
facility was used by nearly 100 members for bioinformatics analysis in fiscal year 2019. The facility is a
Lineberger exclusive resource and as such the users were 100% members in 2019. The import of the core
and its scientific infrastructure is illustrated by the ~$3.5M annual LCCC investment in its operation."

10767789,"ABSTRACT: CANCER CELL BIOLOGY PROGRAM
The overarching goals of the Cancer Cell Biology (CCB) Program are: (i) to understand, at the molecular and
cellular levels, mechanisms underlying tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and resistance to therapeutic
treatment, and (ii) to identify and validate new targets for cancer therapy. Insight derived from these studies,
when integrated with research and development from other programs, will provide targets and guidance for the
development of strategies for therapeutic intervention of cancer. Toward these two goals, the Program faculty
investigate various aspects of cancer cell biology, including growth factors and receptors; angiogenesis and
vascular biology; apoptosis; cell cycle regulation; chromatin biochemistry and transcriptional regulation; cell
microstructure and function; DNA replication and repair; metabolism; regulatory RNA; and signal transduction.
Led by two co-leaders with complementary expertise, Yue Xiong and James Bear, the program organizes
these different areas into four major research aims: (1) Cell Cycle, (2) Cell Signaling, (3) Cell Movement and
Organization, and (4) Chromatin Biology. The major emphasis of the Program is to foster integrated research
that spans these inter-related themes, enhancing the research and translational capabilities of program
investigators through the establishment, expansion and utilization of appropriate core facilities, and promoting
interactions with investigators from other LCCC basic, clinical and population sciences programs. CCB has
made concerted and focused efforts to improve translational output, by fostering inter-programmatic
collaboration directed towards translation of basic science discoveries, engaging in entrepreneurship and
brining small molecule inhibitors to pre-clinical and clinical trials. The research of CCB addresses fundamental
biology that applies to all cancers but has a particular impact on cancers relevant to our catchment area such
as multiple myeloma, lung cancer and melanoma. In addition, members of CCB have been active in
community outreach and engagement activities such as advising state legislators on e-cigarette regulation.
Finally, the members of CCB are fully committed to education, training and mentoring at levels ranging from
middle schoolers through junior faculty at our own institution.
The Cancer Cell Biology Program consists of 43 members who are associated with 12 basic science and 3
clinical departments at UNC-Chapel Hill and affiliated institutions. During the last funding period, program
members published 740 cancer-related articles. Of these, 23% were inter-programmatic and 10% were intra-
programmatic (31% collaborative). In 2019, our program members held grants totaling $18.2M (direct cost) in
cancer-relevant extramural funding, including $3.5M (direct costs) from the NCI and $13.6M other peer."
10767928,"ABSTRACT COMMUNICATIONS FOR HEALTH APPLICATIONS AND INTERVENTIONS
The Communications for Health Applications and Interventions (CHAI) SR provides tremendous value and
service to the Center through its development of modern communication techniques for the range of
implementation, clinical, prevention and control research. The services available include behavioral e- and m-
health interventions, qualitative and software design services using adaptive technology. Services for faculty
research projects include: responsive web application, device integration, geofencing, user experience (UX)
and qualitative survey development. The SR was used by more than 30 faculty in fiscal year 2019 which
represented 82% of the total users. CHAI requests $139,365 of a total operating budget of $959,660. The
Center ensure cost-effectiveness and value to the membership through a sustained annual contribution of
approximately $310,000. It is well integrated within the LCCC programs contributed to key studies including:
 • PRO-PM: a qualitative study designed to understand patient, caregiver and provider perceptions on
 patient reported outcomes during chemotherapy. CHAI supported the research through creation of
 interview guides and conduct of over 100 one on one interviews with adult patients receiving
 chemotherapy, healthcare administrators, health service researchers, clinicians, and patient advocates
 across six cancer centers nationwide.
 • PERC: a mixed method study to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of a web based, couple-focused
 intervention on prostate cancer symptom management, quality of life and psychosocial factors. CHAI
 hosted the web site and supported data collection though a built-in automatic tracking system for times
 logged in, time spent on site.
 • COMET: a 5 year PCORI-funded project, will involve 1200 patients. The goal of the COMET
 (Comparison of Operative vs Monitoring and Endocrine Therapy) trial for low-risk ductal carcinoma in
 situ (DCIS). CHAI contributed to the creation of a responsive website that provide accessible,
 understandable, and evidence-based information about DCIS, treatment options, including the trade-
 offs of each treatment option.
The 9 person CHAI SR includes experts in qualitative analysis, software development graphic design and
project management. CHAI is directed by Deborah Tate, PhD a nationally recognized expert in
communications and behavioral science. The SR uses multiple techniques to test the efficacy of e- or m-
messaging and is careful to assess changes in communication usage for example that many in rural areas
have restricted access to broadband yet higher penetration through mobile devices. Integration with
Community Outreach and Engagement is key in the development of CHAI methods."
10767934,"ABSTRACT: STATEWIDE CANCER DATA SHARED RESOURCE
Statewide Cancer Data (SCD) is a two component SR that combines Rapid Case Ascertainment (RCA) and
the Cancer Information and Population Health Resource (CIPHR). This resource reflects a commitment of the
cancer center and of the CPC, CR, BC and CE Programs to support research in real-world populations with a
focus on disparities and access to care – particularly in the state of North Carolina. A strong relationship
between RCA and the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry (CCR), and the hospital tumor registrars allows
RCA to facilitate population-based studies of cancer for Lineberger Cancer Center and outside investigators.
For rapid case ascertainment, the Central Cancer Registry utilizes RCA personnel, and proactively requests
and obtains diagnostic information within one month of the patient’s diagnosis. The other component of this
resource is CIPHR, which includes cancer case data from CCR linked to healthcare administrative claims data
from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. The resulting claims dataset represents over 8 million
individuals. Beneficiaries are reconciled across payers and linked to approximately 750,000 North Carolina
cancer cases from the last decade. The size and complexity of the population-based datasets created and
housed by this resource require an interdisciplinary staff to successfully and efficiently manage, analyze, and
understand the data. SR staff apply diverse and innovative data management and analytic methods many
specifically created for CIPHR to answer important population-based questions about the LCCC catchment
area. Linkage of LCCC population-based cohorts has been accomplished.
Researcher support from SCD typically extends from development of the initial research question, gathering
preliminary data for grant applications through cohort discovery, statistical analysis, and manuscript writing. In
FY2019, 37 LCCC members representing 93% of users used the SCD SR. This is a cost-effective mechanism
to both collect cancer cases efficiently across the state and to disseminate that information. Since CIPHR
began linking to Medicare data in 2012, it has been extensively used by faculty, trainees, and various
collaborators both within UNC and at other cancer centers. To date, more than $15M in external funding has
been enabled by this shared resource. The SCD requests $206,586 from the CCSG, which is 12% of the total
FY20 $1.8 M operating budget, $900,000 of which is provided by the LCCC."
10767795,"ABSTRACT: IMMUNOLOGY PROGRAM
The Immunology Program (IMM) is devoted to enhancing our understanding of the function of the innate and
adaptive immune system in the pathogenesis of malignant disease. There are four specific aims:
 (1) Elucidate new roles for innate immune receptors and the microbiome in carcinogenesis;
 (2) Uncover novel functions of diverse immune cells and pathways in the tumor microenvironment;
 (3) Develop novel approaches to use immunotherapy to treat patients with cancer;
 (4) Discover new targets for improving the outcome of patients with malignant disease undergoing
 allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT).
There are 24 program members from six different departments at UNC School of Medicine. Members have
$13.2M (direct costs) cancer-related funding including; $2.8M in direct costs from NCI and $6.8M in in direct
other peer and other NIH. NCI funding has increased 145% since the last submission. Highlights of the
program include discoveries of new roles of innate immune receptors in colorectal cancer; importance of
microbiota on cancer-relevant immune cell populations; a comprehensive immunogenomic characterization of
the tumor microenvironment for TCGA and critical roles for T follicular helper and B cells during checkpoint
inhibitor therapy in breast cancer. Significant translational findings include the new use of antigens expressed
on solid tumors as targets for chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell therapy (CAR T) including B7-H3 for
pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma, and CD138 for multiple myeloma.
IMM is led by Jenny Ting PhD, William Rand Kenan Professor of Genetics, Microbiology-Immunology (M-I)
and Director of the Translational Immunology Center who is a world’s expert on innate immune receptors, and
Jonathan Serody MD, Elizabeth Thomas Professor of Medicine, M-I and the Associate Director for
Translational Sciences in the Cancer Center, who is an expert on the biology of GVHD, tumor vaccines and the
tumor microenvironment. IMM leadership works closely with CR to translate findings from IMM. These include
the evaluation of CD30-specific CART T cells in the treatment of CD30-expressing lymphomas, B7-H3-specific
CAR T cells in relapsed ovarian cancer and GD2-specific CAR T cells in neuroblastoma. Six outstanding
faculty members have been recruited since the last grant submission. IMM has a strong publication record with
359 papers; 18% intra-programmatic, 39% inter-programmatic publications and 33% of the papers were in
journals with an impact factor > 10. IMM has a strong record of training with two training grants focused on
tumor immunology or immunotherapy. Research within IMM has been significantly informed by the Office of
Outreach and Community Engagement with an emphasis on cancers in the catchment area, including breast,
colorectal, pancreatic cancers and multiple myeloma."
10767940,"ABSTRACT: BIOSTATISTICS SHARED RESOURCE
The Biostatistics Shared Resource (BIOS) provides access for LCCC faculty across the basic, clinical,
translational and population science spectrum to an experienced staff and recognized national leaders in
statistical modeling and analysis. The Center’s breadth of science requires a broad range of expertise
available in BIOS and includes for example: population sciences, psychometric analysis, clinical trial design
and analysis, basic experimental science as well as “big data” –omics. This range requires a core that can be
accessed by virtually all members on the “front end” for experimental design from small undertakings to large
trials. Access is encouraged through a weekly walk in clinic centrally located in the Lineberger atrium where
faculty and students at all levels can discuss projects at their inception. The masters and doctoral level full time
BIOS SR staff operate this clinic and there is also a traditional appointment system for researchers with
defined problems. This team is supported by senior biostatisticians with a wide range of expertise from the
School of Public Health’s internationally recognized Biostatistics Department. These leaders also serve on the
Protocol Review Committee and the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee. Senior faculty are fully engaged in
LCCC research as collaborators and researchers in methods, for example in the Biostatistics PO1 in clinical
trials methods development. In addition both staff and faculty encourage the participation of graduate students
who have the opportunity to engage faculty and peers in statistical review as part of their own training under
the guidance of the senior faculty-level statisticians. This facility is a LCCC exclusive SR and was well used by
over 100 faculty in fiscal year 2019. BIOS requests $239,374 which is approximately 20% of the total
operating costs for this highly subsidized facility sustained by an annual LCCC contribution of ~$1M BIOS has
been a key partner in multiple grants and publications over the prior five years, from Dr Rashid’s analysis of
Nobel Laureate Aziz Sancar’s work on circadian timing of DNA repair processes to Dr Tan’s design for Dr
Song’s project in caregiver’s management of patient symptoms."
10767802,"ABSTRACT: MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM
The Molecular Therapeutics (MT) program is dedicated to evaluating cancer targets, developing novel
therapies, and devising more effective delivery systems via highly integrated basic science and translational
activities. The Program is led by Stephen Frye, Director of the Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and
Drug Discovery (CICBDD) and Fred Eshelman Distinguished Professor, and Gary Johnson, Kenan
Distinguished Professor in the Department of Pharmacology. The MT Program consists of 42 members who
are associated with four schools and 16 departments. During the last funding period, program members have
published 675 cancer-related articles. MT is highly collaborative. 16% of these papers are intra-programmatic
and 33% are inter-programmatic (43% collaborative). In 2019, our program members held grants totaling
$20.9M (direct cost) in cancer-relevant extramural funding, including $6.4M (direct costs) from the NCI and
$13.0M other peer funding. The MT program is comprised of investigators with expertise in five broad areas:
Chemical and Structural Biology; Drug Discovery and Development; Drug Delivery and Nanotechnology;
Systems Pharmacology; and Oncogenic Signaling. Many investigators in the program have active
collaborations with other LCCC programs, using and providing direction for LCCC's shared resources. These
interactions enable many of the scientific steps needed for the discovery and development of promising
therapies. In 2015, MT was rated “outstanding” stating “the minor weakness of this program is that, relatively
few of the promising therapeutics have moved into investigator initiated clinical trials at the LCCC.” Since this
review, multiple clinical studies have been initiated at UNC and other institutions based on discoveries in MT,
as outlined in our response to the prior critique. Future plans build on unique translational resources available
due to the creation of the Eshelman Institute for Innovation and Pinnacle Hill, which bring more than $100
million to progress UNC-based discoveries into patients. Cellular and biologic therapies will be an area of
future focus for MT members enabled by the expansion of the Clinical Immunotherapy Program's GMP facility.
Through these efforts, MT will continue to accelerate discovery of new cancer therapeutics and, with the
Clinical Research and Breast Cancer Programs, design and execute translational and therapeutic trials in our
patients."
10767809,"ABSTRACT: VIROLOGY PROGRAM
Approximately 20% of all cancers result from infectious agents, with the majority of these malignancies being
virus-associated cancers. The Virology Program (VIR) focuses on deciphering the basic mechanisms by which
human tumor viruses are linked to the development of malignancy. The long-term goal of VIR is to understand
viral perturbation sufficiently to generate new therapies, including small molecules, biologics, and vaccines that
target viruses and viral cancers. The aims for VIR are focused on five research areas. These include
understanding: (i) Viruses and Immunity (ii) Virus-Cell Interactions (iii) Viral Pathogenesis and Tumorigenesis
(iv) Cancers impacted by HIV infection, and (v) Clinical & Translational Virology, which includes gene therapy,
immune therapy and global oncology. Recent discoveries include the finding that virus-infected cells secrete
exosomes or extracellular vesicles, which modulate the tumor environment, and the discovery that viral-
encoded microRNAs contribute to the development of neoplasms. Additional findings focus on the modulation
of innate immune signaling pathways by oncogenic viruses, epigenetic modifications in the context of viral
cancers, and development of new therapies for AIDS-associated cancers. VIR also provides the scientific
underpinnings of the UNC Lineberger Global Oncology effort, which is tightly integrated with other NCI-
designated cancer centers, NCI-funded collaborative groups including the AIDS Malignancy Consortium in the
US and Africa, and the NIH global research agenda. There are 23 program members from 10 different
departments across campus. These faculty investigators have 39 research grants and $9.7 million (direct
costs) in annual extramural support including $2.4 million from NCI and $5.5 million from other peer and other
NIH. Members authored a total of 407 cancer-relevant publications during the past 5 years; 13% were intra-
programmatic, and 16% were inter-programmatic. VIR is the administrative home of LCCC viral vector/gene
therapy efforts and based on overlapping biology is working closely with the Immunology (IMM) research
program. LCCC’s humanized mouse program is led by Victor Garcia’s work in VIR. There are extremely
accomplished investigators in VIR including Dr. Jack Griffith, elected to the National Academy of Sciences, Dr.
Raab-Traub, National Cancer Advisory Board member, and Dr. Damania who serves on the NCI Board of
Scientific Counselors. Research in VIR is informed by the Office of Community Outreach and Engagement
particularly with respect to HPV-associated cancers with an emphasis on translational studies related to human
papilloma virus (HPV) including recruitment of new faculty and investment of pilot funding. HPV-associated
cervical and oral cancers are of particular interest to LCCC as the incidence of HPV-associated cervical and
oral cancer in our catchment area exceeds the national average."
10767816,"ABSTRACT: CANCER GENETICS PROGRAM
The Cancer Genetics (CG) Program of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) was
established in 2001 to facilitate an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach to genetics research and its
application to clinical care. The program is comprised of laboratory-based investigators, statistical geneticists,
researchers and clinicians, all focused on improving our understanding of cancer etiology and the treatment of
cancer. By integrating the multiple strengths of UNC, ranging from basic science to clinical genomic analysis,
the LCCC Cancer Genetics Program has become a world leader in (i) mechanisms of cancer-associated
genes; (ii) precision oncology and bioinformatics; and (iii) epigenetics/epigenomics. Cancer treatments are
increasingly tailored to an individual’s genomic constitution and the genomic characteristics of the tumor,
mitigating toxicity and enhancing efficacy by precisely targeting mutations that drive tumor propagation. We
have developed a comprehensive program that includes: (i) integrating diverse experimental organisms from
yeast, fly and mouse, to cell-based systems, and ultimately human populations to identify mechanisms that
result in genomic and transcriptomic alterations and the specific lesions responsible for cancer phenotypes; (ii)
use of Whole Genome, Whole Exome and Whole Transcriptome Sequencing (WGS/WES/WTS) as effective
diagnostic tools; (iii) facilitating the meaningful use of genomic information by patients and providers through
structured categorization of genomic variation based on clinical validity and utility; (iv) a state-of-the-art
informatics approach that incorporates generation, analysis, and management of genomic data, coupling
genomic and clinical information to drive both clinical testing and translational research; (v) development of
ethical and practical policies for the use of WGS data by clinicians for patient care; and (vi) exploration of
epigenomic mechanisms and strategies for therapeutic intervention.
Our vision has been realized through value added LCCC resources for the strategic recruitment of faculty in
emerging fields, investment in cutting-edge technology including data handling, enhanced organization for
integrative analyses and the securing of significant federal funding to enable the application of genomics to
diverse aspects of cancer care and prevention. CG consists of 31 members who are associated with 10 basic
science and 3 clinical departments at UNC-Chapel Hill and affiliated institutions. During the last funding period,
program members have published 544 cancer-related articles, 39% were inter-programmatic and 16% were
intra-programmatic (45% collaborative). In 2019, our program members held grants totaling $15.2M (direct
cost) in cancer-relevant extramural funding, including $5.7M (direct costs) from the NCI and $8.6M in other
peer-reviewed funding."
10767942,"ABSTRACT: TISSUE PROCUREMENT FACILITY SHARED RESOURCE
The Tissue Procurement Facility (TPF) is the main conduit for access to protocol driven tissue-based research.
As part of the 2019 strategic plan, this SR was expanded and reorganized to provide additional services and
with a more robust pipeline for faculty conducting this type of clinical research. The expansion of this resource
led to enhanced services including:
• More timely fresh tissue collection. TPF has developed a pipeline to collect fresh tissue for next-generation
 research focusing on single-cell and chip sequencing. The fresh tissue infrastructure requires significant
 collaboration between Surgical Pathology, Anatomic Pathology, TPF, and Clinical Protocol and Data
 Management (CPDM). For scRNA sequencing TPF has added an additional workflow to facilitate this
methodology.
• Tissue dissociation. TPF is equipped for single-cell dissociation to process tissue to single-cell for
 investigators that do not have the technology to do so and/or are investigating more robust experiments.
• Ultrapure plasma processing. Ultra highspeed plasma purification for downstream cfDNA analysis.
 Ultrapure plasma will produce a significantly cleaner signal-to-noise ratio for investigators looking at cfDNA.
TPFis led by an experienced faculty and staff. Dr. Calhoun is Director of Surgical Pathology and Anatomical
Pathology at UNC and serves as Pathology Director. He works closely with the surgical liaison, co-leader HJ
Kim to ensure responsible policies are in place for the procurement of research specimens following guidelines
established by the UNC Hospitals. Amy Garratt serves as the Facility Director for the SR and its translational
consenting and collection component. This is a well-managed resource with an operating budget of $1.0M.
TPF requests $229,718 (21% of the total) for fiscal year 2020. LCCC members were more than 66% of the
users in fiscal year 2019, virtually all other users were performing cancer research. The Facility procured, and
distributed 46,091 specimens to support 154 different investigator-initiated studies."
10767821,"ABSTRACT: CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH PROGRAM
Recognizing the fundamental nature of clinical research at UNC, and that common vulnerabilities may be
found across many cancers, CR has further invested in the bench-to-bedside continuum. We have become
even more integrated around the themes of tissue-based research, novel therapeutics and technologies with a
pivot towards investigator intiated trials (IITs). CR, rated “Outstanding” at the last competitive renewal, has
broad clinical and research expertise across all cancer types and key correlative strengths in imaging,
statistical design, biomarker development, immuno-oncology, and tissue-based research. CR themes include:
1) Develop and evaluate novel therapies through early phase and investigator-initiated clinical trials; 2)
Conduct tissue-based state-of-the-art ‘omics research to improve cancer treatments; 3) Develop new
technologies for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Highlights of CR work and future plans include
innovative IITs leveraging UNC research, an investment and track record of success in cellular immunotherapy
trials, translating genomics efforts into therapeutic clinical trials, and incorporating biomarker development,
novel imaging, and technologies into our trials. It is led by three dynamic trialists and physician-scientists, Drs.
Dees, Milowsky, and Yeh. Each bring a complementary skill set to the program: Early Phase trials (Dees),
genomics and novel drug trials (Milowsky), and translational collaborative research (Yeh). CR focuses on
catchment area diseases and on training the next generation of clinical scientists. CR members are involved in
multiple trials targeting cancers of particular relevance to the catchment area, the state of North Carolina. The
CR Program consists of 60 members who are associated with 7 basic science and 10 clinical departments at
UNC-Chapel Hill and affiliated institutions. During the last funding period, members published 1260 cancer-
related articles, 34% were inter-programmatic and 18% were intra-programmatic (45% collaborative). In 2019,
program members held grants totaling $18.7M (direct cost) in cancer-relevant extramural funding, including
$5.2M (direct costs) from the NCI and $4.9M other peer-reviewed funding."
10767826,"ABSTRACT: BREAST CANCER PROGRAM
The Breast Cancer Program (BC) was an outgrowth of the basic, translational, population and clinical research
of the LCCC Breast Cancer SPORE, which has been continuously funded since 1992. LCCC investment in
faculty and infrastructure supports one of the country’s premier clinical and research breast programs,
performing important interdisciplinary research in the past decade with members rising to national leadership
positions. This knitting together of clinical, basic, and epidemiologic research is the hallmark of the Breast
Program, and is reflected in the investment in faculty and resources fostered by including, in the last 5 years,
over $10M in genomics/sequencing resources used for institutional as well as large multicenter trials. This
commitment is reflected in patient-facing institutional trials examining clinical implications of breast cancer
subtypes as well as LCCC leadership of collaborative tissue-based studies through the Translational Breast
Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC) and AURORA-US Project (https://auroraus.org), a multicenter,
multiplatform analysis of DNA, RNA, and other alterations in metastases compared with matched primary
tumors. The longitudinal and exceptional investment in the Carolina Breast Cancer Studies (CBCS) represents
the largest and most heavily annotated population-based study ever performed addressing racial disparities in
breast cancer, behavior and outcome. CBCS has received an additional $5M investment in this cycle and is
providing the community with an increased understanding of the full range of breast cancer research from
genomics /genetics to health services. Program strategic goals include: 1) genomic and genetic analyses of
metastatic and primary breast cancers, 2) bench-to-bedside approaches using murine models, 3) translational
discovery and strategies based on human tissue-based correlative science, 4) clinical trials and population-
based studies leveraging and applying UNC science and community input to address the root causes of
disparities. BC members include clinicians, basic researchers, statisticians, bioinformaticians, epidemiologists,
and health services scientists. BC has long-term interest in North Carolina’s minority disparities, following the
program’s seminal discoveries of the high incidence of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in younger African
Americans, the subsequent molecular analysis showing the disparity is even more striking, and the surprising
finding that the largest racial disparity in survival is in women with hormone receptor-positive disease, for
whom access to care and adherence to treatment are key. The BC Program consists of 21 members who are
associated with 10 basic science and 5 clinical departments at UNC-Chapel Hill and affiliated institutions.
During the last funding period, program members published 494 cancer-related articles, of which 56% were
inter-programmatic and 15% were intra-programmatic (57% collaborative). In 2019, our program members
held grants totaling $8.1M (direct cost) in cancer-relevant extramural funding, including $4.0M (direct costs)
from the NCI and $1.8M other peer-reviewed funding."
10767833,"ABSTRACT: CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM
The UNC Lineberger Cancer Prevention and Control Program focuses on the development, evaluation, and
dissemination of evidence-based interventions and policy approaches to improve cancer outcomes in North
Carolina and beyond. Our program is comprised of 56 program members and fosters strong collaborations
between faculty from the six schools; Schools of Medicine, Public Health, Nursing, Pharmacy, Media and
Journalism, and the College of Arts and Sciences and 28 departments.
The CPC program has four broad themes: (1) Implementing health promotion interventions to reduce cancer
risk factors; (2) Developing cancer communication strategies to improve cancer prevention and control; (3)
Improving quality of cancer care and long-term outcomes for cancer survivors; and (4) Studying patterns of
cancer care, screening, and prevention to inform interventions and policy initiatives that improve cancer
outcomes. Eliminating cancer health disparities is a cross-cutting theme of our program.
Highlights of our nationally recognized research by program investigators include: tobacco control policy
research on the design and efficacy of graphic cigarette warning labels that is guiding FDA policy; research on
sales and marketing of electronic cigarettes, including interventions to prevent adolescent e-cigarette use;
research on digital and mobile interventions for diet, obesity, physical activity, and symptom management with
particular focus on disadvantaged populations and cancer survivors; novel patient-reported outcomes studies
that inform national policy; and implementing interventions in our Catchment area of North Carolina focused on
eliminating disparities in access and outcomes.
The Program is led by Dr. Kurt M. Ribisl, a behavioral scientist, and Dr. Ethan Basch, a medical oncologist
and health services researcher. Program members are PIs of three NCI funded pre- and post-doctoral training
grants. The Program adds value in terms of integrative activities and opportunities for intra- and cross-program
collaboration; professional development and networking support for junior faculty CPC members; access to
shared resources such as the Communications for Health Applications and Interventions, Biostatistics, and
Patient-Reported Outcomes Core; as well as space, seminars, retreats, training, and education. Since our last
renewal, UNC Lineberger has benefited the Program through strong support for infrastructure, faculty
recruitments, extensive use of shared resources, and providing developmental funds as befits one of three
major UNC Lineberger strategic directions, “Optimizing Cancer Outcomes in North Carolina.” During the last
funding period, program members have published 1359 cancer-related articles, 26% were intra-programmatic
and 19% were inter-programmatic (38% collaborative). In 2019, our program members held grants totaling
$18.9M (direct cost) in cancer-relevant extramural funding, including $6.8M (direct costs) from the NCI and
$8.9M in other peer-reviewed funding."
10767839,"ABSTRACT: CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY PROGRAM
The Cancer Epidemiology program studies environmental, genetic, and molecular risks for cancer and cancer
outcomes to identify priorities for public health and clinical intervention. The program has three aims: (1) Risk-
Based Prevention and Early Detection: To identify opportunities for risk-based prevention and early detection
of cancer; (2) Treatment, Outcomes and Survivorship: To improve cancer treatment, outcomes, and
survivorship through epidemiologic and clinical research that leads to evidence-based interventions; (3)
Integrative Molecular Epidemiology: To deepen understanding of cancer etiology, heterogeneity, and
survivorship through integrative human molecular and histopathologic studies of precursor lesions and tumors.
A major cross-cutting theme is addressing the epidemiology of health disparities. As a comprehensive cancer
center in an economically, socially, and racially diverse state, CE is well-poised to address health equity.
Across these aims, we use multidimensional North Carolina studies and conduct cross-program research to
yield high impact findings. Members have expertise in population-based epidemiology, data linkage,
pharmacoepidemiology, survey research, clinical research, screening, molecular and biomarker research,
translational preclinical research, sociology, pathology, genomics, data science, computer science, and
statistical and epidemiologic methods. Research resources include population-based studies of breast, colon,
prostate, head and neck cancer as well as registries for breast and lung screening. Many of these studies
participate in large national and international data-sharing initiatives and consortia. The Program brings value
to the Center through study resources that collect exposure and outcome data, and biospecimens, a unique
shared resource (Statewide Cancer Data), and expertise in epidemiologic methods. The Program is supported
by UNC Lineberger’s investments in faculty recruitments, shared resources and developmental funds. The
UNC Lineberger strategic plan emphasis on optimizing cancer outcomes in North Carolina has led to
significant investment across population sciences and is expanding in new areas in coming years including
endometrium and bladder, with sustained support for ongoing data collection in breast cancer and head and
neck cancers. The CE Program consists of 33 members who are associated with 9 departments at UNC-
Chapel Hill and affiliated institutions. During the last funding period, program members have published 776
cancer-related articles, 24% were inter-programmatic and 19% were intra-programmatic (34%
collaborative). In 2019, our program members held grants totaling $10.0M (direct cost) in cancer-relevant
extramural funding, including $5.2M (direct costs) from the NCI and $3.0M other peer-reviewed funding."
10767844,"ABSTRACT: COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT
The UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) has a long history of serving the state of North
Carolina (NC) through clinical care, research, policy, and cancer-focused outreach and community
engagement. Since receiving NCI cancer center designation in 1975 and comprehensive status in 1990, LCCC
has served as the only public comprehensive cancer center in NC with patients, outreach, and research efforts
in all 100 NC counties. Based on its history of conducting impactful research and delivering cancer care to
patients from all 100 NC counties, LCCC defined its catchment area a decade ago as the entire state of NC.
The state has the 9th largest population in the US. and is highly diverse with regard to race, ethnicity, and
rurality, with 29.3% of the NC population reporting minority race, 9.6% Hispanic ethnicity, and 54% of NC
counties considered rural, with 21% of the population living in a rural county. Racially/ethnically diverse and
rural populations in NC face a disproportionate burden of cancer and are key constituent populations for LCCC
efforts. Notably, LCCC and its clinical venue, UNC Hospitals, have been directly responsible to the people and
legislature of NC for ensuring that high quality, accessible cancer care is provided to NC residents regardless
of their ability to pay; in a state without Medicaid expansion, this is an important responsibility.
 For decades, LCCC-supported research and outreach efforts have been committed to defining and
implementing cancer practice and policies that are evidence-based and designed to address specific needs in
the catchment area, particularly in racial/ethnic minority and rural populations. These responsibilities are now
coordinated by the LCCC Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) Office, whose mission it is to
meaningfully engage the community in cancer research, clinical care and programmatic and policy efforts to
understand and serve the population's needs. COE’s vision and objective are to develop and sustain active
community partnerships to reduce the burden of cancer and eliminate cancer disparities in NC and beyond.
The specific aims of the COE Office are to: (1) monitor the cancer burden and identify cancer health disparities
in NC; (2) synergize institutional and community efforts to engage diverse stakeholders in addressing the
cancer burden and reducing cancer health disparities in NC; (3) coordinate and amplify cancer outreach and
supportive care with diverse stakeholder audiences; and (4) facilitate impactful and equity-focused cancer
research in NC and beyond. The COE Office ensures that LCCC research, clinical care, and programmatic
outreach efforts are timely, relevant, responsive, and infused with community perspectives, including policy
makers, community providers and public health practitioners, cancer patients and caregivers, and the public at
large. The impact of the work is expected to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality in NC and beyond."
10767857,"ABSTRACT: PLANNING AND EVALUATION
The LCCC internal and external advisory groups provided invaluable guidance in planning and evaluation of all
the major initiatives and includes:
 • The Senior Leadership Team, which is composed of the Director, Deputy Director and Associate
 Directors and meets weekly to evaluate progress in strategic LCCC initiatives.
 • The Program Planning Committee, which meets monthly to evaluate progress of all important initiatives
 and includes institutional and Research Program Leaders, as well as the Senior Leadership Team.
 • The Internal Advisory Board, comprised of institutional leaders including the Chancellor; Dean of the
 College of Arts and Sciences, Deans of the Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Public Health and
 external advisors, and meets with the Director at least quarterly.
 • The Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), which is comprised of expert external advisors, and which was
 expanded with the addition of two new members in 2018/19 to provide additional expertise in specific
 areas such as community outreach and engagement and clinical trials. There are now 14 members on
 the SAB with complementary expertise in basic, clinical, translational, and population sciences and
 administration. The SAB meets at least annually at the UNC LCCC.
 • The Community Advisory Board (CAB), the 12 membered CAB meets quarterly with the Director and
 COE Leadership. The CAB is geographically, racially and ethnically representative of our catchment
 area (the state of North Carolina) and offers a variety of important perspectives and constituencies,
 including cancer survivors and caregivers, community and faith-based organizations, rural and urban
 areas, state and non-profit agencies, and under-represented minorities.
These coordinated teams of advisors provide critical advice and guidance, both annually in the fall and ad-hoc
as required, ensuring that LCCC most effectively set priorities and pursues objectives that promote basic,
clinical, prevention and translational research at the Center. With careful planning and critical input from
advisory groups, the Director initiated a new 5 year strategic planning process, reorganized operating
committees, continued significant recruitment, launched new population-based studies, strengthened
community outreach efforts, and expanded immunotherapy and GMP infrastructure."
10767864,"ABSTRACT: CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT
The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) component includes the Clinical Protocol Office (CPO)
and the compliance committees (Compliance, Data and Safety Monitoring). These groups provide centralized
management and oversight for cancer clinical trials conducted by UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer
Center (LCCC) members. The CPDM delivers a full range of management and quality control services for
investigator-initiated local and multi-center trials (IITs), industry or other sponsored trials, as well as those
originating in the NCI such as the National Clinical Trials Network groups. CPDM centralizes the protocol
registration, regulatory affairs, compliance committee work, and management of clinical trials, facilitates
efficient and effective training for research personnel and monitors timely activation of protocols in support of
LCCC investigators from all relevant disciplines. IIT development is facilitated by our Clinical Development
Team made up of dedicated specialists. Carrie Lee, MD, MPH serves as Medical Director of the CPO, Claire
Dees, MD, ScM, is the Faculty Director of the Clinical Development Team, and Matt Milowsky, MD, chairs the
Clinical Trials Executive Committee composed of the disease-specific Protocol Office Disease (POD) faculty
and other leaders. In 2019, interventional trials accrued 2799 patients including 733 accrued to treatment trials.
Observational studies enrolled 656 patients, and 514 enrolled on ancillary/correlative trials. LCCC clinical trials
enroll patients from the entire state of North Carolina, our catchment area.
A unique feature of LCCC’s CPDM is the Clinical Development Team that assists investigators developing IITs
in study concept development and design, funding applications, protocol writing, and adherence to regulatory
requirements including IND support and management of FDA communications. With this team over the past 5
years we have increased our IITs by 30% and nearly doubled our LCCC-held INDs to 42. Trial review is
facilitated by our PODs, endorsed trials undergo review by the Resource and Feasibility Team (RAFT) to
ensure appropriate staffing and resources, then review by the Protocol Review Committee (PRC).Budget and
contract development occur in parallel so that IRB review and contract execution can be as close as possible.
The LCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee meets monthly to review trials, with the frequency of review
based on risk and complexity as determined by the LCCC PRC. The CPDM supports independent audits of our
IITs conducted by an external entity, the UNC Office of Clinical Trials (OCT). The Compliance Committee
meets monthly to review audit findings and corrective and preventive action (CAPA) plans.
UNC LCCC conducts research on minority health disparities and seeks new ways to optimize trials across
underserved groups and the lifespan. Dr. Charlot, the CPDM faculty advisor for minority accrual, is activating
plans to improve clinical trial participation of racial/ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged
populations, creating a valuable link between CPDM and COE."
10771964,"Background: Veterans with > 2 chronic conditions (multimorbidity) comprise almost 50% of patients in the
Veterans Health Administration (VA). Primary care providers (PCPs) provide over 90% of outpatient VA care for
the most complex, high-risk Veterans with multimorbidity. At present, these patients and their PCPs must juggle
numerous healthcare and psychosocial needs with limited time and resources, both in clinic and in self-
management at home. Patients and PCPs also make decisions about what care needs to prioritize without
adequate guidance from clinical practice guidelines, many of which focus on single-disease processes. Patients
and PCPs often disagree about what is most important; patients prioritize symptoms, while PCPs emphasize
prognosis. Studies suggest that helping patients and PCPs communicate about what is most meaningful in life
to patients (i.e., “personal values”) and align preferred health outcomes (i.e., “health priorities”) streamlines care,
lowers treatment burden, and reduces unwanted interventions. To date, no study has clarified the circumstances
in which personal values can guide health decisions or developed an approach linking personal values and
actionable clinical care that helps navigate tensions between conflicting priorities. To address these gaps, this
CDA will integrate a patient’s personal values into high-quality primary care by developing and testing an
intervention (“Vet-Align”), a values-based approach to care for higher-risk Veterans with multimorbidity.
Significance/Impact: This CDA advances VA and HSR&D priorities by improving patient-centric primary care
and addressing what matters most to Veterans. This has long-term implications, including improving the
specificity and personalization of VA quality metrics, advancing universal health outcomes, promoting patient
engagement and adherence in care, and reducing waste and harm from unwanted or inappropriate care.
Innovation: This CDA develops and tests a novel intervention using patient values and priorities to align primary
care planning and delivery. This CDA will advance multimorbidity care and draws on novel methods including
human-centered design (HCD) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), a participatory decision process.
Specific Aims: 1) Understand how and when Veterans with multimorbidity connect values, health, and
healthcare, to clarify the life and health circumstances where patient values directly influence PCP-patient care
planning and self-management decisions; 2) Examine how VA ambulatory quality metrics align with and support
patient priorities and values, to develop guidance for aligning disease-oriented quality metrics with patient-
centered priorities of Veterans within a personal values-based care delivery model; 3) Refine and pilot test the
acceptability and feasibility of Vet-Align, a values-based intervention for Veterans with multimorbidity, including
tools and workflows for VA primary care to translate patient values into actionable clinical care plans.
Methodology: Patients with > 2 chronic diseases at higher risk for adverse events are eligible for Aims 1 and 3.
Aim 1 uses 25-30 semi-structured patient interviews, analyzed with content analysis. Aim 2 uses MCDA to
combine healthcare expert perspectives and clinical evidence to rank outpatient VA quality metrics according to
a patient’s preferred health priority. Building from findings and products from prior Aims, Aim 3a develops a
novel, PCP-facing action-planning tool and workflows using HCD. Aim 3b pilot tests the tool in a clinical
intervention (Vet-Align) for 30-36 patients and 15-20 PCPs. Vet-Align includes staff skills training and patient
sessions with health coaches to elicit patient values, set health priorities, and personalize the action planning
tool to send to PCPs. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed from patient and staff perspectives.
Next Steps/Implementation: The intervention developed in this CDA-2 will provide the foundation for a full
randomized clinical trial evaluating clinical effectiveness through change in patient-centered outcomes and care
quality, and testing implementation strategies for sustainment. Long term goals of this research trajectory are to
strengthen the patient-centeredness and quality of VA primary care for Veterans with multimorbidity."
10731065,"Background: Suicide is a major public health concern, particularly among Veterans with serious mental illness
(SMI, i.e., psychotic disorders or bipolar disorders). These Veterans have among the highest rates of suicidal
ideation and behavior among U.S. and Veteran populations. Yet, an SMI diagnosis is often an exclusion
criterion for suicide-focused clinical trials, and people with SMI are frequently disengaged from care, have
cognitive impairments, and have limited social supports. These factors may likely impact the feasibility and
usefulness of current suicide prevention interventions such as suicide safety planning – a VHA standard of
care. This proposal refines and pilots SUicide Prevention by Peers Offering Recovery Tactics (SUPPORT) –
the first suicide prevention intervention tailored to Veterans with SMI to improve participation in their lives and
society.
Significance/Innovation: Suicide prevention is a top clinical priority for VA/DoD and RR&D. This research is
innovative for several reasons: 1) SMI diagnoses have frequently been excluded from suicide prevention
research and this proposal seeks to tailor a novel suicide-focused intervention specifically to Veterans with
SMI; 2) this proposal is one of few studies that includes Veterans with SMI to enhance safety planning, which
is crucial given that it is an existing suicide prevention standard of care in VHA; 3) this proposal integrates the
recovery model and best practices into suicide prevention; 4) SUPPORT is delivered by Peer Specialists,
which the 2019 VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Assessment and Management of Patients at Risk
for Suicide highlighted a priority for future research to explore “post-acute care approaches,” such as safety
planning, and that such approaches could be peer-delivered; 5) this is the first intervention to integrate
cognitive learning strategies in a suicide-focused intervention to accommodate cognitive impairments in SMI.
Methodology: The proposed 5-year study aims to refine and pilot a peer-delivered intervention to improve
functional and social recovery to decrease suicide risk; the proposal consists of two phases. Phase 1 (1.5
years) employs a user-centered design approach to refine SUPPORT aided by scientific and consumer (n=8)
advisory board stakeholders as well as training our PSs to fidelity on pilot cases in an open trial (n=15) and
qualitative interviews. SUPPORT is a 4-week peer-delivered intervention intended to augment safety planning
by addressing functional and social goals personalized to each Veteran’s recovery following a suicidal crisis
while including cognitive learning strategies to enhance recall and salience of intervention material. Following
adaptations from Phase 1, Phase 2 (3.5 years) includes a pilot (n=50) randomized controlled trial (RCT) of
SUPPORT compared to an enhanced standard care (ESC) condition that contains the elements of standard
practice suicide prevention delivered at VHA, which include: 1) suicide risk assessment, 2) VA Safety Planning
Intervention, 3) timely referral to VA mental health outpatient care, and 4) Suicide Prevention Coordinator
follow-up contacts. Veteran participants in both phases will be quantitatively assessed at baseline, mid-
treatment, post-treatment, and 3-months post-treatment (and qualitatively interviewed at post-treatment; Peer
Specialists delivering the intervention will also be qualitatively interviewed post-treatment). The primary
outcomes to be evaluated is improvement in personal recovery and reduction in suicidal ideation severity.
Secondary outcomes concern changes in various domains of personal and social functioning.
Next Steps: This CDA-2 is the first step toward developing a program of research within VHA focused on
enhancing suicide related care by tailoring recovery-informed suicide-focused interventions to Veterans with
SMI. Pending confirmation of feasibly and preliminary impact, Dr. Chalker would submit for an RR&D Merit to
explore a multi-site, adequately powered RCT of SUPPORT versus ESC. We would emphasize 1) examination
of moderators or groups of interest (such as women Veterans) and 2) SUPPORT mechanisms of change."
10752659,"Proteoglycans (PGs) are ubiquitous on mammalian cell surfaces and in the extracellular
matrix. PGs are made up of heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains
covalently attached to the core protein through tetrasaccharide linkers. PGs play important roles
in many biological processes. However, due to the heterogeneity of naturally existing PGs, it is
extremely challenging to purify well-defined structures to study the structure and activity
relationship. Traditionally, the biological functions of PGs are believed to be dictated by the
glycosaminoglycan chains attached. Evidence is emerging that the core protein may significantly
impact the glycan activities. During the last grant period, homogeneous heparan sulfate and
chondroitin sulfate glycopeptides have been synthesized, providing access to these complex
molecules for the first time. However, the synthesis required total over 100 chemical steps to
complete a glycopeptide with a heparan sulfate chain, which limited the synthetic output.
Furthermore, with the current synthetic strategy, some of the common structural features in PGs
are not accessible. To overcome these challenges, in this renewal application, the power of the
biosynthetic enzymes will be harnessed to greatly expand the capability for PG synthesis. In aim
1, the key enzymes will be produced to generate the tetrasaccharide linkage region with the core
peptide, and to extend the glycan chain. Automated synthesis strategy will be developed to further
expedite the synthesis. In aim 2, ligation strategies will be established to synthesize glyco poly-
peptides with multiple glycan chains. This will provide a powerful tool to extend the poly-peptide
backbone, and to probe the hypothesis that the core protein can modulate glycan activities. In
aim 3, synthesis of a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan bikunin like glycoprotein will be completed.
Bikunin is an approved drug to treat the potentially life-threatening sepsis conditions, and its
mechanism is currently unclear. Aided by the structurally well-defined synthetic bikunin, the
molecular mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory activities of bikunin will be established,
demonstrating the power of synthesis in expanding the understanding of the interesting biological
properties of these complex molecules."
10762336,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The prevention and treatment of heart disease remain challenging. Rho kinase (also named ROCK)
has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic target for various cardiovascular diseases. A long-term goal of
our past twenty years of research on ROCK pathophysiology is to define the roles and underlying mechanisms
of ROCK-mediated signal pathway in regulating cardiac remodeling. The two members of the ROCK family,
ROCK1 and ROCK2, have both shared and distinct cellular functions and can compensate each other in
numerous single isoform knockout conditions. The majority of our knowledge on the cellular and molecular
function of ROCKs comes from research on proliferative cell types in which ROCKs modulate actin
cytoskeleton organization through promoting actomyocin contraction and F-actin stabilization. Cardiomyocytes
stand apart from other cell types because they contain both sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric cytoskeleton.
There is a gap in our knowledge on how ROCKs regulate sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric F-actin in
cardiomyocytes and how these processes contribute to overall heart function. Recently, for the first time to use
inducible approach to delete both ROCK isoforms in cardiomyocytes, we have discovered that although
ROCKs are not required for maintaining sarcomeric cytoskeleton in adult hearts, they do participate in the
regulation of non-sarcomeric F-actin organization, inhibit autophagy by promoting mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) activity and contribute to age-related cardiac fibrosis. In contrast, the non-sarcomeric F-
actin dynamics are able to be maintained with the presence of either isoform in the cardiomyocytes where the
other isoform has been deleted; this might be attributed to compensatory over-activation of the remaining
isoform in cardiomyocytes having single ROCK isoform deletion. The proposed research aims to further
elucidate the pathophysiological roles and downstream pathways of ROCK-mediated actin cytoskeleton
changes in cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts under pathological stress sceneries. Aim 1 will determine if deletion
of both ROCK1 and ROCK2 from adult cardiomyocytes limits the progression of heart failure in pathological
hypertrophy and myocardial ischemic injury through activating autophagy and facilitating autophagic flux by
inhibiting mTOR signaling. Aim 2 will determine if deletion of both ROCK1 and ROCK2 from adult fibroblasts
limits the activation of myofibroblasts and fibrotic response through inhibition of F-actin regulated transcription
factor activation including the serum response factor (SRF) and myocardin-related transcription factors
(MRTFs); the direct contribution of ROCKs/F-actin/MRTFs/SRF axis in fibroblasts to cardiac fibrosis has never
been demonstrated in vivo, and our preliminary results indicate that the inducible approach is required for
double ROCK knockout in fibroblasts. The biomedical significance of this work is to provide the cutting-edge
concepts for understanding pathophysiological roles of ROCKs in heart failure. The ultimate goal is to develop
new therapeutic intervention to ameliorate compromised cardiac function."
10838504,"Abstract
Chronic inflammation, referred to as ""inflammaging"", is a risk factor for many age-related chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes, cancer, frailty). Aberrant immune responses may be linked to inflammatory-mediated metabolic and functional disorders but many mechanistic gaps exist. Among recently appreciated regulators of inflammaging are microRNAs (miRNAs). One example of which is the anti-inflammatory miR-146a, where we and others have shown that mice deficient in this miRNA succumb to a life-shortening chronic inflammation that involves clinically relevant comorbidities (1-6). Moreover, deletion of miR-155 in T cells significantly extends the lifespan of miR- 146a·1· mice which points to a vital role for T cell expressed miR-155 in this context including CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (3, 5). We have recently expanded our analyses of this critical process by investigating novel pathways in aging T cells that are regulated by miR-155 during inflammaging. By conducting single cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) we have identified three gene programs that are counter-regulated by miR-146a and miR-155 in aged T cells that have not been previously examined in this context. These include aerobic glycolysis, chemokine production, and senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors. Additional preliminary data stemming from initial exploration of these pathways have pointed us to a novel, age-associated inflammatory cos+ T cell subset (Taa cells) that is GZMK""CD8"" and that expands in both mice and humans (7), and that is regulated by miR-155. Based on these preliminary data, we will carry out the following research aims in an effort to gain substantial new insights into T cell-dependent mechanisms that drive inflammaging and that are regulated by miRNAs. We will also uniquely extend these analyses to young and older adults in efforts to translate our findings to humans. 1) Determine the functional roles of miR-155-induced GZMK+CD8+ T cells during inflammaging. 2) Determine the molecular and metabolic mechanisms underlying miR-155 functions in T cells during inflammaging. 3) Determine if Taa and Tfh cells and their miR-155 levels in older adults correlate with markers of chronic, low-grade inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and muscle strength. We anticipate that this work will unveil key cellular and molecular mechanisms by which miRNAs play pivotal roles in regulating lifespan through their influence on T cell-mediated, age-dependent chronic inflammation. As a result, therapeutically actionable targets will emerge with the potential to limit age-associated human inflammatory diseases that continue to rapidly gain in prevalence in our society."
10755709,"CORE C PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this program project is to test the contribution of changes in high density lipoprotein (HDL)
function in human disease, specifically atherosclerosis. One of the major hypotheses tested is that the lipid
peroxidation that occurs during various condition that increase the risk for atherosclerosis (e.g. familial
hypercholesterolemia and chronic kidney disease) causes HDL to become modified by reactive lipid
dicarbonyls and that these modifications markedly alter HDL function. This core will provide synthetic versions
of these reactive dicarbonyls to project investigators so that they can test the effects of HDL modification. This
core will also provide synthetic compounds that act as dicarbonyl scavengers and that can be used in both
cultured cells, in animals, and in humans to block the reaction of dicarbonys with proteins and
phosphatidylethanolamine. These scavengers are useful both to test the contribution of these dicarbonyls and
as potential medicinal agents. Finally, this core will measure dicarbonyl adducts on proteins and
phosphatidylethanolamine.
Aim 1: Synthesize IsoLG and other dicarbonyls for testing in cultured cell and animal models.
Aim 2: Synthesize dicarbonyl scavengers for testing in cultured cell and animal models.
Aim 3: Measure the amounts of dicarbonyl modified proteins and phosphatidylethanolamines that are
formed in tissue samples and fluids in animal models and humans with disease."
10755713,"Summary
The purpose of this program is to significantly advance our understanding of mechanisms of HDL Dysfunction
in Projects (1) familial hypercholesterolemia (2) chronic kidney disease, (3) small RNAs, and (4) reactive
dicarbonyl modification to HDL. The proposed research strategies are highly cross-disciplinary and require
extensive next-generation RNA sequencing, data analysis, and data integration. An effective and dedicated non-
coding RNA and bioinformatics core is essential for the success of the proposed studies in each project and the
overall program. Specifically, the Non-Coding RNA and Bioinformatics Core is designed to handle the large
volume of sequencing needs and data analyses for all 4 projects. We are highly trained, skilled, and experienced
in generating sRNA-seq libraries, bulk total RNA-seq libraries, and 10X Chromium single cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) preparations for high-throughput sequencing. We are proficient in performing quality control steps
and completing the sequencing tasks. Furthermore, we have developed in-house sequencing analysis pipelines
that will be implemented by computational biologists and biostatisticians under the guidance of an existing
informatics team that has worked closely over the past 6 years. The purpose of the Non-Coding RNA and
Bioinformatics Core is to use high-throughput RNA sequencing and informatics to analyze small and long RNA
expression changes associated with HDL dysfunction and atherosclerosis treatments in a timely and efficiently
manner with high-quality data management and integration into complex bioinformatics systems."
10755716,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder, most commonly due to mutations in the
LDLR gene, characterized by severely elevated levels of LDL-C and increased risk of premature atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Although lowering LDL-C is the undisputed primary goal of therapy, there is
mounting evidence that HDL function is impaired in FH. A major hypothesis of this project is that dysfunctional
HDL contributes to the residual inflammatory risk of cardiovascular events in FH patients. Reactive dicarbonyls
including MDA, IsoLG, and ONE are highly reactive species that rapidly adduct to apoAI and HDL phospholipids
impairing HDL function. We have discovered that ApoAI and HDL are modified by MDA and IsoLG in FH and
that HDL function is dramatically impaired in terms of cholesterol efflux capacity, as well as anti-inflammatory
and antioxidant functions. Furthermore, we have recently discovered that two small molecule dicarbonyl
scavengers, 2-HOBA and PPM, improve HDL function, reduce LDL oxidation, and dramatically reduce
atherosclerosis in Ldlr-/- deficient mice, a model of FH, in the absence of significant changes in plasma lipid
levels. In addition, the lesions were characterized by a dramatic reduction in necrosis, which was associated with
increased macrophage survival and efferocytosis. The lesions had features of stable atherosclerotic plaques,
suggesting the hypothesis that dicarbonyl scavengers promote lesion remodeling, inflammatory resolution and
plaque stabilization. Therefore, in Specific Aim 1, we will examine the hypothesis that dicarbonyl scavengers are
capable of remodeling pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions in Ldlr-/- mice. We will examine the hypothesis that
improved HDL function promotes inflammatory resolution as characterized by increased macrophage
efferocytosis and increased Tregs, contributing to the antiatherogenic mechanisms of dicarbonyl scavengers. In
addition, we will test the hypothesis that the atheroprotective effects of dicarbonyl scavenging are in large part
due to preservation of HDL functions by performing atherosclerosis studies in HDL deficient Ldlr-/-ApoAI-/- vs.
Ldlr-/- mice. In Aim1c, we will examine the hypothesis that macrophage scavenger receptors, CD36 and SR-BI,
play critical roles in mediating the impact of reactive dicarbonyls on atherosclerosis. These mechanistic studies
of the impact of dicarbonyl scavengers on atherosclerosis will set the stage for a clinical translational study in
humans. Recent Phase I studies with 2-HOBA have demonstrated its safety in humans. Therefore, in Specific
Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that 2-HOBA will reduce modification of HDL and improve HDL function in
humans with heterozygous FH and in subjects with coronary artery disease without FH. The impact of 2-HOBA
on HDL small RNAs will be examined. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that α-Me-2-HOBA will have improved
pharmacokinetic attributes and better ability to reduce atherosclerosis in Ldlr-/- mice compared to 2-HOBA, as a
first step toward developing α-Me-2-HOBA as a second-generation scavenger that has an improved
pharmacokinetic profile with the goal of improving HDL function and reducing ASCVD in humans."
10755723,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been linked to intestinal dysbiosis and chronic kidney disease,
(CKD) disrupts the intestinal epithelial integrity and disturbs carbohydrate and protein metabolism
that stimulate intestinal toxins. These toxins perpetuate the adverse effects through interorgan
crosstalk known as the kidney-gut-cardiovascular axis that involves blood vessels and nerves.
Our proposal challenges current research and clinical paradigms. We propose a new mediator
and pathway in the kidney-gut-cardiovascular axis. The pathogenic mediator in the axis is
intestinally-originating IsoLG-modified HDL. We hypothesize HDL, which is intestinally
synthesized or filtered from the circulation, becomes modified by intestinally-generated IsoLG.
The new pathway in the axis is the mesenteric lymphatic network that serves as a target and
perpetrator for IsoLG-HDL effects by increasing propulsive mobility in these vessels and activating
lymphatic endothelial cells. Together, the IsoLG-modified HDL and lymphatic vessels provide a
sustained influx of intestinally-derived accelerants promoting vascular dysfunction and the
development of atherosclerosis via the kidney-gut-cardiovascular axis. To test this hypothesis,
we propose three mechanistic aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that CKD-induced
intestinal modification of HDL is a key pathogenic mechanism in the kidney-gut-cardiovascular
axis. First, we will define the impact of kidney disease and uremic toxins on intestinal IsoLG
production and modification of HDL. Next, we will use intestinal versus liver-specific knockouts of
apoAI, the main structure-function protein of HDL, and ascertain how CKD impacts the
contribution of intestinal- and plasma-derived HDL to the mesenteric lymph HDL pool. We will
then determine the specific IsoLG modifications of apoAI in the CKD setting. We will also define
the impact of CKD and IsoLG-modification on HDL-miRNA transport in plasma and mesenteric
lymph. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that IsoLG-modified HDL disrupts the structure and
function of intestinal lymphatics in CKD. First, we will determine the impact of IsoLG-modified
HDL on LEC phenotypic changes, vessel integrity, contractility, and lymphangiogenesis in CKD.
We will then determine the role of HDL-miRNA in the interactions between HDL and the lymphatic
network. We will first identify miRNA carried by lymphatic HDL in CKD. Then, we will determine
the mesenteric lymphatic vascular network in humans with CKD and assess the link between
CKD-HDL and dysfunction of lymphatic vessels and lymphatic endothelial cells. In Aim 3, we will
test the hypothesis that CKD-driven acceleration in atherosclerosis can be reduced by IsoLG
scavengers that lessen intestinal IsoLG-adducted lipoproteins and lymphatic dysfunction."
10755729,"Summary: Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause for ischemic cardiovascular disease (CVD), a pathology best
characterized as uncontrolled inflammation in response to continual lipid deposition in the arterial wall. Despite
the importance of inflammation in the progression of atherosclerosis, very few therapies are designed to target
this process due to a general lack of knowledge of atherogenic stimuli outside of bioactive lipids. Previously, we
have reported that lipoproteins, namely HDL and LDL, transport small non-coding RNAs (sRNA), and recently,
we discovered that lipoproteins are highly-enriched with sRNAs derived from bacterial and fungal species in the
microbiome and environment. Interestingly, these foreign, microbial sRNAs (msRNAs) are also highly-abundant
in macrophages within the atherosclerotic lesions and activate sRNA-sensing toll-like receptors (TLR)7/8 in
lesion macrophages. We posit that HDL accepts msRNAs from lesion macrophages, and thus, suppresses
TLR7/8 activation and down-stream pro-inflammatory gene expression. Supporting this model, macrophages
were found to readily export msRNAs to HDL and HDL treatments were found to block msRNA-induced
activation. In CVD, HDL acquire reactive dicarbonyl modifications which are associated with HDL dysfunction.
In preliminary studies, we found that reactive dicarbonyl modifications on HDL, e.g. isolevuglandins (IsoLG),
impair HDL-msRNA export. Moreover, we found that IsoLG-modified HDL had increased macrophage uptake
and retention and induced pro-inflammatory gene expression. Preliminary studies also found that treating mouse
models with reactive scavengers to block IsoLG modifications decreased atherosclerosis. Therefore, we aimed
to block msRNA activation of TLR7/8 using non-targeting locked-nucleic acids (ntLNA). Strikingly, we found that
ntLNA treatments significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesion area by 30% over 4 weeks in Apoe-/- mice on
western diet. In addition, single-cell RNA sequencing approaches demonstrated that ntLNA therapy repressed
pro-inflammatory gene expression in lesion macrophages and reduced the number of pro-inflammatory
macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions. Based on preliminary studies, we hypothesize HDL removes msRNA
from lesion macrophages through retro-endocytosis, a process that is inhibited by IsoLG modifications on HDL.
Furthermore, we posit that msRNA activation of endo-lysosome TLR7/8 in lesion macrophages can be readily
targeted with ntLNAs to reduce atherosclerosis. To test this hypothesis, we aim to I.) Determine the
mechanism(s) and consequences of macrophage msRNA export to HDL, the impact of HDL-msRNA export on
macrophage activation, and define the HDL-mediated reverse sRNA transport (RsRT) pathway in vivo, II.) Define
the impact of dicarbonyl modifications and msRNA cargo on HDL dysfunction in CVD, and III.) Target
macrophage msRNA receptors to inhibit atherosclerosis progression and promote regression. This project will
open entirely new fields of study for lipoproteins, extracellular sRNAs, host/non-host interactions, and
inflammation, which have applicability to many other diseases, but is particularly critical for CVD."
10755734,"A major factor in mortality from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the formation and expansion of
necrotic cores within lesions, which arise when macrophages that normally carry out efferocytosis
(phagocytosis of apoptotic cells) fail to clear apoptotic cells and instead undergo secondary necrosis. This
project seeks to elucidate the contribution of two families of lipids, isolevuglandins (IsoLG) and N-
acylethanolamides (NAEs), that potentially interact through HDL to altered macrophage efferocytic function, as
well as the role of Nape-pld, an enzyme that catalyzes both the formation of NAEs and the degradation of the
IsoLG adducts. We hypothesize that under normal conditions HDL promotes the ability of macrophages to
carry out efferocytosis by 1) accepting the cholesterol that macrophages take up during phagocytosis of
apoptotic cells and 2) delivering NAE precursors to macrophages which use their Nape-pld to hydrolyze these
precursors to NAEs which can promote expression of genes needed for efferocytosis. We hypothesize that in
conditions that promote atherosclerosis, HDL becomes modified by IsoLG which retards efferocytosis by 1)
inhibiting HDL's ability to accept cholesterol and 2) creating ligands recognized by pattern recognition
receptors that drive macrophages to a pro-inflammatory phenotype with high expression of inflammatory
cytokines and low expression of proteins needed for efferocytosis. Thus, IsoLG modification of HDL and
reduced Nape-pld expression combine to suppress the efferocytic capacity of macrophages, leading to the
formation and expansion of necrotic cores which create vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques.
We will test this hypothesis as follows:
Aim 1 will determine if apoAI lysine residues critical to cholesterol efflux are modified by isolevuglandins during
development of atherosclerosis.
Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanisms whereby HDL modified by lipid dicarbonyls potentiate inflammation in
macrophages and determine if these alterations contribute to reduced efferocytosis.
Aim 3 will determine the effects of macrophage Nape-pld deletion on atherosclerosis and macrophage
efferocytic capacity."
10756120,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are a cancer of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) on the rise in the aging
population and cancer survivors. The only curative treatment for MDS is allogeneic stem cell transplantation
with marked limitations in the majority of MDS patients. As a result, standard-of-care focuses on
hypomethylating agents (HMA) azacytidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC), which invariably result in resistance
and disease progression. There is a dire need for new therapeutics; however, there are no robust models of
MDS to accelerate preclinical testing. We have generated a breakthrough humanized xenograft-recipient
mouse model which eliminates conditioning and facilitates engraftment of primary MDS. We will validate the
model by single-cell genetic and genomic characterization of diagnostic MDS patient material before therapy
and of the same cells engrafted in humanized mice, clearly dellineating the transcriptional impact of
xenografting. Next, we will establish pharmacodynamic endpoints for AZA within the mouse model and apply
the empirically-derived dose of AZA to the model. Human MDS material will be captured for single cell
analyses post-AZA therapy from both patients and xenografts. The multi-omics comparative analyses will
incisively determine the utility of MISTRG-W41 for MDS preclinical testing, by illustrating the extent to which
AZA-affected programs in patients are similarly changed in the xenograft. This deep molecular, genotypic, and
phenotypic understanding of HMA effects on subclonal and hierarchical cellular compositions of MDS will build
the basis for comparison of novel-targeted-therapeutic agents as alternatives, concurrent, or post-HMA
therapeutic approaches."
10754866,"Project Summary
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has made unprecedented strides in discovering previously
unrecognized diversity of neuronal cell types and their functions. Using scRNAseq, we showed that the mouse
geniculate ganglion contains 3 molecularly distinct types of gustatory neurons that innervate taste buds, T1,
T2, and T3, each with unique patterns of gene expression. In a concerted effort from two well-established
laboratories, we now propose a multi-PI project to test hypotheses regarding distinct functions for each of the
major types of neurons and their subtypes. Our ultimate goal is to produce an integrated molecular and
functional categorization of gustatory neurons similar to what has been so powerfully effective in the auditory,
visual, and somatosensory systems. We propose using a newly-optimized method for in vivo confocal Ca2+
imaging, neuron-selective fluorescent markers, and chemogenetic silencing to reveal the functions of T1 and
T3 geniculate ganglion neurons. Specifically, using GCaMP-based Ca2+ imaging, we will test the hypothesis
that within the cluster of T1 neurons there are subclasses that respond to distinct taste qualities whereas
neurons within the T3 cluster respond to multiple, convergent tastes. We will further test the hypothesis that
T1 and T3 neuronal subtypes contribute to separate central pathways serving a number of taste-dependent
functions downstream of initial detection in the taste periphery.
Completing the above aims will move the field of taste into a new era of molecular-functional integration. Our
findings will assist electrophysiology and circuit tracing studies in taste, will shed light on the controversy over
labeled lines versus combinatorial taste coding, and will bring new information on gustatory neural pathways
that are so important to nutrition and ingestive behavior."

There are no effective treatments to replace damaged retinal neurons, reflecting a fundamental inability for
humans to mount robust regenerative responses within the central nervous system. To address this, it will be
critical to understand the diversity of gene regulatory mechanisms that can impede or drive neuron regeneration
across vertebrate contexts. Embryonic amniotes have a transitory ability to regenerate retinal neurons from cells
of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) if supplied with exogenous FGF2 at the time of retinal injury. This
mechanism of regeneration can be readily induced at embryonic day 4 (E4) of chicken development, but RPE
neural competence is lost by embryonic day 5 (E5). The overarching objective of the proposed research is to
profile changes in gene regulation that dispossess RPE cells of their neural competency as they differentiate.
Specific aim 1 will interrogate transcription factor regulatory activity within RPE cells across the E4 / E5
developmental window by integrating gene expression analysis, chromatin accessibility profiling, and
transcription factor binding assays. Preliminary bulk and single nuclei RNA-seq datasets revealed the acute
activation of neural retina transcription factor profiles at both E4 and E5, such as PAX6, ASCL1, and VSX2. In
contrast, genes associated with RPE maturity, such as OTX2 and pigmentation genes, were elevated in the E5
RPE independently of retinectomy and FGF2 treatment. Similarly, chromatin accessibility suggested wider
dysregulation of OTX2 and related homeobox transcription factor binding sites. During the 1-year F99 phase,
OTX2 binding activity will be profiled in intact and FGF2-treated RPE cells at E4 and E5 stages. Additionally,
single nuclei RNA-sequencing will capture the heterogeneous transcriptional states of RPE cells during
differentiation and FGF2 treatment response at E4 and E5. These results will be integrated to into a model that
describes how changes in the RPE gene regulatory landscape culminates in a loss of neural competency. In
specific aim 2, the gene regulatory networks present in adult vertebrate models of central nervous system
regeneration will be interrogated to inspire novel routes for the induction of mammalian regeneration. This K00
phase will focus on the development of key research skills, including multi-omics data analysis approaches,
techniques for spatial transcriptomics and single cell epigenomics, and cross-species genomics /
transcriptomics. Up to 4 years will be spent on the K00 phase in an environment directly supportive of these
applications. Specific professional development objectives will be concurrently pursued, such as pedagogical
development, diversity outreach initiatives, and grant writing. Together, these aims encompass a career
development plan that will lead to formation of an independent research program and result in impactful research
focused on expanding human central nervous system regenerative capacity."
10848181,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background: The use of central nervous system (CNS) stimulants such as amphetamine, dextroamphetamine,
methylphenidate, armodafinil and modafinil is discouraged in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) as they
have no proven benefits and carries the FDA black-box warning of a higher risk for developing substance use
disorders (SUD).
Significance: TBI is a major source of morbidity and mortality for Veterans, and a top HA/ORD/HSR&D priority.
Our preliminary data suggest that as of May 2021, nationwide 728,065 Veterans had a diagnosis of TBI in their
EHR. The TBI registry estimates that 81% of the Veterans have mild TBI. Veterans with TBI are more likely to
receive CNS stimulants than those without TBI. Our preliminary data suggests that 5.8% (42,437/728,065) of
the Veterans with TBI received prescriptions for CNS stimulants, which is over 10 times higher than that in
Veterans without TBI (0.56%). Findings of our preliminary study also suggest that compared to non-users of
CNS stimulants, users have a higher risk of SUD. Currently, there is no evidence-based therapy for treatment of
mild TBI and the VA mild TBI guidelines discourages the use of medications to ameliorate neurocognitive
symptoms. However, many Veterans with TBI receive prescriptions for CNS stimulants but less is known about
the safety of these drugs in Veterans with TBI.
Innovation & Impact: To the best of our knowledge, the study questions have never been answered before.
The key innovation of the proposed study is in the filling of the scientific knowledge gap, the potential clinical
implications of the findings, and the relevance to the Veteran population. Our methodological innovation will
include the use of deep machine learning approaches including the impact and the interaction scores developed
by our team to quantify the results of deep learning.
Specific Aims: 1) To characterize stimulant prescription pattern in Veterans with mild TBI; 2) To test the
hypothesis that initiation of stimulant therapy is associated with a higher risk of incident SUD, hospitalization,
and mortality in Veterans with mild TBI; and 3) To develop an explainable machine (deep) learning risk prediction
model that will allow a more accurate and precise assessment of clinical benefits vs. risk of stimulants in
individual Veterans.
Methodology: These aims will be achieved by using the VA TBI registry and EHR data. For Aims 1 and 3, we
will use all Veterans with a TBI diagnosis and any use of stimulants. For Aim 2, we will emulate the design of an
RCT, using Veterans with TBI free of prevalent SUD and new prescriptions of CNS stimulants after mild TBI
diagnosis. We will then conduct sensitivity analysis in the subset of Veterans with mild TBI using the
Comprehensive TBI Evaluation (CTBIE) tables. Propensity score matching will be used for outcome-blinded
assembly of cohorts balanced on measured covariates, and sensitivity analyses will be used to estimate impact
of unmeasured confounders. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data will be used to validate the
generalizability of our prediction model.
Next Steps/Implementation: In additions to the traditional dissemination approaches through presentations and
publications, we will share our software tools with the VA AI center for dissemination and work with our
operational partners to incorporate the findings of the proposed project into clinician education materials."
10770360,"Project Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and the most common form of dementia worldwide.
Despite decades of research, there are few therapies that can delay or prevent AD progression. Retrograde
trafficking through retromer-dependent cargo recognition has emerged as a critical cellular process that is
mutated or disrupted in patients with AD and other forms of dementia. Conditional knockout of retromer genes
in neurons leads to increased secretion of Tau and Amyloid β (Aβ), hallmark protein pathologies linked to AD.
This milieu of neuronal-secreted factors leads to inflammation in microglia and astrocytes, two glial cell types
thought to influence the progression of neurodegeneration. In this proposal, I aim to study the cascade of events
linking neuronal retromer disruption to glial inflammation, characterizing the specific cell state changes involved,
and identify the key factors that mediate this effect. I will address this aim using genetically engineered stem cell-
derived models of human neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. Microglia also express retromer components and
upregulate these factors in AD, yet there are few studies of retromer function specifically in microglia. In Aim 2 I
will therefore explore the effects of retromer-related mutations specifically on microglia in the context of early
aging in mice, a comparable time point to when dementia manifests in patients with these mutations. I will
additionally utilize stem cell models to dissect the functional and signaling changes that are induced in microglia
with retromer disruption. Finally, although there have been several studies looking at the effects of retromer on
specific receptors, little is known about the systems-level effects of retromer mutations on protein trafficking to
the endosomes. To identify retromer-dependent signaling pathways that may be pathogenic, I have developed
novel proteomics tools to quantify endosomal proteome changes and will use these tools to compare the effects
of different retromer mutations on neuronal and microglial endosomes. The ultimate goal is to understand how
retromer disruption affects brain cell states and leads to pathogenic signaling changes."
10693244,"Worldwide, traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to more death and disability than other trauma-related
injuries. Recent statistics indicate that 69 million people are affected by this “silent epidemic,” with 4.6 million
affected persons residing in the United States and Canada. Military personnel are especially vulnerable to TBI,
considered a signature injury of recent wars. These closed-head, shockwave-induced blast TBIs (bTBI), caused
by proximity to explosive devices, lead to neuropsychiatric impairment that significantly affects the quality of
life after injury. Neuroinflammation is linked to neuropsychiatric illness in the general population and thus,
may mediate these impairments. There is a critical need for effective anti-inflammatory treatments for blast
TBI, an area of active investigation. Extensive research shows that select neuromodulatory and
pharmacotherapy tools can be used to activate the cholinergic inflammatory reflex to modulate
neuroinflammation, but it is unknown whether either approach can be used after bTBI. The current application
will address these gaps in knowledge by determining the utility of vagus nerve stimulation, a neuromodulation
tool, and anatabine, a full-cholinergic agonist, using a rodent model of bTBI. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS),
an FDA-approved neuromodulation treatment for select neuropsychiatric disorders, is currently being explored
for various inflammatory conditions and neurorehabilitation. Anatabine is similarly being examined for
neurorehabilitation, but neither treatment has been used for blast-related, closed-head injuries. The current
study aims to address this knowledge gap by completing the following short-term goals in a pre-clinical
(mouse) model of bTBI: 1) understand whether the cholinergic pathway can be targeted to alter the
inflammatory response to bTBI, and 2) understand whether targeting this pathway can reduce
neuropsychiatric deficits that substantially affect the quality of life after injury. These goals will be achieved by
completing three specific aims: 1) Characterize the neuroinflammatory response to bTBI as it relates to the
neuropsychiatric consequences of injury, 2) Determine the effectiveness of VNS to alter the immune response
to improve neuropsychiatric consequences of bTBI, and 3) Determine the effectiveness of a cholinergic agonist
to alter the immune response to improve neuropsychiatric consequences of bTBI. Our preliminary data and
recent VISN1CDA support our hypotheses and the feasibility of carrying out the proposed research. The current
project is designed to extend our proof-of-principle work to clearly define the utility of these novel treatments.
If successful, this promising neuromodulation treatment could advance the standard of care for military
personnel and improve the quality of life for Veterans and their families. The current Career Development
Award-2 will be performed at the White River Junction VA Medical Center and incorporates existing
infrastructure and equipment, including a blast tube apparatus, unique equipment that recapitulates battlefield
injuries. The candidate has scientific experience with pre-clinical models evaluating dysfunction in the
autonomic nervous system and immune system. She has over ten years of research experience, including
animal models of disease and neurotrauma, microsurgery, neuromodulation, immunohistochemistry,
histology, and microscopy. Dr. Noller has assembled a mentoring team consisting of leading VA scientists and
physicians with extensive experience mentoring early career investigators towards independence. The scientific
team also includes local experts for consultation on specific aspects of the work. The immediate research
activities will support Dr. Noller’s long-term career goal of becoming a translational VA scientist. Specifically,
the CDA-2 will provide protected time while she receives mentored training in neuroinflammation,
neuroanatomy, quantitative neuropathology, and neurobehavioral assessment of rodents. Collectively
completing the research activities and mentored and specialized training will establish her expertise in the field
and culminate in full research independence as a VA Research Scientist."

High affinity antibody titers elicited by infection or vaccination form the basis for protection against reinfection.
However, preexisting antigen-specific titers are also associated with diminished secondary B cell responses to
the same antigen. This concept, termed antibody mediated feedback, remains poorly defined at the
mechanistic level. Elucidation of the mechanisms and outcomes of antibody feedback on B cell clonal selection
is required to develop immunization strategies that target conserved epitopes on repeatedly encountered
evolving pathogens.
To study antibody mediated feedback in a physiologic setting, I propose to develop an oligoclonal B cell
adoptive transfer mouse model with only three specificities to different epitopes on influenza hemagglutinin
(HA). In my preliminary work, I have characterized three monoclonal antibodies that bind to distinct sites on
HA. In parallel, I have genetically engineered the ability to delete plasma cells. Combining these two models
will allow for the removal of immunoglobulin of one specificity from a system with a simplified B cell repertoire.
Observing the outcomes of B cell clonal selection upon removal of specific antibodies will provide insight into
the precise mechanism by which antibody mediated feedback operates.
I am an MD/PhD student at the Weill Cornell/Memorial Sloan Kettering/Rockefeller Tri-Institutional Program,
performing the proposed research in the laboratory of Dr. Gabriel Victora at The Rockefeller University. My
long-term goal is to become a physician scientist who balances patient care with running an independent
research program at an academic institution. The plan outlined in this proposal, along with the support and
mentorship provided by Dr. Victora, Dr. Nussenzweig, my thesis research committee, and the Tri-Institutional
administrative faculty will help me achieve my career goals."
10744220,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pain has a major impact on the quality of life, remains difficult to alleviate, and has contributed to the over-
prescription of opioid analgesics that is often linked to the recent epidemic of addiction and mortality.
Clinical pain results from inappropriate signaling from the somatosensory system, caused by changes in
activity of peripheral sensory neurons and/or central processing of this input.
Molar teeth are richly innervated by specialized somatosensory neurons, yet we only notice tooth sensation
when injury or inflammation trigger intense toothache. This transformation of innocuous dental sensation
to exquisite pain underlies the most common form of orofacial pain. Here I will address the roles,
responses, and molecular mechanisms of sensory neurons innervating teeth in health and inflammation in
order to expose both tooth-specific and common pain mechanisms, and spur new ideas for development
and testing of non-opioid analgesics to alleviate pain.
The overall objective of this application is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible
for tooth sensation (mentored phase) and address how sensory input from the teeth may be transformed
to drive pain (independent phase). Powerful, cutting-edge approaches will be leveraged to develop a new
and comprehensive view of the physiological roles of tooth-innervating trigeminal sensory neurons. To
achieve this goal, Dr. Joshua Emrick will work with a mentoring team including Dr. Nicholas Ryba (primary
mentor), Dr. Mark Hoon (co-mentor), and Drs. Alexander Chesler and Jennifer L. Gibbs (collaborators). In
Aim 1, Dr. Emrick will explore the function of the tooth-innervating neurons by studying their central
connectivity and manipulating them with optogenetics. To this end, standard nocifensive assays as well as
orofacial feature categorization using machine learning will be used to evaluate pain responses. In Aim 2,
Dr. Emrick will determine how trigeminal neurons respond to stimulation of teeth using an in vivo calcium
imaging platform.
In combination, these studies will reveal new information about tooth sensation, provide a tractable model
for understanding pain, and a strategy for developing targeted clinical pain therapies. Importantly, the
proposed training will support Dr. Emrick’s career development in his transition into independence as a
dentist-scientist."
10728336,"Project Summary/Abstract
A gap exists in our understanding of the pathophysiology behind Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), which has led to
virtually nonexistent treatment options. Recent studies have identified microglia, the innate immune cells of the
brain, as key players in the response to AD that may help us fill this gap. Specifically, microglia appear to play
a protective role against toxicity associated with amyloid-ß containing plaques. Through activation of the
triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) signaling pathway, microglia migrate towards and
surround these plaques while inducing a distinct transcriptional signature known as the Disease Associated
Microglia (DAM) phenotype. An important outstanding question is how microglia regulate this state, both
transcriptionally and functionally. Our lab has previously identified the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)
as an important epigenetic regulator of brain region specific microglia subpopulations. PRC2 is an epigenetic
complex involved in gene silencing and has also been implicated as a signaling regulator in immune cells.
Notably, we found that PRC2 deficient microglia downregulate many genes in the TREM2 signaling pathway. I
hypothesize that PRC2 controls the microglial response to amyloid-ß containing plaques in a TREM2-
dependent mechanism. In support of this, I generated a PRC2-deficient microglia mouse line crossed to the
5xFAD amyloid model of AD and showed that PRC2-deficiency leads to loss of plaque associated microglia,
similar to TREM2-deficient models. This could be due to transcriptional regulation of the TREM2 pathway or
direct modulation of TREM2 signaling. To further investigate my hypothesis, I will first characterize the
epigenetic and transcriptional role PRC2 plays in 5xFAD microglia. There are multiple TREM2-dependent
mechanisms that could lead to decreased plaque associated microglia – inability to sense plaques, increased
death at the plaques, or lack of migration towards the plaques. To determine if PRC2 regulates these
phenotypes in a TREM2-dependent manner, I will culture primary mouse microglia and pharmacologically
inhibit PRC2, followed by induction of TREM2 signaling. With this model, I will assay TREM2-dependent
sensing, survival, and migration. The results of this proposal will reveal whether PRC2 is a master regulator of
the microglial response to AD amyloid-ß containing plaques through its control of TREM2 signaling, either
transcriptionally or through direct regulation of the signaling pathway. These data are critical to furthering our
understanding of how microglial functional states are regulated, opening avenues for the development of
effective treatments against Alzheimer’s Disease."
10747964,"Sepsis accounts for nearly 50% of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit and significantly impacts
mortality. However, therapy for sepsis-associated AKI (SA-AKI) has remained elusive because the
pathophysiology of injury is not well understood. Evidence emphasizes the pathogenic role of systemic cytokine
storm and proximal tubular damage (oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction) in SA-AKI. The cytokine
response, mediated by NFkB and HIF-1α signaling in myeloid cells (particularly, macrophages) is a dominant
pathogenic mechanism in sepsis. In this context, treatment of macrophages with ferritin light chain (FtL) reduces
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of NFkB and HIF-1α and subsequent pro-inflammatory gene
expression (IL-6, TNFα). Additionally, administration of FtL to wildtype mice mitigates cecal ligation and puncture
(CLP) induced hyperinflammation. Single cell RNA sequencing on renal cell populations from mice administered
FtL (or saline) and then subjected to LPS endotoxemia identified cystatin A (CSTA) as the most significantly
upregulated gene in the myeloid populations of FtL administered mice. CSTA is an intracellular inhibitor of
cathepsins. While the role of CSTA in sepsis is unknown, cathepsins augment the inflammatory response via
activation of NFκB. Therefore, we propose that FtL prevents the hyperinflammatory response via CSTA-
mediated inhibition of cathepsin and NFκB/HIF-1α signaling during sepsis. Pertinent to the kidney, while CLP
led to marked expression of kidney injury markers (NGAL and KIM-1), FtL administration prevented such
induction and preserved expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1- alpha
(PGC-1α), a regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism. Proximal tubules (PT) are the sites of
maximal injury during sepsis and FtL is expressed in this tubular segment. Thus, we propose to determine the
disparate roles of macrophage- and PT-derived FtL in the protective response during sepsis. Our findings are
clinically relevant because serum ferritin levels (predominantly FtL) are often elevated during inflammation but
its role in inflammation is unknown. We propose that an increase in FtL is an adaptive physiological response to
control inflammation and promote survival. In Aim 1, using two models of sepsis (CLP and LPS) combined with
novel tools to delete or overexpress FtL, we will determine whether FtL induces CSTA expression and inhibits
macrophage HIF-1α signaling, thereby preventing mitochondrial dysfunction, glycolysis and subsequently
mitigating overproduction of cytokines. In Aim 2, we will determine the distinct functional roles of macrophage
vs. PT-specific FtL expression in mitigating loss of kidney function, renal inflammation, oxidative stress and
mitochondrial dysfunction. Using an integrative approach of in vitro and in vivo models, we will determine the
function of FtL during sepsis. If our hypothesis is validated, the results will justify the development of a new
treatment for SA-AKI that could alleviate the significant burden of sepsis induced morbidity, mortality and
substantial health care expenditures."
10542357,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Early diagnosis of lung cancer is critical to patient survival. Unfortunately the vast majority of cases are
detected once symptoms arise and the cancer has spread offering patients little hope for cure (average 5-year
survival rate < 15%). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends individuals at high risk of
developing lung cancer undergo yearly screening with low dose computed tomography (LDCT). Screening is
highly sensitive at detecting lung nodules and has resulted in a reduction in mortality of these patients,
however only 5% of nodules detected are likely to be cancer. Diagnosis of lung cancer must be made on the
microscopic level which is traditionally done by obtaining tissue specimens for subsequent histopathology
examination. Methods for biopsy generally fall under two categories; high-risk surgical and transthoracic
procedures that provide a higher diagnostic yield, and low-risk bronchoscopy based procedures that generally
have a lower yield. Given that the vast majority of nodules detected by LDCT screening are benign it is critical
that the high-risk procedures for diagnosis are avoided. The low diagnostic yields of bronchoscopy based
biopsy procedures can be attributed to insufficiently large, inappropriately located, or non-diagnostic tissue
sampling. Therefore there is a critical need to dramatically increase the diagnostic yield of low-risk bronchial
biopsy approaches. In our laboratory we have developed novel optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging
approaches to provide high-resolution images of tissue microstructure. We have additionally developed and
disseminated OCT interpretation criteria for the diagnosis lung cancer. In this proposal we aim to further
develop our endobronchial OCT imaging catheters to provide images with superior resolution and contrast with
the goal of microscopically guiding biopsy site selection to increase tumor yield (Aim 2), and to use our
endomicroscopy images and previously developed image interpretation criteria to provide a preliminary
diagnosis of the lesion within the procedure room (Aim 3). The intra-procedural diagnostic endomicroscopy
images could be useful complementary information provided to pathologists in addition to the tiny physical
biopsy specimens for diagnosis, or to enable immediate diagnosis and treatment of small lesions without
requiring a second procedure."
10756972,"We have identified TCF21 as the coronary artery disease (CAD) associated gene mapped by genome-wide
association studies at 6q23.2. By combining conditional deletion of Tcf21, smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineage
tracing, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), and anatomical cellular lesion analysis in the ApoE null
model, we have shown that it is upregulated in SMC to promote de-differentiation, proliferation, and migration
of medial SMC into the plaque where they contribute to the protective fibrous cap. This work profiled at a single
cell level the transition of SMC to a fibroblast like phenotype, creating cells that we term “fibromyocytes”
(FMC). Genomic studies conducted as part of this funded work have suggested that TCF21 binds and
regulates expression of a number of cooperating transcription factors (TFs) in other CAD loci to govern the
SMC-FMC transition. Further, TCF21 targeted TFs in other CAD loci modulate an SMC transition to a
chondrocyte-like phenotype, which is characterized by gene expression patterns typical of endochondral bone
formation, producing cells we term “chondromyocytes” (CMC). These findings point to two interrelated complex
gene networks that regulate SMC cell state transition as a mechanism of disease causality. Our hypothesis for
this renewal application thus proposes that: disease risk associated with SMC phenotypic transition is
mediated by TCF21 and related transcription factors that regulate interactive transcriptional networks
constituted in large part by CAD associated genes. The primary goal of work proposed here is to further
characterize these networks and define the epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms of TF interactions that
determine the CAD risk engendered by the SMC phenotypic response to vascular stress. Specifically, in Aim 1
we will conduct single cell ATAC sequencing (scATACseq) with wildtype and Tcf21 null atherosclerotic mice,
as well as human coronary artery tissues, to map enhancers genome-wide that are differentially regulated in
SMC phenotypic transitions, and identify TFs that bind these enhancers. In Aim 2 we will perform scATACseq
and scRNAseq following CRISPR/Cas9 perturbation of identified transition TFs in a human coronary artery
smooth muscle cell de-differentiation model to examine the impact of TF knockdown on transcriptional profiles
and interactions of TFs linked to the FMC and CMC phenotypes. To investigate the relationship of SMC
phenotype to CAD risk, we will determine how perturbation of SMC transition TFs alters accessibility at
promoter regions and linked enhancer regions at CAD associated loci. In Aim 3 we will examine with molecular
methods the mechanisms of epistasis and functional interactions between the TFs that primarily define the
SMC transition phenotypes and identify transcriptional links to CAD. This work will thus characterize
fundamental processes by which SMC TFs activate phenotypic transitions through epigenetic and
transcriptional mechanisms, extending our understanding of this disease and promoting opportunities for
ameliorating human CAD risk."
10760315,"Project Summary
Nuclear migration and anchorage are central to many cellular events. We uncovered a conserved network of
nuclear envelope proteins and force generators that mediate nuclear positioning. LINC (linker of nucleoskele-
ton and cytoskeleton) complexes, which we discovered, maintain nuclear envelope architecture, mark the
surface of nuclei distinctly from the contiguous ER, and were instrumental in the early evolution of eukaryotes.
We address four gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms regulating nuclear positioning. (1) How is the
developmental switch between nuclear migration and anchorage mediated? We hypothesize that different
LINC complexes are required for a nucleus to switch from migrating to being anchored. We propose that an
intermolecular disulfide bond, which could be regulated by protein disulfide isomerases and/or the AAA+
ATPase torsin, is central to the switch. We further hypothesize that LINC directly interacts with the outer
nuclear membrane to optimize the transfer of forces across the nuclear envelope. (2) How are nuclei anchored
in large syncytial cells? It is important for nuclei to be evenly spaced so that multi-nucleated syncytia are able
to act as a single unit. We recently found that ANC-1 anchors syncytial nuclei and mitochondria through
unknown, LINC-independent mechanisms, and hypothesize that ANC-1 organizes the cytoplasm through
microtubules. (3) How do nuclei favor one microtubule motor over another at different stages of development?
The KASH protein UNC-83 mediates nuclear movements toward plus or minus ends of microtubules at differ-
ent stages of development. We hypothesize that the choice is regulated by alternative isoforms of UNC-83 that
differentially activate kinesin-1 motor activity. (4) How do nuclei deform to migrate through narrow spaces? Our
data support a model where LINC complexes function parallel to branched actin networks to deform nuclei as
they squeeze through narrow constrictions. Our experimental system is innovative because we can view live
nuclei throughout development, including a tissue where 139 nuclei are in a single hypodermal syncytium and
a second tissue where nuclei migrate through narrow constrictions as a normal part of development. Further-
more, we have developed reagents essential to our future plans, including an array of point mutants in LINC
complexes that separate function, cell-specific markers, a tissue-specific auxin-induced degron system, and
over ten mutant lines from a forward genetic screen for defects in nuclear migration through constrictions. To
complement our C. elegans genetic approaches, we also collaborate to confirm our findings in mammalian
tissue culture cells and an in vitro microtubule motor assay with TIRF microscopy. Our studies are expected to
determine how LINC complexes are regulated at molecular and biophysical levels, how the outer nuclear
membrane is involved in force transmission, how giant KASH proteins organize the global cytoskeleton and
position organelles, how UNC-83 mediates the choice between dynein and kinesin-directed nuclear move-
ments throughout development, and how actin helps nuclei squeeze through constricted spaces."

10995397,"PPROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
mRNA in cells contains base modifications, strategically (and dynamically) placed at specific position in
the RNA. For fundamental research, RNA containing site-specific modifications can be generated by
chemical synthesis, but only at very short lengths. The proposed research aims to build on recent
advances in co-immobilized flow transcription to develop an enzymatic system to incorporate (multiple
and different) modified bases site-specifically. Such a system would enable more detailed studies of
translation and alternative splicing, for example, where base modifications are known to play key roles.
Synthesis of RNA with position-specific substitutions will also facilitate studies of RNA structure and
dynamics, where fluorescent probes for FRET/environment studies or stable isotopes for NMR
measurements are essential. A better understanding of the roles of specific base modifications will
ultimately inform future RNA therapeutics."
11177203,"ABSTRACT FOR THE CENTRAL LABORATORY CORE
The California-Mexico-Puerto Rico (CAMPO) Consortium will perform three clinical research studies 
focused on the prevention of cervical cancer among HIV-positive women in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Study 1
will examine new screening algorithms for cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) in 4000 
HIV-positive women in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Study 2 will evaluate the impact of anogenital probiotic use on 
anal and cervical microbiota profiles and the relationship to anal and cervical HSIL regression in 600 HIV-positive women and men as well as reduction of high-risk HPV DNA persistence among those with no lesions. 
Study 3 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a multivalent replication-defective adenovirus-based 
therapeutic HPV vaccine to treat cervical and anal HSIL in 300 HIV-positive women and men and identify 
immune response correlates of HSIL regression. Working with the Data Management and Statistics Core, the 
Administrative and Coordinating Core, and the Clinical Trials Program, the Central Laboratory Core (CLC) will 
perform laboratory assays for each of the three studies. The aims of the CLC are: (1) To perform laboratory 
assays required to achieve the primary aims of the clinical research studies conducted within the CAMPO 
Consortium’s Clinical Trials Program; (2) To perform laboratory assays for correlative science studies for the 
CAMPO Consortium; (3) To expand research capacity of consortium partners in Mexico and Puerto Rico 
through technology transfer; (4) To participate in rigorous quality control programs to ensure the validity of 
laboratory data; and (5) To support training and career development of early career investigators in laboratory-based research. The CLC will be led by Dr. Alejandro Garcia-Carranca of INCan and co-led by Drs. Filipa 
Godoy-Vitorino of UPR and Joel Palefsky of UCSF. Similar to the other CAMPO Cores, the CLC will be 
comprised of a network of investigators and facilities across the three Consortium sites, working closely 
together but with each site tasked with a role based on their specific expertise. The CLC will have both virtual 
and physical components, with CLC laboratory facilities at INCan, INSP and the Condesa Clinic in Mexico, the 
University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center, the University of Puerto Rico Clinical Trials Center, 
and UCSF. The network will use GlobalTraceTM to track and ship laboratory specimens between the sites. The 
CLC will form working groups centered on CAMPO’s scientific agenda- HPV diagnostics, microbiome research 
and cellular immunology- with representation from scientists at each site and will participate on CAMPO 
Clinical Trials Program study protocol teams. The CLC will perform a rigorous quality assurance program and 
report results on a regular basis to CAMPO leadership."
11183112,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CLINICAL TRIALS PROGRAM 
The goal of the Clinical Trials Program is to address the dual burden of HIV infection and HPV-associated 
cervical cancer in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Over 270,000 women die every year of cervical 
cancer, and it disproportionately affects women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where 
approximately 90% of cervical cancer deaths occur. Peru and the Dominican Republic experience a 3-fold 
higher incidence of cervical cancer than the US, as well as high rates of HIV infection, especially in vulnerable 
key populations. Women and children living with HIV (WLWH and CLWH) are more likely to have persistent 
HPV and high-grade lesions, and they are at higher risk of progression to cancer than HIV-uninfected women. 
Addressing the needs of HIV-infected persons at risk for HPV-associated cancers in LMICs involves improving 
access to HPV vaccines and more effective screening for and treatment of cervical high-grade lesions. Instead 
of replicating the infrastructure needed for screening used in high-resource settings, the clinical trials proposed 
here seek to use a new combination of prevention and treatment methods aimed at point-of-care with low-infrastructure support. We will leverage and strengthen existing research capacity in Seattle and the LAC sites 
to explore sustainable solutions that are acceptable to local providers and patients. This includes investigating 
optimal HPV vaccine schedules for HIV+ children, assessing new HPV tests and visual imaging technologies 
to help clinicians to perform high-quality screening and triage, and testing non-surgical approaches to improve 
outcomes of cervical cancer precursors among WLWH. Toward this goal we will conduct three clinical trials: 
Trial 1: HPV immunoprevention by vaccination of unexposed children is not optimized for children living with 
HIV (CLWH). We will compare longer-term immune (anamnestic) responses among HIV-infected youth (ages 
9-13 at the time of enrollment) after 1, 2, or 3 doses of 9-valent HPV vaccine. 
Trial 2: Cervical cancer screening and triage among WLWH needs to be optimized to improve detection of 
precancerous lesions, reduce overtreatment and facilitate implementation. We will develop a more efficient 
algorithm to detect high-grade lesions (CIN2/3) by assessing standard of care (Pap test and visual inspection 
with acetic acid), HPV testing, and newer technologies including HPV E6/E7 expression and enhanced visual 
inspection (EVA) with automated visual evaluation (AVE), comparable to colposcopy. 
Trial 3: Evaluating non-surgical strategies for treatment of high-grade lesions (CIN2/3) diagnosed in 
WLWH from Trial 2 in a 2x2 factorial trial of 9-valent HPV vaccine and sirolimus initiated before surgery. 
These trials will be framed by the Cervical Cancer Prevention Partnership (C2P2) Center, that brings 
together collaborators in Peru, the Dominican Republic, Seattle, with international external scientific and 
community advisors. The teams have extensive experience conducting high-quality clinical trials and working 
to prevent HPV-related cancers in LMICs and improve health and quality of life for persons living with HIV."
11183114,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CENTRAL LABORATORY CORE
The Central Laboratory Core (CLC) will be based in Seattle within the laboratory of Dr. Denise 
Galloway (co-chair of Trial 1) and include the robust services of our Shared Resources Facilities at the Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch). While Dr. Galloway is best known for her work on the role 
high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) play in anogenital cancers, her lab is broadly focused on the role that 
small DNA viruses play in cancer. To aid in epidemiologic studies, the Galloway lab has developed serologic 
assays to detect and characterize papillomavirus-specific antibodies. These latter assays will be conducted in 
the CLC for trials 1 and 3 (see below). 
The CLC will oversee and efficiently manage and coordinate acquisition and shipping of protocol-specified biological specimens (with relevant clinical data) to appropriate laboratories for testing and to the 
central tumor/specimen repository for storage of specimens for future correlative laboratory studies. Dr. Joseph 
(Jody) Carter will lead the Core, and manage the CLC in Seattle, and will be available to advise the LAC 
partner institutions, if required, on management of sample storage, testing, and shipping of protocol-specific 
specimens and storage of samples for current trial endpoints and for future studies. The Core will work with 
each trial team to develop standard-operating protocols (SOPs) for each protocol. Dr. Carter has over 25 years 
of experience as a laboratory leader and will help each of the trials develop consistent approaches to quality 
control for each of the laboratory assays.
Laboratory and pathology oversite provided in the Laboratory Core will be effectively matrixed with 
effort provided by Fred Hutch personnel named within the trials. For example, the extensive work on HPVspecific memory B cell responses conducted by Dr. Galloway’s lab is included in Trial 1 but shares personnel 
and objectives with the CLC. Placement of the CLC at the Fred Hutch will also allow access to Fred Hutch 
Shared Resources, for example, the Immunopathology Lab directed by Dr. Robert Pierce. Dr. Pierce is a 
Board-certified Anatomic Pathologist with a strong academic and industry background in immuno-oncology. 
His laboratory research is focused on mechanisms of tumor-induced immune tolerance by which tumors can 
escape anti-tumor immune responses, including natural and therapy-induced responses. He is expert in using 
multiparametric immunohistochemistry (IHC) panels to quantitatively analyze the phenotype and tissue 
distribution of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, and in the development of biomarkers to 
predict responses to immuno-oncology treatments. Although the details of Trials 2 and 3 (delayed onset trials) 
will be finalized only after the grant is awarded, we anticipate the Dr. Pierce will participate in training and 
quality assurance for pathology for trials 2 and 3, and for the correlative studies proposed for trial 3."
11179774,"This interagency collaborative project will provide support to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), CDC for implementation of nationally representative hearing health examinations and interview epidemiological survey questions for assessment of hearing thresholds and risk factors for hearing loss and related conditions such as hyperacusis and tinnitus in both children and adults. 

A special emphasis of the NHANES 2025-2026 epidemiological hearing examination and questionnaire component will be collection of data to assist in studies of hearing loss induced by noise, other ototraumatic, or ototoxic agents. In addition to exposure to noise from personal audio devices, many individuals are exposed to potentially hazardous levels of sound from noisy activities, such as concerts, music venues including bars or dance clubs, sporting events, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, mass transit systems, fireworks, and hunting or target shooting.  An estimated 22 million U.S. workers are exposed each year to potentially hazardous noise on the job.  As many as 26 million U.S. adults have developed a hearing loss as the result of their noise exposure—hearing losses that are nearly all preventable.  This NHANES study also includes blood laboratory assays that will allow research investigators to examine chemical exposure to lead, solvents, and carbon monoxide (e.g., cigarette smoking) effects that cause damage to the ear.  These data will also be available as a comparison dataset in future studies of hearing loss, and as a baseline to monitor progress in prevention.

The current protocol for the hearing examination component was developed by NCHS in collaboration with the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). 

The target group for the audiometry exam are Survey Participants (SPs) 12–44 years old. The component includes four parts:
1) Questionnaire items. Hearing-related questions are included in the household questionnaire and in the Mobile Examination Center (MEC) pre-exam questionnaire. Questionnaire items collect information on self-reported hearing ability; use of hearing aids and hearing protective devices; relevant medical history; noise exposure history; and conditions that could affect the results of audiometric testing.
2) Otoscopy. A cursory physical examination is conducted of the outer ear. A photo of the SP’s eardrum in each ear is captured with a digital otoscope and sent to NIOSH for interpretation.
3) Tympanometry. An objective evaluation of middle ear function is conducted based on the movement of the eardrum as pressure is varied in the ear canal. 
4) Pure tone air conduction audiometry (Hearing Test). A basic evaluation of hearing sensitivity is performed. Hearing thresholds are obtained at seven frequencies (500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 6,000, and 8,000 Hz) bilaterally, with a repeat threshold at 1,000 Hz in each ear to verify response consistency. The test is conducted automatically by an audiometer in a quiet space using boothless audiometry.  Background noise in the test area is monitored continuously during pure tone audiometry testing. The measured noise levels are linked to each threshold. Thresholds that may have been contaminated by excessive background noise will be flagged in the dataset."
11181924,"This interagency collaborative project will provide support to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), CDC for implementation of nationally representative epidemiological health interview survey questions inquiring about communication disorders of voice, swallowing, speech, and language in both childhood and adults. This survey obtains information about communication disabilities, including voice, swallowing, speech, and language disabilities, and asks about the impact on a person’s life and health, ability to work or go to school, interact socially and engage during health care encounters. Adults with communication disabilities are at risk for decreased quality of life, health status, and health care services received. Targeted interventions delivered in a community or medical setting, including speech-language pathology services and occupational support, can potentially mitigate these risks. Few current epidemiological studies have explored the prevalence of communication disorders and associated factors in the United States.
While voice, swallowing, speech, and language disorders are distinct disabilities with different biological mechanisms, they can all cause a person to have difficulty communicating and thus are collectively referred to as communication disorders. Multiple national epidemiological surveys, including the American Community Survey (ACS), the Current Population Survey – Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC), and the Decennial Census of Population and Housing, collect information on the prevalence of disability in the United States, but these surveys do not specifically identify or distinguish between voice, swallowing, speech, and language disorders."

11195264,"Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in the United States where it is the most common non-cutaneous cancer among men. The landscape of PCa diagnosis and risk assessment is evolving due to a growing awareness of the limitations and potential harms associated with prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening. While early-stage PCa is highly treatable, overreliance on PSA screening
has led to issues like false positives, unnecessary biopsies, and the overdiagnosis of non-life-threatening PCa. This underscores the pressing need for more precise and reliable risk assessment tools that can improve early detection while minimizing the adverse consequences of screening. Recent research emphasizes the vital role of the human microbiome in cancer initiation and progression. In this context, Oncobiomix has introduced an innovative microbiome signature score that has the potential to shift the paradigm for PCa risk assessment. This score evaluates the presence and abundance of specific gut microbiota associated with PCa, offering a novel tool compared to traditional PSA testing. This proposal will facilitate development of a stringent CLIA/CAP standard operating procedure for proprietary microbiome signature, thus providing a novel PCa risk assessment approach. Ongoing human testing from this study will expedite clinical
validation and commercialization."

11193012,"OVERVIEW SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with more than 1.6 million deaths/year globally. It is
often diagnosed at an advanced stage and is associated with poor outcomes for the majority of patients. This
application for a lung cancer SPORE award from Emory University brings together an outstanding and multi-
team of oncologists, immunologists, drug discovery experts, and translational researchers dedicated to lung
cancer research to address critical questions that will improve the outcome for patients with this lethal disease.
Our proposed program will have significant impact in two crucial areas of lung cancer management: enhancing
the efficacy of immunotherapy and overcoming treatment resistance through the development of novel
molecularly targeted agents. Through strong teamwork carried out by this highly collaborative team of dedicated
investigators, and building on exciting data published in leading journals by our group since our previous SPORE
application, this revised submission aims to achieve substantial improvements in the management of patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), through three overall Specific Aims: Aim 1: To evaluate stem-like T
cells and improve efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC (Project 1); Aim 2: To target MERTK to
improve outcomes for EGFR-mutated NSCLC (Project 2); and Aim 3: To target Bax signaling to overcome
treatment resistance in NSCLC (Project 3). The Emory Lung Cancer SPORE program will be supported by
close interaction with the Administrative Core (Core 1), Pathology Core (Core 2) and the Biostatistics and
Biomedical Informatics Core (Core 3), and will conduct Career Enhancement and Developmental Research
Programs (CEP and DRP). The SPORE program will benefit from regular advice and recommendations from
External and Internal Advisory Board members regarding its progress and direction. Our program will receive
strong institutional support including modern research space, excellent shared resources, and a significant level
of matching funds (totaling $2.25M) from the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (an NCI-designated
Comprehensive Cancer Center), Emory University Woodruff Health Sciences Center, Emory Healthcare System,
Emory School of Medicine, and the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology. Through team-driven
innovative research efforts in immunotherapies and molecularly targeted therapeutics, we are confident that this
SPORE program, in collaboration with other lung cancer SPORE sites, will have a major positive impact on the
management of lung cancer."

HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study
NIH is supporting research to better understand brain development, beginning in the perinatal period, and extending through early childhood, including variability in development and how it contributes to cognitive, behavioral, social, and emotional function. Knowledge of a wide range of brain trajectories is critical to understanding how they may be affected by exposure to opioids and other substances (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, cannabis), stressors, trauma, and other significant environmental influences, including those that promote resilience.
The HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study will recruit a large cohort of pregnant individuals and follow them and their children through early childhood. The study will collect information beginning at birth and continuing through early childhood, including structural and functional brain imaging; anthropometrics; medical history; family history; biospecimens; and social, emotional, and cognitive development.
Knowledge gained from this research will be used to better understand prenatal and postnatal exposure to environmental conditions and help identify resilience factors that may mitigate adverse outcomes.

11196837,"The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women and for men. The Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN) was established to provide qualified sites the ability to perform clinical trials of new products, including a Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center (SCCC). 
Progestogenic androgens are a class of drugs that can bind both the androgen and progesterone receptors with varying affinities. By promoting low circulating levels of gonadotropins via hypothalamic and pituitary arrest, the normal mechanisms for ovarian follicular maturation and release and sperm production are impaired. NICHD has sponsored studies evaluating progestogenic androgens in phase I and IIa clinical studies in healthy cis male volunteers, which established its androgen action, favorable safety profile and acceptability. Consequently, given its contraceptive potential, potent androgenicity, and lack of significant safety concerns, progestogenic androgens may be an ideal candidate for use in diverse populations as well. Examples of agents in development within the Contraceptive Development Program (CDP) include dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU), levonorgestrel butanoate (LB), 11- beta-methyl-19-nortestosterone dodecylcarbonate (11-beta-MNTDC), and other entities in preclinical development for use as a novel contraceptive product. 
The purpose of this Task Order is to conduct work required and to provide the appropriate deliverables associated with the completion of ongoing and new early and late phase clinical trials designed to investigate progestogenic androgens for contraception. This task order will support the coordination, monitoring, data analysis, and all other associated activities of ongoing and new clinical trials in the evaluation of progestogenic androgens as contraceptive agents in different populations. 
All sites will transfer data to the SCCC. After study completion, the SCCC will collect the data and perform data analysis and prepare a clinical study report suitable to support regulatory guidelines pursuant to eventual FDA approval of the new drug. The proposed task order will provide coordination of protocol approval, clinical trial conduce, oversight and monitoring, data analysis and a final clinical study report for the supporting regulatory approval of the product for contraception."

10998194,"According to the NIMH, approximately one in five Americans suffered from an anxiety disorder in the last year
and nearly 1/3 will experience an anxiety disorder in their lifetime. Anxiety disorders are primarily treated with
biogenic amine reuptake inhibitors which can have delayed or inadequate efficacy, so there is a great need for
additional anxiolytics with different mechanisms of action. There is clear evidence that activation of CB1R
cannabinoid receptors can be anxiolytic; however, direct activation of CB1Rs, with THC for example, can
produce undesirable effects, such as changes in cognition and posture, and can result in dependence. On the
other hand, CB1R indirect agonists, which elevate concentrations of the endogenous ligands of CB1R
(endocannabinoids, eCBs), represent a rational approach with beneficial effects of CB1R enhancement and
fewer off-target effects. Our team has discovered that sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2), which is enriched in the
amygdala, binds the eCBs N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) at nanomolar
concentrations and enhances intracellular sequestration of AEA. Thus, we hypothesize that inhibition of SCP-2
will reduce eCB sequestration, enhance CB1R signaling and thereby reduce anxiety. In support of this
hypothesis, SCP-2-1- mice exhibit reduced anxiety-like behaviors and enhanced extinction of conditioned fear,
both reversible by CB1R blockade. SCPl-1, a previously identified small molecule inhibitor of SCP-2, has
anxiolytic effects that are blocked by CB1R antagonism. However, SCPl-1 is not sufficiently potent, selective,
or metabolically stable to serve as a molecular probe of SCP-2 for further mechanistic studies. The goal of the
studies in this proposal is to design, synthesize and test a focused library of molecules to identify a potent inhibitor
of SCP-2 binding pocket that can be used in mechanistic studies to elucidate the role of this protein in the life
cycle of the eCBs, particularly in brain circuits involved in fear and anxiety. In Aim 1, we will utilize computer
assisted drug design (CADD) to develop FragMaps and use this information to design and synthesize new
potential SCP-2 inhibitors. CADD will also be used to predict metabolic issues and off-target effects of these
compounds. In Aim 2, we will use in vitro approaches to characterize SCP-2 binding of the novel inhibitors;
determine key physicochemical properties; and measure effects on cellular eCB uptake. Information from these
studies will be used to refine our computational model. In Aim 3, we will use in vivo approaches to determine
pharmacokinetic properties of a few novel molecules to inform us about dosing for behavioral assays, which we
will complete in this aim as well. We will determine potential toxicity and metabolism of these compounds.
Successful completion of these studies is expected to result in new small-molecule inhibitors of SCP-2 that will
be used to further validate the role of SCP-2 within the eCB signaling system, including its regulation of anxiety
and fear-driven behaviors. Innovation lies in testing the novel hypothesis that SCP-2 is a potential target for
developing safe and effective anxiolytics that work through indirect agonism of CB1R.
Project Summary/Abstract"
11166869,"Endometriosis is a chronic, debilitating condition that is associated with symptoms including chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, and infertility, as well as an increased risk for ovarian cancer, depression, migraines, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and other pain and autoimmune conditions. Despite the severe impact of endometriosis on quality of life, diagnosis may be delayed up to 10 years due to a normalization of intense menstrual pain by patients and healthcare providers, and the requirement for surgical visualization. This delay in prolonged patient suffering, increased risk for the development of comorbidities, and greater socioeconomic cost. Current medical and surgical treatments, which carry substantial risks and side effects, are associated with a high rate of recurrence and are best considered temporizing rather than curative. Non-invasive diagnostics and new treatments have been slow to develop, in part due to the need for better understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder. 
Diagnosis  of endometriosis currently requires laparoscopic surgery followed by histological confirmation as the gold standard; it is driven by diagnostic biases that exist in the absence of a non-invasive diagnostic that can detect all forms and stages of endometriosis. For example, the most common form of endometriosis, superficial peritoneal endometriosis (accounting for ~80% of cases), is often only diagnosed as an incidental surgical finding or in women with the most severe symptoms who are willing and able to risk surgery to receive a diagnosis. Even among those women who receive a referral (in itself a process wrought with disparities where sex, race, and socioeconomic status can affect the perception of female pain), laparoscopic surgery is invasive, requires recovery time, and presents access barriers (e.g., geographic location of endometriosis specialists, economic costs, insurance coverage) for many patients. It also does not correlate with severity of symptoms and provides limited predictive value prognosis or progression of disease. These limitations mean that only the most life-affecting symptomatology is funneled to diagnostic surgery; cases with symptomatology that is masked as other conditions, normalized by patients and providers, or related to lesser-known comorbidities of endometriosis are missed. 
Transvaginal  ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to diagnose ovarian endometriomas and deep infiltrating endometriosis subtypes only in certain anatomic locations and at certain stages of disease; these techniques are not yet reliably sensitive and accurate enough for definitive diagnosis. Additionally, diagnostic accuracy via laparoscopic and imaging techniques is limited in providers and technicians without specialized training. Diagnostic biomarkers to date have proven non-specific or unreliable and are not advised for use by professional society diagnostic guideline, despite tests claiming accuracy. 
These  barriers to diagnosis have lasting impacts on treatment and further research. Because a diagnosis is invasive and/or unreliable, clinicians may choose to treat without one. The suspicion of endometriosis may be treated with hormonal therapies or analgesics, with no attention paid to potential differences in endometriosis staging, subtype, size, location, or confounding comorbidities. Further, the diagnostic delay combined with biases of diagnosing only cases with the most severe symptoms means that even research trials must rely on cases heavily skewed towards advanced disease in white, socioeconomically advantaged populations for whom barriers to expert clinicians and specialty imaging modalities are lower. Women with African or Asian ancestry are underrepresented in diagnoses. Despite the known association with cancers, infertility, body-wide pain conditions, and autoimmune conditions, endometriosis that presents without debilitating pain is also underdiagnosed. 
Increased research and  development are urgently required to deliver non-invasive diagnostics, improved treatments, and, ultimately, prevention and cure for endometriosis.
The  overall goal of the RADx Tech ACT ENDO Challenge is to accelerate the development of non-invasive diagnostic technologies that can shorten the time to diagnosis, eliminate the invasiveness of current techniques, and/or improve accessibility, safety, convenience, and costs of diagnosis. While the development of novel diagnostic modalities is encouraged in this Challenge, the application or improvement of existing advanced imaging or other techniques that can reliably, reproducibly, and sensitively help non-invasively diagnose endometriosis is also welcome.  Innovators should also consider how their prototype technologies will help address disparities in the diagnosis of endometriosis among underrepresented and underserved populations. Diagnostics developed under this challenge can be directed specifically to symptomatic populations or as a screening modality for symptomatic and asymptomatic women.

11187468,"Emerging data have linked the gut microbiome to colorectal adenomas, the established early lesions in colorectal cancer (CRC) and de facto targets during screening colonoscopy. However, deficit in our knowledge of the basic science of the gut microbiome and the specific driver mechanisms for inducing adenoma formation and progression has impeded translation. We hypothesize that the microbiome is an adenoma nonautonomous inducer of colorectal “priming,” the term we use in this application to refer to molecular/cellular alterations critical for adenoma formation and progression. The near-term objective of this proposal is to define whether and how the microbiome and the primed colon act in concert to drive adenoma formation. The long-term objective of this proposal is to develop microbiome-based strategies for precision prevention of adenomas and ultimately CRC."
11199085,"Head and neck cancers (HNCs) account for nearly 3% of all cancers in the U.S. and most
commonly affect aging individuals. While chemo-radiotherapy is the standard treatment
approach for HNC, the method is known to cause substantial side-effects. In particular,
anatomical changes occurring during the treatment may result in under-coverage of the clinical
target volume or over-dosage of organs at risk.
The project will develop novel optimization models for Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) – a
customized treatment planning approach for individual patients designed by evaluating the
systematic and random variations in tumor response. The models will use imaging data of tumor
volume and normal tissue complication probabilities to determine the optimal number and timing
of treatment replans. The models will provide personalized optimization through sequential
decision-making based on response to treatment, as well as optimization and evaluation of
simple threshold replanning policies often used by doctors. Optimal behavior in the face of
conflicting payer/provider perspectives for emerging technologies will also be analyzed using
mechanism design techniques. ART requires information about patient-state as well as transition
probabilities describing the tumor's evolution over time. Since the process inherently calls for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, the proposed optimization models use a Markov
Decision Process (MDP). The resulting optimal policies may be difficult to implement in practice,
especially in centers lacking state-of-the-art equipment. Therefore, the proposed work will further
evaluate simple threshold replanning policies using a bilevel programming framework. In
particular, the bilevel program will find threshold values for various patient classes by minimizing
the deviation from the MDP-prescribed policy.
The proposed framework offers multiple avenues for methodological contributions. The novel
MDP design framework is an incredibly powerful tool that can be used to model many
interesting questions. We will explore ways of discretizing the continuous state spaces and
estimating transition probabilities based on patient imaging data. We will explore algorithms for
solving bilevel programs, especially utilizing the structure and properties of the lower-level MDP
models. Finally, we will study applications of the principal-agent framework from economics in
modeling payer/provider interactions for emerging clinical therapies.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
This study uses novel models to develop and validate an integrated approach to reduce cancer
radiotherapy side effects while maintaining or improving cancer control. It will maximize efficiency for
patients and providers. Its findings will inform decisions about individual radiation planning, optimize risk-
stratified treatment, and healthcare policy implementation of effective new technology interventions."
11187481,"Emerging data have linked the gut microbiome to colorectal adenomas, the established early lesions in colorectal cancer (CRC) and de facto targets during screening colonoscopy. Identification of intervenable hostmicrobiome interactions driving adenoma formation could serve as the basis for biology-backed precision prevention of adenomas and ultimately CRC. The Alaska Native community faces a high burden of CRC, with the highest incidence and mortality rates in the US. The reasons behind this disparity are unclear but may involve geographic challenges to accessing screening colonoscopy and CRC risk imparted by the microbiome. However, data on gut microbiomes in Alaska Natives are scant, and there are no published studies that have reported using metagenomic and/or metabolomic data generated specifically from the Alaska Native population to predict adenomas or CRC. In this Administrative Supplement to Support Cancer Disparity Collaborative Research, we address this through a proposed partnership between our lab at Fred Hutch Cancer Center and Dr. Diana Redwood’s group at Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC). We will identify gut microbial biomarkers for precancerous colorectal lesions in the Alaska Native population and establish the basis for improved non-invasive screening and investigations into microbiome-based adenoma-preventing interventions."

11177202,"ABSTRACT FOR THE DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL CORE
The California-Mexico-Puerto Rico (CAMPO) Consortium will perform three clinical research studies 
focused on the prevention of cervical cancer among HIV-positive women in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Study 1
will examine new screening algorithms for cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) in 4000 
HIV-positive women in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Study 2 will evaluate the impact of anogenital probiotic use on 
anal and cervical microbiota profiles and the relationship to anal and cervical HSIL regression in 600 HIV-positive women and men as well as reduction of high-risk HPV DNA persistence among those with no lesions. 
Study 3 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a multivalent replication-defective adenovirus-based 
therapeutic HPV vaccine to treat cervical and anal HSIL in 300 HIV-positive women and men and identify 
immune response correlates of HSIL regression. Working with the Administrative and Coordinating Core, the 
Central Laboratory Core and the Clinical Trials Program, the Data Management and Statistical Core (DMSC) 
has the following aims: (1) to support the Clinical Trials Program with rigorous methodology in study design, 
data analysis and dissemination of research findings; (2) to provide data management, data collection and 
quality assurance systems to efficiently meet the needs of the Clinical Trials Program and the Cores; and (3) to

11194038,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Structural racism, defined as the ways in which societies foster discrimination through mutually
reinforcing inequitable systems, has emerged as an important social risk factor and contributor to poor health
outcomes for racial/ethnic minorities (Egede 2020, Bailey 2017). Structural racism captures upstream historic
racist events (such as slavery, black code laws, Jim Crow laws, and school segregation) and more recent state
sanctioned racist laws in the form of redlining. Redlining refers to the practice of systematically denying various
services to residents of specific neighborhoods/communities, often based on race/ethnicity (Bailey 2020).
 A first important link between historic redlining and health outcomes is likely related to health care
access in the form of accessible hospital and neighborhood clinics, as well as the quality of these facilities. A
second important linkage between historic redlining and health outcomes is likely associated with the way in
which structural racism (in the form of redlining) has systematically deprived neighborhoods of economic
opportunities, and as such, of the ability to build individual and community assets in the form of housing value,
employment, and educational opportunities for its residents. These linkages between structural racism, access,
community assets, and health disparities, are furthermore of significant current policy relevance as recent
trends indicate a growing number of hospital and clinic closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Ellison 2021).
 However, the link between historic redlining and urban hospital and clinic closures as well as
community assets and community health outcomes are poorly understood. The goal of this project is to inform
our understanding of the pathways between structural racism (defined as historic redlining), urban hospital and
clinic closures, community assets, and health outcomes; and to further inform policies that can help reduce the
impact of structural racism on health disparities caused by hospital and clinic closures. The present study
seeks to accomplish this objective by using recently developed causal and interpretable machine learning
methods, along with econometric counterfactual analysis, to address the following aims: 1) Examine the
relationship between regional exposure to structural racism and the propensity of hospital and clinic closures.
2) Examine the relationship between hospital and clinic closures and community employment, income, and
education, as well as community health outcomes. 3) Predict risk of closure among urban hospitals and clinics
that are disproportionately serving racial/ethnic minorities from neighborhoods with exposure to structural
racism. 4) Undertake stakeholder engagement to address prevention of future closures and/or examine ways
to decrease the potential adverse community impact of hospital and clinic closures. The study is innovative in
its examination of the linkages between structural racism and health outcomes; its emphasis on identifying
policy channels for reducing the perpetual impact of structural racism; and its methodological use of a broad
set of mixed methods to achieve these aims."

10989418,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Exercise represents one of the most powerful and beneficial interventions for health and wellness, though patients with and without chronic disease struggle to exercise enough to garner its benefits. One sought after approach to overcoming these challenges is to provide the benefits of exercise pharmacologically, a so-called ""exercise-in-a-pill"" solution. This involves identifying biomolecular mechanisms responsible for exercise benefits and engaging them pharmacologically using small molecule agents. To accelerate discovery of exercise mimetic drugs, this project synergizes existing data from two National Institutes of Health Common Fund projects. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) provides a map of the biomolecular response to exercise, while the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINGS) Program provides a map of the biomolecular response to small molecule exposure. The investigators hypothesize that biomolecular exercise pathways and small molecule drug candidates from these two resources can be matched by their shared biomolecular ""signatures"". The maps are linked by matching exercise-induced changes in biomolecular expression (i.e., a gene expression ""signature"" of exercise) from MoTrPAC to similar expression changes induced by small molecules found in LINGS. By linking these two data sets, the project will create a detailed, browsable, and interactive resource for identifying potential exercise mimetics. Aim 1 seeks to identify biomolecular signatures of exercise training from MoTrPAC by analyzing publicly released multi-omic response data from MoTrPAC's exercise training studies in young adult rats. Specific objectives include: 1) identifying biomolecular ""signatures"" through gene set enrichment analysis, network clustering, and gene regulatory networks; 2) evaluating the validity and reliability of these signatures across tissues, sexes, and timepoints in the rat study; and 3) generating an annotated database of signatures for alignment with LINGS. Aim 2 integrates MoTrPAC and LINGS biomolecular signatures in a cloud-based infrastructure that matches MoTrPAC signatures with those available from LINGS. This infrastructure will be designed to 1) organize, browse, and fiter the MoTrPAC signatures database; 2) query existing cloud-based applications developed by LINGS for engagement with their library of data; and 3) deliver these results in a visually informative and interactive web application to maximize the user's ability to gain novel insights. Future efforts will expand the infrastructure by adding new MoTrPAC data and annotating exercise signatures with knowledge from other Common Fund datasets. Additionally, the project aims to leverage results to identify and prioritize pathways related to insulin resistance and other diseases for experimentation in model systems. This comprehensive approach seeks to accelerate the identification of exercise mimetics and provide valuable resources to translational researchers and stakeholders in the pharmaceutical pipeline."

11196342,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
Periodontal disease remains a significant public health problem. Chronic unresolved inflammation in response to proinflammatory oral microbiome dysbiosis induces host-mediated destruction of the periodontal tissues. Periodontal regeneration efforts have shown limited success due to the inability to resolve inflammation. Resolution of inflammation is initiated by Specialized Proresolving lipid Mediators (SPMs). SPMs include the lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins, as well as their protein conjugates, which exhibit multipronged actions that improve the outcome of inflammation-related pathologies in experimental models and clinical trials. Human periodontal ligament stem cells human (PDLSC) release SPMs to regulate immunomodulatory and pro-healing properties. Among SPMs, Maresin 1 (MaR1) displays potent actions in regulating inflammation resolution and pain, wound repair and tissue regeneration. However, there is no defined mechanism by which MaR1 induces tissue regeneration, including bone. Our proposed research will address this gap by using a systems biology approach with LM-SPM metabolipidomics, and RNA-sequencing of PDLSC to discover possible pathways modulated by MaR1 in PDLSC tissue regeneration. By utilizing the American Yorkshire Pig as a large animal regeneration model, we will test the therapeutic potential of MaR1-enhanced PDLSC therapy for regeneration of periodontal tissues for translation to humans. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) To establish MaR1 biosynthetic pathway in PDLSC. 2) To define the mechanism by which MaR1 controls tissue regeneration. 3a) To demonstrate MaR1-enhanced PDLSC-mediated periodontal regeneration in the Pig. 3b) To elucidate the impact of MaR1 on combined BMP2-PDLSC treatment in the Pig. Results from these studies will address a mission of NIDCR: ”to support the development of human disease- and injury-relevant animal models for tissue regeneration of the oral and craniofacial complex, with preference given to large animal models.” 
The candidate is a dentist-scientist and is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Texas Health San Antonio. This proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and training plan to advance the candidate’s skills and knowledge in immunology, metabolipidomics, RNA-sequencing and translational science under the guidance of a strong team of NIH-funded scientists; Dr. Kenneth Hargreaves, Dr. Stephen Harris, Dr. Charles Serhan and Dr. George Huang. The proposal builds on the candidate’s previous research in stem cells, BMP2 and periodontium formation by integrating new areas of expertise. The plan includes a mentored phase designed to optimize learning and acquisition of new skills (K99) followed by the R00 phase, which is specifically designed to capitalize on the strengths of the applicant to develop a new path of research that will determine the role of resolution of inflammation and stem cells in BMP2 mediated regeneration. The R00 phase also includes residency training. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will position the candidate with a unique set of cross disciplinary skills that will enable her to transition to independence specializing in stem cell-based periodontal tissue regenerative therapies."

The CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) regulates neuronal processes critical for retrograde signaling to reduce
excessive neurotransmitter release, neuronal development in fetal and adolescent brain, and neuroprotection.
Cannabinoid Receptor Interacting Protein 1a (CRIP1a) is associated with neurodevelopment, sensory function,
seizures, and mental health (Oliver et al., 2020). CRIP1a is a 10-stranded β-barrel protein in the family of
lipidated-protein carriers (with UNC119 and PDE6δ) (Booth et al., 2021). Our studies demonstrate that CRIP1a
binds myristoylated myrGiα N-terminal 9-mer peptide and holo myrGiα. Based upon our major advance in
knowledge of the structure and function of CRIP1a, we hypothesize that CRIP1a functions to sequester or
shuttle Giα proteins, and that the CRIP1a-Giα interaction can be regulated by the CB1R C-terminus during
the agonist-stimulated G protein cycle, palmitoylation-depalmitoylation, Arl protein regulatory cycles,
and phosphorylation-dephosphorylation to control loading and release of Giα cargo. We propose to
investigate the CB1R associated proteins in the N18TG2 and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell models that
endogenously express the CB1R, CRIP1a and G proteins, as well as using in vitro experiments using purified
recombinant CRIP1a, myrGiα, Gβγ and CB1R C-terminal, as well as peptides derived therefrom.
The Aims are to determine:
1) selectivity for myrGiα as CRIP1a cargo using fluorescence polarization to monitor the binding of peptides
from lipidated Gz, Gs, Gq, and G12/13, various lipids (particularly myristate, palmitate), Gi peptide length and
amino acid sequence, and to define the mechanism by pulldown assays and X-ray structure determination of
these interactions using purified recombinant CRIP1a and peptides or full-length recombinant myrGiα, Gβγ and
CB1R C-terminal;
2) the interface of CRIP1a with the CB1R-G protein activation cycle (mechanism and cellular localization)
by quantitating CRIP1a-Giα co-immunoprecipitation from neuronal cell homogenates treated with GTPγS, full
(2-AG ether, CP55940, WIN55212-2) and partial (methanandamide, Δ9-THC) agonists, competitive antagonist-
inverse agonist (SR141716), and after Gi ADP-ribosylation with pertussis toxin. Cellular location of the CRIP1a-
Giα interaction will be quantitated using proximity ligation assays and subcellular fractionation;
3) the mechanism(s) for loading and unloading myrGiα into CRIP1a by quantitating the gel shifted CRIP1a-
Giα by co-immunoprecipitation in intact neuronal cells or homogenates, and determining myrGiα-CRIP1a
interaction using recombinant proteins to assess: a) roles of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation, b) regulatory
properties of Arl proteins, and c) regulation by phosphorylation of predicted sites on the surface of CRIP1a.
The results of our investigation of CRIP1a and CB1R at the structural and functional level will inform future
investigation of CRIP1a in models of human health and disease."

11197964,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The promise of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hSC-CMs) opens doors towards the feasibility
of personalized medicine against cardiac diseases and for performing more accurate drug discovery studies.
Moreover, hSC-CMs overcome the issue of species differences when using animal models for high throughput
screening studies. However, one of the bottlenecks for scaling up the use of hSC-CMs is their ability to accurately
reflect the native structure and function of adult human cardiomyocytes. Current efforts to address this critical
challenge involve maturation protocols that use biophysical cues such as electrical stimulation or substrate-
induced tissue alignment. Methods for electrical stimulation often utilize electrode contacts for field stimulation,
bulky instrumentation for combining electrical stimuli delivery with mechanical or sustained chemical stimulation,
or genetically modifying cells to be light-responsive. Although we have seen successes through these induction
and stimulation approaches, the field would benefit from a stimulation approach with minimal culture contact to
reduce risk of infection during long-term cultures, as well as a light-based approach with higher spatiotemporal
resolution than electrode-based stimulation. Here, we propose a new paradigm for stimulating hSC-CMs towards
maturation by interfacing these cells with peptide-based substrates that can induce tissue anisotropy and
are engineered to convert light to stimulatory cues. Our team will develop peptides functionalized with
chromophore units and cell-binding epitopes as materials that can be used for light-based stimulation of hSC-
CMs, in combination with induction of tissue alignment, towards maturation. The long-term goal of this project is
to establish light stimulation via engineered peptides as a viable method to stimulate cardiomyocytes and
promote hSC-CM maturation in an electrodeless and non-genetic manner. We hypothesize that transient
charging and other associated light-induced processes at the cardiomyocyte-biomaterial interface can influence
extracellular potential, resulting in the photostimulation of hSC-CMs towards maturation. Our rationale for
proposing a materials-based approach for stimulating hSC-CMs stems from previous reports of conjugated
polymers being used as a photoactive substrate for triggering action potentials of other excitable cells. To test
our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: (1) establishing design parameters for engineered
peptide substrates with optimal photostimulation efficiency; (2) test the cellular- and tissue-level impact of
peptide-mediated photostimulation in combination with anisotropic cues; and (3) elucidate the effect of the
proposed photostimulation method, along with anisotropy cues, on hSC-CM maturation. By establishing the
design rules for the proposed photoexcitable peptides for eliciting combinatorial cues to stimulate hSC-CMs and
ensure their capability to excite cardiac cells, this innovative approach offers a new strategy for a “wireless”
stimulation of cardiac tissues towards maturation, and can therefore significantly contribute towards addressing
the grand challenge of immaturity of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes."
11198078,"Head and neck cancers (HNCs) account for nearly 3% of all cancers in the U.S. and most
commonly affect aging individuals. While chemo-radiotherapy is the standard treatment
approach for HNC, the method is known to cause substantial side-effects. In particular,
anatomical changes occurring during the treatment may result in under-coverage of the clinical
target volume or over-dosage of organs at risk.
The project will develop novel optimization models for Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) – a
customized treatment planning approach for individual patients designed by evaluating the
systematic and random variations in tumor response. The models will use imaging data of tumor
volume and normal tissue complication probabilities to determine the optimal number and timing
of treatment replans. The models will provide personalized optimization through sequential
decision-making based on response to treatment, as well as optimization and evaluation of
simple threshold replanning policies often used by doctors. Optimal behavior in the face of
conflicting payer/provider perspectives for emerging technologies will also be analyzed using
mechanism design techniques. ART requires information about patient-state as well as transition
probabilities describing the tumor's evolution over time. Since the process inherently calls for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, the proposed optimization models use a Markov
Decision Process (MDP). The resulting optimal policies may be difficult to implement in practice,
especially in centers lacking state-of-the-art equipment. Therefore, the proposed work will further
evaluate simple threshold replanning policies using a bilevel programming framework. In
particular, the bilevel program will find threshold values for various patient classes by minimizing
the deviation from the MDP-prescribed policy.
The proposed framework offers multiple avenues for methodological contributions. The novel
MDP design framework is an incredibly powerful tool that can be used to model many
interesting questions. We will explore ways of discretizing the continuous state spaces and
estimating transition probabilities based on patient imaging data. We will explore algorithms for
solving bilevel programs, especially utilizing the structure and properties of the lower-level MDP
models. Finally, we will study applications of the principal-agent framework from economics in
modeling payer/provider interactions for emerging clinical therapies.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
This study uses novel models to develop and validate an integrated approach to reduce cancer
radiotherapy side effects while maintaining or improving cancer control. It will maximize efficiency for

11199027,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. In the Unites States, an estimated 151,300 Americans will be diagnosed with CRC and over 52,580 are expected to die from the disease in 2022 alone (https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/colorect.html). While the five-year survival rate for localized CRC is excellent at 90%, more than half of new CRC cases have the disease spread to regional lymph nodes and/or distant organs at the time of diagnosis. CRC with distant metastasis has a dismal five-year survival rate of 14.7%. These data clearly indicate that CRC-related mortality can be significantly improved if the disease is detected early and proper interventions could be deployed. Because CRC typically originates from precancerous colorectal polyps, routine colonoscopy screening provides an excellent opportunity to detect precursor or early lesions and reduce CRC-related morbidity and mortality. Indeed, the US Preventive Services Task Force recently updated its recommendation on CRC screening, noting the evidence that the screening in average-risk asymptomatic adults aged 50 to 75 years is of substantial benefit. Risk factors for CRC include age (>50), race (African American), obesity, cigarette smoking, type II diabetes, history of inflammatory bowel diseases, family history of colorectal polyps or CRC, and inherited genetic syndromes known to increase the CRC risks, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome. FAP and Lynch syndrome are caused by germline mutations in the APC gene and DNA mismatch repair genes, respectively. The management of individuals with hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes requires additional measures beyond what is recommended for the average-risk population to minimize the overall risk of cancer-associated morbidity and mortality. Management options for the confirmed mutation carriers include multiple aggressive screening, chemopreventive strategies, and prophylactic surgery. However, these interventions are associated with various degrees of adverse effects. Safer and more effective preventive measures are urgently needed for the individuals with FAP, Lynch syndrome, and other hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes. Fusobacteria are common human oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora isolated from dental plaque and gum diseases, but rarely detectable in the colorectum of healthy individuals. In recent years, the enrichment of a specific pathotype, Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), has been demonstrated in the colonic tissues and stools from patients with colorectal adenomas and CRC. Clinical evidence suggests that the prevalence of Fn progressively increases from dysplasia, adenomas to CRC and the higher amount of Fn is significantly associated with CRC with high microsatellite instability, which is caused by DNA MMR deficiencies as seen in Lynch syndrome-associated CRC. The potential association of Fn with CRC tumorigenesis has been examined in a mouse model of FAP. ApcMin/+ mice, which carry a nonsense mutation at codon 850 of the Apc gene, had a significantly accelerated onset and increased multiplicity of both small intestinal and colorectal tumors after oral inoculation of Fn. These data strongly suggested the tumor-promoting role of Fn in ApcMin/+ mice. Interestingly, Fn did not induce colitis in these animals, in contrast to enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, which has been shown to cause colitis and accelerate tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice. It has also been demonstrated that Fn promotes CRC, breast, and cervical cancer metastasis and can metastasizes with tumor cells. Although how Fn contributes to CRC tumorigenesis has yet to be fully elucidated, emerging evidence points to its virulence factors, such as FadA and Fap2, as potential enhancers of CRC tumorigenesis and progression. The Fap2 has been shown to bind to human T-cell immunoglobulin ITIM domain (TIGIT), an immunoglobulin superfamily receptor known to function as an immune co-inhibitory molecule. Fap2-binding to TIGIT on NK and other T cells protects tumor cells from NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and blocks effector T cell functions in the tumor microenvironment. TIGIT has also been shown to promote Treg function. Taken together, Fn may exert tumor promoting effects not only by promoting CRC tumor growth, but also by exploiting the immune-suppressive function of TIGIT via its virulence factor protein and contributing to tumor immune evasion mechanisms. Cancers caused by infectious agents are theoretically preventable, if one can prevent the infection, eradicate oncogenic pathogens before tumor development, or suppress the functions of oncogenic molecules. Prophylactic vaccines for human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus have been associated with significant reductions in infection rates, which are expected to result in the dramatic decrease in the incidence of cervical cancers and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Compared to the prevention of infection, the eradication of oncogenic infectious agents already colonized in the host is in general highly challenging, if not impossible. For example, the well-established eradication regimens for Helicobacter pylori, which increases the risk of noncardia gastric cancers, do not eradicate the bacteria in all cases. Rather, emerging resistance to multiple antibiotics appears to be contributing to the recent decline in the eradication rate. Alternatively, the host immune defense system may be fortified by pathogen-targeted vaccines, if they can boost anti-pathogen immunity and lead to the containment of infection or suppression of pathogen-mediated tumorigenic functions. Fn is a gram-negative anaerobic bacillus, and can be isolated from 60-70% of children aged 5-7 years. As with other gram-negative bacteria, Fn produces outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which contain much of the biological content of the Fn, but without replicative capacity and some of the soluble proteins found in OMVs may elicit anti-Fn immunity. As part of the PREVENT project to develop Fn OMV based anti-Fn vaccine (https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/9358850), the proteomic characterization of Fn OMV led to the identification of putative immunogenic components, some of which may be useful as anti-Fn vaccine antigens. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 revolutionized the implementation of mRNA-based vaccinology. In addition to modifications of mRNA such as with pseudouridine incorporation to reduce innate immune responses and mRNA purification methodologies to remove contaminants, the development of biocompatible LNPs significantly boosted the advancement of COVID and other mRNA-based vaccines. LNP-RNA vaccine platform offers several advantages over conventional protein-based vaccination, including a rapid development, refined adjustment of antigenic epitopes, easier scale-up and timely deployment. The current study aims to develop and evaluate the immunogenicity of soluble protein-based and LNP-RNA-based Fn vaccines and to determine anti-Fn activity and immunopreventive efficacy of Fn-associated CRC, using mouse models of FAP and Lynch syndrome."
10983638,"ABSTRACT
Sickle cell disease (SCD) results in premature aging and early mortality. Although we (using >15 years follow up
[f/u]) and others have shown that life expectancy in SCD has improved, adults with SCD still have a life
expectancy of only 58 years. Early mortality is associated with SCD-related end-organ damage, especially to the
heart, lung, kidneys and central nervous system, as well as with vaso-occlusive event frequency and biomarkers
such as sVCAM-1. Most remarkable, however, is that adults with SCD >50 years (now 13% of adults with SCD)
have physical function similar to non-SCD adults over the age of 80. While frequency of death peaks in the 5th
decade, a subpopulation of patients live into their 70's. Yet little is currently known about how best to evaluate
and care for SCD patients over age 50 or predict which patients will achieve that milestone. We hypothesize that
multi-omics, by representing several SCD-related and unrelated physiologic processes, strongly determine-by
direct and indirect effects-both SCD organ severity and survival. Analysis of these relationships can inform our
understanding of the variability in survival and the pace of aging in SCD. Elucidating the multi-omic contributions
to SCD severity and mortality will also be critical for developing models of assessment and care for this
population. NHLBl's TOPMed program is an extraordinary opportunity to facilitate personalized medicine for
SCD, including improving our understanding of factors affecting severity and mortality. Our cohort (OMG-SCD),
together with other TOPMed SCD cohorts, total >4000 samples with whole genome sequence (WGS) results
and rich clinical data, including organ-function phenotypes and clinical laboratory data; several studies also have
survival data. The OMG-SCD cohort also has stored plasma samples, some of which have previously been used
to identify proteins associated with kidney damage. Plasma protein activity can be modulated by N-linked
glycosylation and thus contributes to health and aging. Yet the role of proteomics and N-linked glycosylation is
unexplored in the context of aging in SCD. Discovery of proteomic biomarkers could illuminate the underlying
biologic mechanisms of accelerated aging and mortality in SCD. Here, we propose to: (1) Identify novel clinical
and 'omic risk factors, including telomere length, mitochondrial copy number, and clonal hematopoiesis, for organ
dysfunction and early mortality and (2) Identify proteomic and glycoproteomic biomarkers for premature mortality.
Our work is poised to yield significant discoveries regarding the nature of aging and to identify 'omic risk factors
of poor prognosis in SCD, thus facilitating precision medicine-guided care models in SCD."

11186084,"SUMMARY: OUTREACH CORE
The goals of the scientific portion of this proposal are directed towards bringing personalized medicine to the 
clinic for glioblastoma patients through integrative mathematical methods. Effectively bringing computational 
results into the clinic requires a broader understanding of the methods and general principles by scientists, 
clinicians, and patients alike. More scientists need to be aware of these non-traditional techniques in order to 
build additional models and enhance methodology for the clinic. Interpretation of model output for use in therapy 
will require clinicians to have a solid understanding of a given model’s strengths and limitations. Also, for patients 
to choose and feel confident in therapies directed by these techniques, they will require a broader awareness of 
the existence, potential benefit, and value of these therapies. The primary goal of the Outreach Core is to 
disseminate knowledge of mathematical oncology and cancer systems biology to students, colleagues, and the 
general public. To accomplish our goal, we will strive to appeal to each target group through the following:
Training new cross-disciplinary scientists. We will recruit undergraduate and graduate students along with 
postdoctoral trainees at our various institutions, providing them with opportunities for research and improving 
cross-disciplinary understanding. For undergraduates, this will take the form of internships, senior thesis projects 
and summer research experiences. For graduate students and postdoctoral trainees, this will take the form of 
longer-term research projects possibly culminating in master’s thesis and/or doctoral dissertation projects. 
Inform the research community. Beyond presenting our work at conferences targeting many different 
audiences, we will design conferences and workshops to attract clinicians and research scientists from multiple 
disciplines to inspire and update them about emerging research at the interface of oncology, mathematical 
modeling, and imaging.
Engage with the general public. We will develop an online, easily accessible presence by creating a website 
and using social networking platforms including Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. We will work with Mayo Clinic 
patient advocacy groups to engage brain tumor patients and their families by hosting informational workshops 
for brain tumor advocacy groups in our PNT lab at Mayo Clinic. In addition, we will partner with the Mayo Clinic 
Cancer Education Center to host the general public through evening and weekend workshops designed for a lay 
audience. 
Outcome assessment We will assess the success of our outreach efforts across each sphere of influence."

11055095,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human cell division is regulated at the G1/S transition before DNA is replicated. The primary drivers of cells 
through the G1/S transition are the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6 in complex with D-type cyclins. 
The goal of this project is to determine the mechanisms that Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes use to drive cell division. 
This is important for cancer because Cdk4/6 activity is elevated in many cancers including breast cancers, brain 
cancers, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and neuroblastoma tumors. Inhibiting Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 is therefore a 
promising avenue for therapies targeting these cancers. Here, we propose to determine how Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 
drives the G1/S transition. First, we will do this by identifying all the targets of Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 kinases in cells 
using a chemical genetic approach. Second, we will determine the molecular mechanism Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 uses 
to dock and phosphorylate its primary target, the retinoblastoma protein Rb. In preliminary data, we discovered 
that Cyclin D binds an alpha helix at the C-terminus of Rb. We now aim to determine the location on Cyclin D 
that docks Rb’s C-terminal helix using a combination of in vitro biochemistry and structural biology approaches.
We propose to use knowledge of this docking interaction to develop a tool compound that disrupts the interaction
and arrests the cell cycle. This will allow testing of the importance of the interactions in cells and provides a 
proof-of-principle that disrupting this interaction could be used in targeted cancer therapeutics. We will pursue 
two directions to identify a tool compound. First, we will develop a peptide inhibitor based on Rb’s C-terminal 
helix. Second, we will screen a small molecule library using a FRET assay. Taken together, the proposed
experiments will provide an in-depth analysis of the Cyclin D-Rb interaction and will determine how it drives cell 
division. The broader impact of this study of the Cyclin D molecular docking mechanism and identification of 
Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 substrates may be the identification of new small molecules that improve cancer therapy."
11175048,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
For patients with advanced cancer, 30% will be afflicted with brain metastases, the cause of devastating 
neurologic morbidity and mortality. As a result, the incidence of brain metastasis is 170,000 new cases per a 
year. For screening, MRI is the preferred imaging modality for brain metastasis, but is prohibitively expensive 
and lacks relevant molecular information. We lack predictive models to identify patients at high risk for brain 
metastases for screening, as treatment efficacy and morbidity are linked to early detection. Treatment involves 
surgery and radiotherapy but with a noticeable lack of prognostic or predictive biomarkers for disease 
progression or treatment. Our central hypothesis is that there are common intrinsic features to the tumor and
extrinsic features to the brain microenvironment relevant for cancer brain tropism and response to therapies. 
We will determine these features’ association to microglia (Project 2) and peripheral immune surveillance 
(Project 3), leveraging biological models to test these discoveries. We will identify intrinsic cellular genomic 
features relevant for brain metastasis that can be generalized across many primary tumor types. Likewise, we 
hypothesize there are extrinsic features of the tumor cellular milieu in the brain that facilitate the seeding and 
maintenance of these metastases. (1) For determining extrinsic cellular tropism, we will characterize the immune 
cell types’ states and function in the brain metastasis tumor microenvironment. Using single cell genomics, we 
will determine the distribution and functional status of the TME microglia and macrophages across different tumor 
types that have CNS metastasis. In parallel, using three dimensional organoids, we will determine the TME-based macrophage response to anti-CD47, a potent modulator of macrophage function. Our results will 
determine the cellular genomic characteristics and functional status of TME macrophages/microglial cells and 
their regulatory states. (2) For intrinsic tropism factors, we will analyze genomic features of the primary tumor 
and extrinsic features of the brain that indicate increased propensity for brain metastasis. We will conduct 
genomic sequencing analysis on matched primary and metachronous brain metastasis, with complete treatment 
exposure patient history. With this data, we will determine critical cancer genome features such as the extent of 
genomic instability, intratumoral clonal diversity, treatment selection pressure, and TME immune cell composition 
that are associated with brain metastatic risk. Our results will identify genomic biomarkers indicative of increased 
risk of brain metastasis across different tumor types. (3) Finally, we will use the overlapping data set for intrinsic 
genomic factors to determine if there are predictive genomic signatures of radioresistant brain metastases. We 
hypothesize there are specific genomic features of primary tumors that are radiotherapy predictors. These 
results may yield potential candidates for increasing sensitivity to this mode of treatment that can be tested in
vitro."
11190561,"Metabolic programs are particularly relevant during metastasis as it is an inefficient process 
comprising several consecutive steps, with only a small proportion of circulating tumor cells generating a 
metastatic lesion. The inefficiency is largely attributable to the host organ environments, which impose 
metabolic limitations on cancer cells. Indeed, cancer cells are frequently starved for nutrients and oxygen in 
distant organ environments due to poor vasculature. To endure unfavorable nutrient conditions during the 
metastatic cascade, disseminated tumor cells require substantial metabolic rewiring that enables them to 
grow at the primary and metastatic sites. Additionally, cancer cells metabolically interact with each other 
and with normal cell types or upregulate alternative pathways to overcome these metabolic limitations in 
their environment. Integration of nutrient availability from the local environment with metabolic adaptation 
signatures in cancer cells is key to understanding how cancer cells interact with the surrounding cells and 
extracellular nutrients. Furthermore, as re-population of cancer cells at a new organ site creates challenges 
for effective anti-tumor therapeutic strategies, there is an unmet basic and clinical need to better understand 
the molecular interplay between the metastatic site and tumor cells. Therefore, in this proposal, we will test 
the hypothesis that distant organ sites impose metabolic restrictions that cancer cells need to overcome for 
metastatic colonization. To address this, we will employ a comprehensive unbiased approach that combines 
multiple genetic, transcriptomic and metabolomics techniques. These approaches will enable us to dissect 
the metabolic heterogeneity of cancer cells and other cell types in distant organ sites. In the first aim, we will 
systematically map metabolic dependencies of breast cancer cells during colonization of the lung and liver 
using CRISPR-based loss and gain of function approaches. In our preliminary work, we have already 
identified potential candidates that are involved in breast cancer metastasis to lung. In the second aim, we 
will investigate the role of niche cells by combining cell-specific metabolomics and single-cell sequencing 
approaches in multiple metastasis models and in response to therapy. The Birsoy lab has recently pioneered 
the use of metabolism focused CRISPR screens to study multiple aspects of cellular metabolism in cancer 
models. The Cao and Saeed Tavazoie labs have expertise in single cell transcriptomics and computational 
biology. By integrating gene expression profiles and metabolomic information generated by this collaborative 
multidisciplinary effort, our work will provide entry points for identifying pathways that may be activated or 
repressed during the course of metastatic colonization and in response to therapy."
11178841,"Abstract/Project Summary
Metastatic breast cancer and relapse following therapy are dependent on (1) resistance to recognition and 
destruction of cancer cells by the immune system, and (2) development of intrinsic resistance to targeted and 
endocrine therapies. The study of these processes using in vitro cancer models have been limited in scale and 
often lack key properties of the tumor microenvironment. We recently developed a scalable cancer spheroid 
system that enabled the first genome-wide CRISPR screens in 3D culture; phenotypes in this system much 
better reflect in vivo tumors (Nature, 2020). In addition, we developed a magnetic separation strategy to rapidly 
identify regulators of phagocytosis by macrophages (Nature Genetics, 2018) and have successfully extended 
this strategy to study macrophage-tumor cell interactions. Here we will use these systems to identify 
regulators of therapeutic relapse and immune evasion in metastatic breast cancer.
To investigate mechanisms of relapse after therapy, we will focus on four ER+ breast cancer subgroups with 
high relapse risk previously identified by the Curtis Lab (Project 1). This has formed the basis of a biomarker-driven clinical trial targeting the presumed candidate drivers in these high-risk subgroups. Since the amplicons 
defining these subgroups each contain multiple genes, we will use functional CRISPR perturbations to test which 
genes (or combinations thereof) are the true drivers. Further, we will build on the comprehensive characterization 
of these tumors from transcriptomics (Project 1) and spatial proteomics (Project 2), adding functional 
measurements of the requirement for each altered factor in growth and resistance to therapy using high-throughput CRISPR screens. Together these studies will dramatically enhance our understanding of which 
genes are critical targets for improved therapies in high-relapse risk breast cancers.
To investigate how metastatic tumors evade the immune system, we will focus on macrophage-tumor 
interactions. Surprisingly, although macrophages comprise 50% of the cell mass of some tumors, breast 
cancer cells appear resistant to macrophage killing. This is largely due to anti-phagocytic signals expressed by 
cancer cells, including CD47; however, accumulating evidence points to the existence of additional,
unidentified anti-phagocytic signals in breast cancer. In addition, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are 
re-wired to support tumor development and have reduced phagocytosis. It remains unclear, however, which 
genes mediate resistance to phagocytosis in high-risk IC subtypes, and which macrophage genes underlie 
immunosuppression by metastatic breast cancers. Here, we will systematically identify genes limiting anti-cancer 
activity by macrophages by conducting CRISPR screens in both macrophages and cancer cells, making use of 
sophisticated ALI patient-derived organoid models to validate hits. These complementary approaches will 
functionally define breast cancer driver genes and therapeutic targets that control therapeutic response and 
immune evasion, informing the next generation of clinical trials."

Administrative Core will coordinate the participation of Center personnel to all Consortium activities, including 
attending meetings and workshops, contributing to working groups and technical committees, and interfacing 
with other NIH initiatives. Finally, it will support a broad educational program implemented through the Outreach 
core, aiming to expand inclusivity and diversity in Cancer Systems Biology by offering education and learning 
opportunities to underprivileged high school and college students from minority-serving institutions in New York 
City and other big cities."
11171864,"Understanding cancer cell-autonomous behavior and recruitment of pro-malignant subpopulations to the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) is critically dependent on the generation of accurate and comprehensive cellular and 
intercellular networks. The goal of Project 1 is to develop a novel, integrated, and extensively validated 
framework to model, manipulate, and dissect cell-cell signaling in the tumor microenvironment involving 
extracellular ligand-receptor interactions coupled to intracellular signaling networks. Project 1 will build on the 
methodologies and results generated during the previous CSBC funding period to address multiple challenges
by (a) expanding structure-informed prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPI) networks by leveraging novel 
deep learning approaches, (b) improving signal transduction networks based on the analysis of time-dependent 
drug perturbation assays, and (c) elucidating ligand/receptor-mediated paracrine interaction networks that 
mediate recruitment—and possibly reprogramming—of healthy cells to the TME to create a pro-malignant
environment. To accomplish these goals, the focus will be on two highly aggressive tumors—colon 
adenocarcinoma (COAD) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)—for which data, models, reagents, 
and analytical tools were generated during the prior funding cycle. 
Project 1 is based on three specific aims. Through the integration of deep learning approaches to protein-protein 
interactions and the creation of structure-based networks for the Hallmarks of Cancer, Aim 1 will provide a 3D-structural context for the proposed work throughout Project 1. Aim 2 will define phosphoproteomics-based 
intracellular signaling networks and describe their response to drug perturbations. Aim 3 will define paracrine-based cell-cell signaling networks and validate them with a novel organs-on-a-chip platform. 
The impact of Project 1 will derive largely from its innovative approaches, which include the use of structure-based analyses to model protein interaction networks; the integration of structure-based modeling with deep 
learning algorithms, including Protein Language Models, to provide models for essentially all interactions that 
will be predicted and observed in the proposal; the inference of phosphoproteomics-based phosphoprotein 
activity to provide critical time-dependent and perturbation-sensitive components of cellular signaling; the 
incorporation of paracrine signaling; and novel experimental validation technologies including matched 
phosphoproteomic and transcriptional profiles, and the bioengineering of tumors and normal cells within 
interconnected micro-chambers to better recapitulate tissue physiology in vivo.
The major deliverable for Project 1 is an interrogable and holistic model for coupled intra- and inter-cellular 
signaling which will serve as the foundation for the entire center by enabling the dissection of the mechanisms 
contributing to the stability of tumor-related cell states, their ligand/receptor-mediated interaction with other 
subpopulations in the TME, and their pharmacologically actionable molecular dependencies.

The proposed studies are highly relevant to 5U54CA272686-02, Cancer prevention-interception targeted agent discovery program at Fox Chase Cancer Center (PI Clapper, Margie L). The project originates from previous work in the Karanicolas laboratory (Project 1), which focused on using computational, structure-based methods to develop compounds that bind and stabilize the folded (active) conformation of tumor suppressors bearing missense mutations. Germline or somatic mutations reducing the expression or function of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor are the most common genetic features of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), with many of these mutations being missense. Beyond ccRCC, individuals with germline VHL mutations are at elevated risk for numerous other cancers, including most commonly pancreatic cancer, hemangiomas and hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system and retina, and cysts in the kidney, pancreas, and other tissues. Evidence in the scientific literature suggests that pathogenic missense mutations impact VHL function by: 1) Increasing the ratio of partially unfolded or misfolded (dysfunctional) protein to functional protein; or 2) disrupting specific contacts between VHL and essential protein partners. Using computational modeling approaches, we identified a specific, novel binding pocket on the VHL protein surface, and generated small molecules compounds predicted to bind this site and stabilize the ratio of folded to unfolded VHL, boosting protein function. Preliminary experiments using NMR established the ability of a lead compound, CP4.29, to bind to the predicted site. We also showed that this compound was active in stabilizing VHL in ccRCC cell lines bearing 3 discrete somatic VHL mutations (P86S, S65W, and I180N). Critically, the compound also restored a critical VHL function - formation of an E3 ligase complex that causes the degradation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs, which include HIF-1 and HIF-2). We have also generated a number of structurally modified variants of CP4.29, with the goal of potentially increasing potency and solubility. The goal of this supplement is to specifically determine whether these compounds are effective in reversing the dysfunction induced by germline mutations in VHL that occur in discrete protein domains."

11181795,"Patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have few effective therapeutic options available. Most patients quickly develop resistance to current therapies and progress to metastatic disease which is universally lethal. Current treatments for PDAC include chemotherapy combination of 5- fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. To study the tumorspecific chemotherapy response, we established a robust 3D culture method to propagate patient-derived organoids (PDOs) ex-vivo and demonstrated that these models recapitulate the genomic and transcriptomic hallmarks of the disease. Importantly, we found that PDO-response to chemotherapy mimics patient-response. This pharmacotyping method allowed us to identify both chemosensitive and chemoresistant patient models. We find that gene expression regulating metabolic pathways are dramatically and specifically rewired in the sensitive and resistant PDOs. Importantly metabolic rewiring is a hallmark of cancer and PDAC and has been shown to promote resistance phenotype in patients and laboratory models. We therefore hypothesize that PDOs will have distinct metabolic profile associated with chemosensitivity and chemoresistance. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of PDAC contributes to the drug resistance phenotype observed in patients. Specifically, PDAC cells promote a metabolic rewiring in cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) which in turn contributes to chemoresistance. Furthermore, we and others have shown that chemoresistance-associated CAFs can reprogramed cancer cells to become more resistant to treatment therefore the cell-cell signaling that promotes and maintains chemoresistance is complex and involved both cancer intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Here we hypothesize that chemoresistance in PDAC is associated with metabolic rewiring in the cancer cells which promotes survival and alters the stromal microenvironment to further enhance metabolic resistance to chemotherapy."
11161932,"Overactive RAS signaling can drive cellular metabolic insufficiencies that promote a macropinocytic phenotype. In glioblastoma cells, uncontrolled oncogene-driven macropinocytosis can lead to methuosis, an understudied non-apoptotic form of cell death involving cell rupture due to an inability to process internalized macropinosomes. While this phenotype had previously only been shown to occur in glioblastoma cells in response to ectopic expression of constitutively active RAS, we recently demonstrated that EGFR amplification can also drive methuosis. This important observation may hold clues for new methods to treat glioblastoma because EGFR is frequently over-expressed in tumors. We hypothesize that some glioblastoma cells may be able to adapt to EGFR-driven methuosis stress and that learning how cells cope with the stress and process macropinosomes may reveal new therapeutic vulnerabilities for the treatment of glioblastoma. We propose that studying cytoskeletal dynamics and structure is an ideal way to pursue that hypothesis and deepen our understanding of the connection between EGFR and methuosis in glioblastoma. Indeed, the cytoskeleton is intimately involved in the formation and trafficking of macropinosomes, and both EGFR and RAS actively control the cytoskeleton at multiple levels. Our preliminary observations suggest that disrupting the intermediate filament and tubulin networks with inhibitors can forestall methuosis and that macropinosome accumulation leads to clear displacements of the normal cytoskeleton within cells. However, it is yet unclear if cytoskeletal perturbations (at all three levels of intermediate filaments, actin, and tubulin) precede and promote methuosis or occur as a consequence of methuosis. The Lazzara lab recently showed that over-expression of EGFR, a common occurrence in glioblastoma, promotes methuosis, an understudied form of cell death resulting from uncontrolled macropinocytosis leading to cell rupture. The cytoskeleton is intimately involved in macropinosome formation and trafficking, but the role of the cytoskeleton in methuosis has never been studied. In this project, a cancer systems biologist with expertise in EGFR signaling will collaborate with a cell biologist with expertise in live-cell imaging to determine if perturbations to the glioblastoma cell actin, tubulin, and intermediate filament networks lead to or result from methuosis, which may reveal methods to promote the phenotype therapeutically."
11066147,"Project Summary
Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people with HIV (PWH) has increased in the last 20 years, 
resulting in increased life expectancy and reduced mortality by 61% since its peak in 2004. As of 2016, 
nearly 50% of PWH in the United States were older than 50 years of age. Within this older population of 
PWH, age-associated comorbidities, including non-AIDS-defining cancers, are disproportionately higher 
than otherwise predicted. Even in the ART era, PWH are at increased risk for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma and endure substantially higher mortality from lymphoma than HIV-negative individuals. 
CD38 is a T cell marker that increases with HIV infection, cancer, and age, and is not normalized with 
use of ART and viral suppression. CD38 is overexpressed in lymphoma and persists due to chronic antigen 
stimulation and promotes tumor growth via dysregulated production of tumor-promoting cytokines, making 
it a proposed target for lymphoma treatment. In addition to being a lymphocyte marker, CD38 is also an 
ectoenzyme that is mainly responsible for catalyzing intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).
NAD+, like CD38, has been linked to multiple pathways underlying tumor growth, and studies of animal 
models have suggested that increasing intracellular NAD+ levels may prevent cancer.
Currently, there are no data on how CD38 influences tumor growth in PWH or how targeting CD38 can 
reverse its effect. We hypothesize that exacerbated CD38 expression in PWH is a crucial factor for promoting 
tumor growth and is associated with effector T cell dysfunction. We plan to test our hypothesis using two 
experimental models. First, we will determine if CD38 is associated with effector T cell dysfunction (by 
measuring checkpoint proteins) and production of tumor-promoting cytokines using blood and lymphoma 
tissue samples from PWH and HIV-negative controls at least 50 years of age. Next, using an HIV-infected
humanized mouse model with lymphoma, we will target CD38 directly and indirectly by using a monoclonal 
antibody against CD38 and NAD+ precursor. We will determine which strategy results in maximal tumor 
growth inhibition with minimal toxicity. 
We expect to demonstrate that PWH have exacerbated CD38 expression in lymphoma. Second, we 
expect to demonstrate that in PWH and lymphoma, increased CD38 expression on effector T cells are 
associated with increased checkpoint proteins and increased production of tumor-promoting cytokines. Last, 
we expect to demonstrate that targeting CD38 may be a potential therapeutic adjunct to chemotherapy and 
ART for PWH with lymphoma. The goals of this proposal directly align with the NIH HIV/AIDS Research 
Priority as described in NOT-OD-20-018, as it investigates virus/host cell interactions and pathogenesis (the 
interplay between HIV and host CD38), immune dysfunction and persistent inflammation, and long-term 
treatment or prevention strategies for HIV-relevant comorbid conditions across the lifespan."
11186186,"SUMMARY: BIOSPECIMEN CORE
The major objective of the Biospecimen Core is to obtain, process, image, and analyze glioblastoma (GBM) 
patients’ biopsies for use in both Projects of our Mayo/Columbia CSBC Mathematical Oncology Systems 
Analysis Imaging Center (MOSAIC). Patient biopsies are central to our CSBC’s primary goal: building a 
conceptual framework to understand sensitive response to therapy through the represented tissue states in 
clinical and experimental settings. The duties of the Biospecimen Core are spread across both sites: Mayo 
Clinic Arizona (MCA) and Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC).
The Biospecimen Core will assist the Center by operating under two specific aims. In Aim 1, we collect, process, 
and analyze image-guided biopsies from pre-and post-treatment GBM. For Aim 2, we perform histopathological, 
immunohistochemical (multiplex-IHC), and molecular analyses (bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq) of image-guided
biopsies.
The Biospecimen Core will provide support for both projects.
Project 1: Targeting Glioma Tissue States will utilize the RNAseq and single cell sequencing data from the 
biopsies collected and analyzed by the Biospecimen Core to assess the compositional landscape of 
glioblastoma along with the cross-talk between different subgroups that influence phenotype.
Project 2: Imaging the Dynamic Tissue State in Patients In Vivo will utilize the bulk histology and RNAseq 
along with the imaging of the image-localized biopsies collected from the Biospecimen Core. Project 2 will 
also incorporate these histologic and molecular cell lineage data into ML and mechanistic models that map the 
relationship of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features to cellular composition. These data will drive the 
training and validation of machine learning models and the parameterization of mechanistic mathematical 
models. 
The data generated by the Biospecimen Core will be transferred to the Data Integration and Computation 
Core, where it will be stored, further processed including batch correction and atlas alignment, and integrated 
into computational modeling tools."
11186081,"SUMMARY: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The overarching objective for the Mayo/Columbia MOSAIC CSBC is to build a conceptual framework to 
understand tissue state transitions that happen in glioma and the ways to interpret magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) relative to those changes for these key cellular phenotypes. Achieving this objective will require a multi-faceted approach reflected by the multiple projects and cores being proposed. The administrative core will be 
the primary touchpoint for all pieces of the proposal, overseeing that work is done in an efficient way and 
providing the necessary administrative support to coordinate all efforts. The central work for our CSBC revolves 
around extensive analysis of image-localized biopsies that are collected, processed, and stored by Biospecimen
Core, analyzed by the Data Integration and Computation Core, and shared between Projects 1 and 2. This 
highly integrated analysis of image-localized biopsies from GBM patients with clinical imaging will be actively 
managed by the Administrative Core to ensure a smooth experimental flow with an emphasis on quality and 
reproducibility. 
We envision that MOSAIC will serve as a nexus for collaborations focused on the topics revolving around tissue 
state transitions and clinical imaging across the consortium with likely areas of interest in other cancers beyond 
glioma. A key function of the Administrative Core will be to actively cultivate such collaborations through 
coordination with our Outreach Core, particularly through administering Intra-Center and Cross-Consortium Pilot 
Projects, hosting workshops and symposiums, and facilitating visiting faculty all while enhancing diverse 
perspectives on this critical topic. These activities will extend both to collaborations between institutions involved 
in the Mayo/Columbia CSBC and collaborations across the U54 and U01 holders within the CSBC and PSON 
networks.
In the Administrative Core, our aims—to manage center logistics and communication, administer Intra-Center 
Pilot Projects, and create and support the External Advisory Committee—will support all aspects of our 
application. Co-PDs Swanson and Canoll will provide the central leadership in the Administrative Core, while 
the Center Program Administrator will provide day-to-day business, administrative and scientific management of 
Center activities."
11171865,"Aggressive cancers often lack pharmacologically actionable mutations and do not respond to immune checkpoint 
blockade, thus deriving only modest clinical benefit from targeted and immune therapy. The heterogeneity of 
both transformed and healthy cells in the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) represents a critical obstacle to 
achieving more durable response in cancer patients. Recent insights, using multi-omics approaches, have shown 
that cancer cells can exist in a variety of transcriptionally distinct, yet co-existing states, some of which are 
already primed for metastatic progression or drug resistance. The plasticity of these states—i.e., the ability of 
cancer cells to reprogram across multiple states, either spontaneously or because of drug perturbations—and 
their homeostatic coexistence with other TME subpopulation, via paracrine molecular interactions, creates a 
constant challenge to therapeutic approaches by fostering the emergence of drug-resistance, tumor progression, 
and the creation of a pro-malignant, immunosuppressive milieu. Malignant states and transitions are only partially 
explained by sequential acquisition of somatic mutations, suggesting that they result from integration of a variety 
of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic molecular cues that determine their lineage attribution, establishment, and 
interconversion. To date, several technical, clinical, and analytical challenges have hampered a comprehensive 
understanding of the natural biology of these processes in patients. Project 2 is dedicated to resolving the 
variability and plasticity of malignant cells and of the healthy cells that define the TME by developing and applying
a battery of technical and analytical tools for the dissection of cancer heterogeneity at the single-cell level, and 
for the nomination, validation and testing of novel drivers of tumor-progression and therapy response and 
resistance. We will delineate these concepts in a defined biological context, that is the progression from a primary 
tumor towards brain-metastatic disease. To this end, we will leverage a series of innovations from CaST 
investigators, including (a) multi-modal single-cell profiling from archival tissues, (b) simultaneous low-pass
whole-genome sequencing (lpWGS) of the same cell pool, (c) integrated single-cell and spatial single-cell 
transcriptomics, (d) analytical approaches to integrate and model multi-modal single-cell data in space, time and 
context of interactions among cells, (e) tools to elucidate cell state stability and transitions, (f) combinations of 
genome-editing perturbations with single-cell read outs that can be linked to drug screens via gene expression 
profiling, and (g) network-based Master Regulator analyses to elucidate mechanistic determinants of 
transcriptional cell state. This will be extended by experimental innovations, that (h) accurately model tumor 
progression in vivo and recapitulate entire human ecosystems, (i) enable labeling of metastatic niches coupled 
with single-cell genomics, and (j) provide a platform to test pharmacological modulation of cancer cell intrinsic 
and tumor-microenvironmental features predicted from human studies and modeling. The presented innovative 
framework will be broadly application to other cancer contexts.
Project Summary/Abstract"
11171866,"Patients with aggressive cancers often present with no pharmacologically actionable mutations and fail to 
respond to immune checkpoint blockade, thus deriving only modest improvement in disease-free survival from 
targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Tumor heterogeneity further complicates these challenges by fostering
paracrine signal-mediated reprogramming, adaptation, selection, and expansion of drug-resistant cell states, as 
well as emergence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which are ultimately responsible 
for patient relapse and poor outcome . We propose that addressing these challenges—i.e., identifying more 
universal, mechanistic targets for pharmacological intervention and assessing their potential value in highly 
heterogeneous tumors—is critically dependent on the availability of accurate and comprehensive cellular 
networks, which underlie both the cell-autonomous behavior of cancer cells and their interaction with other TME
subpopulations. In Project 3 we propose to match the proteome-wide Mechanism of Action (MoA) of clinically 
relevant compounds—as dissected from in our PanACEA database of genome-wide molecular perturbations in 
high-fidelity models of human malignancies—to the non-oncogene dependencies of molecularly distinct, yet 
coexisting subpopulations, representing either transformed, malignant cells or healthy cells recruited to the TME 
to create a pro-malignant, immunosuppressive milieu, as dissected by single cell analyses. Targeting individual 
subpopulations is becoming increasingly critical because the heterogeneity and plasticity of both transformed 
and non-transformed TME subpopulations have emerged as, perhaps, the most fundamental obstacles to 
achieving durable responses in cancer patients and distinct subpopulations appear to either have potentially 
orthogonal drug sensitivities or to represent healthy, immunosuppressive cells that will require an entirely 
different approach to targeting their recruitment to the TME rather than causing their demise. To accomplish 
these goals, Project 3 will leverage data, models and reagents generated during the prior CSBC funding cycle 
for the study of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC), two aggressive, highly heterogeneous malignancies, with ≤ 20% 5-year survival. We will focus on 
mCRPC and on its aggressive neuroendocrine subtype (NEPC) to explore a novel molecular triangulation 
methodology (OncoLoop) designed to identify high-fidelity models—i.e., cell lines, organoids, genetically 
engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and patient derived xenografts (PDXs)—to generate patient-relevant drug 
perturbation profiles in vitro and to validate drugs predicted from patient-derived sample analysis in preclinical 
models in vivo. We will then focus on 6 molecularly distinct malignant PDAC subpopulations—comprising 
Lineage, Morphogenic, and Acinar to Ductal Metaplasia-like cells, each detected in either a MAPK pathway 
active or inactive state—exploring multiple pro-malignant TME subpopulations (including tumor infiltrating T 
regulatory cells, macrophages and fibroblasts), to identify small molecule inhibitors that effectively deplete them.

will be leveraged as the foundation for the proposed core ForCaST (outreach For CaST) to meet the education 
and outreach challenges put forth by the Cancer Systems Biology Consortium (CSBC). ForCaST will expand the 
scope of CaST Outreach to 1) develop widely accessible containerized software environments with tutorials and 
case studies for CaST tools; 2) forge new partnerships with cancer researchers and clinicians; 3) cultivate the 
next generation of diversity-promoting scientists; 3) strengthen connections with students from groups that are 
underrepresented in STEM disciplines; and 4) foster systems approaches in science more generally.
The overall mission of ForCaST will be realized synergistically through its Specific Aims: 1) WebCaST (Webbased CaST resources) for online containerized packages that will combine CaST publications and resources 
with documented and video tutorials, domain-specific case studies, and computational workflows to facilitate 
dissemination and adoption; 2) WebCaST-High (WebCaST for high school students) that will introduce highschool students from nine high schools in NYC, LA, and Detroit, to exploratory analysis of cancer data and 
computational systems biology; 3) BroadCaST (Broadly accessible CaST research) for equipping students from 
Brooklyn College for graduate training at Columbia and careers in biomedical sectors; 4) StudioCaST (Studio art 
in CaST) for the creation of Visual Language at the intersection between Science and Art to offer novel learning 
perspectives and to palpably translate experiences associated with a cancer diagnosis to researchers and 
students; and 5) CaSTanet (CaST networks for inclusion) for mentoring postdoctoral scientists to provide 
equitable opportunities in their future roles at academic institutions as faculty members, instructors, lab heads, 
mentors, and reviewers.
ForCaST has already established key partnerships to support the proposed activities including 1) resource 
sharing with the CSBC and broader Columbia communities such as the Columbia University Cancer Research 
Career Enhancement Core (CRCE); 2) collaborations with Columbia University and Brooklyn College Continuing 
Umbrella of Research Experiences (CURE); 3) partnerships with high schools through Columbia CURE and the 
Palazzo-Strozzi Foundation; and 4) the creation of a new CSBC working group – Navigating Cancer with Science

11195859,"Over 60% of women report cognitive symptoms during the menopause transition, but few effective 
treatments are available. These symptoms are bothersome and impair work performance. In the long 
term, they may indicate underlying risk for chronic health conditions. We propose to study the 
interrelationships between protective and risk factors for cognitive symptoms during the menopause 
transition. In Aim 1 we will quantify the relative contributions of risk factors associated with 
cognitive symptoms in peri- and recently post-menopausal women with at least one cardiometabolic 
risk factor. We will investigate the proportion of variance in cognitive performance accounted for 
by cardiometabolic risk factors, vasomotor symptoms, sleep disruptions, and psychological factors. 
We will use electronic health records to identify and recruit a diverse sample of women. 
We will obtain high quality measures of cardiometabolic risk, vasomotor symptoms, sleep, physical 
activity, and psychological symptoms along with a battery of cognitive assessments in multiple 
domains. Establishing the relative strength of these contributing factors will lead to more 
targeted mechanistic hypotheses and inform intervention strategies benefiting cognitive function. 
Aim 2: Investigate habitual physical activity as a potential protective factor for cognitive 
performance via its effects on sleep and vasomotor symptoms in peri- and recently post-menopausal 
women. Exercise interventions improve vasomotor symptoms, sleep, and cognition. Less well 
established is whether habitual physical activity is a protective factor for cognition in 
perimenopause. Objective measurement of vasomotor symptoms, physical activity, and sleep are needed 
because self-report is less strongly associated with cognition than self-report. We hypothesize 
that higher levels of habitual moderate to vigorous physical activity will be associated with less 
severe vasomotor symptoms, fewer nighttime awakenings, and better cognitive performance. Further, 
we hypothesize that fewer awakenings will mediate the relationship between nighttime vasomotor 
symptoms and cognitive performance. Findings will inform future 
non-pharmacological strategies for maintaining cognition in the menopause transition. Our proposal 
is innovative in its simultaneous use of objective, physiological measures of physical activity, 
sleep, and vasomotor symptoms and quantification of potential risk and protective factors for 
cognition during the menopause transition. It will use bioinformatic tools to identify and recruit 
a diverse set of participants. These aims align with calls from organizations like The Menopause

11186082,"SUMMARY: PROJECT 1: TARGETING GLIOMA TISSUE STATES
Glioblastoma (GBM) displays extensive cellular heterogeneity which represents a major obstacle for effective 
treatment. This cellular heterogeneity not only consists of multiple tumor cell mutation factors that drive distinct 
tumor cell behavior, but also impacts various non-tumor cells, contributing to tumor initiation, progression, and 
treatment response. In fact, GBM’s microenvironment is multifaceted and consists of soluble factors, extracellular 
matrix components, tissue-resident cells (neuron, astrocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, etc.) and resident (e.g. 
microglia) or recruited (e.g. bone-marrow derived macrophages) immune cells. Importantly, changes in the 
cellular composition and cellular phenotypes can alter GBM tissue states to drive tumor growth and therapeutic 
resistance. Thus, identifying the unique cellular composition and deciphering the multifaceted bidirectional 
network between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment signals in various GBM tissue states can lead to 
identification of novel therapeutic strategies. 
Our preliminary studies using single nucleus RNAseq of pre- and post-treatment GBM has identified 3 tissue 
states, corresponding to patterns of cohabitation of tumor and non-tumoral cell subpopulations. These 
correspond to infiltrated brain, highly cellular proliferating tumor, and astrocytic / inflamed reactive tissue, which 
is observed in the post-treatment samples and enriched in specific populations of myeloid cells and 
mesenchymal glioma cells. Co-habitation of specific non-tumor cellular phenotypes in the glioma 
microenvironment may influence glioma states signatures (astrocyte-like/mesenchymal, progenitor, proliferative) 
that associate with tumor progression and therapeutic response. The goal of this project is to define the patterns 
of cellular cohabitation associated with the tissue states and the cross-talk signals that influence local tissue 
state, phenotypic expression, transitions and disease progression. Because of its known role in cross-talk 
between specific populations in GBM, we will initially test the effects of targeting TWEAK-Fn14 signaling to drive 
changes in tissue state. We hypothesize that targeting this as well as other key cross-talk signaling pathways
will induce tissue state transitions with corresponding alterations in cellular populations that will render tumors 
more sensitive to therapeutic vulnerabilities and can be leveraged to slow tumor growth/progression. 
To investigate the potential impact of such key states and their cross-talk, we propose three aims. Aim 1 focuses 
on refining our understanding of glioma tissue states in both the pre- and post- treatment setting. Aim 2
investigates cross talk between the glioma cells and their microenvironment and how it may influence 
progression. Aim 3 looks more locally at how cross-talk perturbations may impact tissue state transition."
11186083,"SUMMARY: PROJECT 2: IMAGING THE DYNAMIC TISSUE STATE IN PATIENTS IN VIVO
With a dismal median survival of 16 months, glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain 
tumor within adult patients. Response to the standard-of-care (SOC) is widely variable across patients. 
Identifying optimal targeted treatments traditionally relies on tissue sampling to identify patient-relevant targets. 
Yet, tissue sampling has many severe limitations and costs (time, money, and facility access), and ultimately 
provides only limited scope both spatially and temporally thus always leaving behind residual tumor cells that 
have not been sampled. Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures an array of 
complementary physiologic biomarkers that correspond with diverse tumor phenotypes (e.g., proliferation, 
inflammation, angiogenesis), and it serves as the clinical mainstay for monitoring therapeutic response and 
disease progression. As tumor cell signaling may be mediated through interactions (i.e.,“cross-talk”) with 
surrounding non-tumoral cells in the regional microenvironment, there is a critical need to define the degree to 
which this cross-talk influences local tissue state, phenotypic expression, and disease 
progression. Understanding these associations should help refine the clinical interpretations of imaging 
phenotypes to improve guidelines for non-invasive diagnosis and disease monitoring. There is an urgent need 
for image-based radiomics tools that can 1) predict which patients will respond to a given treatment and 2) can 
observe/track that response over time.
Overall Hypothesis: Tissue states, represented as combinations of cellular constituents and phenotypes, can be 
resolved on clinical imaging to a level sufficient to identify transitions in these states with and without treatments 
in individual patients in vivo. 
Our two aims in this project investigate this hypothesis in two separate settings, Aim 1) Standard of Care, Aim 
2) Immunotherapy. In these aims, we will characterize the landscape of phenotypic states, build image-based 
models to predict tissue state from images, investigate how predicted tumor states correspond with outcomes, 
quantify dynamics of states from pre- to post-therapy, and finally build mechanistic models to understand the 
critical driving differences in the flow of cells in local phenotype state space leading to the overall tumor state."

Every year, millions of patients suffer from impaired wound healing due to injuries, surgeries, and

remodeling, and often results in scarring. In diabetic patients or large wounds, insufficient

in local macrophages (Mφs), promoting their angiogenic signaling and tissue repair without 
causing inflammation. In preliminary work, AN delivery in a gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)-based 
hydrogel significantly enhanced angiogenesis in a murine skin wound model, both in wild type 
and in diabetic mice. Furthermore, addition of AN and/or GelMA to macrophages in culture 
stimulated their secretion of angiogenic growth factors. We propose here to investigate the effects 
of GelMA-AN on Mφ uptake and growth factor secretion (Aim 1), and on angiogenesis and wound 
healing of a full-thickness skin wound (Aim 2). This project will establish a new method to enhance 
Mφ angiogenesis signaling, providing a platform for further investigation, and developing a 
therapeutic intervention for improved wound healing. This proposed approach leverages the role 
of immune cells and angiogenesis in wound healing, with modulation of Mφs phenotype 
conversion for successful wound healing and tissue repair."
10989372,"The decision to perform a biventricular repair (BiVR) or single ventricle palliation (SVP) in patients born with a 
borderline left ventricle (BLV) remains challenging and subjective. BLV patients are neonates born with an 
underdeveloped left ventricle but not severe enough to be classified as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). 
A BiVR is attractive because it restores two functioning ventricles, though it is technically challenging to perform 
on neonates. In contrast, SVP involves multiple staged open-heart procedures resulting in alternative physiology 
with a single pumping chamber. HLHS patients undergoing SVP have high interstage mortality and poor longterm outcomes, with only 70% reaching adulthood. Current clinical guidelines are primarily governed by 
morphological measurements and status quo hemodynamic data that have mixed correlations with operative 
outcomes. Alternative palliative procedures were developed for specific BLV variants that delay the decisionmaking between BiVR and SVP and allow the left heart structures to grow before further interventions, such as
the hybrid approach and staged left ventricular rehabilitation (SLVR). However, about two-thirds of these patients 
do not respond favorably to these palliative procedures, and it is unclear if a BiVR is feasible in these patients
even at a later stage. There is an unmet clinical need to identify the BLV patients favorable for BiVR and perform 
risk stratification based on predicted postoperative outcomes. We aim to address this critical need by applying 
personalized computational modeling to predict and compare the immediate postoperative outcomes of virtual 
BiVR and Norwood and choose a procedure that yields the most favorable hemodynamics. Our modeling 
framework relies on a closed-loop lumped parameter network (LPN) that is elegant and enables prediction in a 
clinically adoptable timeframe for neonates. We demonstrated the model’s utility in a small patient cohort 
selected retrospectively and found that our model predictions support the clinical choice of surgery. Here, we 
aim to enhance the robustness of the modeling pipeline by (a) using the patients’ ultrasound data as input to the 
model, (b) automatically estimating the personalized LPN model parameters using a robust statistical framework, 
(c) performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) to measure confidence intervals on the predicted hemodynamic 
variables, and (d) demonstrating statistical significance on a larger cohort. We will apply our computational 
framework to assess the viability of performing a BiVR after initial hybrid palliation or SLVR. In Aim 1, we will 
develop a robust automatic tuning framework to estimate the LPN model parameters matching a BLV patient’s 
preoperative echo data. In Aim 2, we will perform UQ analysis to estimate the confidence in the predicted 
postoperative hemodynamics. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the feasibility of performing a BiVR after an initial 
palliative procedure. Ultimately, this simulation-guided treatment planning will mitigate the risk of morbidity and 
mortality and reinterventions in this critical population.
Project Summary/Abstract"
10995034,"Project Summary
Earlier gains in reducing prostate cancer (PCa) mortality, partially due to advances in screening and the use of
androgen deprivation therapy to treat metastatic PCa (mPCa), have not been sustained in recent years. Current
clinical and research challenges include overtreatment of patients with low probability of progression, no effective
therapy for metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC), and the persistent health disparities in PCa for
African American men. A better understanding of the molecular dynamics and interactions among cancer and
non-cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment CTME) at high resolution and in a spatial context across time
will be crucial for addressing these challenges. Against the backdrop of recent advances in multi-omics and
spatial technologies, we propose to use our expertise in the latest technological platforms, experience in atlas
building, and strengths in PCa research and treatment at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) to
extend our prior HTAN work to PCa. The proposed Human Prostate Tumor Atlas Center (HPTAC) will elucidate
PCa architecture, cellular dynamics, TME interactions, and temporal evolution via the building of a molecularly
resolved spatial atlas that integrates multi-omics, imaging, and clinical data, with a focus on spatial
characterization with maximum optical display of molecular and cellular features. We will procure both
retrospective and prospective PCa specimens with detailed clinical data at WUSM, which maintains a
comprehensive repository of PCa specimens and has a high PCa patient volume (Aim 1). These specimens will
span two critical transitions: from indolent to aggressive PCa and from hormone-sensitive to castration-resistant
metastatic PCa. The high percentage of African American patients in our PCa patient population permits a 50%
composition of African American specimens to investigate the biological basis for disparities associated with
African ancestry. Aim 2 concentrates on molecular and spatial characterization of PCa specimens. At the core
of the spatial characterization are spatial-omics, including sequencing-based (Visium/Curio Seeker) and
imaging-based (Xenium/CosMx) platforms, 2D/3D imaging modalities, including CODEX, 3D in vitro Light Sheet
Fluorescence Microscopy, and in vivo MRI/DBSI imaging. These technologies will be augmented by bulk and
single cell omics for mutations/ancestry detection and overall molecular profiling. In Aim 3, data will be analyzed
and integrated into a molecularly resolved spatial atlas of PCa. Co-registration, reconstruction, and integration
will be achieved by employing computational tools, such as PASTE2, Morph, Mushroom. The resulting atlas will
describe molecular, cellular, and spatiotemporal relationships of cellular and non-cellular components of the PCa
ecosystem across critical transitions. In Aim 4, we will establish a collaborative infrastructure within our HPTAC
and foster collaborations across HTAN centers. Data will be deposited with the HTAN Data Coordination Center
in accordance with FAIR standards. Methodologies developed in, and findings from this study will have broad
impact on atlas building for other cancers and on addressing some of the most pressing challenges in PCa."

10882141,"The search for molecular targets and pathways that can be manipulated to improve bone properties is a highly
active area of investigation. Recently, particular interest has been expressed in targeting biomolecules that can
augment mechanical signaling in bone; the next generation of osteoporosis drugs is likely to work in conjunction
with physical activity/loading in order to disproportionately direct new bone formation to the skeletal loci that need
it most (i.e., those loci that endure the greatest strains and are at the greatest risk of failure). The WNT signaling
pathway has emerged as a key regulator of bone mass and strength, but also of bone cell mechanotransduction.
Recent clinical approval of the osteoporosis therapy Evenity™ (i.e., Romosozumab-aqqg) has highlighted the utility
and potency of targeting the WNT pathway to improve skeletal properties and fracture resistance. However, the
FDA issued a black-box label to the product because of its side effects on cardiovascular function and health. Recent
work suggests that the effects of WNT stimulation on bone formation can be isolated from those on cardiovascular
function, but the molecular mechanisms driving these disparate processes are completely unknown. The
goal of the present is application is to understand precisely how LRP5 and LRP6--two structurally related cell surface
proteins that function as WNT co-receptors--differ in their skeletal and non-skeletal contexts, with the goal of
exploiting signaling differences to improve clinically based WNT therapeutic outcomes (e.g., sclerostin inhibition).
Among the key questions addressed are: (1) Do LRP5 and LRP6 exhibit different predilection, or selectivity, to different
WNT ligands in bone cells in vivo? (2) Does LRP5 activation trigger different downstream signaling networks
than activated LRP6? (3) Is LRP6 involved in mechanotransduction in bone (overuse and/or disuse)? (4)
Can activation of LRP5 alone (through sclerostin antibody-mediated inhibition or by gain-of-function mutation in
the receptor) improve bone properties to a greater extent than activation of LRP6 alone? and (5) Are cardiovascular
effects differentially affected by LRP5 vs LRP6 signaling (in isolation)? We will use cutting-edge mouse models,
microscopic techniques, single cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches, mechanotransduction models, and radiographic/
histologic/biochemical approaches to reveal the underlying biology and therapeutic potential/differences
of LRP5 and LRP6 in bone tissue. The project is a continuation of the close collaboration between the Robling
(Indiana University) and Warman (Harvard University) labs, an extremely fruitful partnership for more than 18 yrs.
We have assembled a unique combination of expertise, resources, biological models and tools, and technical innovation
to elucidate, distinguish, and exploit the differing roles of LRP5 and LRP6 in bone biology and disease.
Project Summary/Abstract"
11124964,"Next Generation T cell therapies for childhood cancers [NexTGen] Current treatments fail to cure many children with solid cancers. Recent advances in adult cancers such as checkpoint blockade and targeted small molecules have made little impact in childhood disease. Engineered T-cell therapies can achieve durable responses in refractory lymphoid cancers without long-term toxicity. These are precisely the characteristics required for new treatments for pediatric solid cancers. In contrast to hematologic malignancies, solid cancers are challenging due to a lack of targets, tumor heterogeneity, and hostile tumor microenvironment (TME). We posit that through advanced cellular engineering we can overcome these challenges. Our vision is that engineered T-cell therapy for childhood solid cancers will become routine within a decade. Our central hypothesis is that coupling of advanced cellular engineering along with progressive clinical development is the fastest route to developing effective T-cell therapies for pediatric solid tumors. In NexTGen, we combine detailed studies of primary tumors to discover new targets and understand how the TME subverts T- cell function. This, along with a closely coupled clinical development program will guide the progressive engineering of T-cells to result in transformative therapies. NexTGen is composed of 6 inter-connected work-packages (WPs) with work initially focused on pediatric sarcomas and brain tumors. AIMS: WP1: To identify suitable targets for engineered T-cells. WP2: To understand the TME in pediatric solid cancers. WP3: To develop receptors and other engineering components which target tumor cells and resist or modulate the TME. WP4: To evaluate the function of engineered T-cells developed in WP3. WP5: To translate approaches from WP4 and test them in clinical studies designed for maximal impact. Cancer Grand Challenges - Full Application - 2021 WP6: To promote data sharing across all WPs. METHODS: Target discovery (WP1) and TME studies (WP2) will utilize mass spectroscopy and chip cytometry respectively. Component engineering (WP3) will use protein engineering methods. To model engineered cell function, WP4 will mostly use intact tumor models such as immune PDXs. In WP5, clinical product generation will involve autologous closed system semi-automated manufacturing. WP6 uses standard and custom databases and data sharing platforms. USE OF RESULTS: Tumor target and TME data from WP1 and 2 will be uploaded to databases developed by WP6 for widespread distribution. Engineering components from WP3 and functional data from WP4 will be available for incorporation into therapeutic T-cell strategies by the entire community. Clinical study data from WP5 should lead to registration studies, improving cure rates and mitigation of long-term toxicity to realize our Vision."

10989405,"Stuttering is a disorder of speech fluency that affects 3.5 million people in the USA alone. The primary symptoms 
consist of involuntary repetitions and prolongations of speech sounds, but many individuals who stutter also 
experience negative effects on emotional and social well-being, academic and professional achievement, self-esteem, relationships, and overall quality of life. Thus, stuttering is a significant public health issue and there is 
a great need for increased efforts to translate recent discoveries from mechanistic neurophysiological studies 
into evidence-based treatment options with potential for continuous optimization and personalization. Most 
existing treatments for stuttering still use approaches that are purely behavioral in nature and that are applied in 
a relatively generic manner across individuals. Unfortunately, the relapse rate for behavioral treatments for adults 
who stutter has been estimated to be as high as 50-70%. We propose that there is a need for a clinical paradigm 
shift toward efficacious treatments based on contemporary insights from basic neuroscience. This requires, as 
a first step, carefully designed studies that identify key sensorimotor mechanisms that are amenable to realistic 
intervention strategies. For example, interventions ranging from experimental manipulations of the speaker’s 
auditory feedback to pharmacological agents that regulate dopaminergic activity are widely known to induce 
fluent speech, and such effects are supported by an extensive literature spanning several decades. Yet, in real-life clinical practice, the mechanisms of action of these methods are not understood and no progress has been 
made in improving their long-term clinical effects through empirically supported refinement and individualization.
The current proposal is grounded in the premise that reaching the goals for any promising intervention for 
stuttering is facilitated by demonstrating direct effects on neural sensorimotor mechanisms underlying the 
disorder. The data from such studies can then form a much-needed translational link to develop subsequent full-scale clinical trials of the promising intervention. Recent research on the neuroscience of speech production has 
revealed atypical sensorimotor processing in children and adults who stutter (AWS). One set of processes that 
differentiate stuttering and nonstuttering speakers relates to the central nervous system’s reliance on sensory 
predictions for movement planning and execution. In AWS and adults who do not stutter (ANS), we will use 
magnetoencephalography (MEG) imaging after either aripiprazole or placebo to examine the following indicators 
of speech sensorimotor function - pre-speech auditory modulation (PSAM), speaking-induced suppression (SIS) 
and its modulation by speech variability, and centering. These indicators will be studied during unaltered-feedback speech, choral speech, and altered-feedback speech. The outcome of this work will lay the foundation 
for future studies on novel stuttering interventions that use pharmacological agents that regulate dopamine 
uptake either in isolation or in combination with existing behavioral treatments like fluency enhancement with 
auditory feedback manipulations or with future neuromodulation treatments.
Project Summary/Abstract"
10989621,"Project Summary: This proposal outlines a new investigator grant (NIBIB Trailblazer R21) for the PI to develop 
a new holographic platform that enables high-speed, noninvasive 3D chemical imaging with broad biomedical 
applications, including analysis of tumor microenvironment and real-time imaging of live cell cultures/animal 
models/engineered tissues. While nonlinear optical microscopy is an attractive approach because it is label-free, 
nondestructive, and offers higher resolution and richer information than linear microscopy, it usually involves 3D 
scanning that limits the imaging refresh rate. To obviate this bottleneck, recent research has sought to combine 
nonlinear optical microscopy with digital holography to vastly improve imaging speed. However, current 
implementations either lack chemical selectivity or require tuning the laser wavelength in order to measure 
vibrational spectra. To achieve a deeper understanding of biomedical processes at the molecular level, there is 
clearly a significant need to further improve imaging speed and obtain rich spectral information. The long-term 
goal is to develop a new nonlinear digital microscopic holography approach capable of high-speed 3D imaging 
with spectroscopic vibrational contrast: i.e., 5D imaging in spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions, in live cell 
cultures and animal tissues. This transformational tool will enable discoveries of disease mechanisms and new 
treatment paradigms. This application’s objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of a new approach to achieving 
time-domain hyperspectral microscopic holography through vibrationally resonant (VR) sum-frequency 
generation (SFG) and third-order sum-frequency generation (TSFG). Using mid-infrared photons to resonantly 
excite vibrational modes will enable chemical mapping of different functional groups in specimens, while the 
nonlinear processes offer submicron resolution. Combining SFG and TSFG in one instrument will enable 
multimodal probing of non-centrosymmetric sample components as well as other components. Hyperspectral 
holography will enable 3D imaging and simultaneous recovery of the signal field’s amplitude, phase, and spectral 
frequency in a single time scan. Three specific aims will be pursued: Aim 1 is to demonstrate hyperspectral VR-SFG microscopic holography and validate its performance. Based on comparison to the phase-sensitive 
multiplex VR-SFG microscopy previously demonstrated in the applicant’s hands, a single holographic 
interferogram can be measured with a 4-μs exposure time and a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, with further
improvement in signal-to-noise ratio expected. Aim 2 is to demonstrate multimodal VR- SFG/TSFG and to 
accelerate the acquisition rate by ~10x via compressive sensing. Aim 3 is to expand the spectral range to the 
fingerprint region through building a new mid-infrared light source. The approach is innovative because it 
integrates concepts in a new unproven format for imaging with unprecedented speed and vibrational 
spectroscopic contrast. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance 
nonlinear digital microscopic holography for chemical mapping with submicron/subcellular resolutions."
10989436,"Project Summary
Urethral defects requiring urethroplasty occur in children and adults secondary to congenital, traumatic, 
infectious, and malignant conditions. Current tissue sources for urethral replacement are limited by donor site 
morbidity and lack of optimal tissue characteristics to support lifelong voiding and penile erections. A subsequent 
high risk of short- and long-term urethroplasty complications highlights the need for an improved tissue 
alternative with a bioinspired design. The goal of this proposal is to engineer highly elastic, biomimetic, 
three dimensional (3D) bioprinted multi-layered urethral tissue constructs by combining novel bioinks,
made of a human protein and decellularized matrix, with an innovative 3D bioprinting strategy. This
research plan addresses key design requirements: 1) achieving target elasticity by layer in a suturable construct, 
2) incorporating critical biological cues to enhance wound healing and vascularization, and 3) applying a 3D 
bioprinting technique to create optimized properties by layer with a recapitulation of the native urethral layered 
structure. Our overall hypothesis is that these novel 3D bioprinted constructs made from methacrylate human 
recombinant tropoelastin (MeTro), a photocrosslinkable human-based elastomeric hydrogel, and bladder 
decellularized matrix (BAM), that are designed to meet targeted mechanical and 3D structural parameters will 
improve suturability, early urinary tract function, and local tissue regeneration as compared to unseeded scaffold 
urethroplasties. In Aim 1, MeTro and BAM bioinks with mechanical and structural properties that mimic native 
urethral tissue will be engineered. Then, the designed bioinks will be 3D bioprinted to form cell-laden bi-layered
patch constructs containing two primary lower urinary tract cell lines: urothelium and smooth muscle cells. In 
Aim 2, the in vivo efficacy of the engineered cell-laden MeTro/BAM bioprinted constructs, in seeded and 
unseeded configurations, will be applied to a rat patch urethroplasty model, investigating biologic and functional 
outcome parameters. Put together, this research strategy will engineer finely tuned elastic 3D printed biomimetic 
constructs with target mechanical and 3D structural parameters derived from urethral tissue analyses to 
maximize future clinical translatability."
10669586,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain affects nearly 1 in every 5 adults worldwide 1, posing a major public health concern and economic
burden. Yet, despite the widespread prevalence of chronic pain, few effective strategies for long-term pain
management exist. Historically, physicians have relied upon a cocktail of analgesics, including tricyclic
antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and opiates, to treat persistent symptoms in
chronic pain patients 54. However, this approach carries significant risks – reliance upon prescription opioids
has fueled the opioid abuse epidemic that has crippled the United States for the past two decades, and long-
term use of opioids has conversely been shown to increase pain sensitivity over time, necessitating larger and
larger doses to achieve analgesic efficacy 53. Therefore, to successfully combat the opioid epidemic, we must
investigate underlying mechanisms of pain chronification in pursuit of novel, non-addictive pain interventions.
Until recently, much of the pain field has focused on peripheral nervous system and spinal cord circuit
dysfunction, which primarily influence the somatosensory elements of chronic pain. Chronic pain, however, is
more than purely a sensory phenomenon; patients also suffer from the “unpleasantness” or negative valence
associated with pain 22. Recent work from our collaborators has identified a specific ensemble of neurons within
the basolateral amygdala (BLA) that encodes for the negative valence of pain 22. However, it remains unknown
how activity within these nociceptive BLA neurons and the circuits in which they are embedded are altered
post-injury, and whether these changes contribute to pain chronification. Using an innovative activity-based
rabies screen pioneered by our lab 28 in parallel with an unbiased whole-brain c-Fos activity mapping approach,
we can generate a list of input regions to the BLA whose activity is elevated exclusively during chronic pain. To
test the functional contribution of these input circuits in pain chronification, we will perform chemogenetic
inhibition studies in tandem with classical pain assays. By identifying brain-wide, circuit-level changes that
occur post-injury to promote chronic pain, we will elucidate key brain regions and circuit targets that will enable
the development of non-opiate therapies for mitigating chronic pain."

11199664,"The goal of newborn screening (NBS) is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns, thereby providing a window of opportunity for early treatment, often while the child is still asymptomatic.  Such early detection and treatment can have a profound impact on the clinical severity of the condition in the affected child.  If left undiagnosed and untreated, the consequences of the targeted disorders can be dire, many causing irreversible neurological damage; intellectual, developmental, and physical disabilities; and even death.  In 2006, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) developed newborn screening guidelines that recommend that all newborn infants be screened for ""core conditions"" and that secondary conditions identified during the core evaluations be reported.  These recommendations were accepted by the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) (authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000) and by the Secretary of HHS, and formed the basis of the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), which now contains 37 core and 26 secondary conditions with one condition nomination pending Secretary approval.  Most states now use the RUSP or very similar panels for newborn screening. Currently, there are thousands of rare disorders that have been identified and hundreds that could potentially benefit from newborn screening. 
Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the Arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene, resulting in enzyme deficiency and accumulation of sulfatides in the brain, blood, and urine. Its manifestations include progressive cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric decline with peripheral neuropathy and later loss of gross motor milestones, accompanied by characteristic brain MRI findings of destruction of the white matter (demyelination). The birth prevalence of MLD is estimated at 1 in 40,000-100,000 infants, and over 280 disease-associated variants in the ARSA gene have been identified. There are 4 clinical subtypes of MLD based on age of onset of symptoms: late-infantile (<30 months), early-juvenile (2.5-6 years), late-juvenile (>6-16 years), and adults (>16 years). The earlier onset of disease is correlated with more severe loss-of-function variants in the gene, with resulting minimal or no enzyme activity. In addition, 2 alleles in the ARSA gene are associated with pseudodeficiency with reduced enzyme activity that can be confused with the levels in affected individuals.  Recent FDA approval of a gene therapy for MLD has made this condition an attractive one for piloting using the IDIQ contract mechanism. 
The assay developed for MLD is based on biochemical measurement of C16:0 sulfatide in a sample from a dried blood spot using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), with a second-tier test to measure ARSA enzyme activity to reduce false positives.  A third-tier test consists of sequencing the ARSA gene to identify pathogenic mutations and exclude similar disorders due to mutations in the PSAP and SUMF1 genes.  However, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay can be significantly improved by screening for C16:1-OH sulfatide, reducing the false positive rate to ~0.05%. Biochemical and genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis of MLD by ARSA activity in leukocytes, urine sulfatides, and ARSA genotyping are well-established. Reagents and internal standards are commercially available. The ARSA activity in leukocytes and ARSA genotype are expected to predict the age of disease-onset and disease progression for most individuals with a positive screen for MLD.  Thus far, the only prospective population screening pilots have been performed based on testing ~158,000 newborns in Germany and Austria, where 4 infants were identified, and the diagnosis confirmed.  
The purpose of this contract is to support the development, implementation, and provision of proof of concept for the identification of newborns with MLD in the newborn screening setting."

Nestorone gel (progestogen) in addition to testosterone (T) gel (androgen), both applied transdermally, has been shown to suppress gonadotropins and sperm production.  Preliminary results from these studies indicate that a dose of 8 mg of Nestorone gel is required in order to suppress gonadotropins sufficiently to a level that inhibits spermatogenesis.  There are very few contraceptive options available to men.  Studies indicate that men would use a safe and reversible method of contraception if one were available to them.  One promising regimen involves a method of delivering androgen plus progestogen in order to suppress sperm production.  The goal of this study is to conduct a clinical trial to test whether Nestorone and testosterone, both applied transdermally, will be effective for contraception in couples who are willing to use the method as their primary method of contraception.

11064186,"Introduction: The overall goal of our research project is to reduce the mortality and morbidity of children with 
acute and emergency illnesses by improving care during ambulance transportation using telemedicine. In the 
R21 phase, we proved the feasibility of conducting an ambulance-based telemedicine cluster randomized trial. 
Specific Aims for the R33 phase: The R21 phase had three aims, while the R33 phase have the following two 
aims, which remain unchanged from our initial proposal.
- SA 4: To test the efficacy of Ambulance Based Teleconsultation (ABT) by measuring a change in the 
Pediatric Early Warning Signs (PEWS) of acutely ill children from the scene of injury/illness to the 
pediatric emergency department (PED) through a cluster-randomized trial. 
- SA 5: To develop the capacity of local partners in m-health research capacity. 
Methodology: SA4 will be a prospective cluster randomized trial with each ambulance serving as a cluster. We 
will use a stratified random sampling design to assign 30 ambulances to receive the ABT setup, while 30 others 
will serve as control clusters. Our primary outcome will be a change in the Pediatric Early Warning Score from 
the scene of illness/injury to the hospital triage/resuscitation room. Our secondary outcomes will be % of 
completed calls, the satisfaction rate of EMTs and Telemedicine Physicians, and the outcome at the end of the 
ED visit. We will work with our existing partners and use the same telemedicine setup as tested in the R21 phase. 
We will use the SIEHS EMTs who were part of the intervention and control ambulances during the R21 phase to 
work with the research team as trainers for the rest of the service. Our minimum required sample size of 600 
(300 each in intervention and control clusters) remains unchanged. The only change in the data collection 
process will be the incorporation of Emergency Department PEWS in the standard electronic medical record by 
the ChildLife Foundation. This will ensure consistent and timely access to PEWS scores during the trial. As tested 
in the R21 phase, we will store identifiable data in a codebook on a password-protected institutional drive 
accessible to the research team only. After both sets of PEWS have been completed and follow-up consent has 
been received, the data will be de-identified and made accessible for analysis. Concurrently, we will share data 
on outcomes with the currently existing Data Safety Monitoring Board at 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% levels 
of enrollment. Table 1 summarizes the milestones for SA4. 
For SA5, we will build capacity on telemedicine/telehealth research and will further strengthen expertise in 
emergency care clinical trials in Pakistan. This will be achieved through quarterly webinars, two workshops, and 
one national seminar. Additionally, we plan to support the training of SIEHS ambulance in modern prehospital 
care systems through one study visit to a regional or international center of excellence. 
Expected Outcomes: The findings from this research are expected to yield critical safety and efficacy data, 
which will serve to address the shortage of well-trained medical personnel in pediatric emergency care within 
low- and middle-income countries, potentially impacting more than 50% of global pediatric mortality. 
Furthermore, the insights gained from this study can have significant relevance for underserved rural 
communities in high-income countries, such as the United States. Particularly in regions where ambulance 
services heavily rely on the commitment of part-time community volunteers, often operating across extended 
distances."
11169372,"Project Summary/Abstract
A large majority of heritable human traits and diseases are complex, with genetic variants of small effect spread
throughout the genome. It is now understood that genetic contributions to disease are enriched in gene promoters
and enhancers thought to regulate expression. This has led to the hypothesis that genetic variation leads to
disease via disruption of an underlying gene regulatory network, either via trait-relevant pathways or distal
perturbations propagating through the network to trait-specific core genes. At present, our lack of understanding
of the networks themselves limits our ability to understand how their disruption can lead to disease state. In the
long-term, causal models of these networks may reveal avenues for treatment by suggesting mechanisms for
returning the system to proper functioning. Here, I propose to leverage recent developments in causal inference to
show that novel computational methods enable integration across large-scale data generation efforts to highlight
regulatory changes underlying common disease. I propose to i) improve causal structure learning methods to
better leverage prior biological knowledge and improve network estimation for genes that are lowly expressed,
poorly captured or difficult to intervene on experimentally and ii) construct a causal network integrating populationscale eQTL data and GWAS summary statistics, and conduct a thorough comparative analysis with large-scale
CRISPR perturbation data in immortalized cell lines. The first aim will enable us to construct genome-wide causal
networks using single cell CRISPR screen data, including many functionally-relevant genes that are difficult to
capture using existing methods. Our second aim will enable identification of core disease-relevant genes and
their pathways, and allow us to identify which traits and disease pathways are best studied by current in vitro
immortalized cell line models. Completion of these aims will provide a framework for large-scale estimation of
regulatory networks and their role in complex trait biology."

The broad, long-term goal of the Data and Life Sciences Core (DLSC) within the Nebraska Center for Integrated 
Biomolecular Communication (CIBC) is to serve as a critical, sustainable resource for biomedical data science 
and data management expertise, service, and education at the University of Nebraska. The research performed 
by CIBC investigators will continue to result in the creation of large, complex data sets, particularly for those 
researchers with projects involving high-throughput biological data and molecular biology data. Proper 
experimental design, data generation, and subsequent analyses of these data sets requires analytical and 
computational expertise, access to scientific equipment and relevant technical expertise, high-throughput 
computing, and resources for data management. Coordinated access to such services is often cost prohibitive 
and nonintuitive for individual laboratories. Another obstacle faced by many biomedical researchers, including 
those affiliated with CIBC, is the timely and comprehensive sharing of research data and research findings with 
collaborators, stakeholders, and the public. To address these issues, CIBC will continue to support DLSC. DLSC 
provides hardware, software, and expertise in experimental design, bioinformatics, computational biology, 
statistics, computer science, data management, and advanced cyberinfrastructure to CIBC investigators and the 
wider university community. To date, DLSC has launched a web portal for data transfer, hosting, and sharing 
through Globus and the University of Nebraska’s Holland Computing Center; initiated collaborations with CIBC 
researchers leading to presentations and publications; provided access to analytical software; and hosted 
training and workforce development opportunities. The immediate goal of DLSC for Phase 2 is to expand and 
strengthen the core’s data science and data management infrastructure, services, expertise, and educational 
programming in support of CIBC investigators and the Center’s overall goals and long-term sustainability. This 
will be achieved through four aims: 1) expand an existing computational platform for data storage, analysis, and 
management to include support for biomolecular imaging experiments and integration with the Research Space 
platform, 2) promote core sustainability by initiating collaborations with personnel across the University of 
Nebraska campuses to enable complex, interdisciplinary biomedical projects that require expertise in data 
science and data management, 3) serve a critical, sustainable role in CIBC research by collaborating on CIBC 
projects, both as authors on research publications relevant to CIBC and as investigators on subsequent 
proposals for internal and external research funding, and 4) educate CIBC members about the role of data 
science in chemical and biochemical research, the potential and caveats of experimental data, and start-of-the- 
art resources and pipelines for data preprocessing and analysis. DSLC will continue to capitalize on existing 
expertise at the University of Nebraska, hire needed expertise, and build long-term core sustainability."
10758559,"Project Summary/Abstract
Current multiple sclerosis (MS) therapeutic approaches are insufficient to maintain long-term immune
homeostasis and effectively recalibrate T helper cell imbalances in patients. There remains an unmet clinical
need for new strategies that restore and sustain immune tolerance in MS.
PD1 signaling plays a critical role in the maintenance of immune tolerance
. Altered PDL1/PD1 expression, and/or
blockade of PD1 signaling, results in the breakdown of immune tolerance and predisposes mice and humans to
the development of autoimmunity and tissue inflammation. For example, blockade of PD1 and its ligands can
exacerbate EAE, a mouse model of MS. In fact, we recently found that Smad7, a major molecule implicated in
autoimmunity, sustains intestinal and CNS inflammation in mice by limiting PD1 in T cells and PD1 ligands in
DCs, thereby dampening PD1-induced Tregs. Given the critical role of PD1 signaling in limiting tissue
inflammation and autoimmunity, PD1 could represent a therapeutic target of high clinical interest in MS.
However,
the impact of enhancing PD1 signaling for therapeutic benefit in EAE and MS has never been tested.
For this proposal, we began exploring PD1 agonists in human T cells. We found agonizing PD1 via
immunoglobulin fusion proteins PDL1-Fc or PDL2-Fc promotes de novo human Treg induction and limits Treg
plasticity. Interestingly, we also found that agonizing PD1 within myeloid cells inhibits inflammatory cytokines
that are known to promote Th1/17 development and destabilize Tregs in MS and EAE. Therefore, we will test
our hypothesis that PD1 agonist monotherapy could effectively restore immune tolerance by directly enhancing
Treg homeostasis while quenching effector T cell responses in EAE and MS. Based on our exciting preliminary
finding that IL-2 directly induces PD1 in CD4+ T cells and that combining low-dose IL-2 with PD1 agonists
synergistically boosts human Treg induction,
we will also investigate if combining low-dose IL-2 with PDL1/2-Fc
will synergistically boost MS patient Treg responses.
Because IL-2 can still promote effector T cell responses,
combining PD1 agonist with low-dose IL-2 may also restrain any undesired direct effect of low-dose IL-2 on
boosting effector T cells. In addition, PD1 agonist might further complement low-dose IL-2 by targeting other
important cell types unaffected by IL-2 (e.g. myeloid cells). In Aim 1, we will test the translational relevance of
PD1 agonism monotherapy by treating MS patient immune cells in vitro, and by treating humanized PD1 knock-
in mice with EAE in vivo. In Aim 2, we will test PDL1/2-Fc and low-dose IL-2 combination therapy by treating
MS patient immune cells in vitro, and by treating humanized PD1/IL-2 receptor alpha (RA) double knock-in mice
with EAE in vivo, including single-cell RNA sequencing of immune responses in treated mice. In summary, we
will explore the efficacy of a never tested PD1 agonist/low-dose IL-2 combination therapy strategy in EAE and
MS to
address unanswered questions around how PD1 agonism promotes human immune tolerance, the
translational potential of PD1 agonist therapeutic strategies, and how to implement them in CNS autoimmunity."
10758280,"SUMMARY
There is a long-standing quest to better understand what causes our bones to break, especially as a devastating
and widespread consequence of osteoporosis. Beyond assessment of bone quantity (e.g., bone mineral density),
it is well-know that tissue-level quality plays a key role in determining bone strength and fragility. We and others
have shown that microscale tissue composition is intrinsically related to skeletal diseases; however, a limitation
of this approach is that it cannot capture features of the nanoscale building blocks of bone quality and integrity
(mineralized collagen fibrils and bundles on the order of 500 nm). Thus, analysis of bone composition at high
spatial resolution is needed to elucidate the nanoscale origins of impaired bone health. Additionally, there is a
paucity of research into the combined role of compositional properties in bone tissue quality, which is essential
to reveal the multifactorial nature underlying poor bone features in osteoporosis. To address these critical gaps
in knowledge, we aim to apply innovative approaches to enlighten the multifactorial relationship between
bone nanoscale composition and reduced bone tissue quality in osteoporosis. We hypothesize that
nanoscale compositional properties of bone are significant correlates to predict histological diagnosis and bone
morphologic features associated with osteoporosis. In Aim 1, we propose to determine and quantify nanoscale
compositional properties of healthy and osteoporotic bones. Readily available clinical bone biopsies will first be
evaluated for standard histopathological diagnosis, as well as by micro-computed tomography (microCT) of bone
morphometry. The samples will then be assessed by state-of-the-art optical photothermal infrared (O-PTIR)
spectroscopy and imaging, which allows breakthrough analysis of intact tissue composition at 500 nm spatial
resolution. Our supportive preliminary data show the acquisition and quantification of diverse bone nanoscale
compositional properties of mineral and collagen within individual osteon and trabeculae. Additionally, mineral
stoichiometry will be determined by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(SEM-EDX). With this rich dataset, we will perform a comprehensive analysis of comparisons and correlations
among bone features in healthy and osteoporotic bones to identify relevant nanoscale compositional properties
associated with typical osteoporotic bone quality. In Aim 2, we propose to apply machine learning methods to
elucidate the multifactorial relationship between bone nanoscale composition and osteoporosis. The goal will be
to predict histopathological diagnosis and morphometric features of normal and osteoporotic bones based on
input of combined nanoscale compositional properties. We will initially apply multivariable partial least square
(PLS) cross-validation, then focus on cutting-edge deep learning methods. This innovative approach will break
new ground towards elucidating which bone nanoscale compositional properties underlie poor bone quality in
osteoporosis and will inform future clinical studies into new therapeutic tissue targets to improve bone health."
10767772,"Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a serious blood cancer that affects United
States Veterans and other individuals. Multiple studies have demonstrated that active
signaling pathways are a necessary step to leukemic cell transformation. However, the
mechanism(s) of activated signaling in FLT3 wild type AML are poorly described. We
hypothesize that constitutive activation of the PI3 kinase pathway leads to activation of a
complex called mammalian target of rapamycin 2 (mTORC2) which regulates diverse
pathways to balance cell growth and survival in AML cells. In this proposal, we will
define these signaling pathways and determine if inhibition of mTORC2 alone or in
combination with other drugs will enhance survival in pre-clinical models of AML
leading to new therapies for this challenging disease.
1. Objective(s): The overall objective of the research proposal is to define the
mechanisms of activated cell signaling in AML cells, determine the biochemical
pathways regulated by mTORC2 in AML cells and determine if inhibition of mTORC2
in pre-clinical models can increase survival of individuals with AML.
2. Research Design: We propose three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1) Confirm that
4EBP1 is a target of MTORC2 and not MTORC1 in human AML samples and define
whether MTORC2 regulates cell survival or cell growth. Specific Aim 2) Determine if
mTORC2 Regulates FOXO 3 phosphorylation in AML cells to Regulate Cell Survival.
Specific Aim 3) Determine if combinatorial MTORC1/MTORC2 inhibition in
combination with chemotherapy or Bcl2 inhibition suppresses AML cell growth in pre-
clinical models.
3. Methodology: Specific Aim 1 will primary use human AML cells and primary
human AML cells in culture. Specific Aim 2 will use similar methods but also assess
FOXO binding to DNA using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Specific Aim 3 will focus
on studies in a xenotransplantation model of AML developed by our laboratory.
4. Findings: We anticipate confirming that mTORC2 is actually a master regulator of
signaling in AML cells. In particular, we anticipate that mTORC2 regulates 4EBP1 to
regulate protein translation. We also anticipate that mTORC2 regulates FOXO proteins to
regulate c-Myc expression. Finally, we anticipate that mTORC2 inhibition will work
alone or in combination with other therapies to inhibit AML cell survival in vivo.
5. Clinical Relationships: These studies will use primary material from patients with
AML and will be used to develop a new approach to therapy of the disease."

Significance. Over 726,000 individuals in the U.S. have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with about 87% of
patients on dialysis, a life-sustaining treatment. Dialysis patients experience accelerated mortality and frequent
hospitalizations (twice per year). These adverse outcomes are exacerbated at key time periods after transition
to dialysis and show significant spatial variation across U.S. Our overarching goal is to identify modifiable
patient, dialysis facility and region-level (spatial) risk factors and critical time periods for elevated
hospitalization risk and mortality to guide patient care strategies. To reach this goal, we propose novel
multilevel time-dynamic models applied to data from the national database, United States Renal Data System
(USRDS), which contains data on nearly all patients on dialysis in the U.S. We consider three-level longitudinal
data with longitudinal outcomes nested in patients, patients nested in dialysis facilities and facilities nested in
geographic regions across U.S. The proposals include linking of multiple data domains to study effects from
time periods prior to (prelude) and after (vintage) transition to dialysis and accommodate time varying effects of
multilevel risk factors at the patient-, facility- and region-levels.
Aims and Innovation. We propose three specific aims: Aim 1) To develop and apply multilevel spatiotemporal
functional models (MST-FMs) of hospitalization and mortality rates. Initial efforts for identifying spatial “hot
spots” with higher hospitalization and mortality rates have been largely descriptive. In addition, these
approaches do not consider the critical temporal variation across time after transition to dialysis. We will
develop estimation and inference procedures to model the spatially nested functional data of facility-level
hospitalization and mortality rates for constructing spatiotemporal maps, identifying hot spot regions and post
dialysis transition time periods of elevated hospitalization and mortality risk in the dialysis population for the
first time. Aim 2) To develop and apply multilevel time-varying joint models (MT-JMs) of longitudinal
hospitalizations and survival outcomes at the patient-level. The proposed MT-JMs will incorporate functional
predictors from the prelude period, time-varying effects of both cross-sectional and time-dependent multilevel
covariates as well as multilevel random effects. To date, joint modeling approaches mostly consider one-level
hierarchies encompassing longitudinal outcome observed for a set of subjects, with only a few works
considering a two-level hierarchy, intended for modeling time-static (fixed) covariate effects. The proposed MT-
JMs address the need for flexible modeling features (to assess prelude data, monthly clinical longitudinal data
post-transition, multilevel time-varying effects etc.), incorporation of three-level multilevel data structure, and
scalability to complex large datasets. Aim 3) To characterize the operational performance of MST-FMs and
MT-JMs in simulation, independent validation, and comparative studies. Model assessment and prediction
validation will be based on independent prospective validation cohorts of incident dialysis patients."
10788302,"Project Summary
The healthy skeleton continuously renews itself throughout the lifespan via closely coupled bone resorption
and remodeling-based bone formation. In contrast, modeling-based bone formation, i.e., de novo bone
formation without prior activation of bone resorption, is less commonly found in the adult skeleton, but has
been identified as an important mechanism by which anabolic agents for osteoporosis, e.g., intermittent
parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH related peptide (PTHrP), and sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab), rapidly elicit
new bone formation. By developing a novel imaging platform that enables reliable identification of MBF and
RBF and subsequent tissue-level mechanical testing in adult rat bone, we discovered that MBF responds
faster than RBF to anabolic treatments. Moreover, bone tissue resulting from MBF has a greater resistance to
anabolic treatment withdrawal-induced bone loss and increased heterogeneity of elastic modulus compared to
pre-existing bone and bone tissue resulting from RBF. These exciting preliminary data provide a strong
scientific premise to support our central hypothesis that MBF is a highly efficient regenerative mechanism that
leads to sustainable therapeutic benefits on bone tissue quantity and quality, and whole bone strength.
Furthermore, our data suggest that, upon early withdrawal from anabolic treatment, ongoing bone formation
continues at MBF sites, forming an “anabolic window” that retains the treatment effect; In contrast, the majority
of bone tissue formed at RBF sites were resorbed following treatment withdrawal. Therefore, we propose that a
cyclic and sequential treatment regimen with alternating anabolic and anti-resorptive treatments will lead to
increased mineral deposition and number of MBF, improved retention of bone tissue at RBF and quiescent
bone surface, and improved tissue heterogeneity and whole bone strength. The overall objective of this study
is to elucidate the cellular mechanisms (Aim 1a) and mechanical consequences (Aim 2a) of MBF and RBF,
and to evaluate the new treatment regimen which leverages MBF to improve and extend treatment efficacy
(Aim 2a and 2b) using a rat model. By combining our innovative imaging and image analyses with tissue-level
mechanical testing approaches, this proposed research project will fill the critical knowledge gap of long-term
mechanical consequences of bone tissue formed through MBF and RBF, and provide important insight for the
clinical design and optimization of treatment strategies that modulate MBF, a highly efficient but often
overlooked regenerative mechanism."
10781900,"1) Background and key gaps in our understanding. Cellular force generation drives processes vital for
eukaryotic life, including cell division, cell migration, and muscle contraction. Thus, the basic principles underlying
cellular force generation are central to both developmental biology and the progression of force-dependent
diseases like cancer. Cells generate force by assembling cellular contractile systems. Contractile systems
emerge from the collective action of individual components within a larger molecular assembly. Our first
investigation into cellular contractile systems focused on the class of molecular motors responsible for generating
contractile forces, myosin II. The force-generating form of myosin II is a filament. A given myosin II filament can
contain multiple, distinct myosin II paralogs (i.e., hetero-filaments), wherein each individual myosin II paralog has
unique biophysical properties. Previously, the specific function(s) of myosin II-containing hetero-filaments within
contractile systems was unknown. Our work during the ESI MIRA funding period has revealed multiple roles for
hetero-filaments in the context of cell division and muscle contraction. Future work should address how hetero-
filaments are regulated, influence mechanical output, and cooperate with other contractile system components.
2) Description of recent progress by the PI. In non-muscle cells, we reported that hetero-filaments serve
multiple functions. Myosin IIA filaments seed the formation of myosin IIB filaments in both interphase and
mitosis/cytokinesis (Fenix et al. 2016, Taneja et al., 2020). The presence of myosin IIA in hetero-filaments drives
cortex tension (Taneja et al. 2020) and is regulated by both myosin IIA turnover and by phosphorylation of the
myosin IIA regulatory light chain (Taneja and Burnette 2019, Taneja et al. 2021). Meanwhile, the presence of
myosin IIB in hetero-filaments stabilizes the cell cortex during mitosis/cytokinesis and regulates cytokinetic
fidelity through multiple mechanisms (Taneja et al. 2020). Within cardiac muscle cells, we reported that
NMIIA/NMIIB hetero-filaments seed filaments of the muscle-specific myosin paralog, β myosin II, and are found
exclusively in the sarcomere precursors known as muscle stress fibers. We also experimentally demonstrated
that muscle stress fibers directly give rise to sarcomeres (Fenix et al. 2018, Taneja, Neininger et al. 2020). 3)
Overview of future research program. Here, we propose to build upon our findings from the ESI MIRA by
taking a multi-faceted approach aimed at three areas: A) We will continue elucidating how specific molecular
components of myosin II filaments, as well as those of other contractile system proteins like α-actinin and formins,
regulate cellular force production. B) We will determine the roles, and specific differences in function, of the non-
muscle and muscle paralogs of myosin II, α-actinin, and potentially other sarcomeric proteins during both
sarcomere formation and mitosis/cytokinesis (we have found that some muscle paralogs re-localize from the
sarcomere to the cortex during cell division). C) Finally, we will use zebrafish embryos to test the hypotheses
that come out of our in vitro experiments in vivo."
10734775,"Kingella kingae is an invasive gram-negative pathogen that has been recognized recently as a leading cause
of bone and joint infections in young children, accounting for up to 88% of osteoarticular cases in children <4
years old. In addition, K. kingae is an important cause of invasive bloodstream infections in young children.
Complications of osteoarticular infections in children include abnormalities in bone growth, limitation of joint
mobility, unstable joint articulation, and chronic joint dislocation, resulting in residual skeletal dysfunction in 10-
25% of cases. Complications of invasive bloodstream infections include multi-organ injury and mortality.
Approximately 25% of K. kingae isolates possess β-lactamase activity, and many of these isolates are
resistant to other antibiotics as well, raising concern about approaches to treatment in the future. At present
there are no effective strategies to prevent K. kingae disease and the associated morbidity. The pathogenesis
of K. kingae disease begins with colonization of the oropharynx, followed by invasion of the bloodstream and
spread to bones, joints, and other sites. We have established that isolates of K. kingae produce an
exopolysaccharide that is encoded by the pamABCDE locus, is a homopolymer of galactofuranose, is secreted
from the organism, and is a critical virulence factor essential for full virulence. We have found that there are 2
distinct exopolysaccharide structures, distinguished by the linkage of the galactofuranose repeating subunit
and referred to as type 1 and type 2. Importantly, the exopolysaccharide promotes resistance to serum-
mediated killing and neutrophil phagocytosis and thereby promotes K. kingae survival in the bloodstream,
indicating that at least some of the exopolysaccharide is anchored to the bacterial surface. Preliminary results
indicate that pooled serum from healthy adults and convalescent serum samples from children with invasive K.
kingae disease contain antibodies against the exopolysaccharide. In this proposal, we will elucidate the
mechanism by which the type 1 and type 2 exopolysaccharides are synthesized and anchored to the bacterial
surface. In addition, we will elucidate the pathogenic properties of the type 1 and type 2 exopolysaccharides.
We will also elucidate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the exopolysaccharides. The proposed
studies will provide fundamental insight into K. kingae pathogenicity and basic aspects of bacterial
exopolysaccharides. These studies will also facilitate development of a K. kingae vaccine and antibody-based
therapeutics against other pathogens with galactofuranose-containing surface structures."

and some subgroups of Hispanic women also have increased risk. Racism has been hypothesized as a root
cause of perinatal health inequities in the United States (U.S.), yet its mechanisms remain understudied.
Epigenetics is a field with great promise for understanding how racism affects gene expression and identifying
risk for adverse birth outcomes among women of color. Most studies of epigenomics in pregnancy have had
low representation of NH Black and Hispanic women, and few have included structural racism exposures.
Further, prospective analyses from early pregnancy to birth outcomes are lacking, limiting identification of high-
risk women for improved prenatal surveillance. We propose to address these crucial knowledge gaps by
leveraging one of the largest and best-phenotyped cohorts to date, the nuMoM2b Study (2010-2015), a
multicenter, longitudinal cohort study of nulliparous pregnant women across the U.S. Existing data from this
study include: extracted maternal DNA from blood, Krieger’s individual experiences of discrimination,
geocoded participant addresses, pregnancy complications, and birth outcomes. We have assembled a
multidisciplinary team with expertise in maternal stress, epigenomics, and perinatal health inequities to
complete three aims. Aim 1: Determine the interactive effects of individual- and structural- level racism on PTB
among NH Black, Hispanic, and NH White participants (n=8,681). We will use the experiences of
discrimination scale score for individual level racism, and derive six measures of structural racism: residential
segregation, income, immigrant political climate, political participation, judicial treatment, and homeownership.
We will study within-racial and ethnic group differences in PTB; and then examine multilevel (the interaction of
individual and structural) racism in the whole group to determine if racism explains the excess PTB observed in
NH Black and Hispanic women. Aim 2: Characterize the methylome of all NH Black women in the cohort
(n=1,306). We will conduct an epigenome-wide association study of early pregnancy and study candidate
genes on stress pathways leading to PTB. Aim 3: Identify whether DNA methylation mediates the association
between multilevel racism and PTB among NH Black women (n=1,306). Aims 2 and 3 focus on NH Black
women as they bear the highest burden of PTB. This study will be the largest to examine multilevel racism
factors and epigenomics in pregnancy among NH Black women. Findings will address knowledge gaps by 1)
contributing epigenomic data towards discovery of mechanisms underlying PTB and other adverse birth
outcomes in Black women; and 2) informing health policy development related to racism and perinatal health

10843761,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease is a leading cause of death in the U.S., and its prevalence is expected to climb from nearly
6 million today to 13 million Americans by 2050. Sleep disruption is known to be a risk factor for age-associated
cognitive decline and for the development of Alzheimer's disease. Efforts to understand the connections between
sleep and Alzheimer's disease have focused on key neuroprotective aspects of slow wave sleep, including its
role in memory processing via regulation of synaptic remodeling and restoration of synaptic homeostasis. A
critical process in sleep's memory functions is a form of memory replay, during which sequences of neuronal
activity repeat and reproduce patterns that mirror the wake state of memory. My research team has focused on
the identification of the neuronal communication elements that constitute memory replay, and several of these
elements are observable from simple surface electroencephalography (EEG). Slow waves, theta bursts, and
sleep spindles mark the timing of memory replay cycles, and understanding their role in cognitive aging and
Alzheimer's disease may offer a novel method to detect and/or predict neurodegenerative disease, as well as
provide a target for efforts to restore the neuroprotective properties of sleep. Our preliminary results suggest that
changes in theta bursts are associated with cognitive decline among aging adults and may also predict future
decline. My overall goal is to fill knowledge gaps in the connections between memory replay of sleep and
Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis to help guide the development of novel diagnostics and interventional
approaches for Alzheimer's disease. My overarching hypothesis is that changes in theta burst EEG power are
associated with cognitive decline among aging adults. My research objectives are to determine the relationships
between theta burst EEG power and cognitive changes in the context of age-associated cognitive decline as the
basis for future biomarker development and causation/mechanistic studies in early Alzheimer's disease. I will
accomplish these objectives by pursuing the following Specific Aims: Aim 1a) Determine whether changes in
theta burst power occur in aging adults who experience cognitive decline, Aim 1b) Determine whether changes
in cognitive scores and baseline theta burst power among aging adults serve as an effective predictor of future
cognitive decline, and Aim 2) Determine the contribution of theta burst size and theta burst temporal alignment
to the reductions in observed theta burst EEG power. My proposed experiments are innovative because they
are the first to examine the relationships between theta burst changes and cognitive aging. My proposal is
significant because it will further our understanding of the neuroprotective properties of sleep and will advance
a clinical tool that may measure the integrity of critical neuronal functions as a biomarker and treatment target."

Bacterial antibiotic resistance is a major global health threat. Our proposal aims to develop
immunotherapies focused on the surface glycans of bacteria as a potential paradigm shift in the
fight against life-threatening bacteria, for which current therapeutic options are limited. We aim to
develop novel antibody-based vaccines and antibody therapeutics to help meet the evolving
challenge presented by these bacteria. In particular, the grant will focus on developing and
characterizing antibodies and MHC class II to four classes of glycans and glycopeptides from the
capsular antigens, peptidoglycans, teichoic acids and O-linked glycans from three organisms:
Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), and Neisseria gonorrhea (Ng). The
glycan antigens will be presented to the immune system linked to peptides and conjugated to
chemically defined sites on virus-like particles.
The Structural Biology Core 3 will utilize high-throughput x-ray crystallography with state-of-the
art tools, instrumentation and facilities to structurally and biophysically characterize the elicited
antibodies in complex with the glycans used for immunization. In addition, we will examine
complexes of MHC Class II molecules with designed glycopeptides to explore how these unique
structures are presented to T cells. Our structural results will be used to guide iterative rounds of
modifications to the antigens, linkers and peptides with Projects 1-4 and Cores 1,2 to focus and

are critical determinants of intra-tumor heterogeneity, tumor propagation, therapeutic resistance, and recurrence
following treatment. This project entitled Molecular determinants of cellular heterogeneity and therapeutic
resistance in GBM brings together a cross-disciplinary team of experts using state-of-the art GBM cell models,
single-cell genomics, and innovative gene-delivery technology to understand how GSC-driving mechanisms
contribute to the generation of tumor-propagating and therapy resistant cells in GBM with the goal of defining
novel therapeutic targets. Aim 1 of this proposal will seek to determine how stem-cell driving mechanisms
induce therapy resistant GSCs. Mechanistically, we will test the hypothesis that Oct4 and Sox2 drive/maintain
a therapy-resistant phenotype in GSCs by activating TGFBR2 expression and function via an
Oct4/Sox2:ELF3:TGFBR2 axis. As a mid-term strategy to dissect the molecular mechanism driving therapy-
resistance in GBM we will combine our validated cell systems and the state-of-the-art 10x Genomics Chromium
pipeline to interrogate the transcriptome and chromatin state of patient-derived glioma cell lines their therapy-
resistant counterparts at the single cell level. Aim 2 of this proposal will focus on developing novel molecular
agents that target therapy-resistant GBM cell populations. We will build on the positive momentum of our
recent novel developments in miRNA-based therapeutics to design molecular approaches to better inhibit tumor
growth, prevent emergence of therapy-resistant cell subpopulations, and sensitize therapy-resistant cells to
chemo/radiation in human xenograft models of GBM. Our preliminary data shows that miR-149-3p can inhibit 8
putative oncogenes simultaneously whose coordinate action drive tumor maintenance and therapeutic
resistance. Aim 2.1 of this proposal will explore the mechanistic contribution of miR-149-3p to the therapy-
resistant phenotype of GSCs. Aim 2.2 will investigate the pre-clinical translatability of our new-found concepts
by testing novel combinations of miRNAs to more effectively normalize oncogenic networks dysregulated by
stem-cell driving mechanisms in GBM. Completion of this study will: (i) Define the cell sub-populations capable
of tumor propagation; (ii) define cell populations capable of transitioning to a therapy-resistant state; (iii)
determine transcriptomic and chromatin changes associated with these cell populations that are amenable to
therapeutic targeting; (iv) provide novel rational pre-clinical therapeutics to potentially treat recurrent GBM.
Completion of this project will provide a roadmap to both understanding and more effectively treating resistant
GBM, hence improving patient outcomes and saving lives."

 The overall objective of Project 01 is to improve our ability to identify genetic factors relevant to OSA by
studying upper airway anatomy and OSA extreme phenotypes. There are known anatomic risk factors (reduced
craniofacial skeleton and enlarged soft tissue structures, including tongue fat) for OSA that have been shown to
be heritable. We postulate that certain OSA genetic risk variants operate via changes in anatomy, leading to
heterogeneous and extreme OSA. A foundational aspect of this hypothesis is that studying genetic associations
with intermediate anatomical phenotypes known to cause OSA will facilitate identification of genetic factors in
the presence of heterogeneous etiologies. To address the overarching hypothesis, we have three Specific Aims.
In Aim 1 we apply automatic, large-scale, high-throughput and advanced machine-learning techniques to
clinically-obtained MR (magnetic resonance) and CT (computed tomography) images of the head and neck to
quantify upper airway anatomical risk factors for OSA in patients with linked biobank data. Using these
phenotypes, we will then perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify variants related to
anatomy which, in turn, are expected to influence risk for OSA. These data will be used to generate enhanced
polygenic risk scores for OSA that incorporate genetic predictors of anatomic risk factors (e.g., tongue fat,
mandibular length). In Aim 2 we will perform in silico analyses of genetic loci to identify core biological
mechanisms and prioritize likely causal variants and genes underlying association signals. These analyses will
provide insights into the significance of GWAS loci and be directly complemented by downstream analyses in
cell-based and model systems being performed in Project 04. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use an extreme phenotype
design to identify novel anatomical associations and rare genetic variants in genes prioritized in Aims 1-2, which
will be utilized to further enhance polygenic risk scores and understanding of disease mechanisms. This proposal
has a very strong investigative team, with expertise in both OSA anatomy and genetic analysis, and uses
innovative strategies including deep anatomic phenotyping, novel machine learning algorithms, and cutting-edge
analysis approaches for identifying and interrogating OSA-susceptibility loci. Findings from this proposal will
result in a greater understanding of the impact of genetics and upper airway anatomy on OSA heterogeneity, the
downstream clinical impact of these genomic alterations, and their biological underpinnings. This deep dive into
the genetic underpinnings of quantitative anatomic intermediate traits for OSA will significantly move the field
forward by connecting genetic variation to biological mechanisms, enhance the development of polygenic risk
scores that have wide-ranging applications from early detection and treatment to screening and case
identification of OSA in the electronic medical record. In combination with other Projects in this Program, results
are expected to facilitate translation of GWAS to more personalized and precise clinical care."

 Identification of biomarkers of the severity of sleep-related conditions and the effectiveness of therapies was
recently presented as the number one critical opportunity in the 2021 Sleep Research Plan from the National
Institutes of Health and National Center on Sleep Disorders Research (NCSDR). While obstructive sleep apnea
(OSA) is common, there are limited biomarkers for identification and management of the condition. Specific use
cases for an OSA biomarker include: (i) improving case identification, (ii) monitoring efficacy of therapy, and (iii)
providing prognostic value with respect to who will get particular consequences or how individuals respond to
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. While different approaches can be used to define
biomarkers, this project will focus on microRNAs, which have very recently been shown to be promising
biomarkers in OSA. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that alter the translation of protein coding RNA.
Their expression is dynamic and altered by many challenges, such as hypoxia. Expression of all microRNAs in
blood can be assessed by sequencing all short RNAs. Prior studies, albeit with small sample sizes, suggest
differences in microRNA expression between OSA cases and controls and that differences in microRNA
expression can identify individuals with OSA who will show larger blood pressure responses to CPAP treatment.
Using complementary sequencing approaches and clinically-feasible quantitative PCR (qPCR), we propose to
validate and extend these initial observations. First, we will seek biomarkers that are specific to OSA by
evaluating differences in microRNA profiles between cases with OSA and controls without OSA matched for age,
sex, and body mass index and without other underlying conditions that could independently affect microRNA
expression. While identifying microRNAs specific to OSA is important, it is also useful to determine microRNAs
useful for improving OSA case identification beyond known clinical risk factors. Thus, this project will enroll a
larger case-control sample with minimal exclusion criteria in which to assess the predictive value of differences
in microRNA expression. To understand the utility of microRNAs as treatment-related biomarkers, cases with
OSA will be studied before and after 6 months of CPAP. We anticipate that some microRNAs specific to OSA
will normalize with CPAP treatment, thus providing an objective measure of effectiveness. In all OSA cases, we
will assess 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure to validate and extend recent reports of a microRNA signature
that predicts blood pressure response to CPAP. We will conduct robust validation for all biomarkers. First, using
the same samples sequenced in discovery analyses, we will perform analytical validation via clinically-feasible
qPCR techniques. Independent validation of microRNA signatures will be done in new samples, including cases
and controls from Project 01. Moreover, the relative utility of microRNAs and other signatures developed in the
Program, such as polygenic risk scores, will be assessed. Overall, this Project is directly aligned with the stated
research objectives of the NCSDR and the specific goals of this Program Project."
10843728,"ABSTRACT Project 1: Exercise-Induced Hypoalgesia
The overarching objective of this project is to examine the neurobiological mechanisms related to and impact of
impaired exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) in people with knee osteoarthritis (OA). While physical activity,
including structured exercise, is the first line intervention for people with chronic pain due to knee OA, over half
of people do not respond to exercise interventions. Some people with knee OA have an abnormal acute response
to exercise characterized by worsened or no change in pain sensitivity, i.e., an impaired EIH response. Impaired
EIH may serve as a risk factor for negative response to first-line treatments involving physical activity and
exercise, inadvertently exacerbating pain acutely. Whether this impaired EIH is related to previously
characterized pain-related nervous system dysfunction in people with chronic pain is not known. Specifically,
dysfunction of ascending pain facilitation or descending pain inhibition, heightened generalized nervous system
sensitivity assessed self-reported multisensory sensitivity, and altered autonomic nervous system functioning
assessed as low heart rate variability will be examined as potential factors related to impaired EIH. It is also not
known whether impaired EIH represents the biological underpinnings of key physical (movement-evoked pain,
muscle weakness, impaired physical function, limited physical activity) and psychological (fear of movement,
negative beliefs about exercise) impairments seen in people with knee OA. This project will leverage the next
cycle of the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study to comprehensively examine the degree of impaired EIH in
a cohort of adults with or at risk of knee OA, the inter-relations between nervous system dysfunction and impaired
EIH, and their impacts on key physical and psychological outcomes. The first aim of this project is to determine
the relation of nervous system dysfunction, i.e., abnormalities in ascending pain facilitation and descending pain
inhibition, elevated multisensory sensitivity, and low heart rate variability to degree of EIH. The second aim is to
examine relation of EIH to movement-evoked pain, quadriceps strength, and physical function. The third aim is
to evaluate the relation of EIH to fear of movement, beliefs and outcome expectations related to exercise, and
daily physical activity. This project addresses several knowledge gaps about impaired EIH in knee OA, the most
common form of arthritis and leading cause of disability worldwide. We will obtain novel insights into the relations
of EIH with several hypothesized associated mechanisms or markers and key knee OA outcomes. Alternate first-
line therapies may need to be considered for those with impaired EIH, whereas those with strong EIH responses
may respond better to exercise interventions. Novel treatment avenues can be tested if the underlying nervous
system impairments are found to contribute to impaired EIH. We will also shed new light on the common
observation of movement-evoked pain and poor response to first-line exercise management options in people
with knee OA, ultimately facilitating future studies of new targeted approaches to knee OA management."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects 5.8 million people in the United States and is an immense burden on our
economy, patients and caregivers. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully led to 25
genome-wide significant loci associated with AD risk and many more associations with key clinical covariates.
Most of these findings are made on participants with European ancestry, although efforts to study other
minority populations are taking off. Knowledge about AD genetics among Asian Americans is especially limited
due to lack of participants. Comprising 6% of the US populace, Asian Americans are under-sampled and
deserve more scientific investment.
We propose the Asian Cohort for Alzheimer’s Disease (ACAD), the first large Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
genetics cohort for Asians in United States (US) and Canada. To address recruitment barriers, we assembled
a team of scientists, clinicians, and community partners with collaborative history and expertise in AD research,
human genetics, and Asian community outreach. We propose to recruit 5,081 participants aged 60 years or
older and of Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese ancestry from metropolitan areas across US and Canada in
collaboration with community health providers or long-term care facilities that serve Asian communities. We
will collect DNA and plasma biomarkers and use validated, translated data collection forms and
clinical/diagnostic protocols. To support these recruitment and data collection activities, we will form six Cores
that provide administrative oversite, outreach, clinical expertise, data management, biosample management,
and training and quality assurance to support recruitment and analysis activities. All samples will be
genotyped using SNP arrays and imputed using a large Asian-specific reference panel of whole genome
sequencing data from international Asian cohorts. We propose two Research Projects that will analyze genetic,
biomarker and clinical data to investigate impact of lifestyle risk factors, genetic variants for AD risk, evaluate
differential effects of sex and APOE genotypes on AD risk, and predict clinical diagnosis of AD using genetic
and lifestyle risk scores. We will replicate these findings through meta-analysis collaborations with
international Asian cohorts and AD studies from other populations."

Title: Structural dynamics underlying GPCR-G protein selectivity
Upon binding to agonists with different efficacies, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate
multiple signaling pathways by coupling to different subtypes of G proteins. Certain agonists exhibit
selectivity in their efficacy to specific G-protein signaling pathways. Such ligands provide precise
therapeutic benefits with fewer side effects as drugs compared to today's GPCR-targeted drugs. There
are very few selective ligands known for specific G-protein signaling pathways because designing such
agonists is a daunting experimental challenge. This is due to serious lack of understanding of how
GPCRs modulate their functional selectivity for their cognate G-protein when bound to different type of
agonists and in cells. In the past three years using a combination of multiscale molecular dynamics
(MD) method and genetically coded FRET sensors we have shown that GPCRs have latent intracellular
cavities that can reshape and couple to different G-proteins. By reengineering G-proteins and GPCRs
we have identified the hotspot residues in the GPCR-G-protein interface that serve as the “QR code” for
G-protein selective coupling by GPCRs. Although it is clear that allosteric communication from the
ligand binding site to the G-protein coupling site plays a role in G-protein selectivity very little is known
about the mechanism of this communication and the residues involved in this process. Here we
propose to (1) use the computational method Allosteer developed in our lab in combination with FRET
sensors, NanoBRET assays and cell based downstream assays to delineate the allosteric network of
GPCR residues involved in regulating G-protein selectivity in 9 different Gs, Gi and Gq coupled class A
GPCRs in cellular conditions. The second aim is to understand the effect of partial agonists in
comparison to the full agonists, on the GPCR-G-protein selective coupling. We will identify the hotspot
residues on the G-protein and GPCRs when bound to partial agonists and compare the similarities and
differences with full agonists. The outcome of the proposed work will provide the role of allosteric
network of residues in G-protein selectivity and how partial agonists modulate the receptor
conformations. This will push forward our understanding of the biological process of how GPCRs
recognize their cognate G-proteins in live cells."
10774224,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol misuse and related risky sexual behavior (RSB) are significant public health concerns among college
students. Two-thirds of students are current drinkers, at least 1 in 3 report past month binge drinking (5+ drinks
in a row), and 1 in 10 report high intensity drinking (10+ drinks in a row). Greater student alcohol consumption
and heavy drinking on a given day is linked to increased sexual activity and RSB (e.g., unprotected sex,
unplanned hook-ups). This puts students at risk for negative health outcomes (e.g., STIs) and is a pathway to
sexual victimization and escalated drinking. The first few weeks of college, or the ‘red zone,’ present a critical
window of opportunity to intervene for escalated alcohol use and associated risks, which can result in a potentially
high public health and clinical impact. However, individual-level prevention strategies for college students tend
to focus on students’ alcohol use patterns and consequences more broadly, with little to no integration of content
on the relationship between alcohol use and RSB, an important gap in the literature and a priority area for NIAAA.
Our team previously established the short-term efficacy of a personalized feedback intervention (PFI), a gold
standard intervention approach, with integrated content on alcohol and RSB. We propose to extend our
integrated PFI to include a cross-tailored dynamic feedback (CDF) component, which leverages technology to
incorporate daily assessments of student behavior and provide users with dynamic weekly feedback over 12
weeks to amplify the effectiveness of the integrated PFI and to be easily implemented on college campuses. The
project utilizes a multisite, hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study design to (1) evaluate the impact of
CDF for at-risk first-year college students and (2) identify implementation factors critical to its success to facilitate
future scale-up in campus settings. The first aim is to conduct a multi-level stakeholder-engaged adaptation of
the integrated alcohol and risky sex PFI through the development and inclusion of CDF. The second aim is to
conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the enhanced intervention (PFI+CDF) in a sample of 600 first-
year college students who report recent binge drinking and are sexually active. Our primary hypothesis is that
participants who receive the PFI+CDF intervention will report less alcohol use, fewer risky sexual behaviors, and
fewer consequences relative to those who receive a PFI supplemented with generic health information at follow-
up (1, 2, 3, 6, and 13 months). Our third aim seeks to identify factors critical to PFI+CDF implementation in
campus settings through conducting focus groups with a subset of students from the RCT and with local and
national systems-level stakeholders. The intervention has strong potential for widespread dissemination and
targets a group at high risk for alcohol misuse and RSB."

The mission of the Rat Resource and Research Center (RRRC) is to provide biomedical investigators with the
rat models, embryonic stem cells, related reagents, protocols, information, support and services that will facilitate
their research. The RRRC serves as a unique repository by importing, storing and distributing a large number of
rat strains/stocks. It assures that valuable models are preserved and made available to interested investigators,
allows researchers to satisfy NIH requirements for resource sharing, relieves individual investigators from the
burden of animal distribution and ensures that models are maintained with rigorous genetic quality control and
health monitoring to promote experimental rigor and reproducibility. Recent advances in genome editing
technologies are facilitating the ability to perform sophisticated genetic modifications in rats in order to study both
normal biological processes and disease states. As a result, the number of rat models and the number of
investigators using rat models for biomedical research is increasing and the RRRC, as one of the only centralized
repositories in the world will continue to serve a critical role for archiving and distributing these new models. To
improve repository functions, applied research to optimize methods for sperm cryopreservation and in vitro
fertilization in the rat will be undertaken and ongoing efforts to refine, generate and characterize new genetically
modified rat models needed by the research community will be performed. To expand the broad utility of the
RRRC, we will continue to serve as consultants to the community and we will increase our fee-for-services in
the areas of model generation, model characterization, colony management, cryopreservation and rederivation.
By providing accessible expertise to investigators working with rats and by expanding our available materials
and services, the RRRC will continue to serve as a much-needed “one stop” resource for investigators using rats
in biomedical research."
10781986,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Mutations in the Transthyretin (TTR) gene can lead to deposition of abnormal amyloid fibrils in the
myocardium, resulting in hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) and leading to heart
failure. Targeted therapies for hATTR-CM have recently been developed and have shown to improve mortality
and hospitalization.
 Recently, we led a study (Journal of American Medical Association, Dec 2019) that showed that the TTR
V122I mutation, commonly observed in racial/ethnic minorities (4% in African Americans (AAs) and 1% in
Hispanic Americans (HAs)), confers two-fold increased risk of heart failure. Despite this strong effect, only 11%
of V122I carriers with heart failure were appropriately diagnosed with hATTR-CM, suggesting marked
underdiagnosis and mis-diagnosis of the disease. We further showed subclinical evidence of
echocardiographic derangements in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers, suggesting early signs can occur
well before onset of disease.
 We propose to extend our prior work by addressing knowledge gaps which are necessary for targeted
therapies to attain their full potential. These include: understanding the incomplete penetrance of V122I;
identifying V122I carriers in large health care systems where genotyping is not common; and understanding
subclinical disease burden. In Aim 1, we will examine the interplay between a polygenic risk score, which are
comprised of millions of single nucleotide variants with small effects, and V122I, a monogenic mutation with a
single strong effect, analyzed in conjunction with clinical risk factors on heart failure in in 6,609 AAs and 9,006
HAs in the BioMe biobank and 5,833 AAs in the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB). In Aim 2, we will apply
machine learning tools to multi-modal electronic health record (EHR) data to identify V122I carriers in ~8
million patients from an electronic health record (EHR) data repository at Mount Sinai. In Aim 3, we will
evaluate subclinical effects of amyloid deposition on cardiac structural/functional traits in young, asymptomatic
V122I carriers by recalling V122I carriers for imaging evaluation including research-grade echocardiograms,
cardiac magnetic resonance and technetium nuclear scanning.
 The proposal is innovative because we are utilizing two large diverse ancestry EHR-linked biobanks from
academic health systems (BioMe at Mount Sinai, and PMBB at University of Pennsylvania), along with
adopting cutting-edge methods including multi-ethnic polygenic risk scores, and machine learning approaches
on multi-modal EHR data. We further propose patient recall based on genotypes and perform deep
phenotyping using comprehensive heart imaging scans.
 This proposal has the potential to realize the potential of precision medicine for heart failure in racial/ethnic
minorities by informing clinical care, population management, risk stratification and clinical trials."
10791833,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. While significant changes in cannabis potency, methods of use (e.g.,
flower, edibles) and policy have occurred, high levels of use by youth remain relatively constant. In addition,
rates of secondhand cannabis exposure in children is increasing. The cannabis plant contains over 120
cannabinoid constituents, with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a psychoactive constituent, most
associated with deficits in verbal memory, attention, and working memory; however, the persistence of these
effects remains controvertible. Differences in frequency, method of use, and potency may produce variation in
measures of cannabis metabolized. Research to-date has primarily relied on self-report, despite potential mis-
reporting by participants and reliance on episodic (rather than dose or patterns) of cannabis use, and almost
no research investigating secondhand exposure. Such limitations may explain prior inconsistencies in the
cannabis-cognition literature. The primary aim of this K08 proposal is to facilitate interdisciplinary expertise in
toxicology to examine cannabinoid analyte levels using a robust biosample (hair) to assess cognitive
correlates. The use of hair allows for improved methodological investigation of the relationship between
cannabis use, secondhand smoke exposure, and potential cognitive impact. Expansion of hair analysis in the
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study will add novel and important knowledge to the
scientific body of literature regarding the cannabis-cognition link, clarifying prior discrepant results of both
negative and null cognitive function changes associated with cannabis using adolescents, and examining the
influence of second-hand cannabis smoke. Causal inference models will be used to determine the influence of
THC and its metabolite levels from hair on cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive function among a
subsample of the ABCD cohort. Cognition and substance use will be measured annually for the length of the
proposed project, when ABCD participants are between the ages of 13-14 and 17-18 years. The aims of this
project are consistent with NIDA's strategic funding plans, as this work would measure behavioral sequelae of
environmental and direct exposure of cannabis in a vulnerable, young population. The additional training
afforded to Dr. Wade, particularly in cannabis toxicology, secondhand smoke exposure, early adolescence,
and statistics, would complement her prior experience in substance use, neurocognition, and emerging adults.
A mentorship team of experts will bridge these unique fields to improve our understanding of the effects of
THC exposure (personal use or environmental exposure) on adolescent cognitive development. At the
conclusion of this award, Dr. Wade will meet her goal of career independence as an interdisciplinary clinical
scientist with expertise in cannabis toxicology and cognition, exemplified by submission of an R01. Finally, the
funding of analysis of additional hair samples will also benefit the open-science model of ABCD, as all data
collected will be available to researchers worldwide through the annual curated ABCD data release."

Hospitalized patients receiving antibiotic treatment experience a disruption in the intestinal microbiome
enabling opportunistic pathogens, such as Clostridioides difficile to colonize the intestinal tract. Complications
resulting from C. difficile associated disease are a major burden on the health care system costing an
estimated one billion dollars and resulting in 12,000-20,000 deaths per year (11, 13). Current antibiotic
treatment options have a high recurrence rate highlighting the need to develop alternative treatment strategies.
Fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) has proven to be a remarkable effective strategy for treatment of
recurrent C. difficile infection (21). However, the host and microbial factors that contribute to FMT success
remain poorly defined. The murine model of C. difficile infection offers insights into the mechanism of action of
FMT. Data presented in this proposal demonstrates an important role for the host’s immune system,
specifically CD4+ T-regulatory (TReg) cells, in supporting FMT efficacy. In aim 1 of this proposal we will
investigate the immunoregulatory mechanisms through which TReg cells shape the intestinal environment to
promote FMT engraftment and C. difficile resolution. Conversely, aim 2, will assess the innate immune
inflammatory mediators that shape the intestinal environment to inhibit FMT engraftment and C. difficile
resolution. In parallel to murine studies, we will conduct longitudinal profiling of human immune cell populations
in severe C. difficile infected patients before and after FMT. These aims will identify immune mechanisms that
support successful FMT therapy in C. difficile infection and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets in
treating C. difficile associated disease.

10897705,"PROJECT 1: IDENTIFICATION OF HOST AND BACTERIAL PATHWAYS THAT CONTROL TB
PATHOGENESIS IN HUMANS
SUMMARY
Phagocytes of the mammalian innate immune system, in particular macrophages, form the first line of
defense upon bacterial infection and are armed with powerful mechanisms to limit bacterial growth and
eradicate invaders. In addition to having direct antimicrobial activity, macrophages also initiate and shape
powerful inflammatory responses that dramatically influence disease. Bacterial pathogens, however, have
evolved mechanisms to thwart these killing mechanisms of phagocytes, and to persist in human tissues.
Indeed, the inflammatory pathways robustly elicited by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) – the etiological
agent of the devastating human disease tuberculosis (TB) and the focus of Project 1 – work to promote
bacterial growth and TB disease. However, the host genes and cellular pathways that dictate the outcome
of infection are not entirely clear. There is growing evidence that the earliest interactions of Mtb with two
very different subsets of lung macrophages, alveolar and “recruited” macrophages, are critical for TB
control, but our understanding of the response of alveolar macrophages to Mtb has been limited due to the
difficulty in studying these tissue resident lung macrophages. In Project 1, we will use new cellular models of
alveolar macrophages coupled with unbiased, systematic approaches to identify the specific molecular
networks that underly infection of these different macrophage types. In collaboration with the Technology
Core, we will use this information to make predictions about bacterial infectivity that will be tested in human
samples and mouse models of infection in an iterative fashion to model host response during infection.
These results, and those from Project 2, will be integrated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics and
Modeling Cores with existing -omics and human GWAS datasets to identify host and bacterial signatures that
correlate significantly with clinical pathogenesis. Importantly, we will focus our functional testing on pathways
that are shared between bacterial and viral responses (with Project 2) to understand the mechanisms that lead
to synergies during bacterial-viral co-infection."
10764269,"Title: Genome-wide Mapping of Ribosome Occupancies with Inhibitor-Induced mRNA Covalent
Labeling
 Ribosome profiling is a powerful method to study translation through genome-wide mapping of
translating ribosomes. This breakthrough technology has illuminated many facets of protein synthesis,
such as ribosomal pausing, alternative initiation sites, and protein synthesis rates across numerous
cellular systems. Although recent innovations have reduced ribosome profiling to single cells, ribosome
profiling typically requires large numbers of cells to conduct and therefore is not routinely used to study
rare cell types and clinical samples. Furthermore, ribosome profiling fragments mRNA and hence
cannot map multiple ribosomes along a single mRNA molecule and requires integration of separate
mRNA sequencing datasets to account for the total number of transcripts. New efficient methods to
simultaneously measure ribosome occupancies and mRNA abundance by preserving mRNA integrity
would further enable the global study of translational regulation and provide new fundamental insight
into translation dynamics. To bridge these technological gaps, here we propose to develop new small
molecule tools based off the natural product ribosome inhibitors to chemically footprint ribosome
positioning atop mRNA transcripts through covalent labeling. Our central hypothesis is that these
mRNA chemical footprints can be detected through error prone reverse transcription and subsequent
mRNA sequencing to map ribosome occupancies while maintaining the integrity of the mRNA. This
approach is termed ribosome mutational profiling (Ribo-MaP). To develop Ribo-MaP, the first aim
proposes the structure-based design of natural product derivatives that potently inhibit ribosome
elongation while maintaining polysome stability. Critically, these derivatives are based off emetine, a
ribosome inhibitor which contacts the mRNA template to block translation. Furthermore, photoaffinity
labeling groups will be attached to these emetine derivatives and the ability to covalently label mRNA
will be tested. Additionally, an alternative approach for mRNA covalent labeling is proposed, in which
emetine derivatives will be functionalized with reactive acylating groups to label the proximal mRNA 2'-
hydroxyl. In both approaches, mRNA labeling efficiency and the ability to readout covalent modifications
as mutations in error prone reverse transcription will be measured. In the second aim, the ability of
Ribo-MaP to map ribosome occupancies genome-wide will be evaluated and benchmarked against
conventional ribosome profiling. We expect that Ribo-MaP will bypass inefficient steps in ribosome

emerging technologies for single-cell and long-read mRNA sequencing. Altogether, Ribo-MaP would
provide a highly enabling method to broadly study protein synthesis and ribosome dynamics in cells."

Continuous differentiation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) maintains the integrity of intestinal epithelium while
producing diverse functional cells at rapid pace. This epithelium also displays remarkable cell plasticity,
including the ability of mature cells to dedifferentiate into stem cells upon loss of ISCs. As many genetic and
signaling drivers of this cell fate reversion are being discovered, cell intrinsic epigenetic controls that must be
rewired for cell plasticity, remain largely unknown. Using state-of-the-art single-cell sc-Multiome assays that
reveal chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and gene expression (scRNA-seq) in parallel, we have recently
produced high-quality data comparing native epithelial cells and cells undergoing regeneration upon ISC
ablation. Using these data and innovative computational methods, we will chart the chromatin and gene
expression dynamic underlying cell fate changes in intestinal regeneration, and identify key epigenetic
modulators and transcription factor controllers of this process. In conjunction with these analyses, we propose
to delineate promoter and enhancer relevant epigenetic controls (histone modifications) through the time
course of regeneration.
Aberrant chromatin structure can cause gene dysregulation and contribute to tumorigenesis, including
colorectal cancer. DNA methylation is the most frequently modulated epigenetic modality in colorectal as well
as many other cancers. However, determinants of the reciprocal interactions between DNA methylation and
mutational changes or other epigenetic layers have not been studied critically. Also missing is the knowledge
of how early in tumorigenesis does the DNA methylation change occur and how uniform are the changes in
DNA methylation across cells. Technological limitations have been the most significant barrier for such
analyses, as current methods to characterize DNA methylation at single-cell level suffer from low CpG
coverage limited to gene promoters and GpG islands, which precludes understanding of the true breadth of
DNA methylation change, particularly at gene regulatory enhancers. We propose to override these limitations
through development of a novel assay for characterizing DNA methylation as well as RNA expression at
single-cell level. We combine chemical methods geared to preserve DNA integrity and gentler nuclei handling
based on magnetic bead capture in our method called scTaMT-seq, which will provide a robust protocol for
analyzing DNA methylation in unprecedented detail at highest possible resolution. This technology will propel
the understanding of epigenomic impact on various biological processes, particularly cancer."

Mosquitoes transmit multiple diseases worldwide accounting for millions of disease cases and
hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. The United States is not immune to the scourge of
mosquito-borne disease, as mosquitoes in the USA can transmit dengue and Zika viruses as
well as West Nile and La Crosse encephalitis virus. Mosquitoes are also a substantial nuisance
that reduce quality of life and enjoyment of outdoor activity. Control of mosquito populations is
the primary way we prevent disease transmission and nuisance issues. Many new methods of
mosquito population reduction involve a modified version of a method called sterile insect
technique (SIT) in which males are made reproductively sterile in a laboratory and released to
mate with wild females. This results in zero offspring and a reduction in the population of that
targeted mosquito species. SIT requires mass rearing of male mosquitoes in large rearing
facilities and these males must be healthy and able to compete with wild males for mates. Here,
we propose to investigate the potential impact the mosquito bacterial microbiota (i.e. bacteria in
the mosquito body) may have on male Aedes aegypti mosquito traits that are relevant for SIT
including longevity, body size, and ability to compete for mates. We will also investigate the way
the microbiota affects the transcriptome of males. This work will be the first in-depth
investigation into the role of the microbiota in male mosquito fitness traits and will provide key
insight into ways the microbiota might be leveraged to improve SIT for mosquito control."

Many steps in drug discovery, as well as in basic biological research, could be accelerated with methods that
measure multiple phenotypes simultaneously, known as profiling technologies. When a cell or organism’s
function is affected by disease, a chemical compound, or a genetic perturbation, simultaneously measuring
many phenotypes provides greater power and less bias in identifying their impact. But many existing assays
require many painstaking months to develop and measure only one specific phenotype, missing potentially
crucial information - for example, a chemical might have positive effects on a disease-related assay but its
effects on other pathways are unmeasured, leading to undetected toxicity that is only discovered later.
Research in this MIRA period will focus on advancing algorithms and applications for image-based profiling, a
surprisingly quantitative type of profiling that is the least expensive and among the highest in information
content. Image-based profiling captures the location and amount of each stained cellular component, as well as
changes in morphology, but its applications are underexplored and its algorithms underdeveloped. Having
invented the main assay and software in the field, we aim to bring the technique to maturity now that four
things have become available or possible: (a) Image Data - huge quantities of suitable systematic, structured,
high-throughput, single-cell image data, usually from the Cell Painting assay, via several public-private
partnerships and totaling more than 3 billion single cells across more than 100,000 genetic and chemical
perturbations; (b) Algorithms - novel deep learning algorithms for several steps in profiling: segmentation,
feature extraction, and learning predictive models; (c) Integration - other data sources now available at a
scale that can be fruitfully combined with images; (d) Applications - out of more than a dozen theoretical
applications, many have not been attempted or scaled up for basic biological research and drug discovery, such
as determining compounds’ mechanism of action, identifying their targets, discovering relationships with
genes, predicting toxicity or other assay activity, and identifying gene function.
To fulfill the promise and real-world efficacy of image-based profiling, we therefore aim to leverage recently
available data and algorithms to carry out diverse biological applications, including identifying gene- and
compound-associated phenotypes and functions, virtual screening to identify potential compounds that target
genes of interest, hypothesizing the mechanism of action/targets for small molecules, computationally
predicting assay activity and toxicity, and identifying screenable disease-associated phenotypes. In doing so, we
aim to make rapid progress in algorithms, including trained neural networks/deep learning models, multi-
modal integration, visualization/interpretation, batch correction, and single-cell methods."

Eukaryotic cells transport cargo between subcellular organelles, and to the plasma membrane for secretion,
using small membrane-bound vesicles are carriers. The regulation of vesicular transport and membrane fusion
processes are crucial for cellular morphology, growth, movement and secretion, including hormone release
and neurotransmission. Many essential proteins are required for these processes, including the SNARE
proteins and Sec1 that are involved in the membrane fusion process, the Rab and Rho GTPases, and the
exocyst octameric tethering complex. Exocyst has been implicated in a number of different functions involved
in recognition, tethering and quality control of SNARE assembly and fusion, but none of these are well
understood at the molecular level. We use a multidisciplinary strategy of biochemical, structural and
biophysical techniques, combined with genetics and cell biological methods, to understand the molecular
architecture and function of the exocyst complex, Sec1 and regulation of SNARE complex assembly and
fusion. We study the exocyst proteins from the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae to take advantage
of the wealth of genetic, cell biological and biochemical techniques available, but have expanded to exocyst
from other organisms. Our studies aim to address the following fundamental questions: How is the specificity of
vesicle targeting and fusion achieved? How do exocyst and Sec1 function to regulate SNAREs? What are the
roles for different partner proteins and lipids? What happens when exocyst and Sec1 functions are
dysregulated? Because these proteins are conserved from yeast to human neurons, this research will advance
our knowledge of how secretion and growth are regulated in all eukaryotic cells. We will also illuminate the
molecular consequences of disease-associated dysfunction."
10758266,"The Influence of Neuronal States on Perception and Behavior
Unlike reflexes, most of our behaviors are governed by internal states such as satiety or arousal that influence how we
respond to our environment. The ability to regulate our internal state in response to experience is immediately evident
in mental pathologies where this process is broken. In maladaptive disorders such as Attention Hyperactivity Deficit
Disorder (ADHD) or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the brain’s ability to properly coordinate salient sensory
inputs with appropriate behavioral responses is fundamentally flawed, and in extreme psychiatric disorders such as
schizophrenia, sensory information is nearly shut-out entirely, as nearly all behaviors are driven by internal
representations of the world, i.e. hallucinations and delusions. Functional understandings of how these disorders arise
are very limited, in part because of the complexity of the underlying processes that produce these behaviors. However,
researching internal states in non-humans is challenging for two reasons. 1. These states are often encoded by
neuromodulators, but are behaviorally defined based on the probabilities of observed behaviors; the organisms often do
not leave a record of their intent. To simplify analysis, these assays often investigate binary states such as satiety vs.
hunger, arousal vs. not aroused, even though natural behaviors are not necessarily bimodal. 2. How neuromodulators
alter specific synaptic relationships in a circuit is daunting in unannotated, complex circuits.
However, both of these challenges can be addressed by using the right model system. Animals that build structures in
defined phases, such as orb-weaving spiders, leave a physical record of their behavioral intent, thus simplifying the
definition of behavioral states. These paradigms are also more ethologically relevant, as the animals are allowed to
perform complex behaviors without the need for learning an artificial binary tasks. Likewise, small animals like C. elegans
have defined and annotated synaptic topologies that can be investigated under different neuromodulatory contexts,
providing us with an unparalleled ability to understand neuromodulatory rewiring with single neuron resolution. More
specifically, how neuron computations like synergistic integration are altered can be addressed in explicitly defined
neurons and synapses. My long-term goal is to understand how internal states organize behavior, and more explicitly,
how the neuromodulators that define these states alter the function of neuronal circuits.
We aim to make two key advancements in the field. 1) We will build a neuromodulatory map of how these pathways
coordinate multiple behaviors beyond a binary paradigm. 2) We will quantify how internal states modulate synergistic
coupling between neurons."

 Autism-spectrum disorders impact millions of individuals worldwide, representing a heavy toll on affected
children, their families, and the health care system. Pitt–Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS) is an ASD caused by de
novo mutations in the TCF4 gene. PTHS is characterized by severe intellectual disability, pronounced
developmental and motor delays, absence of speech, repetitive behaviors, peculiar facial gestalt, and
gastrointestinal manifestations. While the genetic etiology of PTHS is well established, the cellular and neural
phenotypic alterations in human patients are still not fully understood, nor is it clear how TCF4 mutations
cause such abnormalities. Lack of understanding about PTHS's molecular and cellular mechanisms is a
problem because, until this information becomes available, specific altered pathways cannot be therapeutically
targeted. Moreover, without neuropathological knowledge, it is impossible to treat and eventually cure PTHS
by directly correcting the mutation in the genome.
 Our long-term goal is to understand how specific genetic defects and altered pathways in the brain result
in the debilitating phenotypes exhibited by autistic children. The objectives of this application are to: (a) use
human models of neural development in vitro to define the cellular and neural pathological consequences of
clinically relevant TCF4 mutations in PTHS; and (b) provide proof-of-concept that correctional molecular
strategies can be used to fix TCF4 expression, an approach that could eventually be used as gene therapy for
PTHS. Our central hypothesis is that TCF4 mutations cause aberrant phenotypes in specific cell types of the
nervous system, leading to the patients' neurological symptoms. We postulated that patient-derived in vitro
models of PTHS can better recapitulate the pathophysiology than mouse models, because brain structure,
genome architecture and development vary greatly between rodents and humans, and current PTHS animal
models do not closely mimic all the disease's clinically relevant aspects. In preliminary experiments, we
obtained patient-derived brain organoids and cultured neural cell types in vitro and used them as human
models to show that PTHS neural progenitor cells exhibit senescence and decreased proliferation,
accompanied by downregulation of Wnt signaling and SOX3 expression. Moreover, we observed that PTHS
brain organoids fail to develop normal anatomically organized progenitor structures and that PTHS neurons
display severely impaired firing properties. Our anticipated results/deliverables include the identification and
manipulation of specific altered molecular pathways and neural cell types and the testing of genetic
correctional strategies for the disease, which could propel future research on pharmacological and gene
therapy for PTHS."
10770428,"This project utilizes mechanistic pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic modeling to guide the development of new
therapeutic strategies, and new therapeutic agents, to improve the safety and efficacy of antibody-drug conjugate
(ADC) therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The project will generate new monoclonal antibodies and
nanobodies with specificity for three surface proteins overexpressed in AML (CD123, CLL1, TIM3). The new
antibodies and nanobodies will be used as targeting vectors to deliver candidate payload molecules (MMAE,
DM4, SN38, Dxd) to AML cells (Aim #1). Within experiments proposed in Aim #2, the targeting vectors will be
assembled into bispecific constructs to test the hypothesis that bispecific ADCs enable improved efficacy and
decreased off-site on-target toxicity. Aim #3 will investigate a newly developed inverse targeting strategy, where
co-treatment with payload binding antibody fragments (i.e., Payload Binding Selectivity Enhancers, PBSE) is
employed to decrease the delivery of payload molecules to healthy tissues, enabling reduced off-site off-target
toxicity. PBSE with high affinity for MMAE, DM4, SN38, and Dxd will be evaluated for utility in preventing the off-
site, off-target toxicity that results from the exposure of healthy cells to released (i.e., “free”) payload. Due to the
selective binding of PBSE to free payload, with little or no binding of PBSE to intact ADCs, we hypothesize that
our new PBSE agents will allow decreased toxicity of anti-AML ADC therapy, without negatively impacting ADC
efficacy. Aim #4 will perform in vivo experiments in mouse models of human AML to evaluate the effects and
toxicities of monospecific anti-AML ADCs and bispecific ADCs, with or without cotreatment with PBSE. Due to
our development of several targeting vectors, each with a wide range of possible characteristics (e.g., affinity,
modality [nanobody, mAb], bispecificity), and due to our intent to consider several payload molecules, with or
without PBSE co-treatment, many permutations may be considered. Additionally, complete and appropriate
experimental evaluation of relationships between ADC attributes and therapeutic utility is not possible in animal
models, due to the unavailability of models with appropriate co-expression patterns of human antigens on healthy
cells, AML bulk cells, leukemic blasts, and leukemic stem cells. To address these complexities and limitations,
mechanistic PKPD modeling and simulation will be employed throughout the project to predict effects and
toxicities in mouse models and in AML patients, to facilitate engineering efforts (e.g., predicting relationships
between affinity of bispecific binding arms and therapeutic selectivity), and to guide selection of constructs for in
vivo evaluations."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal hematological malignancy with limited therapeutic options. It
originates from and is sustained by a small population of self-renewing precursor cells - leukemia initiating/stem
cells (LSCs). This immortal reservoir of tumor cells displays extremely low proliferation rates and resistance to
current treatments. They are also responsible for relapses. It remains a critical challenge to develop effective
therapeutics to eradicate LSCs. A novel approach focused on the unique characteristics and vulnerabilities of
LSCs is needed in order to address this problem. We previously discovered a bioenergetic stress-induced
differentiation/repopulation checkpoint in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in studying PTPMT1, a mitochondria-
based phosphoinositide phosphatase. Knockout of PTPMT1 decreases mitochondrial metabolism and causes
bioenergetic stress, which in turn triggers a cell cycle checkpoint (AMPK-p21/p57), leading to differentiation-
associated cell cycle arrest in HSCs. Importantly, the survival and self-renewal of these knockout HSCs are not
affected, and their differentiation block is reversible. Our recent preliminary study suggests that a similar
bioenergetic stress-induced cell cycle checkpoint may also operate in LSCs --- the development and
maintenance of oncogene (FLT3-ITD and MLL-AF9)-driven or PTEN loss-induced AML are substantially
inhibited by the deletion of PTPMT1. Interestingly, PTPMT1 depletion induces cell death in LSCs, in sharp
contrast to HSCs. Mechanistically, PTPMT1 loss does not impact mitochondrial structure; rather, it appears to
block mitochondrial utilization of the major metabolic substrate pyruvate, a key metabolite derived from glucose
that lies at the intersection of mitochondrial oxidation and cytosolic fermentation. Based on these observations,
we hypothesize that LSCs can be targeted by inducing bioenergetic/metabolic stress and cell cycle arrest
through pharmacological inhibition of PTPMT1 or mitochondrial uptake of pyruvate, which yields the possibility
of eradicating LSCs. Notably, alexidine dihydrochloride, an antibiotic used as an anti-septic and anti-plaque
agent for dental products, has been identified as a selective and potent PTPMT1 inhibitor, and rosiglitazone
(Avandia), a viable anti-type 2 diabetic drug (previously known as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ
agonist), has been shown to effectively inhibit the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier/transporter (MPC). As a result,
the novel properties of these drugs will serve as a critical asset for testing our hypothesis. We plan to achieve
the objective of this proposal by pursuing the following three aims. 1). To further characterize the effects of
PTPMT1 depletion on LSCs. 2). To determine the molecular mechanisms by which PTPMT1 depletion inhibits
mitochondrial metabolism. 3). To test for the potential therapeutic effects of the PTPMT1 inhibitor alexidine
dihydrochloride and the MPC inhibitor rosiglitazone in xenograft models of human AML. This project, if
successful, may lead to a novel strategy to deplete LSCs in AML, and the PTPMT1 and MPC inhibitors could be
repurposed and further developed into therapeutic agents for AML."

Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. There are several subtypes of MB,
and among them, the GLI2-amplified SHH-MB subtype has the worst prognosis and a poor survival rate; the 5-
year survival rate is <30%. Moreover, the GLI2-amplified MBs are non-responsive to the only targeted treatment
option available for SHH-MB, the SMO inhibitors. This leaves an unmet critical treatment gap, and there is an
urgent need to identify novel targets to develop effective therapeutics. However, a deeper understanding of the
cellular and molecular mechanisms driving GLI2-amplified MB tumorigenesis is currently lacking. With a focused
goal to resolve this particular type of MB tumorigenesis, we recently generated an engineered mouse model of
GLI2-driven MB. Using this model, we demonstrated that GLI2 is the critical driver of tumorigenesis and identified
granule cell progenitors (GCPs) as the cells of origin. Interestingly, we have also found that GLI2 drives only
Math1+ embryonic GCPs but not neonatal GCPs to form SHH-MB. Correspondingly, our scRNA-seq analysis
revealed that the MAPK pathway is specifically enriched in embryonic but not neonatal Math1+ GCPs. Moreover,
the MAPK pathway is activated in mouse and human GLI2-driven MB tumors, and a MEK/ERK inhibitor
significantly delayed the growth of GLI2-driven MB in vivo. Based on these exciting preliminary data, we put
forward a novel hypothesis that GLI2-driven MB originates from a specific cell population of Math1+
GCPs and in a particular spatiotemporal window during cerebellar development. Therefore, targeting
MAPK/MEK/ERK pathway in the embryonic GCPs in a specific timeframe can effectively prevent GLI2-
driven MB initiation and progression. In this proposal, we plan to use our new GLI2-driven MB transgenic
mouse model to define the spatiotemporal window of tumorigenesis of GLI2-driven MB more precisely and
establish whether MAPK/MEK/ERK signaling is required for GLI2-driven MB initiation and development.
Furthermore, we will use GLI2-amplified MB patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to evaluate the efficacy of
MEK/ERK inhibitors in preventing tumor progression and examine the mechanisms underlying therapeutic
resistance. We will pursue our ultimate goal to design novel therapeutics and achieve better treatment outcomes
by targeting MAPK/MEK/ERK pathway and via identifying additional combinational therapeutic opportunities to
fight against tumor relapse. Since aberrant expression of GLI2 occurs in a number of other tumor types, our
studies will also set a precedent for all GLI2-driven malignancies."
10782462,"Summary
The biochemical hallmark of FKRP-associated dystroglycanopathies is the hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan
(α-DG), which leads to disruption in the interaction of α-DG with extracellular matrix proteins, ultimately leading
to muscle wasting. Recessive mutations in FKRP are associated with a heterogeneous spectrum of muscle
disorders, ranging from severe early-onset to mild late-onset limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2I) to several
forms of congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1C), including severe Walker-Warburg Syndrome. Respiratory
impairment due to loss of diaphragm function is a prominent complication of both LGMD2I and MDC1C. No
approved therapy currently exists for dystroglycanopathies. There has been tremendous excitement for the
therapeutic potential of reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in treating genetic diseases. The
premise of this project is that stem cell-based therapy consisting of human skeletal myogenic progenitors derived
from iPSCs will replenish diseased muscle with normal functional muscle fibers as well as muscle stem cells,
which have the potential to provide long-term therapeutic effect in dystroglycanopathies. We have developed
and extensively validated a method to generate engraftable skeletal myogenic progenitors from pluripotent stem
cells through conditional expression of Pax3 or Pax7. This approach results in highly efficient generation of
therapeutic myogenic progenitors, which when transplanted into dystrophic mice locally or systemically produce
large quantities of functional skeletal muscle tissue that incorporates normally into the host muscle. Importantly,
a fraction of transplanted cells remains mononuclear, and displays key features of skeletal muscle stem cells,
including satellite cell localization, response to re-injury, and contribution to muscle regeneration in secondary
transplantation assays. Therefore, our technology comprises a cell therapy to rebuild functional skeletal muscle,
robust to future damage, in hosts with muscular dystrophy. We have recently shown that mouse and human
PSC-derived myogenic progenitors contribute to significant myofiber and satellite cell repopulation in the
immunodeficient FKRPP448L-NSG mouse model that we generated. Of therapeutic relevance, we have evidence
of successful delivery of these myogenic progenitors directly into the diaphragm of FKRP mice. In addition, we
have developed a universal gene correction strategy for FKRP, applied this to patient-specific WWS and LGMD2I
iPSCs, and demonstrated in vitro and in vivo rescue of functional α-DG glycosylation. In this application, we
propose studies that are critical for the development of successful therapeutic approaches for
dystroglycanopathies, including understanding 1) the effect of the environment on the engraftment of
transplanted cells and 2) the long-term functionality and molecular characteristics of human gene edited WWS
and unaffected iPSC-derived myogenic progenitors, important for both autologous and allogeneic future
therapeutic applications, respectively."

The Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC) is one of seven National Primate Research Centers
(NPRCs) supported by the NIH. The SNPRC houses a Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) rhesus macaque colony
of Indian origin (Ind RM), supported by the NIH SPF rhesus breeding program (U42OD010442). This colony is
derived from the combination of two long-standing SPF colonies, the US Air Force (USAF) and the New England
Primate Research Center (NEPRC). This colony of approximately 800 animals supports AIDS-related research
both at SNPRC and through sales to AIDS investigators at other institutions. In both cases, these animals
primarily support NIH-funded investigator initiated and program-level research in the areas of HIV vaccine
development, cure research, pathogenesis, therapeutics development, and co-infections such as TB. In the past
two years this resource has also been critical in supporting the development of NHP models of SARS-CoV-2
infection and for the subsequent testing of COVID-19 vaccines e.g., the Pfizer B2 vaccine which has been
administered to hundreds of million individuals worldwide, and therapeutic approaches for COVID-19 such as
the Regeneron antibody cocktail. The SNPRC resource is being used both by internal scientists who are faculty
members of the host institution Texas Biomed, as well as in support of external scientists who either conduct
primate research in situ at the SNPRC, acquire animals via sales, or request specific samples.
There is currently a major national shortage of research nonhuman primates (NHPs), and particularly of SPF Ind
RM. This has severely impacted our program-wide (all NPRCs) ability to support the national research mission
of HIV/AIDS as well as in the area of non-AIDS/other infectious diseases, AIDS co-infections, malaria, TB,
COVID-19, etc. The SNPRC is particularly affected due to its small colony size and recent recruitment of
scientists with large programs that utilize Ind RM. The NIH has recognized this need for expansion of SPF rhesus
production and strongly recommends increasing Ind RM breeding capacity. The SNPRC is well positioned to
expand its SPF Ind RM production as a center located in a climate hospitable to largely outdoor housing at an
institution with capacity for expansion. Texas Biomed has recently raised funds to build a large new NHP facility
which could house an additional ~ 800 NHPs. Texas Biomed/SNPRC has also been funded by the NIH/ORIP
via a C06 to expand our production capacity by 40% over our existing capacity. Finally, through the support of
our host institution, Texas Biomed, we have procured ~ 150 conventional founder/breeder Ind RM to increase
our breeding and populate the soon to be renovated/constructed buildings. As such the SNPRC Ind RM
population can increase to 1600-2000 in the next decade. While some of the new animals in the SNPRC colony
over the next five years will form a separate P51 colony which will not be restricted to HIV/AIDS related research,
and at least a 20-40% increase in the U42 colony is expected. Additionally, the development of a P51 colony
will support non-ID and non-HIV ID projects such as TB and COVID-19, and support the development of new
models. This will ensure that the U42 resource is exclusively available for HIV studies. As such, while the
ability of the SNPRC to serve as a national resource of SPF Ind RM has increased significantly in the past
performance period, we are poised to serve the needs of both internal and external scientists to a greater level
in the future. This renewal application proposes the continuation of successful approaches which have allowed
the maintenance of a clean, genetically diverse, SPF Ind RM colony, but with focus on increasing the number of
SPF animals in the colony. With the continued support of its U42 application, the SNPRC is poised to
substantially contribute to a meaningful reduction in the national shortage of SPF Ind RM."

The proposed R01 aims to augment data from the FORCE-TJR national Registry with radiographic readings,
geospatial information and Medicare claims data to quantify timeliness of total knee replacement (TKR), and
investigate the social determinants (SD) affecting timing of TKR. We propose 3 specific aims. Aim 1 applies
validated appropriateness criteria to a representative sample of the FORCE-TJR registry patients to classify
them as either premature or appropriate but with 5 different levels of functional disability. Aim 2 appends this
sample with geospatial information (SD) about their environment and determine the effect of the SD factors on
TKR utilization. Aim 3 determine the effect of the SD factors on improvement after surgery. We examine the
effect of SD factors related to (1) the medical care environment (i.e., access to and practice patterns of medical
care) and (2) the built environment (i.e., all of the physical parts of where we live and work (e.g., homes,
buildings, streets, open spaces, and infrastructure)). Our project will be the first to examine timing of TKR at a
national level, and will provide new knowledge regarding the association of the medical care and built
environments with timeliness of TKR utilization. Our findings will also inform clinical and public policy
interventions aimed at targeting TKR to those who would benefit most from the procedure, and add to evidence
that would support the proposition that improvements to the environment could lead to an overall reduction in
disability pertaining to knee osteoarthritis."

 2 For many reproductive-age cancer survivors, access to safe and effective methods for fertility preservation is
 3 an essential but often elusive path to creating a family. As more women delay childbirth, and greater numbers
 4 of women are not reaching their desired family size at the time of cancer diagnosis, fertility concerns have
 5 become increasingly relevant. Although the appropriateness of fertility treatment varies by clinical and patient
 6 factors, cancer survivors are more likely to require assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) at a younger age
 7 and may have lower chances of conceiving. Methods to achieve fertility goals using ARTs are important to
 8 cancer survivors in two distinct settings, either at cancer diagnosis for fertility preservation or after completing
 9 cancer treatment. For many survivors, factors at the individual (e.g., race/ethnicity, insurance status),
10 neighborhood (e.g., household income, education, geographic access to ART clinics), and policy levels create
11 substantial barriers to accessing these methods. Therefore, as fertility options for cancer survivors become
12 more common and successful, a potential new area for health care disparity has emerged. In addition, unequal
13 insurance coverage for fertility preservation and the use of ARTs after cancer treatment further magnifies the
14 disparities for medically underserved survivors. Most women who receive ARTs pay out-of-pocket for their
15 treatment, making this option prohibitively expensive for those with limited financial resources. The overall
16 objective of our study is to answer two distinct questions: 1. What are the sources and extent of disparities in
17 fertility preservation, access to ARTs, and live births among cancer survivors? 2. Does improving access to
18 ARTs mitigate these disparities? We will evaluate how dimensions of social disparities arising from individual-
19 level, neighborhood-level (social determinants measured at census tract), and policy-level (state insurance
20 mandates) factors affect access to and use of ARTs and live births. Specifically, we aim to 1) investigate
21 individual-, neighborhood-, and policy-level factors associated with fertility preservation; 2) investigate
22 individual-, neighborhood-, and policy-level factors associated with ART use after completion of cancer
23 treatment; and 3) quantify the contribution of individual-, neighborhood-, policy-level factors to live birth rates
24 after cancer, and whether live birth rates after cancer will be lower in medically underserved populations and
25 partially mediated by ART use. Creation of a family is a basic human right, and ensuring equitable access to
26 oncofertility services for all populations is key to addressing cancer care disparities for reproductive-age cancer
27 survivors. The deleterious effects of cancer treatments on fertility among medically underserved cancer
28 survivors has emerged as an important area of widening disparity in health care. Study findings should reveal
29 the mechanisms underlying disparities in access to ARTs and could be used by policymakers to improve
30 access to ARTs for vulnerable populations."
10764802,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sensorimotor learning plays a critical role in the acquisition and refining of all skilled movements, including
speech production. From early babbling to fully mature speech articulation, auditory-motor learning reflects
central nervous system processes involved in acquiring and updating neural representations of the intricate
motor-to-auditory transformations from motor commands to vocal tract movements and speech sound output.
Auditory-motor learning is also believed to play an important role in the etiology of developmental speech
disorders such as stuttering and childhood apraxia of speech. Over the past two decades, the PI’s laboratory
has made important contributions to the field’s understanding of the key mechanisms underlying such speech
auditory-motor learning in children and adults. We now propose a novel series of experiments, combining
behavioral learning paradigms with a highly innovative neurophysiological approach that allows us to both
modulate and record subcortical neural activity. Specifically, we aim to investigate (a) how speech auditory-
motor learning can be enhanced and how decay of learning can be minimized, (b) whether feedforward
auditory-motor learning also drives updates in feedback control policies, (c) which theoretical insights can be
gained from the subset of individuals who are “followers” and paradoxically use a control strategy that leads to
increasing auditory error rather than adaptation, and (d) whether, at the neural level, cerebellar and basal
ganglia circuits play a distinct role in speech auditory-motor learning versus other forms of speech motor
learning. The inclusion of experiments on the neural bases of auditory-motor learning leverages state-of-the-art
sensing technology available in very recent Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) implants with electrodes in either
thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (receiving cerebellar output) or subthalamic nucleus (basal ganglia).
Overall, these integrated experiments will elucidate the processes, mechanisms, and neural substrates
involved in speech auditory-motor learning. They will also reveal the developmental progression of auditory-
motor learning, differences in auditory-motor learning between children and adults, as well as similarities and
differences in speech sensorimotor learning vs. limb sensorimotor learning. Furthermore, given that auditory-
motor adaptation paradigms cause speakers to implicitly alter their speech output quickly and without effort,
this line of work supports the future long-term goal of developing novel, computer-assisted clinical procedures
that induce adaptive changes in speech behavior by systematically altering the speaker’s auditory feedback.
Thus, the work is directly relevant to public health as the generated knowledge will deepen our understanding

Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by myeloid cell
differentiation defects and dysplastic blood cell production. The majority of MDS patients die of disease related
causes, with infection or infectious complications being the most common cause. While it is known that myeloid
cells exhibit functional defects in MDS patients, the extent and cause of these defects remain unclear and the
corresponding effects on host defense have received limited study. With the advent of next-generation
sequencing technology, analysis of somatically-acquired mutations in patient samples has become a normal
part of clinical practice in MDS patients. Interestingly, the most common class of mutations found in MDS
patients are mutations in various components of the spliceosome. We have determined that these MDS-
associated spliceosome gene mutations lead to alterations in innate immune signaling pathways and
compromise the function of myeloid cells in mouse models of spliceosome-mutated MDS. This leads to a
significant defect in host defense. Based on these preliminary studies, we have hypothesized that MDS
patients with spliceosome mutations are at an increased risk of infection because of immune dysfunction in
their myeloid cells. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate the effects of spliceosome mutations on host
defense using: (1) ex vivo studies with mouse and human neutrophils, (2) ex vivo studies with mouse and
human macrophages, and (3) in vivo studies in mice expressing mutant spliceosome genes and in an analysis
of clinical data from patients with MDS. These studies will determine the mechanisms underlying host defense
defects in MDS patients with spliceosome mutations and will provide important clinical data about patient risk
stratification."

The human immune system is capable of eliminating nearly any type of infectious agent; however, in many cases
it must be “instructed” how to recognize specific pathogens. Bacteria have evolved means of evading aspects
of immunity by cloaking themselves in polymeric sugars (glycans), and the first interactions between bacteria
and the immune system involve these glycans. While this cloaking mechanism can protect bacteria from potent
immune responses, it can also be an exploitable weakness. Our collaborative group, borrowing on work from
many pioneering scientists, has developed means of using this cloaking mechanism to “instruct” the immune
system to selectively target specific types of bacteria. In this Project, we are preparing the specific instructions
for adaptive immunity, which will result in production of highly specific antibodies for the targeted bacteria. The
targeted bacteria include some of the most prevalent and dangerous human pathogens, including drug-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In this project, we are investigating
how antibodies recognize specific sections of the polymeric glycans produced by bacteria. This investigation
involves preparation of individual sections of the glycans, comprised of two, three or four sugars. From these
sections, vaccines will be generated that will trigger production of high-affinity antibodies for each individual
section. These antibodies will be evaluated for how well they bind to the polymeric glycan and to intact bacteria
and how well these antibodies function in promoting elimination the targeted bacteria by the immune system.
From information generated by the study of the performance of antibodies generated to specific sections of the
polymeric glycan, we will learn which portions of the glycan can be bound by antibodies and how large of section
provides the strongest and most selective binding. Outcomes of this research include an understanding the size
and nature of bacterial glycans that can be used for vaccine generation and for the development of high-affinity
antibodies that will provide a means of treating bacterial infections."
10839313,"ABSTRACT Project 2: University of Delaware - Grimes
The P01 entitled Multidimensional development of high-affinity anti-glycan antibodies to fight deadly
bacterial infections aims to develop novel strategies to combat bacterial infections. The whole project grant
aims to develop therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of bacterial resistant infections. Project 2, entitled
“Probing the role of peptidoglycan modification in the antibody response to Staphylococcus aureus” will focus on
bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus is typically treated with penicillin or glycopeptides;
however precedent resistant stains to both classes of antibiotics have emerged. As such, the World Health
Organization has placed it on the priority list for new antibiotics. Project 2 will focus on the synthesis of bacterial
peptidoglycan (PGN) fragments from Staphylococcus aureus, with a strong emphasis on two modifications used
by Sa to modify PGN: acetylation and wall teichoic acids (WTA). As the bacterial cell wall and peptidoglycans
are critical to human health it represents an excellent antibody target: humans do not have these cell walls and
they are essential to bacteria. The modified peptidoglycan fragments from S. aureus synthesized in the project
will provide the biologically relevant fragments necessary to produce, characterize and validate the clinically
relevant antibodies throughout this entire project."
10890578,"PROJECT SUMMARY—Data Management and Biostatistics Core (Core C)
This Data Management and Biostatistics Core: Core C (Data/Stats Core) is designed to provide high-quality data
management infrastructure and statistical support, while using innovation and creativity to improve the delivery
of our core functions to investigators. Historically, this PPG has always used sophisticated approaches for
phenotyping patients and has prioritized the goal of linking complex clinical syndromes back to neuroanatomic,
genetic, and proteomic signatures to improve the early and accurate diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
We aim to apply the rich clinical, imaging, molecular, and neuropathological information that we gather on each
participant to bridge the knowledge gaps that impede therapeutic discovery in FTD. Thus, the Data/Stats Core
for this PPG has a particular mandate to support and facilitate our researchers’ synthesis of complex, multilevel
data and to approach that data with appropriately sophisticated recommendations for research design and
analytic methods. At the center of the PPG is a comprehensive database built using the LAVA platform, a data
management solution specifically designed at UCSF for use by integrative clinical research centers. It provides
support for administrative, clinical, and research procedures for central cores and affiliated projects that share
common patient cohorts and assessment protocols. In earlier cycles of this PPG, we also developed a suite of
browser-based tools designed to work with PPG data and to help solve the problems posed by the complex,
multidimensional data generated across PPG projects and cores. These tools facilitate single-patient data
integration and normative interpretation across clinical, imaging, specimen, and genetic modalities; visualization
of aggregate patient data; rapid linking of phenotypic and genetic data with structural MRI data; and imaging
analysis. This core is also structured to provide excellent, comprehensive research design and biostatistical
consultation to PPG personnel, guiding researchers with the most appropriate, precise, and innovative statistical
approaches. Thus, the aims of this core are: Aim 1: To develop and maintain centralized, integrated data
management systems and procedures that ensure the accuracy, availability, and confidentiality of administrative,
clinical, and research data from PPG cores and projects. Aim 2: To provide PPG researchers with data integration
and analysis tools supporting their ability to effectively combine and utilize data across cores and projects to
accelerate discovery. Aim 3: To provide high-quality consultation on biostatistical and data science approaches
for all PPG cores and projects in order to systematically unify and focus research design and statistical analysis.
Aim 4: To promote research methods integration and collaboration among PPG cores, projects, and related
research protocols by promoting Open Science principles and establishing cross-team procedures for efficient
sharing of data, models, and code."
10806123,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Delusions are psychotic symptoms that contribute to significant emotional distress, poorer quality of life, functional
impairment, hospitalization and violence. Delusions are treatment-resistant in many patients. Mechanistic understanding
of delusion severity remains elusive, limiting treatment advancement. Abnormal belief updating is a proposed mechanistic
framework of delusions with accumulating evidentiary support. Prior cross-sectional work has demonstrated altered
belief updating ability and associated neurobiological abnormalities in psychotic disorder patients during cognitive tasks.
However, it is unknown whether belief updating abnormalities are state-markers of delusional thinking that change over
time, or represent stable cognitive traits that contribute to delusion-proneness. Answering this question can not only
inform mechanistic models of delusions, but will guide targeted treatment development. This K23 mentored patient-
oriented career development award proposes a longitudinal examination of delusion severity and belief updating in
psychotic disorder patients recovering from an acute episode of psychosis. This project will use computational and
functional neuroimaging (fMRI) approaches to 1) determine how belief updating parameters change throughout six
months of recovery from an acute delusional state, and 2) characterize neurobiological correlates of belief updating
parameters as symptom severity changes. The applicant is a licensed clinical psychologist with a background in using
neuropsychological tasks and neuroimaging techniques to understand cognitive deficits across the psychosis spectrum.
Her long-term career goal is to build an independent research program that employs sophisticated cognitive neuroscience
techniques to test mechanistic models of psychosis, and then use that knowledge to develop and test novel interventions.
In order to accomplish these short and long-term goals, the applicant requires additional training, as outlined in this
proposal. Training areas include: 1) the computational and cognitive neuroscience of delusions, 2) longitudinal research
design and statistics, and 3) intervention research to prepare the applicant for a translational research career. Training will
include formal coursework, didactics, and on-site trainings, guided under a mentorship team of experts in the longitudinal
cognitive neuroimaging of psychotic disorders, computational modeling of psychotic symptoms, and treatment of
delusions. Mentored training and completion of the proposed project will provide the applicant the skills and experience
necessary to launch a successful independent research career."
10766138,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
 Long-term allograft function tends to be poor for people who receive kidneys from deceased donors, which
comprise 70% of total transplants. A key contributor to these poor outcomes is cold storage (CS) of the organs,
which induces injury during preservation. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms
by which CS activates molecular pathways that induce renal damage in the recipient. Our long-term goal is to
identify these CS-related pathways and apply targeted therapies during CS to improve outcomes and decrease
transplant-associated mortality. One of the important molecular determinants of CS-induced kidney injury is
abnormal protein homeostasis. During stress, heat-shock proteins and the proteasome play a concerted role in
maintaining protein homeostasis. Hsp72 is the major stress-inducible homologue of Hsc70, the cognate member
of the heat-shock protein 70 family that exhibits housekeeping function in all nucleated cells and is necessary
for cell survival. Importantly, Hsc70 and Hsp72 play critical roles by binding damaged proteins and recruiting the
proteasome for targeted degradation, preventing the nonspecific aggregation of damaged proteins. In addition
to its protective roles, Hsp72 is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous human diseases by modulating the
immune system and inflammation. Using a clinically relevant rat model of renal CS combined with
transplantation, we showed that CS decreases proteasome function and impairs protein homeostasis in the
transplants. How CS decreases proteasome function in the transplants is not known. We hypothesize that CS-
mediated activation of HSF1 and p38MAPK mediate the upregulation of Hsp72 and phosphorylation of Rpt6,
leading to proteasome dysfunction and injury after transplantation. We have preliminary data supporting this
hypothesis. We have also established animal models of CS/transplantation, which mimic the clinical reality more
effectively than simple CS/warm perfusion and will allow us to test our hypothesis through 3 specific aims. Aim
1: Define the mechanism of Hsp72 upregulation and its impact on proteasome dysfunction during renal CS and
transplantation. Aim 2: Delineate the mechanism of Rpt6 phosphorylation/aggregation and its impact on
proteasome dysfunction during renal CS and transplantation. Aim 3: Determine the therapeutic utility of the
Hsp72 inhibitor HS-72 using both rat and human models of renal CS and transplantation. This project uses a
clinically relevant rat kidney transplant model as well as ex vivo human kidney perfusion pump to test the effects
of novel CS-based therapies (e.g., HS-72) on proteasome/renal function after transplantation. We expect to
identify molecular mediators of proteasome dysfunction and renal injury following CS and transplantation. These
findings would be readily translatable, such as by administering drugs targeting these pathways to the CS
solution to improve transplant outcomes and reduce mortality for transplant patients with end-stage kidney
disease."

 The goals of the WashU-Northwestern Genomic Variation and Function Data and Administrative
Coordinating Center (IGVF-DACC) component of the IGVF Consortium are to collect, store, curate, and display
all data, metadata, and analysis tools generated by the IGVF Consortium. The DACC will assist in developing
and disseminating metadata and standards to be adopted by the community at large, approaches for integrative
analysis of a wide range of data types, and visualization and analysis tools to facilitate access and understanding
of complex datasets to non-expert users. Ultimately, the IGVF Consortium will produce tools, analyses, models,
and data that form the catalog of variants and their functional impact. We will develop the DACC into a substantial
service organization allowing scientific research to take full advantage of the IGVF reference catalog or map. To
support the IGVF Consortium, we will establish databases with an application framework to facilitate complex
data loading. We will include detailed experimental descriptions and metadata. We will define and develop
pipelines that connect all Consortium members to the data and create avenues of access that distribute the data
to the greater biological research community. We will establish metadata requirements, controlled vocabularies,
standardized data formats, and quality control metrics for all IGVF data. We will bring together laboratories that
generate complex data types via experimental assays with laboratories that integrate these data using
computational tools to define the effects of genomic variation on genome function and how these effects shape
phenotypes. By creating structures and data flow pipelines for the verification and validation of all data and
providing processes for the documentation of metadata, the DACC will enhance the IGVF data production. The
DACC will also coordinate integrative data analysis by creating and adapting analysis pipelines and developing
advanced Genome Browser functions for the visual integration of IGVF data. Also, we will make the IGVF Web
Portal that will be the primary entry point to the wealth of experimental data and computational analyses. The
Portal will integrate these data resources and make them available via enhanced search and browsing
capabilities. Finally, the DACC will provide documentation, training, and outreach via many media, including
written documentation, video tutorials, online books, webinars, and meeting workshops and presentations."
10848199,"Internalizing problems, most prominently anxiety and depressive disorders, affect 400 million people globally.
Rooted in childhood, there is a sharp rise in these disorders during the transition to adolescence.
Environmental influences on mental health risk begin in utero. The fetal brain is particularly plastic, thus
prenatal exposures may have greater effects on lifetime mental health compared to later exposures. Metals
remain a public health concern as even low-level exposures typical in the US can disrupt CNS development,
especially during the fetal period. Longitudinal studies on the role of prenatal metal exposures in emerging
mood and anxiety disorders are sparse. Moreover, studies on metal neurotoxicity largely consider one
chemical at a time. The National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has prioritized the need
to examine health effects of chemical mixtures, as well as the joint effects of chemical and social stressors, to
better reflect real-life exposure scenarios and inform more refined policies to protect the public. Learning and
intellectual performance are complex processes that integrate with behavioral traits and cognitive processes
over development to shape psychological health. Metal toxicity disrupts brain regions and functional
connectivity implicated across a number of transdiagnostic (TD) features of disordered emotional states.
Metals and psychosocial stress disrupt similar but not completely overlapping processes that may be involved,
thus they can interact in complex ways. We leverage an ongoing pregnancy cohort with extensive prenatal
metal and stress exposure data, placental molecular signaling biomarkers, and transdiagnostic measures
across infancy and childhood with follow-up to age 9-11 years proposed herein, to more comprehensively
elucidate the role of in utero metals and stress exposures in the programming of internalizing problems
emerging in preadolescence. We will consider transdiagnostic (TD) dimensional factors across select
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) including (1) negative valence systems, (2) cognitive systems, and (3)
arousal/regulation. We use placental-derived microRNA data and physiological stress responsivity
(hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nervous system) in infancy to test for biological mechanistic
pathways that underlie links between prenatal metals and psychiatric vulnerability across childhood and
adolescence. The focus on dimensional assessments of risk factors, mediators, and psychopathological
outcomes broadens the applicability of the findings, particularly given the recognized comorbidity at the clinical
level and the high rate of anxiety and depressive problems at the subclinical level in the general population as
well as in youth specifically. Explicating modifiable environmental risk factors and early biomarkers of risk so
that interventions can be applied early to promote optimal development may have significant implications for
prevention of chronic psychopathology."

The Clinical Research/REproductive Scientist Training Program (CREST) has trained 88 physician scientists in
the conduct of clinical research, has enabled these physicians to participate in multicenter clinical trials and
secondary data analyses, and has helped further their careers and create a cadre of leaders in Obstetrics and
Gynecology. Didactic training in biostatistical methodology is combined with a hands-on mentored team
science project (MTSP) to guide Scholars through the data analysis and publication process. Throughout the
program, mentorship and networking are emphasized to provide early career interactions with academic
societies within their specialties and pathways to leadership. CREST Scholars have produced a total of
1,874 unique peer-reviewed publications since the start of the program in 2005. Specific aims of the
current proposal will build upon past successes to: 1. Train the Reproductive Medicine workforce to meet
the national need for clinical research. It is more critical than ever to educate trainees in clinical research
and apply these principles to clinical practice. We shall continue to train up to 6 Scholars per year. 2. Promote
diversity in the biomedical research workforce by recruiting and training Scholars who are
underrepresented in Medicine (URiM) and equipping them for success. We shall improve our data
capture and followup of URiMs recruited to CREST and apply best practice to welcome new URiM candidates
to the program. 3. Provide ‘holistic’ mentoring for Scholars extending to their home institutions. We
shall identify an experienced, senior faculty member who will provide one-on-one support for each Scholar’s
research experience as well as longer term mentoring beyond the program’s 2-year time frame. By building
upon our programmatic strengths and extending the reach of our mentoring protocols, we plan to continue our
exceptional success in preparing for the future of the field. CREST has trained 7 academic Division Chiefs in
Ob/Gyn, one department Chair, and two Presidents of the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and
Infertility to date, along with multiple committee members of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine."
10746442,"ABSTRACT
Mastectomy is performed on approximately half of women with breast cancer. Postmastectomy breast
reconstruction has benefits for body image, sexuality, self-esteem, and quality of life. Poor clinical prognoses
after breast reconstruction often involve mastectomy skin flap necrosis (MSFN) or other complications
associated with the lack of blood flow and oxygenation to wound tissue volumes. MSFN and wound dehiscence
leads to a number of challenges, including wound management problems, delays to adjuvant therapy, esthetic
compromise, implant extrusion, patient distress, and financial loss. A technology that allows surgeons to
perioperatively assess and optimize preservation of skin flaps while avoiding complications is essential to ensure
successful clinical outcomes. Although alternative techniques have been explored to identify ischemic-hypoxic
tissues at risk of necrosis, none have achieved universal acceptance as each technique has a few challenging
issues that decrease its clinical usefulness. Moreover, no single technique provides both blood flow and
oxygenation information, which are essential for precise assessment of skin flap viability. Our recent innovative
development of near-infrared speckle contrast diffuse correlation tomography (scDCT) technique provides a
noninvasive (dye-free) and noncontact means for continuous 2D/3D imaging of blood flow distributions
throughout large/thick tissue volumes such as mastectomy skin flaps. We propose to extend this scDCT
prototype to a next generation multi-wavelength scDCT (MW-scDCT) device for perioperative imaging of both
blood flow and oxygenation distributions in mastectomy skin flaps. New high-speed algorithms for 2D mapping
and 3D image reconstruction will be developed to accommodate rapid online assessment of skin flap
hemodynamics. This MW-scDCT system will be tested/optimized using standard tissue-simulating phantoms
(Aim 1) and calibrated/validated against a commercial dye-based fluorescence angiography device (SPY Elite®)
in swine (Aim 2) and patients (Aim 3) undergoing mastectomy with expander-implant based breast
reconstruction. The in vivo studies will determine the capability of our MW-scDCT for intraoperative prediction of
MSFN regions/volumes and postoperative optimization of incremental expander volumes to reduce risks of
MSFN and other complications. We expect that combined measurements of preoperative baseline and
intraoperative alteration in skin flap flow and oxygenation will provide a more accurate assessment of skin flap
viability than a one-time single-parameter measurement (i.e., blood flow, blood oxygenation, or fluorescence
perfusion). Study outcomes will provide the rationale for designing MW-scDCT guided clinical trials of
mastectomy with breast reconstruction to reduce postoperative complications and healthcare costs. Moreover,
this noninvasive (dye-free), noncontact, continuous, and cost-efficient imaging system has the potential for
perioperative use in many other clinical settings, especially where contact measurements may not be possible,
such as for continual and longitudinal monitoring of burns, wounds, and other types of tissue flaps."
10788388,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death, accounting for ~30% of all injury deaths in America,
with over 2 million Americans acquiring some form of TBI. Approximately 20% of current service members
have experienced some form of TBI. Many recent injuries have come in the form of exposures to blast from
improvised explosive devices. Blast TBI triggers an activation of the immune system, generation of auto-
antibodies, as well as infiltration of circulating immune cells into the central nervous system (CNS). These
mechanisms occur in the brain as well as the retina. However, the individual role of cellular and humoral
immunity causing neuron loss has not been thoroughly dissected. This proposal will define the role of auto-
antibodies and circulating immune cells on the progression of blast-mediated visual loss in order to identify
mechanisms that are amenable to therapy.
The overall goal of this study is to determine which components of the immune response are necessary and
sufficient to cause neuronal dysfunction and loss after blast-mediated TBI.
Our central hypothesis is that blast-mediated traumatic brain injury activates cellular and humoral immune
responses that lead to increased chronic neurodegeneration after TBI.
Understanding how immune cells, autoantibodies, and complement protein affect eyes exposed to blast
represents a critical knowledge gap. Our study should reveal novel therapeutic approaches utilizing drugs
already approved for clinical use that can be immediately translated to benefit Veteran’s health."

historically been a stabilizing institution in the City, and is now at the forefront of the revitalization taking place
in the region. WSU is committed to driving this growth, and over the last 5 years has recruited over 50 new
faculty members in the sciences alone. New faculty are drawn to WSU for various reasons, including the
diversity of the region, the exceptional facilities, and the success of our faculty, as evidenced in part by a 30%
increase in federal funding since 2014. WSU is well-positioned to request continued support for its successful
IMSD program, now transitioning from a R25 to a T32, at the level of 10 graduate students. The goal of the
WSU program is to provide targeted training and mentoring that is individualized to meet the needs of a
diverse body of graduate students to facilitate successful completion of their Ph.D. degrees. Ultimately, these
IMSD students will develop careers in the biomedical sciences, and will go on to serve as mentors to future
generations. Trainees will be selected in their first or second year of graduate study and supported for up to
two years. The IMSD T32 program will continue to focus on developing and enhancing academic skills and
professional career development. IMSD graduate students are integrated into our learning community, and
remain active throughout their entire training at WSU, with enhanced opportunities for teaching and mentoring.
Specifically, we aim: 1) To provide our graduate students with a structured community to facilitate and enhance
professional bonds that will enable each student to learn, develop, and incorporate the skills necessary for a
successful future in biomedical careers; 2): To provide a program to enhance individual academic program
success coupled with mentored research; and 3): To provide opportunities for peer-to-peer mentoring, near-
peer mentoring, and undergraduate teaching experiences in our learning community. These activities are
intended to provide opportunities for IMSD student trainees to develop skills in presentation, teaching, and
mentoring that will not only maintain their focus on career goals, but also develop professional skills that they
will utilize in their future research/academic careers. We propose to build on the successes of our long-
established IMSD program with modifications based on an evolving demographic and social culture of our
students. This IMSD program will provide academic development and research experience at a large, urban,
research institution with a very diverse student population to a more personal level for our trainees."
10839285,"Bioinorganic Chemistry of Nitrogen
 The long-term goal of the PI’s research program is to understand how biology uses transition metals to
control the speciation of redox-active substrates including reactive or “fixed” nitrogen species (RNS). Reactive
nitrogen species serve vital roles in biology. For example, nitric oxide (NO) is a cellular signaling agent that
regulates vasodilation in mammalian systems. In a separate context, nitrate (NO3–) can substitute for dioxygen
(O2) as the terminal electron acceptor during cellular respiration by bacteria that include human pathogens.
This proposal describes a continuation of efforts to elucidate mechanisms of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle
via the study of metalloenzymes as well as model complexes that interconvert RNS. A key knowledge gap that
will be addressed through proteomics and enzymology concerns the means by which ammonia oxidizing
archaea derive chemical energy from the oxidation of hydroxylamine. The operative enzyme and the product of
this reaction remain unknown. Activity guided purification and mass spectrometry will furnish the identity of this
globally proliferated nitrogen cycle protein for subsequent characterization by spectroscopy, X-ray
crystallography, and kinetics. Further work will explore product selectivity in RNS oxidation biochemistry by
heme P460 proteins to determine how NO is selected over nitrous oxide (N2O) to differentiate metabolic from
detoxification proteins. The PI will continue to collaborate with leading bioinorganic chemists to understand
how transition metals prime RNS for oxidation or reduction and how selectivity in these reactions is achieved.
These collaborations will leverage the PI’s expertise in X-ray spectroscopic as well as in other inorganic
spectroscopies. Key examples of these collaborations involve site-selective spectroscopic probing of metal
atoms in the FeMo cofactor of nitrogenase, the means by which multicopper clusters reduce N2O, and studying
the electronic structures and reactivities of Lewis-acid stabilized RNS that have been rendered capable of
undergoing redox transformations independent of proton transfer."
10811607,"ABSTRACT: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can lead to a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and health deficits
falling under the umbrella of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). FASD is estimated to affect 2-7% of
children in the USA and 23% worldwide. Importantly, people with FASD have much higher rates of mental
health problems than the general population. In particular, up to 50% of people with FASD suffer from
depression, making it one of the most prevalent mental illnesses linked to PAE. Although the biological
mechanisms underlying this increased vulnerability remain unknown, DNA methylation (DNAm) – a type of
epigenetic modification – has emerged as a prime candidate to explain the long-term effects of PAE and its
links to depression. However, most human studies of PAE and its effects on DNAm and depression are cross-
sectional, and thus, have not investigated if the timing of PAE influences these relationships. Here, we propose
to determine the extent to which the timing of PAE influences DNAm and depressive symptoms in childhood
and adolescence, as well as assess the role of DNAm in mediating the link between PAE and increased
depression risk. We will analyze data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a
longitudinal birth cohort that collected repeated, prospective measures of PAE during pregnancy, DNAm and
genetic data, and measures of depression collected almost yearly from age 4 to 16.5. We will replicate findings
in Generation R (GenR), a longitudinal birth cohort with similar metrics to ALSPAC from children followed for
17 years. In Aim 1, we will assess the extent to which the timing of PAE influences parent-reported, child
depressive symptom trajectories from age 4 to 16.5. Trajectories will be characterized using growth mixture
modeling with structured residuals, a method we previously used to identify six classes of depression
trajectories in ALSPAC. Causal relationships will be tested through Mendelian Randomization and negative
control analyses (i.e., partner drinking in pregnancy). In Aim 2, we will identify the DNAm patterns at birth that
are influenced by the timing of PAE and determine the extent to which these DNAm profiles mediate, or
partially explain, the relationship between PAE and depressive symptom trajectories using statistical mediation
methods. Both aims leverage a two-stage structured life course modeling approach previously used by our
team to identify age periods when early-life exposures have greater effects on DNAm and depression. In sum,
this study will identify: (1) periods when PAE has larger effects on depressive symptoms and DNAm; (2)
specific patterns of depression in childhood and adolescence driven by PAE; and (3) epigenetic alterations that
link PAE to depression. These findings will highlight developmental windows and biological mechanisms that
could be targeted in interventions that reduce depression risk among people with FASD and maximize their
well-being. The proposed research will also generate preliminary evidence towards future grant applications
focused on socio-biological factors that link PAE to mental health across the life course."

10778541,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuronal activity actively modulates local cerebral vasculature. This neuro-vascular interaction is the foundation
of imaging studies of human brain function in health and disease. These studies are routinely performed while
subjects perform tasks (evoked activity) or lie resting (task-free or resting-state activity), and they assume that
imaging signals loyally reflect local neuronal activity. However, the neuro-vascular signaling mechanism is
complex and instances of uncoupling have been reported, limiting the interpretability of these studies. Recent
reports have shown that different types of neurons can regulate local blood supply stronger than others,
especially inhibitory neurons. These findings underscore the need to understand the vaso-regulatory roles of
different neuronal populations, especially considering that neurological disorders have been associated with
dysfunction of specific inhibitory neuron sub-populations. The goal of this proposal is to determine the role of
different sub-populations of inhibitory neurons on the regulation of local blood flow during evoked stimulation as
well as during resting-state activity periods. Experiments will be performed using unique transgenic mouse
models. In addition, we will determine whether these findings generalize over different cortical regions and
explore the translatability of these findings to human subjects by comparing the distribution of inhibitory neurons
that strongly regulate local blood flow in targeted regions of mouse and human brains. Our group has extensive
multi-modal expertise in neuro-vascular (and neuro-metabolic) physiology, including the models and techniques
proposed, and we are uniquely positioned to successfully complete the aims of this project. We will achieve
these goals through three aims: (Aim 1) Determine which inhibitory neuron sub-types strongly regulate local
blood flow changes evoked by optogenetic stimulation in different cortical regions; (Aim 2) Determine whether
the same sub-population of inhibitory neurons regulate local blood flow changes during ongoing awake activity
periods; and (Aim 3) Determine whether the sub-populations of inhibitory neurons identified in Aims 1 and 2 are
similarly distributed across the targeted regions of mouse and human brains. Since inhibitory neurons shape
network activity, these studies will detail the impact of specific inhibitory neuronal sub-type function and
dysfunction on local blood supply and hemodynamic-based imaging signals, expanding the interpretability and
clinical utility of human brain imaging studies in health and disease."
10812989,"Abstract: Over the past two decades, the incidence of colorectal cancer among adults < 50 years of age (i.e.,
early-onset CRC) has been alarmingly and steadily increasing. Despite these increases, survivorship care has
evolved slowly and remains poorly informed and of suboptimal quality. Patients with early-onset CRC are
particularly vulnerable to suboptimal care, given that the disease is more often diagnosed in racial and ethnic
minorities and at a stage in life when financial instability and being medically underinsured or uninsured are
more common. Thus, there is a critical need to design a model of survivorship care that aligns: 1) the intensity
of surveillance with actual risk of recurrence; and 2) the provision of care services with need. Stratified
survivorship care pathways provide an opportunity to deliver patient-centered, high-quality care that is
appropriately tailored to individual needs. However, these pathways currently do not exist for patients with
early-onset CRC, which is in part due to the lack of population-based estimates of recurrence that can guide
surveillance approaches and the dearth of knowledge regarding these patients’ unique survivorship care
burdens and needs. In this proposal, we will partner with three SEER registries in Georgia, Kentucky, and Los
Angeles County to apply a new methodology to identify patterns of recurrence among patients with stage I-III
early-onset CRC, generate population-level estimates of risk of recurrence, and examine clinical and
sociodemographic factors associated with recurrence risk (Aim 1). We will then survey a contemporary and
diverse SEER-based cohort of patients diagnosed with early-onset CRC to assess patients’ receipt of
surveillance and self-reported survivorship care needs across multiple domains (e.g., physical symptoms,
financial issues, family planning) (Aim 2). Finally, informed by findings from Aims 1 and 2, we will develop a
stratified survivorship care framework and care pathways with a multi-disciplinary Advisory Panel (Aim 3). We
will engage patients, caregivers, and clinician stakeholders in a consensus panel using the RAND/UCLA
Appropriateness Method to refine and finalize the stratified survivorship care framework and care pathways.
We will then assess the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility among the stakeholders. This study will
yield much-needed population-based estimates of recurrence risk, surveillance intensity, and
survivorship care needs and generate stratified survivorship care pathways for this rapidly growing
population of cancer survivors. The findings have the potential to meaningfully improve the quality of
survivorship care for patients with early-onset CRC and advance the science of stratified survivorship care
delivery for other cancers more broadly."

 Parasitic flatworms, such as tapeworms, have global reach and cause a wide variety of symptoms from
intestinal distress and lethargy to organ failure, seizures, and even death. These parasites have complex life
cycles and a remarkable capacity for growth, reproduction, regeneration, and longevity. These physiological
traits are enabled by stem cells, thus understanding stem cell behaviors and regulation in these parasites has
the capacity to uncover a broad range of potential targets that can be exploited for future drug development. My
foundational work establishing the rat tapeworm, Hymenolepis diminuta, as a tractable modern model organism
and my initial characterization of stem cells and regeneration in this system make it ideal for this study. My goal
is to elucidate stem cell-driven regeneration and reproduction in this tapeworm. I seek to discover the signals
that regulate stem cell potency and enable regeneration of tapeworm proglottids, which are each a functional
reproductive unit. To this end, I will identify subpopulations of stem cells and functionally assay for pluripotent
potential using innovative cell isolation and transplantation methodologies. I have previously shown that
microenvironmental signals that regulate regenerative ability are anteriorly biased. Thus, I will undertake high-
throughput gene expression screening and RNA interference by targeting factors that are polarized along the
anterior-posterior axis across the regeneration-competent tapeworm neck. Furthermore, I will functionally identify
genetic regulators of the germline lineage and investigate the potential plasticity of germ cells, as well as their
coordination with mechanisms that govern proglottid regeneration. These innovative studies exploit the natural
progression of parasite development to make genetic discoveries and take a stem cell-centric approach to
illuminate parasite biology. This is significant as I will be able to make fundamental discoveries in both stem and
germ cell biology, as well as in a greater disease-relevant context."
10764324,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most prevalent and serious birth defects, occurring in over 1% of
live births. Major subsets of congenital heart defects are defective septation of the atria or ventricles, and
conduction system defects, which often co-exist within an individual. The molecular and cellular basis of
congenital heart defects remains poorly understood, and an understanding is necessary to develop new
diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. The genetic basis of human CHD is largely from dominant mutations
in transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin-modifying factors, resulting in their reduced dosage. How
reduced dosage of a transcriptional regulator translates to altered genomic function is not known, nor is it
known how these altered gene regulatory networks then disrupt heart development to cause CHDs. TBX5 is
a T-box TF, haploinsufficiency of which causes heart defects associated with Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS).
We have developed an induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell model of HOS, and in parallel, we have studied a
new mouse model of TBX5-dependent CHD. Based on strong preliminary data including single cell
RNAseq, we propose a project aimed at elucidating the molecular basis of TBX5-dependent gene
regulatory networks in the formation of CHDs. We hypothesize that TBX5 dosage in specific, vulnerable cell
populations in the developing heart, drives gene regulatory networks that control finely regulated cellular
behaviors, with consequences for cardiac development. We will test this hypothesis by elucidating the
genomic dysregulation that results from TBX5 haploinsufficiency in a human iPSC model of CHD, and the
genetic and cellular defects in the cells that define the interventricular septum boundaries in a mouse model
of TBX5 haploinsufficiency in vivo. The proposed experiments, based on single cell transcriptomics and
epigenomics, will provide exciting new insights into the molecular events that lead to common CHD. We
propose three specific aims. Aim 1 is todefine disrupted gene regulatory networks in discrete cell
populations in a human cell model of CHD, using an allelic series of TBX5, which includes heterozygous
and homozygous null iPS cell lines, and single cell RNAseq and ATACseq. Aim 2 is to identify epigenomic
mechanisms for TBX5 haploinsufficiency by examining in our TBX5 allelic series chromatin occupancy of
TBX5 and its TF partners, chromatin remodeler, and histone modifications. Aim 3 is to delineate the genetic
and cellular basis for Tbx5 haploinsufficiency in interventricular septum progenitors in vivo by single cell
RNAseq and ATACseq using lineage labeled interventricular septum cardiomyocytes, combined with spatial
transcriptomics. These results will reveal in vivo gene regulatory networks dysregulated in CHD. The major
impact of the proposed work will be important mechanistic insights into CHDs, and broadly generalizable
mechanisms of transcription factor dosage-sensitive gene regulation."

Now in its 13th year, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium is perhaps the most innovative and productive
experiment in the history of psychiatry. The PGC unified the field and attracted a cadre of outstanding
scientists (802 investigators from 157 institutions in 41 countries). PGC work has led to identification of ~500
genetic loci in the 11 psychiatric disorders we study. Our work has led to 320 papers, many in high-profile
journals (Nature 3, Cell 5, Science 2, Nat Genet 27, Nat Neurosci 9, Mol Psych 37, Biol Psych 25). As
summary statistics are freely available, psychiatric disorders often feature prominently in papers by non-PGC
investigators. To advance discovery and impact, we propose to continue the work of the PGC across 11
disorder groups. Considerable new data are coming in the next five years. We thus can rapidly and efficiently
increase our knowledge of the fundamental basis of major psychiatric disorders.
Aim 1: we will continue to advance genetic discovery for severe psychiatric disorders in all working groups,
systematically interface with large biobank studies to ensure maximal comparability, and aggressively promote
new studies of individuals with psychiatric disorders from diverse ancestries to increase discovery and improve
fine-mapping. Aim 2: most studies analyze common variation (Aim 1), rare CNV (Aim 2), and rare
exome/genome resequencing results (via collaboration) in isolation: we will apply an integrative framework to
rigorously evaluate the contributions of all measured types of genetic variation on risk for psychiatric disorders.
Aim 3: we will move beyond classical case-control definitions to a more biologically-based and nuanced
understanding by enabling large trans-diagnostic studies, convene trans-disciplinary teams to use genetics to
address unresolved questions about the nature of psychiatric disorders, and to promote large studies of the
severest cases seen in psychiatric practice (leveraging the global reach of PGC investigators). Aim 4: we will
work to maximize the impact of our work via translational efforts: close collaborations with neuroscience
consortia to understand the biological implications of our findings; work to identify modifiable causal risk
factors; and work to robustly predict clinical outcomes and identify patient subsets. Aim 5: we will increase
impact of our work by extending and formalizing outreach to different communities (including pharma and
biotech), via digital media (Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia), and by developing, distributing, and updating
resources/educational material for patients, families, and medical professionals. We will convene a Scientific
Advisory Board to ensure we respond positively to those invested in our results
Successful completion of this body of work will greatly advance knowledge of the genetic basis of psychiatric
disorders with potentially major nosological and treatment implications. These goals are consistent with a core
mission of the NIMH, and the central idea of the PGC: to convert the family history risk factor into biologically,
clinically, and therapeutically meaningful insights."
10791851,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of novel therapies for the treatment of breast cancer is a major unmet need. In recent years,
immune checkpoint inhibitors including anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 have shown promise as
antitumor agents, and are approved for the treatment of several malignancies. Clinical trials in breast cancer
patients have shown that about 20% of triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) respond favorably to anti-PD-1
antibodies and Atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody in combination with
nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane)
is now
FDA approved for advanced stage TNBC patients with positive PDL-1 expression. However, many TNBC
patients are resistant to anti-PD-1/PDL-1 and anti-CTLA-4 treatments which could be due to weak
immunogenicity of the tumors and poor inflammatory but highly immune suppressive tumor microenvironment.
In recent years TGFβ has been shown to be a strong immune suppressor and can potentially produce a tumor
microenvironment that is resistant to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. To overcome resistance to anti-PD-1
and anti-CTLA-4 we have developed adenoviruses (Ad) expressing sTGFβRIIFc (soluble TGFβ receptor II
fused with human IgG Fc). sTGFβRIIFc acts as a TGFβ decoy, and can inhibit TGFβ pathways. Initially, we
created Ad5 based Ad.sT expressing sTGFβRIIFc. To reduce hepatic/systemic toxicity associated with
systemic delivery of Ad.sT, we created mHAd.sT, a liver-detargeted virus, by replacing hypervariable regions
(HVRs) (1-7) of Ad.sT with Ad48 HVRs. To enhance tumor specificity, we have now created mHAdLyp.sT by
introducing LyP-1 peptide, a 9-amino acid long tumor homing-cell peptide, into the HI loop of the mHAd.sT
fiber. In this proposal, we will test the hypotheses that systemic administration of mHAdLyp.sT in mice bearing
4T1 triple negative mammary tumors will result in reduced hepatic/systemic toxicity but produce high levels of
sTGFβRIIFc and inhibit TGFβ pathways. This will alter the tumor microenvironment, induce tumor immunity,
and overcome resistance to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4., and examine the expression profiles of TGFβ-1,
TGFβ-1 regulated genes, and PD-1 and CTLA-4 signaling pathways. We will examine immuno-phenotypes in
tumors, peripheral blood and spleen (Aim 1). Next, we will examine mHAdLyp.sT, anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4
combination therapies in mouse tumor models. We will conduct RNA-Seq analysis of the whole
transcriptomes, and examine the role of immune activation in mediating the anti-tumor responses (Aim 2). We
will test the hypothesis that systemic administration of mHLypAd.sT, in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-
CTLA-4 in mice with pre-established metastases will be effective (Aim 3). To guide us for the combination
therapy trials with mHAdLyp.sT, anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4, we will examine human TNBC tumors by
Nanostring technology for RNA profiling, and will further examine the TGFβ-1 and other relevant biomarkers
and TILS in human TNBC tumors. We will also screen the human population for the Ad neutralizing antibodies
titers (Aim 4). We believe that our research described here is critical to bring forward our oncolytic virus
mHAdLyp.sT targeting TGFβ in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 for clinical evaluation in TNBC
patients."

Most importantly, we have created TLR delivery nanotherapeutics and find that TLR NPs combined with aCD40,
aPD-1 and aCTL4 (abbreviated as CP4 as in emerging pancreatic cancer studies) efficiently regressed implanted
multisite invasive murine pancreatic tumors. We have developed multiple strategies and are particularly focused
on 18 nm biodegradable, multi-functional particles that combine immune-modulating peptides, targeting peptides
and toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. We specifically included the immune modulating peptide PADRE (T helper
modulation) and mannose (to enhance macrophage uptake) in addition to the TLR7/8 agonist (resiquimod) in
preliminary work. To maximize payload, we built upon biocompatible unimicellar nanoparticles via the
combination of highly efficient esterification and metal-free click reactions and find that the particle metabolites
clear through the kidneys. In our preliminary studies, TLR7/8-nanoparticle treatment combined with CP4
enhanced response in a highly metastatic, multi-site implanted pancreatic cancer model (Kras+/LSL-G12D;
Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx1-Cre model: abbreviated as KPC). New preliminary data indicate that TLR7/8 agonists and
aCD40 each have direct efficacy against pancreatic tumor cells. RNAseq results demonstrate that TLR7/8
agonists and CD40 enhance complementary pathways (C-lectin for CD40 (among others) and TLR/interferon
for TLR agonists). We find that the combination enhances anti-tumor leukocytes, regresses KPC tumors and for
responders, 100% do not grow tumor on re-challenge. By monitoring OX40 expression (a marker of T cell
activation), we demonstrated that unlike other immune modulating approaches involving aCD40, T cells were
activated. We have simultaneously developed the ability to monitor OX40 expression using positron emission
tomography in a noninvasive fashion. Our primary goal in the proposed work is to move the nanotherapy strategy
forward to human translation. As a result, we will evaluate efficacy in models of pancreatic cancer in rodents
and safety in a larger animal model. Further, we will evaluate samples from patients undergoing biopsy for
pancreatic cancer to better characterize the immune environment. We have 2 major goals: 1) the development
of an effective strategy for systemically-administered T cell modulation and 2) combining this with positron
emission tomographic imaging and RNA sequencing to optimize multi-component protocols. Within Aim 1, we
will determine the optimal carrier properties to maximize T cell modulation by 1a) modulating nanoparticle
characteristics and evaluating resulting efficacy, 1b) using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to
quantify accumulation of the systemically-injected NP agonists, and 1c) assessing toxicity through dose
escalation and a large animal study, leading to IND filing. Within Aim 2, develop an imaging and in vitro
assessment strategy for T cell activation by utilizing 2a) OX40 PET imaging and 2b) flow cytometry and
RNAsequencing."
10771128,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for nearly 31,000 deaths annually in the United States alone.
Factors that epigenetically silence an HCC tumor suppressor gene have the potential to promote
tumorigenesis and thus may provide novel drug targets for HCC therapies. Using a genome-scale shRNA
screen, we identified BCL6 as a putative and novel HCC driver gene. BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor with
no previously documented role in HCC development and progression. We found that BCL6 was sufficient to
transform cultured immortalized hepatocytes and promote HCC tumor growth in mouse subcutaneous
xenografts. These oncogenic effects of BCL6 were dependent upon the ability of BCL6 to cause transcriptional
repression because a transcriptional repression activity defective mutant of BCL6 failed to transform
hepatocytes and promote tumor growth in mice. Based on our preliminary results, in this application we will
establish the role of BCL6 as a driver of HCC, determine the mechanism by which BCL6 promotes tumor
growth, and evaluate novel BCL6 targeting small-molecule inhibitors for HCC therapy. In Aim 1, we will
establish the role of BCL6 in initiation and progression of hepatic tumorigenesis using a series of
complementary mouse models that recapitulate characteristic features of HCC, including a mouse model of
liver fibrosis (cirrhosis). This model recapitulates cirrhosis which is a cardinal feature of HCC. Additionally,
based on our preliminary results that BCL6 inhibition in HCC cells increases their probability of getting cleared
by T-cells, we will also use a mouse model with humanized immune system to study the impact of BCL6 in
HCC progression in the context of a functional human immune system. In Aim 2, based upon the results of our
RNA-seq and further follow up analysis, we will determine if epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor HHIP and
the zinc transporter ZIP14 by BCL6 is necessary for it to drive hepatic tumor growth. In Aim 3, we will evaluate
our novel BCL6 inhibitors in pre-clinical mouse models of HCC, including HCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
models for HCC therapeutics. In preliminary experiments, we have developed a novel small-molecule inhibitor
designed to target the BTB domain of BCL6 and thereby disrupt its interaction with its co-repressors SMRT,
NCOR and BCOR. We found that this novel BCL6 inhibitor L2-12019 inhibited the HCC cell growth in culture
and in a human HCC xenograft-based mouse model. In Aim 3 studies, we will rationally design and evaluate
new L2-12019 analogs to improve drug-like properties. The lead analog (with improved potency, selectivity,
stability and solubility) will be tested with L2-12019 in pre-clinical mouse models of HCC and its efficacy will be
compared with existing BCL6 inhibitors. Collectively, the results of the experiments proposed in this application
will elucidate a novel non-genetic druggable pathway that promotes HCC tumor growth and progression and
evaluate a new approach for treating HCC."
10768549,"Summary
Increasingly liberal cannabis policies in the U.S. have been associated with both “replacement”, whereby
cannabis is substituted for alcohol, thus decreasing alcohol use, and “enhancement”, whereby cannabis use
increases alcohol use. These conflicting patterns may be partially explained by the fact that the potency of
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; the main psychoactive cannabinoid in cannabis) in cannabis in the U.S.
varies widely, with legal-market cannabis containing increasingly higher THC potencies. When combined with
alcohol, cannabis may confer either synergistic or mitigating effects on craving, impulsivity, cognitive
impairment and subsequent drinking, likely depending on several factors, including cannabinoid dose and
content. The limited literature in this area has generated conflicting findings; some studies have shown that
THC increases alcohol intake and has synergistic effects on the subjective effects of alcohol, and others have
shown that THC decreases alcohol intake or has no effects on these outcomes. Emerging work also suggests
that alcohol and cannabis exert opposing effects on the digestive, immune, and central nervous systems,
collectively known as the microbiota-gut-brain-axis (MGBA). Alcohol is linked to immune dysfunction and
disturbances in gut microbial species (microbiota), and these MGBA disruptions have been associated with
neurobehavioral AUD symptoms (e.g., craving, impaired control). Conversely, preclinical data suggest that
cannabinoids may confer beneficial effects on aspects of the MGBA. The opposing findings regarding the
effects of cannabis on alcohol use may be partially due to the differential actions of cannabinoids throughout
the MGBA, which need to be better characterized in humans. Thus, the goal of this naturalistic study is to
explore effects of legal-market cannabis on acute and daily alcohol consumption, neurobehavioral AUD
phenotypes and MGBA function in heavy drinkers. We will recruit N=61 heavy drinking, regular users of legal-
market cannabis to complete daily diary measures of alcohol and cannabis use during two 7-day periods (a no-
cannabis period and an ad lib cannabis use period) and undergo two lab sessions; Visit A assesses cognitive
function, impulsivity, craving, alcohol self-administration, MGBA biomarkers and blood-THC levels in the
absence of acute cannabis, and Visit B tests the same outcomes following subjects’ self-administration of their
preferred legal-market cannabis in their homes. The study uses the Mobile Cannabinoid Pharmacology Lab
(an IRB-approved method developed by our team to test acute effects of legal-market cannabis and quantify
blood-THC). The PI, Dr. Karoly, will pursue training aims to broaden her skillset and enable her to develop
expertise in 1) MGBA analysis, 2) cannabinoid pharmacology, and 3) biostatistics. To guide her research and
training, Dr. Karoly has assembled a premiere mentorship team with expertise spanning these domains. She
will be well-supported as she develops the skills and expertise necessary to launch her independent, patient-
oriented, translational program of research focused on novel AUD treatment and harm reduction strategies."
10804721,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The nuclear lamina is physically connected through nuclear envelope proteins to the cytoskeleton by the LINC
complex (linker of nucleoskeleton to cytoskeleton), which spans the nuclear envelope and allows the
transmission of mechanical forces to the nucleus. LINC complex proteins are frequently mutated or dysregulated
in cancer, and some of these mutations have been proposed to be cancer drivers. Yet, how alterations to the
LINC complex might promote cancer development is not known. This application's overarching hypothesis
is that cytoskeletal force transmission to the nucleus is altered in cancer due to driver mutations in LINC proteins
contributing to loss of epithelial polarity, aberrant tissue structure, abnormal gene expression, transformation and
invasive cancer cell migration. The following aims are proposed: Aim 1. Define alterations to LINC complex-
transmitted mechanical stresses in cancer. How the LINC complex transmits mechanical forces to position
the nucleus and integrates tension in normal breast epithelia will be determined. The molecular and physical
mechanisms for nuclear positioning in invasive breast epithelial cancer 3-D migration will be determined. Aim 2.
Determine how the LINC complex contributes to altering the epigenetic organization of the genome
during progression to breast cancer. The extent to which LINC disruption affects spatial partitioning of genes
in the nucleus and heterochromatin organization will be identified; these effects will be correlated with cell
phenotype, gene expression and epigenomic profiles. The requirement for an intact LINC complex for
transformation to malignancy will be examined. The cancer nucleus remains highly understudied, with much to
learn known about the physical principles that govern nuclear positioning, dysmorphia and chromatin
organization, and how altered nuclear stresses contribute to cancer cell dysfunction. The focus of both aims is
on the impact of cytoskeletal stresses transmitted by the LINC complex on gene expression and cell function.
This necessarily requires an integrated understanding of both molecular and physical mechanisms. Extensive
expertise gained in other systems will be coupled with new approaches for measuring forces on the nucleus.
These include a direct force probe to interrogate nuclear mechanical responses in spread, living cells and
nuclear tension sensors for the study of nuclear forces in both cancer and normal cells. Physically-based
computational models will be used to interpret the resulting data. A physical approach will be applied
to characterize the cancer nucleus and generate unique, genome-wide data sets for gene expression
after experimentally altering LINC complex connections to discover the role of the LINC complex in breast
cancer pathogenesis."

Candidate: Nicole DePasquale, PhD, MSPH, is an Assistant Professor at the Duke University School of
Medicine and is fully committed to becoming an independently-funded investigator at the intersection of
family science and disease management. Her long-term career goal is to develop family-centered interventions
that optimize individual and dyadic health and well-being among older patients with chronic disease and their
family care partners. Dr. DePasquale’s multidisciplinary background makes her an ideal candidate to merge
these two largely separate areas of inquiry. Her academic, research, and training experiences to date span the
fields of communication, psychology, sociology, public health, and human development and family studies, and
her research experiences have been both quantitative and qualitative in nature.
Career development and training plan: Dr. DePasquale’s career development and training plan feature a
multidisciplinary mentoring team comprising a general internist/clinical epidemiologist, geriatrician, health
services researcher, biostatistician, social/health psychologist, and board-certified nephrologist. This team will
support her pursuit of activities that address gaps and strengthen under-developed areas in her experience
through a training plan focused on: 1) geriatric nephrology, 2) dyadic disease management, 3) advanced
quantitative and qualitative research methodology, 4) intervention science, and 5) professional and scholarly
development (best research practices, research collaborations, leadership, and grant writing). Additional
resources to foster her career development and facilitate achievement of her training goals include Duke’s
Claude D. Pepper Center; Edward R. Roybal Center; Offices for Faculty Development, Scientific Integrity, and
Research Mentoring; Social Science Research Institute; and Clinical Research Training Program.
Research plan: The proposed research will use different methodological to address the overarching objective of
understanding the ways in which older patients and their family care partners manage the full course of
chronic kidney disease (CKD) together, and how dyadic management affects individual and dyadic health and
well-being: 1) quantify associations between care partner help with CKD self-management and patient self-
management, depressive symptoms, and health-related quality of life over time (secondary data analysis); 2)
investigate the interrelations of dyadic disease appraisal, disease management, and health along the continuum
of CKD progression (primary data collection through interviews); and 3) adapt and test the feasibility of
SHARE for CKD, a care planning intervention to help patient-care partner dyads work together to manage
CKD. The goal of this work is to initiate a shift in focus from individual experiences and outcomes related to
CKD self-management to those of both members of the care dyad, which can then be used to assist research,
clinical care, and health policies in better supporting patients and care partners alike. Findings will provide Dr.
DePasquale with preliminary data to refine her intervention and test its effectiveness in a R01-funded trial."

Despite decades of research and advancement in health care, there are limited doctoral educational programs
that specifically boost the research training for the workforce in the area of substance use (SU) and substance
use disorders (SUDs), particularly with underserved American Indian (AI), Hispanic, and rural populations who
face a number of health disparities.1-6 Racial and ethnic minorities and rural residents often have high rates of
SU and SUDs and experience high rates of poor health outcomes and premature mortality due, in part, to
difficulty accessing evidence-based comprehensive and culturally relevant care.7 Given the need to equip
clinicians and researchers with research skills in SU and SUD interventions and outcomes in health and
behavioral health care settings, our proposed research training program will prepare doctoral-level health
professionals to conduct culturally-centered research to address SU and SUDs in practice settings. With a shift
towards telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for culturally relevant training among health care
professionals is more urgent now than ever. The overall goal of the proposed research and training program,
Culturally Centered Addictions Research Training (C-CART), is to educate clinicians, providers, and doctoral
students in health professions (occupational therapy [OT], physical therapy [PT], counseling, school, & clinical
psychology) in research skills that include culturally-centered practices, related to SU and SUDs which can be
applied in interprofessional practice and diverse settings. The Specific Aims of this project are: Aim 1: Develop
and implement an interprofessional advanced graduate certificate in culturally-centered SU and SUD research
for doctoral students in: a) clinical, counseling, and school psychology, b) OT, c) PT, and d) interdisciplinary
health, as well as doctoral-trained, practicing clinicians in the community; Aim 2: Foster interprofessional and
collaborative teamwork among Scholars from 5 doctoral programs and the students who are clinical care
providers as they develop culturally-centered research projects focused on addressing and curtailing SU and
SUDs among AI, Hispanic, and rural populations being served in health and behavioral health care settings;
Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of the training program through formative and summative evaluation of
learning outcomes, longitudinal tracking of Scholar careers, and documentation of collaborative research
efforts and products developed by students, faculty, and mentors; and Aim 4: Disseminate research products
through Scholar research presentations at an interprofessional conference, submission of peer-reviewed
manuscripts related to program outcomes, completion of capstone research experiences that emerge from the
program, and a website highlighting program achievements."

The development of immunotherapies focused on the surface glycans of bacteria is hypothesized to be a
potential paradigm shift in the fight against life-threatening and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, an emerging and
increasing health concern for which therapeutic options are limited. Our PO1 team will use chemistry to
deconstruct and display bacterial glycan structures on an artificial platform to make them immunogenic and
recognized by the immune system. Immune responses will be analyzed and dissected by bacteriologists, cellular
and structural immunologists to determine the characteristics of what makes a vaccine or an antibody against
glycans effective as an antibiotic and deployable in pre-clinical studies. This program that assembles some of
the world experts in their respective fields is ambitious and intends to pioneer the effort of placing immunotherapy
next to chemotherapy for the treatment of bacterial infections. Our unique combination of chemistry-immunology-
bacteriology-structural biology will provide the necessary mechanistic understanding of what qualifies a vaccine
or an antibody to be effective in immunotherapy. The team is already productive and has published the proofs
of principle of the approach on which the science of this application is based: very high affinity antibodies can be
produced against bacterial glycans exposed at the surface of antibiotic resistant bacteria and are effective at
combating infectious challenges. We will expand our strategy to the surface glycans of three bacterial pathogens
listed by WHO as “critical” or “high” priority: Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Neisseria
gonorrhea. The fundamental knowledge that we will gain from our studies should establish a very detailed
blueprint of the immune recognition of glycans and glycopeptides by the immune system. The integration of the
chemistry, immunology, and structural biology facets of the project directly into the bacteriology and in vivo
models, will identify glycans targets and strategies to initiate pre-clinical studies."

The administrative core of the PO1 will be in charge of optimizing communications between PIs, their
administrations, the members of their labs, the steering committee, and the NIH. In addition, this core will be
administering the financial resources of the consortium by communicating with the offices of sponsored programs
of each participating institution. This multipart organization relies on experienced administrators who efficiently
set up virtual meetings, set and respect deadlines, organize the annual meeting and the annual report to NIH,
and have the initiative to communicate efficiently through email conversations with members of the group. The
Administrative Core (AC) will have four specific tasks, all of them converging to facilitate the communication
between investigators of the group and their staff.
Task 1: Overall organization, coordination of the multi-investigator project and report to NIH.
We have formulated a management plan to facilitate and optimize the six groups involved in the project. The
overall goal of this plan is to make certain that milestones are achieved in a timely manner within the proposed
fiscal plan. Monthly e-meetings will be critical to achieve these goals.
Task 2: Communication with NIH.
For any urgent matter related to the PO1, the P.O. will be contacted directly by phone and/or e-mail. The
Administrative Core Leader will be in charge of all communication with NIH officials.
Task 3: Assemble a consultative External Scientific Advisory Group.
An External Scientific Advisory Group (ESAG) will be assembled and have three members. The ESAG will
participate to our annual meeting and review the Research Plan objectives.
Task 4: Establish and maintain the PO1 Website.
The Website will be designed and put on-line as soon as the notice of award is received. This Website will be
organized for inside and outside access with restrictions for outside users only. This portal will allow us to
communicate and establish collaborations with the wider scientific community.
In addition, for day-to-day communication an internal Slack channel will be created and used to share protocols
and results."
10770362,"We propose to quantify aging- and AD-associated brain and blood metabolic changes through ex vivo and in
vivo multimodality MR measurements in mouse models after an AD-promoting stimuli, anesthesia-surgery,
with-or-without preventive, protective treatments. This approach recognizes that AD onset, pathogenesis and
progression must produce alterations in the overall metabolic status, or metabolomics, of brain and other
organs in AD patients, as compared with normal homeostasis in healthy individuals, and our understanding of
the urgent need to develop non-invasive AD diagnosis tools. In the three proposed Aims, we will (1)
Characterize age-associated metabolomic changes ex vivo using tissues from different brain regions and blood
serum obtained from wild-type and AD mice after administration of anesthesia-surgery stimuli; (2) Develop
multimodality in vivo MR protocols for non-invasive evaluations of age- and AD-associated brain metabolic
changes induced by anesthesia-surgery stimuli; and (3) Investigate the effect of an AD protective intervention
on metabolomic changes after administration of anesthesia-surgery stimuli. The success of this project will
lead us to establish translational protocols that can guide and interpret multimodality in vivo MR imaging results
by obtaining accurate ex vivo MRS, EM, and immunochemistry measurements in the proposed animal models,
and translating these findings into clinical protocols for human AD non-invasive diagnosis."
10773042,"ABSTRACT Tumors deficient in homologous recombination display high levels of copy number variants
(CNVs) including amplifications, deletions, and breakpoints in their genomes. This homologous recombination
deficiency (HRD) phenotype has been associated with pathogenic BRCA mutations in multiple cancers and
can be exploited clinically through a synthetic lethal interaction with agents, such as inhibitors of poly ADP-
ribose polymerase (PARP) and chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFIRINOX, that increase the level of DNA
damage in tumor genomes. Strikingly, subsets of tumors that are wild type for BRCA1 and BRCA2 have shown
similar clinical responses to these agents. Preliminary studies suggest that responder tumors have elevated
numbers of genomic aberrations even in the absence of variants in the BRCA genes or in other mediators of
homologous recombination mediated DNA repair (e.g. PALB2, ATM, and BRIP1). Thus the nature and extent
of these lesions in tumor genomes, regardless of genotype, provides a biomarker for patients who will
respond to DNA damage and repair targeting therapies.
 It is estimated that in 2019, 56,770 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDA) and 45,750 will die from the disease, making PDA the third most common cause of cancer death.
Recent clinical trials have made modest improvements in overall survival. Studies suggest that similar to
other tumors, elevated numbers of chromosomal aberrations define a HRD signature in a subset of PDAs.
A fundamental hypothesis is that this genomic signature predicts those PDA patients likely to respond to
PARP inhibitors and to DNA damaging agents. However PDA biopsies are difficult to characterize due to
complex genomes and heterogeneous cellularity, as cancer cells represent on average only 25% of the cells
within the tumor. Furthermore, biopsies frequently contain multiple neoplastic populations that cannot be
distinguished by morphology based methods. To address these clinical challenges we validated DNA content
based flow sorting of PDA tissues. Our published methods yield highly purified (>95%) samples suitable for
whole genome analyses from a variety of clinical samples. These include both fresh frozen and formalin fixed
paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues with low tumor cell content (<10-20%) and high amounts (>90%) of necrosis
and debris. We have identified PDAs with extensive numbers of interstitial aberrations (IAs) in their genomes
similar to those observed in HRD-positive BRCAmut tumors. Our results suggest that elevated numbers of IAs
correlate with clinical response in PDA. In this study we will establish analytical and processing procedures for
our HRD-IA assay then establish a score that distinguishes HRD+ BRCAmut tumors. We will then exploit
samples treated with FOLFIRINOX to validate the application of our HRD-IA assay to identify those PDA
patients, BRCAmut and BRCAwt, who respond to DNA damage targeting agents. The final phase of this work will
validate our sorting and CNV based HRD-IA assay for CLIA application and clinical use."
10741822,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite the remarkable success of engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in the treatment of B cell
malignancies, their application to solid cancers has been far less successful. One of the major challenges limiting
their utility is the difficulty in identifying ideal surface antigens that can be used to discriminate between cancer
and normal tissues – many potential targets that are highly expressed in solid tumors are also found at lower
levels in normal epithelial organs, leading to off-tumor toxicity. Nonetheless, we know that solid tumors comprise
a complex and sophisticated tissue with a distinct ecosystem of malignant, immune and stromal cells. From
first principles, one would predict that there should be ample discriminatory information in the tumor, if one could
design therapeutic T cells that could integrate information from across different cells in the tumor ecosystem.
We have recently developed new CAR T cell recognition circuits that can sense and respond to combinations of
antigens, even if they are present on distinct cells within the same tissue microenvironment. These circuits
utilize a synNotch receptor to detect a priming antigen, which in turn induces the expression of a CAR that kills
cells based on a killing antigen. In preliminary results, we have shown that T cells with this kind of prime-and-kill
circuit can recognize unique combinations of neighboring cells to induce killing. These types of engineered T
cells are one of the first known therapeutic agents that can integrate molecular information from across different
cells within the same tissue.
In this proposal, we hypothesize that this prime-and-kill T cell recognition circuit could be used to recognize solid
tumors based on information distributed across the tumor ecosystem. Specifically, we will target combinatorial
integration of signals that are present in cancer cells and cancer-associated stromal cells, which play a central
supportive role in a number of solid cancers. As a test case, we propose to investigate whether antigens from
cancer associated fibroblasts can be used to locally prime CAR T cells to then kill based on a cancer associated
antigen. Even if this cancer associated antigen in not perfectly specific (i.e., it is expressed in other normal
tissues), the combination of stromal and cancer cell signals should be far more specific for the tumor. Prior
efforts have unsuccessfully explored using single antigen CARs to target stromal or cancer cells individually, but
here we test whether using integrated combinatorial recognition of the cancer cell/stromal cell ecosystem can
result in significantly improved recognition specificity. If so, then this kind of integrated tumor ecosystem
recognition could be applied to a large number of solid cancers."

Ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and similar inhibitors of B-cell receptor (BCR)-
associated kinases are shifting the therapeutic landscape in B-cell neoplasia. However, the development of
resistance in patients treated with these agents is associated with rapidly progressive disease and death.
Mutations in BTK and its downstream target phospholipase Cγ2 have been implicated in resistance to ibrutinib
in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). While such mutations are found in a subset of mantle cell lymphoma
(MCL) patients, they do not account for all patterns of ibrutinib resistance. Recent studies have implicated
nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) as a potential critical component of resistance in MCL. The pathogenic contribution of
NFκB is supported by identification of a) activation of NFκB signaling pathways within the lymph node
microenvironment; b) constitutive NFκB activity resulting from recurrent mutations in TRAF2, BIRC3 and
RELA; and c) mutations in genes affecting NFκB signaling in primary ibrutinib-refractory MCL samples. Thus,
tumor-intrinsic and microenvironment-driven NFκB activation may underlie a significant fraction of ibrutinib
failures. However, the role of NFκB has not been studied prospectively in this setting. We hypothesize that
NFκB and its transcriptional targets are upregulated in patients who exhibit resistance to ibrutinib. Under Aim 1,
we will conduct a prospective study to determine functional significance of NFκB activation in ibrutinib
resistance in MCL. We will comprehensively evaluate NFκB signaling in primary MCL cells obtained from bone
marrow and/or lymph nodes prior to the start of ibrutinib, on therapy and at relapse. Given the emerging
importance of NFκB in MCL, an optimal therapeutic approach would incorporate targeting NFκB activation. In
evaluating the NFκB pathway as a therapeutic target, we discovered that it can be neutralized via blockade of
upstream regulators in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Our data indicate that NFκB activity may be
blocked by targeting NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE; a ubiquitin-like modifier) in neoplastic B-cells, resulting
in cell apoptosis. We hypothesize that therapeutic disruption of NFκB by blocking the NAE will overcome
ibrutinib resistance in MCL. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate therapeutic targeting of the E1 ligase, NAE, in ibrutinib-
resistant MCL. We will elucidate functional effects of inhibiting NAE on NFκB signaling, cell apoptosis in MCL
cell lines and primary ibrutinib-resistant cells in vitro and in a murine MCL xenograft model. Finally, Aim 3 will
assess the NAE inhibition-mediated deregulation of NFκB in neoplastic B cells and T cells obtained from
patients who receive treatment with pevonedistat and ibrutinib on a clinical trial. Our study will test novel
approaches to overcome ibrutinib resistance through NFκB inactivation, and thus significantly impact MCL
therapeutics."

The University of Utah (UU) Health Sciences Center (HSC) has a strong commitment to basic, clinical, and
translational research and a rich history of fostering medical student research. Since 1993, and with the
support of this T35 grant, the UU has developed a structured Medical Student Research Program (MSRP) that
provides a mentored, practical research experience for 15 medical students from the UU and University of
Puerto Rico (UPR) during the summer between their first and second year of medical school. The MSRP is
highly successful, as evidenced by the training records of medical student alums and corresponding faculty
mentor participants.
The UU MSRP is requesting continued support for 15 medical students to participate in the summer research
program. In brief, interested medical students from the UU and its partnering institution, the UPR, identify an
MSRP mentor and submit a proposal related to heart, lung, and/or blood research that undergoes a rigorous
evaluation by an independent review committee. Students whose meritorious projects are chosen for support
work in a laboratory under the guidance of their mentor and his/her team. Medical students enrolled in the
MSRP are trained in the ethical conduct of research and they participate in a structured summer training
program that includes classes on scientific writing, planning for careers in academic medicine, presentations
from established physician investigators in heart, lung and/or blood research, and team lab meetings. At the
end of the summer program, the students write an abstract and present their work in poster format at a fall
scientific symposium at the UU. Students are also encouraged and provided financial support to attend and
present at national meetings, continue working relationships with their mentors, publish their work, transition to
the UU MD-PhD program, and in some cases, apply for extramural grants to further pursue their research.
Importantly, analyses of the previous funding period revealed that UU medical students who participated in the
MSRP have strong publishing records and excellent career placement. It is the goal of the MSRP leaders and
faculty to continue this program so that UU and UPR medical students are exposed to heart, lung, and/or blood
research and positioned for careers as physician-scientists."

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is one of the major chronic liver diseases, encompassing symptoms from fatty liver,
alcoholic hepatitis, chronic hepatitis with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma.
Despite extensive investigations, current understanding of the pathogenesis of ALD is still limited and no effective
therapies are available for late-stage ALD besides liver transplantation. Our preliminary studies revealed a
previously unknown non-neuronal cholinergic signaling pathway between acetylcholine-producing immune cells
residing within the liver and hepatocytes expressing the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, alpha 2 subunit
(CHRNA2). This signaling pathway was activated in the livers of mice following alcohol consumption and loss of
function mouse models with genetic deletion of either Chrna2 or Chat (choline acetyltransferase, rate limiting
enzyme for acetylcholine biogenesis) suffered aggravated liver damage after chronic alcohol consumption. We
propose to thoroughly test the hypothesis that this novel hepatic acetylcholine-CHRNA2 signaling pathway plays
an adaptive/protective role against alcohol-induced liver damage. Aim 1. We will investigate how ChAT+ hepatic
non-parenchymal cells (NPCs), particularly liver-resident Kupffer cells and monocyte-derived macrophages
(MDMs), are activated after alcohol consumption. In vivo regulation will be analyzed with flow cytometry using
hepatic NPCs isolated from ChATBAC-eGFP mice and a double reporter mice (ChAT-Cre;tdTomato;ChATBAC-
eGFP). Mechanistic insights will be investigated with cultured macrophages (BMDMs) and human macrophage
cell lines. Spatial distribution of ChAT+ cells in the whole tissue will be visualized in CLARITY-prepared liver
samples and single cell RNA-seq will be carried out to characterize the transcriptomic landscape of these hepatic
cholinergic NPCs. Aim 2. We will investigate signaling mediated through CHRNA2 in hepatocytes using mouse
primary hepatocytes, HepG2 cells and human primary hepatocytes. The composition of the CHRNA2-containing
ligand-gated ion channel in hepatocytes will be investigated to enable screening for potential hepatocyte-specific
small molecule agonists to activate this signaling pathway. Aim 3. Hepatocyte-specific Chrna2 knockout mice
and immune specific ChAT knockout mice will be treated with three regimens of chronic alcohol challenge to
reveal the functional significance of this signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of ALD. A team of leading experts
in related fields have been recruited to carry out the proposed studies with interdisciplinary approaches.
Ultimately, uncovering the mechanisms that underlie this novel hepatic pathway may elucidate new routes of
therapeutic intervention for counteracting liver injury arising from excessive alcohol consumption."
10789877,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Misalignments and disruption of the circadian clock lead to metabolic and physiological dysfunctions. The clock regulates
metabolism whereas metabolic activities feedback to influence circadian rhythms, and this interplay between the clock
and metabolism coordinates physiology. However, one major knowledge gap is the limited understanding of the
mechanism by which metabolism affects clock function. The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the molecular
mechanism by which the circadian clock and lipid metabolism are interconnected through the interaction and reciprocal
regulation between lipid mediators and major clock regulators using the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. The
feasibility of the proposed research is supported by recent findings that the central glycerolipid metabolic intermediate,
phosphatidic acid (PA), directly binds to the clock transcription factor LHY (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL),
manipulations of PA-metabolizing activities alter clock outputs, and disruptions of the clock perturb lipid accumulation in
Arabidopsis. The hypothesis is that the PA-LHY interaction functions as a cellular conduit to integrate the circadian clock
with lipid metabolism and mediate lipid production and organismal responses to changing environments. To test the
hypothesis, Aim 1 will characterize PA interaction with the clock regulators by determining the lipid binding specificity
to LHY, the amino acid residues involved in PA binding, and the intracellular location of the PA-LHY interaction using
subcellular-specific PA biosensors and mass spectrometry. Aim 2 will address how altered PA metabolism entrains the
circadian clock and mediates stress responses by identifying genes/enzymes responsible for producing PA species that
alter clock function. Through quantifying the effect of cellular PA changes on the expression of genes involved in clock
regulation, these data will be used to model how cellular PA changes lead to alterations in circadian rhythms and clock
outputs. Aim 3 will determine how the circadian clock affects lipid metabolism by using clock mutants to assess how
misalignments between internal circadian rhythms and the external environment affect lipid metabolism and
accumulation. In addition, clock-targeted genes in lipid metabolism will be identified and tested for roles in the circadian
regulation of lipid accumulation. The proposed studies will reveal new regulatory mechanisms for both the circadian clock
and lipid metabolism and will advance the current understanding of the interplay between these two pathways. The results
are relevant to human health because PA is a lipid mediator involved in mammalian clock regulation and various
pathological processes, and the basic molecular mechanism of the clock is conserved between plants and humans.
Therefore, the impact of the proposed work is to advance foundational knowledge for the molecular interconnection
between lipid metabolism and the clock in eukaryotes, and the information has the potential for future strategies for
understanding and mitigating metabolic and physiological dysfunctions associated with clock disruptions."

Exposure to a broad range of environmental contaminants, including halogenated solvents, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, and heavy metals, can cause kidney injury. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is also a dose-limiting side
effect of several classes of therapeutic drugs, including many antibiotics, antiviral agents, anticancer
chemotherapeutic agents, and NSAIDs. Although some highly sensitive protein biomarkers have been
validated in recent years, they are still associated with some degree of renal damage. Markers that can
indicate exposure yet be detected prior to any or after only minimal injury are preferable. Additionally,
identification of new markers that are more closely linked to mechanism of action will enhance understanding
of mechanism and improve therapeutics. Our approach to identification of such mechanistic markers has
focused primarily on the mitochondria as common, early, and sensitive targets in proximal tubular cells for an
array of environmental contaminants and therapeutic drugs. We will use primary cultures of proximal tubular
cells from human kidneys (hPT cells) as the experimental model system. Our overall hypothesis is that
exposure of hPT cells to environmentally or therapeutically relevant concentrations of toxicants or therapeutic
agents, respectively, will modify mitochondria and other cellular components and result in release of selected
proteins and lipids and altered patterns of metabolites. Although association of mitochondrial dysfunction with
various forms of kidney injury and disease is well-established, our application of this central, underlying
concept to identify mechanistically-based biomarkers is novel. hPT cells will be treated with two environmental
contaminants (the trichloroethylene metabolite S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine [DCVC] and HgCl2) or three
therapeutic agents (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, cisplatin, and polymyxin B) that all target renal mitochondria.
Additionally, antimycin A will be used as a positive control. Preliminary studies helped refine the hypothesis
and identified three specific proteins, one mitochondrial (sulfite oxidase), one cytoskeletal (keratins), and one
cytoplasmic (HSP90), as potential biomarkers and take a targeted approach for validation. Specific Aim 1 will
take a targeted approach to determine the utility of released proteins from hPT cells as biomarkers. We will test
whether release of mitochondrial sulfite oxidase, cytoskeletal keratins, and cytoplasmic HSP90 reflect
exposure to and proximal tubular toxicity from nephrotoxicants. Release of proteins will be correlated with
parameters of renal cell function and viability and other well-established biomarkers. Specific Aim 2 will focus
on modified (adducted or oxidized) proteins in hPT cells as biomarkers. Specific Aim 3 will focus on release of
cardiolipins, other lipids, and intermediary metabolites as sensitive indicators of exposure to and proximal
tubular toxicity from nephrotoxicants. Finally, Specific Aim 4 will focus on the potential identification of proteins
in exposomes, including those identified in Aims 1 and 2, as another potential source of sensitive markers of
exposure and injury."

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common malignancy, disfiguring one million
and killing 15,000 people per year in the United States. Since the molecular drivers of cSCC are incompletely
characterized, few treatment options exist for cases which surgery does not cure. This research plan is focused
on characterizing a chromatin remodeler that is highly mutated in non-melanoma skin cancers, but is currently
understudied in human tissue. The first aim will define the wild-type regulatory mechanism using genomics
approaches in primary human keratinocytes. A mutational hotspot was also identified in epithelial tumors using
existing cancer genomics data. Genomic and proteomic approaches will determine the molecular mechanism
governing how this hotspot mutation induces gene dysregulation. Preliminary RNA-sequencing revealed that
knockdown of the catalytic subunit dysregulated DNA repair and the composition of the extracellular matrix
(ECM), pathways implicated in cancer progression. Therefore, aim two will functionally characterize how
mutation influences cancer progression. The ECM composition will be examined by western blot while the
resulting changes to epidermal adhesion will be probed by immunostaining and microscopy. The ECM informs
cellular behaviors such as proliferation and migration, which will also be investigated. These results will reveal
any pro-cancerous changes to both the epidermal niche and epidermal progenitors. Finally, an established,
inducible cSCC xenograft model will be used to determine whether the hotspot mutation accelerates cancer
progression. Altogether our results will define the regulatory mechanism of an under-characterized chromatin
remodeler in epidermal homeostasis and carcinogenesis. These results will provide functional evidence
informing whether SRCAP represents a useful cSCC biomarker or a worthwhile future therapeutic target.
The proposed research will be completed in the Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences graduate program at
Northwestern University under the supervision of the sponsor, Dr. Xiaomin Bao, and the co-sponsor, Dr.
Kathleen Green, who are experts in epidermal biology with skillsets that support the proposed experiments.
Training will take advantage of workshops, seminars, and core facilities available on both the Evanston and
Chicago campuses. This research and training plan is designed to develop the applicant's scientific technical,
analysis, communication, and mentorship skills and independence necessary to successfully transition to
postdoctoral training and ultimately a career conducting biomedical research."

Opioid overdose has been recognized as a public health emergency, as lethal drug overdoses have become
the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. The gold standard, evidence-based intervention for
opioid use disorder is pharmacotherapy, but abstinence rates following pharmacotherapy are sub-optimal.
Measurement-based care (MBC), the systematic use of client self-report data to inform and enhance
treatment, is an evidence-based intervention that could be uniquely well suited to complement
pharmacotherapy for OUD. Unfortunately, very few community opioid treatment programs (OTPs) offer
psychosocial interventions to complement pharmacotherapy due to the high volume of patients served and a
reliance on group therapy models to accommodate this large census. There is a pressing need for flexible
psychosocial intervention structures for use in OTPs that are not associated with typical barriers found in full
package, manualized interventions. The training and research activities in this proposal seek to enhance the
provision of MBC in community OTPs through two research phases bolstered by four training aims. In Phase 1
of the research plan, the candidate, supported by the experienced mentorship team, will work with 8 OTPs to
develop community-engaged research partnerships, complete site visits, and engage treatment providers,
leaders, staff, and patients in qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys. Phase 1 outcomes will be used to
inform site selection for MBC implementation and to facilitate adaptation of an MBC assessment protocol for
use in OTPs. Phase 2 will involve a pilot type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation study with four OTPs. The
candidate will work with the OTPs to integrate MBC into electronic medical record documentation procedures.
Treatment providers will also receive MBC training and ongoing support, and preliminary MBC effectiveness
and implementation data will be collected. To conduct this research, the candidate requires training in four key
areas: 1) development and management of community-engaged partnerships to support effectiveness and
implementation trials in addiction treatment; 2) training in evidence-based assessment and intervention
methods for OUD; 3) training in mixed methods data collection using rapid ethnography; and 4) training in
measure design and adaptation. These training aims will be supported by the Brown University Center for
Alcohol and Addiction Studies as well as by the candidate’s mentorship team. The mentorship team will be led
by Primary Mentor Dr. Sara Becker, an expert in implementation science and community partnership
development in substance use treatment settings. The proposal will also be supported by Dr. Francesca
Beaudoin, Dr. Lawrence Palinkas, and Dr. Melissa Clark, experts in OUD intervention, rapid mixed methods
data collection, and measure design, respectively. Taken together, this research and career development plan
will advance a significant public health issue by enhancing the quality of OUD care while launching the
independent career of the candidate in the implementation of MBC in OTPs."

Poor sleep is common in people with Crohn’s disease (CD) and predicts greater likelihood of symptom flares,
surgery, hospitalization, and reduced quality of life. Insomnia disorder – chronic difficulty with initiating or
maintaining sleep – is the most common sleep disorder in this population. It is also associated with increases
in both chronic pain and inflammation. While insomnia in this population may initially develop due to CD flares,
our preliminary data indicate that people with CD and insomnia report insomnia-related behaviors and are
interested in treatment for their sleep problems.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended first-line treatment for insomnia
disorder. It is highly effective not only for treating insomnia, but also for improving pain and inflammation.
However, while effectiveness of CBT-I has been demonstrated in other populations, nighttime bowel
movements and the hypervigilance that results from fear of fecal incontinence are unique to Crohn’s,
highlighting the importance of investigation in this population.
In this K23 project, the applicant will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of CBT-I adapted for CD vs
control in 60 adults with CD and insomnia. Using a mixed-methods approach, she will investigate: 1) the
feasibility and acceptability of CBT-I in CD; 2) the impact of CBT-I on insomnia, sleep patterns, CD symptoms,
and inflammation; and 3) treatment response subgroups and barriers and facilitators to intervention
engagement. This research is expected to advance our understanding of the sleep/CD relationship and
possible treatment options for a significant problem affecting this population.
To support the applicant’s career development, training goals, and proposed research project, she has
assembled an exceptional mentorship team that brings expertise in CD pathophysiology, assessment, and
management (Dr. Corey Siegel), objective sleep assessment and CBT-I (Dr. Michael Smith), mixed-methods
research (Dr. Kelly Aschbrenner), behavioral clinical trials in IBD (Dr. Laurie Keefer), and longitudinal methods
and data analysis (Dr. Tor Tosteson). The applicant’s training will involve a combination of didactic and
practical experiences, conferences, and use of the excellent research infrastructure supported by Dartmouth-
Hitchcock Health and the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. This comprehensive program of training
and research will prepare her to compete for NIH R01 funding to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT-I compared
to control in a larger, fully powered randomized controlled trial."
10756950,"Project Summary/Abstract
Misuse of opioids represents a substantial public and economic burden in the US and worldwide. The existing
pharmacological approaches to treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) are most efficacious when coupled with
behavioral therapies that target individual triggers to reduce or eliminate excessive drug consumption. While
individual variability in opioid use have been acknowledged repeatedly in animal behavioral models, the
genomic markers linked to neurobiological adaptations underlying such variability are not well understood. We
argue that understanding the molecular background of individual differences in behavioral vulnerability to
opioid use is critical for development of personalized pharmacogenomic approaches for OUD that may
replicate clinical success of personalized cancer treatments. In line with this argument, we hypothesize that
individual behavioral variability in escalation of fentanyl use is linked to systems level variability of
genomic and functional networks within in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. Escalation of
drug intake is a central component of OUD diagnosis that can be modeled in animals trained to self-administer
opioids under extended access conditions. Based on the published literature and preliminary data, we propose
three complementary Aims to monitor development of escalated intake at behavioral, functional
cellular/network, and genomic levels of analysis. Our Aim 1 hypothesizes that escalation of fentanyl intake
emerges on the background of individual differences in sensitivity to non-drug (sucrose) reward. Finding
evidence to support this aim has the potential to identify vulnerable individuals prior to initiation of opioid use.
Aim 2 examines neuronal outcomes associated with escalated fentanyl intake. Specifically, we will evaluate
whether individual profiles of escalated intake reflect altered regulation of cell excitability by four potassium
channel families and the impact on neuronal output at single cell and network levels. The data collected as part
of this aim will establish functional, neuronal drivers of vulnerability to escalated intake. Finally, Aim 3
compares the genomic landscape underlying variable fentanyl escalation in laboratory animals (rats) to human
opioid use databases. In this aim, we take advantage of cell-type specific RNA sequencing to evaluate both
neuronal and non-neuronal mechanisms of escalated intake in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex.
This aim is expected to identify novel molecular pathways linked to fentanyl escalation and test the
translational relevance of our preclinical findings to a human sample. To characterize interactions at the
behavioral, functional, and genomic levels of analysis, a unifying statistical framework is developed based on
linear mixed models to examine the strength of bi-directional relationships between behavioral escalation of
intake and molecular outcomes."

Protein synthesis is subject to elaborate transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in growing
bacterial cells. Such mechanisms ensure that protein synthesis is efficiently coupled to the needs of a
rapidly dividing cell when nutrients are not limiting. However, most microbial life exists in a non-
proliferating state of quiescence that enables survival during nutrient limitation and in stressful
environments. Thus, the needs of quiescent cells are rather different from growing cells as they must
minimize energy consumption so as to maximize available resources over a potentially extended
period. Protein synthesis is the most energy intensive metabolic process in a cell, accounting for as
much as ~70% of total energy consumption in bacteria. Consistently, many bacteria such as Bacillus
subtilis are known to substantially reduce protein synthesis when they exit exponential growth.
However, quiescent cells need to effectively exploit the emergence of favorable conditions and
undergo resuscitation, so this attenuation needs to be rapidly reversible. In addition, as the ribosome
is itself the most energetically costly macromolecular machine to synthesize, it must be protected from
any degradative processes. And, as with translational attenuation, this protection must be compatible
with efficient re-initiation of protein synthesis when conditions improve. Thus, both the inhibitory and
protective mechanisms need to be quickly reversible. How the cell balances these two goals is the
subject of this research proposal. First, we examine how ribosomes are protected from degradation
under metabolic conditions where de novo ribosome biosynthesis is limited. Second, we investigate a
reversible mechanism of translation inactivation with particular focus on the role of the nucleotide
(p)ppGpp."
10767846,"The characterization of CRISPR/Cas as a method to edit genes that contribute to human diseases
provides new opportunities for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches. Seven years ago, this
bacterial immune system was adapted to cleave specific regions in the human genome. Currently, there are
over a dozen clinical trials planned or in process for cancer, genetic disorders and infectious diseases that
utilize CRISPR editing. Moreover, gene editing can be used to cleave and potentially excise viral genomes
within infected cells, which offers hope for curative strategies for HIV-1 and hepatitis B infections, as well as
others. The majority of pre-clinical and clinical studies use the Cas9 enzyme derived from common human
pathogens, and evidence for the existence of humoral and cellular immunity to Cas9 could stymie the utility of
this editor in a subset of patients, especially if delivered in vivo using viral vectors, or if therapy requires
repeated infusions (1, 2).
 These and other limitations of the family of Cas9 endonucleases argue for the development of a more
diverse toolbox of gene editing enzymes. Recently, several novel Cas enzymes termed CasX (Cas12e) and
CasY (Cas12d) were identified in metagenomic sequencing data from environmental isolates (3), and we are
actively developing these enzymes for gene editing. The advantages of these enzymes include their derivation
from non-pathogenic bacterial species, their relatively compact size compared to Cas9, and their distinct
protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) requirements. The cut generated by the guide RNA/CasX ribonucleoprotein
complex is asymmetrical and generates single stranded DNA overhangs. This unique cleavage cut could then
be leveraged to excise a target region by employing two different guide RNAs that flank the area of interest. By
careful selection of guide RNAs, we expect that we can generate DNA overhangs on opposite DNA strands
that are complementary to each other so they anneal during DNA repair, essentially excising the intervening
region. In addition, we expect that these asymmetrical overhangs can also be used to anneal to an
exogenously supplied donor DNA fragment, so that the excised region is replaced by new DNA sequence.
 Our proposed studies will develop CRISPR/CasX to replace the wild-type CCR5 gene with the CCR5-
delta 32 allele in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) as a next generation approach to the development of a
therapeutic application for HIV-1. It is well established that cells from individuals who are homozygous for the
CCR5-delta 32 allele are resistant to R5-tropic HIV infection, and generating autologous HSCs carrying two
copies of this mutation could potentially allow the permanent cessation of anti-retroviral therapy. To
accomplish this goal, we will develop combinations of guide RNAs to excise the CCR5 gene, and replace it
with donor DNA carrying the mutant allele. Next generation sequencing approaches (CIRCLE-seq, MTA-seq)
will be used to assess the relative efficiency and specificity of CasX both in vitro and in cells. An RNA beacon
will be used to select for cells in which both CCR5 alleles are replaced. Finally, various proportions of wild-type
and CCR5-delta 32-modified HSCs will be used to humanize immunodeficient mice. Mathematical modeling
will define the minimum number of edited HSCs necessary to produce normal numbers of immune cells
following HIV-1 challenge. Ultimately, our approach will lead to the development of novel Cas editors to replace
cellular genes required for HIV-1 infection with those that impart HIV resistance."
10767794,"This VA Merit research project aims to define host factors associated with mucosal infection by an emerging multi-drug
resistant human fungal pathogen, Candida auris. Most human fungal infections are caused by Candida spp, the most
common being C. albicans which colonizes approximately half of healthy adults. Pathological overgrowth can occur with
perturbations to the commensal microbiota or host immunity and is normally limited to mucosal surfaces. However,
bloodstream infections due to Candida spp. are common in healthcare settings and are associated with a high rate of
mortality. Recently, the highly virulent strain Candida auris has emerged as an important healthcare-associated
pathogen that has rapidly disseminated to multiple countries. This yeast is particularly concerning because it is often
resistant to commonly used antifungal agents, with some strains exhibiting resistance to all currently available classes of
antifungals (i.e., azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins). As of June, 2019, a rising number of clinical cases of C. auris
have been reported in the United States, now over 700. Alarmingly, screening of close contacts in health care facilities
shows that additional patients and care givers can be colonized with C. auris, showing the potential for widespread
dissemination in healthcare settings. At this time, C auris outbreaks have just started to be detected in VA facilities.
Based on the demographics of at risk patients (elderly, immunosuppressed, ICU or nursing home residents) and the
rapid emergence of this pathogen in the US, it is likely just a matter of time before this emerging strain of Candida is
more widely detected in veteran patient populations. To develop effective approaches to prevent transmission, there is
an urgent need for studies that clarify the propensity for C. auris to colonize mucosal surfaces including the oral and
intestinal tracts and to identify host factors that promote infection and overgrowth of this emerging pathogen. To date,
few animal models of C. auris have been developed and currently there are no mucosal animal models of C auris
infection or colonization. We have developed a novel mucosal model in which C. auris oral and gastrointestinal mucosal
infection is observed as well as persistent shedding of the pathogen in stool. Our overall research goal is to define host
factors including immune and microbiome profiles that alter susceptibility to Candida auris. In this project we plan to
utilize our models of oral and GI infection to investigate the impact of factors such as antibiotic pre-exposure, alterations
of the microbiome, and innate immune activation on infection with C. auris. We will utilize both in vitro and in vivo
models to define critical innate immune receptors and pathways that impact mucosal infection with Candida auris. As
many patients who are infected with C auris have previously received antibiotics to treat other infections, we will next
determine the impact of antibiotic-induced alterations of the gut and oral microbiome on Candida auris infection. This
project is highly significant given the rapid emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of Candida auris which poses a
world-wide public health threat that also will likely impact Veteran’s health. Our project will advance our understanding
of immune and systemic risk factors for infection with this pathogen, develop novel mucosal models of infection and
study the impact of the microbiome on susceptibility to infection. Ultimately our goal is to help identify Veteran and
other patient populations at highest risk for infection."
10763016,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of this project is to harness the untapped reactivity of abundant feedstock materials and
renewable natural products to enable the production of useful synthetic intermediates and the late-stage
functionalization of biomedically relevant molecules. In particular, we have recently formulated new approaches
for selective C(sp3)–C(sp2) bond functionalization of alkenes, using a combination of O3-mediated oxidation and
Fe(II)-mediated reductive fragmentation–radical capture. The net result has been replacement of the alkene
C(sp3)–C(sp2) bond with C(sp3)–H, C(sp3)–S, C(sp3)–O, C=O, and C(sp3)–C(sp2) bonds. This redox-based
dealkenylative radical chemistry has allowed us to employ readily available natural products (e.g., terpenoids)
as starting materials to streamline the chemical synthesis of biologically active natural product targets and active
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). While many synthetic methods rely on the functionalization of C(sp2)–C(sp2)
double bonds, generalized methods for functionalizing alkene C(sp3)–C(sp2) linkages remain elusive. Our
reaction is the first generalized functionalization of the C(sp3)–C(sp2) single bond; therefore, we envisioned that
it would have broad impact on total synthesis, the late-stage diversification of pharmaceuticals, and the
preparation of value-added compounds from abundant starting materials. Going forward, we propose to develop
Fe(II)- or Cu(I)-catalyzed functionalization of alkene C(sp3)–C(sp2) bonds for the construction of C(sp3)–C and
C(sp3)–heteroatom bonds. Our inspiration for these transition metal–catalyzed dealkenylative cross-coupling
strategies originated from the bio-pathway for H2O2 decomposition catalyzed by Cu- and Fe-containing
peroxygenases. Furthermore, Cu possesses exceptional capacity for both the radical capture and reductive
elimination steps necessary for radical cross-couplings. We have used these catalytic strategies for modular
construction of C(sp3)–N bonds within terpenes and terpenoids, affording artificial terpenoid alkaloids, and to
provide a new vision for the editing of all-carbon frameworks. We will expand this strategy to C(sp3)–C bond-
forming processes related to, for example, Suzuki–Miyaura coupling, the Sonogashira reaction,
trifluoromethylation, and cyanation. We will expand the source of alkyl radicals to include carbonyls and phenols,
both of which can be converted into α-alkoxy hydroperoxides—the pivotal reaction intermediates. Finally,
leveraging the power of well-established enantioselective allylation, we will seek to establish a divergent route
to access a wide variety of enantiopure molecules featuring chiral quaternary centers. Realization of these
proposed aims would substantially impact the sustainable synthesis of fine chemicals. These studies will also
provide new visions and strategies for the editing of alkenes and other natural products. While our program does
not target a specific disease, collectively it could impact a variety of therapeutic areas by producing valuable
synthetic intermediates for and facilitating divergent modification of biomedically relevant molecules."

Pericytes have been implicated in lung injury and repair in a number of organs. Our research focuses on the
role of lung stromal subpopulations in tissue injury and repair, and our recent work revealed lung pericytes
may have multiple functional roles during injury. Data from transcriptomic analyses of activated lung
pericytes reveal upregulation of multiple genes involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, and matrix
remodeling. The goal of this project is to characterize the functional diversity of pericytes in their response
to a clinically relevant model of lung injury – influenza infection. To achieve this goal, we will test
hypotheses on the roles of pericytes in endothelial and immune regulation. In Aim 1, we will investigate the
mechanisms of pericyte-endothelial cell crosstalk that lead to activation of endothelial cells and increased
lung permeability. Angiopoietin-L4 (ANGPTL4) has been implicated as a hyperpermeability factor that is
also highly upregulated in activated lung pericytes in our preliminary studies. We will examine how pericyte-
derived ANGPTL4 affects lung endothelial function in this aim. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of lung
pericytes in trafficking inflammatory monocytes. In murine models of influenza infection, inflammatory
monocytes have been implicated in the development of lung injury. Recruitment of inflammatory monocytes
in influenza occurs through a CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) dependent mechanism. Our work shows
that activated pericytes highly upregulate CCL2, a major ligand for CCR2. We will evaluate the functional
role of pericyte-derived CCL2, and other CCR2 ligands, in inflammatory monocyte recruitment. Finally, in
Aim 3, we will characterize functional subsets in the pericyte population using single nucleus transcriptomic
approaches. This proposed aim will provide insight into the diverse functional states of lung pericytes
throughout the course of influenza infection and functional subtypes that mediate lung injury."

A healthful diet during early childhood is important for healthy growth and development and contributes to the
prevention of chronic diseases. Parents influence children’s dietary intake through their use of food parenting
practices.
Research to date shows positive associations of structure- and autonomy support- food parenting
practices with healthful dietary intake and eating behaviors in children, whereas coercive controlling and
indulgent practices have been associated with unhealthful dietary intake and the development of maladaptive
eating behaviors over time. While research has historically evaluated parents’ “usual” approach to feeding
children via questionnaires, recent evidence reveals important within- and between-day variation in use of food
parenting practices across time and contexts. Parents have identified a range of momentary factors (e.g.,
activities, limited time, stress) in everyday family life that alter their usual approach. Parents described shifts
from the use of structure- and autonomy support- feeding practices to more indulgent and controlling practices
in the face of external challenges. We have recently obtained quantitative evidence of these within- and
between-day shifts in food parenting practices through the use of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA);
EMA uses short surveys delivered to hand-held devices in real time throughout the day to capture dynamic
changes in behaviors across time and context. For instance, we have observed that parental stress early in the
day is associated with greater use of controlling feeding practices later in the day. Our goal is to build on and
extend the evidence-base of food parenting approaches for preventing poor dietary intake among children. We
argue that parents’ approach to feeding varies across time and context and that a deepened understanding of
the variability in food parenting practices and associated outcomes is necessary to design interventions to help
parents maintain consistent use of supportive practices despite challenging circumstances. We propose to
comprehensively investigate the impact of within- and between-day fluctuations in food parenting practices on
children’s dietary intake overtime using a longitudinal study conducted with a sample (n=240) of racially/
ethnically- and socioeconomically- diverse parent-preschooler dyads. Data will be collected via state-of-the-art
measures, including EMA and interview-led 24-hour diet recalls every 6 months for two years. The proposed
study represents a significant and necessary next step to inform the development of clinic-based
recommendations and public health interventions that account for- and are responsive to- momentary factors
found to influence parent’s use of specific food parenting practices."

 The voltage-gated Hv1 proton channel is a member of voltage-gated ion channel family, it
plays a key role in the acid extrusion from excitable and non-excitable cells and regulate pH
homeostasis in a variety of cell types. The Hv1 proton channel provides charge and pH
compensation during the respiratory burst of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase and controls
production of reactive oxygen species in phagocytes, it mediates proton efflux at the pulmonary
alveolar cell membrane and acidifies excessively alkaline airway surface liquid in the airway cells.
Hv1 is found to be a sperm flagellar regulator of intracellular pH, and play a crucial role in sperm
capacitation. In addition, Hv1 activity is required for acid extrusion to shape action potentials in
snail neurons. Studies have shown that biophysical properties and functions of the Hv1 channel
are not identical in a variety of tissues, the distinct manifestations of native voltage-gated proton
channels in different cell types indicate the existence of modulatory partners modulating the Hv1
proton channel's function. We recently identified a family of transmembrane protein as the Hv1
channel interactor. We discovered that the presence of the transmembrane protein alters the Hv1
channel's activity and modulates the channel's voltage-dependent gating. The goal of this
proposal is designed to determine the effects of the transmembrane protein on the Hv1 channel
physiology, biophysics, and pharmacology. The proposed research will establish the physiological
relevance of Hv1 channel regulation by transmembrane modulators and shed light on novel
voltage-gated ion channel regulatory mechanisms."
10770376,"Emergency care often determines the patient outcome as it is critical to make accurate, timely diagnoses and interventions during the early stages of the injury or disease. The Strategies to Innovate Emergency Care Clinical Trials Network (SIREN) was created by the NIH to enable the investigation of different emergency care treatments spanning across organ systems and diseases without duplication of effort, thereby minimizing start- up costs and promoting economies of scale. The purpose of the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for SIREN is to provide a comprehensive data management and statistical infrastructure to support the network’s goal of conducting high quality clinical trials that will improve outcomes for patients with neurologic, cardiac, respiratory, hematologic and trauma emergency events. This renewal application, in response to RFA-NS-22-013, describes the features, functions and coordination we will continue to provide as the DCC for the SIREN Network.  The DCC’s role is to establish a collaborative relationship with all parties involved in the Network and provide efficient and standardized central data management that yields high quality data, provide statistical support in the planning and execution of the clinical trials, prepare and disseminate trial reports for the various stakeholders and facilitate data sharing. To this end, the Data Coordination Unit (DCU) at the Medical University of South Carolina has developed a web-based comprehensive integrated data and project management system, WebDCU™, that enables distributed data entry from the participating clinical sites with extensive data quality control. The DCU also provides the necessary tools to efficiently manage operational activities across multiple trials, while ensuring compliance with FDA regulations and guidelines. Using the WebDCU system, we have developed, implemented and maintained a central database that streamlines and maximizes efficiency in the management of data collection, processing, and monitoring of clinical data. In addition, the WebDCU™ incorporates trial management information that provides full support for all study operational activities in SIREN. In collaboration with the individual study Principal Investigator and our partners of SIREN (CCC, Hubs, Governance Committees), the DCU will continue to: contribute to the innovative and efficient protocol development (including study design and case report form development); oversee data quality; generate reports for the DSMB, regulatory parties and the study teams; conduct interim and final analysis and dissemination of study results via presentations and publications; and create public use datasets for data sharing. SIREN initiated 5 large, simple multicenter trials over the previous 5 year grant period and will initiate at least 4 more in the next grant period. The network aims to transform the emergency research enterprise, by exploring innovations in clinical trial designs, by better and earlier engagement of patient stakeholders in trial planning, and by creative improvements in implementing and performing trials."
10757637,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There are nearly three million mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) in the U.S. each year, and most occur in
patients less than 21 years of age. Clinical assessment of mTBI relies on symptom surveys that cannot
accurately predict the duration of symptoms or objectively identify brain recovery. A biologic test would allow
physicians to provide individualized recommendations for school and athletics participation, prescribe timely
pharmacologic treatments, or initiate early psychosocial services in patients at risk for persistent post-
concussion symptoms (PPCS). Non-coding ribonucleic acids (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs, are epi-
transcriptional molecules that are altered in patients with mTBI. They can be measured in peripheral biofluids
such as serum, or even saliva. Our previous research demonstrates that ncRNA changes in cerebrospinal fluid
are reflected in saliva, and that saliva ncRNA levels can predict PPCS. Validation of these findings in a large,
independent cohort could yield a biologic measure of PPCS risk (Aim 1), and guide individualized clinical
management decisions (Aim 2). This scientific premise forms the basis for our proposed multi-center study. We
will enroll 750 adolescents (ages 13-18 years) with mTBI, defined by the World Health Organization and Berlin
Consensus Criteria. We will measure levels of saliva ncRNAs enriched in neuronal and glial exosomes at
acute (<48 hours), sub-acute (7 days), and chronic (30 days) post-injury time points. PPCS will be defined by
persistence of ≥ 3 symptoms on day 30 (compared with pre-injury state, determined by the Post-Concussion
Symptom Inventory; PCSI). In 250 participants (training set), we will use a LASSO technique to refine a
multivariate model, that employs acute and sub-acute ncRNA levels, along with clinical, social, and
psychologic factors, to predict PPCS (while controlling for biologic covariates). Accuracy of the model will be
externally validated in the remaining 500 participants (test set). Sensitivity and specificity will be compared to
the validated “5P” clinical prediction tool. We will also examine the relationships between concussive symptom
phenotypes and ncRNA levels with a factor analysis and hierarchical clustering. In Aim 2, we will use LASSO
in a training set (n=250) to refine a second multivariate model, that uses acute and chronic ncRNA levels,
along with clinical, social, and psychologic factors to identify concussion recovery. Recovery will be defined by
self-report of “no difference from pre-injury” on the PCSI. Accuracy of the model will be externally validated in
the test set, and compared to the accuracy of reaction time performance across acute and chronic time points.
Our multi-disciplinary team includes experts in pediatrics, neurology, molecular biology, psychology, and
emergency medicine with a published track record of collaboration and the expertise necessary for this
proposal’s success. The study will yield an objective measure of PPCS risk, concussion phenotype, and
clinical recovery. When paired with medical, social, and psychologic assessments, this technology will allow
researchers to study mTBI therapies in biologically-defined patient subsets and personalize concussion care."
10758199,"CANCER CENTER ADMINISTRATION - ABSTRACT
Administration at the Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) provides support to the Cancer Center leadership,
Research Program and Shared Resource infrastructure, KCI membership, and staff by providing services aimed
at relieving the administrative burden associated with research. Administration contributes to the mission of the
Cancer Center by providing efficient management of resources, facilitating key internal and external scientific
meetings, strategic planning, and developing useful metrics to aid in the decision making of KCI senior
leadership. Mr. Evano Piasentin, Associate Center Director for Research Administration, leads an experienced
administrative team. Administration supports 135 scientific members across four research Programs and nine
Shared Resources (including one under development). Additionally, Administration manages extramural funding
of $63 million (annual direct costs), KCI’s annual research budget of $21 million, and coordinated internal pilot
funding of more than $2 million since the last renewal.
Notable achievements during the past funding period include a restructuring of the administrative office to
capitalize on the unique skills of staff and provide a more efficient and dynamic environment to meet the needs
of the Cancer Center. Additionally, Administration supported the planning, process, and development of a new
strategic plan through organization of strategic planning retreats convening stakeholders from various disciplines
across KCI. The strategic plan is centered on five priority areas: immunology and immunotherapy, cancer
metabolism and metabolomics, biology of cancer health disparities, addressing multilevel determinants of risk
and survivorship, and increasing interventional research to reduce disparities. Administration continues to
implement significant upgrades to the Research Administration Application (RAA©), a homegrown repository of
CCSG data for KCI. With respect to space management, Administration managed a relocation of basic science
laboratories from the outdated Prentis Cancer Research Building to the renovated Elliman Research Building.
Finally, Administration played a central role in the development of several large, multi-PI project grants leading
to the first-ever funded SPORE grant at KCI; The Michigan Prostate SPORE (P50CA186786)."
10758206,"CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING AND EDUCATION COORDINATION (CRTEC) – ABSTRACT
Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) provides extensive cancer research training and educational programs that
span all career stages. Dr. Michele Cote (PSDR), Associate Center Director for Education, leads KCI’s CRTEC
efforts. In addition to identification, promotion, and support of University-sponsored training activities, Dr. Cote
(PSDR) coordinates the cancer-specific programs at KCI. With the support of CRTEC Education Advisory
Council members, each with expertise in a particular field or window of training, Dr. Cote (PSDR) serves as the
main point of contact for trainees across the career trajectory. A key component of the CRTEC is to evaluate
the effectiveness of the supported training activities, and identifying gaps and opportunities to enhance KCI
training efforts across the spectrum.
KCI’s education efforts span the education and training continuum including efforts focused on high school
students, undergraduate students, graduate and medical students, post-doctoral trainees, residents and fellows,
junior faculty, tenured faculty and community healthcare providers. CRTEC efforts are supported by ten active
training projects totaling $895,210 direct costs. Several have grown out of a T32 led by Dr. Matherly (MT)
(T32CA009531). This training program in the biology of cancer that has been continuously funded for over three
decades. Since 2015, 24 students have been supported via the T32, five of whom were also awarded
subsequent F30 or F31 support. Novel efforts at KCI include the launch of focuSStem in 2019, a program
developed by a high school student, for high school students, with support from KCI leadership. In its inaugural
year, five schools and 149 students have participated in the day-long program (37% African American, 30% non-
Hispanic white, 27% Arab American, 4% Hispanic and 2% other races; over 50% females). A recent addition to
our efforts in reaching high school students is the Discovery to Cure High School Internship Program (DTCHIP)

10758212,"TUMOR BIOLOGY AND MICROENVIRONMENT (TBM) – ABSTRACT
The Tumor Biology and Microenvironment (TBM) Program is a translational science program that aims to
discover the cellular and molecular determinants that drive the initiation and progression of cancers through
interactions with their microenvironments and develop and test innovative diagnostic and treatment strategies.
This highly integrated Program includes 37 members from 13 departments and 4 schools at Wayne State
University. TBM Program members, who conduct basic, preclinical, and clinical research, receive $4,468,183
in peer reviewed, cancer-related grant support, of which $1,943,419 is from the NCI. The TBM Program is
organized along three major themes. The goal of the first theme is to explore biological processes that mediate
the phenotypical plasticity, proliferation, and survival of tumor cells. Translational research is conducted to
evaluate the potential clinical application of these molecular determinants as tumor markers and/or therapeutic
targets. The second theme investigates mechanisms that enable tumor cells to overcome external barriers during
invasion and metastasis. Our investigators assess the importance of factors that control extracellular proteolysis
and signaling mechanisms that are being used by tumor cells to adapt to and subvert the microenvironment at
primary and metastatic sites. The objective of the third theme is to develop new strategies to engage the immune
system as powerful defenses against cancer. Research activities include the development of immune modulators
and novel vehicles to optimally deliver immunotherapeutics, as well as the use of state-of-the art imaging
modalities for monitoring the success to tumor immunotherapy. The TBM Program is led by Dr. Kay-Uwe
Wagner as Program Leader and Dr. Asfar Azmi as Program Co-Leader. The Leader and Co-Leader are new
since the last competitive renewal. All members of the TBM Program actively collaborate with members of the
MI, MT, and PSDR Programs at KCI. Of the 484 manuscripts published between December 2015 and November
2019, 41% and 44% were intra- and inter-programmatic, respectively, and 61% were multi-institutional
collaborations."
10758218,"MOLECULAR IMAGING (MI) – ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the Molecular Imaging (MI) Program at KCI is to develop new imaging technologies through
pre-clinical, early clinical and national studies to better understand tumor physiology, aid in the assessment of
novel therapeutic approaches and make new imaging methods available to improve routine clinical care. This
highly integrated Program includes 24 members from 7 departments and 4 schools at Wayne State University
and $3,541,404 in peer reviewed cancer-related funding, of which $772,287 is from the NCI. The MI Program
is led by Dr. Juri Gelovani as Program Leader and Dr. Nerissa Viola as a Program Co-Leader. The MI Program
is built on close collaborations among the imaging scientists, biomedical engineers, chemists, biologists, clinical
oncologists, radiologists, and nuclear medicine physicians. Members with complementary expertise work with
colleagues from other KCI Programs to apply their expertise in molecular imaging to answer important biological
and clinical questions. Together investigators conduct research using our integrated small animal imaging core
facility with optical, 7T MR, microPET/CT, microSPECT/CT, and a recently-installed large animal (clinical)
PET/CT scanner, the developing Cyclotron-Radiochemistry Core and other Shared Resources at KCI. Molecular
imaging is also being used to complement genetic and epigenetic analyses of tumor specimens. While genetic
and epigenetic analyses can investigate thousands of genes simultaneously, imaging allows investigators to
study the magnitude and heterogeneity of the gene product expression-activity non-invasively and to obtain such
repeated measurements over the course of tumor progression and response to treatment. Furthermore,
functional measurements obtained with molecular imaging can assist in determining if a particular pathway is
active and if it is important in tumor physiology, something that simple measurements of gene expression or
protein level in vitro or in situ may not be able to demonstrate. Bioengineering experts in the MI Program are
developing novel instruments and methods for structural, functional, and molecular imaging of cancer, including
novel MRI sequences, instruments for hyperpolarization of agents and hpMR spectroscopic imaging, ultrasound
tomography and photoacoustic imaging. The ultimate goal of the MI Program is to translate the results of pre-
clinical research into the clinic. Several imaging agents, methods, and instruments developed ""in house” are now
progressing to early phase clinical trials. All members of the MI Program actively collaborate with members of
the TBM, MT, and PSDR Programs at KCI. Of the 333 manuscripts published between December 2015 and
November 2019, 39% and 30% were intra- and inter-programmatic, respectively, and 66% were multi-
institutional collaborations."
10758226,"MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS – ABSTRACT
The mission of the Molecular Therapeutics (MT) Program is to translate laboratory findings to the clinic and to
facilitate collaborations between basic and clinical scientists, to improve the lives of patients with cancer by
identifying new molecules, targets, and strategies for treating cancer. This highly interactive Program includes
50 members from 11 departments and 4 schools at Wayne State University and the Karmanos Cancer Institute
(KCI) Network and $3,031,514 in peer reviewed, cancer-related funding, of which $971,206 is from the NCI.
Additionally, industry-sponsored clinical trial funding is $29,599,781. Program membership includes a cross
section of laboratory-based and clinical investigators in the KCI who interact through programmatic activities and
collaborate on research grants and investigator-initiated clinical trials. The scientific themes of the MT Program
are to: 1) identify and validate novel therapeutics, targets and pathways for selective tumor targeting; 2) identify
cellular/molecular determinants and biomarkers of tumor response; and 3) validate effectiveness of new agents
in interventional treatment trials. The MT Program focuses on new approaches for treating cancer, ranging from
drug discovery to mechanism-based efforts emphasizing mechanisms-of-action of novel tumor-targeted and
standard agents and critical signaling pathways, all with the goal of clinical translation. The interests of MT
members include tumor metabolism, nuclear transporters, transcriptional targets, and signaling pathways, and
extend to the impact of therapy on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Biomarker research includes pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics, cellular and molecular biomarkers and molecular/genetic profiles predictive of
responses to therapy and/or that lead to actionable therapies. A particular emphasis is on biomarkers relevant
to cancer disparities between African American and white patients as treatment targets and for personalized
treatment trials. Research in the MT Program draws from our nationally/internationally recognized clinical trials
program at KCI, which employs tumor profiling (including genomic profiling) to facilitate enrollment on phase I
and early phase II trials and to identify patients most likely to respond to particular treatments. Phase II clinical
trials draw from basic laboratory findings, culminating in investigator-initiated clinical trials. MT members lead
phase III trials, often working with multi-center teams and cooperative groups. MT Program members study all
major cancer types including those that occur at high incidence in the KCI catchment area. These initiatives have
helped define cancer health disparities in our catchment area, identify racial differences in tumor biology, and
led to enrollment of large numbers of African Americans in clinical trials. The overriding goal of the MT Program
is to conduct and deliver patient-centered cancer research and treatment to benefit patients in the catchment
area. MT Program members extensively collaborate with members of the MI, TBM, and PSDR Programs at
KCI. Of the 935 manuscripts published between December 2015 and November 2019, 34% and 32% were intra-

The Population Studies and Disparities Research (PSDR) Program is committed to identifying key genetic
and behavioral risk factors underlying disease onset and progression and developing and testing novel
intervention strategies to reduce risk and improve diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes with an emphasis on
reducing and/or eliminating cancer health disparities among populations contained within our catchment area.
This interactive Program includes 28 members from 11 departments and 3 schools at Wayne State University
and $6,936,093 in peer reviewed, cancer-related funding, of which $5,793,590 is from the NCI. The PSDR
Program has two overarching scientific themes. The first theme is to investigate the distribution and
determinants of cancer risk, survivorship, and outcomes in a racially and ethnically diverse population. Major
scientific investigations under this theme use emerging advances in genetics to address our highly-diverse
catchment area population that is approximately 25% African American, includes the largest Arab-American
community in the US; developing projects target both sexual and gender minority cancer survivors and rural
populations within our expanded catchment area. The work is supported by the Detroit area population-based
cancer registry, a founding participant in the SEER Program, a resource that is well-leveraged for extensive
population-based studies of the epidemiology of lung, breast, prostate, colon, ovarian, and endometrial cancers
in diverse populations. The second theme is to develop and test evidence-based interventions focused on
patient, family member, and physician behaviors to reduce disparities in cancer prevention, treatment,
survivorship, and end-of-life outcomes. The main focus of this theme is modifying social and behavioral factors
driving risk behaviors, screening and treatment choices, the quality of physician-patient-family member
communication, symptom management, and survivorship in racially and ethnically diverse adult and pediatric
populations. The work is supported by a unique, custom-designed video data capture system installed in multiple
clinic sites to study the ways racial bias and poor communication give rise to unequal treatment decisions and
health outcomes. Future directions include the development of multi-PI grants focused on African American
cancer survivors, leveraging the Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (Detroit ROCS) cohort study. The Detroit
ROCS study is the largest single cohort conducted exclusively among African American cancer survivors with a
goal of understanding the determinants of poorer outcomes in this population. eHealth technologies to enhance
patient-provider communication are also being developed. PSDR Program members actively collaborate with
members of the MI, MT, and TBM Programs at KCI. Of the 409 manuscripts published from December 2015
to November 2019, 43% and 25% were intra- and inter-programmatic, respectively, and 74% were multi-

National Clinical Trials Network, NCI-funded peer reviewed, investigator-initiated, and industry sponsored
protocols. KCI/WSU is a Lead Academic Participating Site under the NCTN (UG1CA233163). Effective quality
control and training is provided by the CTO to ensure compliance to the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
(DSMP). This includes coordination and administrative support to the Feasibility Review and Operations
Committee (FROC), Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC), the Data and Safety Monitoring
Committee (DSMC) and the Quality Assurance Committee (QAC).
During the current grant period the number of CTO staff increased from 108.85 to 154.45 FTE, providing
CPDM services in support of over 500 active protocols at any one time. The number of Network sites offering
clinical trials increased by 33% resulting in a 6.8-fold increase in accruals to interventional trials at KCI Network
sites (94 in 2015 to 641 in 2019). Strong Network site accruals led to an increase in NRG Lead Academic
Participating Sites (LAPS) trial accrual ranking to #3 for 2019. Efforts toward reduction of protocol activation
times led to a 2.8-fold decrease in median activation time from 213 days in 2017 to 75 days in November of
2019. KCI supports multiple, proactive efforts to promote the recruitment of women and minorities. These
efforts have resulted in exceptional enrollment of minorities and women to interventional trials over the current
grant period with 24.2% accrual of minorities and 58.1% accrual of women in 2019. KCI partners with
Children’s Hospital of Michigan (CHM) to facilitate pediatric accrual to clinical trials. Pediatric cancer specialists
at CHM actively participate as a member institution of the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) (U10CA180886).
The CTO supports robust accrual of participants across the lifespan from pediatric/adolescents to older adults."
10758258,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS) – ABSTRACT
The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) at KCI ensures rigorous review of the scientific merit of
research protocols, prioritization of protocols across the Cancer Center, and monitors progress of all clinical
research. Prior to submission to the PRMC, a first stage review is conducted within each of the Multi-
Disciplinary Teams (MDT), who prioritize protocols within their respective area of expertise and practice. With
respect to prioritization of protocols, the MDT conducts a pre-review of potential protocols for activation to
determine whether they complement the current portfolio of open protocols and whether they should move
forward for submission to the PRMC. The MDT also reviews the protocols for scientific interest and the
likelihood of attaining adequate accrual. This process eliminates redundant reviews by the PRMC and reduces
submission of competing protocols. Although the MDT identifies the prioritization, it is reviewed and confirmed
by the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC). The PRMC fulfills the primary role of the PRMS.
The PRMC is composed of a broad array of complementary expertise with an emphasis on senior investigators
from various disciplines and specialties, as well as representatives from the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics
Core, Pharmacology and Metabolomics Core, the Clinical Trials Office (CTO), the KCI Network, and the
Office of Cancer Health Equity & Community Engagement. The members of the committee represent a
sufficient size and breadth of expertise to conduct a critical and fair scientific review of all clinical research
protocols involving cancer patients at KCI. The PRMC provides internal oversight of the scientific merit of the
cancer trials in addition to assuring that its clinical resources are engaged to ensure the best practices for
scientific endeavors and applications. The function of the PRMC is complementary to that of the IRB, which
focuses on the protection of human subjects. The PRMC is not intended to duplicate or overlap the
responsibilities of the IRB, nor is it intended to perform an auditing or data and safety monitoring function.
Scientific review takes into account the specific rationale, study design, duplication of studies already in
progress elsewhere and at the Cancer Center, adequacy of biostatistical input, and feasibility for completion of
the study within a reasonable time frame. Additionally, the PRMC is responsible for accrual monitoring;
protocols are reviewed regularly to evaluate scientific progress, including accrual rates, to ensure that the
scientific aims of the study are on track for completion in the estimated timeframes indicated at initial
submission."

Astrocytes are the most abundant cell types in the brain and have long been thought as primarily passive support
cells. Studies in the past two decades leveraging modern techniques have revealed crucial roles for astrocytes
in neuronal circuit assembly, synaptic function and behavior. Aberrant astrocytic function is implicated in
neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, and astrocytes hold great promises as novel therapeutic
targets for improving treatment efficacy. Despite this progress, a deeper mechanistic understanding of
astrocytes' causative and correlative roles in operating neural circuitry and their contribution to behavior is still
lacking. This knowledge gap is largely due to the lack of technologies to effectively manipulate astrocyte activity
with cell-type and temporal precision. The physiological hallmark of astrocytes is their complex spatiotemporal
patterns of intracellular and intercellular calcium signaling crucial to their bidirectional interaction with neurons.
The objective of this project is to develop a non-invasive, wireless and genetically encoded actuator to modulate
astrocytic activity with cell-type and temporal precision in vivo. Our approach, named FeRIC (Ferritin iron
Redistribution to Ion Channels), combines the use of radiofrequency (RF) waves and ion channels to control
membrane ion permeability non-invasively and wirelessly. The FeRIC technique utilizes RF waves to activate
membrane proteins that are coupled to the endogenous cellular iron storage protein ferritin. Our preliminary
studies have demonstrated the feasibility of FeRIC-mediated RF stimulation to modulate calcium activities in
astrocytes and astrocytic networks that resembles those observed under physiological conditions. Further,
FeRIC-mediated RF stimulation of astrocytes has been able to elicit neurotransmitter release and evoke action
potentials in connected neurons. We aim to develop a set of molecular tools and characterize their abilities 1) to
modulate global calcium signaling in astrocytes, 2) to modulate microdomain calcium activities in astrocytes and
3) to modulate astrocyte-neuron interactions at the tripartite synapses in vivo. If successful, the project will
develop a non-invasive and genetically encoded molecular tool to modulate astrocytic activity with cell-type and
temporal precision. We will elucidate the biophysical underpinnings of the mechanism. The project will have a
broad impact to the study of the roles of astrocytes in health and disease."
10791876,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Previous studies from our laboratory have suggested that CD169+ macrophages of the bone marrow (BM)
contribute to the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche activity by regulating CXCL12 synthesis in stromal cells and
their retention in the BM. Preliminary results reveal two novel functions of macrophages in directly regulating the
HSC function. First, we provide evidence that macrophages are critical for HSC regeneration after genotoxic
challenge via the regulation of iron availability mediated by signals from the gut microbiota. Second, we have
found that BM macrophages can transfer to HSCs/progenitors key retention signals that confer residence in BM.
Indeed, HSCs that have received the transfer from macrophages are retained in the BM, whereas only those that
have not are mobilized from the BM microenvironment following G-CSF administration. These results raise
important new questions as to whether the various functions of macrophages in regulating HSCs, RBC
production, or clearance are achieved by the same cells or whether the BM macrophages have specialized
functions. In this proposal, we will explore the hypothesis that macrophage can directly contribute to niche
activities by regulating HSCs’ ability to regenerate and to egress from the BM. In Specific Aim 1, we will
investigate how macrophages interact with the microbiota to promote HSC regeneration. We will use genetic
models to manipulate iron delivery pathways in HSCs and macrophages to dissect the mechanism by which iron
is supplied to HSCs/progenitors during hematopoietic regeneration. We will also evaluate how BM macrophages
can sense signals from the microbiota. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate the mechanisms by which
macrophages assign bone marrow residence. We will assess the role of connexins in the cell-cell communication
using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeting and determine the role of trogocytosis as transfer mechanism. In Specific
Aim 3, we will further define the bone marrow-resident macrophage population. We will evaluate the spatial
relationship of these macrophages with vascular structures, HSCs and erythroblasts using immunofluorescence
imaging. We will investigate the origin (embryonic or hematopoietic) of BM- resident macrophages using genetic
tracing methods. These studies will shed light into the critical functions of an under-appreciated component of the
HSC niche and uncover new therapeutic approaches for blood disorders."

 Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive primary brain tumor and is
uniformly fatal with a median survival of around 1.5 years. Like surgery and chemotherapy,
radiation (RT) is a critical treatment for nearly every patient with GBM and has repeatedly
improved patient survival in multiple randomized trials. Still, 80% of GBMs recur within the high
dose RT field. Thus, there is a critical need to develop strategies to overcome GBM RT-
resistance to further improve patient outcomes. GBM cells exhibit profound cancer-specific
metabolic abnormalities, including elevated purine synthesis, to fuel proliferation, invasion and
survival. We have found that the metabolic phenotype of elevated purine synthesis also
mediates resistance to RT in GBM by promoting the repair of RT-induced DNA damage. This
purine-mediated RT resistance can be overcome in preclinical models by mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF), an FDA-approved and CNS-penetrant inhibitor of purine synthesis. In this research
proposal we will determine how the RT response and purine synthesis regulate one another in
GBM. We will also determine if the GBMs with the greatest activity of purine synthesis derive
the greatest benefit from MMF treatment. Finally, we will perform a clinical trial to determine the
maximum tolerated dose of MMF given in combination with RT for patients with GBM and
confirm that this dose reaches active concentrations in GBM tissue. Together, these studies will
(1) Determine mechanistic links between the RT response and purine metabolism in GBM that
will facilitate the rational combination of metabolic inhibitors with DNA damage inducing
therapeutics, (2) Determine whether measuring purine synthesis rates could predict GBM
response to MMF treatment, and (3) Determine whether combined RT and MMF should be
evaluated in randomized trials for patients with GBM."
10808882,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants is a common and often severe lung disease with long
term sequelae. Rates of BPD vary between racial/ethnic groups, which may be due to differences in genetic
ancestry or environment factors. Changes in the biochemical composition of biofluids (the metabolome) reflect
the sum of both genetics and the environment, and thus characterizing these changes offers a broader view of
the disease process as compared to genetic studies alone. Our goal is to increase our understanding of the
biological basis of BPD and response to interventions in genetically diverse preterm infants at high risk of dis-
ease. We hypothesize that there are temporal changes in the urinary and tracheal aspirate (TA) metabolome of
the premature infant that are associated with respiratory outcomes and interventions, and that some of these
changes vary by infant genetic ancestry. We will test our hypothesis with three specific aims. Specific Aim 1:
Longitudinal characterization of the urinary and lung fluid metabolome of preterm infants. We will
measure longitudinal changes in metabolic profiles of urine and tracheal aspirates in two cohorts of preterm
infants at high risk of BPD from three racial/ethnic groups. We will identify changes in the metabolome of
infants that are associated with respiratory status (diagnosis of BPD and later respiratory outcomes) and inter-
ventions (e.g. type of nutrition, iNO therapy, corticosteroids, and other medications). Results from this aim will
provide new information on the biofluid metabolome of preterm infants, biomarkers of disease and response to
interventions, and insight into postnatal lung development and disease pathogenesis. Specific Aim 2:
Examine the contribution of genetic ancestry, race and ethnicity on longitudinal changes in the biofluid
metabolome of preterm infants. We will investigate the contribution of genetic ancestry and maternal self-
reported race/ethnicity on temporal changes in the biofluid metabolome of premature infants. We will identify
metabolites and pathways whose trajectories are associated with genomic ancestry independent of maternal
race/ethnicity, and identify those under stronger genetic vs. social/ environmental determination. Results from
this aim will provide new information as to the role of genetics on the biofluid metabolome of preterm infants as
it relates to racial/ethnic differences in BPD and response to interventions. Specific Aim 3: Integrate genomic
and metabolomic studies of BPD. We will identify novel metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL) in high risk
preterm infants using a two-step approach that leverages variation in local genetic ancestry, and develop a
resource to empower multi-omic studies of BPD. We will then combine this information with a genome-wide
association study (GWAS) of BPD by integrating metabolomic and genomic associations in the same infants to
identify novel genetic loci and biochemical pathways involved in the development and pathogenesis of BPD.
Relevance: Results from this proposal will advance our understanding of disease pathogenesis in high risk
preterm infants, and support the development of biomarkers and precision-targeted therapies."

There is strong evidence for a significant race and gender gap in academia, and first generation graduates face
inequity in becoming tenured faculty. Moreover, Kentucky (KY) is a state with a large economically
disadvantaged population, including first generation/rural graduates, who are underrepresented in STEM fields.
A highly effective approach to remediating the paucity of diversity in STEM is to provide underrepresented
students with the tools they need to apply to and succeed in graduate school. The goal of the University of
Louisville (UofL) Biomedical Integrative Opportunity for Mentored Experience Development-PREP (UL-BIOMED-
PREP) is to train the next generation of underrepresented scientists in STEM fields, including Medicine,
Dentistry, Arts and Sciences, and Engineering. UL-BIOMED-PREP is a unique integrated education program
among these four schools; it will provide students from Kentucky and surrounding areas who are
underrepresented in the STEM fields with extensive mentored development and research opportunities in these
disciplines with access to a large array of scientific projects, tailored courses designed to develop skills that will
prepare students to successfully apply to and complete graduate school, and cohort-building activities geared
toward building resiliency and developing critical thinking and life-long learning skills necessary for becoming a
scientific leader. There are currently no PREP programs in Kentucky and this initiative aligns very well with the
current strategic plan of UofL to pursue inclusiveness in education. Seven to eight UL-BIOMED-PREP scholars
will be recruited from the UofL and regional programs/colleges geared to facilitate achievement of
underrepresented students in STEM, with an emphasis on African American and Latino, first generation
graduates and economically underserved students from both rural and urban areas in KY. A personal
development plan will be developed for each scholar at the start of the program based on individual skills and
needs, that will be re-evaluated regularly. An experienced research mentor will be chosen at the end of two
laboratory rotations, a research committee assigned to evaluate monthly progress, and a student mentor
assigned to provide personalized advising. UL-BIOMED-PREP scholars will present any program outcome
regularly at regional/national meetings and via social media. In addition to courses designed to aid in the
preparation of graduate school applications and complete graduate school, monthly career development
activities will help foster an inclusive community, networking and help scholars develop confidence and a growth
mindset. Internal and External Advisory Committees will regularly evaluate the program and provide ongoing
feedback that will be used to improve the program. Upon program completion, UL-BIOMED-PREP scholars will
possess improved research and analytical skills, a better understanding of graduate school expectations, and
the resiliency and self-confidence to handle the challenging demands of graduate school. Our goal is to reach
the target of 85% of UL-BIOMED-PREP scholars being admitted and completing graduate school."
10767176,"Project Summary
Infant mortality is tracked annually worldwide. Knowledge of causes of infant mortality shapes public health
policy and prioritizes diseases for investments in surveillance, intervention and medical research. As a result,
rates of many causes of infant mortality have declined significantly over the past 50 years. The proposed
research team has pioneered a new way to decrease infant morbidity and mortality associated with 14,000
genetic diseases, called genomic medicine: In it, genome sequencing can provide a genetic disease diagnosis in
as little as 19 hours. Early genetic disease diagnosis in seriously ill infants allows empiric initial treatment to be
replaced with specific evidence-based treatment for that condition. In 9 studies of 681 seriously ill children,
genomic sequencing diagnosed 31%, 21% had consequent changes in treatment, and 13% had changes in
outcome. As a result, genomic medicine is gaining broad acceptance in seriously ill infants. However, for
genomic medicine to decrease infant morbidity and mortality maximally and to anticipate the value of genetic
diagnoses, it is critical to determine the leading genetic causes of infant mortality in the context of other
environmental factors. We propose to use genome sequencing and semi-automated interpretation to identify
genetic diseases associated with 1,000 infant deaths in San Diego County between 2015 and 2022 and to
evaluate potential environmental contributions to those same infant deaths. We will identify potentially
preventable infant deaths by determining those deaths associated with specific genetic diseases for which
targeted interventions are known to reduce mortality. This new knowledge will enable policymakers,
researchers, and clinicians to prioritize those diseases for investments in new, life-saving interventions and
treatments."
10827409,"Core B is proposed to provide three separate but highly integrated functions, including: 1) Standardized sample
processing, genotyping, and immunophenotyping; 2) Reliable, secure, high-quality specimen storage within the
UFDI Study Bank with efficient distribution of samples to investigators; and 3) Functional genomics analyses
using both biostatistical and bioinformatic approaches, with this latter Aim representing a new feature of this
Core to support program-wide syngergy and productivity. Specifically, Core B will ensure that high-quality
peripheral blood specimens are promptly processed to serum, plasma, mononuclear cells (PBMC), and DNA
through adherence to established Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). These samples, as well as induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and gene-edited primary human T cells generated by Projects 2 & 3,
respectively, are stored according to biobanking best practices with barcoded sample tracking as well as
emergency response planning by trained staff. The samples and associated data will be securely managed using
our internal database (Diabase, managed by Core A) that together, tracks sample provenance from the point of
patient consent, through sample and clinical metadata intake, and ultimately, Project data deposition. For all
study specimens, this Core will also continue to perform a series of well-validated assays for immunologic (islet
autoantibodies [AAb] against GAD, IA-2, ZnT8, and insulin; type 1 interferon [T1-IFN] levels using HEK-Blue
reporter cells, complete blood count [CBC], and extensive human immunophenotyping [HIP] by spectral flow
cytometry), metabolic (glucose and HbA1C levels), emerging biomarker (exocrine pancreas enzymes), and
genetic characterization (precision medicine genotyping via our custom Axiom array involving >790K single
nucleotide polymorphism [SNPs]; the UFDIchip). The UFDIchip provides genome-wide coverage for four-digit
HLA resolution, genetic ancestry imputation, calculation of polygenic genetic risk scores (GRS) for type 1
diabetes (T1D), as well as interrogation of known and emerging risk variants. Importantly, these assays will be
performed following clinical laboratory standards, through participation in national/international programs to
assure QA/QC. For example, the Core's performance in the International Autoantibody Standardization Program
(IASP) consistently scores with high sensitivity and specificity. With this, Core B will provide Projects 1, 2 & 3
with uniformly processed samples as well as standardized, high-content, FAIR-compliant datasets that are highly
relevant to the research proposed, in order to optimize multivariable analysis of data generated across the
Program. The UFDI Data Science Team will implement R packages and Shiny applications for pre-processing,
analysis, and integration of single cell multi-omics, high-parameter imaging, and in vitro functional data generated
through the three Projects. Core B will continue to facilitate sharing of genotyping data (dbGAP), software tools
(GitHub, Docker), and samples from the UFDI Study Bank. Each aspect of Core B represents a critical service
in support of the three Projects and ultimately, their successful implementation."
10827413,"Recent evidence put forth by our group and others suggests type 1 diabetes (T1D) pathogenesis involves a
combination of immune, islet, and acinar pancreas defects. Hence, there is a need to understand each of these
facets in concert, linking islet and acinar cell function with precise cellular composition of the insulitis lesion,
throughout T1D progression. We hypothesize that intrinsic β-cell stress triggers innate inflammation resulting in
immune trafficking and localized islet and acinar pathology, culminating in immune-mediated destruction of β-
cells. To address this hypothesis, Project 1 will utilize high parameter imaging to provide deep profiling of
immune and pancreas phenotypes including across projects (SH2B3 [collaboration with Project 2]; HLA class-
II, CD226, and SIRPG [collaboration with Project 3]), and address how immune infiltration affects islet and acinar
cell composition and function. In Aim 1, we propose to perform MACSima ultra high-content imaging to assess
in situ expression of 70 immune and pancreas cell markers, including vascular and lymphatic annotation with
signatures of inflammation, extravasation/trafficking, (collaboration with Project 2) or immune cell residency in
donors with well-characterized insulitis. We will compare inflamed vs non-inflamed islets, within and across
donors, to determine how insulitis correlates with, islet and acinar cell phenotypes. Aim 2 further proposes single
cell multi-omics analysis involving spectral flow cytometry as well as scRNA-Seq with antibody-based CITE-Seq
and paired T cell receptor sequencing (TCR-Seq) for linked transcriptomic, proteomic, and repertoire information
on CD45+ and CD45- cell fractions isolated from freshly acquired organ donor pancreas tissues. The
transcriptomic markers affected in slices with and without insulitis will be correlated to changes in cell status.
Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to assay islet and acinar tissue function using our novel pancreas slice culture
platform. Specifically, we will apply hypothesized diabetogenic conditions (type 1 or 2 interferons, glucotoxicity)
to pancreas slices followed by T cell “avatars” expressing islet antigen-specific TCRs (collaboration with Project
3) to evaluate the impact of this “investigator-initiated insulitis” on pancreas secretory function and cellular
signaling in situ. We will quantitate real time live cellular imaging of Ca2+ signalling activity within islet and acinar
tissue areas from T1D, AAb+, and control organ donor pancreata in response to established endocrine (glucose,
arginine, KCl) and exocrine stimuli (carbachol). Through intermittent sampling of the perifusate, we will also test
(pro)hormone (proinsulin, insulin, glucagon) and enzyme (lipase, trypsin) secretion. We will then correlate these
functional data with molecular features via MACSima imaging and scRNA-Seq/CITE-Seq/TCR-Seq, facilitating
direct correlation of phenotype and function. We expect to identify altered molecular pathways and tissue
features linking immune cell phenotypes with islet and acinar cell function in AAb+ and T1D pancreata. We
anticipate these same defects will arise in slices subjected to investigator-initiated insulitis with diabetogenic
stimuli, providing a platform to test known and novel candidates for targeted immunotherapeutic intervention."
10827419,"Progress toward a cure for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is hampered by the field's knowledge gaps regarding how
complex combinations of risk variants (now >150 loci) precipitate disease progression. This need persists, in
large part, due to a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which individual variants confer
autoimmunity risk in humans. Seroconversion to islet autoantibody (AAb) production is the earliest and most
definitive biological predictor of T1D progression. Thus, the events precipitating destructive β-cell autoimmunity
are linked to development of islet AAb. In high-risk HLA subjects, islet AAb seroconversion was associated with
four additional loci converging on genes/proteins that regulate three cell signaling pathways (RAS/MAPK,
PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT) that are essential for activation and sustaining immune responses. The T1D-risk
variant rs3184504 is a missense mutation within exon 3 of SH2B3 (C>T, R262W), which encodes LNK, a
negative regulator of signaling that impacts all three of these immune response pathways. In Project 2, we
hypothesize that the LNK T1D-risk allotype fails to suppress inflammatory signal transduction pathways that
engender autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells. Specifically, we postulate that the SH2B3 risk allele is
a hypomorph, and the actions of the risk allotype impact multiple cell types that participate in T1D pathogenesis.
We propose two specific aims utilizing a novel isogenic experimental platform to isolate SH2B3/LNK onto
predefined human genetic backgrounds to reduce the impact of epistasis from other T1D-risk loci that may further
modify these inflammatory signaling pathways. Aim 1 will interrogate the pathogenic effects of the LNK risk
allotype in innate antigen presenting cells (APCs) and the impact of these APCs in potentiating autoreactive T
cell function, using T cell “avatars” generated in collaboration with Project 3. Aim 2 will establish the roles of
LNK allotypes on endothelial cell (EC) inflammatory activation in enhanced recruitment of autoreactive T cells to
the pancreas to elicit insulitis and β-cell destruction, with studies utilizing human pancreas tissues characterized
in collaboration with Project 1. Our approach is innovative because it employs induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs), generated from UFDI Study Bank samples (acquired and characterized by Cores A & B), that will be
differentiated into multiple cell types of interest (dendritic cells [DCs], macrophages [MΦ], or EC). Paired with
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, the iPSC platform allows us to precisely decipher the effects of individual T1D risk
gene variants on an isogenic background, including SH2B3 as proposed here and genes of interest for Project
3 (CD226 and SIRPG). The proposed research is significant because it is expected to lead to discovery of
mechanisms underlying the earliest break in immune tolerance to β-cell antigens and will enable us to
systematically catalog allele-specific effects of disease-associated gene variants. By understanding the
mechanistic role of SH2B3/LNK in immune functions, future studies will build upon this knowledge by developing
therapies that target specific cellular pathways or effector molecules to prevent or reverse T1D autoimmunity."
10827426,"The adaptive arm of the human immune system provides exquisite protection from pathogens, but the highly
variable receptors can turn on self-tissues when immunoregulatory checkpoints are broken due to genetic risk
and inflammatory events. A breakdown in tolerance impacting T cells is thought to be a critical immune
checkpoint during the natural history of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Of the approximately 150 independent loci
identified by genome-wide association studies as contributing to polygenic T1D risk, the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) remains the largest factor conferring risk due to its influence over thymic selection of the T cell
receptor (TCR) repertoire and impact on peripheral T cell activation. Despite this critical link, little is known about
how high-risk alleles like HLA-DR4 impact TCR selection, activation thresholds, and distribution across tissues.
Our compelling preliminary data suggest that the risk-associated DR4/DQ8 haplotype, which has been linked
with insulin autoreactivity, is hyper-expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and associated
with a unique TCR signature. Additional gene variants impacting T cell co-stimulation and differentiation are also
enriched in subjects with T1D, yet their mechanistic contributions toward T1D autoimmunity remain poorly
characterized. Project 3 proposes to address knowledge gaps governing these key aspects influencing the TCR
repertoire and activation requirements in health and disease. We hypothesize that MHC risk, and additional
non-MHC protein-coding risk variants, lead to aberrant T cell activation and differentiation thresholds and result
in the loss of T cell tolerance in T1D. Specifically, T1D-associated risk variants alter the functional avidity of the
MHC:peptide:TCR complex, and risk variants in the molecules SIRPG and CD226 alter T cell signaling, resulting
in activation of autoreactive effector T cells as well as defective immunoregulation by regulatory T cells (Treg).
These studies aim to investigate the mechanisms by which MHC class II (Aim 1) and non-MHC risk variants
(Aim 2) control autoreactive T cells through the analysis of pancreatic draining lymph nodes (pLN), spleen, and
peripheral blood from subjects with T1D and those at-risk for disease development (collected through Core A).
We will leverage polygenic risk scoring and broad immunophenotyping data generated by Core B to direct case
selection and analysis with state-of-the-art single-cell profiling and focused functional assays utilizing both
genotype-selected and gene-edited samples. To investigate individual clones and risk alleles, we will modify
primary human T cell specificity and function through lentiviral gene expression systems and CRISPR/Cas9
genome engineering for use in ex vivo pancreas slice culture and in vitro isogenic cellular modeling systems, in
collaboration with Projects 1 & 2, respectively. Data from this Project are expected to inform on the T cell
activation checkpoints involved in T1D pathogenesis, linking pathogenic clones and phenotypes in lymphatics to
peripheral blood, ultimately, to develop biomarkers of disease progression and identify pathway-targeted
therapeutic interventions to halt the autoimmune destruction of β-cells in T1D."

10884097,"Abstract
Mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction are early pathological features and a driving force of
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Aβ is found to accumulate abnormally in the brains of AD
individuals and in an AD mouse models leading to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and activation of
mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Prolonged opening of mPTP triggers outer
mitochondrial membrane rupture, release of cytochrome c and activation of downstream cell
death pathways. The mPTP has been at the center of extensive scientific research for the last
several decades but it still remains as one of the most mysterious phenomena in biology today
due to its controversial molecular composition and the lack of structural information of its pore.
We have recently demonstrated the novel role of ATP synthase c-subunit ring in forming the
channel of mPTP. Nevertheless, the gating mechanism of the ATP synthase c-subunit leak
channel and conformational changes initiating its opening are yet to be discovered.
In this proposal, we will use single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to identify the high-
resolution structure and the open conformation of ATP synthase leak channel in the presence of
channel modulators. We will also perform in situ structural analysis of ATP synthase in its
functional environment within the Aβ-exposed primary hippocampal neurons and in mitochondria
isolated from the mouse models of AD by using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). In this project
we will also investigate the direct role of ATP synthase leak channel as a novel cell death pathway
in AD pathogenesis; we will test whether the pharmacological inhibition of this channel will rescue
neurons from Aβ-induced cell death. Successful completion of this proposal will reveal the
molecular mechanism(s) of mitochondrial permeability transition, the atomic structure of ATP
synthase leak channel, and will aid in the development of new treatments for AD, targeting ATP
synthase."
10788316,"MULTI-OMICS CORE C SUMMARY
This PPG is addressing an important hypothesis that early life stress (ELS) leads to reprogramming throughout
the body resulting in an increased risk of developing CVD in adulthood. The mechanistic links between ELS and
CVD and resilience in adulthood is not established. Epigenetic regulation of transcription or the gut microbiome
and microbial-derived factors are hypothesized to be sensitive to ELS and may be modifiable to mediate
resiliency. The primary goal and function of the Multi-omics Core (Core C) is to provide start-of-the-art processing
of samples for determination of transcriptomes, DNA methylomes, DNA chromatin accessibility, metabolomes,
and microbiomes required by all Projects. The objective of the Core is to provide consistency and rigor in the
multi-omics experiments and provide innovative technologies to meet the goals of the Projects. The specific aims
of Core C are: Aim 1 Transcriptomic and epigenomic determination. The epigenome is an important
connection between the environment and the genes expressed in each cell (transcriptomes) and it is regulated
by DNA methylation and chromatin structure (accessibility). Core C will facilitate determination of transcriptomes,
and epigenome global DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility for the Projects. Aim 2: Microbiome and
metabolite profiling. In this PPG, it is hypothesized that ELS results in gut microbial diversity changes that
result in significant alterations to circulating short chain fatty acids (SCFA) or other metabolites. Core C will
prepare samples for microbiome 16S sequencing for identifying and quantifying microbial diversity. The Core
will also prepare samples for SCFA and untargeted metabolite determination by mass spectrometry. Aim 3:
Evaluating new technologies, optimization while promoting fiscal responsibility. In this era of multi-omics,
technologies are rapidly evolving. Thus, to provide the Projects with the latest technologies to test their
hypotheses, Core C will evaluate new technological platforms. Core C will optimize all protocols for sample
preparation for the multi-omics approaches listed above. By centralizing the mutli-omic sample preparation in
Core C, we will purchase kits and reagents in bulk leading to substantial cost savings. Core C will interact directly
with all Projects, receive clinical samples from Core B, and work directly with Core A for sample identification,
curating, data deposition and analyses, and data management. Core A will complete all bioinformatics and
biostatistical analyses for data generated in Core C. The approaches used in Core C ensure that the PPG is
using the latest technologies for determining mechanisms of ELS induced cardiovascular disease risk with a
bench to beside approach."
10788328,"PROJECT 3 SUMMARY
Early life stress (ELS) was strongly linked with adult-onset cardiovascular disease (CVD) over 20 years ago but
remains an under-appreciated CVD risk factor. More than half of U.S. adults report ELS exposures such as
household dysfunction, abuse, or neglect in childhood. Our publications have shown that adults with ELS have
increased indicators for future CVD risk, including casual blood pressure (BP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and
circulating pro-inflammatory factors. Projects 1 and 2 show that animal models of ELS have hypertension
sensitization, increased sympathetic drive, vascular dysfunction, and activation of pro-inflammatory
macrophages that are known drivers of CVD risk. There are gaps in our knowledge of how ELS affects indicators
for future CVD risk in adolescence, and whether the same pathways in animal models of ELS are associated
with CVD risk in people. Therefore, the principal focus of Project 3 is to address these gaps during
adolescence to identify critical clinical features and molecular pathways in ELS-associated CVD risk, with the
potential to guide early interventions to prevent or mitigate CVD. Our preliminary data further support the
rationale for Project 3, showing that adolescents with ELS have increased vascular stiffness and ambulatory
diastolic BP along with pro-inflammatory metabolite patterns in plasma and gene methylation patterns in
circulating monocytes. The central hypothesis of Project 3 is that ELS promotes vascular stiffness and
abnormal ambulatory BP in adolescents through pro-inflammatory reprogramming of the circulating metabolome
and monocyte epigenome. Our cross-sectional study design utilizes comprehensive cardiovascular and multi-
omics profiling in racially diverse adolescent girls and boys in Alabama. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
adolescents exposed to ELS will have increased vascular stiffness and ambulatory blood pressure. Collaborative
experiments will also compare differences in CVD risk indicators in adolescents (Project 3) vs. adults (Project
4) and study heart rate and BP variability as surrogates for increased sympathetic drive along with Project 2.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that ELS is associated with pro-inflammatory patterns in the plasma metabolome
and monocyte epigenome in adolescents. Collaborative experiments will specifically focus on short chain fatty
acids (SCFA) and methylation of HDAC9 and NOX2 genes as in animal models of ELS from Projects 1 and 2.
We will integrate our metabolome and methylome data in adolescents with complementary microbiome,
metabolome, and transcriptome data in adults from Project 4 to discover new multi-omic pathways that link ELS
with vascular dysfunction from adolescence to adulthood. Project 3 is conceptually innovative by testing our
central hypothesis in adolescents to help identify targets for future intervention studies to prevent ELS-associated
CVD. The proposed work has translational relevance by applying basic science discoveries from Projects 1 and
2 (SCFA-associated vascular dysfunction, pro-inflammatory gene methylation patterns, and increased
sympathetic drive) to develop the central hypothesis and aims."
10783714,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sexual minority men (SMM) experience intimate partner violence (IPV) at alarming rates. Prior work has linked IPV
to sexual risk-taking behavior and increased risk for HIV seroconversion among SMM, but less is known about the
impact of IPV on HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing/acquisition, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
uptake, and the persistence of PrEP use among SMM. While these findings reveal the potential for IPV to have a
strong deleterious effect on HIV prevention, experiences of IPV are so varied among SMM (e.g., frequency,
severity; steady vs. casual partnerships; mutual perpetration vs. only perpetrating or receiving violence; sexual vs.
physical vs. psychological violence) that additional research is needed to unpack the overall association between
IPV and HIV risk before effective interventions can be developed. Guided by a framework that combines the
Syndemics and Minority Stress theories, the proposed innovative observational cohort study will examine how
perpetration and/or receipt of various forms of IPV (e.g., physical, sexual, and psychological; in the context of
steady or casual intimate relationships) contribute to HIV risk and protective behaviors among HIV-negative SMM
over a 24-month timeframe in order to: 1. Examine the longitudinal associations of IPV with HIV testing, PrEP
uptake, PrEP persistence, STI diagnosis, condomless anal sex, and HIV seroconversion. 2. Determine the
structural- and individual-level and resilience and risk factors that may buffer or amplify associations between IPV
and these HIV risk and protective behaviors. 3. Identify the characteristics of SMM, their intimate partners, and the
relationship dynamics that serve to mediate or moderate the impact of IPV on HIV risk and protective behaviors. 4.
Make recommendations for interventions that interrupt the pathways between IPV and HIV risk based on
quantitative data from the cohort, and qualitative data guided by technical experts. We will assess sexual risk
behavior, conduct HIV and STI testing, and assess PrEP uptake and persistence over the 24 months of follow-up.
We hypothesize that greater frequency of IPV will be associated with history of childhood abuse, mental health
problems, substance use, sexual risk taking and lower levels of HIV testing, PrEP uptake, and PrEP persistence.
We anticipate that alcohol and substance use among participants and their partners will be highly associated with
episodes of IPV (both victimization and perpetration) and with HIV risk behavior. We also hypothesize that coping
skills and social support will moderate the effects of IPV on risk behavior, HIV testing, PrEP uptake, and PrEP
persistence. The proposed study will advance our understanding of both the risk and resiliency factors relevant to
preventing and reducing IPV, reducing IPV-associated risk behaviors, and increasing HIV protective behaviors
among SMM. This research will inform the development and adaptation of IPV, HIV, and substance abuse
interventions for SMM."
10781902,"Title: The function of SCN2A in autism spectrum disorder
Project Summary: Mutations identified by exome sequencing demonstrate that disruption of
the sodium channel SCN2A is strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder. SCN2A
encodes the neuronal sodium channel NaV1.2, which is expressed at the site of action potential
initiation. More recently, we have discovered that these channels are likely expressed
throughout neocortical excitatory neuron dendrites, and that their dendritic function may be
consequential to synaptic maturation and plasticity. Here, we will use a complement of
electrophysiology, 2-photon imaging, and compartmental modeling to determine how
heterozygous and homozygous loss of function of Scn2a affects the integrative properties of
neurons. Furthermore, we will use novel mouse models and genetic techniques to ask whether
changes in Scn2a expression levels in particular cell classes and developmental stages alters
neuronal function. Results of this study will provide critical insight into how mutations in SCN2A
contributes to autism spectrum disorder and the activity dependent development of cortical
circuits."

Summary statement
Artificial intelligence (AI) has penetrated many scientific disciplines, including medicine. AI is fast gaining
reputation as a highly promising solution for cervical cancer screening. AI-based detection of cervical
neoplasias is named automated visual exam (AVE) by the US NCI. Despite the availability of effective
screening, triage and treatment methods for cervical pre-cancer, cervical cancer elimination is still elusive in
low and middle income countries (LMICs) where the great majority of disease prevails. We propose to
develop and evaluate the performance characteristics of a novel AI system to both screen and triage women
as well as help in treatment decision making. AI will analyse infrared spectroscopic signals derived from urine
samples of unscreened women for the presence of high-risk Human Papillomavirus (hr-HPV). Our preliminary
study has shown that spectroscopy can detect hr-HPV in urine. For screen-positive women the AI will interpret
a set of cervical images captured with a high-quality devoted camera to detect high grade cervical precancers
and cancers and to determine the type of transformation zone (TZ) (helps in treatment decision). The
prototype device for image capture and the AI algorithms are already developed by us. The technologies will
be further improved in phase 1 (initial 2 years) and validated in phase 2 (subsequent 3 years). During phase
1, we will analyse urine samples collected from 2000 women at multiple screening clinics in Zimbabwe for
the presence of hr-HPV using spectroscopy and use the signals generated to improve the AI algorithm. In
this phase we will also assess the concordance between hr-HPV detection in urine samples using
spectroscopy and cervical HPV detection using a validated HPV test. The cervical image recognition device
and the AI algorithm will be further improved during phase 1 by collecting more images from hr-HPV positive
and negative women. AI will also be trained to interpret the cervical images to determine the TZ type. In
phase 2 total 3800 women will be screened in Zimbabwe with AI-supported spectroscopic analysis of urine
to detect hrHPV and a validated HPV test to evaluate and compare their sensitivity and specificity to detect
histology-proved high grade cervical precancers and cancers. The sensitivity and specificity of AI-supported
detection of cervical neoplasias on cervical images will be evaluated to triage the HPV positive women. The
accuracy of AI to determine TZ type will be compared with expert opinion. During the field validation phase
(phase 2), we will also conduct a cost analysis and compare cost of our approach to current standard
Zimbabwean practice. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (WHO cancer research
organization) has partnered with The Neo Sense Vector Company (NSV), Delaware, USA (industry), The
Engineering Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK and The University of Zimbabwe, College of
Health Sciences, Harare, Zimbabwe to implement this study focusing on innovation that will greatly contribute
to the global elimination of cervical cancer, a WHO priority."
10816412,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Clamping and cutting the umbilical cord is the most common intervention in humans, occurring in 140 million
annual births. To maximize expediency (manage 3rd stage of labor, initiate neonatal resuscitation), early cord
clamping (ECC) is performed within ~30 sec of delivery. Recently, evidence has emerged on the health benefits
of delayed cord clamping (DCC, waiting ~1-2 min before clamping). Among term neonates, multiple randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that DCC transfers blood from placentas to newborns, resulting in less iron-
deficiency anemia and improved neurodevelopmental (neuromotor) outcomes through 4 years, than with ECC.
Despite advantages for healthy newborns, in view of their exclusion from previous RCTs, the best approach to
cord clamping in higher-risk pregnancies, notably those complicated by a fetal diagnosis of critical congenital
heart disease (CCHD), remains uncertain. Although one might assume that the benefits of DCC in low-risk new-
born populations would translate simply to CCHD neonates, unique anatomic and physiologic differences in
neonates with CCHD suggest that risks of DCC in this subgroup may differ from risks in neonates without CCHD.
Thus, a treatment dilemma exists on the optimal cord clamping practice at birth among CCHD neonates. The
proposed study, entitled CORD-CHD (Clamp OR Delay among neonates with Congenital Heart Disease) trial
will be the first RCT to determine the effectiveness of DCC vs. ECC on postnatal and neurodevelopmental
outcomes of CCHD neonates. Our preliminary data demonstrate that, among CCHD neonates, DCC results in
lower global rank scores (GRS), indicative of better health outcomes, than ECC. GRS is a validated composite
measure, based upon the worst outcome post-cardiac surgery or catheterization and reflects the need for com-
plex intensive care. Given the absence of high-quality data, maternal outcomes will also be determined. We will
leverage a network of sites with requisite infrastructures, established guidelines with high adherence rates and
treatment fidelity, and track records of collaboration. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that, among CCHD neonates,
DCC results in lower GRS (better outcomes) post-cardiac surgery or catheterization, based on a higher win-odds
(win-ratio adapted to include ties), than with ECC. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that, among neonates with
CCHD, DCC will result in better neuromotor outcomes at 22-26mos postnatal, based on a joint test of a bivariate
outcome (Developmental Assessment of Young Children Second Edition motor score and the Hammersmith
Neonate Neurological Exam) than with ECC. As a secondary objective, we will test the hypothesis that among
CCHD neonates improved neuromotor profiles (General Movement Assessment) at 3-4mos mediate improved
neuromotor outcomes at 22-26mos. Aim 3 is to precisely estimate the difference in the risk of maternal postpar-
tum hemorrhage between DCC and ECC to evaluate safety among mothers who give birth to CCHD neonates.
This trial will advance the care of CCHD neonates and provide the evidence called for by national and interna-
tional organizations, creating a global impact on umbilical cord management among a vulnerable population."
10758609,"Project Summary
Glaucoma is the most prevalent cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. It is estimated that it affects over 3
million Americans and more than 100,000 are blind from this incurable disease. Often, the primary insult in
glaucoma is elevated eye pressure, which leads to optic neuropathy and damage to the axons of retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs). RGCs are the output neurons of the retina that carry all visual information to other brain
regions; their death results in loss of visual function. Current treatment options are focused on addressing
elevated intraocular pressure. While this and similar interventions can delay the progression of glaucoma, even
with optimal treatment, some visual deficits occur, and vision loss is irreversible. Therefore, there is a critical
need for early detection and treatment aimed at neuroprotection.
Animal models have proven to be instrumental in understanding the neuropathology of RGC death. Among
them, a mouse model of optic nerve crush (ONC) is of particular note because it leads to precisely timed
degeneration of RGCs. Mice, like humans, have multiple RGC subtypes that differ in morphology, are
embedded in separate neural circuits, and provide distinct visual functions. For reasons that have not yet been
identified, many injury types disproportionately affect some RGC subtypes. Understanding the factors that
promote cell survival is essential to design strategies to improve disease management.
The goal of this proposal is to analyze the role of glutamatergic NMDA receptors to pathological changes in
individual RGCs belonging to different subtypes. NMDA receptors are known mediators of calcium overload,
excitotoxicity, and their abnormal activation can lead to cell death via multiple pathways. We will take an
innovative approach that combines biophysically realistic modeling, electrophysiology, as well as glutamate
and calcium imaging to provide a detailed description of the changes in the structure and function of RGCs
subjected to traumatic damage. We will focus on the physiological status and responsiveness to stimulation in
the injured neuron. This will enable us to elucidate the differences in the metabolic state of the cells and the
contribution of parameters associated with the neuronal activity to visual deficits and prognosis.
The proposed research will substantially advance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in neuronal
responses to damage. The lessons learned in RGC populations will be combined and integrated to develop a
comprehensive theoretical description of the impact of neuronal activity on survival after an insult and readily
generalized to provide further understanding of other neuropathological conditions. Finally, our research will
identify novel targets for potential neuroprotective interventions to preserve visual function."
10735892,"ABSTRACT
 Chlamydia species represent a paradigm for understanding successful obligate intracellular
parasitism. While C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae are both prevalent human pathogens, C.
pneumoniae respiratory infections are likely most common. Acute C. pneumoniae infections
manifest as community acquired pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis while additional
inflammatory sequelae are associated with chronic infection. Advances in genetic tractability
have facilitated considerable progress in characterizing C. trachomatis pathogenesis.
Unfortunately, similar progress has lagged for C. pneumoniae, leading to a paucity in details
regarding molecular mechanisms of infection and precluding informative approaches leveraging
comparative studies. To overcome this barrier, we will engineer plasmid systems enabling allelic
replacement and ectopic gene expression for C. pneumoniae. These new technologies will be
applied in proof-of-principle studies to address functional aspects manifested by a pair of
divergent type III secreted effectors employed by C. pneumoniae to manipulate host cell
biology. At the end of these studies, we will have established new approaches that will benefit
the entire Chlamydia research community and advance the understanding of how chlamydial
species have evolved to accomplish common developmental requirements."
10778608,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The retina is a cellularly complex tissue comprised of over 100 different cell types which work together to
enable proprer vision. Bipolar cells are a diverse class of interneurons that connect rod and cone
photoreceptors to retinal ganglion cells, the projection neurons of the retina, which then in turn send their
output to the brain. There are currently 15 known subtypes of bipolar cells that differ in their connectivity,
physiological responses to light, morphology, abundance, and gene expression profiles. A recent
developmental study from our lab performed birthdating analysis to determine when different bipolar cell
subtypes were born and found that bipolar cell subtype genesis was arranged into concentrated domains that
changed over developmental time. When these domains were compared over time, they formed a wave-like
temporospatial pattern of bipolar subtype genesis that spread over the entire extent of the retina. This result
suggests a hierarchical model of bipolar subtype genesis in which early retinal progenitor cells generate a
series of sub-lineages off-set in developmental time, that undergo a temporally ordered production of bipolar
subtypes. To investigate this potential model, I have invented a novel molecular tool called SCRIBE
(Sequential Combinatorial Recorder for Iterative Barcode Evolution) that functions as an “evolvable” lineage
recorder. By iteratively adding barcode fragments to a genomic target site, SCRIBE aims to generate an
evolving, heritable sequence that can be used to distinguish between sister sub-lineages across multiple levels
of a clonal lineage tree. The goal of this proposal is to investagate how bipolar cell subtype specification is
achieved in development. During the mentored portion of this proposal (K99), I will further develop SCRIBE for
use in the in vivo retina and use it to investagate the temporal ordering of bipolar subtype production and the
lineage relationships between postnatal RPCs that generate bipolar cells. In the independent portion of the
proposal (R00), I will determine whether bipolar subtype specification is intrinsic or extrinsic, and investigate
potential molecular regulators of bipolar subtypes specification. The completion of these aims will provide me
with training in the fields of retinal development and cutting-edge molecular tool development, complementing
my previous training experiences. I will perform the mentored portion of this proposal under the supervision of
Dr. Constance Cepko who has been a leader in the fields of retinal development, lineage tracing, and in vivo
molecular tool development. Furthermore, the broader scientific environment surrounding the Cepko lab at
Harvard Medical School will provide outstanding training opportunities. Together, these experiences will
provide me with a solid foundation that will support my long-term career goal of leading my own independent
academic laboratory focused on studying the molecular bases of cellular diversity in the retina."

needs. Building upon promising pilot results, this project seeks to evaluate components of the Swift Outpatient
Alternative for Rapid Stabilization (SOARS) intervention to build the strongest combination to reduce youth
suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB; Aim 1). We will test the impact patient characteristics (Aim 2) and if
SOARS components function through their putative mechanisms. The optimized treatment package will be
refined through co-design with providers to augment its acceptability and usability (Aim 4). Results will be
used to create an optimized intervention package to accelerate the pace of adoption by healthcare systems

ecological validity, effectiveness and efficiency, and ready for evaluation in a hybrid implementation trial."
10791830,"ABSTRACT. Death by suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among young adults in the United States.
While most patients who die by suicide have had recent contact with their health care providers, the medical
delivery system is poorly equipped to address this preventable issue. Risk of suicide is not detected or
addressed in the majority of cases, particularly in health care settings serving low income and racially and
ethnically diverse populations. In this R34 study we utilize human centered design (HCD) supported by the
Center Methods Core to study how Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) based signals of suicide risk can
be utilized in primary health care for Risk Detection, Assessment, Shared Decision-Making and Long-Term
Surveillance. Patient and provider partner input is needed to design a system that has utility to the care of this
population. EMA systems show promise as indicators of suicide risk and a means of enhancing existing
resources in the primary care setting. However, little is known about how to apply these methods in the context
of clinical care, nor is it apparent to what extent patients would agree to use EMA for risk prediction and
monitoring. Through principles of HCD we propose to create a clinically actionable pathway for EMA derived
signals of suicide risk that is acceptable to both young adult patients and their health care providers. We plan
to carry out two specific aims to address this issue: (Aim 1) co-design a suicide risk monitoring system,
Augmented Momentary Personal Ecological Risk Evaluation (AMPERE), with patients and health care
providers through HCD and (Aim 2) conduct a pilot study of acceptability and usability of the prototype
AMPERE suicide risk detection and response system as well as patient outcomes and our putative
mechanisms of patient and provider self-efficacy and therapeutic alliance. Our goal in this study is to co-design
a critical pathway for EMA from an innovative evidence-based suicide risk detection strategy to an acceptable
and usable clinical tool that has potential for other effective risk detection strategies to follow."
10767805,"The purpose of this proposal is to improve public health through renewal of an NIH-supported large-scale network of prehospital and hospital care (called SIREN) created 5 years ago. This network that will continue to oversee the conduct of pragmatic clinical trials addressing emergency medical conditions affecting brain, heart, lung and/or blood as well as life-threatening trauma. The components of this proposal locally include the University of Washington and its Harborview and University Medical Centers (as “Hub”) in concert with King County Emergency Medical Services (KCEMS). This “Hub” will both participate in these clinical trials and provide administrative and academic oversight and leadership over additional community-based facilities in the Pacific Northwest, and an additional academic facility (the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC), which will serve as enrolling sites (or “Spokes”) for the conduct of these clinical trials. This proposal does not involve nor seek approval for the conduct of the clinical trials themselves. Rather it strictly creates the network infrastructure for these trials. These trials themselves require independent regulatory approval which will continue to occur through a previously established Central Institutional Review Board (ADVARRA) to which the University of Washington Institutional Review Board has previously ceded oversight upon creation of the SIREN network 5 years ago."
10752654,"Abstract
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) disorder is one of the most prevalent mental health conditions among
youth and the majority are cared for in primary care. Prior work indicates that youth with ADHD have poorer
functioning than youth without ADHD. The Institute of Medicine emphasizes the importance of family
engagement during visits. Simple interventions that are easy to implement are needed to engage youth and
parents more during ADHD pediatric visits. We were one of the first research teams to use question prompt
lists with youth. We found that a youth asthma question prompt list/video intervention significantly increased
youth question-asking and provider education. We also found that youth who received the intervention and
asked their providers questions were significantly more likely to have improved asthma control at 12 months.
We propose to test having both youth and parents receive an ADHD question prompt list and watch a short
video on the importance of being involved in ADHD visits. The rationale for having prompt lists for both youth
and parents is that in contrast to asthma visits where parents tended to ask questions and youth did not, in our
prior ADHD work, very few youth or parents asked questions. Yet, youth reported having an average of 8
questions about ADHD and parents an average of 8.9 questions. Using Social Cognitive Theory as a guide, we
propose to conduct a pilot randomized controlled feasibility trial of the intervention. We will enroll 140 English-
speaking youth ages 11-17 with an ADHD medical record diagnosis who screen as having predominantly
inattentive subtype, hyperactive/impulsive subtype, or combined inattention/hyperactivity on the Vanderbilt
assessment scale from three pediatric clinics. We will randomize the families to receive both the question
prompt lists and video (N=35), just the question prompt lists (N=35), just the video (N=35), or usual care
(N=35). This will allow us to understand whether both the video and question prompt list parts are needed in
the larger trial. The aims of our trial will be: (1) To examine whether the ADHD question prompt lists and/or pre-
visit video significantly impact the proposed mechanisms of the intervention. We will investigate whether
adolescents and parents in each of the intervention groups: (a) ask more questions and receive more provider
education about ADHD during their baseline and 3 month visits and (b) have higher self-efficacy at 3 and 6
months than adolescents and parents in the usual care group. (2) To investigate the effectiveness of the ADHD
question prompt lists and/or the pre-visit video by examining whether adolescents in each of the intervention
groups have improved ADHD symptoms, school and social performance, and quality-of-life at 6 months
compared to those in the usual care group. (3) Assess adolescent, parent, and provider feedback on the
acceptability, feasibility, tolerability, and safety of using the ADHD question prompt lists and/or the pre-visit
video. The results from this pilot trial will be used to: (a) identify the intervention arm with the greatest potential
impact and (b) determine the best mechanisms and outcome variables to assess in a larger trial."
10984975,"Current therapeutics for neuropathic pain are poorly efficacious. One likely reason is that current therapies target only a single biochemical mechanism or pathway while chronic pain is a multi-mechanism problem. Fumarates, such as monomethyl fumarate (MMF), are uniquely positioned to treat the multi-mechanism problem of pain due to their combined antioxidant and anti-inflammatory profile. However, the risk-benefit ratio of fumarates is unacceptable for treatment of chronic pain, given their poor gastrointestinal tolerability and indiscriminate immune interference. This research project proposes to build on the documented analgesic efficacy of fumarates by designing new MMF prodrugs that have improved tolerability through design of non-reactive prodrugs. To reduce systemic immune interference, prodrugs will further be designed to preferentially release MMF, the active metabolite, only where ROS/RNS are overproduced in the pain neuraxis. The overall objective is to develop a 1,2-dicarbonyl prodrug that preferentially releases MMF at sites of pathology to alleviate neuropathic pain, while reducing adverse effects caused by systemic distribution of fumarates. Preliminary data indicate that the antioxidant master regulator nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a major therapeutic target. Using validated NRF2 activators and standard of care therapeutics as comparators, the UG3 specific aims are: 1) Complete initial characterization of the lead 1,2-dicarbonyl MMF prodrug; 2) Optimize lead compound, and design and evaluate backup 1,2-dicarbonyl MMF prodrugs; and 3) Characterize safety, validate analgesic efficacy of lead and backup 1,2-dicarbonyl MMF prodrugs. The exploratory milestones will identify a lead and backup molecules. These compounds will be advanced through IND-enabling studies under the following UH3 phase specific aims: 4) Extensive PK/PD characterization of candidates; 5) demonstrate in vivo efficacy in established rodent models of neuropathic pain; 6) Dose range finding to establish maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal safety and toxicity studies; and 7) establish a Lead Development Team to finalize an IND application. BPN resources will be engaged for CMC manufacture and scale up, and development of a phase 1 clinical trial plan. Successful completion of this project will have major impact by first-in-class target activated delivery of a non-opioid therapeutic agent (MMF) to localized regions of pain pathology. Site-specific release of MMF will reduce its adverse effects, eliminating the final hurdles to MMF- based treatment of neuropathic pain."
10764194,"Osteoporosis is a disease of aging that leads to ~2 million fractures and ~$17 billion in healthcare costs
annually. Although several drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of osteoporosis, the potential for serious
side effects (e.g., osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femur fractures) has led most physicians to use these
drugs only for the treatment, but not the prevention, of osteoporosis. This has led to the current situation where
most postmenopausal women must wait until they develop frank osteoporosis (i.e., fractures, or sufficiently
high fracture risk) to begin drug therapy. As such, there is a compelling need for novel, relatively low-risk and
low-cost pharmacological approaches to prevent osteoporosis.
 The current proposal aims to translate evidence from rodent studies showing that the sympathetic nervous
system (SNS) is an important regulator of bone metabolism to a simple, cost-effective, and safe approach for
osteoporosis prevention. In key Preliminary Data, we obtained multiple lines of evidence to establish clearly the
role of the SNS in regulating human bone metabolism. A critical component of these data was a “proof-of-
concept” interventional study demonstrating that β1-selective blockers (atenolol, nebivolol), but not a non-
selective β-AR blocker (propranolol), have favorable effects on bone turnover and bone mineral density (BMD)
in postmenopausal women. Based on these data, we will perform a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled 2 year clinical trial addressing the following Specific Aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that treatment
with a widely used, inexpensive, and relatively β1-selective blocker (atenolol) will prevent bone loss at the
lumbar spine and femur neck as assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 420 postmenopausal
women without pre-existing osteoporosis (Aim 1a); and evaluate the tolerability and safety of atenolol when
used for the prevention of bone loss (Aim 1b). (2) Evaluate the effects of atenolol on trabecular and cortical
bone microarchitecture using high resolution-peripheral quantitative computed tomography (Aim 2a), on bone
turnover markers (Aim 2b), and test whether baseline measures of bone turnover or of sympathetic activity
(resting heart rate, plasma catecholamine levels) are predictive of the BMD response to atenolol over 2 years
(Aim 2c). (3) In a subset of patients, explore the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms for the effects
of β1-selective blockade on bone in humans using analyses of osteoblast populations isolated from bone
biopsies as well as tissue-level bone formation rates on quadruple-labelled bone biopsies (Aim 3).
 The proposed studies will rigorously test whether atenolol is efficacious and safe for the prevention of
osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and also further define the mechanisms of SNS effects on bone in
humans. If our proposed clinical trial demonstrates protection from bone loss in postmenopausal women by
atenolol, this would fill a crucial clinical need, as these women currently have virtually no pharmacological
options for osteoporosis prevention."
10755294,"Fusion of membrane bound vesicles with a target membrane is of ubiquitous importance for cellular function
from intracellular trafficking to exocytotic release of various mediators from a wide range of different cell types.
The mechanisms of exocytosis and their regulation are the central topic of the research program in my
laboratory. Exocytotic release occurs from the interior of secretory vesicles to the outside of the cell via
formation of a fusion pore. The SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment REceptor) complex, which in mammalian
neurons and neuroendocrine cells is composed of the proteins synaptobrevin-2, syntaxin-1, and SNAP-25,
plays a key role in vesicle fusion. My laboratory has investigated vesicle fusion mechanisms in mast cells,
which release histamine and heparin; in neutrophils, which are part of the innate immune system and release
antimicrobial proteins; and in eosinophils, which release cytotoxic proteins to combat parasites. At present we
are mostly focused on the investigation of the exocytotic fusion mechanism in chromaffin cells, which we have
chosen for their specific advantages for experimental approaches and because their neuronal molecular fusion
machinery is better known than those of other cell types. Over the next 5 years, the function of the neuronal
SNARE proteins synaptobrevin2, syntaxin 1, SNAP25, and the accessory proteins synaptotagmin, complexin,
Munc18 and Munc13 in vesicle fusion and priming will be investigated as a model system to understand the
general mechanisms vesicle docking, priming and fusion. For these studies we will combine highly innovative
experimental and computational approaches developed in my laboratory to elucidate the nanomechanical
motions and interactions that lead to vesicle fusion and exocytotic release. Event Correlation Microscopy using
microfabricated Electrochemical Detector Arrays will be used to experimentally interrogate specific molecular
interactions and conformational changes related to fusion pore formation in cells and reconstituted systems.
The experimental research will be complemented by molecular dynamics simulations to interpret the
experimental data and to guide the experimental design. Various crystal structures of parts of the machinery
have been determined, which provide very high atomistic resolution, but they represent static structures. To
understand the functions of these protein complexes, their dynamic structural changes need to be elucidated.
The long term goal of my research is to achieve a true understanding of the nanomechanical mechanisms of
vesicle fusion docking, priming, fusion, and release. Our ultimately vision is to obtain realistic molecular movies
of the actions of fusion machine, providing deep insight into the mechanisms of vesicle priming and fusion pore
formation. This research will also advance our understanding of the related intracellular trafficking fusion
events as well as viral entry, which employ closely related fusion mechanisms.

10768563,"Alcohol misuse is responsible for ~88,000 deaths annually and exerts an annual cost of ~$250 billion in
the US. Binge drinking, which accounts for ~75% of these costs, is defined by the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism as consuming 4-5 drinks and/or achieving a blood alcohol level >80 mg/dL within a 2 hr
period (Sacks et al., 2010). Binge drinking is increasing in the US, is highly prevalent in both male and female
active military duty personnel and veterans, and is a strong predictor of an alcohol use disorder (AUD; Han et
al., 2017; Stahre et al., 2009; Gowin et al., 2017). More than 40% of US military veterans have a lifetime
history of alcohol use disorder (Fuerlein et al., 2016). Thus, alcohol exerts a large burden on health, social, and
economic problems, especially within the Department of Veterans Affairs.
 How individuals respond to their first experiences with alcohol are related to their risk for developing an
AUD, including frequent early adult binge drinking (King et al., 2011; McCarty et al., 2004). Identifying the brain
circuitry that underlies this dangerous pattern of drinking is an important first step in learning about vulnerability
factors for AUD. Our recent studies identified a key role for the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core in binge-like
drinking using DID (Drinking in the Dark; a paradigm which models binge-like drinking in mice) and
chemogenetics [i.e. DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs)]. Circuitry-based
studies in animals are powerfully relevant for humans with AUD. Treatment-resistant males with an AUD
diagnosis exhibit reduced drinking, craving, and rates of relapse with deep brain stimulation of the NAc (Pierce
and Vassoler, 2013). The NAc core receives projections from several regions and is important for many
behaviors. To further understand the circuitry of binge drinking, we will identify neural projections to the NAc
core that are engaged during DID in high drinking C57BL/6J mice. We will inject the retrograde marker,
rAAVretro-GFP, into the NAc core, expose mice to ethanol, saccharin, or water DID procedures, and then
quantify c-Fos immunoreactivity in GFP positive neurons. The proposed work will be the first to identify the
NAc core circuitry engaged during binge drinking using both in males and females. We hypothesize that
several NAc projecting brain regions will be engaged during ethanol DID, including the central and basolateral
amygdala, prelimbic cortex, and insula, ventral tegmental area, and ventral hippocampus.
 Our preliminary data support testing the role of an understudied projection from the central nucleus of
the amygdala (CeA) to the NAc core in binge drinking. Both regions are well known to be involved in alcohol
drinking, yet very little is known about the nature and role of this projection in drinking. We will manipulate CeA
inputs to the NAc (via chemogenetics and dual virus projection targeting) to determine whether this projection
modulates binge-like drinking. CeA neurons contain many neuropeptides and modulators; therefore, we will
identify the nature of these projections using immunohistochemistry. Based on the literature and the results of
our preliminary studies, we focus on the peptide neurotransmitter, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF). We will
administer corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) intra-accumbens to determine whether it alters binge-like
drinking. We will then test whether antagonism of CRF receptors can block the effects of stimulating CeA-
>NAc core projections (via chemogenetics) on DID. We hypothesize that chemogenetic stimulation of CeA-
>NAc projections will reduce drinking, intra-NAc core CRF will reduce binge-like drinking, and intra-NAc CRF
antagonists will block reductions in drinking seen with chemogenetic stimulation of CeA->NAc core projections.
 This proposal will use behavioral, pharmacological, and circuitry based approaches to better
understand the neural substrates of binge drinking. We will identify neuronal projections to NAc core important
for regulating binge-like drinking in the high drinking C57BL/6J mouse strain. We hypothesize that CeA
projections to the NAc core are important for regulating binge drinking and are engaged by binge drinking."

Nociception, the sensory mechanism that allows animals to sense and avoid potentially tissue-damaging
stimuli, is critical for survival across species. Nociceptors are specialized neurons that detect and respond to
potentially damaging factors through the expression of molecules that function to detect and signal the
presence of potential harm. The primary focus of the research in my laboratory has been the study of
nociception, however, we have also explored mechanisms underlying the sense of gentle touch, and most
recently, the sense of proprioception. We have found that each of these senses relies on specific classes of
non-ciliated multidendritic sensory neurons. The multidendritic neurons that are dedicated to a specific sensory
modality are morphologically distinct from one another, and they have diverse patterns of gene expression. We
seek to define how these distinct morphologies relate to function, and how ensembles of genes expressed
within the distinct morphological types of neurons control sensory pathways of somatosensation with a primary
focus on nociception. The overarching theme of our research program is understanding the molecular,
cellular, and circuit, mechanisms underlying nociception. The primary goal of our research program in the next
5 years will be to further characterize the function of the nociception genes that we have identified using
forward genetics. Our focus is on evolutionarily conserved genes that are not already understood to play
important roles in nociception. These studies provide the greatest impact in creating new knowledge. In
addition, we plan to begin to understand the neuronal network for nociception behavior."

Current AR inhibitors (enzalutamide and abiraterone) inhibit either the conversion of androgen to
dihydrotestosterone (DHT), block androgen binding to androgen receptor (AR), or AR signaling. Although
initially effective, these treatments eventually fail because of factors such as, AR-splice variants (AR-SVs)
and AR responding to stimuli other than androgen. An effective way to control the emergence and treatment
of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is to develop small molecules that either inhibit AR expression
or promote its degradation. If there is no AR, there would be no AR signaling, regardless of whether or how
much androgen or other stimuli of AR signaling are present in CRPC. Our preliminary studies demonstrated
that naturally occurring Urolithin A (UroA) inhibited the AR signaling and selectively suppressed the growth of
AR-positive (AR+: IC50 ~35 M) but not AR-negative (AR-: IC50 ~70 µM) CRPC in both in vitro and in vivo
models (50 mg/kg/body weight). As higher concentrations of UroA are required to suppress CRPC growth,
we aimed to design and develop potent UroA analogs that could selectively inhibit AR activation at lower
concentrations (nM), are orally bioavailable and suppress the growth of CRPC. The subsequent development
of a series of UroA analogs and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies led to the identification of two
novel lead compounds ASR-600 and ASR-603 (US Provisional 62/941588) which demonstrated better
efficacy (nM) than UroA (ASR-600: >40-fold and ASR-603: >12-fold) in inhibiting AR signaling in CRPC cell
lines. Molecular studies suggest these two ASRs inhibit both AR and AR-SVs expression via ubiquitination
and degradation within the cytosol. Molecular dynamic (MD) system simulation studies, biophysical analysis
based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and thermal shift assays showed that these small molecules
bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of AR and block the activation of both AR and AR-SV. At physiologically
achievable concentrations, ASR-600 abrogated AR+ and AR-SV (C4-2B and 22Rv1) tumor growth in
xenografts. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesized that ‘Rationally designed ASRs will effectively
inhibit and/or promote the degradation of both AR and AR-SV expression by directly targeting the AR-NTD
and inhibit the growth of CRPC. We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims. Aim
1. Investigate the mechanism of action of ASRs on AR+ CRPC cells. Aim 2. Determine in vivo signaling
mechanism of AR and AR-SVs expression and optimize the dose of ASRs. Aim 3. Determine the therapeutic
efficacy of the ASRs to inhibit CRPC growth in orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The
proposed studies will elucidate the mechanism of action of the ASRs and lead to a better understanding of
the chemotherapeutic properties of these compounds against CRPC."

 All life forms on Earth use the same set of natural genetic alphabets: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine
(G), thymine (T) (and uracil (U)) as the building blocks for storage and retrieval of their genetic information.
Recently, a major breakthrough was made in developing the first semi-synthetic organism that is able to store
and retrieve genetic information containing an unnatural base pair (UBP) in vivo. However, the molecular basis
of transcription processing of UBPs is poorly understood. An important and long-standing question remains
unanswered: How are these UBPs recognized by cellular transcription machinery? A lack of clear answers to
this important question represents a major knowledge gap in the field. The long-term goal of this project is to
tackle this important question. We hypothesize the transcription recognition of UBPs is governed by two layers
of specific interactions: specific interactions between the unnatural nucleic acid template and substrates as well
as their interplays with the active site of RNA polymerase. We will perform kinetic studies and compare the
transcription processing of three classes of representative UBPs by different RNA polymerases, including
single-subunit and multi-subunit RNA polymerases. We will determine the structural basis of transcription
recognition of UBPs and gain the mechanistic insights into how transcription machineries recognize unnatural
nucleotide substrate and catalyze the nucleotide addition reaction. We will utilize a combined approach that
includes X-ray crystallography, cryoEM, biophysics, biochemistry, computational biology, and nucleic acid
chemistry. The proposed research is significant and groundbreaking, because the novel knowledge and
structures obtained from this proposed research will have a transformative impact on the fields of transcription,
nucleic acid chemistry, as well as synthetic biology and vertically advance our understanding of the protein-
nucleic acid interactions and how unnatural nucleic acids and nucleotides are recognized by different RNA
polymerases. Ultimately, such knowledge will provide a framework for developing next generation of UBPs and
would produce novel therapeutic nucleic acids and proteins containing new functional groups."

De-implementation is recognized as a critical but understudied area within implementation science (IS).
Research is needed to determine the optimal methods and approaches for identifying, selecting, and tailoring
de-implementation strategies. De-implementation of routine cancer screening in older adults, such as
mammography screening for breast cancer, offers excellent opportunities for both advancing the science of de-
implementation and improving care delivery and health outcomes in older adults. While national guidelines do
not support routine mammography in older women and recommend consideration of morbidities, life
expectancy and patients’ informed preferences, ~56% of women ≥75 years report receiving mammography,
including 50% of women with life expectancy <10 years. Our preliminary research identified multi-level barriers
and facilitators to de-implementation of mammography overuse among older women at the organizational (e.g.
system alerts, patient reminder letters), provider/clinic (e.g., knowledge, clinic norms), and patient (e.g. habit,
knowledge) levels. Informed by the Knowledge-to-Action Model, we propose a study for de-implementation of
mammography overuse in older women (i.e., reducing the frequency or cessation of mammography) in older
women across a large healthcare system serving a racially/ethnically diverse population in New York City. In
Aim 1, we will identify a range of de-implementation strategies at the patient, provider, and organizational
levels for reducing mammography overuse in women ages ≥75 years. We will use a crowdsourcing method,
successfully applied in an emerging participatory IS approach (innovation tournament) to generate rapid data
collection from diverse stakeholders (80-100 patients/family members, 80-100 providers/administrators from
the community and multiple healthcare systems) on factors that influence de-implementation. Combining this
data with our rich qualitative preliminary data, and principles from Dual Process Theory, we will develop distinct
de-implementation strategies for refinement in Aim 2. In Aim 2, we will prioritize and tailor de-implementation
strategies at patient, provider/clinic, and organizational levels. We will recruit 12-15 experts to prioritize
strategies based on feasibility and acceptability, and propose key attributes (e.g., duration, frequency, content)
for each strategy, and employ discrete choice experiment to elicit patient (n=75-100) and provider (n=75-100)
preferences for modifiable attributes of each prioritized strategy. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the feasibility,
acceptability, and use of the tailored de-implementation strategies in a pilot cluster randomized trial (8 clinics).
Using a sequential mixed-methods design, we will assess use of strategies, de-adoption outcomes (e.g.
reduction of mammography overuse), and theoretical mechanisms of strategies at the patient, provider, and
organizational levels. Data will establish feasibility and provide preliminary data for effectiveness of strategies
to be tested in future Hybrid 2 trial, and lay the groundwork for advancing de-implementation frameworks and
methodological approaches for selecting de-implementation strategies to reduce the use of low-value care."

physician-scientist leadership. The Iowa StARR Scholars Program will identify residents early in their training
who have an interest in a mentored research experience during their residency. The Specific Aims of the
program include: Aim 1. To recruit and train outstanding Scholars from the University of Iowa internal
medicine and pediatric residency programs to increase the pipeline of physician-scientists. Aim 2. To create
an academic environment that stimulates and encourages promising trainees toward a career path as a
physician-scientist. Aim 3. To provide a highly focused and mentored research experience in the areas of
cardiovascular, lung, blood, and sleep diseases that promotes the Scholar’s success. Aim 4. To develop a
personalized mentoring and career development plan for each StARR Scholar that ensures mastery of
clinical skills and outstanding training and development as a scientist. Aim 5. To provide guidance and advice
for subsequent subspecialty fellowship training. We will focus on trainees who may not have otherwise
considered a career as a physician-scientist, and will provide them with the opportunities, mentoring, and skills
they need to succeed. This will be accomplished through a positive mentored research experience over 12-18
months in the context of their residency. Subsequent to this program, we anticipate that trainees will pursue
subspecialty training with a research focus and pursue research-oriented independent careers in academic
medical centers. We identified a team of outstanding, diverse, accomplished mentors in basic, translational, and
clinical research responsive to NHLBI priorities. The Iowa StARR Scholars Program will provide an environment
conducive to success. Key features include: 1) a mentored research experience that promotes the Scholars’
success and enthusiasm for a career as a physician-scientist. This includes immersion in a rich research
environment with interactions with successful physician-scientists; 2) an individual development plan designed
around the trainee’s experience and career goals and supervised by a mentoring committee; 3) regular
assessment of research competencies; 4) training in forms of communication including slide preparation,
planning of scientific talks, presentations at regional and national meetings, and manuscript writing and
publication; 5) a range of program activities including selected coursework, conferences and symposia, designed
to enrich the research experience and provide context for future success. At the completion of the program Iowa
StARR Scholars should have the clinical and research backgrounds needed to attain board eligibility in pediatrics
or internal medicine, succeed in subspecialty training, pursue support via the K38 program, and advance to
faculty positions aimed at independent research careers."

Continuing advances in nucleotide sequencing have resulted in the assembly of datasets containing large
numbers of species, genes, and genomic segments. Phylogenomic analyses of these data are essential to
progress in understanding evolutionary patterns across the tree of life, and are finding increasing numbers of
applications in practical analyses that require understanding of how patterns change over time. The sheer size
of phylogenomic datasets limits the practical utility of available methods due to excessive time and memory
requirements. We have developed many high impact methods and tools for comparative analysis of molecular
sequences, a tradition we propose to continue through this MIRA project by developing innovative methods that
address new challenges in phylogenomics. We will focus on pattern-based approaches of machine learning with
sparsity constraint (SL) applied to phylogenomics, as a complement to traditional model-based methods in
molecular evolution and phylogenetics. In the proposed SL in Phylogenomics (SLiP) framework, we will build
models that best explain the biological trait or evolutionary hypothesis of interest, with genomic loci, such as
genes, proteins, and genomic segments, serving as model parameters. Preliminary results from two example
applications establish the premise and promise of a general SLiP framework. In one, SLiP successfully detected
loci whose inclusion in a phylogenomic dataset overtakes a consistent and contrasting signal from hundreds of
other loci when inferring phylogenetic relationships. In the other example, SLiP revealed loci and biological
functional categories that harbor convergent sequence evolutionary patterns associated with the emergence of
the same trait in distinct evolutionary lineages. In all of these analyses, SLiP required only a small fraction of the
computational time and memory demanded by traditional methods, and it enabled better evolutionary contrasts
with fewer assumptions. Consequently, the successful development of SLiP will improve the feasibility, rigor,
and reproducibility of large-scale data analysis. It will also democratize big data analytics via shortened analysis
time and a relatively small memory footprint, and encourage the development of a new class of methods for
phylogenomic analysis. This framework will be accessed from a free library of SLiP functions, which will be
directly useable via command line and available in a graphical interface through integration with the MEGA
software."

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to pathology, but conversely, in limited measure they can also act as
second messengers, whereby they contribute to beneficial cellular signaling. Similar to calcium signaling or other
second messengers, the precise location, timing, and duration of ROS production likely determine divergent
signaling outputs. The mechanism underlying this functional dichotomy in redox biology is currently under
studied. An intriguing example of an apparent paradoxical impact of ROS occurs at complex I of the mitochondrial
electron transport chain. In the case of detrimental effects of oxidation, mitochondrial complex I ROS production
is mechanistically linked to oxidative damage in ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury, the pathology of stroke. In the
case of beneficial signaling, complex I ROS production is implicated in protective hypoxic signaling. Indeed, the
fact that some ROS production is a normal consequence of mitochondrial respiration supports the idea that ROS
contribute to normal physiology. Therefore, describing the nuances of complex I ROS production and its context-
dependent metabolic effects is necessary to fully determine the mechanisms of mitochondrial redox signaling,
both damaging and physiologic. To achieve that goal, precise experimental control of ROS production is
required. Until recently, controlling ROS production as an independent variable has been difficult. This renewal
leverages an optogenetic approach championed by our lab to overcome this barrier, and isolates ROS production
at complex I in the genetic model organism C. elegans. Previously, we have shown that ROS production at the
complex II microdomain differentially affects redox-sensitive outcomes in models of IR injury, depending on
whether the ROS were produced inside the mitochondrial matrix or in the intermembrane space. Using our
published novel CRISPR/Cas9 technology optimized for rapid use in C. elegans, we will target well-characterized
light-activated ROS generating proteins (RGPs) to endogenous complex I in order to precisely control the
location, timing, and duration of complex I ROS production with light. This will provide a model of either complex
I redox signaling, or oxidative damage, depending on the light-titration of RGP activation, where more light will
produce more ROS. Combined with tissue-specific expression, we will determine the effects of each of these
spatiotemporal parameters on normal mitochondrial function, neuronal function, and stress-resistance signaling
programs in response to simulated IR injury. We will focus on the neuronal outcomes of complex I ROS
production, both in response to strong literature support for the importance of neurons in mediating hypoxic
stress signaling, and to determine neuronal circuits that could be targeted for translation to mammalian models
of stroke. This approach is perfectly suited to the powerful C. elegans genetic system. We expect that completion
of our aims will provide novel, fundamental insights with clear answers to questions about how the mitochondrial
complex I ROS microdomain controls diverse outcomes in both disease and physiology."

Cells in a variety of contexts migrate towards soluble chemical cues in a process known as chemotaxis.
Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanistic underpinnings of chemotaxis remain incompletely
understood. Spatial gradients of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and other chemoattractants direct
the movements of mesenchymal cells in tissues to coordinate and accelerate physiologically important
processes such as wound healing, and mesenchymal chemotaxis has been implicated in pathological
conditions such as cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases. Despite the central role that fibroblasts and other
mesenchymal cells play in wound healing and other disease processes such as metastatic cancer and
fibrosis, a rigorous understanding of mechanisms governing the directed migration of mesenchymal cells
is only recently emerging. To advance further, a quantitative, integrative approach is required.
Specifically, it is necessary to elucidate how the central regulatory pathways network with others and how
they are coordinated with respect to subcellular location and time to affect cell behavior. In the context of
directed mesenchymal cell migration, another layer of complexity is the variation of gradient conditions
(midpoint concentration/surface density and steepness). Enabled by new engineering advances, we are
poised to tackle these new questions related to chemotaxis and haptotaxis and to their combinatorial
influence in multi-cue settings. Our Specific Aims are as follows:
Aim 1: Decoding the dynamics of multiple signaling axes that shape mesenchymal chemotaxis.
We will test the hypothesis that protrusion dynamics are governed by the metastable push/pull of Arp2/3
complex and NMII activities, which are insufficiently biased by a chemotactic gradient. With stable
polarization of active PKC in the most-up-gradient protrusion, the inactivation of NMII there provides a
‘port in the storm’ for pro-Arp2/3 signaling to mediate more productive protrusion.
Aim 2: Probing the dynamics of haptotactic sensing and signal amplification. We hypothesize that
differential integrin engagement on ECM gradients drives significant cell migration bias through feedback
amplification of the pro-Arp2/3 signaling axis. If so, it would imply that haptotactic gradients are able to
bias pro-Arp2/3 signaling in mesenchymal cells to an extent that chemotactic gradients cannot.
Aim 3: Defining gradient synergy and prioritization in multi-cue scenarios. Despite the relevance
for guidance of mesenchymal cells in vivo, it is completely unknown how cells respond to co-presentation
of the two gradient types in a controlled setting. Considering how chemotaxis and haptotaxis affect
dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in fibroblasts, we hypothesize that the two gradients
synergize when presented in a parallel orientation. By presenting the gradients in an antiparallel or
orthogonal orientation, we will determine how cells prioritize the two types of cues."

Rejection remains a major hurdle to long lasting transplant survival and we aspire to uncover the
fundamental mechanisms that hinder stable allograft survival. In the last funding period, we studied the
mechanisms of Treg dysfunctions and identified BATF and BATF3 as potent repressors of Foxp3,
suppressing Foxp3 expression and Treg induction. These studies also led to the discovery of the DHX15
helicase as a critical regulator of Foxp3+Tregs, as conditional deletion of Dhx15 in Tregs resulted in a
profound depletion of Tregs in the periphery and lethal autoimmune diseases. In essence, DHX15 is an
RNA helicase (an RNA binding motor protein) and traditionally thought to be involved in RNA processing. Its
roles in the control of Tregs are unexpected and clearly reveal novel previously unknown aspects of Tregs
that are different from currently known mechanisms, and uncovering those mechanisms is the central goal
of this proposal.
Our working hypothesis is that DHX15 controls Treg identity and/or survival at peripheral sites and that its
deficiency results in either their reversion to Teff or die of apoptosis. We surmise that DHX15 may also
control Tregs at the graft site, where they must overcome the inflammatory milieu to exert suppressive
functions. We proposed 3 Aims to test this hypothesis in this application: the first Aim is to test whether
DHX15 controls Treg identity by acting as an RNA splicing factor, processing mRNAs that encode the
Foxp3 or Foxp3 controlled signature molecules in Tregs, the second Aim is to address whether DHX15
controls Tregs survival by regulating the IL-2 signaling complex, such that Tregs die of apoptosis in its
absence, and the third Aim is to examine whether DHX15 is especially important for Tregs at graft sites
where they are needed the most in promoting transplant tolerance. Overall, DHX15 is the first RNA helicase
identified thus far that controls Tregs, and the genetically modified models as well as cutting-edge
approaches we have developed put us in a unique position in dissecting mechanistically how the DHX15
helicase acts in regulating Tregs, an area of considerable importance in both basic Treg biology and Treg-
based therapies."
10928079,"Disruptions in the complex balance between inflammatory and homeostatic signaling in the intestinal mucosa
can result in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). From this perspective, there is significant
interest in identifying endogenous homeostatic pathways in the intestinal mucosa. Targeted activation of these
mucosal pathways may restore homeostasis and at the same time avoid the risks of systemic
immunosuppression which is frequently utilized for control of IBD. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and its metabolic
by-product carbon monoxide are activated in the setting of oxidative stress. Stimulation of this pathway has
been demonstrated to be protective in several murine models of IBD. Activation of the HO-1 pathway in
macrophages has been shown to augment bacterial killing and negatively regulate proinflammatory cytokine
expression in the intestinal mucosa. We have also identified an anti-inflammatory role for intestinal epithelial
HO-1. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is a transcription factor that is activated in the setting of hypoxic stress.
Stabilization of epithelial HIF is protective against intestinal inflammation. It is a transcriptional activator of HO-
1 but a relationship between the protective impact of HIF and HO-1 in chronic intestinal inflammation has not
previously been established, nor has the regulatory relationship between the two been examined in intestinal
epithelial cells or macrophages. The proposed project will test the hypothesis that stabilization of HIF in
intestinal epithelial cells and MΦ is protective against intestinal inflammation through induction of HO-1. Based
on our preliminary data, this is pursued with the following objectives: 1. Define the contribution of HO-1 to the
protective impact of epithelial HIF in mucosal inflammation. 2. Determine if myeloid HIF is protective against
intestinal inflammation through HO-1. 3. Test the efficacy of selective induction of HIF/HO-1 for amelioration of
chronic intestinal inflammation. This proposed project is part of a plan to support the Candidate's career
development into an independently funded, VA-based, physician-scientist through an appropriately structured
combination of research, training and mentoring activities. The Candidate is a gastroenterologist with a focus
on IBD and homeostatic pathways of the mucosal immune system. With the support of this award, a nationally
recognized research institution, and experienced mentors, this project will advance expertise in integrated
mucosal biology and proficiency in therapeutic modulation of mucosal anti-inflammatory pathways for
treatment of IBD."
10997300,"Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a major health priority within the VA. More than 24% of Veterans have T2D, twice
the national average. There is an increasing population of female veterans in the VA in the premenopausal age
range. Premenopausal women with T2D have poorer health-related outcomes compared with age-matched
men with T2D. The mechanisms for this sex difference in T2D are unknown. Aerobic power predicts the
incidence of the poor health-related outcomes associated with T2D. T2D negatively impacts aerobic power to a
greater degree in premenopausal women with T2D compared with men with T2D. Aerobic power is partially
dependent on skeletal muscle bioenergetics. This proposal is designed to address a clinically significant
knowledge gap related to women with T2D, to identify potential targets for clinical therapies to improve the
health of women with T2D, and to provide training in several specific methods that will prepare me for a
successful transition to independence.
Aerobic power is partially dependent on skeletal muscle bioenergetics: signaling associated with and measures
of cellular energy balance and mitochondrial biogenesis/function. Estrogen (E2) signaling is reported to be
supportive of skeletal muscle bioenergetics, however, my surprising preclinical data suggest that the
physiological context in which estrogen signaling is studied is important. My pilot data reveal an unexpected
adverse interaction of E2 and diabetes on the regulators of skeletal muscle bioenergetics. My working
hypothesis is that diabetes suppresses E2-mediated support of bioenergetics in skeletal muscle of
reproductive aged female rats. I will address this hypothesis with two specific aims:
Aim 1: To test the impact of the diabetic environment on skeletal muscle E2 signaling and mitochondrial
biogenesis in vitro. This aim will determine impact of diabetes on E2-mediated support of signaling associated
with and measures of cellular energy balance and mitochondrial biogenesis. Through intricate signaling studies
data will be generated to identify the diabetes-associated mechanism(s) that could be targeted to restore
mitochondrial bioenergetics in women with T2D.
Aim 2: To understand whether the disruption of E2 support of skeletal muscle bioenergetics in vivo by diabetes
impairs exercise capacity. This aim will determine the bioenergetic consequences of the diabetes-associated
disruption of E2 support of skeletal muscle through measures of substrate utilization, mitochondrial function,
and aerobic exercise capacity.
This proposal addresses the clinically relevant knowledge gap related to decreased functional status of
premenopausal women with T2D and could identify potential targets for clinical therapies to improve the health
of women with T2D. Through training with my mentors, coursework, and the successful completion of the
project specific aims, I will further develop my knowledge base and skillset in primary cell culture, cellular
signal transduction, and manipulation of E2 and derive new data that will set me on the path to achieve my
overall goal of becoming a successful, independent VA scientist."
10781888,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Situational cues that signal reward availability can exert a powerful invigorating influence over reward-seeking
behavior. However, this impulse to seek out reward is not always adaptive. To conserve time and effort, cue-
motivated reward seeking is regulated by homeostatic and cognitive control processes. There is growing
evidence that these processes become dysregulated in a range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including
substance use disorder, compulsive overeating, and depression, leading to a drop in healthy reward-seeking
activity (e.g., apathy and anhedonia) and/or the development of maladaptive reward seeking (e.g., intense drug
and food cravings). Despite their importance to both health and disease, much remains unknown of the neural
circuits that regulate adaptive cue-motivated behavior. This project aims to fill this critical gap in knowledge.
Based on the recent studies and our strong preliminary findings, we hypothesize that dopamine release is
transformed into a motivational message at nucleus accumbens (NAc) terminals by cholinergic activity, and that
inputs from the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) exert opposing regulatory
influences over this process to ensure adaptive reward seeking. We will rigorously test this using a multifaceted
approach that combines projection- and cell type-specific activity monitoring, neurochemical recordings,
projection- and cell type-specific chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations, and a translationally relevant
Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer assay of cue-motivated behavior. Aim 1 will investigate how cholinergic
modulation of NAc dopamine release contributes to homeostatic and cognitive control over cue-motivated reward
seeking. We will specifically determine whether cue-elicited NAc dopamine encodes changes in need state and
reward probability, how this relates to midbrain dopamine neuron activity, and whether dopamine’s motivational
message is locally shaped by cholinergic interneurons acting at β2-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
on dopamine terminals. Aim 2 will investigate if projections from PVT to NAc facilitate cue-motivated behavior in
line with current needs, and whether it does so by regulating NAc cholinergic and/or dopaminergic activity. Aim
3 will determine if ACC projections to NAc adaptively suppress active reward-seeking behavior when cues signal
that an alternative response would be advantageous, and whether this depends on NAc acetylcholine and/or
dopamine. Our findings will lead to major advances in knowledge of the specific neural circuits and
neurochemical mechanisms responsible for regulating cue-motivated behavior, and will guide future research
on how dysfunction in these mechanisms contributes to maladaptive reward seeking in addiction and related
disease states."

Headquartered in the city of Detroit, the KCI catchment area covers 46 of Michigan’s 83 counties, an area that
is home to 6.7 million residents. KCI’s mission is to lead in transformative cancer care, research and education
through courage, commitment and compassion. Dr. Hayley Thompson (PSDR), Associate Center Director for
Community Outreach and Engagement, leads KCI’s efforts in support of this mission. Under her leadership, KCI
has expanded its Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) efforts through the Office of Cancer Health
Equity and Community Engagement (OCHECE). OCHECE’s activities are guided by a cancer surveillance
strategy that captures data across four distinct catchment area regions that are diverse across race, ethnicity,
and rurality. Activities are further guided by a participatory research approach in which community stakeholders
are actively engaged in research prioritization, implementation, and dissemination. In 2016, OCHECE worked
with range of community partners to establish Michigan Cancer HealthLink, a network of Cancer Action Councils
(CACs) organized as neighborhood-based and population-driven groups of cancer survivors, caregivers, and
advocates who have been historically excluded from meaningful research collaborations. The CAC infrastructure
has provided a mechanism for community stakeholders to dialogue with researchers and inform the public
relevance of KCI research across the Cancer Center’s four research Programs (Tumor Biology and
Microenvironment, Molecular Imaging, Molecular Therapeutics, and Populations Studies and Disparities
Research). These strategies of surveillance and engagement ensure that KCI research and outreach are
aligned with the cancer burden in the catchment area."
10757675,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Doxorubicin is routinely prescribed in treatment of various cancers because of its extremely high efficacy.
However, its use is severely limited because of its potential to cause irreversible cardiotoxicity. Since cessation
of therapy is not viable in cancer patients, there is a need to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying
cardiotoxicity to accurately identify risk factors as well as therapeutic targets for effective adjuncts. The primary
mechanism by which doxorubicin exerts its cardiotoxic effects is due to preferential accumulation of excess iron
in cardiac mitochondria, which generates cytotoxic free radicals, and disruption of cellular and subcellular iron
utilization. Thus, chelating excess mitochondrial iron can prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction.
Indeed, the only drug approved to treat doxorubicin cardiomyopathy, dexrazoxane, has demonstrated
mitochondrial chelation potential. However, dexrazoxane alters topoisomerases, the enzymes responsible for
DNA replication and doxorubicin’s pharmacological target, which thereby impairs doxorubicin’s anticancer
activity. In addition, dexrazoxane has potential to induce fatal myelosuppression and acute leukemias, which
consequently limit its clinical utility. Cancer survivors who subsequently develop cardiomyopathies have the
worst survivals among all cardiomyopathies, and timely intervention results in a superior clinical outcome in those
survivors treated with cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Thus, there is a major unmet need for mitochondria-specific
iron chelators that do not impede doxorubicin’s antitumor activity. Earlier we have demonstrated that hinokitiol,
a small molecule with high iron binding affinity and cell permeability, corrects abnormal iron buildup across the
membrane caused by genetic deficiency in mitochondrial iron transporters. These findings prompted us to
question if hinokitiol could rescue doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial accumulation of iron. Our pilot study has
indicated a feasibility that hinokitiol corrects mitochondrial iron overload and improves survival in cardiac cells
treated with doxorubicin with no influence on tumor-killing effect of doxorubicin. Thus, we hypothesize that
hinokitiol mobilizes excess iron from the cardiac mitochondria and prevents oxidative damage, thereby reversing
doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, while preserving doxorubicin’s anticancer activity. The specific aims are
to determine: i) mitochondrial iron export after hinokitiol administration, ii) the cardioprotective effect of hinokitiol
on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, and iii) the effect of hinokitiol on the antineoplastic efficacy of doxorubicin
using tumor-bearing mice. Our studies will provide a new therapeutic strategy to reverse abnormal accumulation
of mitochondrial iron and correct doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity without compromising its antineoplastic
effects. If successful, this drug can be safely co-administered with doxorubicin as a rescue factor to improve the
therapeutic index of doxorubicin along with better clinical outcome.

10757009,"Public radiation exposure due to large-scale radiation incidents is a rising global concern. Gastrointestinal
Acute Radiation Syndrome (GI-ARS) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, FDA-
approved therapeutics for GI-ARS are unavailable. Therefore, outlining the mechanisms of radiation injury to
develop targeted medical countermeasures (MCMs) is a high priority. The gut microbiome is highly
susceptible to ionizing radiation, and an altered microbiome is a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis
of GI-ARS. The gap in this field is that the precise mechanisms by which radiation causes dysbiosis of gut
microbiota and its impact on radiation injury are poorly defined. The long-term goal of our research is to
identify the radiation-sensitive microbiota in the gut and develop gut microbiome-targeted MCMs to mitigate
radiation injury. Our preliminary studies have identified that: 1) Lactobacillus casei and plantarum mitigate
radiation-induced epithelial tight junction (TJ) disruption and barrier dysfunction by distinct cellular
mechanisms. 2) Depletion of Paneth cell α-defensins plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of radiation-
induced microbiota dysbiosis. 3) When administered in diet 24 hours after irradiation, L. casei and L. plantarum
mitigate radiation-induced α-defensin depletion, microbiota dysbiosis, gut barrier dysfunction, endotoxemia,
and systemic inflammation. These findings form the scientific premise and support the central hypothesis that
“L. casei and L. plantarum synergistically mitigate GI-ARS by reversing dysbiosis of gut microbiota and
epithelial barrier dysfunction, leading to attenuation of endotoxemia and systemic inflammation.” We
will test this hypothesis by determining that 1) L. plantarum mitigates radiation-induced epithelial TJ disruption
by EGFR-mediated inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-2 (JNK2)/c-Src/protein tyrosine phosphorylation, 2) L.
casei mitigates radiation-induced remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and mucosal barrier dysfunction in the
intestinal epithelium by a PKC-dependent mechanism, 3) L. casei and L. plantarum synergistically mitigate
radiation-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction, 4) Radiation downregulates intestinal Paneth cell α-defensins
by HDAC3-mediated histone deacetylation, 5) HDAC3 and α-defensin downregulation play crucial roles in
radiation-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota, 6) L. casei and L. plantarum, and their 3KDF fractions mitigate
radiation-induced HDAC3 expression, α-defensin depletion, and gut microbiota dysbiosis, 7) Identifying the
lowest effective doses of L. casei, L. plantarum, and 3KDF fractions for mitigating GI-ARS, 8) Determining the
ideal time window for the effectiveness of L. casei, L. plantarum, and 3KDF fractions, and 9) Determining the
most effective doses of L. casei and L. plantarum, and the ideal time window for increasing the survival rate
after lethal dose irradiation. Completing this project will establish a significant causative relation of intestinal
Lactobacillus depletion with radiation injury. Furthermore, these studies will validate Lactobacillus-based
probiotic therapy as a novel microbiome-targeted MCM for GI-ARS under the Animal-Rule guidance."
10783778,"Project Summary/Abstract
This R01 application responds to the National Institutes of Health Notice of Special Interest in Research on the
Health of Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) Populations (NOT-MD-19-001). Sexual minority youth (SMY)
face a number of mental health disparities, including high rates of depression and suicidality. Sexual minority
identity development includes several key milestones (e.g., becoming aware of non-heterosexual attractions,
questioning one’s sexual orientation, self-identifying as a sexual minority, and coming out to others) that
typically occur during adolescence. Challenging experiences that occur during the sexual identity development
process related to social stigma and stress likely contribute to mental health problems for this population;
however, this area has been understudied and is poorly understood. To address critical gaps and limitations in
this area, this project aims to: (1) Identify common patterns and heterogeneity in sexual identity development
milestones among contemporary SMY; (2) Determine the extent to which sexual identity development relates to
mental health problems (i.e., depression and suicidality) among SMY; and (3) Identify coping strategies and
resources used by SMY to navigate stressful milestone experiences. To accomplish these aims, we will recruit
a diverse sample of 315 SMY who will complete a one-time interview that will include life history calendars,
which is an innovative method used to collect retrospective life-course data. Life history calendars will capture
mixed-methods data about the sexual minority identity development process and mental health problems during
adolescence. Analyses will include descriptive statistics, latent profile analysis, regression modeling,
qualitative content analysis, and data visualization techniques. This project will result in (1) a rich and nuanced
understanding of a complex and dynamic developmental process—sexual identity development among
contemporary SMY, (2) identification of which milestones involve distressing experiences for SMY, (3)
understanding why certain milestones are distressing and how these events may be associated with depression
and suicidality, and (4) a framework of coping strategies and resources used by SMY to cope with stress during
identity development."
10794322,"Metabolism can affect the aging process through many mechanisms. The effects of calorie levels and the
sensation of nutrient sources are powerful regulators. Other metabolic pathways may affect aging by acting as
signaling or transcriptional regulators. The 1 carbon cycle has multiple links to aging, particularly through the
production of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM is critical for epigenetic modification,
which can affect many cellular processes, including aging. SAM is also important for the production of a
phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), which is a major membrane component. We propose to study how one
1CC metabolite, PC, impacts aging though it’s role in a membrane stress pathway. Using a long-lived C.
elegans model (sams-1) and human cell-based assays, we found that lowering PC induces a stress response in
the Golgi, limiting the GTPase ARF-1.2/ARF1, which is a critical regulator of Golgi function. One effect of this
stress response is the maturation of a membrane-intrinsic transcription factor, SBP-1/SREBP-1, to restore lipid
homeostasis. We also found that a compensatory program is upregulated that produces an alternative ARF, arf-
1.1. to support Golgi function. We have identified at least one transcription factor, LET-607, which is also
intrinsic to the membrane, as a regulator of this process. Thus, the Golgi stress response has multiple
transcriptional outputs that play specific roles in correcting organelle misfunction. Finally, Golgi stress may be
important in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting our studies could have a broad impact outside the
aging field.
Our proposal is based on data from multiple genetic screens, metabolomic studies, and other unbiased
approaches. Next, our plan is to use a combination of cell biology, genetics and biochemistry several key
questions. First, we will explore the basic cell biology of the Golgi stress response, which is not well
understood. Second, we will determine how the LET-607 transcription factor is regulated during the stress
response. These experiments will be complemented by our investigation on the molecular and biochemical basis
explaining how ARF-1.1 can function when membrane conditions limit ARF-1.2. Finally, we have found that
ARF-1.2 selectively disappears from the intestine in aging C. elegans. Because regulation of yolk secretion has
important connections to aging, it is important to understand what regulates this loss of ARF-1.2 and how it
might impact aging in sams-1 animals. Metabolites such as SAM and PC may have distinct roles in aging and
stress in a variety of contexts, as these molecules can contribute to a variety of different processes. By
delineating molecular mechanisms downstream of SAM and PC that affect membrane properties, we will
uncover how specific aspects of 1 carbon and lipid metabolism drive changes in aging and stress."
10788447,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objective of this application is to generate a thoroughly-validated panel of genetically diverse mouse
embryonic stem cells (mESC) that will enable widespread adoption of cellular systems genetics. Phenotypic
variation, manifesting as heterogeneity in cell state, represents a significant challenge for realizing the full
promise of individualized, cell-based therapies, regenerative medicine. But phenotypic variation in genetically
diverse stem cells also presents an opportunity for the advancement of large scale, cellular screens of gene by
environment interactions (e.g. pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics). A variety of approaches are beginning to
identify the networks that drive cell state transitions, but these efforts have largely focused on bulk assays,
which do not provide sufficient resolution of cell state heterogeneity, and mask the contribution of underlying
genetic variation on rare cell types. Moreover, genetic studies using human pluripotent stem cells are largely
limited to testing common variants due to low allele frequencies and imbalanced population structure requiring
prohibitively large samples and impeding identification of core regulatory networks with high power and
resolution. Therefore, we currently lack a thorough understanding of the genes and mechanisms that underlie
phenotypic variation in pluripotent stem cells. The Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population at The Jackson
Laboratory is genetically defined, diverse, and presents a singular, cost-effective opportunity to systematically
investigate heterogeneity in mammalian pluripotency. Our pilot studies using DO mESCs establish the
feasibility of identifying regulatory loci at high power and resolution, as well as networks conserved in mice and
humans that regulate cell state transitions. In Aim 1, we will create a reference mapping panel of 300 DO
mESC lines that will serve as a gold standard resource for cellular systems genetics. This panel will be fully
credentialed and banked for broad availability through The Jackson Laboratory / Mutant Mouse Resource and
Research Centers (MMRRC). In Aim 2, we will determine at the single cell level the transcriptional networks
that regulate cell state transitions in vitro through the early stages of differentiation to mesoderm in a
representative subset of 144 lines. In Aim 3, we will map quantitative trait loci (QTL) that underlie variation in
cell state-specific gene expression and in the distribution of cell states in a population. In addition, we will build
and test models based on polygenic scores that can predict differentiation propensity from genotype. Finally, a
web-based searchable database of expression phenotypes and interactive tools for visualization of cell
composition and eQTL will be made publicly available to support community queries and hypothesis
generation. In sum, we will produce a resource of cell lines and gene expression data for the research
community that will spur new discoveries in regenerative medicine, pharmacogenomics, and toxicogenomics."
10896120,"Development of a SYF2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment for ALS and FTD
Project Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are complex diseases that result from many
diverse genetic etiologies. Although therapeutic strategies that target specific causal mutations (e.g. C9ORF72 antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs)) may prove effective against individual forms of ALS or FTD, these approaches cannot address
the vast majority of cases that have unknown genetic etiology. Moreover, given the large number of different genes that
likely contribute to ALS and FTD and the fact that each genetic form is relatively rare, this strategy may be difficult to
implement for all cases. Thus, there is a pressing need for new therapeutic strategies that rescue multiple forms of ALS
and FTD, particularly those with unknown genetic etiologies.
 A hallmark pathological feature of ALS and FTD is the depletion of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) from the
nucleus of neurons in the brain and spinal cord to the cytoplasm where it aggregates into insoluble inclusion bodies in
>95% of ALS cases and ~45% of FTD cases post mortem. While studies suggest that these neuronal TDP-43 aggregates
drive neurodegeneration58, reduction in TDP-43 from the nucleus also alters the splicing or expression levels of more than
1,500 RNAs9, including disease hallmarks such as STMN2. Thus, both the loss of TDP-43 from the nucleus and its
aggregation in the cytoplasm contribute to neurodegeneration, and it is critical to develop treatments that address both
aspects of this challenging pathology.
 We found that suppressing the gene encoding the spliceosome-associated factor SYF2 alleviates TDP-43 aggregation
and mislocalization, improves TDP-43 activity, and rescues C9ORF72 and sporadic ALS survival. Moreover, Syf2
suppression ameliorates neurodegeneration, neuromuscular junction loss, and motor dysfunction in TDP-43 mice. Mice
with one loss-of-function copy of Syf2 are healthy and humans carrying a loss-of-function SYF2 allele are not affected by
pediatric diseases or known to be affected by disease in adulthood. Thus, suppression of spliceosome-associated factors
such as SYF2 is a promising and broadly-effective genetic target for ALS and FTD.
 Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are an attractive approach for genetic targets in the central nervous system (CNS)
like SYF2 because they can be injected directly into the spinal cord, achieve sustained target engagement throughout the
CNS, and are less likely to cause peripheral toxicity. Leveraging our proprietary ASO design software, we assessed all
possible SYF2 ASO sequences in silico and prioritized several hundred leads predicted to have enhanced stability and
manufacturability, and reduced immunogenicity and off-target effects. The objective of this Direct to Phase 2 project is to
identify a bona fide development candidate SYF2 ASO from among these leads for advancement in investigational new
drug (IND)-enabling toxicity studies. The broad aims of the project are to establish the therapeutic index of Syf2
suppression in TDP-43 mice, assess SYF2 leads for potency, efficacy and tolerability in a large panel of ALS
patient-derived neurons and a bacterial artificial chromosome human SYF2 transgenic mouse, and lastly to assess the leads
in an exploratory toxicity study in rodents."

The overall goal of this core is to expand and provide centralized analysis of human memory B cells (Bmem)
for the research program, to enhance our understanding of humoral responses to influenza vaccination and
infection. Specifically, Core D will perform single-cell Nojima cultures to characterize BCR repertoire of human
Bmem cells. Nojima culture, developed by members of Core D, is a feeder cell-dependent, B-cell expansion /
antibody cloning system to characterize the B-cell repertoire at a single-cell level. Unique features of Nojima
cultures include unbiased expansion of single B cells, high cloning efficiency, and ease of sample handling.
Combining Nojima cultures with multiplexed antigen-binding assays, we can rapidly determine large numbers
of BCR phenotypes (specificity, avidity, cross-reactivity) and genotypes (V(D)J gene sequences) for mouse,
human, and non-human primate B cells. Core D activities include 1) isolation of single human Bmem cells from
different age groups, 2) generation of clonal IgG antibodies through Nojima cultures, 3) determination of
specificity and avidity, and 4) V(D)J gene sequences of the clonal IgG antibodies. Core D will directly interact
with all projects and other scientific cores through communications, discussions, and data sharing. The
inclusion of this Bmem Analysis Core will provide robust, uniform and comprehensive analysis of the human
Bmem repertoire, critical for achieving the overall goals of the Program Project.

While our PO1 aims at positioning anti-glycan immunotherapy as a new approach to treat severe bacterial
diseases, we will contribute some essential basic studies to it by deconstructing the immune recognition of
glycans by T and B cells. This work is made possible by the chemistry groups (Projects 1, 2, and 3) who will
provide unique immunogens and reagents and will fit next to the bacteriology and structural biology components
of the consortium to perform in vivo studies and structure determinations. The integration of the immunology
results within this framework will inform the chemists on how to modify glycan epitopes and their linkages to
optimize immune recognition and in vivo effector functions. Our effort will be divided between three specific aims:
Aim 1: Establish the molecular basis of glycan recognition by T cells.
We have shown that cognate recognition of the glycopeptide (GP) by T cells occurred. We will determine its
importance in driving high affinity anti-glycan antibodies and study the repertoire diversity of these cells. The
biophysical and structural basis of MHC-GP T cell recognition will be examined as well. We hypothesize that
cognate glycan recognition by T cells is important for driving high affinity B cell maturation.
Aim 2: Establish the molecular basis of glycan recognition by B cells.
We will examine the kinetics of germinal center formation upon immunization and follow the maturation of anti-
glycan B cells towards high affinity by isolating single B cells with antigen specific reagents and sequencing their
receptors. Biophysical studies after recombinant expression of antibodies, paired with the structural effort of Core
3 should allow to decipher the basic rules of glycan antibody recognition. Here, recognition of capsular antigens
will be compared to the recognition of teichoic acids, peptidoglycans and O-linked saccharides.
Aim 3: Effectiveness of the vaccinal immune response to glycan in mice. As we evaluate in standard
models the protection capacity of anti-glycan antibodies, we will compare vaccine to passive immunotherapy.
The possibility to optimize this latter intervention will be explored with recombinant antibodies aimed at avoiding
Staphylococcus aureus ability to foil the B cell response.
While we have shown that we could produce monoclonal antibodies of high affinity against bacterial glycans
protective in challenges models, here, we should provide fundamental mechanistic insights into the recognition
of glycans by B and T cells. Our team will challenge this knowledge in the context of one of the most threatening
bacterial infections of man: Staphylococcus aureus."
10799544,"The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of a newly discovered diverse
set of adaptive mechanisms that maintain the integrity of the genome during anaphase and telophase.
Eukaryotic cells have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to maintain genomic integrity. In response to insults
to the genome, checkpoints delay progression through the cell cycle, providing time for either repair of the
damaged DNA or induction of apoptosis to eliminate the compromised cell. The majority of previous studies have
focused on checkpoint mechanisms operating during interphase and metaphase. In spite of these safeguards,
cells occasionally enter and progress through metaphase with damaged DNA, lagging chromatin, or a
chromosome which has failed to secure a stable association with a kinetochore microtubule. Focusing on these
errors led to the discovery of the abscission checkpoint, which delays the final stages of cytokinesis, providing
time to clear chromatin from the path of the cytokinesis furrow. This discovery changed the prevailing view that,
once the spindle-assembly checkpoint is satisfied, anaphase and telophase proceed rapidly without error
correction mechanisms. Clearly, this is not the case and a number of labs, included ours, investigate the
compensatory mechanisms that operate during anaphase to maintain genomic integrity. Here, we propose that
in addition to the abscission checkpoint, the eukaryotic cell maintains a sophisticated and diverse set of
mechanisms that function during the anaphase-telophase transition to ensure that chromosome fragments
lacking a kinetochore (acentrics) are successfully transmitted and incorporated into daughter nuclei. This
conclusion is based on our finding that in Drosophila, acentric chromosome fragments successfully congress,
undergo delayed but proper sister separation, and efficiently segregate to opposing poles and incorporate into
daughter nuclei. This was surprising as all of these chromosome dynamics were thought to be largely driven by
kinetochore-microtubule associations. Our studies revealed a number of previously undescribed mechanisms
and cellular adaptations such as DNA tethers, cell and spindle elongation, and channels in the nuclear envelope.
We view these as revealing novel mechanisms operating during anaphase/telophase to maintain genomic
integrity. In addition, observing the behavior of acentric chromosome fragments reveals forces acting on
chromosomes that are independent of the kinetochore-microtubule attachments. We view these as key
mechanisms that maintain genomic fidelity when cells exit metaphase with damaged chromosomes. Given that
transmission of acentric chromosomes and DNA bridges have been observed across the phyla, many of these
mechanisms are likely conserved. The studies described here rely on a combination of genetic, fluorescent and
electron microscope studies as well as on high throughput cell-based screens to determine the molecular basis
of these adaptive mechanisms functioning at the final stages of the eukaryotic cell cycle."

10755654,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There are large and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in preterm birth and low birth weight. Individual-level
risk factors do not fully explain the observed disparities. There is increasing evidence for the role of area-level
racial bias in explaining these disparities, but we currently lack both the measures, methods, and findings to
empirically evaluate its influence. The proposed research will advance the research in all 3 areas. We will be
using online and social media data and machine learning models to create two measures of area-level racial
bias and implement a robust research design to determine whether area-level racial bias impacts birth
outcomes. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, health disparities,
machine learning, social media data, biostatistics, and community engaged research—is uniquely suited to
implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are to 1) track and detect changes in area-level racial bias and
identify local and national race-related events during these time points, 2) determine the impact of changes in
area-level racial bias on changes in adverse birth outcomes, and 3) identify protective factors for adverse birth
outcomes. Because our data is collected repeatedly and finely across the United States, we can explicitly
account for temporal trends and place effects. The proposed study uses new data to capture trends in racial
bias with sophisticated machine learning models, and represents a critical advancement in the investigation of
racial disparities in birth outcomes."
10749065,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and its reciprocal connection with medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) control
important aspects of executive functioning and social behavior. Dysfunction of this neural circuit can cause
developmental brain disorders and neuropsychiatric conditions. Understanding prefrontal thalamocortical
(MD→mPFC) circuit function has been hampered by a lack of understanding of MD projection neuron types
and how they integrate and process synaptic information. The central hypothesis is that differences in intrinsic
properties and connectivity between the two major populations of neurons that provide ascending input to the
mPFC causes them to extract and transmit different information to the mPFC. Thus, these two populations
have different roles in behavior. The overall goal is to expand understanding of the circuits within MD. The
rationale is that understanding of neural processing by the thalamus and thalamic inputs to prefrontal cortex is
necessary for understanding the mechanisms of executive function and developing neuromodulation therapies
targeting the prefrontal network for neuropsychiatric disorders. The central hypothesis will be tested with three
specific aims: 1) Determine how intrinsic properties of MD neurons control synaptic integration of mPFC inputs.
2) Test how MD neurons differentially process synaptic inputs arising from different brain regions. 3) Determine
how optogenetic manipulation of specific MD circuits affects cognitive, social, and affective behaviors in
wildtype mice.
The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it defines the
function of an understudied but essential thalamic nucleus, from the level of membrane biophysics, to synaptic
integration, to control of behavior. The work is significant because it will contribute to the anatomical and
physiological map of prefrontal thalamocortical circuitry. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to guide
the development of future neuromodulation strategies to treat the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders that
localize to the prefrontal network."
10757662,"ABSTRACT
 Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a profoundly devastating tumor predisposing syndrome characterized by
multiple nervous system tumors that cause substantial debility for patients. The hallmark of NF2 is bilateral
vestibular schwannomas (VS) which cause hearing loss, imbalance, brainstem compression and even death.
Both NF2-associated and sporadic VS can develop aggressive cystic degeneration which result in rapid
neurologic decline. There are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies against cystic VS and surgery is the only
treatment. However, surgical outcomes are highly variable, and surgery carries considerable morbidities
including deafness, facial paralysis, brain injury and incomplete resection, due to significant peri-tumoral
adhesions and reliance on imprecise visual cues during tumor dissection. Efforts are needed to identify
biomarkers to classify aggressive VS and develop intraoperative tools to detect tumor cells, visualize the
interface between tumor and cochlear/facial cranial nerves and improve the accuracy of surgical resection.
 This K08 career development award is designed to launch the principal investigator’s career as an
independent surgeon scientist, whose goal is to understand mechanisms that underlie VS growth and cystic
degeneration, identify molecular biomarkers to classify disease, and leverage nanotechnology tools to improve
the precision of tumor surgery. The PI’s mentor (Krystof Bankiewicz) is a leader in delivering therapeutics to
the central nervous system and translational research. The PI’s co-mentor (Long-Sheng Chang) is an expert in
studying the NF2 tumor suppressor gene function in VS. Additional mentorship is provided by a research
advisory committee of experts in nanoparticle delivery (Yizhou Dong), matrix metalloprotease and extracellular
matrix biology (Jennifer Leight), and skull base surgery (Oliver Adunka), along with didactics and workshops at
the Ohio State University and nationally.
 Previously, the PI utilized primary human VS cultures to develop nanoparticles that target VS and identified
a matrix metalloproteinase whose activity was associated with poor surgical outcomes in VS. The proposed
study will: 1) systematically identify proteases dysregulated in VS through spatial transcriptomic profiling; 2)
engineer a library of nanomaterials to rapidly quantify VS protease activity and establish an activity-based
tumor-classifying biomarker; 3) develop protease-sensing, tumor-targeted nanoparticles. Results from this
work will elucidate mechanisms that regulate VS behavior and establish tools to enhance the accuracy of
surgical resection, which could ultimately reduce treatment-associated morbidity, preserve cranial nerve
function and improve outcomes for patients with this devastating disease. Furthermore, the principal
investigator will obtain the training needed to transition into an independent physician scientist focusing on
using nanotechnology to translate biological discoveries into new diagnostics and therapeutics for VS and NF2."

This Mentored Research Career Development Award (K01) proposal includes a coordinated training plan
and research project that will facilitate the candidate's transition to independent investigator at the
intersection of adolescent substance use, in particular marijuana use, sleep disturbances and chronic pain.
Adolescent marijuana exposure predicts many negative outcomes, particularly for early, heavy users.
Chronic pain is an under-recognized, yet highly prevalent adolescent health problem. Evidence suggests
that chronic pain potentiates risk factors for substance use, in particular those related to sleep disturbances
and diminished inhibitory control. However, the interplay among sleep, pain, and inhibitory control, as it
relates to marijuana use in adolescence, remains minimally explored, which is significant given the unique
risk for frequent and heavy marijuana use in this population.
 The proposed research project utilizes mobile health (mHealth) measurement techniques, combining
mobile phones and wearable devices, to enhance our understanding of the longitudinal interplay among
these mechanisms in patient’s natural settings. The long-term goal of this K01 award is for the candidate to
establish an independent research career aimed at developing and implementing mechanistically informed
interventions for marijuana use disorders in youth with chronic pain and sleep disturbances using mHealth
approaches. To do so,
specific short-term training is required in: 1) conducting adolescent substance use
research, with a focus on marijuana use;
2) conducting randomized controlled trials; 3) sleep and circadian
biology and sleep measurement techniques; 4) the use of mHealth technologies and protocols and 5) the
responsible conduct of research.
Two independent, yet related studies are proposed to characterize the relation among sleep, pain,
inhibitory control, and marijuana use
in an adolescent chronic pain population. A first study will interrogate a
large cross-sectional sample of youth with chronic pain to understand the association that particular pain
dimensions (i.e. intensity, frequency and interference) show with marijuana use, both directly and through
associations with sleep and inhibitory control. Given the potentially complex interplay among factors, a
longitudinal assessment is vital to map the unfolding of pathophysiological processes. The second study will
therefore combine ecological momentary assessments, mobile app-based cognitive tests, and passive
collection of sleep data to provide time-sensitive and ecologically valid models of the longitudinal interplay
among risk factors within the context of the individual’s daily life.
 Such methods are vital for mapping temporal sequences of events and developing specific interventions
to interrupt this perpetual cycle and reduce risks, which will be the goal of a subsequent R01 grant."
10729854,"Project Summary:
Chromatins are packed into the tiny nucleus in a way that distal enhancers interact with target gene promoters
in 3D space to facilitate the expression of the target genes in a cell type-specific manner, though enhancers
and promoters are separated by several kilobases or sometimes megabases in the linear forms of chromatins.
Thus, understanding of the chromatin interactions is important for us to interpret the transcription regulatory
networks dictating cell identifies and to reverse or convert cell fate through transcription manipulations.
However, millions of cells are required to profile genome-wide chromatin interactions by conventional proximity
ligation-based chromatin conformation capture methods, making it difficult to interrogate chromatin interactions
in sensory hair cells of the organ of Corti. The lack of enhancer-promoter interaction information in the hair
cells restrains our understanding of the regulatory networks governing hair cell-specific gene expression and
hinders the identification of potential targets for hair cell regeneration through expression manipulation. To
address this need, we are proposing to investigate enhancer-promoter interactions in sensory hair cells
utilizing the “cut-and-paste” transposition activity of Tn5 transposase (Tn5-Capture). The feasibility of Tn5-
Catpure to detect enhancer-promoter interactions has been demonstrated by our preliminary study, we will
start enhancer-promoter interaction analysis for a few essential transcription factor genes using Tn5-Capture
followed by qPCR, and then expand the analysis to genome-wide scale by combining Tn5-Capture and Next
Generation Sequencing. Finally, with the CRISPRi (CRISPR-dCAS9-EZH2) system, we will validate the
regulatory functions of selected enhancer-promoter interactions for already known and newly discovered
enhancer-promoter interactions. Through this project, we will collect datasets of enhancer-promoter
interactions in hair cells, which can be integrated with available transcriptomic and epigenetic data to establish
hair cell regulatory networks governing hair cell-specific gene expression and to identify potential targets to
stimulate hair cell regeneration. Implementation of the CRISPRi technology in the inner ear system also
provide a powerful tool in the context of therapeutical treatment of deafness. Besides, the Tn5-Capture
method, a new chromatin interaction interrogating technique, will have broad applications in research outside
of the inner ear system."
10763490,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains a high prevalence condition in low-and-middle-income countries,
currently affecting at least 40 million people, many of whom suffer premature death. Most patients with RHD
present late, missing the opportunity to benefit from secondary antibiotic prophylaxis. Screening
echocardiography in RHD endemic settings identifies many children with early, latent RHD, but until recently
the effectiveness of prophylaxis to protect children with latent RHD was not known. The GOAL Trial
(conducted in Uganda by this investigative team) found that children with latent RHD who receive
prophylaxis with intramuscular penicillin are less likely to progress at two-years (0.8% penicillin vs. 8.3% no
penicillin, p<0.001). However, despite these results, scale-up of echocardiographic screening and early
initiation of prophylaxis with intramuscular (IM) penicillin for RHD has a myriad of challenges. Among the
most critical are substantial patient (including pain and missed work/school) and health system-level barriers
(including cost, time, and training) to delivering prolonged courses of IM injections in low-resource settings.
Intramuscular vs. Enteral Penicillin Prophylaxis to Prevent Progression of Latent Rheumatic Heart
Disease (GOALIE) will determine if a less burdensome form of prophylaxis, oral penicillin, is non-
inferior to IM penicillin in preventing latent RHD progression. GOALIE is a randomized non-inferiority
trial comparing the efficacy of Intramuscular to Enteral (oral) penicillin prophylaxis to prevent progression of
latent RHD at two years. Based on our strong history of recruitment and retention, we will conduct school-
based echocardiographic screening of ~100,000 children and enroll 1004 children into GOALIE, which will
provide 90% power to determine if oral penicillin prophylaxis is non-inferior to IM penicillin prophylaxis.
GOALIE will also examine economic equivalence and cost-effectiveness of these two prophylaxis strategies
(Aim 2) and the patient reported outcomes between these two strategies (Aim 3), providing critical data to
inform the integration of prophylaxis for latent RHD into clinical practice. GOALIE builds off our decade long
collaboration, including strong Ministry of Health and community support. GOALIE will leverage the structure
of the GOAL Trial which developed streamlined protocols for echocardiographic screening (>102,000
screened) and highly successful recruitment (>99% eligible children), retention (97% completion), and
adherence support (99% adherence) strategies. The results of our study will have high clinical and public
health impact, immediately informing international policy on the standard of care for children diagnosed with
latent RHD."
10791834,"The suicide rate has increased 28% over the past two decades while heart disease, diabetes, and cancer
mortality has declined. Starting in 2011, new standards have led to improved adoption and reach of suicide risk
surveillance in primary and specialty care. Treatment, however, has lagged. Collaborative Care (CoCM) in
primary care settings has demonstrated small but significant reductions in suicidal ideation when a recognized
psychological treatment model is included but not when Collaborative Care only includes medication
management, suggesting that improvements to psychological treatments in Collaborative Care could further
improve suicide outcomes. Developed in a series of conferences in Aeschi Switzerland, the “Aeschi Model”
based on the clinical narrative has become an established approach to suicide care endorsed by leaders across
the suicidology field – including the developers of major evidence-based suicide interventions. With support from
the Methods Core, this Exploratory (R34) study of the University of Washington Practice-Based Suicide
Prevention Research Center will co-design and pilot test the Aeschi Model in Collaborative Care (AM-CoCM) to
intervene at the treatment and follow-up steps on the suicide care pathway with adolescent and young adult
patients in Collaborative Care who do not require immediate crisis intervention. This study will focus on
increasing therapeutic alliance – a key proposed mechanism of the Aeschi approach and the Center. The aims of
AM-CoCM are to partner with the University of Washington Primary Care clinics to (1) Co-design Aeschi and
Collaborative Care intervention components into AM-CoCM with health care providers, adolescents and young
adults with a history of suicidality, and family members of suicidal patients through human centered design; (2)
Conduct iterative treatment development of AM-CoCM to test and refine usability, and then (3) Conduct a pilot
test of the AM-CoCM intervention components compared to treatment as usual in six primary care clinics to
determine (a) usability and acceptability of the intervention components to patients and providers and (b) the
components' potential impact on therapeutic alliance and patient and provider self-efficacy, and (c) potential
impact on suicidal outcomes. Given the strong theoretical basis for AM-CoCM, this proposal has the potential to
develop a high impact intervention for the treatment and follow-up steps of the suicide care pathway in
Collaborative Care that will reduce suicide risk and improves therapeutic alliance – potentially without any
increase in the quantity of care."
10791837,"ABSTRACT
Suicide is the second leading cause of mortality among adolescents and young adults (AYA) and rates of
suicide and emergency department visits for suicide attempts have been increasing in this age group over the
past decade.1-3 Outpatient medical settings may serve as a safety net to improve the detection, management,
and outcomes for AYA with suicidal ideation.4-8 Improving outcomes requires interventions and tools that are
designed for implementation in the fast-paced outpatient medical setting. Practice guidelines and toolkits
recommend that a positive suicide screening be followed by a full assessment and safety planning.9-11
However, healthcare providers in outpatient medical settings have few supports to complete this work.
In this R34 application, we propose to use Human-Centered Design strategies12 with AYA, parents, and
healthcare providers to build and optimize an Integrated Screening and Safety Planning (ISSP) tool for AYA
who screen positive for suicidal ideation in pediatric outpatient medical settings. The tool will include: 1) safety
assessment, 2) algorithms for risk stratification and decision support for HCPs to guide next steps of care, 3)
integrated tools for collaborative safety plan completion with means restriction counseling, and 4) creation of a
registry to improve tracking and follow-up. We then conduct a pilot study with 100 AYA (ages 13-21) in three
outpatient clinics, comparing use of the ISSP tool to the usual care Seattle Children's clinical pathway on the
primary outcomes of AYA Suicide-Related Coping, Parent Suicide Prevention Self-Efficacy, and Provider
Suicide Management Self-Efficacy using a pre-post design. Parents and AYA will complete surveys at
baseline, and 1- and 2-month follow ups, and healthcare providers will complete surveys at three time points:
prior to the control period, after the control period, and after the intervention period.
ISSP provides the opportunity to engage stakeholders and co-design technology that addresses a key
challenge in the assessment of suicidal ideation in medical settings: moving beyond screening to a focus on
improving the completion of screening in a way that empowers AYA, HCPs and parents. If successful, this tool
has the potential for future broad dissemination including adaptations to other medical settings and for use with
other age groups. A key strength of our proposal is the focus on implementation needs alongside intervention
development which will shorten the timeline for tests of efficacy in an R01 trial as well as future dissemination
efforts."
10901836,"Suicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and the 10th leading cause of death in the US. A major
barrier to suicide prevention has been that the cutting-edge scientific advances that have occurred in the past
few decades have not yet been translated and implemented into clinical practice settings. We propose the
development of a practice-based Center for Suicide Research and Prevention (CSRP) that will support the
development, deployment, and evaluation of practice-ready and deployment-focused interventions aimed at
improving the identification and effective treatment of those at risk of suicide. This Center will be a collaborative
effort between researchers, clinicians, and stakeholders at Mass General Brigham (MGB) and Harvard
University. Our focus is on improving the identification and prevention of suicide-related behaviors (SRBs)
among patients presenting for treatment at emergency departments (EDs) and psychiatric inpatient units.
Decades of research have shown that 50% of people who die by suicide are seen in a healthcare setting within
one month before their death, 40% visit an ED the year before their death, and the suicide rate is highest in the
weeks immediately following discharge from a psychiatric inpatient hospitalization. Our first aim is to build and
maintain a cohesive and innovative transdisciplinary Center dedicated to advancing suicide prevention. This
will be accomplished via the work of our proposed Administrative Core and Methods Core. Our second aim
is to conduct four practice-focused research projects that target prediction and prevention of suicidal behaviors
in ED and inpatient settings. Our Signature Project (SIG) will implement a previously-develop machine learning
prediction algorithm based on electronic health record (EHR) and self-report data collected in the ED and
randomly assign the clinicians of 4,000 patients to receive (experimental condition) or not receive (control
condition) the predicted probability that their patient will make a suicide attempt after ED discharge. We will test
the impact of this intervention on the suicide attempt rate and clinician decision-making. The SIG also will
examine clinician acceptability and adherence, prediction model improvement, and the development of
treatment optimization rules regarding patients' likelihood of benefiting from hospitalization versus alternative
treatments. Our three Exploratory Projects (EXP): (EXP1) will use the SIG prediction model to identify ED
patients at risk of suicidal behavior and experimentally test the effectiveness of an enhanced outreach
intervention administered in collaboration with a community partner – Samaritans of Boston; (EXP2) will
implement and test EHR-based risk algorithms in two inpatient units with a special focus on the use of social
determinants of health to improve prediction among under-represented adolescents; and (EXP3) will test a
just-in-time adaptive intervention using an innovative micro-randomized trial design to connect at-risk patients
with care when needed most. The third aim of the Center is to support education, dissemination, and
implementation efforts that will have a significant and sustained effect on suicide prevention."
10901837,"The Administrative Core (AC) will provide overall support and integration of operations for the proposed Center
for Suicide Research and Prevention (CSRP). The CSRP aims to create a unique, interdisciplinary community
and platform for driving practice-based research on suicide prevention, bringing together leading experts,
emerging scholars and trainees, and key stakeholders to develop and implement novel approaches to suicide
prevention. The first specific aim of the AC will be to establish and provide the essential infrastructure and
governance to coordinate activities of the Methods Core (MC) and Center research projects. The AC will be led
by MPIs Jordan Smoller and Matthew Nock, who will also annually alternate chairing the Center Steering
Committee. Key Center activities will be driven by additional committees: Training, Pilot Grant Program,
Disseminations/Communications and Publications (each of which will include Stakeholder representatives.
The work of the AC will be guided by input from an External Advisory Board of leading experts and a
Stakeholder Panel reflecting the diverse perspectives of individuals with lived experience, healthcare
executives, public sector representatives, and community partners who will partner with the Center on
identifying and addressing unmet needs and shaping of ongoing research projects. The AC also will interface
with the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Systems Behavioral Mental Health Committee to ensure
implementation of a learning health system for suicide prevention across the MGB system. AC co-investigators
include senior leaders in psychiatric research, suicide prevention, implementation science and bioethics and
regulatory issuesdrawn from the MGB healthcare system, Harvard University Faculty of Arts and Sciences,
Harvard Medical School, and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Second, the AC will establish
and implement programs to support novel pilot research and an expansion of the workforce devoted to
practice-based suicide research. This will include a Pilot Grant Program to evaluate and fund promising new
directions in suicide research as well as a Collaborating Scholars Program to engage emerging and advanced
career investigators in multidisciplinary research relevant to suicide prevention, with a focus on recruiting
individuals from groups traditionally underrepresented in medicine. Third, the AC will develop tools and
platforms to disseminate evidence-based suicide prevention research and promote outreach to relevant
community partners. This will include the development of the CSRP website, a biannual newsletter, a monthly
all-hands CSRP meeting, and monthly CSRP-sponsored speakers’ series. We also will organize an annual
conference toprovide a national forum for highlighting emerging research related to suicide prevention. Fourth,
in conjunction with the MC and guidance from the CSRP Program Evaluation and Planning Committee, we will
establish and implement a program evaluation plan to allow iterative refinement of the Center's ongoing
activities and inform plans for future growth of the CSRP and collaborative research."
10763402,"Splicing factors are frequently altered by mutations and copy-number changes both in cancer and in
germline genetic diseases resulting in multi-system developmental syndromes. Despite the fact that virtually all
genes in humans undergo splicing, spliceosomal genetic alterations tend to exhibit surprisingly specific effects
on subsets of splicing events, leaving most insignificantly changed. These effects can be allele-specific, cell-type
specific, and dependent on the genetic background of the afflicted cell. This makes it especially challenging to
determine which affected splicing events contribute to disease etiology. The fact that a limited set of introns is
responsive to any specific splicing factor alteration indicates that introns and their flanking exons have evolved
in structure and sequence to confer differential sensitivity to the action of different spliceosome components.
This raises a fundamental question: what are the features common to sets of introns that confer this specificity?
Using naturally occurring splicing gene mutations, amplifications, and deletions, these perturbations will be
modelled in a genetically stable, untransformed, isogenic cell system where it is possible to isolate the effect of a
single alteration on the transcriptome and on the binding patterns of the altered protein. These studies will shed
light on the mechanisms of normal spliceosome function, and provide insight into which genes and biological
pathways affected by splicing dysfunction likely contribute to disease states.
 The proposed experiments will employ three distinct methods to model spliceosome perturbations
associated with human disease, with a focus on factors that physically or functionally interact with the essential
spliceosome protein SF3B1. (Specific Aim 1) Introduction of an allelic series of cancer-associated SF3B1
missense-mutations into isogenic cell lines using recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE); (Specific
Aim 2) CRISPRa/i-mediated activation or inhibition of transcription to up- or down- regulate splicing factors
that are amplified in cancers (PUF60, SF3B4, and U2AF2) and lost in developmental syndromes (PUF60,
SF3B4); and (Specific Aim 3) rapid depletion of spliceosomal RNA helicases (DDX39B, DDX46, and DHX16)
and their putative co-factors (SUGP1, RBM17, and GPKOW) at the protein level using auxin-inducible degrons.
Three distinct methods of RNA sequencing will be used to quantify the changes resulting from these
perturbations: poly(A)-selected RNAseq, allele-specific eCLIP, and a novel intron lariat capture sequencing
approach. Lastly, we will integrate these genomic data sets into models using deep learning neural networks to
interrogate our central hypothesis: the sequence and structure of individual mammalian introns have evolved to
confer differential dependence on specific ‘core’ components of the spliceosome, and that mutations,
amplifications, and deletions in these core components causal for human disease will uncover intron-centric
gene expression regulatory circuits that are controlled though modulation of the abundance or activity of the
associated splicing factors in normal cells."
10897695,"THE HOST PATHOGEN MAP INITIATIVE 2.0
OVERALL SUMMARY
The Host-Pathogen Map Initiative (HPMI) 2.0 is an interdisciplinary program that aims to improve our
understanding of the interactions between host cellular systems and respiratory pathogens and builds upon the
success of its previous iteration. The ultimate goals are identifying therapeutic targets, treatment modalities, and
predicting disease severity. HPMI 2.0 will focus its efforts on the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb) and viral respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern, e.g. omicron and delta, as
well as influenza, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus, among other RNA viruses. We will use
proteomics, genetics and structural biology approaches to study the host factors relevant to these infectious
diseases in disease-relevant cell models and patient samples, and combine our data with existing -omic
datasets. Network and structure modeling approaches will be used to integrate these datasets to make testable
predictions about proteins, complexes and pathways in the host regulating infection as well as disease prognosis.
Our proposal will be centered on the profiling of human samples to decipher networks underlying infectious
respiratory diseases. To generate clinically relevant datasets on viral respiratory disease, we will use human
lung primary cells and three-dimensional human airway organoids (HAO) for systems biology analyses,
determine the global proteome of plasma samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and integrate our data
with clinical datasets. To uncover the determinants of the heterogeneity of susceptibility to TB, we will utilize
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for TB susceptibility genes combined with whole genome sequences
of the infecting Mtb strain in a cohort of TB patients in Vietnam at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit
(OUCRU). We will further profile alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood derived macrophages from healthy
donors to understand mechanisms of innate immune responses to Mtb infection and cell-type specific features.
We hypothesize that different TB clinical outcomes are regulated by specific molecular networks in infected
macrophages. Our models for the identification of combinatorial biomarkers to predict disease outcomes will be
assessed on the Mtb-infected cohort in Vietnam and COVID-19 patients at UCSF. Lastly, we will explore potential
commonalities between Mtb and SARS-CoV-2, as severe forms of TB and COVID-19 are accompanied by
exacerbated inflammatory responses and “cytokine storms”.
A better molecular understanding of the functions and mechanisms of host-pathogen complexes may reveal new
therapeutic strategies for intervention, including strategies of host-directed therapies that circumvent the
limitations of current drug regimens using antibiotics or antivirals where mutations in the pathogen proteins can
diminish drug efficacy. Our host-pathogen cell maps will help build interpretable deep learning systems using
state-of-the-art modeling approaches for prediction of infectious disease risk, disease severity and combinatorial
risk factors for M. tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical settings."

10834975,"Project Summary/Abstract
 More than 52 million American adults report binge drinking in the past month. Binge drinking is intricately
linked to, and exponentially increases the risk for, the development of an alcohol use disorder - a pernicious
illness linked to severe medical and psychiatric morbidity, elevated mortality, and a resistance to conventional
treatments. In tandem, up to 43 million Americans engage in episodes of binge eating, characterized by the
consumption of a large amount of food coupled with a loss of control. Binge eating is inherently linked to the
development of binge eating disorder, the most prevalent eating disorder phenotype, and obesity, which is
among the leading causes of global preventable death. Crucially, binge drinking and binge eating frequently
co-occur, with robust data illustrating a bidirectional antagonistic effect of one binge type behavior upon the
severity and frequency of the other, indicative of shared underlying mechanisms. Although the shared
mechanisms underpinning both binge drinking and binge eating have been well-explicated, few treatments to
date have been developed to target these transdiagnostic maintaining factors. Addressing these mechanisms
early through the use of accessible prevention approaches has important public health implications for
preventing the development of harmful and difficult-to-treat disorders. Importantly, the risk for both binge
drinking and binge eating are substantially elevated in young adults, and particularly among college students,
where paradoxically, rates of treatment seeking for these problematic behaviors are reliably low. Since both
alcohol use disorder and binge eating disorder most typically onset in late adolescence, precision methods to
target these symptomatic behaviors prior to their conversion to full threshold disorders, in the populations most
at-risk, is of critical importance. Moreover, and owing to the reliably low rates of treatment seeking in college
students, the development of precision approaches that are personalized and accessible on a large scale are
especially warranted. In this study, we propose to leverage our group’s experience in developing mobile
phone-based behavioral health interventions, to develop a mobile intervention to dually reduce co-occurring
binge drinking and binge eating by targeting their shared underlying mechanisms. This two-phase study will
first seek to develop and conduct a systematic beta test of the intervention, comprised of components of
evidence-based treatments vetted with experts, in 20 male and female college students who engage in binge
drinking and eating. Subsequently, we will pilot test the refined intervention in a randomized controlled trial of
300 college students who engage in both behaviors, and who will receive the intervention (N=150) or standard
receipt of resources (control; N=150), to ascertain intervention efficacy in reducing binge frequency and related
problems. Results will provide the first known data relating to a scalable and transdiagnostic approach to
reducing binge drinking and eating frequency in a population at heightened risk and limited treatment-seeking."
10813696,"Aberrant metabolism is increasingly recognized as a hallmark of cancer. The Warburg effect is a well-known
example of such abnormal cancer metabolism, which entails a shift away from oxidative to glycolytic glucose
metabolism (despite the presence of oxygen) and usually also increased glucose uptake. The detection of this
increased glucose uptake, via a radioactive analogue (2-18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, FDG) with positron
emission tomography (PET), is often used for diagnosis, staging, and evaluating disease progression of tumors
outside the brain. However, in patients with brain tumors FDG-PET is frequently inconclusive because the normal
high glucose uptake in healthy brain is comparable to that in tumors, thereby obscuring the tumor-to-brain image
contrast. As a result, FDG-PET is not frequently used in these patients. That leaves brain tumor patients without
the benefits of metabolic imaging, which has a significant negative impact on the management of their disease.
 The recently developed MRI-based method, deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) can be an alternative
strategy to detect abnormal glucose metabolism. DMI is based on 3D deuterium (2H) magnetic resonance
spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). After administration of the nonradioactive deuterated glucose, DMI can detect
both glucose and its downstream metabolites lactate and glutamate. In cancer cells that show the Warburg effect
the 2H-labeling in lactate and glutamate reflects the typical shift from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism. DMI can
detect this 2H-labeling and reveal the cancer-specific glucose metabolism with high tumor-to-brain image
contrast. Because of these features and the ease of use of the method, DMI can become a robust metabolic
imaging technique for brain tumors that so far has been missing.
 The goal of this proposal is to validate DMI of glucose metabolism as a potential imaging tool for
neurooncology, particularly for glioblastoma, the most common and lethal primary brain tumor. We envision that,
for patients with brain tumors, DMI can provide a similar benefit as FDG-PET has for many patients with tumors
outside of the brain. In Aim 1 we therefore seek to validate the 2H-labeling pattern in lactate and glutamate
detected with DMI as surrogates of the Warburg effect, by comparing them with absolute measurements of the
Warburg effect in rodent models of GBM. Aim 2 is focused on the potential of DMI to provide an early biomarker
of response to standard of care chemotherapy. To confirm the improved performance of DMI relative to current
clinically available methods, in Aim 3 metabolic maps generated by 1H MRSI, FDG-PET and DMI, are compared
for tumor-to-brain image contrast in patients with GBM. The proposed aims will provide better understanding of
the fundamental processes underlying the DMI-based image contrast, provide the first insight in its value for
monitoring therapy and disease progression, and benchmark its performance as a new metabolic imaging
method. These achievements will strengthen the foundation for further development of DMI as a clinically viable
technology for metabolic imaging."

Chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are among the most prevalent health conditions
in the United States, responsible for 7 out of every 10 deaths. Mississippi ranks first or second in 8 of 10 leading
causes of death, with 90% of the population having 1-2 chronic diseases. While chronic diseases can be treated
through early intervention, targeted medical therapies, and improved diet and exercise, an understanding of
genetic susceptibility and molecular mechanisms involved in disease onset has the potential to halt progression
and return an individual to a healthier state. Advances in technology now allow for unprecedented insight into
genome complexity and its interaction with the environment using genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and
metabolomic datasets. The integration of these datasets with physiological information using computational
approaches can provide systematic insight into the molecular, cellular, and overall physiology associated with
the health-disease continuum. We propose to establish a new Phase I COBRE, the Molecular Center of Health
and Disease (MCHD) to facilitate research under a central theme of molecular physiology to enhance the depth
of education, mentorship, and training of researchers to generate unique opportunities in the application of omics
technology and computational biology. The MCHD will be comprised of multiple components including an
administrative unit, education and mentoring programs, a pilot project program, two research cores, and three
major project investigators. The overall objectives of the MCHD are: (1) to develop infrastructure and state-of-
the-art research core facilities essential for cutting edge basic, clinical, and translational approaches to study the
health and disease continuum. The MCHD, through Core B will enhance existing -omics technology (e.g., single
cell RNAseq and spatial transcriptomics), proteomic capabilities, and establish a new innovative core, involving
CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology to interrogate gene function and biological pathways; and Core C will
establish critical computing infrastructure and computational biology analysis not currently available at the
University; (2) to establish meaningful education, mentoring programs, and research support for promising new
investigators to nurture them into productive, independently funded investigators, who will be effective
collaborators on multidisciplinary research teams. This will be accomplished through offering a “Genetic and -
Omics Academy” (didactic instruction and observership) to strengthen researcher understanding of molecular
and computational approaches, a robust mentoring program involving one-on-one and team mentoring, career
development opportunities, and providing a high level of research support through each core; and (3) to enhance
collaborations and interactions among investigators across multiple disciplines at UMMC, promote cooperation
between other IDeA supported programs, including existing COBRE, IDeA-CTR, and external partnership with

10802288,"Core C-Abstract
The Molecular Center of Health and Disease (MCHD) will facilitate research under a central theme of
molecular physiology to enhance the depth of education, mentorship, and training of researchers to apply omics
technology and computational biology across the health-disease continuum. Research aimed at understanding
genetic susceptibility and molecular mechanisms involved in disease onset has the potential to halt progression
and return an individual to a healthier state. As advances in technology have allowed for insight into genomic,
transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic complexity, the need to develop computational biology approaches
to integrate and merge these omics datasets along with physiological data (in total systems biology) has become
critical. In total, computational approaches applied to molecular, cellular, and overall pathophysiology associated
with the health-disease continuum can provide important systems biology level information. The mission of the
MCHD will be achieved through synergistic interaction across multiple components including Core A
(administrative oversight, education and mentoring programs, and a pilot project program), two research cores,
and three major project investigators to address diverse questions of health and disease using molecule and
computational approaches. In particular, Core C- Research Computing, Bioinformatics, and Biostatistics
will provide researchers access to high-performance research computing infrastructure, custom bioinformatics
analysis pipelines and biostatistical support. Core C will leverage the comprehensive state-of-the-art omics data
collection pipeline and mechanistic gene-editing and biological approaches from Core B to provide major project
and pilot investigators unique insight into the health-disease continuum. Core C will build new computing
infrastructure at the University, provide vital bioinformatics and computational biology analysis, facilitate a novel
“Bioinformatics and Data Sciences Collaborative”, and leverage and expand current biostatistics services
available through the School of Population Health. The objective of Core C is: (1) provide education and training
opportunities for faculty, trainees, and students in research computing and computational biology approaches;
(2) establish an innovative research computing infrastructure required for analyses of large omics datasets via
standard and custom analyses pipelines to return biologically relevant analyses to MCHD investigators; (3)
provide MCHD investigators access to biostatistical expertise and services for optimal experimental design,
statistical analyses, and interpretation of findings; and (4) to seek continuous improvement in research computing
infrastructure, services, and enhance analytical capabilities through implementation of new approaches,
algorithms, and methodology to assist in the sustainability of the Core. In total, through close coordination with
Core B, this core will establish, grow, and sustain infrastructure to enhance and build systems biology focused
approaches to the health and disease continuum, bring together multidisciplinary expertise to support innovative
extramural research applications of junior investigators, and collaboratively cultivate the success of the MCHD."
10758223,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Shortly after fertilization, a dramatic reprogramming of the genome and transcriptome occurs, enabling the
embryo to develop quickly and robustly. This is especially exemplified in the Drosophila embryo, which within a
two-hour period undergoes 13 mitotic cycles, cellularizes the blastoderm, patterns the body plan, and gets ready
for gastrulation. While the gene networks underlying these processes have been well studied, it is not clear how
they are collectively initiated, a process referred to as zygotic genome activation. Moreover, although it was
observed that DNA replication occurs before transcription, the mechanisms that control this timing are not known.
Previously, we demonstrated that a single factor, Zelda, acts globally to activate early-expressed genes. We
found that Zelda binding to CAGGTAG sites across the genome lowers nucleosome barriers at enhancers,
thereby facilitating the binding of other key transcription factors. Zelda and these other factors are present in
sub-nuclear “hubs” (discrete foci) that were seen to colocalize at enhancers. We aim to use high-resolution
microscopy to investigate the which structural features of Zelda mediate hub formation. In addition, we are
interested in the regulatory mechanisms that control the timing of transcription and DNA replication so that
conflicts between the two processes are avoided. We propose that Zelda plays a dual pioneering role: 1) to open
chromatin for the Origin Recognition Complex to load and subsequent formation of the Pre-replication Complex,
which occludes the transcriptional machinery until origins have fired, and 2) to open newly formed chromatin for
transcription to initiate. Our goal is to first define origins of replication in early embryos, and to characterize
Zelda's role in origin licensing and transcriptional initiation. Our studies will lend into how these two fundamental
processes of DNA replication and transcription are coordinated during genome activation."
10806933,"Project Summary
Modern metabolomics have revolutionized biology and biomedical research. It is now possible to identify specific
metabolic biomarkers associated with disease or response to treatment, which can translate into improved
diagnostics. However, key gaps in knowledge remain that limit the impact of metabolomics. First, advances in
analytical instrumentation that fueled the growth of metabolomics are limited to biofluids or extracts of tissues or
cells. Metabolism is a highly dynamic process that can change rapidly with environmental conditions, but most
metabolomics techniques are not able to monitor the dynamic process directly in vivo. Rather, when they are
measured at all, dynamics are measured by discrete sampling, which leads to multiple samples and added
variance. A second limitation in metabolomics is our ability to identify unknown metabolites with high confidence.
Many of the “features” measured by LC-MS or NMR in metabolomics studies remain unknown, limiting the
biological impact.
Our laboratory has recently developed methods to address these gaps in knowledge. Through NIGMS funding,
we have developed improved NMR probes that allow for greater sensitivity in NMR measurements. This is
important because NMR is the best method for unknow metabolite identification. Our current probe will be
commissioned in February 2022 and is optimized for 13C detection at 21.1 T (900 MHz 1H); we expect that it will
provide the highest possible 13C NMR sensitivity available. This technology allows for data that will substantially
improve our ability to identify unknown metabolites. We have also developed metabolite “fraction libraries”, which
start with chemical separation of a specific sample followed by measurement of each fraction by 1D and 2D NMR
and LC-MS/MS. The data from a fraction library will allow unknowns to be identified by efficiently linking the NMR
and LC-MS data. In this MIRA we will make a fraction library knowledgebase by developing tools to connect the
different datasets. We have also developed an approach called continuous in vivo metabolism by NMR (CIVM-
NMR). We have applied CIVM-NMR to growing Neurospora crassa, a filamentous fungus that has been used to
link genetics to metabolism. We can monitor the growth of N. crassa in real-time with about 1 minute resolution
for over 1 week. This allows us to measure quantitative metabolic details of all the metabolites and lipids with
concentrations greater than 25 µM. We have made computational tools to extract over 300 growth curves from
a single CIVM-NMR dataset, allowing us to functionally characterize the metabolic changes over time as a
function of carbon source, temperature, or oxygen availability. In this MIRA project, we will expand CIMV-NMR
by measuring metabolic mutants under different environments and build a web server that connects all the data."
10764803,"Voltage-gated ion channels shape electrical signaling in the excitable cells of nerve and muscle. Sodium (NaV)
and calcium channels (CaV) drive membrane depolarization and activate second messenger pathways via gated
cellular entry of their namesake ions. In skeletal and cardiac cells, CaV channels trigger muscle contraction.
Voltage-gated potassium channels (KV) allow the release of potassium ions from within the cell to drive
membrane repolarization. In concert, these channels provide the molecular foundation for thought, perception,
and contraction. High-resolution protein structures of human voltage-gated channels are now providing the first
glimpses of the types of poses they may adopt in cellular environments. However, understanding the ultimate
link between how these proteins look and how they support physiological mechanisms is a major challenge that
will require innovative approaches. For one, transmembrane voltage is absent in a structural experiment thus
depicting voltage-gated channels in an essentially non-physiological environment. We are therefore developing
photochemical `stapling' approaches to covalently trap high-value protein conformations in live cell membranes
prior to purification for structural determination. Further, we have begun to identify mechanisms of channel
function by introducing modified chemistries at the peptide backbone in the transmembrane segments that form
voltage-sensors and channel gates. In cellular settings, ion channels are also critical amplifiers of transduction
pathways. During the fight-or-fight response, for instance, the near instantaneous phosphorylation of CaV1.2
channels results in faster and sustained channel opening, leading to a more forceful and rapid heart rate. Yet
the absolute speed and complexity of the process is a challenge to experimentally parse individual molecular
events that result in channel gating modifications. We describe newly validated methods that enable light
controlled, site-specific phosphorylation, for the careful deconstruction and identification of key steps and players
is this process. Lastly, CaV channels can be therapeutically inhibited to manage pain, epilepsy, arrythmia, high
blood pressure, and alternatively, activated to treat heart failure. Surprisingly, both of these effects (channel
activation and inactivation) can be elicited by medicines binding a common extracellular binding site on the
channel. Conversely, unintended blockade of cardiac hERG potassium channels by otherwise useful
therapeutics cause 90% of drug induced long-QT syndrome, a potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmia. All of these
chemical binding events rely on aromatic rich binding sites formed by the side-chains of phenylalanine and
tyrosine residues in CaV and hERG channels. To better understand these chemical interactions, we have
developed a high-resolution method that allows for energetic and nuanced dissection of these aromatics within
the CaV and KV drug binding aromatic boxes in the environment of mammalian cells. The successful execution
of this research program will provide cutting edge training opportunities, advance the molecular understanding
of channel gating, and will reveal the binding modes of clinical drugs with high therapeutic value."

at unprecedented small scale and high-resolution
Project summary
The cell surfaceome is the primary hub that allows cells to sense and respond to changes in their environment,
yet only a minority of the estimated 4000-5000 plasma membrane and secreted proteins have been functionally
characterized. We understand even less about coordinate regulation of the surfaceome, and specifically how the
composition, complexes, distribution, and function of membrane proteins are altered to collectively mediate
changes to cellular phenotypes. Our long-range goal is to systematically understand how cells remodel
their membrane proteome (surfaceome) in health and disease, and to develop antibodies that probe and
modulate these processes. With the support of the R35 MIRA in the last five years, we have extensively
characterized the surfaceome changes induced by oncogene transformation leading to discovery of new
biomarkers, cancer drug targets, and generation of highly specific antibodies. In the next five years, we will
develop new surfaceome technologies for small scale analysis of cell populations, particularly in
neurodegeneration using iPSC derived models and patient-derived samples. We will define the cell surface
protein complexes and interactomes using a high-resolution proximity labeling method enabled by Dexter Energy
Transfer (DET). We plan to interrogate the
interactome of EGFR family receptors in i ii iii

 Ir

small scale surfaceomics and interactomics will
dramatically improve our abilities to map cell
surfaces and their intreactomes in diseases
ranging from cancer, immunology, neurology,
and more. We have produced recombinant Figure 1. Overview of development of surfaceomics technologies.
antibodies to 100s of cell surface proteins using
phage, yeast, and mammalian display, and we anticipate the expanded efforts in understanding the surfaceome
will advance the development of highly selective antibodies that probe and modulate cellular states. We began
this vision in our first R35 grant by defining the surfaceomes induced by specific oncogenes in cancer. Next, we
will greatly expand surfaceomics science to much smaller scales of specialized and primary cells, and much
higher resolution analysis of signaling interactomes."
10771132,"This project proposal seeks to build and strengthen an existing program for high school students to perform mentored research during the summer, Brain Research Apprenticeships in New York at Columbia (BRAINYAC). Since 2013, BRAINYAC has trained and prepared 108 high school students from low-resourced neighborhoods in New York City for summer research experiences in neuroscience laboratories at Columbia University in the City of New York. We will provide high school students from underprivileged communities and/or who are under-represented minorities the necessary support for a competitive college application and insight into science research as a career choice. We propose to recruit students through partnerships with youth-serving programs and an inclusive application process. We aim to improve students’ scientific knowledge and confidence in key scientific skills through directed training, mentoring and research experience. We will achieve this via the two main parts of the program: (A) A comprehensive training program during the spring that incorporates parental involvement, training sessions focused on science content, critical thinking skills, and communication skills, and orientation sessions to assist students in choosing a mentor and laboratory. These sessions are co-developed and run by a scientist and a science educator. (B) Summer laboratory experiences combined with weekly advisory sessions, a final poster presentation and field trips including a social event and a professional development event at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). We aim to support our participants’ career development and college applications in STEM fields. We will achieve this through comprehensive support structure to work toward our goal of encouraging students to pursue studies and careers in STEM. We will track our success using a mixed-methods evaluation plan and an alumni engagement program including additional opportunities for alumni. In this way, we will reinforce our participants’ intent to pursue studies or careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)."

The vast majority of the human proteome is considered “undruggable.” Undruggable proteins may be difficult
to express, lack surface binding clefts, do not have corresponding activity assays, or some combination thereof.
This concept is symptomatic of a major liability of contemporary drug discovery, which requires significant
investment to generate and scale up protein expression or cell culture and engineering an activity assay for
every new target. It may be possible to bypass these bottlenecks by directly targeting translation intermediates,
or “ribosome nascent chains” (RNCs), with small molecules that selectively inhibit protein synthesis by
interacting with an RNC and stalling translation. RNCs represent a vast source of new drug targets that do not
follow the rules of druggability, but high-throughput screens for RNC-targeting “Selective Terminators of
Protein Synthesis” (SToPS) have been roundly unsuccessful due to the limited scope of structures in standard
compound screening decks. During the previously funded project, our instrumentation and systems
engineering laboratory developed solid-phase DNA-encoded library (DEL) synthesis methods and microfluidic
DEL screening technology that collectively enabled unprecedented activity-based screens on these large
collections of novel chemical matter. We demonstrated that this platform can efficiently search DELs of
drug-like small molecules to identify novel bioactive molecules for several clinically relevant drug targets. The
proposed MIRA program will leverage our activity-based DEL screening capabilities to establish a SToPS
discovery platform through two parallel technology development initiatives. The first is a synthetic
biology-driven microfluidic droplet-scale in vitro translation-based approach to identifying small molecule
SToPS of a specific target RNC. The second is a polymer/tissue culture engineering approach that will explore
cellular assays of translation stalling, the screening format that identified the original examples of SToPS
targeting the hypercholesterolemia-associated protein, PCSK9. Both approaches will benefit from DEL-based
chemical diversity, which can be designed to explore chemical space known to elicit ribosome binding and
selective translation stalling. Cellular DEL screening technology will ensure that screening hits are cell active,
and more broadly will deliver a long-sought screening modality to the field of drug discovery. Following
proof-of-concept SToPS screens, we will develop computational workflows that mine publicly available
ribosome profiling data sets to predict candidate stall sites for SToPS screening, tackling CCR5 (anti-HIV) and
the bacterial signal sequence as examples of undruggable targets. We envision a completely plug-and-play
chemical probe discovery strategy for translating human genome sequence directly into SToPS as chemical
probes, thereby fulfilling the original vision of the Human Genome Project and eliminating “undruggable” from
the drug discovery lexicon."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia affecting well over 2 million people in the US with
projections that it will affect 8-12 million people by 2050. It is responsible for >$6 billion in annual health care
expenditures in the United States. While catheter ablation is a somewhat effective treatment for AF, its
application generates additional left atrial (LA) fibrosis, an approach that can be associated with proarrhythmia
and reduction in left atrial function. Thus, it would be desirable to identify new targets for prevention and
treatment of AF that focus on the underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities which may vary among patients.
Obesity and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) have been associated with AF. LAEAT, due to its contiguity to the
LA, may directly influence LA substrate via profibrotic, inflammatory, and other adipocytokines. It has been
shown that EAT may play an independent role in the progression, development and recurrence of AF after
catheter ablation. There are known racial/ethnic differences in the incidence of AF that parallel the noted racial
differences in EAT. Yet, the precise role of EAT and, in particular, LAEAT in the pathogenesis of AF is not well
characterized. A 2016 State-of-the-Art review in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology noted “the
integration of metabolomics with other ‘omics’ platforms will allow us to gain insight into pathophysiological
interactions of metabolites, proteins, genes, and disease states, while advancing personalized medicine”. This
novel approach has not been implemented in AF. The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the role of EAT
and, in particular, LAEAT in the pathogenesis of AF using a multi-omic (proteome, metabolome, transcriptome)
approach in order to identify novel potential diagnostics and therapeutic targets. Our specific aims are to: 1) In
a multiracial/ethnic population, evaluate associations of LAEAT with plasma biomarkers known to be
associated with AF. We will enroll 120 patients with AF and 120 controls from the outpatient cardiology practice
– 40 white, 40 black, and 40 Hispanic in each group of both patients and controls and evaluate the effects of
race/ethnicity on the relationship of LAEAT to biomarkers of fibrosis and inflammation, among others. 2)
Examine the LAEAT transcriptome in patients with and without AF. We will enroll 60 patients undergoing
cardiac surgery and obtain EAT biopsies for analysis for upregulation of genes encoding for factors that can
promote atrial fibrosis. RNA-seq analysis will cover all aspects of the transcriptome without any prior
knowledge of it, allowing for the analysis of novel transcripts, splice variants and noncoding RNAs. 3)
Determine cross-sectional associations between EAT and metabolomic features derived from metabolomics of
stored blood specimens in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and the Rotterdam Study and test for
associations between the identified metabolites and incident AF. We will perform an external validation in the
Dallas Heart Study. In the aggregate, these 3 aims will provide a novel platform for the diagnostic evaluation of
AF which may enable development of targeted treatments based on addressing the pathogenesis of AF."

Immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) has revolutionized the care of several malignancies, resulting in durable
response and even cure in a small subset of cancer patients. However, unlike tumors that are highly responsive
to ICT (e.g., melanoma), the majority of patients with advanced prostate cancer respond poorly to ICT and no
survival benefits have been observed in non-selective patients. Although recent preclinical and clinical studies
have shed some light on the mechanisms of immunoresistance in prostate cancer, the cellular and molecular
basis of immunoresistance in prostate cancer remains poorly characterized.
 Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a group of pathologically activated monocytes and
neutrophils with potent immunosuppressive activities, have been implicated as one of the key mechanisms in
driving tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance, including resistance to ICT, in various
cancers. MDSCs can be classified as polymorphonuclear or granulocytic MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs or G-MDSCs)
or monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs), with PMN-MDSCs as the predominant population in most cancer types. We
and others have demonstrated that PMN-MDSCs are the major MDSC subset in mouse and human prostate
cancers, playing an important role in prostate cancer progression and resistance to anti-androgen therapy and
ICT. Correspondingly, therapeutically targeting MDSCs delays prostate cancer progression and improves
responses to anti-androgen therapy and ICT in preclinical models. Importantly, PMN-MDSCs may be clinically
relevant to prostate cancer, as they are abundantly present in both primary and metastatic tumors.
 Emerging evidence suggests that metabolic reprogramming of PMN-MDSCs plays an important role in
their immunosuppressive activities, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly defined. Through
transcriptome analyses (single-cell RNA-seq, microarray, and bulk RNA-seq) of multiple datasets, we identified
Acod1, which encodes cis-aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1), as one of the most highly expressed metabolic
genes in immunosuppressive PMN-MDSCs. ACOD1, which catalyzes the synthesis of itaconate from cis-
aconitate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is a novel immunomodulator with potent anti-inflammatory and
antimicrobial effects in mammalian cells, especially in macrophages. Our results unexpectedly showed that
ACOD1 may also be a potential regulator of PMN-MDSCs. We hypothesize that ACOD1 promotes tumor
progression and resistance to ICT in prostate cancer through metabolic reprogramming of PMN-MDSCs. We will
test our hypothesis in the following aims: Aim 1). Determine the role of ACOD1 in regulating the
immunosuppressive activities of PMN-MDSCs. Aim 2). Determine the role of ACOD1 in PMN-MDSCs in driving
prostate cancer progression. Aim 3). Determine whether Acod1 KO improves the response of prostate cancer to
ICT."

Concussions occur at an alarming rate among U.S. schoolchildren, with one in five children experiencing a
concussion by age 16. The number of children visiting emergency departments for concussions annually has
increased by 50% over the past decade, with an estimated cost to the healthcare system of $1 billion/year.
Compared to adults, children experience longer and more severe postconcussive symptoms (PCS). Severity
and duration of PCS, however, vary considerably among children, complicating clinical care and return to learn
and play. Persistent PCS including physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms, result in increased school
absenteeism, social isolation, and psychological distress. Early PCS diagnosis and access to evidence-based
return-to-health and -school interventions are strongly linked to positive health and academic outcomes. Yet
models to identify children at high risk for persistent PCS are lacking. PCS have been linked to inflammatory
processes occurring within the injured brain. Preliminary evidence suggests that fatigue, another symptom
likely contributing to poor outcomes, is also a biological byproduct of pediatric concussions. Importantly, even
though 73% of children report continuous fatigue after concussion, this symptom is rarely studied along with
other PCS. Prior research has focused on the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and PCS severity
but has not examined this relationship longitudinally. Acute symptom severity alone, however, is a poor
prognostic of clinical outcomes in concussed children. Symptom severity immediately postinjury does not
explain why at least 25% of children still experience PCS after 1 year or why even children who may appear
asymptomatic still report academic and social challenges months after concussion. To identify which children
are at high risk for persistent PCS and poor health, academic, and social outcomes, research tracking PCS
trajectories and describing school-based impacts across the entire first year postinjury is critically needed. This
proposal will 1) define novel PCS trajectory typologies in a racially/ethnically diverse population of 500 children
with concussion (11–17 years, near equal distribution by sex), 2) identify associations between these
typologies and patterns of inflammatory biomarkers, 3) develop a risk stratification model to identify children at
risk for persistent PCS; and 4) gain unique insights and describe PCS impact, including fatigue, on longer-term
academic and social outcomes. We will be the first to use NIH's symptom science model and patient-reported
outcomes to explore the patterns of fatigue and other physical, cognitive, psychological, emotional and
academic responses to concussion in children over a full year. Our model will enable clinicians and educators
to identify children most at risk for poor long-term health, social, and academic outcomes after concussion.
This work is critical to meeting our long-term goal of developing personalized concussion symptom-
management strategies to improve outcomes and reduce disparities in the health and quality of life of children."

10775821,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Background: In older adults, individual prescribing decisions may appear reasonable in isolation yet can lead
to a tangled web of complications. A key exemplar of this is prescribing cascades. These occur when a
medication causes an adverse effect, and rather than changing the offending drug, a second medication is
given to manage the symptoms. This in turn may cause more adverse effects that are managed with a third
medication, and so forth. While relevant for all older adults, cascades may be particularly common and harmful
in people with dementia, in part because communication challenges may increase the risk that clinicians will
not recognize that an adverse drug effect has occurred, and instead interpret new signs or symptoms as the
manifestation of an underlying disease. Although prescribing cascades are likely common and can confer
substantial morbidity, there has been remarkably little scholarship on this topic. In this proposal we will explore
two potential cascades that are models of this problem: (A) gabapentin and pregabalin  peripheral edema 
loop diuretics, and (B) loop diuretics  urinary symptoms  medications used to treat urinary symptoms.
Aims: (1) To determine the prevalence and risk factors for a prescribing cascade involving gabapentinoids and
loop diuretics, and how these differ between older adults with and without dementia; (2) To determine the
prevalence and risk factors for a prescribing cascade involving loop diuretics and urinary symptom
medications, and how these differ between older adults with and without dementia; (3) To characterize the
pathways through which the gabapentinoid-loop diuretic cascade occurs in these populations.
Methods: Using national data from VA and Medicare, for Aims 1 and 2 we will assemble a retrospective cohort
of older adults who were non-users of both the index medication (the one that starts the cascade) and the
outcome medication (the one used to treat adverse effects caused by the index medication). We will then
identify which subjects subsequently started the index medication and which did not start the index medication
but instead started another type of medication (i.e., a control group). We will compare use of the outcome
medication between these groups using multivariable time-to-event approaches that account for competing
risks. Interaction terms and stratified analyses will be used to compare outcome rates and risk factors among
people with and without dementia. For Aim 3, we will conduct chart review on 500 subjects (250 with dementia
and 250 without) with the gabapentinoid-loop diuretic cascade and evaluate elements of decision-making that
contributed to the cascade. The proposed research will provide tremendous opportunities for mentoring junior
investigators and supporting the mentoring aims of this K24 award.
Relevance / public health significance: Understanding prescribing cascades and the patterns of decision-
making that lead to them will inform strategies to prevent and mitigate these potentially harmful practices."

therapy (cART). HIV latency, and cell-specific expression of HIV transcript in human CNS remains

increasing recognition of CNS viral escape in people stably suppressed with cART. One of the major
issues regarding CNS HIV in need for study is HIV integration. With other words, whether CNS HIV
integration has biologically significant impact, contributing to pathogenesis? Issues of CNS functional
deficit are further complicated by the co-registered epidemic of opiate and other substance use
disorders (SUD) in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), as SUD also have profound impact on CNS

neuroanatomic overlap of HIV and SUD in striatonigral dopaminergic circuitry and frontostriatal
projections, sites of predilection for functional and neurobiologic disease as well as for increased burden
of HIV infection. Accordingly, directly utilizing brain tissues in these regions, from neurologically well-
characterized HIV-infected individuals with and without SUD, the goal of this application will be: (i) to
replicate for brain some of the emerging genomic mechanisms recently discovered in peripheral cells,
linking HIV host genome integration and virus latency to nuclear topography and open chromatin; (ii) to

to offer novel insights into transcriptomic landscapes in specific brain cells and explore potential links
between neurogenomic status of the infected brain and neurological and cognitive symptoms and

Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoids hold great promise for tissue engineering and
personalized drug screening, but obtaining the desired multicellular organization and function from these
systems is usually performed in an ad hoc fashion without forward design specification. Recently, we reported
successful liver bud formation containing stromal cells, vascular tube-like structures and hematopoiesis-like
processes by synthetically inducing diversity in GATA6 expression from a single hiPSC population. This
accomplishment suggests that expanding circuit logic operations to artificially control differentiation drivers at
particular bifurcations in lineage specification could profoundly impact the complexity and functionality of
organoids. In this project, we bring together mathematical modeling, machine learning, optimization, and
innovative synthetic biology techniques to elucidate and design fundamental decision and communication rules
for guiding cells into complex, heterogeneous tissues. Our overarching hypothesis is that appropriate timing and
predictable stochastic control of the expression of intracellular and extracellular factors is critical for redirecting
lineage choices in order to elicit desired multicellular organization from a population of differentiating cells. We
will develop synthetic tools for sensing differentiation stages of iPSC-derived organoids and construct and
characterize a stochastic commitment switch in an inducible reporter system. These tools will be integrated in
synthetic gene circuits for engineering emergent multicellular organization through stochastic temporal control
of developmental factors. The modular commitment switches developed in this project will be capable of
exploring how the degree of subpopulation biasing of cell fate decisions and level of cell fate synchronization at
bipotent differentiation stages impacts self-assembly and emergent multicellular organization of an organoid.
Our aims - executed through a closed loop of computational and experimental investigations - will shed insight
on how generalizable methods of controlled manipulation can elicit desired organoid-level emergent properties."

Project 1 will study the updating of imprinted responses to influenza infection and vaccination that occurs
during subsequent influenza vaccination. The hypothesis is that imprinting of B cell memory to influenza by
initial infection will induce more neutralization but less breadth directed at heterologous strains, while initial
imprinting by influenza vaccine will provide greater breadth but less neutralizing activity. Project 1 will test
this hypothesis in a series of experiments in humans and rhesus macaques, in which we will probe the
B cell repertoires in response to combinations of influenza infection and vaccination. Project 1 will perform
experiments in non-human primates where the exposure to influenza antigens can be tighly controlled and
will collect samples from humans of all ages receiving influenza vaccination to quantify responses in a “real
world” setting. For all aims, the goals will be to 1) quantify the effect of exposure to different influenza
subtypes by infection and vaccination, 2) quantify recall upon antigenic challenge by vaccination or infection
and 3) quantify the epitope specific response to influenza. We will pursue these golas using serology,
Nojima cultures, and monoclonal antibody (mAb) isolation, for epitope mapping and structural studies, in
collaboration with Project 4."

The ability to navigate from one place to another is essential for a flourishing and autonomous
human life. Cognitive scientists have long believed that navigation in humans and animals is
guided by mental representations of the spatial structure of the world, which are referred to as
“cognitive maps” because they play a functional role that is similar to physical maps. Consistent
with this idea, electrophysiologists have identified neurons in rodent brains that fire as a
function of spatial variables that are essential elements of a cognitive map, such as location,
distance, and heading direction, while cognitive neuroscientists have investigated possible
neural correlates of cognitive maps in several regions of the human brain, including the
hippocampal formation (HF) and the retrosplenial complex (RSC). Notably, these brain regions
are also known to be essential for several important cognitive functions besides spatial
navigation, including memory, imagination, and thinking about the future. However, despite
this previous work, there remain two crucial gaps in our knowledge. First, we have an
incomplete understanding of how cognitive maps are represented in the human brain.
Behavioral studies indicate that our spatial knowledge is often fragmented, hierarchically
organized, and distorted in multiple ways compared to metric truth, and we do not yet
understand how these “real” cognitive maps are represented in brain structures such as HF and
RSC. Most notably, we do not understand how the brain divides environments into spatial parts
(such as rooms within a building, or neighborhoods in a city), and how it then combines these
parts into a larger whole. Second, we do not yet have a good theory of how spatial cognitive
maps can be applied to non-spatial domains, thus allowing brain structures such as HF and RSC
to mediate both spatial and nonspatial functions. The current project will address these issues
by using advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as multivoxel pattern analysis and individual
difference analyses to: (i) identify the neural mechanisms that allow the brain to encode
subspaces within a larger space; (ii) delineate the neural processes by which subspaces
representations are combined into a larger cognitive map, and (iii) understand how the
principles underlying spatial cognitive maps can be applied to nonspatial domains. This project
has the potential to make a major and sustained advance in the field by resolving longstanding
questions about the cognitive and neural systems underlying spatial navigation, and by
providing fundamental knowledge about how the brain mediates a wide range of basic cognitive
functions, including not just navigation, but also semantic and episodic memory, prospective
thinking, and reasoning."

This project will continue and expand the collection and distribution of data on young adults in families partici-
pating in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). PSID is a longitudinal survey of a nationally representa-
tive sample of U.S. families that began in 1968. As of 2020, it has collected data on the same families and their
descendants for 41 waves over 52 years. In the 1990s, PSID began collecting rich and detailed data on chil-
dren born into these families as part of the original PSID Child Development Supplement (CDS) and, starting in
the mid-2000s, has closely followed these children’s transition across the young adult years through the bien-
nial PSID Transition into Adulthood Supplement (TAS). Young adults in PSID families become members of the
Core PSID themselves and receive the full biennial interview when they form their own economically independ-
ent households—and are followed by the study for the rest of their lives. In order to continue capturing the tran-
sition into adulthood for all PSID children, this project will conduct two waves of TAS in 2021 and 2023. A ma-
jor portion of the TAS sample in 2021 and 2023 will comprise of young adults who previously participated in
CDS. Participants in CDS include those from the original study, which began collecting detailed and extensive
data on children in PSID families in 1997 on a cohort of children aged 0–12 years, as well as the new, ongoing
CDS, fielded in 2014 and 2019, which is collecting information on all children aged 0–17 years in PSID families
born after the launch of the original CDS. TAS in 2021 and 2023 will also include many respondents who have
participated in one or more prior waves of TAS, allowing us to continue tracing their transition into adulthood.
The specific aims are to collect approximately 70 minutes of information in 2021 and 2023 from all PSID youth
aged 18–28 years and to document and distribute these data through the publicly available and free PSID
Online Data Center. We will build upon the major revision of the TAS instrument in 2017 and the adoption in
2019 of a mixed-mode design using internet interviewing as well as computer-assisted telephone interviewing
to collect new retrospective content in 2021 and 2023 on childhood circumstances and exposures and new in-
formation on young adult transitions in key domains such as family formation and change, health, and living
arrangements. Interviews will be conducted with approximately 3,500 young adults in 2021 and 2023. These
data are vital for our understanding of the contemporary transition from adolescence into adulthood in the U.S.
within its intergenerational family context. By augmenting the panel information in the CDS and Core PSID, this
project will provide a rich CDS-TAS-PSID panel of children from birth and preschool through primary and sec-
ondary school and then through entry into the world of work or of higher education in conjunction with early
family formation. Although a full and detailed panel from birth to young adulthood is valuable in its own right,
the information on these individuals will grow further as they continue in Core PSID for the rest of their lives."

 Existing approaches to estimate and characterize whole brain time-varying connectivity from fMRI data have
shown considerable promise, with exponential growth in research in this field. We and others have developed a
powerful set of tools that are now in wide use in the community. However, the impact of mental illness on brain
connectivity is complex, and as we show, limitations in existing methods often result in missing important features
associated with brain disorders (e.g. transient fractionation of the spatial structure of brain networks). Some of
these important limitations include 1) the most widely-used approaches often require a number of prior and
limiting assumptions that are not well studied, 2) methods often assume linear relationships either within or
between networks over time, and 3) methods assume spatially fixed nodes and ignore the possibility of spatially
fluid evolution of networks over time. We propose a novel family of models that builds on the well-structured
framework of joint blind source separation to capture a more complete characterization of (potentially nonlinear)
spatio-temporal dynamics while providing a way to relax other limiting assumptions. Our models will also produce
a rich set of metrics to characterize the available dynamics and enable in depth comparison with currently avail-
able models including those that are model based. We will extensively validate our approaches in a variety of
ways including simulations and evaluation of rigor and robustness in large normative data sets. Finally, we will
apply the developed tools to study the important area of dynamic properties in mental illnesses including schiz-
ophrenia, bipolar disorder, and the autism spectrum. There is considerable evidence of disruption of dynamics
in all three disorders, and as we show the use of static (or even exiting dynamic) approaches can miss important
information about brain related differences associated with each. We will provide open source tools and release
data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRC repository, hence enabling other
investigators to use our approaches and compare their own methods with our own. Our tools have wide appli-
cation to the study of the healthy brain as well as many other diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder.

10806128,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The MMPs have long been recognized as potential targets for cancer therapy, but drugs developed to target
these enzymes have been unsuccessful. A primary reason has been inadequate selectivity, since most MMP
inhibitors cannot discriminate among MMPs that drive cancer progression and other MMPs that prevent cancer
progression. We have recently developed a new approach, expertise, and methodology for engineering much
more highly selective MMP inhibitors based on a human protein, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2
(TIMP2). In our recently published work, we have created an engineered variant of the TIMP2 N-terminal
domain (N-TIMP2) with greatly improved selectivity toward MMP-9, an enzyme critically involved in triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC) progression and metastasis. In preliminary studies, we find that this prototype
inhibitor shows enhanced activity for blocking TNBC cellular invasion. We propose to further engineer N-
TIMP2 for increased selectivity toward MMP-9 and also for enhanced affinity toward α3β1 integrin, a second
natural target of TIMP2 through which TIMP2 mediates inhibition of tumor growth. We will define the structural
basis for selective MMP binding of engineered N-TIMP2 variants to enable yet greater molecular
improvements, and we will evaluate the therapeutic potential of these engineered proteins in multiple
complementary preclinical models of TNBC. In Aim 1, we will use a combination of structural insights,
computational design and yeast surface display (YSD) technology to engineer N-TIMP2, further optimizing
selectivity toward MMP-9 and enhancing beneficial integrin binding activity. In Aim 2, we will elucidate
structures of the engineered proteins with target and anti-target MMPs using X-ray crystallography, to uncover
the structural basis for engineered selectivity and to facilitate yet greater refinements of our engineering
platform and our selective MMP-9 inhibitors. In Aim 3, we will use complementary mouse orthotopic,
transgenic, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC to evaluate the utility of engineered N-TIMP2
variants as a therapeutic strategy in TNBC, and identify candidate biomarkers of response with potential for
directing this therapeutic approach to patients who will most benefit from it. Our proposal is both conceptually
and technically innovative in the combination of approaches toward generating novel protein therapeutics. The
proposed research is highly significant because it has substantial potential to develop an entirely new
approach for targeted treatment of TNBC by selectively inhibiting MMP-9, a well-validated target with key roles
in tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis."
10795830,"Summary- Cells in vivo travel through confining three-dimensional (3D) pores between fibrillar extracellular
matrix (ECM) networks or channel-like tracks bordered by ECM bundles, vessels, myofibers or nerves. The
mechanisms enabling cell locomotion in diverse microenvironments are adaptive in response to the physical and
biochemical cues, such as confinement, stiffness, viscoelastic properties and composition of ECM. Adaptive
systems/modules include cell-ECM interactions, the actomyosin cytoskeleton and cell volume regulation.
Recently, we and others have also identified the key role of the nucleus in confined migration. However,
numerous fundamental and translational questions remain unanswered on the crosstalk between nuclear
mechanosensing, cytoskeleton and cell volume regulation, and their contributions to confined migration in health
and disease. The overarching goal of this project is to employ state-of-the-art bioengineering, materials and
imaging tools as well as in vivo models to provide a novel unified framework for efficient migration in confinement
by deciphering the interplay between nuclear mechanics, cytoskeleton and ion channels. This R01 application
will test the hypothesis that the nucleus senses and responds to physical confinement by exquisitely regulating
the spatial activation of RhoA along the longitudinal cell axis in confined spaces via the synergistic roles of
confinement-induced nuclear stiffening and anillin/Ect2 nuclear exit to the cytoplasm. This hypothesis is
supported by intriguing preliminary data showing that cell entry into confining µ-channels induces nuclear
stiffening which activates RhoA and supports ion channel-dependent nuclear blebbing and rupture. Nuclear
rupture induces the exit of anillin and the RhoGEF Ect2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Anillin accumulates
specifically at the cell poles, where it locally bridges Ect2, RhoA and actomyosin, thereby exacerbating RhoA-
myosin II contractility. In Aim 1, we will decipher the mechanisms of anillin exit to the cytoplasm, and demonstrate
its critical role as a scaffolding protein, which bridges Ect2, RhoA and actomyosin at the cell poles, thereby
regulating the spatial activation of RhoA and bleb-based migration in confinement. We will also elucidate the
novel crosstalk between cell volume regulation and anillin/Ect2/RhoA in nuclear blebbing and rupture in
confinement. Lastly, we will decipher the contributions of nuclear pushing from the cell rear versus nuclear pulling
from the cell front (i.e., nuclear piston model) to migration as a function of the degree of confinement. In Aim 2,
we will extend the applicability of our findings to 3D gels and confining µ-channels of prescribed physiologically
relevant mechanical properties in vitro. We will also visualize the distinct localization patterns of anillin, Ect2 and
key ion channels in natural tissue tracks of different dimensions in vivo, and test how perturbations of these
molecules impact local and distant tissue invasion in vivo. This work will also develop and establish novel
bioengineering tools (e.g., optogenetic probes, µ-fluidic chamber) for better understanding cell motility in health
and disease."
10806196,"The burden on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is growing due to longer life span and lack of effective treatment. The
knowledge gap exists for early detection and prediction of symptom onset. AD pathology (amyloid/tau) and
synaptic dysfunction precedes symptoms by decades and offers a window of opportunity for early AD
detection. Current early AD diagnosis depends on expensive imaging or invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
detection of amyloid/tau. Our goal is to identify non-invasive biomarkers that fill this gap with simple tests
benchmarked to amyloid/tau biomarkers. Our early studies defined pre-symptomatic AD: elderly study
participants were classified as cognitively healthy (CH) in a multi-domain, neuropsychometric battery. We
classify CH participants into two groups based on a regression-derived CSF Aß42/Tau ratio cutoff: CH
individuals with pathological ratio (CH-PAT) or with normal ratio (CH-NAT). After 4 years, 40% of CH-PAT but
no CH-NAT individuals declined cognitively, providing a strong cohort to evaluate biomarkers for pre-
symptomatic AD (CH-PATs) from normal aging (CH-NATs).
AD affects multiple nervous systems. Tightly related to our health, the interactions between conscious
executive function, subliminal processing, and autonomic regulation (CSA system) respond to internal and
external stimuli with neural oscillations that are affected by synaptic dysfunctions. The CSA neural oscillations
can be detected by non-invasive electrophysiological methods: EEG and ECG, benchmarked to amyloid/tau.
Individual CSA dysfunctions have been reported in the mild cognitive impairment stage, while CSA has not
been studied in the pre-symptomatic AD.
We hypothesized that CSA system measurements combine to provide robust biomarkers for pre-symptomatic
AD. Analogous to the stress test to unmask coronary insufficiency, our cognitive challenge revealed CH-PATs
had frontal hyper-activities with low load challenge and insufficient cognitive resources with high load
challenges, hyperresponsivity to subliminal interference, and hyperactive autonomic regulation. Further,
combined CSA biomarkers improve detection of pre-symptomatic AD. Therefore, we hypothesize that neural
oscillations during cognitive challenge will reveal altered executive functions in pre-symptomatic AD,
correlate with compromised subliminal processing and autonomic nervous function, and their
combination will improve detection and prediction of pre-symptomatic AD.
Our Specific Aims will test our hypothesis in a new cohort and test the ability of CSA biomarkers to identify CH-
PATs and predict decline in a 2-year longitudinal study. Accomplishing this CSA approach will provide multiple
novel translational biomarkers to characterize pre-symptomatic AD. These biomarkers are non-invasive,
benchmarked to established CSF biomarkers. Our research addresses an important gap in pre-symptomatic
AD detection and prediction of AD symptom onset."

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a phlebovirus that belongs to the Phenuiviridae (formerly Bunyaviridae) family
of negative-sense RNA viruses. As an emerging mosquito-borne virus, the significance of RVFV is highlighted
by its designation as a NIAID Category A pathogen and its inclusion on the WHO's Blueprint of Priority Diseases.
Recently, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has also included RVFV as a part of their
emerging infectious diseases vaccine program, further emphasizing the potential impact of RVFV on the global
health and economy. While RVFV is endemic throughout sub-Saharan Africa, competent mosquito vector
species are found in North America, highlighting the potential for emergence of RVFV in non-endemic countries,
including the United States. During outbreaks, RVFV causes severe disease in livestock, including sheep and
cattle, which dramatically impact the socioeconomic framework in resource limited settings. Humans are spill-
over hosts, where infections can result in severe consequences, including hepatic necrosis, hemorrhagic fever,
encephalitis, and retinal vasculitis. Despite its significance to human health and the potential to negatively impact
the socioeconomic fabric of resource-limited countries where the virus is endemic, there is a lack of safe and
efficacious prophylactic and therapeutic treatment options. This gap is in part due to our lack of knowledge on
host factors that contribute to RVFV infection. To address this need, we conducted a genomic screen that defined
several critical factors, including a potential entry factor, which we will characterize by a multidisciplinary
approach. In support, we provide compelling preliminary data, including in vitro validation in host factor sufficient
and deficient cells, transcomplementation studies, direct interaction between RVFV glycoprotein Gn and the host
proteins in vitro, inhibition of the entry factor by endogenous ligands in vitro in multiple cell lines from
evolutionarily distinct hosts, and preliminary results of protection from RVFV infection in two conditional knock
out mouse models. Importantly, we have generated many key reagents, including most cell lines and proteins,
and knock-out mice supporting the feasibility. Importantly, this work will be performed by highly productive and
collaborative investigators with expertise in every aspect of the proposed studies, including biochemistry, RVFV
pathogenesis, immunology, proteomics, structural biology, and virology. Completion of the proposed studies will
define novel host or entry factors for RVFV in target cells with tissue-specific relevance. As a specific receptor
for RVFV has not previously been identified, these studies will provide important information for design of
therapeutic interventions to prevent RVFV infection and disease. At the completion, we expect to fill a key gap
in the field and to provide novel targets for therapeutic development."
10764272,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a wide-spread pathogen, infecting the majority of the population in the United States. This virus poses a significant threat to developing fetuses as well as to children and adults who lack a competent immune system, often causing severe disease and mortality. Once individuals acquire an HCMV infection, the virus remains with the host for life, in a latent or quiescent state in the hematopoietic compartment. During times of severe immunological stress, the virus reactivates to its active state, allowing for dissemination and subsequent disease. With the exception of the immuno-naïve and sero-negative organ transplant recipients, primary infection with HCMV rarely causes disease, but rather it is reactivation that leads to significant complications. Thus, to prevent HCMV-associated disease, we must gain a complete understanding of viral latency and reactivation. During latency, HCMV encodes three of the four viral G protein-coupled receptors (vGPCRs): US28, UL33, and UL78. We previously showed US28-mediated signaling is required for establishing and maintaining latency and modulates the expression of specific cellular targets that regulate the Major Immediate Early (MIE) locus, a master regulator in the latent-to-lytic switch. Our findings also reveal a requirement for UL33 and UL78 for efficient viral reactivation from latency. Therefore, we hypothesize the vGPCRs modulate specific host signaling pathways to regulate the balance between latency and reactivation. To explore this hypothesis, we will take advantage of novel approaches coupled with our arsenal of viral recombinants, as well as both in vitro and ex vivo latency model systems. In Aim 1, we will define mechanisms underlying US28-mediated signaling and how this impacts the recruitment of silencing factors to the MIE locus during latency. In Aim 2, we will determine how UL33 signaling impacts the transactivation of the MIE locus and subsequent reactivation, as well as delineate how the interaction between US28 and UL78 tips the balance from latent-to-lytic replication. In sum, the experiments proposed herein will lead to a greater understanding of the vGPCRs’ biological functions during latency and reactivation, laying the foundation for future studies to develop novel therapeutics to prevent HCMV reactivation and disease."

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) caused by Aspergillus fumigatus is characterized by uncontrolled filamentous hyphal
growth deep into host tissues and is a fatal disease of immunocompromised patients with mortality rates as high
as 90%. This high mortality rate indicates the critical need for improved antifungal therapeutic strategies. We
have uncovered a bidirectional lipid signaling system between the fungus and host that mediates invasive hyphal
growth and phagocyte activation. Based on strong preliminary data, this communication system consists of
structurally similar fungal and host ligands (e.g. oxylipins) that are recognized by specific fungal and host G
protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The fungal and host oxylipins work in opposition to regulate fungal growth
and leukocyte functionality. We hypothesize that fungal and host oxylipins are cross-Kingdom molecular analogs
that signal through specific GPCR cascades, inducing penetrating hyphal growth and manipulating host defense
responses to drive IA progression. Our data not only provide new insight into how eukaryotic pathogens and
their hosts communicate with one another directly during disease but also provide a new foundation for
experimental approaches to decipher, manipulate, and control this communication system in favor of the host.
Accordingly, we will (1) Identify the oxylipins and their transcriptional cascades that regulate invasive
branching growth and (2) Characterize the receptors by which fungus and host recognize each other’s
oxylipins and the consequences of this recognition. GPCR are particularly propitious targets for therapeutic
design (40% of current pharmaceuticals target GPCR). Thus, upon completion of this work, we anticipate that
we will have delineated a new fungal-host ligand-receptor communication language amenable to therapeutic
intervention to inhibit filamentous invasive growth during human disease."

Trauma impacts the life of nearly every individual and plays a pivotal role in shaping our mental health, leaving
individuals vulnerable to an array of debilitating psychological conditions, including post-traumatic stress
disorder, substance use disorders, anxiety, and depression. Much trauma research has focused on how
memories for traumatic events are formed, with considerably less emphasis on the multifaceted processes
contributing to these conditions. Further highlighting the importance of examining multiple trauma endpoints,
growing evidence indicates that the consequences of trauma are behaviorally and biologically dissociable.
Thus, the diverse pathological consequences of trauma may require individualized treatment targets. The
experiments in this proposal will utilize a behavioral procedure that will allow the diverse consequences of
trauma to be simultaneously studied in mice, combined with a sophisticated set of techniques for isolating
biological variance, allowing for the disentanglement of their biological origins. Under the K99 portion of this
proposal – to be completed at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai under the mentorship of Drs.
Denise Cai (primary mentor), Ian Maze (co-mentor), and Scott Russo (co-mentor) – I will first test the
hypothesis that trauma induces lasting changes in amygdala trauma ensembles (i.e., neurons active in
response to trauma) that results in enhanced responses to subsequent stressors, but not other anxiety-like
phenotypes. This will be achieved using a combination of in vivo calcium imaging and selective optogenetic
inhibition of trauma ensembles during subsequent behavioral tests. Further, I will use RNA sequencing of
trauma ensembles to determine the transcriptional changes specific to these cells, in hopes of discovering
novel targets for intervention. Technical training under the K99 portion will include optogenetics, fluorescence
activated nuclear sorting, and transcriptomic analyses. Additionally, I will receive vital career development
training on topics related to laboratory and personnel management, grant writing, communication/networking,
and entering a tenure track position at a top-tier academic research institution. Under the R00 portion of this
proposal, I will utilize a similar set of techniques to test the hypothesis that ventral hippocampal trauma
ensembles support persistent anxiety-like behaviors after trauma. This work will provide both key insights into
how trauma persistently influences anxiety-like behavior and robust preliminary data for my lab’s first grant
applications. The training and support provided by this award will be instrumental as I establish a successful
career focused on how trauma predisposes individuals to neuropsychiatric illness."

 “Evolutionary innovation” refers to the origin of entirely new traits, as opposed to the modification of
existing traits. Although such novelties are relatively rare, all the complexity and diversity of life have
ultimately been shaped by evolutionary innovations that occurred in a nested pattern, with every innovation
dependent on many earlier novelties. Despite their critical importance for everything from geological
nutrient cycles that support all life on Earth to human sentience that distinguishes us from our closest
relatives, the molecular mechanisms of evolutionary innovations are understood far less than the evolution
of existing traits. This is true at all levels of biological organization, from single molecules to the most
complex features of animal form and function. We understand the evolution of existing organs and cell
types better than the origin of new ones; quantitative variation in gene expression has been explored in
greater detail than the origin of new regulatory pathways; much more is known about the evolution of
existing genes than about the origin of new genes, and so on. It is this gap in knowledge that motivates our
work.
 To achieve a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary innovations, it is necessary to connect
novelties at all levels of biological organization: from new functional elements in the genome, to new genetic
pathways, to new morphological structures. Research in our lab will advance in several directions, using
the Drosophila model system. First, we will identify the key DNA sequence changes responsible for the
origin of a new morphological structure that evolved recently in Drosophila. Second, we will characterize
the cell differentiation pathway that translates these changes into novel morphologies and reconstruct how
this pathway was assembled in the course of evolution. Third, we will look more broadly at how ancestral
genes acquire new expression patterns. We will test whether cooption of old genes into new tissues
involves modification of existing regulatory sequences or the origin of new regulatory elements. Finally, we
will reconstruct the origin of new regulatory elements from non-functional ancestral sequences. By focusing
on new genes that evolved within natural populations of a single species, we will identify the series of
mutations that create new regulatory elements in the genome. Together, these approaches will promote a
deep mechanistic understanding of evolutionary innovations."
10768579,"Project Summary/Abstract: Investigating the molecular etiology of disorders caused by disturbed mineral
metabolism has been instrumental in identifying new circulating regulators of phosphate homeostasis. We
identified Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) in a positional cloning approach to isolate the gene
responsible for autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), characterized by
hypophosphatemia secondary to renal phosphate wasting, rickets/osteomalacia, and fracture. The FGF23
co-receptor alpha-Klotho (KL), acting in a heteromeric complex with a canonical FGF receptor (FGFR), is
required for normal phosphate metabolism. This is emphasized by the fact that KL loss of function
mutations lead to end-organ FGF23 resistance, and cause the phenotypic reciprocal disorder to ADHR,
hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (hfTC). In a similar manner, patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) demonstrate impaired FGF23-responsiveness due to a loss of functional kidney mass and
reduced Klotho expression, leading to increased serum phosphate concentrations and further increases in
FGF23 production. KL is expressed as a membrane-bound protein (`mKL') that mediates FGF23-dependent
signaling in target tissues, as well as a major circulating species that originates from the proteolytic
cleavage of mKL within its juxta-extracellular membrane domain to derive a soluble form or `sKL'. Although
the recent solving of the FGF23-sKL-FGFR1 triple crystal structure revealed insight into static sKL-FGF23
interactions, the complete scope of mKL versus sKL biological functions in the control of FGF23 and mineral
metabolism remains unclear due to a lack of appropriate in vivo models. Our initial studies in mice with
genetically reduced sKL expression showed aberrant FGF23 production in response to dietary phosphate
challenges. Unlike global KL-KO mice, this model has the advantage of a lifespan that allows extended
studies, providing new opportunities to gain critical insight into the regulation of FGF23 bioactivity in chronic
conditions. Collectively, our results support mechanistic aims to identify specific sKL-FGF23 interactions in
the control of phosphate metabolism, as well as to test sKL as a translational target in the treatment of
human disorders. The central hypothesis to be tested in this proposal is: the sKL form of Klotho is required
for normal FGF23-mediated phosphate handling and is protective during renal disease. We expect our
studies using dovetailed, cutting-edge in vivo and in vitro techniques to provide novel, translational insight
into the basic biology of phosphate metabolism, as well as into both rare and common syndromes of altered
Klotho and FGF23 expression."

Herpesviruses are endemic within the human population, and cause a wide range of life-threatening diseases.
Members of the betaherpesvirus and gammaherpesvirus subfamilies are extremely problematic in
immunocompromised individuals, leading to severe congenital disorders and a variety of cancers. This
proposal will define how a critical class of herpesviral genes are expressed late in the lifecycle of Kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) through a mechanism that involves a novel transcription complex,
which combines both viral mimicry and co-option of select host machinery. The set of viral proteins required for
late gene activation are broadly conserved among the beta- and gammaherpesviruses, indicating that
information gained herein for KSHV will likely be applicable for Epstein-Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus
as well. The focus of this grant is to define the composition and regulation of this novel gene expression
complex, and reveal how its function is linked to viral genome replication. Given that even subtle mutations in
this late gene transcription complex effectively `kill' the virus, an understanding of its composition and
regulation is anticipated to reveal new targets for antiviral strategies."

The COVID-19 pandemic arrived at a time when U.S. birth rates had been declining for several years. Contrary
to initial predictions of a “COVID baby boom,” early evidence shows that the pandemic coincided with a steeper
decline in birth rates.
But fertility patterns vary dramatically across the U.S., and the mortality and health effects of COVID-19 have
also varied by location, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Therefore, we expect significant variation in
the pandemic’s effect on fertility. However, currently available data make this difficult to study - fertility rates by
household income are not available in the U.S., even at the national level, nor are rate schedules by combinations
of race/ethnicity and income or parity. This project seeks to leverage a new restricted data source, which our
team has produced under the NICHD-funded ""Increased access to contraception: an opportunity dividend?""
project (R01-HD101480-01, 2020-2024), to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility.
In partnership with the U.S. Census Bureau, we will use a dataset we created, Reproduction in People’s Lives
(RIPL), which provides the full count individual-level longitudinal data needed to study how changes in fertility
during the COVID-19 pandemic have varied by age, state, race and ethnicity, household income, and birth order.
Using this dataset, we will link multiple U.S. administrative data sources, including individual tax filings microdata,
the 2010 decennial Census, and social security data, to (Aim 1) calculate age-specific fertility rates for all U.S.
women by state and demographic subgroup for the years 2015 through 2021. These rates - calculated by
race/ethnicity, household income, parity, and most combinations of these characteristics - represent a significant
improvement in level of detail over current publicly available rates.
Using the rates calculated for the pre-pandemic period (2015-2019) we will (Aim 2) use demographic forecasting
to generate counterfactual rates that represent estimated 2020-2021 fertility levels by state and demographic
subgroup in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use a forecasting method that is demonstrated to
perform well over the short- to medium-term in fertility contexts like the contemporary U.S. and which is based
on the Lee-Carter method, a cornerstone of demographic forecasting.
We will (Aim 3) assess heterogeneity in the COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on fertility by comparing these
counterfactuals to the observed rates constructed under Aim 1 during the years 2020-2021. The forecast
counterfactuals allow us to estimate the portion of fertility change over the pandemic period that is the result of
the pandemic, and to compare this portion across different age groups, sociodemographic subgroups, parities,
and states. We anticipate that we will also be able to publicly release a subset of the rate schedules and forecasts
we generate, allowing other researchers access to this important new data source."

Sexual minorities (i.e., individuals who do not identify as heterosexual, or who are attracted to, have romantic
relationships with, or have sexual contact with, people of the same or diverse genders) in the US are at a two
to seven-fold increased risk for lifetime report of suicide attempts and a near three-fold increased odds for
depression. Sexual minority stigma exposure, in its various forms, has been purported as a cause underlying
and driving these sexual orientation-based disparities in mental health. While structural forms of sexual
minority stigma, including discriminatory laws, inequitable policies, and negative population attitudes, have
been associated with adverse sexual minority mental health in cross-sectional designs, no longitudinal studies
to date have examined three key elements needed to establish causality, including 1) temporality with the
exposure preceding the effect, 2) dose-response gradient comprehensively assessed across the life course,
and 3) specificity of results with the exposure explaining an observed disparity in outcomes. With data
collected during a transformational period for sexual minorities in the US (from 2001 to 2018 with, e.g.,
changes in population attitudes and the step-wise introduction of same-gender marriage), the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) provides a unique and timely opportunity to
longitudinally examine the effect of life-course structural stigma exposure on sexual minorities’ mental health
and the three missing causality requirements. Therefore, this proposed study will 1) quantify the level of
structural sexual minority stigma for each US state between 2001 and 2018 and calculate individuals’ exposure
over time, 2) examine the associations between structural sexual minority stigma and suicidal ideation, suicide
attempts, and depressive symptoms in longitudinal models, and 3) examine if the associations between
structural sexual minority stigma and mental health outcomes in longitudinal models vary by sexual orientation.
The proposed study will employ advanced three-level multi-membership longitudinal models to account for
lifetime-varying exposure and between-state migration. Findings from the proposed study may have direct
theoretical and applied implications as it addresses important causality issues on how structural sexual
minority stigma shapes sexual minorities’ mental health. Results may further contribute to health equity by
facilitating targeted advocacy to improve structural climates for sexual minorities, not only in the US, but
similarly across the globe."

Sleep and memory dysfunction are key features across many psychiatric disorders. Patients with schizophrenia
commonly display both decreased sleep spindles and memory consolidation deficits. In comparison, people
suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder have sleep disruption and nightmares associated with heightened
fear memories. A growing number of studies support the theory that infrequently used dendritic spines are
pruned during sleep, thus improving memories by enhancing the signal to noise ratio of frequently reinforced
synaptic connections. Our published and preliminary data demonstrates that dendritic spines in neurons that
encoded a recent contextual fear memory trace are upscaled during sleep in the presence of broad
downscaling. Furthermore, our data pointing to broad upscaling of dendritic spines in the amygdala during sleep
compared to broad downscaling in the hippocampus indicates that synapses in two key areas of the emotional
memory circuit are differentially regulated. There is a critical knowledge gap regarding the molecular pathways
involved in dendritic spine upscaling and downscaling during sleep. The proposed studies will use a
combination of state-of-the-art single nucleus RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and targeted mass
spectrometry along with a novel transgenic mouse model, and complementary human brain postmortem
studies, to create a much-needed foundation of molecular signaling pathways involved in upscaling and
downscaling of synapses in the fear memory circuit during sleep and identify new molecules involved in this
process. Thus, the aims of this proposal will significantly leverage the expertise and technological capabilities
uniquely offered through the Molecular Center of Health and Disease- COBRE. The expected data will serve
as a foundation for future studies examining disruption of these pathways in psychiatric disorders, and studies
designed to identify novel targets for therapeutic strategies."
10791736,"Project Summary
This project pursues two research directions that build on two NIGMS funded research programs. Both
projects are loosely connected and the pathways studied will help understand how metabolic and
environmental cues are sensed and transmitted to the cell cycle machinery. Previous work in yeast models
has established different ubiquitin-mediated signaling events that communicate metabolic and
environmental states to the cell cycle machinery. Molecular understanding of the concepts that govern
ubiquitin signaling are thus the topic of the first part of this application. Project-1 studies both yeast and
mammalian cell line models to define general concepts of ubiquitin signaling. These experiments build on
a plethora of tools we have developed to analyze biochemistry and physiology of ubiquitin signaling and
will address the following questions: (1) How do readers of the ubiquitin signal distinguish different chain
types? (2) How do F-box proteins sense metabolic and environmental states? (3) How do ubiquitin ligases
recognize substrates in a context specific manner? (4) How is signaling achieved by phosphorylated
ubiquitin. Proposed work in project 1 will define detailed molecular insight in aspects of ubiquitin signaling
both proteolytic and non-proteolytic.
Project-2 is focused on the mammalian system, were we discovered important connectors between
methionine metabolism and cell proliferation. These include regulation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
and RNA CAP methylation of selected transcripts. Work on PP2A in mammalian cells will focus on the role
of methylation of the carboxy terminus of the catalytic subunit of PP2A as a sensor of methionine
metabolism. Experiments will expand on proteomic profiling that identified several PP2A interaction
partners with preference for the demethylated PP2A complex. We will dissect these interactions and define
their role in communicating metabolic states to the cell cycle machinery. Studies related to mRNA CAP
methylation will extend our recent findings that a small group of RNAs is highly sensitive to subtle
fluctuations in the cellular methylation potential, which is controlled by methionine metabolism. These
RNAs become hypomethylated on their mRNA CAPs, and thus are inefficiently translated when methionine
is limiting. The goal is to understand mechanisms that make certain mRNAs hypersensitive to fluctuation
in methionine metabolism, and to discover the mechanistic link to cell cycle control.
Understanding the molecular concepts that integrate methionine metabolism with cell proliferation promise
new therapeutic strategies, especially for the treatment of cancer and other age-related disorders. Thus,
this proposal aims to development molecular insight into a fundamental, so far molecularly unexplored,
biological process with great therapeutic potential."
10784680,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Collective migration of epithelial cells plays central roles in morphogenesis, intestinal turnover, wound repair,
and metastasis. Epithelial cells use the same migration machinery as individual cells. For an epithelial sheet to
migrate, however, this machinery must become globally aligned across the tissue plane. Determining how this
tissue-level polarization is achieved is a central goal of the collective migration field. We study a rotational form
of epithelial migration that occurs when the tissue is confined to a circular or spherical geometry. Rotational
migrations differ from other epithelial migrations in two ways. First, external cues like empty space or chemo-
tactic signals are not available to guide tissue polarization. Instead, the cells must rely solely on local cell-cell
interactions to achieve this state. How cells self-organize for rotational migration is unknown. Second, there is
no net tissue movement, which raises the question of why these migrations occur. Rotation promotes the
assembly of the basement membrane extracellular matrix that lines the tissue’s basal surface; it can even
create highly structured basement membranes that direct organ morphogenesis. However, how rotation
impacts basement membrane assembly is poorly understood. Notably, recent work has shown that epithelial
rotation may contribute to human organ development, as the spherical alveoli of mammary organoids rotate as
they form despite being connected to a central ductwork.
My NIGMS-funded research has two goals: (1) to define the local cell-cell interactions that allow epithelial cells
self-organize for rotational migration, and (2) to determine how rotation structures the basement membrane.
To this end, we are studying a rotational migration that occurs in the follicular epithelium of the Drosophila. In
recent years, we used this model to provide the first insight into the local cell-cell interactions that polarize an
epithelium for rotational migration by identifying a novel planar signaling system that mediates this process. We
also showed that rotation works with new protein secretion to create fibrils in the basement membrane that
control tissue shape. Through the MIRA program, we will dig deeper into both mechanisms. We will determine
how the planar signaling system allows the follicle cells to break symmetry and initiate migration and how the
signaling works at molecular level - both in terms of how the proteins interact with one another and with the
migration machinery. We will also explore two mechanisms by which mechanical forces imparted by rotational
migration are likely to influence basement membrane assembly. This work will reveal new guiding principles for
how tissue-level order can emerge from local cell-cell interactions. Moreover, because basement membranes
are central to most organs and defects in their assembly underly muscular dystrophy, nephropathy, skin
blistering, and stroke, anything we learn about this poorly understood process will have broad impact."
10834008,"While inﬂammation is a natural immune system response that begins the healing process, chronic inﬂam-
mation is tied to many human diseases including cancer, cardiac dysfunction, and sepsis. A key element of
inﬂammatory responses are macrophages, a white blood cell that eliminates pathogens or dying tissues. An
endogenous 'danger signal', adenosine triphosphate (ATP), stimulates Ca-dependent inﬂammatory pathways in
macrophages. While previous research has made great strides in understanding inﬂammation, my lab seeks to
uncover roles of ATP in driving macrophage inﬂammatory responses through multi-scale computational models
we develop. With new models of inﬂammatory responses in macrophages, our lab can predict protein and cell
behavior in integrated, physiological systems to better understand the immune system.
 The current paradigm for ATP-triggered inﬂammation in macrophages is that upregulation of nucleotide-
sensing P2X channels sensitizes inﬂammatory responses, including cytokine and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
release. However, this paradigm does not account for several observations. One, while P2X expression is
increased in inﬂammatory macrophages, these receptors also support phagocytosis and migration in resting
macrophages. How these processes are selectively controlled by P2X subtypes like P2X4 and P2X7 is unresolved.
Two, inﬂammatory macrophages harbor post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs) of many proteins that sense Ca,
yet little is known about how PTMs impact immune pathways they control. Three, release and degradation of ATP
by pannexins and ectonucleotidases control ATP that activates P2X, yet few studies have evaluated their coupling.
 Our lab is uniquely positioned to extend this paradigm by probing mechanisms underlying these observations
and the largely unstudied coupling of P2X-, ATP-, and Ca-driven inﬂammation. Our lab and assembled collab-
orators will investigate the overall hypothesis via computational modeling and experimental approaches: P2X
channels in macrophages help nucleate chronic inﬂammation via ATP-induced ATP release (autocrinic)
mechanisms that selectively prime Ca-dependent, pro-inﬂammatory signaling pathways. This hypothesis
stems from questions that emerged from our investigations during the initial ESI MIRA award: 1. Does increased
P2X4 and P2X7 expression and the resulting Ca signals they induce in macrophages prolong pro-inﬂammatory
release of cytokines and ROS? 2. Do PTMs like ROS oxidation in the Ca-sensor calmodulin (CaM) attenuate its
activation of pro-inﬂammatory signaling pathways? 3. Do (autocrinic) ATP-induced, ATP release in macrophages
prolong pro-inﬂammatory increases in intracellular Ca?
 Our long-term goal to understand macrophage physiology through computation will be accelerated
by the proposed investigations. Key expected outcomes from this grant period include new mechanisms and
simulation tools for autocrinic, ATP-driven inﬂammatory responses mediated by P2X receptors. Since all
Eukaryotic cells use Ca, insights from modeling macrophages will have broad impacts beyond immune function."
10766189,"Project Summary/Abstract
Our overall research program aims to understand how chemical diversity arises in living organisms, and to
apply that diversity to important biomedical problems. This MIRA project focuses on two related scientific
areas: 1) a hypothesis-based approach to discovering new biosynthetic pathways and biomedically important
compounds from marine animals; and 2) understanding diversity-generating biosynthesis and applying it to
synthetic biology. The program synergizes with our applied biomedical research in drug discovery and
development, which is funded elsewhere. Because so much remains to be learned about how nature produces
diverse chemical scaffolds, our MIRA program is the key to providing innovative new materials and methods
that underlie the biomedical applications. We address two overarching problems:
1) There is a greater variety of animal life in the sea than anywhere else, including millions of diverse animal
species. Many marine animals live in highly competitive environments, and therefore they or their symbiotic
bacteria synthesize small molecule chemical defenses, which have found value as FDA-approved therapeutics
and lead compounds. They contain chemical scaffolds found only in the oceans and nowhere else on Earth.
Although many important marine animal natural products have been discovered, the biological and chemical
diversity of the oceans has barely been touched. Most marine animals are simply too small, rare, or variable to
provide a sufficient supply of compounds for drug discovery and development. In research that will continue
through this program, we eliminate the barriers to discovering new potential pharmaceuticals, enzymes, and
biochemical pathways from animals. We take a hypothesis-driven approach to determine who makes marine
natural products (animal, symbiont, or other) and how the compounds are made biochemically. This activity
leads directly to the discovery and development of novel chemicals and potential pharmaceuticals in the
applied (non-MIRA) side of our laboratory.
2) Instead of containing a single bioactive natural product, species of animals contain families of compounds,
where individual animals harbor variants of a parent structure. Sometimes, thousands of variants arise from a
single biochemical scaffold. Underlying this chemical diversity, we have shown that several biosynthetic
pathways are diversity generating, capable of synthesizing millions of derivatives. This unusual plasticity has
been applied as a tool for synthetic biology. Among other applications, one of the most exciting is the ability to
design compounds and then produce them in different kinds of living cells. For example, genetic libraries
encoding millions of unnatural natural products have already been created, and we are developing cell-based
therapies. Here, using hypothesis testing, we ask how diversity-generating pathways function: what makes a
pathway plastic, and how can these features be used in rational synthetic biology approaches. We apply the
resulting discoveries to biomedical problems in the non-MIRA, applied biomedical side of our laboratory."
10770361,"Essential tremor (ET) is a chronic and progressive neurological disease affecting 7 million individuals in the
US, making it the most common tremor disorder. Despite being so prevalent, its underlying patho-mechanisms
remain enigmatic. In 2003, we established the Essential Tremor Centralized Brain Repository. Meticulous
clinical phenotyping of brain donors is followed by brain harvest and rigorous postmortem characterization.
Through this mechanism, we have harvested 217 ET brains, representing by far the largest collection of ET
brains in the world. Through detailed, systematic, controlled postmortem studies, we have learned that the
major postmortem changes in ET lie in the cerebellum, centered in/around Purkinje cells. Yet, in fundamental
ways, our studies have only grazed the surface. Indeed, our studies have sampled only one parasagittal region
of the cerebellar cortex. As an organ, the cerebellum is not a unitary entity; it is heterogeneous and comprised
of well-defined anatomic and functional compartments, which are differentially involved across various disease
states. We have yet to map out the degenerative pattern seen in the ET cerebellum (Aim 1). The current
disease model is also very cerebellar-centric, and one must consider whether the problem is wider. Indeed,
there is a “tremor circuit”, the cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loop and olivo-cerebellar (OC) networks,
comprising highly organized connections between the cerebellum, deep brain structures and the motor cortex,
and between cerebellum and inferior olive; these networks have been posited to be involved in the origins and
propagation of tremor in ET. Whether the postmortem changes in ET are distributed across and/or differentially
affects these physiological networks is not known (Aim 2). Studies of ET must also move from the level of
cellular changes down to molecular events. To begin to define the molecular features of ET, over the past
several years we have explored the molecular transcriptome in ET cerebellum by RNA sequencing, which
identified dysregulation in four main biologic pathways. Thus, to complement our studies of the transcriptome,
we now propose a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach, and partnering this with laser capture
microdissection (LCM) to target distinct neuronal populations in the tremor circuit. The creation of proteome
catalogs, comparing cases to matched controls, will uncover molecular events specifically associated with
disease (Aim 3). The proposed five-year study has three aims. AIM 1: To create a granular and refined map of
ET cerebellar neuropathology. We will determine whether and in what pattern the degenerative changes we
have documented in one region of the neocerebellum extend to other functional/anatomic cerebellar regions.
AIM 2: To determine whether the degenerative changes in ET are restricted to the cerebellum or more broadly
involve other structures in the CTC loop and OC loop. AIM 3: To use a mass spectrometry-based proteomic
approach to study protein expression in ET in an unbiased manner. We will analyze whole cerebellar cortex
tissue and partner this with LCM to target Purkinje cells as well as neurons in dentate and inferior olive nuclei."
10771135,"Abstract
Breast cancer (BC) brain/central nervous system (CNS) metastasis is associated with poor survival among U.S.
women, with 30-40% of these cases reported as triple receptor-negative (TN) and epidermal growth factor
receptor-positive (ErbB2+) BC subtypes. Despite the progress in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of
BC, there is still a significant increase in brain metastasis (BM) cases, and the survival rate among these BCBM
patients is very bleak. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify primary molecular drivers of BCBM and
novel predictive biomarker(s) for the early detection of BM. In this regard, our global transcriptomic analysis
showed that levels of a secretory gel-forming mucin, MUC5AC, is significantly higher in the brain tropic (BT) cells
than the parental BC cells. Additionally, an in silico analysis revealed significantly higher levels of MUC5AC in
the archived BCBM tissues compared to the primary tumors. Most importantly, the augmented levels of MUC5AC
were detected in the serum of BCBM patients compared to non-BM BC patients. These studies strongly suggest
that MUC5AC could be a potential predictive biomarker for the early detection of BCBM. Furthermore, MUC5AC
knockdown (KD) resulted in reduced motility, cell adhesion, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) transmigration in BT
cell lines relative to controls. Importantly, MUC5AC KD cells showed diminished BM potential in an intracardiac
mouse model. Our initial mechanistic studies on the MUC5AC-mediated BM showed an important role of the
CD44 and cMET pathways in BT cells. MUC5AC interacted with CD44v6, a co-receptor for cMET, and co-
localized with the activated form of cMET to establish BCBM. CD44v6 and cMET have been shown to
preferentially enhance BM through a feed-forward loop using hyaluronic acid and hepatocyte growth factor
pathways. We also observed robust expression of MUC5AC in BT cells in the presence of microglia/astrocyte
conditioned media. Targeting MUC5AC with PLB-1001 reduces MUC5AC expression in BT cells. We
hypothesize that “MUC5AC enhances BCBM through CD44v6/cMET-axis” and could thus be a useful marker to
predict BCBM. In Aim 1, we will establish MUC5AC as a novel predictive biomarker for BM in high-risk BC
patients, and examine whether high MUC5AC expression in primary tumors predicts BM, and correlates with
response to therapy, overall survival, and relapse. Aim 2 studies will define the regulation of MUC5AC-mediated
BM through the cMET/CD44v6/NF-κB-axis using preclinical mouse models. In Aim 3, we will use a BBB
penetrable phase 1 tested cMET inhibitor alone or in combination with cisplatin or neratinib as novel therapeutic
strategy for TN and ErbB2+ brain metastatic BC. Altogether, the proposed studies will establish MUC5AC as a
novel predictive biomarker for high-risk BM and will help in developing preventive strategies for BCBM, which
currently has no cure."

The Health for Hearts United Collaborative
Project Summary
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, and disproportionately affects
African Americans (AAs) who have the highest rates for CVD-related morbidity and mortality in comparison to
other ethnic/racial groups. Risk factors for these high CVD rates are related to a variety of factors, including
lifestyle. Church-based interventions have been shown to be effective in improving physical health outcomes of
AAs. However, a critical barrier to advancing the science of church-based health is understanding the most
effective strategies and the extent to which evidence-based health programs can be implemented and
maintained by churches themselves The Health for Hearts United Collaborative (HHUC), a community-
academic partnership comprised of 45 churches in collaboration with a broader multi-county health coalition,
was established after two successful intervention studies to reduce CVD risk in AAs in a two-county area of North
Florida, using community-based participatory research approaches. We now seek to use this collaborative
environment to investigate implementation of this intervention by the churches themselves as we expand the
HHUC. Thus, the proposed project will determine the effectiveness of HHUC implementation strategies
in relation to process outcomes and reducing CVD risk in AAs, guided by ecological theory, the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), and the RE-AIM framework, and using a two-
phase approach. The HHUC model currently includes three components: governance structure, annual events,
and basic support. Based on observed successes in selected HHUC churches, we propose adding a fourth
component that includes one of two possible implementation strategies: 1) an internal champions (IC)-driven
strategy that includes two features (leadership development, culturally-tailored planning approaches) or 2) an
external change agent (external professionals [EP])-driven strategy without these features. In Phase 1, we will
pilot and refine the IC and EP-driven implementation strategies using health leaders from four churches in
the two-county area by determining feasibility and acceptability. In Phase 2, we will use an effectiveness-
implementation hybrid Type 3 design to evaluate the IC and EP implementation strategies in relation to
process outcomes (reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance); and individual health behaviors (food
choice, dietary quality, physical activity) and clinical outcomes (BMIs, girth circumferences, systolic and diastolic
blood pressure), using congregants ((>18, n=225) in nine churches in the two-county area: three IC treatment,
three EP treatment, and three comparison with delayed comparable activities. The findings from this study will
inform the expansion of the HHUC and the reduction of CVD risk in AAs, with implications for other communities
and regions in the U.S.

Predicting disease phenotypes from genotypes is a grand challenge in biology and personalized medicine. Our
long-term goal is to address this challenge using a combination of computational and experimental
approaches. Working towards this goal, we have developed and deployed a powerful evolutionary systems
approach to map the complex relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in
biomedically important protein super-families such as protein kinases. We have made important contributions
describing the unique modes of allosteric regulation in various protein kinases, deciphering the structural basis
of oncogenic activation in a subset of receptor tyrosine kinases, uncovering the regulation of pseudokinases,
and developing new tools and resources for addressing data integration challenges in the signaling field. We
propose to build on these impactful studies to answer key questions emanating from our ongoing studies such
as: What are the functions of pseudokinases, the catalytically-inert members of the kinome, and how can we
use pseudokinases to better predict and characterize non-catalytic functions of kinases? What are the
functions of conserved cysteine residues in regulatory sites of protein and small molecule kinases and are they
post-translationally modified in redox signaling and oxidative stress response that are causally associated with
age-related disorders? How can we enhance existing computational models for predicting genome-phenome
relationships using structural information, and can machine learning on structurally enhanced knowledge
graphs reveal new relationships between patient-derived mutations and disease phenotypes?
We propose to answer these questions using a variety of approaches including statistical mining of large
sequence datasets, molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, mass spectrometry, biochemical
analysis and in vivo assays. Completion of this work is expected to reveal new allosteric sites for targeting
pseudokinase and kinase non-catalytic functions in diseases, and significantly advance our understanding of
kinase regulatory mechanisms in disease and normal states. Our work will create new tools and resources for
knowledge graph mining and provide explainable models for inferring causal relationships linking genomes and
phenomes with potential applications in personalized medicine. Finally, the scope and impact of our work will
be significantly broadened by participation in studies extending our specialized tools and technological
approaches developed for the study of kinases to other biomedically important gene families such as
glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases."
10765615,"Project Summary
 Decision-making is critical for survival but is a complex process to understand at the level of brain function.
Animals and humans alike can use two strategies to solve problems of decision-making: goal-directed or habitual
behavior. Habits emerge late in training as animals transition from reliance on a goal-directed strategy to a habit
with experience. Biologically, habits are known to develop via communication between a network of areas that
span across the brain. Of particular interest for habit formation are the prefrontal cortex (IL), the sensorimotor
striatum (DLS), dopaminergic projections to the striatum (SNc), and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA).
Previous work has shown that a characteristic neuronal signature develops in IL and DLS, where as a habit
develops, single-unit neuronal activity accentuates the beginning and end of actions of the behavior as it
becomes well-learned. Importantly, as habits are comprised of multiple components (e.g. efficiency of action
sequences and insensitivity to goal value), these individual features correlate with neural activity in distinct brain
areas across the habit network (IL: outcome devaluation insensitivity, DLS: action vigor). However, there is a
gap in knowledge in how activity in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) codes habits or how that activity
relates to the function of these other interconnected areas
 The objective of this project is to define how neural activity in CeA contributes to habit formation and
whether a distinct component of behavior correlates with neural activity. The rationale is that the habit network
is conserved across mammals as habits are ubiquitous and the potential for basic research to translate into
bettering the human condition is high. The central hypothesis is that CeA neurons will develop a “chunking”
pattern of activity that is necessary for a habit to develop, with behavioral correlates of this neural activity similar
to those that correlate with IL. Guided by methods and data from Specific Aim 1, where behavioral phenotypes
of habit and methodology to test habit formation are addressed, Specific Aim 2 will, through in-vivo
electrophysiology, determine if CeA activity brackets in a manner similar to IL, DLS, and SNc as a habit forms
on an elevated plus-maze task. Specific Aim 3 details a plan to identify and pursue a postdoctoral research
fellowship upon completion of the dissertation work described in Specific Aim 2. Overall, the proposed
experiment has the potential to provide mental health clinicians and researchers significant insight into how
compulsive actions may arise from improperly timed amygdalar activity and will further define how neural activity
can contribute to psychological phenomena such as habit formation."

This is a resubmission of our T32 entitled “Training in Behavioral and Preventive Medicine” based at the
Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center (WCDRC) in affiliation with the Center of Behavioral and
Preventive Medicine (CBPM) at The Miriam Hospital and Brown University. During this next cycle, we plan to
train 15 postdoctoral fellows for two-year periods to conduct research to reduce the burden of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) by targeting the most prominent lifestyle risk factors, namely obesity, physical inactivity, and
smoking. Given the focus on behavior and the expertise of our mentors, we propose to primarily train PhDs.
Our success is highlighted by the fact that 13 of the 14 fellows who completed training in this recent cycle have
faculty appointments and 12 have support for their research. Prior fellows were equally successful. A goal for
this next cycle is to increase the number of fellows from underrepresented racial/ethnic minority groups.
This T32 trains researchers to develop and disseminate effective interventions targeting behaviors associated
with CVD risk. The approach requires multidisciplinary training facilitated by the ongoing collaborations
between the WCDRC, CBPM, Brown Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Department of Medicine,
and School of Public Health. Our focus continues to be on changing lifestyle risk factors. However, our training
continues to evolve with the science, and we now highlight 3 exciting new directions: the importance of
prevention and thus the need to consider early antecedents and early intervention; the use of new
methodologies to optimize and disseminate effective interventions; and improving treatments for underserved
and overburdened populations. We have extensive ongoing research in each of these areas. We have retained
and augmented our successful training model for this cycle. Program Director Rena Wing, PhD, continues in
her leadership capacity and Drs. Elissa Jelalian and John Graham Thomas are Associate Directors; they work
closely with the Executive Committee, all of whom have expertise in relevant research areas and in training of
postdoctoral fellows. Training is highly individualized with all fellows developing core competencies in CVD-
related behavioral research and specialized competencies in their specific areas of research through a
combination of formal didactics and mentored research experiences. Mentoring teams are headed by a
Primary Mentor, with expertise in behavioral medicine assessment and intervention who has prior experience
in mentoring and receives formal training in mentoring and cultural sensitivity. A secondary mentor is selected
with methodological expertise or content area (public health; cardiology, pediatrics) relevance to the specific
trainee. There is a formal evaluation of mentors, trainees, and the overall training program. We feel uniquely
qualified to continue our T32 research training in behavior change and CVD."

This proposal is in response to PAR19-093, and its aims are consistent with NIMHD and OBSSR priorities.
This research will examine how a unique health information technology (HIT) tool impacts patient and provider
outcomes when implemented in a pediatric primary care clinic serving a socioeconomically disadvantaged
population that is primarily Black/African American.
Aim 1. To test the impact of implementing a new EMR-based Infant Sleep Assessment (ISA) and brief
communication training on a) pediatric clinicians’ delivery of anticipatory guidance (both positive and
unintended negative consequences); and b) parents’ satisfaction with care, infant safe sleep knowledge,
beliefs, reported practices, and observed infant sleep environments.
Aim 2. To assess how implementing the new EMR-based ISA and brief communication training is perceived by
pediatric clinicians in terms of its advantages, disadvantages, and impact on their delivery of anticipatory
guidance.
 For Aim 1, a randomized controlled trial will compare outcomes between a Standard of Care (SOC) and an
ISA group. Each of 12 half-day clinic sessions will be randomly assigned to SOC or ISA. Clinicians (N=88) and
the parents of their newborn patients (N=188 per study group) will remain in their assigned group throughout
the study. The ISA group will complete the tool at their 2-month well-baby visit, and both groups will have this
visit audio recorded. Follow-up data will be collected by an in-home survey and observation when the infant is
3-4 months old. For Aim 2, a brief survey will be completed by the clinicians at the end of their study
participation. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, presentations and summary
briefs distributed through electronic media to the pediatric, injury prevention, public health, clinical informatics,
and health disparities communities."

experiencing sampling) have provided critical tests of theories about the development of alcohol use disorder
(AUD) by identifying within-person processes (such as negative or reinforcement, stress exposure, or social
context) that can raise the risk for problem drinking and in turn AUD. AA methods are the leading
methodological approach in the push towards personalized medicine because it provides a compelling platform
for assessment, diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and just-in-time interventions. However, the current utility of
AA for personalized models of AUD risk is limited because risky drinking and the risk factors for it (such as
changes in moods, stress, or social contexts) change at different scales of time. In other words, even heavy
drinkers may only drink a few times a week, but their emotions, stressors and social contexts change multiple
times a day. Current AA methods that rely on self-report data have to sample frequently enough to be sensitive
to change, long enough to observe sufficient drinking episodes, and to do so while avoiding participant
burnout. Passive mobile sensing, which uses sensors (such as GPS, accelerometer, light meter, etc.) available
on most smartphones, has been shown in preliminary studies to predict the probability of drinking episodes,
but those studies have used relatively small samples. The present career development award aims to develop
the candidate’s expertise in passive mobile sensing and the machine learning methods used to analyze
passive mobile sensing data. The research proposal will analyze passive mobile sensing data collected in a
large sample of regular drinking and marijuana using young adults (age 18 – 22, n = 500; 95.2% who drink),
who will be followed using AA over 8 successive weekends as part of a parent R01 (DA 047247). The research
goal is to identify passive mobile sensing models of risk factors for drinking (stress, social contexts, sleep,
mood, and impulsive states), as well as the drinking episodes themselves. The candidate will develop
expertise in these methods and models that will further the development of a research program aimed at
developing person specific models of risk for AUD."

Adolescents account for a disproportionately high percentage of new HIV infections each year: in 2018, 30% of
all new global infections were among 15-25 year-olds, and 21% of all new United States infections were among
13-24 years-olds 2-4. However, we know little about the effects of new infection and therapy on the developing
brain in this critical time frame. Limited studies on HIV+ 18-24 year-olds on and off antiretroviral therapy (ART)
demonstrate that up to 65% develop behavioral, cognitive and motor impairments meeting the criteria for HIV
associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) 5,6, a proportion higher than that seen in older HIV+ adult counterparts
despite lower viremia, higher CD4+ T-cell counts, and shorter durations of infection in adolescents 7. A major
gap in our knowledge is the mechanistic basis of this dysfunction in the developing central nervous
system (CNS). The effect of virus-mediated and/or ART toxicities on normal myelination and synaptic
pruning in the adolescent and young adult brain is unknown. It is well documented that functionally critical
development of white matter (WM) and synaptic plasticity continues until the mid-twenties in humans 8.
Interestingly, WM deficits, including myelin lesions, decreased myelin sheath thickness, and abnormal myelin
protein expression, are among the persistent pathologic findings in HIV+ adults with HAND 1,9-11 Consistent with
pathologic findings, transcriptome analyses of cortical gray matter (GM) and WM from HIV+ adults, both ART-
naïve and ART-treated, have revealed decreased expression of genes associated with oligodendrocyte (OL)
differentiation and myelination 12,13. We have shown HIV-associated neuroinflammation inhibits OL maturation
through upregulation of the integrated stress response (a pathway shown to be dysregulated in the CNS of HIV+
patients) 14,15. Further, data from our laboratory also suggest that a subset of ARV drugs themselves can disrupt
differentiation of OL precursor cells in vitro and remyelination in vivo 16-18. An independent effect of ARV drugs on
WM pathology is clinically important not only in the care of HIV+ adolescents, but also in uninfected adolescents
who use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors,
emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), to prevent HIV infection. Our preliminary data
indicate that several ARV drugs, including FTC and TDF, inhibit the progression of OL maturation in vitro through
lysosomal dysfunction suggesting a role for organellar stress. Thus, we hypothesize that HIV, ART and PrEP
disrupt developmental myelination via organellar stress contributing to the multifaceted CNS deficits
observed in adolescents and young adults. We propose to: 1) Determine the mechanisms by which HIV-
induced neuroinflammation disrupts OL maturation in adolescents, 2) Determine the role of lysosome dysfunction
in ART-induced changes in OL maturation in rodent models of adolescence and young adulthood, and 3)
Compare OL maturation and myelination measures in Aims 1 and 2 to magnetic resonance imaging measures
of WM volume and integrity in adolescent rats and a pre-existing cohort of adolescent humans."

10767179,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects ~1% of the population.
Progress has been made in elucidating the genetics of ASD through large-scale genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies that have identified several loci associated with
ASD. However, a substantial fraction of ASD status cannot be explained by genetic sequence variation. There
are multiple reasons to expect that DNA methylation (DNAm) may account for part of this unexplained
variation. First, part of the ASD-related genes identified via DNA sequence variation include genes involved in
chromatin modification and DNAm. Second, ASD likely originates during prenatal development, a period of
dynamically regulated changes in DNAm in the brain. As this remodeling may result in epimutations that can
dysregulate brain function, disruption of the DNAm regulation in utero represents a plausible ASD risk
mechanism. Third, ASD is associated with several neonatal and other environmental risk factors. Because
DNAm can be modified by environmental factors, it may mediate the effect of these risk factors on ASD.
 The overall aims of this project is to enhance our understanding of DNAm in ASD etiology, and use DNAm
marks at for early detection of individuals at risk for ASD. For this purpose we will generate methylome-wide
data using samples from ASD cases age 18-25 years and matched controls from an existing Swedish case-
control study called Population-based Autism Genetics and Environment Study. In addition, we will use stored
neonatal blood samples to generate a second methylation profile for these same individuals at birth. Thus, we
will have methylome-wide data from blood for two time-points from all participants, accompanied by
longitudinal phenotype information spanning birth to current date obtained from the Swedish registers.
 We will use a sequencing-based approach to assay the DNAm status of nearly all 28 million common CpG
sites in the human genome and will perform a battery of novel statistical analyses including methylome-wide
association studies (MWAS) of whole blood and individual cell-types in blood; analyses integrating DNAm
information with neonatal risk factors and already existing GWAS and WES data; and studies exploring the role
of DNAm in the ASD sex-bias. Significant findings will be replicated in four existing and independent blood
sample collections, and studied in the newly generated methylation/expression data from ASD brain samples.
Finally, we propose to use neonatal DNAm markers to create multi-marker methylation risk scores (MRSs) for
predicting ASD risk."

 Many studies, including analyses in this overall Program of research, have conducted genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) to identify genes and loci associated with complex disease. While a number of
genetic association signals have been uncovered, the challenge of identifying causative genes at these genetic
loci remains. As such, the goal of this Project is to move from GWAS association to identification of causal
effector genes relevant to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and excessive sleepiness, two key traits studied in this
Program. To fill this critical gap in evidence this Project combines state-of-the-art approaches in cell-based and
animal models. Analyses will begin by interrogating genetic loci from recent GWAS on OSA and sleepiness, and
be extended to evaluate loci from ongoing analyses, including those in Projects 01 and 03. In Aim 1, we will
conduct in silico physical `variant to gene mapping' based on our established Assay for Transposase Accessible
Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) plus genome-wide promotor-focused Capture C data on relevant cell types
- osteoblasts and adipocytes (for anatomy; relevant to Project 01) and neurons and primary astrocytes (for
sleepiness; relevant to Project 03). These 3D Genomics analyses will identify the most likely causal genes and
variants by determining which candidates at implicated loci directly interact with regions of open chromatin. After
identifying likely causal genes and variants, follow-up analyses in animal models will be performed to understand
if candidate effector genes act by affecting OSA-related anatomy in mice (Aim 2) and sleep behavior reflective
of sleepiness and disturbed sleep in Drosophila and zebrafish (Aim 3). Specifically, Aim 2 will utilize the novel
multivariate genotype-phenotype mapping pipeline we developed to identify causal genes affecting OSA risk
through effects on craniofacial shape and/or tongue fat. In applying this method, this Aim leverages both existing
and newly generated data in a large sample of Diversity Outbred mice with genetic data and anatomical traits
quantified via imaging. This cutting-edge approach facilitates determination of the effects of multiple genes on
multivariate phenotypes using high-dimensional data to compare directions, not just magnitudes, of associations.
For sleepiness, Aim 3 will utilize Drosophila RNAi lines to study the impact of knocking-down candidate genes
on sleep-related phenotypes (including sleep amounts, sleep fragmentation, and sleep drive). Then, genes
shown to affect sleep in Drosophila will be validated in a vertebrate model by utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 methods to
knock-out these same genes in zebrafish and studying the effects on similar sleep phenotypes. Taken together,
results in this Project and the other projects in this Program will provide essential knowledge about effector genes
for OSA and for sleepiness in OSA in humans. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the biological and
clinical impact of GWAS associations, and will facilitate more efficient clinical translation and incorporation of
genetic evidence into precision medicine approaches to OSA, as well as provide an important resource for the
broader scientific community and proof of principle for the field of applied genomics in OSA."

The University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) proposes to identify, provide financial support, and train a total
of 35 students from groups dramatically underrepresented in the biomedical sciences in order to prepare
them to successfully enter and complete a PhD program in a biomedical or biomedical-related discipline
at MU or any other highly competitive research-intensive institution.
This proposal presents a coordinated plan to strengthen the research, academic, and personal
interaction skills of promising and talented baccalaureate graduates by immersing each Scholar in an
independent research project with a faculty mentor and providing a coordinated academic and personal
support system. Specific MU PREP components include design and completion of an independent
research project; strong research mentoring by committed faculty, aided by prior training of faculty
mentors; training in responsible conduct of research and scientific expression; training in critical thinking
and analysis; peer and group mentoring; and presentation of their research results at
national/international meetings in the discipline.
PREP Scholars should thus begin their PhD programs with advanced research skills, with a faculty and
peer mentoring system in place, with connections to a broader discipline beyond MU, and with lasting
friendships with other graduate students in the life sciences.
The MU PREP program will be carefully coordinated with MU's other undergraduate and PhD programs
for underrepresented students thereby advancing MU's comprehensive effort to increase the number of
scholars from underrepresented populations in the biomedical sciences.
Successful parts of this program will be institutionalized and disseminated as a model for other

African Americans experience higher rates of alcohol-related sequalae (e.g., cirrhosis, mortality) relative to
their European American counterparts. It is thus critical from a public health perspective that we gain a deep
understanding of the unique factors contributing to alcohol use behaviors in African American individuals. To
this end, many studies have focused on understanding how social and environmental factors (social
determinants) contribute to increased alcohol use among African Americans. Yet, the mechanisms through
which these social determinants affect alcohol use behaviors are poorly understood, resulting in an absence of
vital information needed to enhance alcohol use disorders (AUD) prevention and intervention strategies. We
have recently shown that exposure to a common stressor, stereotype threat, is associated with increases in
impulsivity – a key mediating mechanism of AUD risk. Stereotype threat (ST) is a behavioral phenomenon that
arises when cues in the environment evoke negative stereotypes associated with an individual’s group,
triggering cognitive processes that adversely impact behavior. An enduring stereotype of African American
communities is that they experience high levels of alcohol/substance use. We have shown that exposure to
these negative race-related stereotypes elevates impulsivity. Further, our data reveal that this increase in
impulsivity correlates with alcohol use among African Americans. These findings reveal ST-induced impulsivity
as a novel correlate of AUD-risk behaviors. In line with NIAAA’s goal to develop a more thorough
understanding of the mechanisms contributing to AUD risk, we propose to investigate the neural mechanisms
associated with ST-induced impulsivity. We will further assess whether these neural mechanisms are
associated with alcohol use behaviors among African American adults. Participants will include 280 African
American adults who regularly consume alcohol. While undergoing functional MRI, all will complete a measure
of impulsivity administered both before and after an ST exposure manipulation. This manipulation will utilize a
2x2x2 between-subjects design to systematically manipulate exposure to a verbal ST prime, race-related
stimuli, and AUD-related stimuli in order to assess the effects of these exposures, independently and
combined, on neural systems involved in impulsive decision-making. Alcohol use behaviors will be assessed
outside of the scanner. We predict that ST exposure will lead to shifts within affect-related and cognitive
control-related brain regions. To increase clinical impact, we will assess the relation of ST-induced shifts in
impulsivity and brain response to alcohol use behaviors. Results from the proposed study will enrich our
understanding of how sociocultural, behavioral, and neural factors combine to influence AUD risk behaviors. In
addition, our results will provide greater insights into the neural systems implicated in AUD-risk – systems that
could serve as targets for novel strategies that enhance resilience."

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. There is a critical need to improve uptake of
evidence-based care for MI in resource-limited settings. This proposal presents a research career development
program to 1) identify barriers to evidence-based MI care in Tanzania, 2) develop a multicomponent intervention
to improve care by adapting proven strategies from other settings, and 3) assess the feasibility, acceptability,
and potential effectiveness of the intervention. The candidate, an Assistant Professor of Surgery at Duke
University and emergency medicine physician, has experience conducting research regarding MI in Tanzania.
The high MI-associated mortality he identified as an NIH Fogarty Global Health Fellow led him to seek additional
training in implementation science, intervention development, and clinical trial design. Working with a diverse
mentoring committee of experts in implementation research, clinical trials, and global cardiovascular disease, as
well as Tanzanian colleagues with whom he has collaborated for the past ten years, he will build upon his prior
study of MI in northern Tanzania. The proposed activities will equip the candidate with a combination of skills in
global emergency implementation research and position him to become a successful independent investigator
operating at the intersection of global health, emergency medicine, and implementation science.
Growing evidence suggests that in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), MI is common, frequently misdiagnosed, rarely
treated with evidence-based therapies, and associated with high mortality. Preliminary research conducted by
the candidate in Tanzania found that 22% of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with typical
symptoms have an acute MI, but 90% of acute MI cases are missed by ED physicians. The candidate’s research
found a 30-day mortality rate following acute MI of 43%--more than sixfold higher than the mortality rate in the
United States. Such poor MI outcomes are likely related to low uptake of evidence-based MI care; for example,
the candidate’s preliminary data found that only 23% of patients with acute MI were treated with aspirin—a WHO
“best buy” for reducing noncommunicable disease mortality. Despite these alarming data, the barriers to
evidence-based MI care in SSA remain largely unexplored and locally-tailored interventions to improve MI care
in resource limited settings are sorely lacking. There is an urgent need to identify barriers to MI care and to
develop locally-appropriate interventions that will improve MI outcomes in low-income settings like Tanzania.
This proposal will bridge this knowledge gap by using an approach rooted in implementation science.
Specifically, this study will 1) identify barriers to evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of MI in northern
Tanzania, 2) develop a multicomponent tailored intervention to improve MI care, and 3) determine feasibility,
acceptability, and potential effect of a tailored intervention on MI care. This study will be an important first step
towards reducing excess MI-associated morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings."

epidemic in the United States (US) that disproportionately affects American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN)
communities. AIAN youth are at the heart of the AIAN health crisis. AIAN youth are
disproportionately affected by many of these historical, structural, social, and behavioral factors that contribute
to significant health disparities including high alcohol, tobacco, opiate and other drug (ATOD) use and sexual
and reproductive health risks (SRH; ATOD-SHR). The overall mean age of tobacco use, alcohol use, and
marijuana initiation for AIANs is much younger (11.5 years) than the general population, with AIAN youth
having the highest prevalence of smoking and the earliest age of first use of ATOD. Alarmingly, more that 20%
of Native high school students who used a prescription pain med without a prescription also used heroin in the
past 30 days. Substance use is one of the most significant risk factors for unprotected sex and AIAN youth have
the earliest age of first sexual intercourse. AIANs under 25 years of age have three times the rate of chlamydia,
gonorrhea, and syphilis compared to White youth. Taken together, these ATOD-SHR disparities underscore
the urgent need for interventions that simultaneously target ATOD and SHR among AI teens. While there is a
paucity of research addressing the ATOD-SRH prevention needs of AIAN youth in general, there is even less
information available on ATOD-SRH-related disparities for the nearly 1 out of 10 AIAN youth attending the 183
tribal day or boarding schools nationwide. To address this crisis and the dearth of evidence-based programs for
this population, the proposed study, prepared in response to PAR-17-496, involves a 5-year RO1 to test the
preliminary efficacy of the Chemawa Journey of Transformation–Native Youth Health Leadership Program
(CHJ) which is an adapted and expanded version of the Discovering Our Story intervention, a 2010 SAMSHA-
identified best practice AIAN strengths-based comprehensive substance use and health risk prevention and
health leadership program for AIAN youth. The CJOT emphasizes a holistic, positive youth approach that
incorporates storytelling with traditional archetypes and responsibilities as both a process and metaphor for
guiding AIAN youth through behavioral change. The CJOT is a culturally-centered experiential 8-week (10
sessions) school-based positive youth health leadership development intervention to prevent ATOD use and
SHR among AIAN youth (ages 13-16). The program involves a 2-month intervention (3 individual sessions + 10
sessions) + 5 booster sessions including digital storytelling training + 1 community event (digital and oral
storytelling premiere) that targets behavior change relative storytelling and a youth-led storytelling event."

 Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) affects 3% of children and adolescents and results
in nutritional deficiencies, supplement dependence, and psychosocial impairment. ARFID follows a chronic
course, and has no evidence-based treatment. The hallmark feature of ARFID is food avoidance, which may
be maintained by extreme levels of food neophobia and/or hyperactivation of fear circuitry in response to
food cues. Our team has developed a manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-AR) that directly targets
both food neophobia (cognitive mechanism) and fear circuitry (neural mechanism) to reduce food avoidance
(clinical outcome). In line with NIMH’s experimental therapeutics approach, in this exploratory/developmental
phased R61/R33, we will leverage a multidisciplinary team of experts in the treatment of ARFID, neural
mechanisms of food motivation, and statistical analysis of clinical trials to conduct a mechanistic randomized
controlled trial of CBT-AR. First, to establish target engagement, we will randomize 50 youth (ages 10-18yo)
with ARFID in a 1:1 ratio to 15 weekly sessions (via telehealth) of CBT-AR vs. nutrition counseling to establish
target engagement. We chose nutrition counseling as our active control because it does not include the
crucial CBT-AR intervention of exposure, and is therefore unlikely to engage our target mechanisms. We
hypothesize that, compared to nutrition counseling, patients randomized to CBT-AR will show significantly
greater decreases in food neophobia (cognitive mechanism) and fear circuitry (neural mechanism) in
response to food cues during a standardized fMRI food cue paradigm (primary ROI: anterior cingulate cortex
[ACC]; secondary ROIs: amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]). We will also examine weekly change in food
neophobia (cognitive mechanism) to identify the number of sessions at which further benefit ceases, and use
this optimized dose of CBT-AR for the R33. We will move on to the R33 if we are able to demonstrate a
reduction of at least d=.40 in the CBT-AR group from pre- to post-treatment AND a post-treatment between-
group difference of at least d=.40 in CBT-AR vs. nutrition counseling in either food neophobia (cognitive
mechanism) OR fear circuitry (Go/No-Go ROI: ACC; neural mechanism). Next, we will randomize 70 youth
(ages 10-18yo) with ARFID in a 1:1 fashion to the optimized dose of CBT-AR or the same number of sessions
of nutrition counseling to replicate target engagement and establish target validation. We hypothesize that,
compared to nutrition counseling, patients randomized to CBT-AR will exhibit significantly greater reductions
in food avoidance, and that these reductions in food avoidance will be mediated by reductions in food
neophobia (cognitive mechanism) and fear circuitry (neural mechanism) activation. If successful, the
proposed intervention (CBT-AR) could fill an important unmet need for those living with ARFID and pave the
way for larger-scale efficacy and effectiveness trials."

 2 In individuals with bilateral vestibular hypofunction (BVH), vestibular responses to self-motion cues are reduced
 3 bilaterally, often without a defined cause. The persistent state of desensitization yields symptoms of bouncing or
 4 unstable vision, dizziness, imbalance, and falls; collectively, these symptoms lead to a substantial reduction in
 5 quality of life. However, despite the sizeable impact of BVH on quality of life, health care expenditures, and falls,
 6 interventions tailored to the specific needs of patients with BVH, as opposed to patients with unilateral lesions,
 7 have yet to be developed. The objective of this proposal is to investigate a novel strategy for improving vestibular
 8 function in individuals with BVH. The nervous system possesses a robust capacity to regulate neural activity in
 9 the face of changing environmental or internal conditions. When exposed to a weak sensory stimulus (e.g., slow
10 movements of the head), a specific type of neural plasticity, “homeostatic plasticity”, has been shown to increase
11 the responsiveness of the involved neurons to subsequent motion stimuli. In this project, we aim to determine if
12 such mechanisms, prompted by periods of subthreshold (i.e., low amplitude) motion, may serve as a potential
13 strategy for driving plasticity in the lesioned vestibular system. Specifically, in individuals diagnosed with BVH
14 we will (1) measure changes in sensitivity to self-motion cues immediately following a subthreshold motion
15 stimulus (Aim 1), (2) characterize changes in vestibular function after repeated exposure to a subthreshold
16 motion stimulus (Aim 2), and (3) determine if the addition of a subthreshold motion “primer” can improve the
17 outcomes of vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation (Aim 3A) and balance training (Aim 3B). We hypothesize
18 that the use of a subthreshold stimulus, secondary to its capacity to drive plastic changes in the vestibular
19 system, will lead to an increased sensitivity to self-motion cues, as well as positive changes in vestibular function
20 (e.g., gaze stability, balance), in patients with BVH. In accordance with the topic of the proposed research project,
21 my long-term career goal is to establish a research lab that focuses on developing innovative treatments for
22 vestibular dysfunction. To achieve this goal, the proposed career development plan focuses on acquiring the
23 skills and knowledge required to design, implement, monitor, and analyze the results of clinical trials in the
24 rehabilitation sciences; more specifically, this includes (1) gaining a better understanding of the
25 neurophysiological principles underlying vestibular plasticity/learning, (2) learning state-of-the-art techniques for
26 analyzing the behavior of the VOR, and (3) learning current methods for adapting the gain of the VOR. The
27 mentored phase of the training plan will take place at Ohio State University in the lab of Dr. Daniel Merfeld, PhD.

29 basic vestibular scientists, both at Ohio State (Daniel Merfeld, PhD & Kevin Kerber, MD) and at external
30 institutions (Michael Schubert, PT, PhD, and Soroush Sadeghi Ghandehari, MD, PhD).

The proposed research career development program seeks to investigate the mechanism by
which myeloid cells in brain tumors become immunosuppressive, preventing the immune system
from controlling the tumor even in the presence of immunotherapy designed to activate it. The
candidate is currently a Research Fellow in the Department of Pathology of the Massachusetts
General Hospital. The proposal incorporates specific technical skills that will be required for the
project including training in immune biology and advanced immune assay techniques. The
structured career development plan includes training and mentorship in laboratory management,
scientific leadership, research communications, grant writing, and other critical career skills.
These technical and career skills will be acquired under the guidance of Dr. Bradley Bernstein,
who will serve as primary mentor and has a history of trainees that obtain group leader positions
in academia, as well as a Research Advisory Committee of word-class scientists including Drs.
Mario Suva, John Iafrate, and Nir Hacohen. Through this comprehensive program, the candidate
will acquire a unique set of clinical and research skills that will enable him to transition to an
independent physician scientist faculty position with a lab focused on basic mechanisms and
therapeutic opportunities in brain cancer epigenetics and immunology.
The research strategy will investigate immunosuppressive tumor-associated myeloid cells in brain
tumors – where they come from, the epigenetic mechanism by which they become
immunosuppressive, and how to potentially transform them. Transforming or selectively killing
myeloid cells that express immunosuppressive programs offers great opportunity to sensitize
brain tumors to immunotherapy. However, it remains unknown if these myeloid cells come from
circulating monocytes or endogenous microglia, or what make them immunosuppressive,
significantly hindering the design of rational clinical strategies to target these cells in brain tumors.
The aims of this proposal are to: (1) Determine the origin of immunosuppressive myeloid cell
states in brain tumors, (2) identify the epigenetic regulatory factors that maintain the
immunosuppressive cell program, (3) discover perturbations that eliminate or transform
immunosuppressive myeloid cells. Overall, these studies will provide valuable data needed to
develop targeted therapies against immunosuppressive myeloid cells and increase the efficacy
of immunotherapy for brain cancer patients."

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is identified as a restrictive eating disorder in DSM-5 and is
associated with substantial medical morbidity, psychiatric comorbidity, and high treatment costs. Maintenance
mechanisms for ARFID are unknown. However, the cognitive behavioral model of ARFID suggests that
negative reinforcement, via reductions in negative affect, may be key in understanding these highly persistent
and medically compromising behaviors. This 5-year K23-Patient-Oriented Research Career Development
award application addresses this hypothesis using an innovative, multi-disciplinary approach to examine
differences in neural circuitry and hormone functioning in adults with ARFID compared to healthy controls (HC)
and to explore the relationships between real-time emotions and behaviors with brain responsivity and
endocrine signaling to food stimuli. Specifically, this proposal leverages ongoing data collection from a funded
R01 (MH108595) investigating the neurobiology of ARFID in youth and extends these methods by focusing on
adults and including one week of ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Activation in the amygdala,
hippocampus, anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex (brain regions in the limbic
and paralimbic circuits governing emotional processing) as well as cortisol and oxytocin levels around a
standardized meal (hormones associated with mood and anxiety) will be compared between adults with ARIFD
and HC. EMA ratings of negative emotions and eating behaviors will be used to test whether negative affect is
reduced following common problematic eating behaviors (i.e., food refusal) in ARFID. As a final aim, this study
will explore if activity in limbic/paralimbic circuitry and aberrant cortisol and oxytocin correlate with negative
affect levels as well as reports of avoidant/restrictive eating during the one-week EMA period. This project
represents the first exploration of ARFID in adults, the first examination of emotional functioning in ARFID, and
a rigorous first test of the cognitive-behavioral model of ARFID. The training plan corresponding to this project
will support Dr. Kendra R. Becker in becoming an independent clinical scientist with a program of research
examining neurobiological underpinnings of affect and reward maintenance mechanisms in feeding/eating
disorders to better understand illness trajectory and inform personalized formulations of pathology. Each aim of
the study corresponds to a specific training goal, which will map onto four main areas of competency for Dr.
Becker: (1) reproducible fMRI methodology, (2) study design and analysis/interpretation of endocrine data, (3),
EMA methodology including advanced longitudinal data analysis integrating neurobiological variables, and (4)
career development. Training goals will be implemented under the guidance of Dr. Jennifer J. Thomas (primary
mentor), Drs. Elizabeth A. Lawson and Laura M. Holsen (co-mentors), Drs. Stephen A. Wonderlich and Ross
D. Crosby (collaborators), and Drs. Kamryn T. Eddy and Madhusmita Misra (other significant contributors)."

Because the extracellular Ca2+ concentration is much higher than the cytoplasmic concentration, Ca2+ flows
into the cytoplasm, triggering fusion of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane
in less than a millisecond. Upon fusion, neurotransmitter molecules are released into the synaptic cleft, and
then bind to receptors located in the postsynaptic membrane. Finally, the fusion machinery is recycled for
further rounds of fusion in the presynaptic cell. Major questions about the molecular mechanisms of membrane
fusion and protein recycling remain. The architecture of the fusion machinery between the synaptic vesicles
and plasma membranes is unknown, and the molecular steps after Ca2+-triggering are unknown. Furthermore,
our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing synaptic release probability and presynaptic
plasticity is incomplete. Obtaining three-dimensional images of synaptic proteins within their natural membrane
environment will be an essential step towards answering these questions. We propose a stepwise, bottom-up
approach starting with simpler systems and moving to increasingly more complex systems. First, we will
employ a hybrid (ex vivo / in vitro) approach where synaptic vesicles are isolated from mouse brain
homogenates and combined with synthetic acceptor vesicles. Functional tests of this hybrid system will be
performed using a new single vesicle fusion assay that discriminates between different stages of membrane
fusion and includes many presynaptic proteins, including but not limited to SNAREs, synaptotagmin, and
complexin. The contact sites between isolated synaptic vesicles and synthetic vesicles will be imaged by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) followed by subtomogram averaging to reveal the architecture of these
presynaptic complexes in their membrane environment. Next, we plan to image the equivalent membrane
contact sites in both isolated synaptosomes and in synapses of neuronal cultures grown on EM grids. We
anticipate that reconstructions of presynaptic complexes obtained with the hybrid approach are the starting
point for locating such complexes in synaptosomes and in synapses in neuronal cultures. These in vivo
reconstructions might reveal new molecular interactions or associations. After fusion, the AAA+ protein NSF
and associated SNAP co-factors are essential for disassembly of SNARE complexes and for quality control of
newly formed SNARE complexes (in conjunction with Munc18 and Munc13). Previously, we determined single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the complex of NSF, αSNAP, and the neuronal
SNARE complex under non-hydrolyzing conditions. We now aim to investigate the molecular details of
disassembly, what conformational changes are involved, and how ATP hydrolysis is coupled to these
conformational changes by cryo-EM."

Our understanding of immunity largely stems from models of infection with pathogenic microbes. However, the
vast majority of microbial-immune encounters occur as a symbiotic relationship with the commensal microbiota.
Recently, the contribution of commensal-specific T cells to host physiology has received significant attention.
These commensal-specific responses not only control microbiota containment but also promote antimicrobial
defenses via their action on both innate and epithelial cells. Local tuning of keratinocytes by commensal-specific
T cells also contributes to tissue repair following skin injury. Conversely, aberrant immunity to commensal
microbes has been proposed to underlie pathologies of barrier tissues, including atopic dermatitis and
inflammatory bowel disease. A better understanding of the properties and functions of commensal-specific T cell
responses is therefore fundamental to studies of tissue immunity in health and disease. Our long-term goal is to
better understand how commensal-specific T cell responses contribute to barrier tissue homeostasis, and the
objective in this application is to investigate the mechanisms regulating cytokine production during skin injury
and wound repair. Our rationale for the proposed work is that uncovering these mechanisms has the potential to
translate into new therapeutic approaches. Our central hypothesis is that commensal-specific T cells are
sentinels of the skin tissue and contribute to wound repair through rapid production of type-2 cytokines in
response to tissue injury. In this proposal, we will focus on two mechanisms, the post-transcriptional regulation
of IL-5 and IL-13 cytokine production by commensal-specific T through RNA-binding proteins and induction of
the integrated stress response. Based on strong preliminary data, we will test three specific aims: (1) Understand
the key proximal and distal IL-18R-signaling pathways that trigger poised type-2 immunity in commensal-specific
CD8+ T cells. We have recently found that IL-18 acting directly on CD8+ T cells can trigger rapid production of
IL-5 and IL-13. We will test the hypothesis that pathways unique to IL-18R, but not other IL-1R family members
triggers poised type-2 immunity in commensal-specific CD8+ T cells. (2) Determine the role of Untranslated
regions (UTR) of Il5 and Il13 mRNA in poised type-2 immunity in commensal-specific CD8+ T cells. We have
identified multiple RNA-binding protein motifs in the UTR of Il5 and Il13 mRNA. We will test the contribution of
these regulatory elements to poised type-2 immunity in commensal-specific CD8+ T cells. (3) Understand the
contribution of the integrated stress response to post-transcriptional regulation of Il5 and Il13 mRNA in
commensal-specific CD8+ T cells and the contribution to wound repair. Our approach is innovative as it
investigates new mechanisms of immunity unique to commensal-specific T cell responses. The proposed work
is significant because it will establish new insights into the interaction and communication between commensal
microbes and immune cells in the skin microenvironment and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention
in conditions of chronic non-resolving wounds and skin infection."

Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is the temporal relationship between neural activity and cerebral blood flow
(CBF). This neural-evoked hemodynamic response is fundamental to local cerebrovascular homeostasis and
is disrupted in cerebrovascular diseases, such as stroke, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, traumatic brain injury,
as well as Alzheimer's Disease. The neurons that express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (Nos1) are ideal
candidates for the regulation of NVC since nitric oxide (NO) is a very potent vasodilator. Our group has
recently developed a Tacr1CreER allele that enables the visualization and manipulation of these neurons. We
now have exciting preliminary data supporting the hypothesis that Tacr1 neurons mediate vasodilation. Here,
we propose to test this idea through a set of experiments that will: determine the relationship between Tacr1
neurons and blood vessels; examine causality in the regulation of NVC by Tacr1 neurons; and investigate the
underlying circuitry. These experiments include correlative studies that will establish whether the structure
(place) and function (activity) of Tacr1 neurons positions them to regulate CBF. We will also use optogenetic
approaches and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) to record CBF in awake behaving mice to test whether Tacr1
neurons necessary and sufficient for vasodilation. Finally, we will use a combination of optogenetic
manipulation, GCaMP6f-, and 2P-imaging to elucidate the underlying circuitry of NVC. Overall, our proposal
will address a critical gap in knowledge with respect to the specific neural mechanisms that underlie the BOLD
signal, which is a widely used, but poorly understood research and clinical tool. Moreover, this insight into
NVC is fundamental to our understanding of the pathogenesis of common cerebrovascular diseases and the
advancement of pharmacotherapeutics targeting cerebral perfusion."

RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS INCLUDING SARS-COV-2
SUMMARY
Respiratory viral infections caused by SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and
human parainfluenza virus are a significant public health burden globally. Although vaccines are available for
some of these viruses, the inequality in access and the constant virus evolution diminish their efficacy. Moreover,
effective therapeutics preventing and treating severe respiratory viral diseases are still largely lacking. In Project
2, we will exploit viral dependencies on host factor networks to gain insight into disease mechanisms and develop
new therapeutic approaches. We focus on relevant primary cell models, panviral mechanisms and innovative
reverse genetics technologies. In Aim 1, proteomics and transcriptomics analyses will be performed with the
Technology Core to determine global changes in protein abundance, post-translational modifications, and gene
expression profiles in infected primary human lung cells and three-dimensional human airway organoids. Results
will be integrated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics and Modeling Cores using existing -omics
and human GWAS datasets to search for signatures that correlate with clinical pathogenesis. In Aim 2, virus and
host genetics will be used to uncover host dependency factors critical for respiratory infection, using rapid SARS-
CoV-2 cloning as well as genome-wide CRISPR-screens. In Aim 3, using supernatants of infected cells and
patient serum samples, we will characterize the pro-inflammatory effects of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and other
secreted viral proteins in correlation with clinical data. With Project 1, we will test their effect on other respiratory
viruses and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We anticipate that these studies will have a significant impact
on public health measures against respiratory virus infections in the future."
10766195,"Understanding how animals make behavioral decisions is one of the biggest problems in neuroscience. The
proposed study aims to understand molecular and neural mechanisms underlying innate defensive behaviors
elicited by chemical cues from predator species. Defensive responses to predatory threats are made through a
pre-programmed defensive brain circuit, which has an ability to instantly make an appropriate behavioral decision
upon sensing predator-derived sensory stimuli. It is widely appreciated that olfaction is one of the major sensory
modalities through which predator-derived chemical cues trigger behavioral responses in prey species. When
prey animals detect immediate danger in predator cues, they exhibit acute defense behaviors such as freezing
or flight. On the other hand, when prey animals detect only potential danger in predator cues, they exhibit
vigilance and risk assessment behaviors such as repetitive stretched sniffing. An important question in behavioral
neuroscience is whether these defensive decisions for predatory threats are made through distinct neural circuits
or by a shared neural population. Our preliminary data establish a framework of the proposed study to dissect
defensive behavioral circuitries activated by predator cues through the vomeronasal chemosensory organ (VNO),
which trigger either freezing or risk assessment behaviors in mice. In this proposal, we aim to identify the
freezing- and risk assessment-inducing predator cues and their sensory receptors in the VNO, and to assess
whether the sensory signals induce behavioral outputs through independent, parallel circuitries, or they are
integrated in the brain to induce an appropriate behavior. Our central hypothesis is that different predator cues
are detected by distinct sensory receptor circuitries and elicit distinct defensive behavioral outputs in parallel. To
test this hypothesis, we will investigate mechanisms of the predator cue sensation at molecular levels; more
specifically, we will first identify the sensory stimuli (Aim 1) and the sensory receptors (Aim 2). Moreover, using
freezing- and risk assessment-inducing sensory cues as tools, we will further examine whether the defensive
decision towards predator cues is made by independent neural circuitries or not (Aim 3). The results from these
experiments will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the sensory processing in
predator cue sensation, and will reveal an operational principle of decision making circuitries for emotional
behaviors. This will critically contribute to our understanding of pre-programmed brain machinery that underlies
multiple levels of fear and stress processing in response to threat."

Glomerular injury leads to proteinuric kidney diseases that often progress to renal failure. Despite advances in
our understanding of the pathogenesis of glomerular disease, current treatment relies heavily on
immunosuppressive or anti-hypertensive drugs and specific treatments are still lacking. Regardless of the
underlying cause, one early and unifying event in glomerular injury is a morphological change in podocytes
called foot process (FP) effacement. Activation of αvβ3 integrin on podocytes is linked to early pathological
processes leading to FP effacement and the subsequent induction of proteinuria in several glomerular
diseases, including FSGS and DN. Conversely, blocking of αvβ3 activation significantly reduces proteinuria
and subsequent disease progression in animal models of FSGS and DN. However, there is currently no
clinically successful approach designed to target αvβ3 integrin.
 We recently discovered a novel role for inducible co-stimulator ligand (ICOSL) in the protection against
early glomerular injury (Koh et al., JCI, 2019). Glomerular ICOSL expression increases in early stages of
human FSGS and DN, followed by a drastic decline at later stages. ICOSL deficient animals are more
susceptible to kidney injury and severe proteinuria, and can be rescued by recombinant ICOSL injection.
ICOSL’s RGD motif is critically important for binding to activated αvβ3 as well as its protective function. Despite
this important discovery that ICOSL contributes to kidney protection, more detailed mechanistic studies are
necessary to fully understand the renoprotective behavior of ICOSL as a regulator of αvβ3 integrin and to
develop targeted therapies.
 Based on our published and preliminary data, we hypothesize that elevated ICOSL expression is a
mechanism launched by podocytes as an endogenous defensive response to limit progressive kidney injury by
counterbalancing the harmfully excessive activation of αvβ3 integrin. To test this hypothesis, we will precisely
define the essential temporal and spatial regulation of ICOSL expression necessary to deploy its protective
action (Aim 1), determine how ICOSL achieves renoprotection (Aim 2), and explore its therapeutic potential
(Aim 3). Our studies will be essential steps in moving toward successful development of novel specific
therapeutics for αvβ3 integrin-mediated glomerular diseases."
10553245,"Project Summary/Abstract
The innate immune response is the first line of defense against microbial infection. Virus infection causes rapid
induction of interferon (IFN) and IFN-induced genes, which are critical for antiviral defense. IFN regulatory
factor 3 (IRF3), expressed ubiquitously, is the key transcription factor for the induction of IFNβ and the antiviral
genes. Therefore, IRF3 deficiency leads to susceptibility to a wide range of virus infections. We have
discovered that IRF3, in addition to its transcriptional activity, has a non-transcriptional (nt) function, to kill the
virus-infected cells by a pro-apoptotic pathway, RIPA. Knock-in mice, expressing nt-Irf3 mutant, can mount
antiviral protection in the absence of antiviral genes. Recently, we demonstrated that nt-Irf3 functions
contribute to alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases, further strengthening the physiological significance of
nt-Irf3. In the current proposal, we present a new function for nt-Irf3 to inhibit the NF-κB activity and the
inflammatory gene induction. We termed this anti-inflammatory activity of IRF3 as Repression of IRF3-
mediated NF-κB Activity, “RIKA”. Our strong preliminary results demonstrate that: (a) IRF3-/- cells, in response
to viral or non-viral stimulation, express elevated levels of NF-κB-induced inflammatory genes compared to the
Wt cells, (b) IRF3 interacts with the NF-κB subunit to inhibit its transcriptional activity, and (c) the Irf3-/- mice
that are susceptible to respiratory virus infection, exhibit higher levels of NF-κB-induced genes in the lungs.
These results led to our central hypothesis that nt-IRF3, activated by either RIPA or transcription-independent
pathway, binds to p65, inhibiting the NF-κB-induced genes, and suppressing inflammatory pathogenesis. To
address this, using cellular and conditional knockout mouse models and respiratory virus pathogenesis, we
formulate two specific aims: (SA1) Investigate the molecular mechanisms by which IRF3 functions in RIKA,
and (SA2) Evaluate the contribution of RIKA to prevent inflammatory responses and viral pathogenesis.
Successful completion of these aims will delineate a new anti-inflammatory function of Irf3 that contributes to
its antiviral functions. Our research is innovative because it uses the novel in vitro and in vivo models to study
the molecular mechanism of RIKA, and its cell type-specific contribution to protect against inflammatory
pathogenesis. Our results will be significant as delineating a new anti-inflammatory function for IRF3 that
contributes to its antiviral innate immune responses will advance the field with a new functional branch of IRF3
that has implications in preventing inflammatory pathogenesis, beyond viral infection."

 The overarching goal of my research program is to elucidate the roles of dynamic DNA-histone
interactions in the nucleosome in regulating gene accessibility from single-molecule approaches. The
nucleosome is the fundamental packing unit of genes in eukaryotes and plays important roles in gene
regulation. Errors in gene regulation often lead to developmental failure and lethal diseases such as various
types of cancer. The nucleosome is made of ~147 bp ds-DNA with an octameric histone protein core. DNA and
histones are targets for various chromatin modifications that are often critically implicated in gene regulation
mechanisms. We reported several important changes in the structure and structural dynamics of the
nucleosome induced by various chromatin modifications and histone variants such as DNA methylation,
histone acetylations, SUMOylation, CENP-A, and H2A.Z in the context of their roles in gene regulation. As
these changes are heterogeneous, unsynchronized, and/or complex, they are often impossible to resolve with
ensemble-averaging biochemical, genetic, and static structural biology tools. We develop and improve single-
molecule fluorescence methods and systems, mainly based on FRET, FCS, and colocalization at an optical
super-resolution to address these problems. We will continue pushing the boundaries of these experimental
systems and methods to support our future research that will center around three synergistic themes: how (1)
chromatin modifications and histone variants, (2) spontaneous molecular motions and interactions, and (3)
active and passive molecular machines and enzymes affect DNA-histone dynamics in nucleosomes and
nucleosome arrays and how the effects are implicated in gene regulation mechanisms.
 We recently started evolving our mostly nucleosome-focused experimental systems by combining
various enzymes that act on the nucleosome and expanding them to include nucleosome arrays. Based on
these systems, our research will continue largely in three topical areas in the next five years: (1) nucleosome
dynamics during its interaction with complex enzymes such as RNA polymerase II and Dot1L, a key player in
H3K79 methylation-dependent leukemia pathogenesis, (2) the effects of chromatin modifications on the
structure and dynamics of the nucleosome and their implications in nucleosome-enzyme interactions, (3)
conformations and dynamics of nucleosome arrays and the effects of chromatin modifications on nucleosome
dynamics in nucleosome arrays. Investigations in these areas will help understand the fundamental molecular
processes that regulate nucleosome dynamics and gene accessibility during nucleosome-enzyme interactions
in a nucleosome and a nucleosome-array context and at depth and clarity afforded by our highly-refined
tractable single-molecule systems."

My research program aims to make sense of modern genomic data through the lens of molecular evolution.
Drawing from ideas and techniques in statistics, artificial intelligence, and population genetics, we seek both to
understand the evolutionary forces that have shaped present-day genome sequences, and to use evolutionary
patterns to gain insight into the phenotypic importance of particular genomic sequences, with broad implications
for human health. Our work focuses in particular on three major areas: (1) evolutionary reconstruction based on
genome sequences; (2) inference of the fitness consequences of human mutations; and (3) the study of
transcriptional regulation and its evolution in mammals.
In the last funding period (2018–2022), we achieved major advances in each of these areas, including both
methodological advances and applications of new methods to important and timely scientific questions. For
example, we recently developed innovative new methods for the inference of ancestral recombination graphs
(ARGs) from multi-population sequence data; for the detection of selective sweeps using ARGs and deep neural
networks; for the identification of essential genes from CRISPR-Cas9 screens; for the estimation of relative RNA
half-lives based on widely available RNA-sequencing data types; and for the detection of gains and losses of
cis-regulatory elements along the branches of a phylogeny based on epigenomic data. These methods have all
been implemented as publicly available software tools. Based on these and other methods, we published a
variety of novel scientific findings, including the discovery and characterization of previously unknown
introgression events between modern and archaic hominins; a genomic analysis of South American birds
indicating their radiation was primarily driven by recent selective sweeps; an analysis indicating extensive
evidence of rapid evolution in immunity- and cancer-related genes in bats; and an analysis indicating that
enhancers are gained and lost at about twice the rate of promoters in mammalian evolution. These findings were
described in a total of 17 original papers and preprints.
For this renewal application, we propose to continue our research within each of these three key areas. Specific
goals include developing new statistical sampling methods that scale to very large ARGs; using domain
adaptation to reduce training bias in population genomics; measuring extreme levels of purifying selection from
patterns of rare variation in human populations; characterizing the distributions of fitness effects for polygenic
traits; identifying and characterizing deleterious variants linked to advantageous alleles; and developing a unified
biophysical modeling framework for nascent RNA sequencing data with applications to comparative genomics
and elongation-rate estimation. A renewal of R35 funding will enable us to remain highly productive contributors
to this critically important research area."
10767847,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical for actively maintaining immune tolerance. The Foxp family of
transcription factors is composed of four members; Foxp1, Foxp3 and Foxp4 are expressed in lymphocytes.
Foxp family members bind DNA as homo- and hetero-dimers to regulate gene expression. Regulatory T cells
are CD4+ T cells that express Foxp3. We have generated mice in which both Foxp1 and Foxp4 are deleted in
either all T lymphocytes or in Tregs, leaving Foxp3 the only potentially expressed family member in this T cell
subset. Our preliminary data demonstrate that combined loss of Foxp1 and Foxp4 in all T lymphocytes based
on CD4 Cre-mediated deletion substantially alters the development of Tregs in the thymus, reduces peripheral
Treg cellularity, and alters suppressive function. When loss of Foxp1 and Foxp4 is limited to the Foxp3+ Treg
population, there is a dramatic phenotype characterized by lymphocyte activation/expansion, autoantibody
production, and early lethality. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand how Foxp1 and Foxp4 alter
the development, homeostasis and function of Foxp3+ Tregs. To address this question we propose to
generate and use novel mouse strains in which Foxp1 and Foxp4 are deleted at different stages of Treg
development. We will use high throughput sequencing technology to investigate gene regulation by Foxp1
and/or Foxp4. We will test Tregs deficient in Foxp1 and Foxp4 in relevant models of autoimmunity and
transplantation. Understanding these fundamental aspects of Treg generation, homeostasis and function are
critical to translational strategies of Treg augmentation being developed for use in autoimmune disease and
solid-organ transplantation."
10745989,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Candida auris is an emerging pan-multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen and presents a serious global health
threat. Importantly, C. auris is the first fungal pathogen showing pronounced and sometimes untreatable clinical
drug resistance to all known antifungal classes, including echinocandins azoles, and amphotericin B.
However, the diagnostic tools for the early detection of drug resistance in C. auris infections are either inadequate
or not sensitive enough for the identification of drug resistant clinical isolates. Thus, the combination of antifungal
drug resistance, along with a lack of sensitive diagnostic assays impair efficient therapeutic strategies to
overcome or prevent drug resistance in C. auris. Hence, the overall objective is to develop and validate
SuperSelective PCR assays for the detection of mutations in genes encoding echinocandin or azole resistance,
despite an abundant background of wild-type C. auris DNA. We hypothesize that SuperSelective PCR assays
will detect mutant C. auris with a sensitivity exceeding 1:104 mutant:wild type for single nucleotide polymorphisms
at genetic loci conferring echinocandin or azole resistance. The premise is based on our proof-of-concept work
with an C. auris FKS1 mutation conferring high-level echinocandin resistance. We expect to test our hypothesis
and to accomplish the objectives by pursuing two Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate a novel SuperSelective
PCR platform to detect mutations in C. auris genes conferring resistance to echinocandin and azole antifungal
drugs. 2) Validate SuperSelective PCR assays to detect echinocandin and azole heteroresistance in the kidney
homogenates of mice with active candidiasis. The payoffs of this proposal are expected to be significant, because
the proposed study will develop a novel SuperSelective primer PCR platform to identify mutations,
heteroresistant or tolerant clinical C. auris isolates. It will also provide a framework for mechanistic understanding
of multidrug resistance in C. auris."
10811585,"Can Circulating Bile Acids Predict Knee OA Progression?
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Biomarkers that could predict the individuals with similar
risk factors that would progress is an unmet need. Increasing evidence indicates that OA progression is mediated
by low-grade systemic (obesity) and local (inflamed synovium) inflammation. Recently, a positive correlation
between serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a key proinflammatory product of the microbiome, obesity, joint
inflammation, and OA severity was reported and suggests an influence of microbiome and gut permeability in
the pathogenesis of OA. However, the extent to which low-grade inflammation-based mediators can predict OA
progression remains unclear.
Once known only for their role in nutrients absorption, primary bile acids (BAs) such as chenodeoxycholic and
cholic acid, and secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic and lithocholic acid, are signaling molecules generated
from cholesterol breakdown by the interaction of the host and intestinal microbiota that modulate intestinal
permeability. These bioactive metabolites act on several receptors that are highly expressed in cells of innate
immunity. They regulate diverse metabolic and inflammatory pathways in multiple cell types and tissues.
Importantly, human obesity is associated with altered BA metabolism and increased intestinal permeability.
Our preliminary studies in knee OA (KOA) subjects show that circulating BAs are significantly associated with
radiographic KOA and outcome scores. The most significant association was for cholic acid, that was significantly
associated with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) (r=0.44, p=0.01).
Interestingly, BAs also associated with synovitis (glycoursodeoxycholic acid, r=0.39, p=0.04), and with LPS
binding protein (LBP), a biomarker of KOA progression (cholic acid, r=0.41, p=0.03). Of interest, these
associations differed between obese and non-obese subjects. These observations suggest distinct BAs may be
key mediators of OA development and progression.
Therefore, we hypothesize that (1) BA profiles will be associated with MRI phenotypes of KOA, especially with
synovitis/effusion; 2) altered BA profiles are associated with KOA progression. To address this goal, we will
conduct our investigation in the carefully phenotyped FNIH/OAI Biomarkers Project cohort, with
semiquantitative and quantitative MRI scores and clinical and radiographic outcomes at 48 months available in
the OAI website, to relate circulating BAs with synovitis and KOA progression. The proposed experiments are
high risk and we will determine if 1) specific circulating BA are related to synovitis and KOA 2) define elements
of lipid pathogenesis that link KOA outcomes among all persons at risk. However, these studies might provide a
foundation to determine phenotypes of KOA and investigations into novel personalized interventions to reduce
KOA-related morbidity."
10765722,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
In the United States, substance use behaviors contribute to the leading causes of mortality and morbidity of
adolescents, and are associated with approximately $60 billion in economic costs per year. Negative peer
influence is a major environmental risk factor for early initiation of substance use and other risky behaviors.
However, group-based interventions and positive social supports are also beneficial for successful cessation of
substance use and addictive behaviors. Thus, social influences can contribute to adaptive or maladaptive
decision-making and depend on the context and nature of the influence. Despite the strong contribution of
peer influence to individuals' risky (or safe) decision-making, the mechanistic processes underlying
susceptibility and resilience to social influence have received limited investigation.
Here, we combine a longitudinal cohort design, functional neuroimaging, novel behavioral economic
paradigms, and a model-based approach to examine whether substance use, and changes in substance use, are
related to individual differences in two mechanisms by which social information influences risky decision-
making (Aims 1 & 2). To test the extent to which changes in substance use may also impact susceptibility to
social influence, we will further examine reciprocal effects of substance use on the mechanisms of social
influence over time (Aim 3). Our broad hypothesis is that biases in neural and behavioral processing of
information from social others contribute to the development of substance use behaviors in adolescents and
may explain why social others have an unusually large impact on certain adolescents' decisions to engage in
substance use."

Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of brain aging that may contribute to declines in function and neurodegenerative
diseases. As the resident macrophage of the brain, microglial are crucial to brain maintenance but have been
demonstrated to take on pro-inflammatory phenotypes with aging. The proposed research will examine the role
of microglia-specific epigenetic mechanisms in aging and determine the effects of obesity and aging interactions
on microglia phenotypic heterogeneity. We will determine whether aberrant age-related microglia-specific
epigenetic patterns can be reversed by heterochronic plasma approaches. Additionally, we will determine how
microglia subpopulations differ with age and obesity at a single-cell level with special interests in lipid-droplet-
accumulating microglia (LDAM). The goals of the training are to: 1) obtain a strong knowledge and foundation
in animal and nutritional models of anti-aging and obesity 2) gain hands-on experience in technologies and
bioinformatic skills needed for various omics approaches in specific hippocampal cells and at a single-cell level
3) apply these skills to achieve the research aims outlined in this proposal and 5) gain experience and improve
oral and presentation skills, manuscript and grant writing to enable a transition to independence. In Aim 1, we
hypothesize that exposure of old mice to young plasma will reverse age-related microglia-specific DNA
modifications to restore ‘youthful’ epigenomic patterns. This is based on the premise that DNA modifications are
key regulators of the diverse phenotypes required for the fulfillment of microglia functions which are disrupted in
aging. We will determine whether the administration of plasma from young into old mice can reverse age-related
microglial-specific hippocampal epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in Cx3cr1:NuTRAP mice using whole
genome oxidative bisulfite sequencing (WGoxBS) and RNA sequencing, respectively. These studies will identify
specific genomic sites amenable to the rejuvenating interventions and serve as targets for future epigenome
editing studies. In Aim 2, we will determine how the interaction of obesity and aging affect microglia
heterogeneity. We hypothesize that high-fat diet leads to expansion of pathological LDAM resulting in impaired
microglial function, which can be reversed by late-life calorie restriction. We will use single-cell transcriptomic
analysis, bulk transcriptomics and microglia functional assays (phagocytic uptake and cytokine/chemokine
analysis) to determine changes in microglia subpopulations in dietary-induced obese mice with age. In addition,
we will determine whether starting calorie restriction at 12 months in dietary-induced obese mice can mitigate
the effects of obesity on microglia heterogeneity. This will help identify mechanistic insights into microglia
heterogeneity, LDAM and obesity-associated neuroinflammation. In total, the training goals and objectives will
provide the needed skills and expertise to pursue a research career focused on developing anti-aging
interventions."

Lack of standards for neurophysiology data and related metadata is the single greatest impediment to fully
extracting return on investment from neurophysiology experiments. One of the greatest questions in science
today is understanding how the brain works and gives rise to thoughts, memories, perception, and
consciousness. To address this challenge, neurophysiologists within the NIH BRAIN initiative and around the
world perform experiments that measure neuronal activity from different parts of the brain and relate that
activity to sensation and behavior. A key component of the BRAIN Initiative is to support sharing of these rich
datasets and extend their value by enabling reuse of data within and across labs. The goal of this proposal is
to disseminate Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) neurophysiology technologies developed as part of the NIH
BRAIN Initiative broadly to the neuroscience research community. NWB is an award-winning,
community-driven data standard and software ecosystem for neurophysiology. To facilitate data sharing and
reuse, the NWB format standardizes how neurophysiology data and associated metadata are stored, and the
NWB software enables researchers to access and save data in the NWB format easily and efficiently. Several
leading neuroscience labs and institutions now produce data in NWB; however, a substantial energy barrier
remains for labs to standardize their data. To lower the barrier of adopting NWB, we propose a multifaceted
plan to make NWB easier to use by focusing on the needs of 1) neuroscience researchers and laboratories by
enhancing user training, support, and coverage of new technologies and 2) neuroscience tools and
technologies by maintaining core NWB technologies and integrating with a wide array of powerful data tools
and technologies. With NWB data as a target, scientists can access, manage, and share data using common
protocols, while developers have a common format on top of which to build tools. By targeting these two areas
simultaneously, we aim to reduce cost, time, and effort for analysis; improve quality, reliability, and accuracy of
results; and enable scientists to access new scientific capabilities. Successful completion of the proposed work
will enable broad dissemination of NWB to neuroscience labs and researchers and integration of NWB with
neuroscience tools, providing the research community with an accessible data standard and software
ecosystem that enhances utilization, sharing, quality, reliability, and analysis of neurophysiology data."

NIH Roadmap. To address a critical shortage in the next generation of otolaryngology surgeon scientists, new
opportunities are urgently needed. A new training program that integrates basic, translational, epidemiologic,
and clinical sciences into the clinical training of otolaryngology residents and medical students is proposed. The
integrated program will be delivered by the Department of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery at the
University Miami Miller School of Medicine (MSOM), incorporating proven approaches to address barriers that
prevent trainees from achieving successful academic surgeon scientist careers. The training program's mission
is to address these needs by: (1) supporting research opportunities in otolaryngology disciplines, (2) providing
strong curricula in an integrative framework, and (3) nurturing an interdisciplinary research culture that
emphasizes mentorship, academic advancement, grantsmanship, diversity outreach, responsible and ethical
conduct of research, and productivity. This training proposal seeks funding for the formation of the Miami
Otolaryngology Surgeon Scientist Training Program (MOSSTP) at the MSOM. The program offers dedicated
research training and mentorship for career development to medical students as well as otolaryngology residents
matching into an ACGME-approved 6-year Otolaryngology Residency Research Track. MOSSTP trainees will
be selected based on academic and research achievements as well as motivations to become an academic
surgeon scientist. Trainees will select a primary mentor from our highly qualified and diverse group of faculty
researchers that come from multiple departments at the MSOM and offer opportunities for immersive basic,
translational, epidemiologic / public health, and/or clinical research. Each year, we will recruit 1 otolaryngology
resident trainee for the ACGME-approved Otolaryngology Residency Research Track position through the
National Resident Matching Program to complete a career development training pathway designed for surgeon
scientists. We will also recruit and enroll two MSOM or external medical students annually through a formal
application process that goes through rigorous evaluation by selection and diversity committees. We will provide
immersive research training for medical students interested in otolaryngology to cultivate otolaryngology
research interests, encourage pursuit of otolaryngology residencies that include research training, and cultivate
young minds to engage in academic surgeon scientist careers. The success of our program will contribute to a
reversal of the downward trend in the number and diversity of otolaryngology surgeon scientists that compete
successfully for NIDCD-sponsored research awards and become creative contributors to the future of
otolaryngology."

 Prostate cancer incidence in the United States has significantly increased over the last two decades.
Despite the improvement of screening strategies, it remains challenging to accurately identify men at greatest
risk of progression to aggressive disease, early enough in the course of the disease to implement appropriate
measures that would improve their survival chances. In that respect, prostate cancer is governed by profound
disparities with African American (AA) men amongst the highest-risk population groups. Several studies suggest
a multifactorial etiology for such disparities, encompassing an accumulation of genetic aberrations. However,
genome-based prostate cancer biomarker discovery efforts have largely focused on the nuclear genome,
overlooking the smaller but essential mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). Indeed, alterations in mtDNA-encoded
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes have been associated with increased prostate cancer risk,
particularly in AA men, but their exact functional impact remains unknown. Therefore, understanding the
underlaying mitochondrial determinants of prostate cancer disparities could ultimately lead to better precision
interceptions and biomarkers for stratifying patients that will develop aggressive prostate cancer.
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how mtDNA alterations, present in aggressive
prostate cancer contribute to disease outcomes in high-risk groups and how to use this knowledge for more
effective precision cancer interceptions. In particular, my preliminary data strongly suggest an important role for
mitochondrial dysfunction in driving aggressive prostate cancer. Given that among other carcinogenic alterations,
adaptations in mitochondrial metabolism may contribute to prostate cancer formation and progression, this
proposal will leverage unique prostate cancer mouse models of mitochondrial dysfunction to address specific
mitochondrial vulnerabilities for cancer precision interceptions. I hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction acts
a critical driver of aggressive prostate cancer, and that it can be exploited for interceptive purposes. Specifically,
in Aim 1, I will identify mtDNA alterations in mtDNA GEMMs and assess their clinical relevance for prostate
cancer disparities. In Aim 2, I will use metformin interception as a proof-of-concept for establishing precision
strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in prostate cancer. In Aim 3, I will exploit mtDNA GEMMs to
investigate how OXPHOS vulnerabilities are linked to mitochondrial metabolic rewiring in aggressive prostate
cancer and, identify novel mitochondrial-related biomarkers to improve precision prostate cancer interception.
 The career development plan outlined in this award leverages my training at Columbia University and an
exceptional advisory committee into an innovative research strategy to guide my career into precision
approaches for the interception of aggressive prostate cancer. This proposal will provide the conceptual
groundwork, preliminary data, and experimental tools for a competitive R01 submission, thus launching my
independent career."

When faced with environmental stress, cells and organisms must conserve resources by decreasing global
translation and simultaneously upregulating stress-responsive genes. How cells do this has eluded
researchers yet promises insight into basic cell biology and novel therapeutics. This proposal takes an
innovative approach to the problem by developing a naturally stress-tolerant fish as a model for the cellular
stress response and using it to examine the contribution of membraneless organelles (in particular stress
granules (SGs)) and small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) to gene expression regulation and stress tolerance.
SGs are highly conserved stress-induced assemblies of RNA and protein which may regulate gene expression
by selective sequestration of RNAs and proteins, however their function remains unknown. Small ncRNAs,
such as microRNAs, can regulate the gene expression of particular mRNAs by preventing their translation into
protein, yet identifying adaptive ncRNAs that function in the stress response remains challenging. The annual
killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus inhabits temporary ponds in Venezuela that expose developing fish embryos
to harsh environmental conditions, including anoxia. A. limnaeus embryos can survive over 100 days without
oxygen and cells derived from A. limnaeus embryos can survive two weeks without oxygen. A. limnaeus
display unique SG and ncRNA biology. Our preliminary data show that A. limnaeus cells treated with sodium
arsenite do not form SGs, but still shut down translation. This surprising finding suggests that SG avoidance
may be adaptive and support anoxia tolerance in killifish cells. Small ncRNA studies in anoxia-tolerant
vertebrates identified mitochondria-derived small ncRNAs (mitosRNAs) as putative regulators of gene
expression driving anoxia-induced metabolic depression in A. limnaeus embryos. These mitosRNAs may
therefore underpin organismal anoxia tolerance and represent a novel stress response mechanism. This
proposal will address the following questions: 1. How do killifish cells decouple translation inhibition from stress
granule formation?; 2. How do mitosRNAs regulate protein synthesis under stress?; and 3. How do SG
avoidance and mitosRNA expression support anoxia tolerance? Understanding the mechanism and
consequences of these cellular phenomena will offer unique insight into fundamental cell biology that may
inform treatments for heart attack and stroke, as well as mitochondrial and neurodegenerative diseases. This
proposal will facilitate the career development and transition to independence of a female scientist committed
to promoting and supporting diversity in STEM. The mentored phase will be conducted in the rich training
environment of Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School to facilitate her career development.
Transitioning to independence will poise her to advance inclusive excellence in higher education and STEM,
including fostering the success of diverse trainees her in lab."

The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify novel addictions in mesenchymal colorectal cancer (CRC)
that will create new vulnerabilities to be targeted therapeutically. This type of aggressive CRC shows a
microsatellite stable phenotype, characterized by a strong reactive desmoplastic stroma and immunosuppressed
microenvironment. Mesenchymal CRC is enriched in a transcriptomic CMS4 signature, affects about 30-40% of
all CRCs with the poorest prognosis, and lacks effective therapies. Our recently published and preliminary data
demonstrated that the loss of the two atypical protein kinase Cs (aPKCs; PKC/ and PKC, encoded by PRKCI
and PRKCZ genes) drives the mesenchymal phenotype in mouse intestinal tumors. Furthermore, interrogation
of human specimens and transcriptional datasets of CRC patients established the aPKCs as new suppressors
of mesenchymal CRC. Our data also show that PKC/ is the one whose inactivation unleashes transformation
through the mesenchymal route, and new preliminary results, which constitute the foundation of this proposal,
demonstrated that aPKC inactivation in several models results in the upregulation of a cholesterol biosynthetic
signature and promotes cholesterol synthesis in vivo as evidenced by metabolic tracing experiments in mice.
Analysis of human CRC data and samples demonstrate a positive correlation between the activation of the
cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and mesenchymal CRC, associated with a negative correlation with aPKC
levels. Also, PKC/ directly phosphorylates SCAP, an obligate regulator of SREBP2 processing, which is the
master regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this application is that PKC/
by phosphorylating SCAP restrains the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway to repress tumorigenesis in
mesenchymal CRC. Building on our strong preliminary data, we will (Aim 1) determine the role of increased
cholesterol metabolism in mesenchymal CRC initiation and progression. To that end, we will determine the
impact of feeding a high-cholesterol diet (Aim 1.1) or blocking cholesterol metabolism in vivo (Aim 1.2) in tumor
initiation and progression of mesenchymal CRC tumors driven by PKC/ deficiency; and determine the human
relevance of PKC/-regulated cholesterol metabolism in mesenchymal CRC (Aim 1.3). We will also (Aim 2)
determine the molecular mechanisms whereby PKC/ regulates cholesterol biosynthesis in mesenchymal CRC
tumorigenesis. Therefore, we will (Aim 2.1) determine the impact of PKC/-mediated SCAP phosphorylation on
regulating the SCAP/SREBP2 complex at a mechanistic level; and (Aim 2.2) determine the functional
contribution of PKC/-mediated SCAP phosphorylation to CRC in vivo. The results from this proposal will allow
the identification of new targets as therapeutic points for intervention in mesenchymal CRC."

Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an emerging target for the treatment of solid tumors. Investigations of
the therapeutic relevance of STING agonists have primarily focused on the immunomodulatory effects
mediated by STING-activation dependent induction of type I interferons (IFN) in the tumor microenvironment.
However, how IFN signaling induced by STING agonists impacts malignant cell signaling and metabolism is
poorly understood and, whether these effects can be therapeutically exploited has not been investigated. Data
are presented showing that STING is highly over-expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and
that its activation in PDAC malignant cells results in impaired tumor growth in an IFN-signaling dependent
manner. Thus, elucidating the consequences of STING-driven IFN signaling is particularly relevant in PDAC
which is the third-leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the U.S. with an overall survival of less than one
year. Preliminary metabolomic and proteomic analyses point to two major interconnected biochemical
processes impacted by IFN signaling in PDAC cells: (i) nucleotide metabolism, which is evidenced by the
depletion of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) pools; and
(ii) activation of the DNA replication stress response signaling pathway mediated by Ataxia Telangiectasia and
Rad3-related protein (ATR). This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that STING-driven dNTP and
NAD depletion in malignant cells result from the transcriptional upregulation of SAM domain and HD domain-
containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), a powerful dNTP phosphohydrolase, and of specific members of the poly-
ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) family (PARP9/10/14) which increase NAD consumption, respectively. It will
further test the hypothesis that malignant cells engage specific adaptive mechanisms to counteract these
metabolic alterations and that their inhibition will synergize with STING agonists. Studies in Aim 1 will
investigate the consequences of STING activation in orthotopic PDAC cell line and patient-derived xenograft
models from a pre-existing repository and will investigate mechanistic links between STING activation and
replication stress. Studies in Aim 2 will test rationally designed combination therapies that block two major co-
dependencies elicited by STING activation in PDAC cells: (i) the ATR-regulated replication stress response
and (ii) nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-mediated nicotinamide recycling. Studies in Aim 3
will employ immunocompetent implantation and autochthonous PDAC models to test the concept of targeting
co-dependencies identified in Aims 1 and 2 in the context provided by ongoing clinical trials in which STING
agonists are combined with immune checkpoint blockade. Collectively, studies proposed in this application are
designed to increase the understanding of the interplay between STING signaling, nucleotide/NAD metabolism
and replication stress response in PDAC with the ultimate goal of uncovering critical vulnerabilities to be
exploited by new therapeutic approaches against this extremely aggressive and difficult to treat malignancy."

Prostate cancer (PC) afflicts more men in the U.S. than any other malignancy and is the second leading cause
of cancer death in this population. Recently, new therapies have improved survival in some men but have offered
little benefit to others. Tissue profiling has identified genes and pathways associated with resistance and
progression to advanced disease, but little is known about the dynamics of when and how such changes arise
during therapy. Such insights can only be gained through minimally invasive monitoring that allows repeated
disease profiling over time. Our multidisciplinary team has developed and tested two such minimally invasive
monitoring capabilities: The first is multi-parametric liquid biopsy: streamlined analysis of blood samples that
simultaneously measures PC-relevant cellular and molecular features from single circulating tumor cells and
matched plasma cell-free nucleic acids. The second is radiomic analysis: high-throughput extraction of
quantitative metrics to identify PC-relevant phenomic imaging features. By synergizing the strengths of the two
methods, our goal is to test the hypothesis that liquid biopsy and radiomic techniques can be applied jointly to
monitor metastatic PC noninvasively over time, culminating in new prognostic and predictive tools to guide
therapy. To maximize the impact of our findings, liquid biopsy profiling and radiomic analysis will be integrated
into Southwest Oncology (SWOG) S1802, a phase 3 prospective therapeutic trial for over 1200 men with newly
diagnosed metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) treated with standard systemic therapy alone
or in combination with definitive treatment of the primary tumor. Notably, SWOG and the other participating
cooperative groups have reviewed and approved this proposal (see Letters of Support), and the requisite blood
samples and CT scans already are being collected as part of the active protocol. In this unique setting, we will
pursue three Specific Aims. We will: 1. Use multi-parametric liquid biopsies to monitor the evolving cellular and
molecular landscape of mCSPC during treatment in S1802; 2. Use radiomic analysis of CT scans to monitor the
evolving radiographic landscape of mCSPC during treatment in S1802; and 3. Integrate cellular, molecular, and
radiomic data to develop composite disease monitoring models predictive of PFS and OS. Importantly, liquid
biopsies and CT images will be matched within patients and analyzed at key inflection points over the course of
the trial: at diagnosis, after initiation of systemic therapy, after definitive therapy, and at disease progression. In
this way, the proposed work will illuminate when and how PC-relevant phenotypes arise during therapy, and how
they relate to clinical outcomes. In particular, we will better understand which components of the liquid biopsy –
circulating cells, plasma, or both – most accurately reflect the tumor's evolving molecular profile, which radiomic
metrics most closely correlate with these molecular features and can serve as early cost-effective indicators of
emerging resistance, and which composite models combining liquid biopsy and radiomic features best predict
PFS and OS and can serve as powerful minimally-invasive tools to monitor and adjust therapy."

 A hallmark of alcohol use disorder is continued seeking and consumption of alcohol despite negative
consequences. Neuroadaptations in corticostriatal projections to nucleus accumbens are critical for the
development of compulsive-like alcohol use behaviors, including in an aversion-resistant drinking model. Yet it
remains unclear how potentiated activity in nucleus accumbens neurons alters sensitivity to aversive outcomes
during consumption and seeking of alcohol. Pre-existing individual differences in aversion-related circuits have
been shown to predict future compulsive-like alcohol consumption. Yet, we are not aware of any
demonstrations of alcohol-induced neuroadaptations in aversion-related circuits that track the development of
aversion-resistant drinking, and that account for the emergence of this compulsive phenotype after alcohol
exposure. Our long-term goal is to identify dynamics changes in the activity of aversion-related neural circuits
that drive the emergence of compulsive alcohol use. Here, we will examine glutamatergic basal forebrain
neurons that project to the lateral habenula. These neurons are found in an anterior-posterior continuum from
the ventral pallidum to the lateral hypothalamus and are targeted by nucleus accumbens inhibitory projection
neurons. We hypothesize that the emergence of aversion-resistant drinking requires selective inhibition of
these neurons during alcohol consumption.
 A crucial first step in our investigation of this circuit is to determine whether the emergence of aversion-
resistant drinking is correlated with cell-type specific alterations in drinking-related neural activity in the
glutamatergic basal forebrain. We will assess this question, and whether these neural correlates are
downstream of nucleus accumbens mechanisms in Aim 1. Our second goal is to examine lateral habenula
glutamate activity dynamics during aversion-resistant drinking. Therefore, our Aim 2 experiments will utilize a
fluorescent glutamate sensor combined with fiber photometry to identify temporally-specific neural correlates of
aversion-resistant drinking. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use chemogenetic approaches to assess the functional
contributions of basal forebrain projections to lateral habenula in aversion-resistant drinking and determine
which inputs to lateral habenula from regions of the glutamatergic basal forebrain most effectively modulate
compulsive alcohol consumption. Together, these experiments will yield novel insights into the neural circuits
mediating compulsive alcohol use, as well as aversion-related constraint of reward-seeking more broadly."

Our research program develops and applies innovative mass spectrometry technologies, bioinformatics tools,
and methodologies to transform our understanding of cell surface proteins and glycans and answer outstanding
questions in stem cell biology and cardiac pathology. Our analytical platforms promote the development of new
reagents and strategies to improve the quality and homogeneity of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes for research
and clinical applications and the discovery of strategies to monitor and treat patients with advanced heart failure.
Specifically, our approaches enable the identification, characterization, and quantification of cell surface
glycoproteins and glycans from small numbers of human cells. To date, we have developed new markers for
identifying cardiomyocytes with high specificity and selecting maturation stage-specific stem cell derived
cardiomyocytes to enable reproducible assessment and isolation of functionally-defined cells. Applying our
technologies to primary human heart tissue, we have begun to develop cell-type specific views of the cell surface
proteome and glycome within normal and failing hearts. We have also developed innovative bioinformatics tools
to inform our next level of technology development to enhance our capabilities and improve the speed and
accuracy with which we analyze our mass spectrometry data. The proposed studies build on these experiences
to: 1) develop the next generation technology that will provide unparalleled specificity regarding the molecular
phenotypes presented at the cell surface, information that is not possible to obtain by any current method, 2)
develop marker panels that enable the assessment and selection of chamber- and maturation-stage specific
stem cell derived cardiomyocytes without genetic editing, 3) define the cell-type specific receptors, membrane-
bound ligands and secreted factors present in the normal human heart and how they change in disease to
provide new understanding of intercellular signaling and inform the development of remote sensing markers to
benefit the care of patients with advanced heart failure. The impact from the proposed studies lies within future
applications and mechanistic studies that will be possible based on the approaches and data that we generate.
As our program evolves to pursue mechanistic and translational studies of the molecules revealed by our
discovery efforts, we expect the outcomes of these studies will broadly impact the development of strategies to
improve the quality of stem cell derivatives to promote their utility for drug testing, disease modeling, and
therapeutic applications, inform the development of cell-type directed payload delivery systems and drugs that
avoid cardiotoxic effects, and yield new strategies to assess and treat advanced heart failure."
10738751,"Aminoglycoside antibiotics (AGAs) are potent antibiotics which have long been used as
potent broad-spectrum antibiotics, with targets including Gram-negative and Gram-positive
pathogens, and complex infectious diseases such as hospitalized CAPD and exacerbated CF.
 Apramycin is a novel aminoglycoside antibiotic that retains all of the typical advantages
of the aminoglycosides but, because of its unusual structure, offers the additional benefits of
avoidance of the vast majority of aminoglycoside resistance determinants and of reduced oto-
and nephrotoxicity. As such apramycin is currently in clinical trials in Europe and in the USA for
the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections.
 A major advantage of apramycin is its lack of susceptibility to activity-damaging
alteration by aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, with the single exception of the
aminoacetyltransferase isozyme AAC(3)-IV, which portends well for its use against carbapenem-
resistant Gram-negative infections. Nevertheless, resistance due to the acquisition of the
AAC(3)-IV gene will eventually inevitably emerge. The goal of this proposal is to test the novel
hypothesis that advanced apramycin analogs (apralogs) can be designed and easily prepared
that circumvent the AAC(3)-IV resistance determinant through the introduction of a simple
hydroxy or alkoxy group at the 2-position on the deoxystreptamine core of apramycin, ie, based
on the streptamine core.
 To test this novel hypothesis a series of some forty advanced apralogs will be prepared
based on the streptamine core and screened, in an iterative feedback loop, for antibacterial
activity in the presence of AAC(3)-IV and other resistance mechanisms. Compounds will also be
screened for activity at the target level using cell-free translation assays with bacterial
ribosomes and for selectivity over eukaryotic ribosomes using comparable cell-free translation
assays with mutant bacterial ribosomes carrying human decoding A sites. These later studies
will provide a measure of selectivity and are predictive of toxicity, thereby ensuring that the
excellent toxicity profile of the parent apramycin is retained in the new analogs.
 At the end of the study, the goal is to have a small set of advanced compounds that are
not susceptible to the AAC(3)-IV mechanism of resistance, and retain the otherwise excellent
broad spectrum activity and minimal toxicity of the parent apramycin."
10836340,"There is a critical need to increase the recruitment of a diverse workforce and develop next-generation scientists
who can conduct research in areas relevant to the NIH mission, particularly that of the NIDDK. Science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers are the fastest-growing occupation in the United
States, with around 70% of jobs requiring some education past high school. Yet less than 20% of college
graduates earn degrees in a STEM-related field, the initial step in accessing a research career. This number is
far lower for individuals from geographically- and economically-disadvantaged backgrounds and
underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups and American Indian/Native Americans. Moreover, students
from diverse backgrounds face numerous challenges that threaten their entry into and persistence in
undergraduate STEM studies, and ultimately into the STEM workforce.
To address this shortfall, we developed a training program titled ""Aspirnaut™ K-20 STEM Pipeline for Diversity
and Wellness"" at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). Since the program's inception in 2009, 137
undergraduate students from 24 states have matriculated into the pipeline. Ninety-eight percent were from
diverse backgrounds and 93% of the graduates pursued advanced STEM degrees. Among these trainees, 84
were sponsored by our R25 grant from 2013 to 2021.
In this renewal, we will leverage our success over 13 summers with the Aspirnaut™ training pipeline. In Aim 1,
we will recruit 40% of participants from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups and American Indians/Native
Americans and 70% from geographically- and economically-disadvantaged backgrounds and/or limited family
level of education. In Aim 2, we will engage undergraduate students in a guided discovery science experience
on the topic of ""Renal Biology and Disease."" In Aim 3, we will augment the discovery science experience with
guided professional skills development. In Aim 4, we will enhance the discovery science experience with guided
wellness training. Additionally, we will implement several innovations, piloted over the previous funding cycle, to
perfect a holistic model of the training pipeline.
The anticipated outcomes will increase the number and diversity of undergraduates entering STEM disciplines
of relevance to the NIDDK mission and serve as a model for replication."

Much of the youth resilience literature to date has focused on resilience to family adversity, with far less
examining resilience to neighborhood adversity. This is a key gap in the literature because neighborhood
disadvantage is a robust indicator of poor outcomes throughout the lifespan. The focus on only one type of
resilience (psychiatric) to the exclusion of others (social, emotional, and academic) and the inconsistent
evidence of stability in resilience across development further exacerbate this gap. The transitions from middle
childhood to adolescence and adolescence to emerging adulthood are important developmental periods
marked by agency, cognitive, and self-regulation gains. The proposed research aims to examine not only how
resilience can change from middle childhood to adolescence and to later emerging adulthood, but whether
these developmental changes vary by type of resilience (psychiatric, social, emotional, academic), and finally,
how those changes might differ with protective factors (i.e., warm and involved parenting, structural
neighborhood protective features). During the K99 phase, Specific Aim 1 will investigate trajectories of the
multifaceted conceptualization of resilience from middle childhood to adolescence and Specific Aim 2 will
examine how these resilience trajectories may change when considering the protective factor of warm and
involved parenting. During the R00 phase, Specific Aim 3 will investigate how a comprehensive set of positive
structural neighborhood features (previously linked to resident well-being) promote youth resilience during the
critical transitions between middle childhood and emerging adulthood. Dr. Elizabeth Shewark’s background in
developmental psychology, family systems, advanced methods, and neighborhood effects uniquely positions
her to carry out this line of research. Dr. Shewark’s long-term career goal is to lead an interdisciplinary
research team that investigates how and by what mechanism(s) the contexts in which youth are developing
impact their resilience. To independently lead this future research team, the goal of this Pathway to
Independence Award is to build expertise in youth resilience to neighborhood adversity, and gain further
training in cutting edge longitudinal analytic techniques, the assessment of positive structural neighborhood
features, and conducting research in vulnerable at-risk populations. The proposal includes a highly established
group of researchers who will strengthen the interdisciplinary impact of Dr. Shewark’s work and her
development into an independent researcher. The theoretical knowledge and methodological skills gained
during this project will allow Dr. Shewark to produce a rich body of research on how warm and involved
parenting and structural neighborhood protective factors shape the development of youth resilience, facilitating
the identification of modifiable targets for intervention programs to promote healthy youth development."
10804620,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease that is highly prevalent among
veterans. Pulmonary rehabilitation which incorporates exercise training and self-management education is
recommended as standard management for COPD and aims to increase daily activity and quality of life through
improvement in symptoms and exercise tolerance and prompting health behavior change. Although insomnia is
common is veterans with COPD, the self-management education component of pulmonary rehabilitation does
not address sleep, thus potentially explaining the lack of improvement in sleep following pulmonary
rehabilitation. Insomnia can substantially impact the intended treatment goals of pulmonary rehabilitation as it
has been found to be associated with limitations in activities of daily living (ADL), lower levels of physical activity,
poor quality of life, greater COPD symptoms, and reduced exercise performance. Given that sleep is not
addressed as part of pulmonary rehabilitation, untreated insomnia may partly account for the declines in quality
of life and exercise capacity and absence of increased daily activity often reported following pulmonary
rehabilitation. Implementing an insomnia-specific treatment in COPD patients undergoing pulmonary
rehabilitation is likely to lead to improvements in sleep that could facilitate maintenance of gains in quality of
life and exercise capacity and enhance daily activity levels following pulmonary rehabilitation. Cognitive-
behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) not only improves sleep-specific symptoms of insomnia but also
improves quality of life, reduces ADL limitations, and improves condition-specific symptoms. We postulate that
CBT-I as an adjunct to home-based pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD patients with insomnia will lead to
improvement in sleep quality that will facilitate achievement of optimal and enduring functional outcomes
following pulmonary rehabilitation. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of
veterans with COPD and insomnia enrolled in home-based pulmonary rehabilitation assessed pre-pulmonary
rehabilitation, post-pulmonary rehabilitation and at 6-month follow-up to test the impact of Internet-based CBT-
I during home-based pulmonary rehabilitation on sleep and health-related functioning relative to home-based
pulmonary rehabilitation only. We also examine whether sleep mediates the effects of treatment on health-
related functioning."

Cocaine, the second highest used illegal drug in the US, reduces CNS immune responses to HIV-1, increasing
the severity and onset of HIV-1-mediated neurotoxicity. Astrocytes are the first line of defense against toxicity
in the CNS and initiate inflammatory responses to HIV-1 and antiviral activity following cocaine exposure (33);
however, uncontrolled inflammation and the failure to control HIV-1 replication is a continued problem.
Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), together with absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like receptor
inflammasomes, their interactions, crosstalk and dual scaffolding could be key mechanisms triggering
inflammatory and antiviral signaling in cocaine and HIV-1. Cocaine exposure in astrocytes, increases
interferons (IFNs) (33) and activity of the IFN stimulated response element (ISRE), presumably via MAVS. We
identified that cocaine induced mitochondrial toxicity, which regulates MAVS function and AIM2 inflammasome
activation (30, 77). We discovered that cocaine exposure in astrocytes is a major regulator of AIM2 priming
measured by increased caspase-1 cleavage and AIM2 levels, an IFN stimulated gene (ISG) (32, 88).
Furthermore, MAVS plays a crucial role in cocaine induced AIM2 priming as demonstrated in MAVS
downregulated astrocytes. Dual overactivation of MAVS and AIM2 produce chronic inflammatory pathologies,
via NFκB signaling and IFN production (16, 23). We established that repeated cocaine exposure reduced
MAVS cleaved products and increased MAVS aggregation, which differentially dictate IFN and NFκB signaling,
and we measured increased cytokines/chemokines and decreased IFNβ. Interestingly, AIM2 binding partner,
adaptor associated speck-like protein (ASC), binds MAVS via caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-CARD
homotypic interactions to inhibit MAVS-induced IFN generation (35). ASC is regulated by kinases initiated by
MAVS and IFN signaling (36, 37) and may play a vital role in promoting AIM2-induced aberrant
neuroinflammation and reduced MAVS antiviral signaling, in cocaine and HIV-1.
 We hypothesize that cocaine promotes MAVS activation via mitochondrial toxicity, priming
AIM2 inflammasomes. Repeated cocaine exposure, and/or HIV-1, results in dual recruitment of ASC to
astrocyte MAVS/AIM2. ASC recruitment initiates signal transduction events triggering astrocyte-
induced inflammation and decrease antiviral signaling, promoting astrocyte-induced neurotoxicity in
cocaine and HIV-1. To test this hypothesis we will uncover mechanisms by which cocaine cause AIM2
inflammasome priming via astrocyte MAVS activation (Aim 1); delineate astrocyte MAVS and AIM2 scaffolding
and crosstalk on AIM2 inflammasome oligomerization and signaling (Aim 2); and explore the impact of
astrocyte ASC regulation/recruitment in AIM2 signaling and attenuated MAVS activation in cocaine and HIV-1.
Repeated cocaine exposure, and/or subsequent introduction of HIV-1, inundates the innate immune response
producing a hyperimmuno and decreased antiviral phenotype, increasing the risk of HIV-1 neurotoxicity."

Dr. Arthur Owora is a biostatistician and quantitative epidemiologist whose long-term career goal is to translate
prognostic research into clinical practice by designing and testing the effectiveness of intuitive clinical decision
support tools. This goal is predicated on the notion that applying novel biostatistical and machine learning (ML)
methodologies to increasingly available electronic health record (EHR) prognostic data can generate predictive
analytics and insights regarding disease risk. Clinicians can then use such insights for effective clinical decision-
making at point-of-care, including more proactive and personalized care, for improved patient-centered
outcomes. This is directly responsive to NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s strategic objective to
“Optimize clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease.”
To achieve his long-term goal, Dr. Owora will leverage his graduate training in biostatistics and epidemiology,
post-doctoral fellowship in the modeling of developmental origins of disease, as well as previous prognostic
research experience to transition to research independence as a translational scientist. To this end, he requires
additional training in how to apply novel biostatistical and ML methodologies to develop digital clinical decision-
support tools, and 2) implement and evaluate the efficacy of such tools in clinical settings.
This proposal describes a 4-year project to develop and determine the usability, acceptability, feasibility, and
preliminary efficacy of a childhood asthma Passive Digital Marker for early disease detection. Here, a Passive
Digital Marker (PDM) refers to a ML algorithm that can be used to retrieve and synthesize pre-existing
‘Passively’ collected mother/child dyad prognostic data (i.e., medical history) at ages 0-3 years in ‘Digital’ EHR
to provide an objective and quantifiable ‘Marker’ of a child’s asthma risk and phenotype at ages 6-10 years.
Proposed specific aims build on Dr. Owora’s ongoing prognostic research to: (1) develop and evaluate the
predictive performance of a childhood asthma PDM, compared to a Pediatric Asthma Risk Score (as a proxy for
standard practice), and (2) determine the usability, acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the
childhood asthma PDM among pediatricians.
To address these objectives, Dr. Owora proposes training activities that include didactic and experiential

My goal is to establish myself as an independent researcher on cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities with
expertise in Bayesian nonparametric clustering techniques and nutrition epidemiology. Attaining these
objectives will require focused didactic training and research guidance. My research goals are to develop new
methodology to identify temporal dietary patterns that are related to CVD risk of understudied and marginalized
subgroups. These new methods will identify dietary exposure differences that occur across populations in the
United States over time that otherwise may be overlooked. I will also develop methods to assess how these
temporal dietary exposure patterns impact CVD risk outcomes for adult women. With access to two NIH-
funded female cohort studies—the Black Women’s Health Study and the Nurses’ Health Study II —I will apply
the proposed methods to examine multivariate dietary exposure changes of US women over time and their
association with CVD health disparities, highlighting differences defined by racial/ethnic subpopulations.
Through implementation of the proposed methods and application to two large population-based cohorts, this
research will characterize the dietary behaviors of subgroups at greatest risk of CVD disparities and inform
future policies to improve dietary recommendations and promote population health equity. To achieve my
training goals, the proposed training plan consists of four elements: (1) a didactic component to expand my
expertise in nutrition and CVD epidemiology and disparities; (2) career guidance in methodological
development in repeated measures analysis of nutritional data of large, diverse populations; (3) innovative
research using gained content expertise in nutrition and CVD epidemiology and previous statistical training;
and (4) exchange of ideas in biostatistics, nutrition epidemiology, and CVD disparities through attendance at
conferences, seminars, and workshops. Planned training activities will enhance my understanding of dietary
consumption behaviors, CVD epidemiology, and disparities enabling me to develop useful models to measure
multivariate dietary exposure patterns over time and CVD risk estimation for vulnerable populations. The skills
and experience developed during this award period will prepare me to lead an interdisciplinary research
program addressing factors associated with cardiometabolic health disparities."

Food allergy (FA) has become a public health concern, affecting a sizeable segment of the population. Despite
the alarming increase in its prevalence, efforts to contain the FA epidemic have been stymied by the limited
understanding of disease pathogenesis, especially the role in this process of early life gut dysbiosis. In that
regard, our studies have established a critical role for immunomodulatory Clostridiales and Bacteroidales species
in enforcing immune tolerance to FA by inducing the differentiation of RORgt+ Treg cells, which act to suppress
FA. Early life expansion of RORgt+ Treg cells is induced by the bloom in Clostridiales and Bacteroidales species
during weaning from maternal milk to solid food. This expansion is counter-regulated by resistin-like molecule
beta (RELMb), which is elevated in FA subjects and mice. Accordingly, the focus of this proposal is to elucidate
the mechanisms by which early life dysbiosis promotes FA and its long-term implications in terms of disease
persistence and response to microbial therapy. We hypothesize that the microbial and immunological changes
ushered by weaning early in life provide a window of opportunity for tolerance induction to solid food in a process
regulated by RELMb, whose dysregulation by dysbiosis promotes FA (Aim 1). We also hypothesize that the
ineffective differentiation of RORgt+ Treg cell populations and the reciprocal emergence of Th2 cell-like Treg
cells, an imbalance we have identified to play a fundamental role in FA, acts to promote disease pathogenesis
by licensing IgE anti-food and anti-bacterial antibody responses (Aim 2). Finally, we hypothesize that products
and metabolites of individual immunomodulatory bacterial strains, including Toll-like receptors activators, aryl
hydrocarbon receptor ligands and secondary bile acids, act to enforce oral tolerance in FA by promoting RORgt+
Treg cell differentiation (Aim 3). The proposed studies will provide fundamental new insights relevant to the
pathogenesis of FA and offers novel opportunities in early life disease intervention and therapy."

Physical inactivity is a public health priority for older Latinos with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI,
considered the pre-dementia stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), increases the risk of developing AD and
related dementias (ADRD). A recent review suggests that physical activity enhances cognition indirectly by
improving health behaviors such as sleep and by reducing chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease
that affect neurocognitive function. Older Latinos, the fastest growing ethnic minority group in the United
States., experience a disproportionate burden of cognitive disease, including MCI, and ADRD, due in large part
to higher rates of inactivity and sleep-wake disturbances that are associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome,
diabetes, and cardiovascular risk. Latinos are often identified as one of the most sedentary of the older
racial/ethnic groups and experience significant multi-level barriers to physical activity – including cost,
environmental/neighborhood and safety concerns [especially if “engaging (i.e., walking) alone”], and lack of
social networks. Yet, the majority of physical activity interventions have not been designed for older Latinos
with MCI. Our proposed intervention study, “Tiempo Juntos para la Salud” (Time Together for Health) is guided
by a socio-ecological framework that includes multilevel strategies: empowerment education for behavior
change and individual motivation, building a social support network, and promoting cultural and
community resources for safe walking. We will use a randomized controlled trial design to assess the impact
of Tiempo Juntos on the primary outcome of moderate-intensity physical activity; theoretically grounded
mediators; and secondary outcomes of cognitive function, CV health, and sleep at 3, 6, and 12 months among
216 Spanish language-dominant Latinos aged 55 and older with MCI [Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
score ≥ 23 to 26 for Latino populations]. Participants randomized to Tiempo Juntos will receive a 1-hour, group
walking intervention, designed by and tailored to older Latinos, delivered twice weekly for 3 months by a
trained community health worker (CHW), and followed by bi-weekly, mobile health (mHealth) booster sessions
in Months 4-6. Participants randomized to Attention Control will receive Spanish health education adapted from
the National Institute on Aging online resources for older adults and including topics recommended by
community focus groups in preliminary research. Findings from this study will lay the essential groundwork for
a Stage IV, pragmatic trial of Tiempo Juntos in senior community settings serving Latinos throughout the
United States."

 The putative nucleotide sensor ZBP1 can trigger necroptotic cell death or transcriptional responses,
and genetic studies indicate that this pathway is required for host defense against an array of viral pathogens.
Furthermore, recent studies show that in some circumstances ZBP1 can become activated under sterile
conditions, implicating endogenous cellular products as potential ZBP1 ligands. However, despite long study,
the ligand responsible for activating ZBP1 and its interplay with other components of the nucleotide sensing
machinery remain controversial, with double-stranded RNA, ribonucleoprotein, and viral Z-form nucleic acid
species all suggested as ligand. ZBP1 shares its key nucleotide sensing domain with only one other
mammalian protein, ADAR1. ADAR1 inactivates endogenous dsRNA species to limit autoinflammatory
pathology, and mutations in ADAR1 in human patients lead to the severe autoimmune disease Acardi-
Goutieres syndrome (AGS). We hypothesize that ADAR1 and ZBP1 compete for a common endogenous
ligand, whose inactivation by ADAR1 is required to limit ZBP1 activation. In support of this idea, the pathology
observed in a newly-developed mouse model of human ADAR1 mutation was fully rescued by ablation of
ZBP1. This finding supports our hypothesis, and also implies that autoimmune pathology associated with loss
of ADAR1 function is caused by activation of ZBP1-dependent inflammation and cell death. Using these
observations as a starting point, the work proposed here will investigate ZBP1 activation and function by
pursuing three Aims: First, we will use ADAR1 mutation and additional new mouse models to facilitate
isolation and identification of an endogenous ZBP1 ligand. Second, we will assess the contribution of
necroptosis as well as ZBP1-mediated inflammatory signaling to the pathology of an animal model of human
AGS triggered by ADAR1 mutation, and test the ability of necroptosis inhibitors to ameliorate this pathology.
Third, we will investigate the role of other dsRNA sensors, including MDA5 and PKR, to ZBP1 ligand formation
and necroptotic pathway activation. Together this work will both reveal key aspects of ZBP1 function, and
identify ZBP1-dependent necroptosis as a potentially treatable target to ameliorate AGS."

Chemoenzymatic synthesis of bacterial nonulosonic acids and glycans
Sialic acids are a family of wide-spread nonulosonic acids (alpha-keto acids with a nine-carbon backbone) in
vertebrates and in some pathogenic bacteria. Bacteria also produce nonulosonic acids that have not been
found in animals. These bacterium-specific nonulosonic acids have been used by bacteria as part of their
capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) which are bacterial virulence factors and
potential vaccine candidates. Structurally defined bacterial CPSs, LPSs, and the corresponding
oligosaccharide repeating units are important probes to study their roles in bacterial infection and microbe-host
interaction including their influence on host immune systems. These carbohydrates are attractive synthetic
targets but pose significant synthetic challenges. In addition to bacterial specific nonulosonic acids, they may
contain other monosaccharide building blocks that have not been found in mammals. The glycosidic linkages
found in bacterial polysaccharides are also much more diverse than those in mammalian glycans. We propose
to develop efficient chemoenzymatic methods to synthesize bacterial nonulosonic acids and their glycans as
part of CPS and LPS oligosaccharides of pathogenic bacteria. These represent biologically important and
synthetically challenging targets. In the current proposal duration, the focus will be on bacterial glycans
containing legionaminic acid and their derivatives. Three specific aims are: 1, Synthesize acceptors and
monosaccharide chemoenzymatic synthons for one-pot multienzyme (OPME) glycosylation systems; 2,
Identify and characterize candidate sugar-1-P kinases, UDP-sugar synthetases, and glycosyltransferases; and
3, Chemoenzymatic synthesis of bacterial polysaccharide repeating units containing legionaminic acid or
derivatives. The enzymes identified and the monosaccharides designed are important tools and reagents for
accessing synthetic challenging carbohydrates and glycoconjugates that are not limited to the targets
described in the proposal. The oligosaccharides produced are essential probes for better understanding the
important roles of bacterial polysaccharides. They are also candidates for synthesizing structurally defined
carbohydrate-protein conjugate vaccines to combat bacterial infections."
10763358,"Macrophages play important roles in tissue homeostasis, host defense, response to injury, tissue
repair, and resolution of inflammation. The long term goals of this project are to understand how
macrophage functional phenotypes are regulated to balance host defense and inflammation with
homeostatic functions that resolve inflammation and restore tissue integrity. An associated goal is to
therapeutically modulate macrophages to promote tissue repair while minimizing inflammatory pathology.
 Macrophages assume various phenotypes dependent on ontogeny, tissue-specific factors,
epigenetic programming, and (micro)environmental challenges. Inflammatory macrophages produce
cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 that are important for host defense and inflammation, while reparative and
pro-resolution macrophages produce suppressive and growth factors such as IL-10, VEGF and PDGF
important for tissue repair, wound healing and resolution of inflammation. Recent high dimensional analyses
using flow/mass cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) have revealed distinct macrophage
populations and functional phenotypes in different tissues and disease states.
 Wound healing typically progresses through inflammatory, tissue repair, and tissue remodeling
stages. Both inflammatory and repair phases, and a well-regulated balance and transition between them,
are important for effective wound healing. Excessive inflammation, such as occurs in chronic TNF-driven
inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), results in ineffective repair and chronic wounds.
Immune cells including macrophages play important roles in the first two phases of wound healing, and
modulation of macrophage function to improve tissue repair is an emerging therapeutic strategy.
 In the previous project period we investigated mechanisms of crossregulation between the
inflammatory factor TNF and the repair factor IL-4, using primary human macrophages and mouse models
of wound healing. While IL-4 suppressed components of the TNF inflammatory response, the two cytokines
synergized to induce genes associated with resolution of inflammation. The balance between an
inflammatory and reparative macrophage phenotype was regulated in part by SREBP transcription factors.
Myeloid inactivation or pharmacological inhibition of SREBPs accelerated wound healing. scRNAseq
identified novel macrophage populations induced by injury and associated with tissue repair. These data
provide insights into mechanisms that regulate the transition from inflammation to repair, and support our
overarching hypothesis that selective modulation of the immune system can be utilized to improve tissue
repair. In this project we will investigate mechanisms that regulate the balance and transition between
inflammation and tissue repair. We anticipate that our studies will yield insights that can be used to develop
novel therapeutic strategies to enhance wound healing and restore tissue function."
10763357,"Project Summary
Interleukin-2 is a potent T cell growth factor with crucial roles in both immunity and self-tolerance. Genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) in humans have shown that genetic variation at the IL2 and IL2RA loci influence
susceptibility to multiple immune-mediated diseases including allergic asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus,
and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), identifying this as a key molecular axis that controls immune activity.
However, mechanistic basis of disease risk for these polymorphisms is poorly understood. We have new
evidence that the cis-regulatory architectures of IL2 and IL2RA extend much further from the gene than
previously appreciated, encompassing regions harboring known disease-associated variants, and we
hypothesize that polymorphisms within these elements control the level and timing of IL-2 and IL-2RA expression
to control the balance of tolerance vs. inflammation. In this application, we propose a comprehensive screen for
potential cis-regulatory elements that interact with the IL2 and IL2RA genes using state-of-the-art epigenomic
approaches like ATAC-seq and Capture-C-seq. We will establish how these elements contribute to IL2 and
IL2RA gene expression using powerful, CRISPR/CAS9-based genome editing approaches. To study the impact
of disease-associated genetic variation at these regulatory elements on immune function in in vivo systems, we
will analyze the responses of genetically characterized subjects curated from the Benaroya Research Institute
biorepository, and create mice in which orthologous murine Il2 and Il2ra enhancer sequences have been
replaced with human risk alleles, assessing the disease susceptibility in models of allergic asthma, SLE and IBD.
Our studies will provide comprehensive maps of the transcriptional architecture of IL2 and IL2RA, insights into
the molecular basis for the genetic association of IL2 and IL2RA with autoimmune disease, and may guide the
design of new approaches for the treatment of organ transplant rejection and inflammatory disease."

Anxiety disorders such as panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) affect approximately 18% of the American population with a health care cost of more than $42 billion a
year, a significant burden to the US economy. Development and maintenance of anxiety disorders have been
attributed to persistent fear memories, inadequate fear extinction, and maladaptive avoidance behavior. Thus,
it is imperative to understand the neural mechanisms underlying aversive learning in order to be able to develop
efficacious treatments for these disorders. In this project, we will focus on understanding the involvement of the
insula, a brain region heavily involved not only in aversive learning in general but also processes determining
approach/avoidance behaviors. Specifically, using in-vivo single cell calcium imaging via miniscopes, we will
record activity patterns of insular single cell ensembles during fear learning when the aversive outcome
(footshock) is inescapable as well as when the aversive outcome is omitted (fear extinction; Aim1a) and when
it becomes escapable (avoidance learning; Aim1b). Finally, using a novel theoretical-computational approach
to functionally cluster fear learning single cell ensembles in the insula, we will predict whether mice will develop
extinction resistant fear or impaired avoidance learning (Aim2). Thus, in this proposal, we aim to investigate the
involvement of the insular single cell ensembles in aversive learning and develop a novel computational tool to
predict future maladaptive aversive learning phenotypes based on the neural signaling in the insula."

In previous NIH sponsored research we successfully tested the hypothesis that integrating structural and
mechanistic information into heteromultimeric VHH-based neutralizing agent (VNA) design facilitated
development of antitoxins with even greater efficacy and versatility. In this renewal proposal, we will apply these
findings to test the hypothesis that our designer VNA platform, which is rapidly responsive to new threats, will
permit development of highly practical, next-generation antitoxin and antiviral products that possess excellent
potencies in treating intoxications or viral infections and are effective against a broad range of natural pathogen
variants. Our research will focus on two pathogens that are major current threats which could benefit from next-
generation therapeutics: botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) and SARS-CoV-2. We propose two Specific Aims which
will be underway simultaneously throughout the five years of research. In Aim 1, we will develop a small pool of
antitoxin VNAs that protect against all subtypes of the three prevalent BoNT serotypes (A, B and E). BoNTs are
CDC Tier 1 select agents. However, the few available antitoxin treatments against BoNTs primarily derive from
large animal polyclonal antisera, such as the equine botulism antitoxin HBAT, which suffer from multiple
manufacturing and storage challenges. Our goal is to test the platform’s ability to produce highly practical VNAs
as a next-generation BoNT antitoxin product, likely delivered as RNA nanoparticles, which improves on the
potencies and natural variant specificities of the current HBAT antitoxin product and is rapidly responsive to
potential new BoNT threats. In Aim 2 we will develop a single VNA antiviral agent that protects against known
variants of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is the viral cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
A promising strategy for rapid development of a therapy is development of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies,
especially antibodies targeting the spike protein, for prophylactic or passive immunotherapies. However, novel
variants of SARS-CoV-2, which cause enhanced infection and transmission, have emerged, and more
dangerous variants are expected to evolve. Of immediate concern are variants that partially escape
neutralization by current Ab-based therapies and in vaccinated or previously-infected COVID-19 patients, leading
to reduced vaccine efficacy in certain areas with a high prevalence of these variants. We propose an mRNA-
based antiviral product that, once administered, elicits expression of a VNA with extremely high virus neutralizing
potency. The VNA will contain multiple covalently linked VHHs binding to conserved epitopes of the spike protein.
This approach will test the platform’s ability to develop a product that minimizes the risks of immune escape
through evolution and selection of clinical strains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1. If successful, this
technology platform could have broad applications in creating practical therapeutics for a wide variety of
emerging and potential pandemic viral infections, bioterror threat agents, and other infectious diseases."

Clinical and epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that exercise reduces the incidence and improves the
prognosis of numerous types of cancer; however, the mechanisms by which exercise exerts its anti-cancer
effects remain poorly understood. Most exercise studies have been performed in breast cancer; however, as
breast cancer is obesity-associated, insulin-driven, and only weakly immunogenic, it is likely that exercise may
work differently in cancer types that are strongly immunogenic and not associated with obesity. A mechanistic
understanding of how exercise slows tumor growth is important because it will inform the design of clinical trials
to determine which exercise regimens are most likely to benefit a particular tumor type based on a patient's
clinical characteristics, allowing an exercise prescription to be made using precision medicine approaches.
Arguably more importantly, studies in this vein may reveal new therapeutic targets for lung cancer by modulating
metabolism in combination with standard-of-care treatments. In this proposal, we will examine how exercise
slows lung cancer growth in mice, with the Overarching Hypothesis that the beneficial effects of exercise on
lung cancer progression result from a combination of systemic metabolic interactions linking muscle to the
immune system to the tumor. We anticipate that exercise both reduces tumor glucose uptake, and increases
immune cell glucose and fatty acid metabolism, thereby enhancing T cell activation, and preventing exhaustion.
These hypotheses will be tested using a complement of tissue-specific knockout mice, methods that we
developed to model tissue-specific substrate metabolism, and multiple exercise modalities mimicking low-
intensity exercise as well as high-intensity interval training. In so doing, we anticipate generating new insights
into how muscle-tumor-T cell interactions mediate the beneficial effects of exercise in immunogenic tumors, and
may identify new immunometabolic targets to enhance the efficacy of exercise, generating an evidence-based
exercise prescription for lung cancer in mice."

The proposal addresses the ongoing mental health crisis among adolescents by considering the overlooked role of wealth
and wealth deprivation in driving adolescent problem behaviors. The literature on economic disadvantage and behavioral
health has taken a myopic view of the economic circumstances that drive problem behaviors, focusing nearly exclusively
on income, while ignoring wealth (household assets minus debts). Wealth is distributed more unequally than is income with
roughly one-third of child households experience wealth deprivation. This study will be the first longitudinal study of a
diverse cohort of families that observes wealth, income, and adolescent development. With a socioeconomically and racially
diverse sample of youth (ages 13-15 years; N = 750) and their caregivers, this investigation has three aims. First it will
repeatedly measure (9 observations nested within individuals) family wealth from comprehensive sources and gain a more
accurate understanding of wealth inequality and net worth poverty over time across different SES, racial, and ethnic groups.
Second, it will probe how wealth interfaces with family income and income volatility and how these factors relate to problem
behaviors. Considering that the recent growth in wealth disparities has far outpaced income disparities, we believe it critical
to consider how wealth levels and deprivation relate to youth problem behaviors. Third, it will test multiple pathways
through which wealth may relate to adolescent problem behaviors. These include: 1) investments of time and money, 2)
caregiver and adolescent stress, 3) caregiver and adolescent expectations for the future, and 4) perceptions and
manifestations of social class. Examined collectively, the proposal contributes new knowledge and connects to NICHD
priorities by providing rich descriptive information as to how adolescents’ problem behaviors are shaped by family wealth
and how such experiences interface with other dimensions of family economic circumstances to contribute to adolescent
development. The project’s robust analysis of four developmental pathways will be crucial for informing prevention and
intervention efforts aimed at reducing problem behaviors and promoting children’s psychosocial functioning among
adolescents in families experiencing wealth deprivation."

Project Summary
 Gross chromosomal rearrangement (GCR) is a hallmark of cancer cells and the
cause of structural variant formation in genetic disorders. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
are a major source to induce GCR, but the details on how the DSB repair process leads to
genome instability in cancers and other genetic disorders remains elusive.
 Microhomologies are prevalent at chromosomal break junctions in cancer and other
human diseases, suggesting that microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is one major
player to mediate GCRs. Repetitive sequences are abundant, constituting about half of the
human genome, which raises the question of how recombination between repetitive
sequences is suppressed to prevent genome instability. In this proposal, we aim to
investigate the mechanisms underlying MMEJ and repeat-mediated recombination in
mammalian cells.
 We have established multiple EGFP-based DSB repair reporter systems, which
enable us to study different DSB repair pathways in mammalian cells. By using newly
established MMEJ reporters, we identified new players in the MMEJ pathway. We will
investigate how these MMEJ players regulate MMEJ to balance its usage and its mutagenic
consequences. We will also study the biological role of MMEJ in repairing replication-
associated DSBs and in coping with replication and oncogenic stress, and address how
MMEJ contributes to genome instability and the oncogenic process. Additionally, we will
determine the mechanisms of repeat-mediated recombination in causing deletions and
translocations, and study the role of heteroduplex rejection in preventing recombination
among divergent repeats. These studies will generate much-needed new knowledge to fill
the gap in our understanding of DSB repair mechanisms and the cause of genome
instability that is associated with the oncogenic process and other genetic disorders."
10766730,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The gut endoderm is the precursor tissue of the respiratory and digestive tracts, and their associated visceral
organs. In this project we will use a suite of state-of-the-art technologies to address fundamental questions
focused on mechanisms of mammalian gut endoderm cell lineage commitment and tissue morphogenesis, as
well as probing the developmental origin and fate of cells that comprise the gut endoderm, using the mouse
model.
Our previous studies have provided a paradigm-shift in our understanding of the origin and mechanism of
formation of the gut endoderm. Using fate mapping, live imaging and more recently single-cell transcriptomic
methods, we demonstrated that the gut endoderm of mice comprises cells of two distinct developmental
origins; embryonic definitive endoderm, and extra-embryonic visceral endoderm. The dual origin of the gut
endoderm challenges the prevailing view of germ layer formation in mammals which posits that endoderm,
along with mesoderm and ectoderm, derives solely from pluripotent epiblast. We have also shown that the gut
endoderm forms through a novel intercalation mechanism and identified SOX17 as a critical regulator of
this process.
The broad aim of this project is to use molecular, genomic, embryological and imaging techniques to
investigate fundamental open questions pertaining the origin, formation and fate of the gut endoderm in
mammals. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the dynamic cellular behaviors driving gut endoderm
morphogenesis. Specific Aim 2 will probe the mechanism(s) by which the SOX17 transcription factor drives
gut endoderm cell fate specification, tissue morphogenesis and communication between embryonic definitive
endoderm and extra-embryonic visceral endoderm cells as they form a congruent epithelium. Specific Aim 3
will determine whether descendants of extra-embryonic visceral endoderm cells persist throughout embryonic
development and whether they will ultimately contribute to the endodermal organs of the adult.
A rigorous understanding of the normal gut endoderm, encompassing its origin, formation and fate, will
underpin logical efforts to direct the differentiation of cells into endoderm identities, generate bona fide
endodermal organoids for development and disease modeling and screening, understand disease progression
and design new therapeutic strategies for these vital organ systems when they fail."

Protein sialylation is a post-translational modification produced by members of a family of sialyltransferases.
We recently discovered that the resulting sialic acid linkages are involved in the regulation of glycoprotein
abundance and function in an intrinsic homeostatic mechanism that is targeted by multiple pathogens.
Environmental factors are dominant in the origins of the human Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs) and
seasonal bacterial infections have been implicated. We therefore developed a mouse model of repeated
human food poisoning comprised of recurrent low-titer non-lethal gastric infections of the Gram-negative
bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (ST), a leading cause of human foodborne illness
worldwide. In this unique model, the ST pathogen was rapidly cleared by the host, however a progressively
severe and persistent colitis developed similar to Ulcerative Colitis (UC). We demonstrated that pathogenesis
was linked to the disabling of a protective mechanism in the host involving the anti-inflammatory Intestinal
Alkaline Phosphatase (IAP) glycoprotein enzyme produced by enterocytes. Recurrent ST infections resulted in
Toll-like receptor-4 (Tlr4) induction of neuraminidase (Neu) activity and host Neu3 abundance with nascent IAP
de-sialylation and endocytic degradation, thereby reducing IAP half-life, abundance, and function. IAP
deficiency was similarly acquired in mice lacking the ST3Gal6 sialyltransferase resulting in spontaneous colitis.
The disease mechanism in both cases was Tlr4-dependent and linked to reduced dephosphorylation and
detoxification of the lipopolysaccharide-phosphate produced by commensal bacteria of the colon. In humans,
similar modulation of IAP and Neu3 have been reported in colitis, and genetic deficiency of IAP causes colitis,
supporting the rationale for ongoing clinical trials of IAP augmentation and neuraminidase inhibition. However,
the key involvement of Neu3 remains to be established. Research proposed herein will directly test the role of
host Neu3 in the onset and progression of colitis among Neu3-null mice. In addition, the possibility that other
enteric Gram-negative pathogens similarly provoke IAP deficiency will be investigated with the development of
other recurrent non-lethal gastric infection models using related Gram-negative enteric pathogens including the
hypervirulent Salmonella enterica Choleraesuis serovar. We have recently measured elevated Neu activity and
Neu3 protein abundance in the colon during recurrent ST infection associated with the de-sialylation of Mucin–
2 (Muc2), the major glycoprotein component of the protective mucin barrier. The mechanism of erosion of the
mucin barrier in colitis remains unknown but plays a large role in pathogenesis. We have recently linked
erosion of the mucin barrier to reductions of Muc2 protein sialylation, likely by ST3Gal6. Remarkably, Neu
treatment increases Muc2 proteolysis with reduced Muc2 abundance. Research proposed herein will
determine the role of Muc2 sialylation by ST3Gal6 in generating and maintaining the protective mucin barrier.
Together these studies will provide important advances pertaining to the prevention and treatment of colitis."
10772980,"Glomerular endothelial cell (GEC) dysfunction is an early event in DKD which promotes the disease
progression. However, the mechanisms of GEC injury in DKD remain unclear. Thus, a better understanding of
the underlying processes of GEC injury is urgently required for the development of an early therapeutic
intervention. Recently, we developed a novel method of effective isolation of GECs from transgenic mice
expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) under the endothelium-specific Flk1 promoter (Fu J et
al. KI, 2018). We were able to sort GECs from these mice with or without DKD for RNA-seq. We also
performed single-cell RNA-seq of glomeruli isolated from these mice, which also allow us to compare the
transcriptome of GECs at the single cell level between diabetic and non-diabetic mice (Fu J et al. JASN, 2019).
From these studies, we found that many of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in diabetic GECs were
involved in the regulation of endothelial injury in early DKD. Among these, G-protein coupled receptor-56
(GPR56) was found to be highly upregulated in diabetic GECs. GPR56 codes for an atypical G protein-coupled
receptor and is also referred to as Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor G1 (ADGRG1). Expression of
Collagen III, a major ligand for GPR56, is also accumulated in diabetic kidney. GPR56 activates mainly
G12/13-mediated RhoA-ROCK pathway, which is known to mediate endothelial cell dysfunction in DKD. Like
other adhesion receptors, GPR56 also responds to shear stress, which is increased in GECs of diabetic
kidneys due to glomerular hyperfiltration. Our key preliminary observations are: 1) Recent single-cell RNA-seq
data confirm that GPR56 expresses predominantly in GECs in the glomeruli. 2) Both mRNA and protein
expression of GPR56 increase in human DKD and correlate negatively with eGFR, suggesting an important
role of GPR56 in human DKD. 3) GPR56 is upregulated in cultured GECs by high glucose and advanced
glycation endproducts (AGE). 4) Collagen III treatment suppressed eNOS phosphorylation and expression
through activation of GPR56. 5) GPR56 reduces eNOS phosphorylation likely through G12/13-mediated RhoA
pathway and inhibits eNOS expression via Gi-mediated inhibition of cAMP/PKA/KLF4 pathway in cultured
mGECs. 6) Knockout of GPR56 enhances eNOS and KLF4 expression in GECs and attenuated albuminuria
and glomerular injury in mice with DKD. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that GPR56 mediates
disease progression in DKD by increasing GEC injury. We propose to determine the role and mechanism of
GPR56 signaling pathway in diabetes-induced GEC injury in vitro in GECs treated with diabetic condition and
in vivo in mice with DKD. We believe that our studies will help us to determine whether GPR56 could be a
potential new target to treat DKD by targeting GEC injury. The principal investigator will learn the skills and
new techniques under the guidance of her mentoring team (Drs. John He, Ravi Iyenger, Weijia Zhang, Bi-sen
Ding, and Evren Azeloglu) and her consultants (Drs. Xianhua Piao), who have a very strong track record of
training postdoctoral fellows in transitioning into independent investigators."
10758962,"The long-term goal of this research is to identify SUDEP risk biomarkers and the brain-heart-lungs
pathways mediating SUDEP pathophysiology. People with epilepsy are 16 times more likely than the general
population to die suddenly for unknown pathological reasons; these deaths are classified as SUDEP and
represent the leading cause of epilepsy-related mortality. Predictive SUDEP risk biomarkers still do not exist and
the exact mechanisms and pathways involved are poorly understood. Overcoming these barriers would enable
accurate patient risk stratification and monitoring, and the development of effective preventive strategies.
 In this work, we propose to employ a new multidisciplinary bioengineering systems approach (termed
“inter-organ directed connectivity analysis”) to identify the type and nature of directional interactions between the
brain (electroencephalography), heart (electrocardiography), and lungs (plethysmography) that underlie
susceptibility to SUDEP and that could be utilized as reliable biomarkers of SUDEP risk, beginning with
examination of Kcna1 global knockout (KO) mice in Aim 1. We will measure how these dynamics change over
time when seizures occur and as the time to SUDEP approaches. Kcna1 global KO mice, which lack Kv1.1
channels, are one of the best characterized genetic channelopathy models of SUDEP, exhibiting essential
features of SUDEP observed in patients. In Aim 2, we will employ brain- and heart-specific Kcna1 conditional
KO (cKO) models and pharmacology to begin to identify the underlying biological basis of the observed
impairment of dynamics in the directional connectivities between brain, heart and lungs. In Aim 3, we will then
examine a different model of SUDEP due to sodium channelopathy, the Scn8aN1768D mouse, which carries a
gain-of-function mutation in Nav1.6 channels, to determine whether the same patterns of abnormal brain-heart-
lung connectivity can be generalized across models.
 We hypothesize that our analyses will reveal pathological functional interactions between the brain, heart,
and lungs that are associated with SUDEP susceptibility in mice. Such patterns of faulty brain-heart-lung
connectivity have translational potential as new and more reliable biomarkers for monitoring SUDEP risk and
disease progression in epilepsy patients, while also shedding light on potential pathophysiological mechanisms.
Evaluation of brain-heart-lungs connectivity across two accepted mouse models of SUDEP in this proposal will
lay the foundation for future clinical application of this bioengineering technique in epilepsy patients with the hope
of providing individualized SUDEP risk assessment that can be used to aid preventative strategies."
10781919,"Background: Cancers of the reproductive system, by their very nature, occur in a sexually dimorphic manner
and are influenced by exposure to reproductive hormones and dysregulated responses to sex steroids. The
contributions of estrogens to the pathobiology of most breast cancers and the positive impact of endocrine
therapies on outcome in this disease are well established. However, the incidence and long-term outcomes of
patients with a variety of non-reproductive cancers also demonstrate sexual dimorphism (e.g. lung cancer,
melanoma, glioblastoma and thyroid cancer). Whereas the mechanisms underlying these differences are
complex and multifactorial, established contributing factors are gender differences in smoking, sun exposure,
alcohol consumption, diet and occupational environments. Underappreciated are the contributions of sex
hormones themselves to the pathobiology of non-reproductive cancers. We have determined that cancer cell
extrinsic actions of estrogens/estrogen receptor-alpha (ERa) in the immune system and in the brain contribute
to tumor pathology in animal models of several different cancers. Estrogens facilitate the development of an
immune suppressive tumor microenvironment through direct actions on myeloid cells resulting in the attenuation
of T cell activation/function. Inhibition of ER action in specific loci in the brain, however, has the paradoxical effect
of increasing the growth of tumors from different tissues of origin. Understanding the cancer cell extrinsic
pharmacology of ER will inform how best to use existing endocrine therapies, be instructive as to approaches to
develop the next generation of modulators and enable the development of new drug combinations for the
treatment of breast and gynecological cancers and other cancers originating outside of the reproductive system.
Hypothesis: Maximal therapeutic efficacy of ER modulators for different cancers will be realized with the
development of interventions that achieve robust inhibition of cancer cell intrinsic actions of estrogens, exhibit
favorable effects on immune cell repertoire/function in tumors, and do not interfere with the homeostatic feedback
mechanisms in the brain that modulate the expression of processes that impact tumor biology.
Aims: (1) Define the mechanisms by which ER in tumor associated myeloid cells impacts tumor pathobiology.
(2) Define the mechanism(s) by which ER expression in the brain regulates processes which impact the growth
of tumors. (3) Evaluate therapeutic approaches to selectively target tumor cell extrinsic activities of ER.
Impact: The effectiveness of endocrine therapies for breast cancer and other estrogen-modulated cancers has
been limited by the focus on developing agents that target cancer cell intrinsic actions of ER/estrogens. By
defining the mechanisms by which ER regulates immune cell function, and how it regulates hypothalamic
activities that impact tumor biology in the periphery it will be possible to develop next generation ER modulators
optimized for favorable cancer cell intrinsic and extrinsic actions. Such therapeutics should have utility for the
treatment of ER-positive and -negative (reproductive and non-reproductive) cancers."

Migraine is one of the most common chronic pain conditions worldwide, but prevalence differs based on sex
and age, with prevalence of migraine being higher in females. In addition to female sex, family history of
migraine represents a further risk factor for migraine. However, the factors which contribute to or protect from
migraine onset remain uncharacterized, and it is not yet possible to predict whether an individual will
experience migraine onset, even among individuals with both risk factors. Thus, this study aims to investigate:
Aim 1 – identify the psychophysical and neural factors which can predict migraine onset in adolescent girls;
Aim 2a – determine the hormonal, psychophysical, and neural changes associated with migraine onset; and
Aim 2b – characterize the temporal relationships between hormonal, psychophysical, and neural changes
preceding vs. following migraine onset. Preliminary data support the use of psychophysical and neural factors
as predictors of migraine onset. In addition, changes in pain sensitivity and in the functional connectivity of the
amygdala are observed in patients with migraine and following changes in headache frequency, and thus
support the use of these assays for the investigation of longitudinal changes related to migraine onset. Study
participants will be healthy girls (age 10–13) with either a family history of migraine (Fam-His, N = 160) or with
no family history of migraine (No-Fam-His, N = 40). In this study, we will perform assessments of
psychophysical (pressure pain thresholds [PPT] and conditioned pain modulation [CPM]), neural (functional
connectivity [FC] of the amygdala), and hormonal (testosterone levels) factors at baseline, and at 1- and 2-year
follow-up time points. For all study visits, participants will also meet with a pediatric headache/pain specialist to
determine whether or not they meet the diagnosis criteria for migraine (participants meeting diagnosis criteria
at baseline will be excluded from the study). We hypothesize that a pre-existing pronociceptive
psychophysical (lower PPT and lower inhibitory capabilities) and neural (greater FC between the right-
amygdala and posterior cingulate cortex) profile at baseline will predispose Fam-His girls to migraine onset
during adolescence and can be used to predict this onset. We expect that after 2 years, Fam-His girls
diagnosed with migraine will have distinct psychophysical, neural, and hormonal changes as compared to
those with no migraine onset and No-Fam-His girls. Moreover, we predict that lower increase in testosterone
levels will precede migraine onset, while further transition towards a pronociceptive profile will be observed
after migraine onset (reduction in PPT and CPM responses, and increase in amygdala FC). Early identification
of individuals most likely to be diagnosed with migraine will facilitate the development of a precision medicine
approach, allowing for the implementation of early preventive strategies, thereby reducing patient burden and
healthcare system costs. In addition, identifying the sensory, neural, and hormonal mechanisms associated
with migraine onset will be foundational to the development of novel migraine treatments."

Soluble α-klotho (“Klotho”) has systemic effects in maintenance of cell health including reduction of oxidative
stress and fibrosis in the heart and kidney. Kidney tubules are the primary source of circulating (soluble) klotho
and therefore the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) results in klotho deficiency. Klotho deficiency
may also paradoxically contribute to CKD progression. Rodent models of klotho deficiency display vulnerability
to kidney injury and progression of kidney disease, while administration of exogenous klotho attenuates kidney
damage and disease progression. Klotho deficiency may also contribute to excess cardiovascular disease
(CVD) risk in CKD as klotho knockout mice display vascular calcification and pathological cardiac remodeling
with cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Further, blood pressure (BP) may influence klotho levels as preclinical
data show that multiple models of hypertension all result in klotho deficiency. Thus far, the majority of clinical
studies examining soluble klotho have relied primarily on a single commercial source of ELISA. There are
concerns about the performance and reproducibility of this assay as the clinical data have been inconsistent.
Some studies have reported no relationship or higher levels of soluble klotho with reduced kidney function,
while others have shown a parallel decline in klotho and kidney function. This discrepancy has hindered
widespread measurement of klotho in large-scale human studies and has led to a paucity of quality data
examining the role of klotho in human CKD. Similarly, there are no longitudinal data on changes in klotho over
time in CKD. In a pilot project using samples from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) we
compared the most widely used commercial ELISA with an immunoprecipitation-immunoblot (IP-IB) assay, and
found that the IP-IB assay exhibited superior performance. Subsequently, we hope to address the current lack
of high quality human studies examining soluble klotho as a risk factor for CVD and CKD progression. SPRINT
is the ideal cohort to answer these questions as the trial enrolled 2646 participants with CKD and has detailed
CVD and kidney outcomes. This cohort is also well-suited to examine the patient-specific and disease-specific
clinical factors that may impact longitudinal changes in soluble klotho including: the intensive vs. standard
blood pressure control intervention, measures of mineral metabolism including FGF-23, and measures of
kidney tubular injury/health. We propose to measure baseline serum and urine klotho concentrations in 2646
SPRINT participants with CKD at baseline as well as in a pre-specified subset of 1000 persons at year 1 and
year 4 to: 1) compare the IP-IB assay with the commercial klotho ELISA; 2) determine the association of klotho
with CVD events, death, and CKD progression; and 3) identify the clinical factors that influence longitudinal
changes in klotho including intensive vs. standard BP control, markers of mineral metabolism and/or kidney
tubular health. Such data can collectively set the stage for future klotho interventional trials, inform clinical risk-
stratification models and provide a foundation for translational research in klotho biology and therapeutics."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is profoundly affected by the intestinal immune system and the intestinal microbiome,
which can exert both pro- and anti-cancer effects that operate alongside cell-intrinsic mutational events. Immune
cells produce reactive molecules and cytokines which contribute to epithelial mutagenesis and proliferation, and
immune cells infiltrate developing tumors and influence response to chemotherapy and anti-tumor
immunotherapy. Therapeutically modulating the immune system holds potential for transforming CRC outcomes,
but such interventions must be precisely targeted to specific signaling pathways, immune cell types and, ideally,
delivered locally. One promising source for such precision immunomodulatory targets are metabolites produced
by the intestinal microbiome, which have recently been shown to exert powerful effects on specific immune cell
types in the intestine. Exploiting the therapeutic potential of microbial metabolites requires: 1) basic knowledge
of the diet-microbe-metabolite-immune signaling network, 2) safe and effective means for localized metabolite
delivery, and 3) validated targets for defined therapeutic contexts. In this proposal, we will address these three
key gaps, with a unifying focus on a key population of anti-inflammatory T cells in the intestine: RORgt+ regulatory
T cells (RORgt+ Tregs). In Aim 1, we will dissect the mechanism of a previously unknown microbome-metabolite-
immune pathway by which the microbiome and dietary tryptophan regulate intestinal RORgt+ Treg populations.
In Aim 2, we will engineer a probiotic strain of E coli to serve as a general platform for localized delivery of
therapeutic metabolites; our initial goal will be to boost RORgt+ Tregs by overproducing the short-chain fatty acid
butyrate. In Aim3, we will evaluate the efficacy of elevating RORgt+ Tregs (via dietary butyrate) on key outcomes
for sporadic vs colitis-associated CRC in vivo. This project will deepen our understanding of metabolic
immunoregulation, develop novel probiotic strains for therapeutic metabolite delivery, and evaluate the role of
an important anti-inflammatory cell type in CRC."

Two hallmarks of Alzheimers Disease are accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular
neurofibrillary tangles, which disrupt brain function. Recent evidence indicates that dysfunction of cerebral
vasculature and immune cell hyperactivity also play key roles in AD progression. There is no suitable in vitro
model that reliably replicates the physiopathology or interaction of the neuro-gliovascular-immune system in
humans. In addition, neither brain slice-based assays nor animal models replicate the full spectrum of human
neuropathology and associated gliovascular-coupled inflammatory characteristics of AD. Early-onset familial
AD (FAD) is a useful and representative model for studying various aspects of AD, since it is caused by a
mutation in one of at least three knowns genes, presenilin 1, presenilin 2, and amyloid precursor protein (APP).
We have developed a FAD-Brain MicroPhysiological System (FAD-BMPS) to model both healthy and FAD-
relevant neuronal tissue with brain-derived extracellular matrix (ECM), and have tested the generation of
essential pathological features and hallmarks of AD. In a pilot study, we established a neuro-gliovascular-
immune unit of healthy BMPS by integrating neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells into two
separate tissues: brain tissue and a membrane-free blood vessel. Our proof-of concept study also
demonstrated the feasibility of AD hallmark generation and its impact on vascular and inflammatory responses.
We propose to develop a 3D membrane-free microfluidic FAD-BMPS and to validate AD physiopathology by
integrating 1) patient iPSC-derived FAD neuronal tissue with patient-derived ECM, 2) a microfluidic-based
membrane-free gliovascular system, and 3) resident and circulating immune cells. We will use FAD-neurons
and study AD hallmark generation, including phosphorylated tau deposit in neural cell and amyloid beta
accumulation in the patient-derived extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as amyloid beta transport, absorption,
and its mediated toxicity. We will compare gliovascular dysfunction and overactive inflammatory response in a
FAD-BMPS with those from a healthy BMPS, assess AD pathology exacerbation, and test the efficacy of
existing and investigational drugs in ameliorating FAD. This innovative project will combine the elegance of
microfluidics-based high-throughput and high-content imaging capability with the complex interactions of brain
tissue in AD. The most critical aspect of this study is employing a membrane-free neuro-gliovascular-immune
system in a reproducible manner that can be generally applied to AD, providing realistic and clinically relevant
data, and offering a platform for drug screening and personalized medicine. The PI Yeohung Yun, a
bioengineer at NC A&T State University with considerable experience with brain microphysiological system
development, is supported by a team of clinicians and stem cell scientists. If successful, this BMPS will serve
as a platform for modeling AD, reducing animal use, filling the scientific gap between in vitro and in vivo
models, and accelerating drug screening and discovery."

Naive B cells expressing low affinity antigen-receptors (BCRs) are activated by antigens (Ags),
and enter germinal centers (GCs) where hypermutation of BCR gene rearrangements (SHM)
drives selection for higher affinity mutants (affinity maturation). Specialized T cells, TFH, also
enter GCs and are the agents of high-affinity selection. Inferences regarding the fates of GC B
and T cells after influenza immunization or infection have been largely indirect. We will follow
the fates of GC T and B cells directly by immunizing or infecting S1pr2CreERT2-RFPLSL mice. In
this strain, GC B and T cells (and their progeny) can be labeled by giving mice Tamoxifen. This
conditional marking will allow us to follow the fate decisions of GC B cells: whether they become
antibody (Ab)-secreting plasmacytes (PCs) or quiescent memory B cells (Bmem). On re-exposure
– boost immunizations or secondary infections – we can then follow the roles of primary post-
GC B and T cells (RFP+) or newly recruited cells (RFP-) in the secondary responses. This
analysis will be important for understanding “imprinting” by influenza HA and NA Ags, the
persistence of Bmem cells at local and distal sites, and the persistence of long-lived PC in the
bone marrow. The results of this research will also be important for understanding the
evolutionary “arms race” between host immunity and mutating virus -- a major issue for vaccine
development and for understanding the fundamental biology of humoral responses to variant
pathogens."
10839319,"Project 3: Formulation and Delivery of Multifunctional Glycan Vaccines
Project Summary
 Virus-like particles (VLPs) are highly effective carriers of small-molecule structures that stimulate the
immune system’s response to such epitopes. VLPs have repetitive structures and package TLR-activating
RNA, are amenable to chemical and genetic modification, and are large enough to display different functional
molecules in a manner that allows them to effectively their cellular targets. Our laboratories have developed
Qb and PP7 capsid proteins for this purpose, learning the rules for effective glycan display to elicit the
production of affinity-matured antibodies. We now seek to go beyond the limitations of previous designs by
engaging various mechanisms of antigen presenting cell uptake, processing, and presentation, and by
delivering VLP-based vaccines over extended periods of time to take advantage of feedback amplification of
germinal center maturation by continuous antigen exposure. Exploratory studies will use a representative
Staph. aureus trisaccharide conjugated to a robust class II peptide as the displayed unit, arraying this motif
on VLPs engineered to simultaneously present ligands for DC-SIGN, Fcg receptors, or complement receptors
known to enhance B cell response to peptide immunogens. We will also explore the recruitment of immune
cells by the display of the natural antigen rhamnose as well as the release of glycopeptide or stimulatory
molecules carried in the interior of the VLP. Simultaneously, we will develop and test a new class of
degradable hydrogel materials that can be programmed to release vaccines over different periods of time.
The outcome of this ambitious program should be a highly optimized and modular vaccine delivery platform
that will be immediately applied to the generation of high-affinity antibodies against drug-resistant bacterial
pathogens that pose immediate and long term threats to human health."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by the novel viral
pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Of the 10%-20% of COVID-19
patients hospitalized, approximately 1/3 develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). COVID-19-
induced ARDS results from a combination of virally induced lung injury and the rapid influx of immune cells that
release inflammatory mediators leading to a hyper-activated state known as cytokine storm. Understanding the
pathophysiology of COVID-19 ARDS is critical to finding effective therapeutic interventions. Accumulating
evidence indicates critical roles for neutrophils in both ARDS and immunothrombosis in COVID-19. Multi-omics
studies identified dramatic neutrophil heterogeneity in COVID-19, including emergence of a large number of
low density neutrophils (LDN). We reported a novel population of LDN present in both the circulation and lungs
of severe COVID-19 patients which expresses intermediate levels of CD16 (CD16Int LDN). CD16Int LDN
spontaneously form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), activate platelets in vivo and in vitro, and have
heightened degranulation. Our preliminary data show that LDN subsets from severe COVID-19 patients are
functionally distinct from mature, normal density neutrophils (NDN). Based on these findings, we postulate
that differential functional responses of heterogeneous neutrophil populations collaborate to induce
systemic and pulmonary inflammation leading to ARDS in COVID-19 patients. Three specific Aims are
proposed to further dissect the underlying mechanisms. Aim 1 will comprehensively characterize neutrophil
subsets from severe/critical COVID-19 patients using proteomics and transcriptomics approaches. The
information gained from those studies will be used to refine our CyTOF antibody panel and prospectively
measure dynamic changes of neutrophil subsets over the disease course in COVID-19 patients. Aim 2 will
determine neutrophil subset functional changes during disease progression and their contributions to
dysregulated inflammatory response and coagulopathy in severe/critical COVID-19 patients. Neutrophil
degranulation, NET formation, phagocytosis, chemotaxis, T cell suppressive activity, and cytokine/chemokine
release will be examined. We will also determine if LDN subsets and NDN or their derived products promote
coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients. Aim 3 will determine the relative contributions of neutrophil host defense
systems to development of acute lung injury. We will also use a hACE2 Tg mouse model to determine the
roles of neutrophil respiratory burst, granule exocytosis, and NET formation to SARS-CoV-2-induced acute
lung inflammation. Successful completion of this proposal will provide novel insights into COVID-19-induced
ARDS pathophysiology by defining the functional roles of different neutrophil subsets and by establishing
which host defense systems of neutrophils as a therapeutic target for inhibiting inflammatory lung injury and
immunothrombosis in COVID-19."

Ventricular arrhythmias remain the leading cause of death in patients with cardiomyopathy and account for up
to 300,000 deaths per year in the United States. However, the current classifications of these rhythms is based
largely on whether the cardiomyopathy is due to obstructed coronary arteries and poorly stratifies patient
response to therapy, arrhythmic risk, and pathophysiology.
The goal of this project is to develop an actionable classification scheme for ventricular arrhythmias in patients
with cardiomyopathy that is based on the interplay between both structural and electrical abnormalities
measured from each patient’s heart. Such a classification, based in measurements of pathophysiology, would
inform the clinical approach to risk assessment, interventional therapies, and medications.
The proposal outlines three Specific Aims: 1) To identify electrical fingerprints of endocardial, mid-myocardial
and epicardial scar using machine learning of endocardial high-density contact electrograms trained to the
ground truth of regional delayed gadolinium fibrosis on magnetic resonance imaging, from our large patient
registry. 2) To develop and validate a mapping strategy that could be used at clinical electrophysiology to
measure ventricular refractory period, a measure of electrical remodeling that indicates ability to sustain VA, by
machine learning of high density electrical signals from the heart of a porcine model labeled by repolarization
indices from the gold standard, simultaneously recorded, monophasic action potentials. And 3) To derive novel
phenotypes of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy in patients with VA based on regional distributions of fibrosis
and electrical remodeling, and associate these with acute response to ablation and recurrence in a well-
characterized patient registry.
To successfully complete the proposed project, training objectives include 1) advanced MRI processing and
segmentation, 2) machine learning models for multimodal data analysis, 3) translational interventional
procedures, and 4) translational clinical electrophysiology. The proposed NHLBI K23 award will provide
protected time for the candidate to obtain this advanced training, to disseminate new knowledge via written and
spoken communication, and to build the foundation for an independent research program focused on
ventricular arrhythmia diagnosis, prevention, and therapy in a supportive environment of established
mentorship, collaborators, and interdisciplinary experts spanning engineering and medicine."

 In this single group study of 33 persons with Parkinson's Disease (PD, Hoehn and Yahr Stages II-III) will
exercise in two virtual reality augmented bicycling conditions: visual feedback and competition. The primary
purpose of the study is to determine which condition of bicycling (visual feedback or competitive) promotes a
higher exercise intensity in the neuromusculoskeletal domain (measured by revolutions per minutes on the
bicycle) and in the cardiovascular domain (measure by % of max. heart rate) as well as which promotes higher
motivation and enjoyment (measured with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory) and reduced perception of effort
(measured with the Borg Scale). The secondary aims are to explore how personal factors (competitiveness)
influence the exercise intensity, and whether visual attention can differentiate between the cycling conditions.
Data will be collected in a single session consisting of clinical assessments and bicycling for ten minutes for each
condition while wearing a head mounted display to interact with the virtual environment.
Results from this study will inform the design of optimal exercise programs to make exercise accessible,
enjoyable for persons with PD. Those programs will be tested for efficacy at improving mobility and fitness
leading to well-being for persons with PD.
 The proposed project will be undertaken in a well-equipped laboratory under the mentorship of a sponsor
with a long track record of designing virtual reality tools for persons with neurologic health conditions. The
sponsor has successfully mentored dozens of graduate students including dual-degree students, training to be
clinician scientists. Collaborators and contributors from diverse training backgrounds and areas of expertise will
work with the sponsor and PI on this project. The PI will couple his previous training in engineering with new
skills developed in applied science. The PI's training plan includes goals related to research execution and
dissemination, clinical experience, teaching/mentoring, and community/professional service all of which can be
realistically achieved."
10765681,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aging is the strongest risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. Targeting fundamental aging mechanisms
offers promising new strategies to counter brain dysfunction. Recent breakthroughs have demonstrated that
proteins in aged blood circulation mechanistically contribute to accelerated brain aging, and senescent cells
(SCs) accumulate in aging and may drive tissue deterioration, in part, through the proinflammatory senescence
associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This research is designed to test whether progeronic SASP
proteins produced by systemic SCs mechanistically contribute to accelerated brain aging through
blood circulation. This premise is based on published findings establishing that aged blood circulation and/or
direct administration of progeronic plasma proteins that are putative SASP factors are sufficient to transfer an
accelerated aging phenotype to young mouse brain and our research demonstrating that systemic SC
clearance attenuates the SASP in circulation, which is associated with improvements in brain inflammatory
parameters and cognitive decline. To test our central hypothesis, we will combine circulatory exchange
methods with mouse models in which SCs can be eliminated or production of the SC proteome can be
precisely monitored, which will enable us to study whether reducing the circulating SASP is sufficient
to ameliorate the adverse influence of aged blood on brain homeostasis. We will develop an innovative
transgenic mouse model that will enable bioorthogonal labeling of the nascent p16+ SC proteome. This will
empower our discovery of the age- and tissue-specific p16+SC-proteome, its contribution to the
circulating progeronic proteome, and its responsivity to SC clearance. Administration of bioorthogonally
labeled aged plasma +/- SC clearance to young mice will facilitate discovery of candidate SASP proteins
responsible for accelerated aging brain phenotypes for further mechanistic interrogation. Modifying aged blood
composition and targeting SCs are therapeutics actively being pursued for ameliorating age-related decline.
This project is designed to mechanistically synergize and advance these two promising concepts. Our research
may preclinically implicate systemic SC clearance as an option to deplete the progeronic influence of aged
blood, ultimately revealing a novel approach for treatment or prevention of age-dependent cognitive decline
and dementia."

Reducing morbidity and mortality due to invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is a global health priority, which can be
accomplished in part by improving the timely detection and management of cervical precancer. Precancerous
cervical lesions characteristically progress from low-grade to high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (from
CIN-1 to CIN-2/3). Low-grade CIN-1 can spontaneously regress to normal, persist over time, or progress to CIN-
2/3, but there is insufficient evidence to predict which CIN-1 cases will progress. Epigenetic alterations of DNA
sequences, such as methylation at cytosine-p-guanine (CpG) sites, have been observed in cervical precancer
and cancer. As such, methylation patterns have been proposed as potential biomarkers for the detection of high-
grade cervical lesions. However, their utility as predictors of cervical disease progression is limited, as few
studies have investigated the effect of methylation on the risk of progression from low-grade CIN-1 to high-grade
CIN-2/3. In addition, while high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to cause ICC, little is known about
the relationship between HPV infection and the host methylation patterns seen in cervical carcinogenesis.
Epigenetic studies incorporating longitudinal clinical data are needed to understand the effect of DNA
methylation on the risk of progression of HPV-associated precancerous cervical lesions.
This study will assess relationships between early-stage DNA methylation, high-risk HPV infection, and the
progression or persistence of CIN-1. The proposed research will utilize collected data from women in the Cervical
Intraepithelial Neoplasia Cohort Study (CINCS) with CIN-1 at enrollment, baseline methylation at 450,000 GpGs,
pertinent clinical and behavioral exposures, and one year of clinical follow-up data. Using this unique and robust
dataset, the Specific Aims of this proposal are to 1.) assess the effect of baseline DNA methylation on CIN-
1 progression/persistence in 151 women at one-year follow-up and 2.) assess the association between
baseline HPV infection status and DNA methylation in 151 women with CIN-1.
Study findings have the potential identify novel methylation markers of cervical disease progression, improve the
clinical management of low-grade cervical precancer, and contribute to our knowledge of HPV-related
carcinogenesis. Through the completion of these research aims, the applicant will gain a unique set of skills in
advanced epidemiologic methods and clinical research, including the analysis and interpretation of complex
epigenetic and longitudinal clinical data. Expert mentors in cancer and genetic epidemiology, methylation
analysis, statistics, and gynecologic oncology will support the applicant’s successful completion of the proposed
research, associated training plan, and MD-PhD degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This
F30 fellowship will critically aid the applicant’s development as a future interdisciplinary physician-scientist
practicing at the intersection of cancer care, epigenetics, and women’s health."
10771938,"The overarching goals of this proposal are to determine if Erbb3 kinase plays a critical role in colorectal
tumorigenesis and to test if colorectal cancer with oncogenic Erbb3 mutations respond better to anti-PD1
antibody. Erbb3, a member of the EGFR family of receptor protein tyrosine kinases, is mutated in a variety of
human cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC). Unlike other EGFR family members, the kinase domain of
Erbb3 is thought to be a pseudo-kinase without enzymatic activity. Although it is well documented that Erbb3
plays an oncogenic role in tumorigenesis, the mechanisms by which Erbb3 activation drives tumorigenesis are
largely unknown. We made the paradigm-shifting discovery that the pseudo-kinase domain of Erbb3 is a
serine/threonine (S/T) kinase activated by phosphorylation of a serine site in the juxatomembrane domain, and
that its kinase activity is required for robust tumor growth in both xenograft and genetically engineered mouse
models. Moreover, we found that a Erbb3 kinase-dead mutant impairs interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced PD-L1
expression in CRCs. Interestingly, knockin of an oncogenic Erbb3 mutation in mouse colon cancer cell lines
renders them sensitive to anti-PD1 antibody therapy. Here we propose two aims to determine the role of Erbb3
S/T kinase in (1) colorectal tumorigenesis and (2) the response of colorectal cancers to immune checkpoint
inhibitors. Successful completion of our proposed studies will lay a solid foundation for targeting Erbb3 mutant
CRCs with Erbb3 kinase inhibitors and/or immune checkpoint inhibitors. Given that aberrant activation of Erbb3
causes resistance to various cancer therapies including Herceptin in breast cancer and EGFR inhibitors in lung
cancer, the impact of our studies will have a broad impact on cancer therapy."
10804589,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
HIV remains a global threat despite the tremendous progress of combinatorial antiretroviral therapy (cART).
Chronic inflammation and immune activation support an increased risk of non-AIDS co-morbidities in cART-
treated HIV patients. This condition is attributed to various factors including antiretroviral (ARV) toxicity and
viral persistence in secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs) which has been linked to low ARV penetration in these
reservoir sites. Furthermore, uptake of daily antiretrovirals (ARVs) remains a burden resulting in poor
adherence that can lead to viral rebound from the SLTS. In this project, we propose to develop a long-acting
“stealth” nanoformulation composed of lipid wrapped poly-lactic acid nanoparticles (GM3-PLA-NPs) loaded
with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, Rilpivirine (RPV) and integrase inhibitor, Cabotegravir
(CAB). These GM3-PLA-NPs have innovative targeting and design features that will increase drug entry and
retention in SLTs, in addition to modulating inflammatory responses. Indeed, the membrane incorporated
monosialo di-hexosylganglioside (GM3) enables specific binding to the sialic acid lectin receptor CD169 on
myeloid cells (macrophages and dendritic cells), leading to the formation of non-acidic membrane
invaginations which can prevent NP degradation, and lead to long-term establishment of cellular drug depots.
These NP collecting compartments (NPCCs) are identical to the previously defined virus containing
compartments (VCCs) formed upon capture of HIV-1 by CD169. Since VCCs are also involved in myeloid cell-
mediated HIV transmission to CD4+ T cells (trans-infection) through the virological synapse, I hypothesize that
NPCCs could potentially promote sustained ARV release to bystander T cells through macrophage – T cell
synaptic junctions. Our preliminary data have demonstrated that these GM3-PLA-NPs are successfully
preserved in NPCCs of CD169+ macrophages over time which extended anti-viral potency in these cells for a
month in vitro. Subsequently, sustained viral inhibition in bystander Jurkat T cells was observed upon co-
culture with NP-exposed CD169+ macrophages. Additionally, our findings suggest that the GM3 lipid coating
confers “stealth” properties to suppress non-specific immune activation induced by loaded ARVs and
nanoparticle core. Thus, in aim 1, we will investigate the extracellular drug release mechanism from CD169+
macrophages to CD4+ T cells. In aim 2, we will assess the long-term toxicity and stealth mechanism of GM3-
PLA-NPs. Finally, we will confirm these results in vivo by assessing the spatial distribution and stealth
phenotype of GM3-PLA-NPs in SLTs in aim 3. These studies will elucidate a new approach for safe and
effective delivery of long-acting therapeutics to SLTs which could be beneficial for HIV prevention and
treatment as well as other diseases such as metastatic cancer."
10845506,"Controlling whether and when a pregnancy occurs is a human right. Yet, despite more than 40 years of the U.S.
Department Health and Human Services prioritizing the reduction of undesired pregnancies, rates remain high
[49]. This is at least in part because despite a great deal of research on this topic, we still have relatively little
understanding of why some women are able to get what they want in terms of pregnancy while others are not.
 This study takes an innovative approach to understanding this puzzle in two ways, which allow me to
overcome two persistent barriers to our understanding of undesired pregnancies. First, I apply a unique and
innovative theoretical framework—the Traits-Desires-Intentions-Behavior (TDIB) framework—that has been
largely neglected by demographers. The TDIB has great potential to contribute to our understanding of
undesired pregnancies because it was specifically designed for this purpose; it focuses on the potential
mismatches between desires and intentions, and between intentions and behaviors. Second, I use a unique
longitudinal, mixed-method study of 18- and 19-year-old women, the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life
(RDSL) study, which includes both prospectively measured pregnancy desires and semi-structured interviews
(n=75) with subsequently pregnant and non-pregnant respondents. The semi-structured interviews,
particularly the non-pregnancy interviews, remain almost entirely un-analyzed, and were designed specifically
to generate innovative new hypotheses and evidence about undesired pregnancies. First, we interviewed a
group of 40 RDSL respondents, (distributed evenly across white/Black and poverty/non-poverty groups) who
experienced pregnancies during the 2.5-year study period. (The vast majority were undesired.) Second, we
interviewed a comparison group (n=32) who were similarly distributed across race and poverty groups, but
who avoided pregnancy during the study period. Using a systematic anomalous case analysis strategy [75], an
abductive approach to generating new hypotheses with “surprising” (i.e., in this case, unpredicted by statistical
models) cases, we selected respondents with high model-based propensity for pregnancy, based on a hazard
model using the 2.5 years of survey data. We distributed these interviews across three additional groups, based
on survey responses: those with zero or non-zero pregnancy desire, one or multiple intimate partners, and
perfect or imperfect contraceptive use.
 I propose to use NVivo software and qualitative analysis techniques to analyze the semi-structured
interviews by comparing the pregnant and non-pregnant respondents who differ in terms of three domains:
pregnancy desires, intimate relationships, and contraceptive use. I will also compare pregnant and non-
pregnant respondents who match in terms of these domains, to generate and evaluate new hypotheses that do
not focus on these domains. Finally, I will use these analyses to further explicate and expand the TDIB
theoretical framework and disseminate it more widely to demographers."
10935942,"The project describes a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach to engaging
the Maine tribes in managing risks associated with environmental contamination. Each
community has expressed concerns about the health of their waters and quality of their
subsistence foods with particular concerns around Food Sovereignty, defined as “the right of
peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and
sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems.” Our
central hypothesize is that integrating CBPR and participatory science can be used to equip
tribal communities with the tools to manage and balance their risks associated with
contamination of water and subsistence foods. We aim to, 1. Build capacity for participatory
science amongst tribal youth by providing them the tools for sample collection and basic
contaminant monitoring, with more advanced analyses conducted in the University labs; 2.
Through collaborations between the Wabanaki Public Health and Wellness (WPHW), Tribal
Elders and other Indigenous Knowledge Keepers; traditional ecological knowledge (TEK)
around subsistence food consumption patterns and use of waterways for fishing and other
activities will be documented through recordings and other media; 3. TEK will be incorporated
into health risk assessments in order to support culturally appropriate risk communication and
risk management strategies for affected communities. WPHW will serve as a central repository
for this information, in order to ensure that it is readily accessible to all of Maine’s Tribes. The
ultimate goal of this project is to provide the capacity and training within tribal communities to
make informed decisions on the health of their traditional foods and waterways. This in turn will
provide the foundations for a larger program that will serve the environmental health needs of
Maine’s Tribal communities, while at the same time respecting and supporting food sovereignty
that can be sustainable over the longer term and in the face of a rapidly changing environment."
10809651,"Abstract
Excessive consumption of alcohol is a global problem and is the world’s third largest risk factor for diseases and
disabilities, and accounting for 5.9% of all deaths worldwide. Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a
spectrum of disease that starts with steatosis progressing to fibrosis and finally cirrhosis in ~20 to 30% patients
of in chronic excessive alcohol drinkers. However, rest of the 70-80% with alcohol use disorders (AUD) patients
may not progress into severe ALD. Therefore, we asked what are factors that potentially prevent AUD patients
to progress in to ALD. The composition of gut microbiota and their metabolites are significantly vary in ALD
patients compared to AUD and healthy subjects and play a critical role in manifesting ALD pathogenesis. Our
pilot studies in mouse of ALD showed that treatment with gut microbial metabolite Urolithin A (UroA) significantly
reduced ALD pathogenesis. UroA treatment decreased EtOH-induced gut permeability, hepatic steatosis and
hepatitis in chronic, chronic+binge ALD mouse models. UroA is a dietary microbial metabolite produced from
ellagitannin/ellagic acid-rich diets such as pomegranate, walnuts and berries. We postulate that harboring UroA-
producing bacteria in healthy or AUD subjects may prevent from developing severe ALD. In this exploratory
project, we will test the hypothesize that microbiota and their metabolites (urolithins) in healthy and AUD without
ALD differ from AUD patients with ALD, and presence of UroA-producing bacteria when combined with diets rich
in EA/ET or with direct supplementation of UroA will protect from ALD progression. To test this hypothesis, we
proposed two specific aims. In aim 1, we will collect stool samples from healthy, AUD and severe ALD patients
and determine their ability to produce UroA in vitro cultures. Next, we will generate humanized microbiota mice
(HMM) by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) of UroA-producing or non-producing stool samples (collected
from healthy/AUD/ALD subjects) in to germ free mice. In aim 2, these humanized microbiota mice (UroA
producers vs non-producers) will subjected to chronic+binge (10+1) ALD model and determine extent of ALD
development in these mice upon supplementing with EA. Further, we will test whether direct supplementation of
UroA mitigate severe ALD in these humanized microbiota mice. Upon successful completion of these studies,
we will determine whether UroA-producing microbiota and/or direct supplementation of UroA provides protection
against ALD in humanized microbiota mice. These studies would unravel potential of microbiota dependent
personalized dietary patterns to control ALD."
10796772,"Stargardt disease (STGD1) is the most common form of inherited macular dystrophy. The primary biochemical
defect in STGD1 is excessive formation of cytotoxic lipofuscin bisretinoids in the retinal pigment epithelium
(RPE) due to recessive mutations in the ABCA4 gene. There is no treatment for Stargardt disease. The major
cytotoxic components of RPE lipofuscin are pyridinium bisretinoids, which are formed as by-products of the
visual retinoid cycle. It was suggested that partial inhibition of the visual cycle may reduce the formation of
lipofuscin bisretinoids and prolong the RPE and photoreceptor survival in Stargardt disease. A critical step in
the visual cycle is the conversion of all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis-retinol by the enzyme called
isomerohydrolase (IMH). It has been shown that RPE65 represents IMH, which produces 11-cis-retinol from
all-trans-retinyl ester in the RPE. The IMH reaction is rate-limiting in the visual cycle function thus making
RPE65 an important drug target for the visual cycle inhibition. Pharmacological blockage of the visual cycle
accomplished by RPE65 inhibition was shown to effectively reduce bisretinoid production in the Abca4-/- mouse
model of Stargardt disease. However, direct RPE65 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy is complicated by the
severity of mechanism-based adverse effects (AEs), and it is unlikely that selective RPE65 inhibitors can be
used clinically at efficacious doses due to their excessive retinal toxicity. In order to reduce the levels of RPE65
inhibition below the threshold associated with AEs while maintaining a bisretinoid-lowering efficacy, we will
develop a class of novel bispecific compounds which in addition to RPE65 inhibition will act as retinaldehyde
traps. Retinaldehydes are direct bisretinoid precursors, and their neutralization through the formation of
reversible Schiff base or 1,3-oxazinane adducts using primary amine- or aminocarbinol-containing compounds,
respectively, would reduce bisretinoid synthesis. The use of bispecific compounds will allow to reduce the level
of RPE65 inhibition below the threshold associated with AEs while maintaining a combined bisretinoid-lowering
efficacy. Two novel non-retinoid compounds, RPE65-61 and RPE65-71, will serve as the starting points in
medicinal chemistry optimization of the new class of bispecific agents in studies related to Specific Aim 1.
Traditional ocular pharmacodynamic markers related to the inhibition of the visual cycle and suppression of the
rod ERG signal along with a new serum biomarker related to aldehyde trapping will be used to prove the in
vivo activity of bispecific compounds and to select the range of safe yet efficacious doses (Specific Aim 2).
Evaluation of in vivo efficacy along with the assessment of retinal toxicity after chronic dosing will be conducted
in the mouse genetic models of Stargardt disease (Specific Aim 3)."
10832971,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
Overweight and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the United States, proving to be a very difficult
health challenge for both patients and the physicians who care for them. Excess weight is a major contributor to
heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Addressing overweight and obesity in clinical visits is critical to
treating and preventing these obesity-associated diseases. However, Weight Management Counseling (WMC)
uptake is low, and physicians report lack of training as a critical barrier to WMC. Residency training is a crucial
time to influence physicians' current and future practice, yet there is no evidence-supported WMC curriculum for
residents. Informed by two pilot studies, MRWeight will use spaced-education to train residents to deliver WMC
using the 5As framework (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centered counseling. As such,
MRWeight will be delivered in short segments and spaced over 12 months using four components: didactic
session 1 – a discussion of WMC foundational concepts; 3Ps program (Prepare, Practice, Process) – an email
program using the Video-based Communication Assessment (VCA) to facilitate practice of challenging cases;
didactic session 2 – a discussion of key barriers to practicing WMC; and email reinforcement of concepts covered
in the preceding components. Each component, guided by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), is designed to build
on and reinforce the training provided by the other components. Using a pair-matched group randomized
controlled trial (RCT) including 8 Internal Medicine residency programs, we will test the MRWeight intervention
with 3 cohorts of postgraduate year 1 residents followed for 18 months. Comparison arm residents will be emailed
the PowerPoint of a foundational course on WMC, but unlike those in the Intervention, comparison sites will not
include the didactic sessions or the 3Ps program. Our aims are: Aim 1 will evaluate the effectiveness of the
MRWeight Intervention for increasing residents' WMC skills at 12 months; Aim 2 will evaluate residents' self-
reported adoption of WMC skills in their encounters with patients in clinical practice at 18 months; Aim 3 will
explore possible mechanisms (mediators) and moderators of the intervention's effect on Aim 1 and 2 outcomes
(residents' WMC skills and adoption). The study will be the first large trial to test a curriculum that has been
integrated into Internal Medicine residency programs for teaching WMC skills. The multi-PIs (Drs. Ockene and
Sadasivam) will build on 36-years of successfully conducting large, randomized trials to evaluate training
programs, including those that taught the 5As and patient-centered counseling for WMC, in 18 medical schools,
10 residency sites, and 10 primary care settings. This study is timely, given public health momentum strongly
advocating for physician training and involvement in WMC and the dissemination and implementation of clinical
guidelines for obesity treatment."
10752675,"SUMMARY
Treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) represents an unmet need in medicine. We have been pursuing a
therapeutic approach of delivering potent targeted and specific cytotoxins using continuously evolving
convection-enhanced delivery. Patients with GBM over-express interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13RA2),
EphA2, EphA3 and EphB2 receptors that are present in various pathophysiological compartments of GBM
and all four are expressed in tumor cells of the core of tumor, and in locally-infiltrating tumor cells, while EphA2
is also found in tumor neovasculature. Further, IL-13RA2, EphA2, and EphA3 are associated with, and play
crucial roles in, the pathobiology of glioma stem-like cells. Finally, the EphA3 receptor are found in M2 GBM-
associated macrophages. Thus, collectively, IL-13RA2, EphA2, EphA3 and EphB2 are over-expressed in
principal GBM compartments shown to be involved in tumor progression and/or resistance to therapies. In a
first-of-kind approach, we performed Phase I clinical trial in dogs with spontaneous gliomas, which represents
a faithful model of human disease, using a cocktail of cytotoxins targeting IL-13RA2 and EphA2 receptor. We
observed exceptional anti-tumor responses, including several near complete regressions, prolongation of
survival and excellent quality of life in this dose-finding trial, at no toxicity. In addition, we found evidence for
immune system activation during the therapy. Encouraged by these results, we pursued the novel idea of
targeting all four receptors instead of two with one pharmaceutical compound. One of the Eph receptor ligands,
ephrinA5 (eA5), binds EphA2, EphA3 and EphB2 receptors. We have thus generated an agent based on eA5
and IL-13 mutants targeting all four receptors using an IgG1 scaffold (QUAD). In our initial experiments, the
QUAD was conjugated to derivatives of Doxorubicin (Dox) or a derivative of Pseudomonas exotoxin A,
PE38QQR, to generate single pharmaceutical agents and these drug conjugates retained their binding
affinities towards the targeted receptors while demonstrating prominent killing activity on GBM cells. QUAD-
Dox and QUAD-PE38QQR conjugates have already shown prominent, long-lasting anti-tumor effects in dogs
with spontaneous glioma at no toxicity: 60, 88, and 91% of tumor volume regression in the treated dogs,
respectively. Recently, we have conjugated QUAD to DM1, a microtubule-disrupting agent. The QUAD-DM1 is
extremely potent on GBM cells with IC50s in low femtomolar range, ~50x better than the Dox/PE conjugates.
Therefore, we will continue this exciting line of research through Specific Aims as follows. In Specific Aim 1, we
will treat dogs with spontaneous newly diagnosed and recurrent high-grade gliomas with QUAD-DM1. In
Specific Aim 2, we will examine immune responses and the phenotype and genotype of recurring tumors in the
course of QUAD-DM1 therapy. Our approach addresses crucial issues of inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity
and evokes an in situ vaccination or so called “tumor inflaming” effect. We envision that this all-out assault,
termed by us “molecular resection”, will result in a more effective management of GBM."
10752647,"Vascular diseases continue to be a major cause of death in the US and worldwide. It has been proposed that metabolic
reprogramming and increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity and expression contribute to the
pathogenesis of fatal angioproliferative vasculopathies. Moreover, some studies suggest individuals with a loss-of-
function G6PD (Mediterranean or African) variant – S188F (G6PDS188F; Type A-; severe deficiency) or N126D
(G6PDN126D; Type A; mild deficiency) nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism – have lower frequencies of
coronary artery disease. However, G6PD-driven pathogenic and G6PD variant-associated protective mechanisms
affecting vascular diseases remain elusive. We therefore propose to determine potential mechanisms, driven by a newly
discovered G6PD isoform in the nucleus of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), that contribute to pathogenic large
artery stiffness and remodeling. Based on strongly supporting preliminary results, we hypothesized that nuclear G6PD
is a modulator of epigenetic modifiers and is a transcription regulator in VSMCs. Consequently, the loss-of-function
G6PD (S188F, N126D) variants block maladaptive modifications of the epigenome, reducing large artery elastance and
remodeling elicited by obesity/metabolic syndrome and balloon-injury. We will test this hypothesis in three specific
aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that G6PD and/or G6PD-coordinated redox in the nucleus controls the
expression and activity of epigenetic modifiers (DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and DNA (TET) and histone
(JARID) demethylases) and transcription of genes that encode proteins involved in regulating the differentiation
(contractile) and dedifferentiation (pro-inflammatory, -thrombotic, and -proliferative) phenotypes in VSMCs. In Aim 2,
we will determine whether loss-of-function G6PD variants detach from epigenetic modifiers to increase DNA
methylation, suppress histone3-lysine4 trimethylation, and reduce transcription of genes that confer maladaptive (pro-
inflammatory, -thrombotic, and -proliferative) properties to VSMCs. In Aim 3, we will determine whether G6PD variant
rats express fewer maladaptive epigenetic (histone3-lysine4 trimethylation) changes and develop less large artery
elastance (stiffness) and vascular remodeling than wild-type rats fed a high-fat diet (a model of obesity/metabolic
syndrome) or subjected to carotid artery balloon-injury. The results from gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies
of this project will reveal the direct effect of G6PD on gene expression associated with pathogenic vascular remodeling
and large artery stiffness, which lead to heart failure and death. We foresee two significant impacts on vascular biology:
[1] linkage of heretofore unknown G6PD-dependent subcellular redox in the nucleus directly to the fundamental
transcriptional mechanics and gene transcription in vascular pathobiology and [2] development of new treatments
targeting redox signaling to reduce large artery stiffness and remodeling."
10784707,"Project Abstract / Summary
Intervention studies of Alzheimer disease (AD) require accurate measurement of cognitive function across
many years. Adequate description of function is hampered by the fact that cognition can significantly fluctuate
from moment-to-moment and from day-to-day. This additional variance adds measurement noise which
impairs sensitivity to detect intervention effects. However, rather than ascribing cognitive variability to
measurement error, there is accumulating evidence to suggest that fluctuations in performance are reflective of
meaningful biological and psychological processes, including variations in daily mood, motivation and attention.
Many of these psychological mechanisms can be captured via standard assessments of personality, which
have been shown to be important behavioral predictors of AD risk. The overall goal of this project is to apply
intensive longitudinal research techniques to the analysis of cognitive function in order to describe and explain
performance variability in healthy aging and in individuals with mild or questionable cognitive impairment. If
daily variability in cognition is predictive of later cognitive decline or other clinically meaningful outcomes, it
may be useful as an additional or alternative cognitive endpoint in clinical trials. This proposal aims to apply
dynamic structural equation models (DSEM) to a three-week intensive longitudinal research design. DSEM
models allow for direct and robust statistical evaluation of variability as a sensitive marker of critical late life
outcomes including cognitive decline and progression to AD. I will collect daily measures of cognitive and
psychological (e.g., personality) function for a three-week period on healthy older adults and those with
questionable impairment. DSEM will test the hypothesis that within-person variability in cognition is related to
clinical status. Reanalysis of an existing dataset will provide further validation of this approach by relating
cognitive variability to disease progression and in vivo AD biomarkers.
I will supplement my extensive experience measuring cognition in healthy aging and early stage AD by gaining
additional, didactic training in advanced analytical techniques including Bayesian modeling and dynamic
structural equation modeling with emphasis on intensive longitudinal research designs. In addition, I will gain
experience providing assessments of clinical function and judging the presence / severity of dementia. The
mentors selected for this application, Drs. Joshua Jackson and John Morris are internationally recognized
experts in the fields of personality assessment and longitudinal modeling in healthy aging, and clinical
assessment of AD respectively and are well suited to serve as mentors on this project.
Through the training and research plan described in this application, I will produce new cognitive endpoints for
AD research. Techniques developed in this proposal can be readily extended to other neurodegenerative or
clinical disorders where cognition plays a key role."
10770515,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed project quantitatively and qualitatively investigates and disseminates the mechanisms underlying
potential racial/ethnic and sex differences in risk for substance use disorder (SUD) and disparities in SUD
treatment services among justice-involved adolescents (JIA). JIA are a critically underserved population who
are especially vulnerable to SUD. Certain ethnic groups and females in the juvenile justice system are
predisposed to harsher consequences of substance misuse and are more prone to suffer from undiagnosed
SUDs. The cascade of care is a novel framework for investigating unmet treatment needs. The stress process
model hypothesizes that disparities occur due to unequal distribution of stressors and resources, offering a
major pathway linking race/ethnicity and sex to disparities at the cascade checkpoints. The study will synergize
transdisciplinary theory and methodology through integrating a) a sociological theory of health disparities—the
stress process model, b) a novel framework for measuring unmet treatment needs–the cascade of care, c)
advanced quantitative methods –mediation analysis in structural equation modeling, and d) innovatory
qualitative approaches–hybrid thematic analysis with cutting-edge technologies. The specific research aims
are to 1) investigate if stress and resources mediate racial/ethnic and sex differences in substance misuse
(SM) patterns; 2) test if stress and resources mediate ethnic and sex disparities in referral to SUD screening,
diagnosis with SUD, treatment initiation and treatment completion; and 3) qualitatively explore how stress and
resources relate to ethnic and sex disparities in SUD services and post-release outcomes. The study employs
mediation analysis in structural equation modeling to analyze a statewide longitudinal database of 100,000 JIA
from the third largest juvenile justice population in the United States. To uncover deeper insights into the
statistical findings, the project conducts and analyzes in-depth interviews and surveys among 60 individuals
who experienced SM and incarceration as minors. Hybrid thematic analysis will be employed to fuse the
quantitative and qualitative data. These aims serve to fulfil NIDA’s mission to advance science on the etiology
of SM, improve SUD prevention and treatment, and advance research on minorities, females, and other
populations facing disproportionate consequences of misuse. To complete the research aims, an extensive
training plan directed by a network of expert mentors who are leaders in the field will be executed. The training
aims are to develop expertise in SUD services delivery in criminal justice systems; mediation analysis in SEM,
psychometrics, censored data, and longitudinal design; interviewing methods in health research and analysis
with the ATLAS.ti software; stress instrumentation; and implementation and translational science. These
training and subsequent research activities are a major step towards developing and testing culturally
appropriate, sex-responsive, and trauma-informed SUD risk assessment protocols and disparity reduction
interventions that innovate SUD screening and treatment delivery in juvenile justice systems."

 Over half the children who underwent in-utero spina bifida repair are unable to walk, and over one-fourth of
them require surgery for tethered spinal cord by school age. Methods to improve long-term spinal cord function
and its co-morbidities for these patients, remains elusive. The long-term goal is to find in-utero spina bifida
treatment approaches that address refinement of methodologies that will promote neurological and
neurodevelopmental gains later in life, thereby functionally adjusting patients’ quality of life for the better. The
objective of this proposal is to use a new approach to repair spina bifida in-utero in a sheep model system, which
may render more beneficial outcomes for lambs over time than current methods of repair. A cryopreserved
human umbilical cord (HUC), an allograft from a healthy term pregnancy following delivery, exerts anti-
inflammatory and anti-scarring properties, synonymously crucial processes that directly impact whether spinal
cord tethering will occur, and hence long-term outcomes. The HUC is currently FDA approved for
ophthalmological diseases. In our preclinical studies, we have shown that use of the cryopreserved human
umbilical cord as a meningeal patch helps regenerate the arachnoid layer, a key barrier to spinal cord infiltrating
scar forming cells, ultimately reducing histological tethering and improving upon spinal cord function. Our central
hypothesis is that the HUC, when used as a meningeal patch with two-layer closure during in-utero spina bifida
repair, will improve long-term clinical outcomes compared to conventional repair or predicated biomaterials. This
was formulated based on our preliminary data, representing a significant advancement in spina bifida treatment
given clinical sequelae improvements, with the potential to vertically advance in-utero treatment. The rationale
for this study is that there is an urgent critical need for an anti-scarring and regenerative matrix that can be placed
as an intermediary layer between the spinal cord and skin layer to reduce tethering. The central hypothesis will
be tested by pursuing three specific aims in a surgical spina bifida sheep model system with a myelotomy: 1) To
compare long-term functional outcome differences between in-utero SB repair methodologies using a HUC vs.
predicate (DurepairTM) biomaterial as a meningeal patch. 2) To quantify and compare long-term spatial and
temporal changes of the spinal cord at defect repair sites for tethering, syringomyelia and inflammation using 3T
MRI and diffusion tensor imaging. 3) To quantitatively compare the underlying mechanisms for long-term
therapeutic efficacies of SB defect repair methodologies. We will pursue these aims using an innovative
combination of surgical and biological manipulative techniques, since use of the cryopreserved human umbilical
cord represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by shifting focus to the anti-inflammatory,
anti-scarring and regenerative repair of the meningeal coverings of spina bifida. The significance lies in the
expected outcome from this work, that the human umbilical cord patch as a meningeal patch should be a viable
longitudinal therapeutic option for spina bifida repair and support a human clinical trial."
10788312,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to determine the efficacy of computerized cognitive training for breast cancer
survivors (BCS) suffering from cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). For millions of cancer survivors,
CRCI is a prevalent, severe, and persistent problem that negatively impacts work outcomes (work ability and
productivity), health perception, and health-related quality of life. Evidence suggests that up to 75% of the more
than 3.8 million BCS in the U.S. will experience cognitive changes that may persist for years after treatment
ends. Unfortunately, the scientific basis for managing these cognitive changes in cancer survivors is extremely
limited. Available evidence from pilot studies, including our own work, suggests that computerized cognitive
training, which is based on the principles of neuroplasticity (ability of brain neurons to re-organize and form
new neural networks), may be a viable treatment option. However, previous trials to date have been limited by
lack of attention-controlled designs, small samples, and limited follow-up. Therefore, to overcome limitations of
past studies and build on our pilot results, the purpose of this 2-group, double-masked, randomized controlled
trial is to conduct the first full-scale efficacy trial to compare computerized cognitive training (BrainHQ) to
computerized active attention control (Sudoku, crossword, word find, etc.) in BCS. Specific aims are to: (1)
test the efficacy of computerized cognitive training on improving perceived cognitive function immediately post-
intervention and over time, compared to active attention control; (2) test the efficacy of computerized cognitive
training on cognitive performance over time compared to attention control; and (3) explore transfer effects on
real-world, everyday outcomes including work-related outcomes and health-related quality of life over time
compared to active attention control. This proposal has been peer-reviewed and endorsed by the NRG
Oncology Research Base of the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCI NCORP) and the
NCI Division of Cancer Prevention has approved NRG Oncology to conduct the trial at their affiliated
sites. A total of 386 eligible BCS will be identified and consented through the NCI NCORP and NCI National
Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) sites, composed of over 2,000 participating locations including community and
minority clinical oncology sites. Outcomes will be collected at four time points: baseline, prior to intervention
(T1), immediately post-intervention (T2), 3 months (T3), and 6 months (T4) post-intervention. Data will be
analyzed using linear mixed models for repeated measures. The current proposal responds directly to the NCI
Notice of Special Interest to test interventions designed to address the adverse aging-related effects of cancer
and cancer treatments, builds on our previous pilot studies while also making methodological improvements,
and leverages access to all NCORP sites. Therefore, this will be the first full-scale study to test computerized
cognitive training in cancer survivors with CRCI and provide empirical evidence for clinicians’
recommendations and survivors’ treatment selections for managing cognitive impairment."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful non-invasive tool for imaging brain activity that allows for
investigating the dynamically changing activity patterns and structure that give rise to human brain function and
dysfunction. Functional MRI (fMRI) signal variations linked with vigilance states, and the subcortical-cortical
networks that underlie these fluctuations in vigilance, are being increasingly recognized as fMRI signals of
interest both for neuroscience and in studying disease. However, vigilance has been largely ignored in routine
fMRI studies, despite the fact that subjects tend to fall asleep in the scanner and certain patient populations may
be susceptible to fatigue or daytime sleepiness. More precisely characterizing the role of vigilance in disease,
and its effects in fMRI data, could be key for developing imaging biomarkers as well as improving treatment. My
doctoral work thus far, (Aim 1.1) developed a method for extracting a vigilance metric, based on fMRI data alone,
using a vigilance-related activity pattern built from correlations between simultaneous fMRI-EEG in healthy young
adults. For my F99 phase, I will (Aim 1.2) investigate whether a state-of-the-art image acquisition/processing
method, multi-echo independent component analysis (ME-ICA), improves the correspondence between fMRI
signal and EEG signal, and whether using the ME-ICA approach improves sensitivity in detecting subcortical
arousal networks. Finally, I will (in Aim 1.3) attempt to distinguish between mild cognitive impaired (MCI) patients
and healthy aging controls by leveraging fMRI-based vigilance as a biomarker. By comparing vigilance
fluctuations and functional connectivity differences in vigilance network regions of interest, we seek to
understand the role of vigilance in early-stage Alzheimer’s disease.
 The proposed project will help the candidate, Sarah Goodale; achieve her career goal of becoming an
independent investigator at the forefront of aging neuroimaging at a research-focused institution. This project
provides cutting-edge research training in EEG and fMRI analysis and advanced statistical methods. Further,
the proposed studies will provide professional and technical training to prepare the candidate to successfully
transition the postdoctoral (K00) phase. The postdoctoral laboratory will extend Sarah’s training to incorporate
structural imaging to characterize the impact of structural degeneration on functional networks with respect to
age-related cognitive decline. Vanderbilt University is an ideal environment to achieve these goals as it (1)

The Genome Technology portfolio at NHGRI encompasses a substantial diversity of scientific approaches and
objectives, from instrumentation development to high-throughput application of technologies to characterizing
the genomic basis for phenotypic traits. These research efforts have produced significant insight into biology and
disease, and yet there are many opportunities to accelerate innovation, development, and early dissemination
of genomic technologies. The goal of the Genome Technology Coordinating Center (GTCC) is to maximize these
opportunities by liaising grantees and NHGRI Program Staff, managing research funds, and developing
educational resources to support and tout the excellence of the Genome Technology program. We propose the
following aims to meet these goals: 1) Facilitate collaborations across the Genome Technology Program and
promote standards that aid in achieving Program goals. We will host and support Annual meetings for the
Genome Technology and CEGS programs. We will also develop Working Groups among grantees to promote
collaboration-building and the development of metrics and standards for genomic technologies. We will use these
Working Groups to identify gaps in the field that will provide the foundation for solicitation of Opportunity Funds.
2) Establish and manage an Opportunity Funds program to support initial development of promising new
technologies and ideas. These Opportunity Funds will be distributed as pilot projects (early stage or proof-of-
principle studies) and development projects (comparatively advanced studies with supportive preliminary data)
in years 2-4. Peer review will be conducted by an External Review Panel of experts in genomic technology. 3)
Implement community outreach activities to encourage awareness of Genome Technology Program successes
and facilitate access by the scientific community. We will develop and manage an Education and Outreach
Working Group composed of grantees and educational experts to identify and prioritize areas of development
for educational materials, and host and advertise a website to distribute those materials. A targeted effort will be
made to expose underrepresented and underserved populations in science to the advances and importance of
the Genome Technology Program. Informational resources related to technology transfer and intellectual
property will be developed for grantees. The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) is uniquely qualified to serve as the
GTCC for the Genome Technology Program. The Laboratory has over ninety years of history in supporting
mammalian genetics research including through the provision of widely used information resources (e.g. Mouse
Genome Informatics) and educational programs including the Annual Short Course on Experimental Models of
Human Cancer (29 years), and the McKusick Short Course on Human and Mammalian Genetics and Genomics
(nearly 60 years). The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine was established in 2012 to apply the Lab’s
expertise in genomics and technology development toward improvements in genome-based medicine."

The overall goal of the renewal of the 2017-2022 Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in
Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-
NO) is to enhance the diversity of the BMS research workforce by continuing equitable and expanded access to
research skills and training, thereby yielding increased competitiveness, acceptance, and completion of Ph.D.
BMS programs by individuals who are underrepresented in science, such as persons from backgrounds that
have been historically-excluded, and/or socioeconomically disadvantaged, and/or persons with disabilities. In
the U.S. during 2018-2019, 19% of STEM Bachelor’s degrees were conferred to students from groups un-
derrepresented in the sciences; while 10% earned Master’s degrees, and only 7% earned a PhD degree. In
Louisiana during 2019-2020, 31% of Biological and Biomedical Sciences Bachelor’s degrees were earned by
students from groups underrepresented in science, while 18% earned Master’s degrees, and only 6% earned a
PhD degree. Sixty-two percent of our former PREP Scholars are currently enrolled in PhD programs. LSUHSC-
NO PREP will accept 30 recent eligible baccalaureate science graduates over 5 years for intensive research and
innovative academic training experiences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. The PREP will
enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS Ph.D. programs by providing: 1)
intensive research experiences with committed and funded faculty mentors; and 2) essential skills development
training during the 1-yr training. Solid foundations in research skills will be provided by the following: 1) concen-
trated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results using statistics, and writing; 2) inventive and
personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; 3) experience in oral
and poster scientific presentations; 4) training in responsible and ethical conduct in research, rigor, and repro-
ducibility; and 5) writing a personal statement, selecting, applying, and interviewing for graduate schools. Schol-
ars will participate in weekly skills and career development workshops hosted by PREP faculty, internal and
external scientists; join graduate students in skills development programs, courses, and seminars; present their
research at the annual PREP symposium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research
fellows; assist in community science education programs; and participate in community outreach. Thirty-six LSU-
HSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school,
undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing students underrepresented in the
BMS through NIH R01, P20, T32, R25, R35, and other funding mechanisms. Scholar recruitment efforts will
extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities, to develop a community-wide mechanism to
support the BMS workforce. The program will be evaluated using formative and summative methodologies &
quantitative and qualitative statistics to document success."

Natural killer (NK) cells comprise an important arm of the host innate immune system that detects and
eliminates virus-infected cells. Newborns and immune-compromised patients lacking NK cells are
extremely susceptible to viral infection. In particular, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can cause severe
health complications or be life-threatening in these individuals. Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) is an
accurate and robust model for investigating NK cell responses against HCMV. Using MCMV infection in
mice, we have discovered that NK cells possess novel adaptive immune features such as clonal
expansion and long-lived memory. In the past decade, our laboratory has uncovered many of the cellular
and molecular mechanisms underlying NK cell memory. Our long-term goals are to understand the
general biology of NK cells, and the molecular basis by which these powerful innate lymphocytes can
mediate protection against pathogen invasion. To this end, we have recently identified several
transcriptional and metabolic pathways that may influence the NK cell response against MCMV infection.
Based on this exciting preliminary data, our current R01 grant proposes to use cutting edge metabolomics
and newly engineered transgenic mouse models to study how metabolism in antiviral NK cells in
transcriptionally regulated. In Aim 1, we seek to understand how proinflammatory cytokines and the STAT
family of transcription factors control of NK cell metabolism during MCMV infection. In Aim 2, we will
determine the requirement for aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation in antiviral NK cells using
conditional ablation of genes encoding LDHA and CPT1a, respectively. In Aim 3, we will determine
whether the transcription factor Bhlhe40 regulates mitochondrial metabolism and fitness in effector NK
cells fighting MCMV infection. Altogether, the studies in this R01 proposal will greatly increase our
understanding of the underlying transcriptional and metabolic mechanisms whereby NK cells contribute
to host defense during viral infection, and establish novel translational paradigms for harnessing the NK
cell compartment for immunization and therapeutic strategies against infectious diseases."
10824236,"Abstract
Developing next-generation vaccines for rapidly evolving pathogens (e.g., influenza, HIV) requires implementing
rational approaches to engineer immunogens that can direct immune responses to conserved epitopes; in doing
so, broad, durable responses are likely to occur. A “universal” or broadly protective influenza vaccine should
induce broad immunity within circulating influenzas (e.g., H1, H3) and provide heterosubtypic and pre-pandemic
protection. A goal of Project 3 is to design immunogens that elicit such protective humoral responses by targeting
key conserved viral sites on the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). We build upon our initial
immunogen design strategies primarily focused on directing B-cell responses to the HA receptor binding site
(RBS) to address how T-cell help influences the elicited immune responses. Furthermore, we integrate our
immunogen design strategies established for HA and extend them to NA in order to understand if the design
principles for directing immune responses to HA are generalizable. Specifically, we use our structure-guided
“resurfacing” approach to graft the NA catalytic site from circulating N1 and N2 NAs onto exotic, avian non-
circulating NAs. These “acceptor” NAs will serve as molecular scaffolds to present the conserved N1 and N2
catalytic site but with a heterologous periphery; elicited responses will maintain conserved contacts but adapt to
the heterologous periphery and thus broadening the response. We use these resurfaced NAs to additionally
develop NA heterochimeric tetramers (NAtChs) that present four copies of the grafted catalytic site but on four
antigenically distinct scaffolds in efforts to increase immune focusing to this epitope. Finally, we will develop a
novel viral-antibody coevolution assay using directed evolution platforms to understand how influenza may
evolve to escape a focused immune response elicited by our engineered immunogens. This innovative approach
may help anticipate viral escape and allow identification of vaccine regimen(s) that force influenza into an
“evolutionary trap” by compromising overall viral fitness. Collectively, the data generated within this Project will
contribute to developing next-generation influenza vaccines incorporating both HA and NA as potential
immunogens."
10824238,"Abstract Project 4
The goals of this component of a continuing Program Project are to advance understanding of the
human humoral immune response to influenza virus infection and vaccination and to apply that
understanding to immunogen design for next generation vaccines. To contribute to those goals, this Project
has the following four Aims. (1) Analyze the distribution of neuraminidase (NA) epitopes recognized by
memory B cells in recently vaccinated individuals, as a foundation both for analysis of the epitope-
dependent response to NA and for design of immunogens in Project 3. (2) Carry out a broad analysis of the
way in which the response to influenza vaccination depends on the age of the subjects and hence the
extent of antigenic experience with influenza and the subtype responsible for immune imprinting. We will
sample the accessible components of the human B-cell repertoire from several representatives of distinct
age groups and map their epitopes by binding and, for representatives of all epitopic regions across the
hemagglutinin molecule, by cryo-EM structure determination. This component will include influenza NA, but
focus largely on hemagglutinin (HA). (3) Collaborate with Project 3 in three areas: studies of the influence of
T-cell epitope diversity on humoral responses to designed HA immunogens, design of NA immunogens, and
modeling the virus-antibody co-evolutionary ""arms race"" with directed evolution in the laboratory. (4)
Determine structures of selected antibody:antigen complexes, to support efforts in Projects 1 and 2."

 The Development and Evaluation of Computerized Chemosensory-Based Orbitofrontal Networks
Training for Treatment of Pain (CBOT-P) is a project to develop an effective, scalable, user-friendly, and home-
based neuromodulatory platform for broad-spectrum treatment of chronic pain conditions with associated
negative affect and cognitive impairments. Chronic pain (CP) affects 1.5 billion people globally, and causes
severe human suffering, disability, and high financial burden. Clinical and neuroscience studies show that CP
over time leads to shrinkage in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions and their deep brain connections critical to
emotion, motivation, and cognitive functions. As a result, more than 40% of CP patients suffer negative affect
(i.e., anxiety and depression), cognitive and decision-making problems and reduced drive. Chronic pain with
negative affect (CP-N) is more debilitating, harder to treat, costlier to payers and significantly more associated
with opioid use, overdose, and deaths. In a stakeholder value canvassing exercise CP sufferers and pain
doctors unanimously desire new non-invasive, home-based, safe, and effective interventions that can reduce
pain severity by more than 10%, suggesting that current treatments have limitations. Anterograde and
retrograde anatomical tracings have been used to demonstrate direct (monosynaptic) anatomical connection
between the OFC and the descending inhibitory pain nodes at the midbrain periaqueductal gray matter (PAG).
Transition to CP is marked by weakened modulation of the PAG-descending inhibition. Evon Medics, a small
business specializing in olfactory neurotherapeutics, developed an innovative chemosensory-based
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) stimulation device, called CBOT-P, for home use, to increase OFC plasticity and
effect OFC-induced regulation of pain and negative affect. We now plan to refine this product for broad pain
conditions and quickly make it available to the population. OFC is the part of the prefrontal cortex that plays
key roles in multisensory integration, affect regulation, and decision-making. The lateral OFC, which is
consistently activated by pain, is connected to other cortical brain regions that process pain; and the medial
OFC, which networks with medial temporal affect networks, is engaged by mindfulness therapy for pain and
plays important role in positive affect and drive. Unfortunately, CP and opioid analgesics are associated with
OFC shrinkage, which amplifies pain through increased negative affect (NA) and cognitive impairment. The
success of CBOT-P in acute relief of NA and pain in our pilot studies is not surprising because single-pulsed
electrical stimulations with OFC-placed electrodes acutely relieved NA in humans in invasive deep brain
stimulation, and experimentally induced stimulation of the OFC in animal models and humans activates the
PAG to reduce pain sensitization. The CBOT-P uses Evon’s proprietary regimen of 10 odorant phytochemicals
to stimulate the secondary olfactory cortex (i.e. the OFC) repetitively, with established micro-controller-
regulated stimulation parameter settings that maintain persistent activation of the OFC and medial temporal
regions, without habituation; paired with digitally-administered olfactory psychophysical training tasks that
activate same regions, for synergistic effect on long-term neuroplasticity changes that prevents CP-induced
shrinkage. As a second mechanism of action, the olfactory stimulants were fortified with proprietary
components, such as beta-caryophyllene (BCP), a selective endocannabinoid-2 receptor agonist, which has
strong anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects, and scalable for acute positive affect.
 In the Phase I of this Fast-Track SBIR application, we will (a) configure CBOT-P regimen and
stimulation parameters for faster onset of mood elevating and analgesic effects, focusing on Chronic Low Back
Pain populations and (b) establish its neural mechanism of action through target-engagement studies of OFC
activity and functional connectivity with other pain regulating regions at baseline. In Phase II, we will perform a
powered randomized trial of the refined CBOT-P from Phase I, compared to sham CBOT in CLBP, to
determine its short- and long-term effectiveness on Pain, Affect, Cognition and cortical brain Structure (PACS),
long-term safety, and indications. We will also collect user experiences to help refine a final marketable CBOT
product, enter the FDA breakthrough designation program for pain that would lead to Medicare/Medicaid
reimbursement, engage a wider network of pain stakeholders, and establish marketing for commercial
success. Project success will be enhanced through strong collaborations between Evon Medics, Johns
Hopkins (JHU) Pain Center, Howard University investigators, community pain providers and collaborating
manufacturers. To the best of our knowledge this will be the first home-based combinatorial digital-
chemosensory neuromodulatory product for stimulation of deep brain regions for CP management."

environment needed to accomplish PLUTO's goals. The Antibody Core will develop large panels of
recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against coronavirus spike proteins to define specificity and
breath of immune responses elicited by coronavirus infections and/or vaccinations in humans and animal
models. The Animal Model Core will provide a central resource with approvals, facilities, and expertise
to assess efficacy of broadly cross-reactive coronavirus antibodies and vaccines in robust pre-clinical
models against a spectrum of coronaviruses, including Select Agents. A multidisciplinary team of scientists
from five institutions who have an outstanding track record of working collaboratively will conduct the
proposed studies. The Research Projects will collaborate with each other and with the Antibody and
Animal Model Cores, coordinated by the Administrative Core. The integrated and synergistic activities
across Projects and Cores will drive the successful completion of the program project's ambitious

The Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC) has one of the largest rhesus monkey breeding colonies
in the US. This resource has provided animals for NIH funded HIV/AIDS research projects for several decades
and is a critical component of the Center’s successful research program. Because over half of all research
projects at TNPRC are initiated by Affiliate (outside) investigators, this resource is essential to the
success of many NIH-funded investigators throughout the US. The TNPRC has a long history of deriving,
developing, and managing large macaque breeding colonies. The experience derived from many years of colony
management is a significant contributing factor to the successful establishment of the U42 SPF colony and
achieving the goal of converting the entire TNPRC rhesus monkey colony to SPF status. The TNPRC has
focused on a philosophy of continuous improvement, which is fostered by the use of evidence, derived from
observation, controlled scientific study, and the literature to drive decision making. This philosophy is employed
in many areas of the program including housing, behavioral management, husbandry practices, nursery rearing,
preventive medicine, and clinical veterinary care. The objective of this application is to request funds for
continued support and maintenance of this SPF rhesus monkey breeding colony at the TNPRC. The
maintenance of the U42 breeding colony requires the integration of many aspects of the animal care program at
TNPRC including veterinary care, behavioral management, genetic monitoring, and viral testing to ensure SPF
status of the colony. This section describes the husbandry and management of the colony and focuses on daily
care operations, behavioral management, and clinical care.
The Specific Aim of this core is to provide husbandry and veterinary care for the SPF breeding colony established
in the existing U42 grant. This includes robust programs for clinical care and behavioral management. The colony
has reached a mature status of approximately 977 animals with ideal demographics to produce up to 150 animals
available for assignment each year. Program Income generated by the sale of animals will be returned to an
account for use in supporting the aims of the grant."
10764703,"Project Summary/Abstract - Viral Testing Core
Continuous, accurate surveillance for agents of concern is an essential requirement for maintenance of a SPF
breeding colony. In 2009 we transitioned from testing at off-site laboratories to performing all screening assays
at the Tulane National Primate Research Center’s (TNPRC) Pathogen Detection and Quantification Core
(PDQC). The PDQC is administratively located in the Division of Microbiology and was established at the TNPRC
in 2004. The primary mission of the PDQC is to provide diagnostic services to the Division of Veterinary Medicine
for establishing and maintaining SPF nonhuman primate colonies. A secondary mission is to provide research
support to investigators. The development of onsite viral testing capabilities has resulted in reduced costs,
eliminated shipping of samples, reduced turnaround time, and provided a platform for easy expansion for
detection of additional agents. Quality assurance of the TNPRC SPF surveillance program is supported by the
participation of the PDQC in proficiency panels testing from the Pathogen Detection Working Group (PDWG) of
the NIH Nonhuman Primate Research Consortium (NHPRC) and the External Quality Assurance Program
Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL) Luminex program. This section of the application focuses on the function of the
Viral Testing Core, techniques used for identification and detection of the target viruses, assay performance and
validation, and current and future expansion of testing capabilities.
The Aim of this core is to assure the SPF status of the colony through continued viral testing of existing breeding
colony animals and all offspring. The SPF4 colony will be tested a minimum of twice each year for all four target
viruses: Type D simian retrovirus (SRV), simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV), simian immunodeficiency virus
(SIV), and herpes B virus (BV) for SPF4. Characterization of the colony beyond the targeted agents supported
by the U42 grant will continue through the development and use of additional assays for other pathogens of

The SPF rhesus macaque breeding colony for AIDS research at the Tulane National Primate Research Center
(TNPRC) is part of an extensive evidence-based, integrative, program that incorporates best practices in health
surveillance, husbandry, preventive medicine, and behavioral and genetic management. The goals of the genetic
management program are to 1) maintain genetic diversity and minimize inbreeding to support sustainable
populations and 2) characterize class I MHC alleles in support of HIV/AIDS research activities. To this end, the
TNPRC Genome Bank collects and stores materials from more than 9000 unique animals, with additional
animals collected as they are produced. The colony is characterized for ancestral geographic-origin and
parentage confirmed using a pan-NPRC SNP panel. MHC typing for all animals includes testing for 10 class I
alleles, which serves the needs of most core and affiliate scientists, and MHC deep sequencing in collaboration
with the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center for targeted research programs. Over the previous grant
funding period whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been added for 164 key breeders, focusing on those males
with the greatest reproductive output in the breeding colony, and whole exome sequencing (WES) from 72
additional animals. Funding for WGS on an additional 200 animals during the coming budget period is also
anticipated. These efforts are supported by core TNPRC scientists in collaboration with researchers from other
NPRCs and research institutions. These efforts are made in concert with the broader NPRC community through
consortia activities, notably, the Nonhuman Primate Genetics and Genomics Working Group. Presently, the
efforts of the genetic management program and MHC Genetic Typing Core are to continue to provide high-
quality MHC characterization of the SPF breeding colony in support of HIV/AIDS research, to integrate MHC
typing with other genetic and genomic data currently being characterized at the TNPRC, and to develop
additional support structures for sharing this data with the research community. These efforts ensure the SPF
rhesus macaque breeding colony is healthy, sustainable, and of maximal translational research value to the
broader HIV/AIDS research community."

early-stage) investigators into the Center that serves to invigorate its research efforts; and (4) providing a
stimulating environment that enriches training opportunities and professional development in alcohol research."
10771155,"SUMMARY
A cardinal feature of alcohol use disorder (AUD) is loss of control over drinking. The neural substrates that
underlie transition from controlled social drinking to uncontrolled alcohol abuse are not fully understood but likely
involve disruption of brain areas involved in assessing risk versus reward and in inhibiting maladaptive behaviors.
During the current funding cycle, we focused on defining the actions of alcohol on neurons within the orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC), a part of the prefrontal cortex that is critical for choice and decision making. Studies also examined
how manipulating the activity OFC neurons affects drinking. Results show that acute alcohol inhibits OFC neuron
activity via a glycine receptor and dopamine D1 receptor-dependent mechanism, while monoamine inhibition of
OFC spiking requires D2, a2 and 5HT-1a receptors that are coupled to inhibitory GIRK channels. Following
repeated cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure or voluntary drinking, OFC neurons were hyper-
excitable and no longer sensitive to alcohol or monoamines. Blocking OFC output via excitotoxic lesions or
inhibitory DREADDs had little effect on alcohol drinking in non-dependent animals but further enhanced elevated
consumption in CIE-treated mice. In this renewal application, we propose three aims that complement and
extend findings from the current project. These studies focus on defining how neurons in the OFC and basolateral
amygdala (BLA) converge on and influence activity and functional output of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in
the dorsal striatum (DS). Studies will use our well-characterized mouse model of CIE exposure combined with
operant alcohol self-administration and in vitro and in vivo measures of neural activity. Aim 1 studies use ex vivo
slice electrophysiology and retrograde labeling to examine the excitability and acute alcohol sensitivity of OFC
and BLA neurons that project to the DS in non-dependent and alcohol-dependent male and female C57BL/6J
mice. Dual color optogenetic constructs and transgenic reporter mice will be used to evoke OFC and BLA
synaptic currents onto DS D1 and D2 MSNs in slices from Air and CIE treated mice. Aim 2 studies use in vivo
calcium fiber photometry to measure CIE-induced changes in the activity and alcohol sensitivity of DS projecting
OFC and BLA neurons during operant self-administration of alcohol and alcohol with tastants that reduce
(quinine) or enhance (sucrose) drinking in non-dependent mice. Complementary fiber photometry studies will
monitor the activity of DS MSNs innervated by OFC and BLA inputs. Studies in Aim 3 will use in vivo optogenetics
(e.g. Chronus, Chrimson, ArchT) to bi-directionally manipulate DS projecting OFC and BLA inputs to assess how
these pathways regulate drinking and how this is altered by alcohol dependence. Overall, the results of these
studies will advance our understanding of mechanisms that contribute to the escalation of drinking in alcohol-
dependent subjects and provide key data needed to develop better treatments for individuals with AUD."
10771161,"SUMMARY
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) represents a significant public health concern and confers a large cost to society
due to violence, lost productivity, and healthcare expenditures. Despite decades of intense research efforts,
there are just a few FDA-approved medications for AUD, each of which are only modestly efficacious. GET73 is
a promising new medication that has shown promise in its initial development phase for improving AUD
symptoms, as evidenced by anti-alcohol-drinking and anxiolytic properties in preclinical/animal studies.
Preclinical research also indicates that GET73’s mechanism of action relates to its negative allosteric modulation
of the metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptor (mGluR5), a novel potential therapeutic target of growing
interest. Phase 1 clinical studies show GET73 to be safe and well-tolerated in both individuals with AUD and
healthy volunteers. Thus, considerable preliminary evidence supports GET73 as a new, safe, well-tolerated, and
potentially therapeutic treatment for AUD. Extending this preclinical and clinical research, the proposed research
project represents the first investigation of the effects of GET73 on alcohol drinking, both in a tightly controlled
laboratory setting and in the natural environment, in individuals with AUD. Neuroimaging indicators of purported
GET73 mechanisms of action, including fronto-cortical glutamate and GABA levels via proton magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and brain reactivity to alcohol cues via functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI), will be investigated as potential mediators of the effect of GET73 on drinking. Non-treatment-
seeking participants with AUD (N=90) will be randomized to GET73 (300 mg, 3x/day) or placebo for the proposed
8-day study. Prior to randomization (Day-1), a pre-treatment MRI will be completed, during which anatomical,
1H-MRS, and alcohol-cue reactivity fMRI scans will be acquired. On Day-7, participants’ drinking over the
previous five days will be assessed, and all MRI procedures will be repeated. On Day-8, participants will consume
a standard priming drink and undergo a limited-access alcohol self-administration (bar-lab) paradigm, in a similar
fashion to previous Charleston ARC clinical studies. It is hypothesized that GET73-treated participants, relative
to placebo-treated participants, will drink less in the 5-day free-access period as well as during bar-lab limited-
access procedure. GET73-treated participants are also hypothesized to have increased fronto-cortical levels of
glutamate and GABA, reflecting normalization of the pathologically low glutamate and GABA levels typically
found in individuals with AUD who are not experiencing acute alcohol withdrawal, paired with decreased
reactivity to alcohol cues in key cognitive-control and cue-reactivity-related brain regions (e.g., medial prefrontal
cortex and ventral striatum, respectively). These effects are anticipated to mediate the relationship between
GET73 and alcohol drinking. Overall, this project has the potential to significantly advance the development of a
novel pharmacological treatment for AUD."

 Our lab develops and applies integrated experimental and computational methods to elucidate the impact
of mechanics on biology at multiple scales. Our goal for the next few years is to uncover how the interplay of
complex biophysical factors in the tissue microenvironment drives structural and functional state transitions at
the cytoskeletal, cellular, and tissue levels. In particular, we will focus on the interplay between osmotic pressure,
extracellular matrix (ECM) crosslinking, and mesoscale ECM architectures. These factors are prominent in
tissues and often simultaneously present, but their fundamental integrated impact on cellular systems is not well
understood. We will investigate how together they act as inputs that program local molecular and cellular
interactions. We will extract the critical input parameter values that induce drastic mode switching, especially in
cytoskeletal organization and function, cell migration, cell-matrix interactions, and collective cell dissemination.
We will determine the mechanisms and consequences of biophysical transitions at different scales and how they
function as on and off switches for global tissue phenotypes."

Physician-scientists are crucial for translating new discoveries in basic science into improvements in patient
care. As advances in biomedical research continue to expand our understanding of human biology, it is critical
to maintain a strong cadre of physician scientists who will be able to apply this new knowledge to improve
health outcomes. Concern has been growing for years that physician-scientists are decreasing in numbers,
and current trends indicate that this decrease is likely to get worse. Thus, new approaches are needed to
recruit more physicians into research careers and provide them with the skills and mentorship necessary for
success. The Vanderbilt Training of Otolaryngology Physician-Scientists (V-TOPS) program addresses this
challenge by providing mentored research experiences for otolaryngology residents and medical students. We
hypothesize that two characteristics of our research education program will make it more likely that trainees will
continue to pursue research careers: (a) research experiences aligned with a trainee’s clinical interests and (b)
mentor-mentee relationships with successful physician-scientists. After matriculation, trainees are paired with a
physician-scientist mentor who continues as an important adviser throughout their training. Residents in the
program will spend two years doing research, between the second and third year of clinical otolaryngology
training, thus providing adequate time for them to decide on a clinical focus area and pursue relevant research
projects. We have assembled an experienced and diverse cohort of 15 faculty mentors representing a variety
of research areas, including laryngeal physiology, rhinology/olfaction, airway immunology and inflammation,
head and neck oncology, cochlear implants, and language disorders. We will accept one resident per year into
the research program out of a total cohort of 5 residents. In addition, the V-TOPS program will accept two
medical students each year for a one-year research experience, supplemented with a didactic program and
individual mentoring by successful physician-scientists. Our expansive research portfolio, experienced faculty
of basic and translational scientists, and the rich history for research education at Vanderbilt, make this an
ideal environment to develop the next generation of physician scientists in otolaryngology."

This application proposes a five-year research and training plan with a scientific focus on the mechanisms
through which PD-1 checkpoint inhibition leads to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The hypothesis is
that de novo loss of PD-1 signaling enhances the antigen sensitivity of CD4 T cells and leads to the activation of
autoreactive CD4 T cells that mediate irAE development. To investigate this hypothesis, the candidate will
analyze two complementary human cohorts of his mentors: a) a prospective irAE cohort of patients on PD-1
immunotherapy to compare the early changes of CD4 T cells in patients who do (irAE+) and do not (irAE-) develop
irAEs, and b) a cohort of patients on PD-1 immunotherapy that receive seasonal influenza vaccination to test
whether any underlying immunopathology in irAE+ patients, not otherwise observed with evaluation of basal
states, can be revealed with the help of immunization. Using the prospective irAE cohort, Aim 1 will evaluate
whether patients that develop irAEs have a different naïve CD4 T cell epigenetic and transcriptional profile at
baseline that allows robust activation of autoreactive CD4 T cells following PD-1 inhibition. Further, this aim will
analyze the transcriptional profile and clonal diversity of the activated CD4 T cells generated after PD-1 inhibition
in irAE+ patients. Using the aPD-1 cohort of influenza vaccination, Aim 2 will answer the question of whether
PD-1 signaling is required to finetune the TCR threshold and transcriptional profile of CD4 T cell responses to
maintain immune fitness and homeostasis. These studies will define the path through which PD-1 inhibition leads
to the activation and propagation of autoreactive CD4 T cells to cause immune-mediated pathology. They will
also identify cellular and molecular targets that can be used for early diagnosis and treatment of patients with
rheumatologic and other irAEs. Scientifically, the candidate’s career development goals are to gain expertise
in the conduct of clinical and translational research, bioinformatic analyses, single-cell technologies, and
transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of autoimmune pathways in patient samples. Professionally, the
candidate aims to gain experience in scientific writing, grant preparation, communication, and data presentation
culminating to an R01 submission. To facilitate the candidate’s growth as a physician-scientist, this proposal
combines novel experimental single-cell approaches and a specific career development plan designed by the
candidate and his mentors, Dr. Wherry and Dr. Laufer. The candidate’s long-term goal is to transition to a tenure-
track faculty position and to develop an independent NIH-funded research program focusing on the mechanisms
of autoimmunity and T cell dysfunction to ultimately prevent and treat rheumatologic diseases. The rich scientific
and collaborative environment at the University of Pennsylvania will position the candidate to have a highly
impactful, translational research career in human autoimmunity."
10800774,"Project Summary/Abstract
Regulatory T cell (Treg) immunosuppression is critical for maintaining immune tolerance to a diverse array of
potential antigens in the intestinal mucosa. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic intestinal
inflammation overwhelms local Treg function, allowing inflammation to persist. Our previous work and that of
others have identified important roles for 17β-estradiol (estrogen, E2) signaling in promoting Treg differentiation
and function. E2 signals through two nuclear receptors, alpha and beta (ERα, ERβ), to modulate gene
transcription in target cells. Although they share high sequence homology, ERα and ERβ mediate distinct and
often opposing functions on gene regulation. In previously published work, we showed that shifting the balance
of E2 signaling towards ERα is generally pro-inflammatory, whereas shifting towards ERβ is generally protective.
In recent preliminary studies using IBD patient samples, we observed significantly diminished ERβ expression
in intestinal biopsy tissues and peripheral T cells from females with active Crohn’s disease (CD). We also found
that ERβ-deficient T cells are resistant to ex vivo, TGFβ-dependent Treg differentiation, and that deletion of ERβ
in a spontaneous ileitis model (SAMP/YitFC, “SAMP” mice) results in significant impairment of Treg
transcriptional and functional responses, contributing to exacerbated inflammation. Therefore, the goal of this
project is to determine the molecular and cellular mechanism(s) by which altered E2 signaling impacts
Treg differentiation and function, contributing to intestinal inflammation. The mechanisms by which E2
signaling cross-talks with inflammatory signals to influence immune cell function are poorly understood. This
proposal seeks to address this knowledge gap through our central hypothesis that dysregulated E2 signaling
contributes to Treg transcriptional remodeling and loss-of-function, facilitating sustained intestinal
inflammation in IBD. In Aim 1, we propose to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which ERα- and ERβ
cross-talk with signaling downstream of TGFβ in primary T cells, influencing TGFβ-dependent Foxp3 expression
and function. Aim 2 will determine the functional impact of rebalancing Treg-specific E2 signaling on intestinal
inflammation in vivo, testing our hypothesis that augmenting Treg-specific ERβ signaling may prevent and/or
rescue intestinal inflammation. Experiments will include adoptive transfer of ERβ-expressing Tregs to SAMP
mice, as well as in vivo assays using a T cell-dependent colitis model. In Aim 3, we plan to determine the
transcriptional and functional effects of rebalancing E2 signaling in CD patient Tregs using novel MaxCyte
transfection technology, assessing ERα- and ERβ-specific effects on (i) TGFβ-dependent Foxp3 induction in
naïve T cells and (ii) ex vivo suppressive function of Tregs. Successful completion of our proposed Aims
will provide key mechanistic insight into the functional impact of E2 signaling in Tregs, an under-studied
area with broad applicability to numerous diseases exhibiting dysregulation of ER expression and/or
activation and subsequent reductions in Treg function."

 Secondary lymphedema is a morbid condition affecting over 5 million patients in the United States.
Patients with this condition develop lymphatic retention, which progresses to irreversible subcutaneous
fibroadipose deposition in the affected extremity. As a result, patients experience chronic pain, decreased
mobility and function, open wounds, and overall reduced quality-of-life. In Aim 1, I will examine how a
stimulation of a signaling mediator which augments adipocyte differentiation may reduce overall fibroadipose
deposition by preventing the proliferation of pathologic stem cell populations. In Aim 2, I will examine how
inhibition of a pro-survival signaling mediator may impact adipocyte and pre-adipocyte survival. In the process,
I seek to understand whether specific subsets of these cells are more likely to undergo apoptosis. Finally, in
Aim 3, I seek to develop a local cell therapy which obviates the systemic adverse effects of therapies which
modify cell differentiation or survival. In the process, I will have developed a therapy which is capable of
secreting microRNA, paving the way for a new class of cell therapeutics.
 The career development award is indispensable for my maturation as a physician-scientist, to serve as a
scientific and clinical leader performing research which is inspired by the challenges my patients face, rigorous
in its evaluation of the underlying pathogenesis of this condition, and translational in its consideration of
treatment strategies. I am supported by a team of mentors with expertise in stem cell and adipocyte biology,
clinical lymphedema management, and in academic plastic surgery leadership. I am also supported by a team
of additional scientific advisors with expertise in lymphedema biology, cell therapy, and translational medicine.
The institution is committed to my success, with protected time for activities proposed in this award, laboratory
space, salary support, and laboratory funding. During the 5-year career development award, I will build on my
previous expertise with monitoring stem cell fate using lineage-tracing mouse models, and add new scientific
expertise to my armamentarium with single-cell RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. I will engage in
workshops and seminars to build on my technical skillset, and develop essential laboratory leadership skills.
Upon completion of my 4th year of the career development award, I will submit for my first R01 submission,
with the goal of further advancing findings obtained during my career development award. Upon completion of
the 5-year award period, I will expect to have established my scientific expertise in adipocyte biology, cell
therapy, and lymphedema, and established my technical expertise in lineage-tracing and RNA sequencing, to
contribute broadly to the scientific environment in my institution."

Tissue factor (TF), the primary initiator of the blood coagulation cascade, is carefully regulated to prevent
aberrant coagulation activation. However, pathological conditions including bacterial and viral infection induce
intravascular TF expression and lead to thrombosis. As TF-induced thrombosis is a major cause of acute
myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and pulmonary embolism, improved understanding of the mechanisms of
pathological TF activation may lead to new therapeutic targets. Pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death,
drives TF-mediated intravascular coagulation activation in bacterial sepsis. Emerging studies also implicate
inflammasome activation in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but its role in TF activation is unknown. Our preliminary
studies demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and specifically its accessory protein ORF3A induce TF activation in a
phosphatidylserine (PS)-dependent mechanism that requires TMEM16F, similar to PS-dependent TF activation
in pyroptosis. In Aim 1, we will investigate whether ORF3a-induced TF activation is driven by inflammasome-
mediated pyroptosis. Lipid peroxidation and its highly reactive end products such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE)
are involved in various forms of programmed cell death including pyroptosis. However, the role of HNE, the most
stable and toxic reactive aldehyde produced during lipid peroxidation, in pyroptosis-associated TF and
coagulation activation is not known. Our preliminary data showed that HNE induces PS-dependent TF activation
in LPS-primed macrophages and causes intravascular coagulation activation in mice. However, the complete
mechanism by which HNE induces PS externalization and TF activation is not known. In Aim 2, we will use
chemical genetic approaches to dissect the mechanism of HNE-induced TF activation via pyroptosis in vitro and
in vivo. Although lipid peroxidation plays a central role in cell death and coagulation activation in bacterial sepsis,
a therapeutically targetable enzyme responsible for the unbridled lipid peroxidation and generation of
pathological levels of reactive radicals such as HNE is not known. In Aim 3, we will use genetically modified mice
deficient in lipid peroxidation and HNE formation to investigate TF-dependent pathologic coagulation activation
and thrombosis during sepsis. A successful completion of these studies will help delineate a common pathway
involved in pathologic TF activation across varied pathogenic infections and will also help identify a specific
therapeutically targetable enzyme to attenuate TF activation in disease."

South Africa has the largest HIV epidemic worldwide with 7.8 million people currently living with
HIV. The scaling up of HIV treatment and prevention over the past decade has led to a reduction
of nearly half of new HIV infections and AIDS related deaths between 2010 and 2020.
Notwithstanding this success, our team has presented evidence showing that reduction in new
infections is not homogeneous over time and space and across the age-sex strata. This uneven
risk reduction has led to a shift in the HIV risk landscape resulting in the emergence of new
vulnerable groups. Two major events are likely to cause further changes to the risk landscape.
The first is the shift to Dolutegravir-based antiretroviral treatment regimens. The second is the
disruptions of health services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic creating unprecedented
challenges in HIV care delivery.
Our long-term goal for this proposal is to design the next-generation HIV combination prevention
strategies for poor rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa, which will maximize HIV incidence
reduction through identification and targeting of the most vulnerable sub-groups. We envisage
that early identification of emergent vulnerable subpopulations would become a key element for
an effective programmatic response. Our project will take advantage of one of the largest ongoing
population-based HIV cohorts in the world – the Africa Health Research Institute’s population
cohort in rural KwaZulu-Natal, with individual-level sociodemographic, biological, and clinical data
as well as comprehensive genomics data in the fully integrated individual data platform. The
project will leverage the institute’s existing infrastructure and high-resolution data to (i) Quantify
the shifts in the spatial, temporal and demographic burden of new HIV infections (2022-2026);
and (ii) Harness the changes in the dynamics of the HIV epidemic to design future intervention
programs which will maximize HIV incidence reduction based on the dynamic needs of the most
vulnerable sub-populations."
10904626,"Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) have among the highest (5 of the top 10) incarceration rates
worldwide, with staggering numbers of people who inject drugs (PWID), mostly with opioid use disorder (OUD:
82%) and HIV (PWH: 18%). The HIV epidemic in EECA is primarily concentrated in PWID, who account for 56%
of new HIV infections with a high HIV prevalence among PWID (7.3-53.4%). The prisons and probation settings
provide an opportunity for HIV prevention using opioid agonist therapies (OAT). The newly (past 5 years) formed
probation system in these countries presents new opportunities and challenges for HIV prevention as probation
does not have an international mandate to ensure human rights access to HIV prevention and treatment.
 This proposal builds on our existing implementation science network in several EECA countries. Specifically,
first, MAT-LINK used SBIRT (screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment) with trained researchers to
pilot test a strategy to scale-up opioid agonist therapies. Second, many EECA countries have recently introduced
probation, providing opportunities to ensure access to trans-institutionalized persons in probation to better align
public health with public safety. Third, real-world implementation using existing infrastructure and staffing across
more sites is now needed to expand OAT throughout prisons and probation. Fourth, we developed the first
Project ECHO in EECA to guide OAT integration into primary care and psychiatric care into OAT settings.
 We have successfully used the EPIS (Explore, Prepare, Implement and Sustain) framework combined with
the NIATx model of process improvement to scale-up OAT. Also using EPIS, we used Project ECHO to integrate
OAT and HIV care into primary care clinics in Ukraine to teach specialized care to non-specialists, which we
propose to use to teach prison doctors. NIATx is an evidence-informed facilitation strategy with documented
successes in the adoption and scale-up of evidence-based practices (EBPs), like OAT. Using the EPIS
framework and the NIATx approach we propose to: AIM 1: Scale-up OAT as HIV prevention in prisons and pre-
trial detention in EECA and for individuals with OUD and link them to community treatment after release; and
AIM 2: Scale-up OAT as HIV prevention in the newly formed probation system in EECA and for individuals with
OUD and link them to OAT treatment as part of routine care to align public safety and public health.
 We will continue using our network to achieve these goals through collaboration with our partners in EECA.
Significance is high due to the need to reduce HIV transmission in EECA where HIV, PWID and incarceration
are syndemic, which is primarily concentrated in PWID and where OAT coverage is low. Innovation is high by
using the NIATx model to scale-up OAT in prisons and probation, along with collaborative learning tools like
Project ECHO to teach and maintain skills. Feasibility is high due to longstanding collaborations between these
many collaborators and buy-in from CJS settings. Public health benefit is high due to addressing the interface of
health and justice where many of the most vulnerable exist."
10820134,"Warzone Veterans exposed to morally injurious events frequently experience numerous difficulties in
functioning. These Veterans often report suicidal ideation and behavior, substance abuse, symptoms of
depression and PTSD, and problems in resuming valued living (e.g., spiritual practice, close relationships).1-7
Despite the transdiagnostic nature of moral injury, there are no moral injury-specific transdiagnostic
interventions. Existing interventions tend to be focused on treating moral injury in the context of PTSD.10-11
In addition to an emphasis on PTSD, these interventions target beliefs associated with moral injury as causal
factors in the development and maintenance of suffering.10-12 An emphasis on altering beliefs associated with
moral injury may not optimally facilitate functional recovery as moral pain from moral violations may be
justified. As one third of warzone Veterans endorse exposure to morally injurious events, it is vital to develop
interventions that can be efficiently disseminated in VHA to facilitate functional recovery.8-9 The ideal
intervention must simultaneously address moral emotions and promote values consistent behavior in the face
of these emotions.
 Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for moral injury (ACT-MI) is a recovery-based,
psychosocial treatment ideally suited for Veterans endorsing difficulties in functioning related
to moral injury.15 ACT teaches skills to help Veterans relate differently to painful thoughts, emotions, urges,
and sensations.40 Rather than focusing on symptom reduction, ACT is an evidence-based intervention that
directly targets functional recovery by assisting Veterans in identifying and engaging in values-consistent
behavior even in the presence of distress. In Veteran populations specifically, ACT has been demonstrated
effective in treating suicidal ideation and depression and as a result, has been “rolled-out” as an evidence based
psychotherapy for depression within VHA.59-60 ACT-MI operates on the principles of ACT, with an explicit
focus on the social functions of moral emotions.13-14 ACT-MI is the only intervention for moral injury that is
based on social functionalism which purports that moral emotions (e.g., shame, pride) serve evolutionary
purposes essential to group survival.15 Thus learning to interact with moral emotions differently is crucial to
recovery. In ACT-MI, a group-based intervention is used to facilitate in-vivo exposure to moral emotions in the
context of values. The proposed two arm randomized controlled pilot study will evaluate the
acceptability of ACT-MI and an active control treatment, and determine the feasibility of the
randomized controlled trial design for a future full-scale efficacy study. To accomplish this goal we
will continue to refine ACT-MI. Veterans enrolled will be randomized to: (a) Present Centered Therapy (PCT)
or (b) ACT-MI, both of which will consist of 12, 90-minute group sessions.
 The specific aims of this study are to: (1) Evaluate the acceptability of the ACT-MI intervention for
Veterans experiencing impairment in functioning associated with moral injury, (2) Determine the feasibility
of the efficacy study design, and to (3) Select measures and calculate the necessary sample size for a future
efficacy study. The performance of validated scales will be measured, in addition to selected NIH Patient
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System modules.78 All participants will complete a baseline
assessment, post treatment, and follow-up assessment one and three months after completion of ACT-MI or
PCT. Participants in both groups will also complete a post-treatment assessment on the acceptability of the
intervention. The proposed study represents a crucial first step in a line of research likely to yield a recovery-
oriented, empirically-supported intervention for moral injury among Veterans. The objectives of ACT-MI
directly align with Rehabilitation Research and Development's goal to improve Veteran functioning, increase
community reintegration, and to facilitate Veteran centered care."
10849616,"Signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) controls major vital processes in developing and adult eukaryotes
and is involved in a variety of human pathologies. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the classic RTK,
whose signaling and trafficking have been extensively studied, but the molecular mechanisms of endocytosis
and spatiotemporal regulation of signaling processes by endocytosis remain poorly understood. Fundamental
questions of whether signaling is triggered from endosomes by internalized EGFR and how such signaling is
regulated by the endosomal sorting machinery are not addressed. Reciprocally, whether EGFR signaling
regulates endocytic trafficking machinery, remains sparsely studied and controversial. Further, the degree and
rates of the incorporation of EGFR signaling complexes into intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes,
a process that terminates signaling, are also unknown. In the NIGMS funded research, we have developed
single-cell and high-throughput methods to quantitatively monitor endocytic trafficking of endogenous gene-
edited EGFR using a pH-sensitive ratiometric fluorescence excitation model. We used these methods to
elucidate the mechanism of EGFR endocytosis caused by activation of stress-induced p38-MAP kinase and to
determine mechanisms of the crosstalk of this pathway with ligand-induced endocytic pathways. We have
developed a pipeline for generation of gene-edited cells expressing endogenous fluorescently tagged EGFR and
its downstream signaling effectors, and new approaches to examine the dynamics of these components at high
spatial and temporal resolution in living cells. We performed comprehensive phosphoproteomic and proximity
proteome mass-spectrometry screenings to identify signaling effectors and regulators of endosomal EGFR.
Finally, our preliminary experiments using a novel live-cell assay prompted us to hypothesize that EGFR:adaptor
complexes are rapidly incorporated into intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes which diminishes the
capacity of those complexes to signal. These advances have placed us in a unique position to fully define
molecular mechanisms of clathrin-mediated internalization of EGFR, an endocytic pathway of EGFR in vivo, and
address key fundamental questions of whether EGFR signals from endosomes and how this signaling is
terminated. We will exploit the discoveries of the endosomal localization of an actin regulator VAV2 and a protein
of uncertain function, TFG (Trk-gene fusion protein), to define their functions in EGFR signaling from endosomes.
Using our new assay measuring distribution of signaling complexes within multivesicular endosomes in living
cells, we will determine the dynamics of the termination of signaling from endosomal EGFR complexed with
various endogenous fluorescently labeled adaptors and enzymes. Together, proposed studies will lead to a
comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of endocytosis and spatiotemporal regulation of signaling
processes by endocytosis, and will serve as a paradigm to a similar analysis of the whole RTK family."

Translation kinetics critically influences protein structure and function, the rate of mRNA degradation, and
cellular phenotype. When synonymous codon mutations are incorporated into an mRNA molecule (which
changes the rate at which codon positions are translated by the ribosome but not the amino acids they encode)
the specific activity of enzymes changes for long time periods, mRNA degradation rates are altered when these
mutations lead to ribosome traffic jams, and the ability of cells to migrate and maintain a circadian rhythm can
be affected. These effects occur across species, from bacteria to fruit flies, from fungi to humans. What is
missing in this field is a comprehensive, molecular understanding of how translation kinetics influences these
processes. Utilizing both computational (theory, simulation, and big data) and experimental (Mass Spec, Cryo-
EM, and NMR) methods, this proposal focuses on four fundamental questions: (i) Can the existence of a novel
form of protein misfolding, which is suggested to link synonymous mutations and altered protein function, be
experimentally demonstrated? (ii) Can gene expression be altered when such protein misfolding occurs in
transcription factors? (iii) Is it possible to understand and predict how elongation kinetics give rise to different
patterns of ribosome traffic, and how these patterns influence translation-dependent mRNA degradation? (iv)
What molecular mechanisms connect synonymous mutations in humans to changes in growth phenotype?
 Preliminary data suggest clear hypotheses to these questions. For questions (i) and (ii), synonymous
mutations are hypothesized to alter the kinetic partitioning of nascent protein molecules into subpopulations of
misfolded, soluble, self-entangled states that have reduced functionality, which can affect catalysis in the case
of enzymes or DNA promotor binding in the case of transcription factors. For question (iii), application of
interpretable machine learning has suggested molecular factors that can alter both ribosome traffic and mRNA
degradation – which will form the basis for follow up in silico and in vivo testing. And for question (iv),
rigorous statistical methods the PI has used have identified synonymous cancer drivers which provide a unique
opportunity to understand and connect synonymous mutations to cellular phenotype. These hypotheses will be
tested using computational tools including multi-scale simulation techniques, bioinformatics, and machine
learning. And experimentally tested using mass spectrometry, Cryo-EM, NMR, and enzymatic chemotaxis.
 This research will establish a unifying mechanism by which synonymous mutations can alter soluble
protein structure and function over long time periods. It will provide a novel molecular basis by which
synonymous mutations can affect gene expression at the transcriptional level. It will result in a predictive
model connecting non-linear effects between translation kinetics, ribosome traffic, and translation-dependent
mRNA degradation. And finally, it will establish the existence of synonymous cancer drivers affecting human
cell growth phenotype and the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs."
10781911,"Background: The importance of introgression, the evolutionary process by which alleles migrate between
species via hybrids, was debated for decades. Genome sequencing revealed introgression to be pervasive in
eukaryotes. Given its prevalence, we must determine the environmental and genomic factors that regulate its
occurrence.
Broad, long-term objective: Understanding how species form and persist in nature is a premier goal of
evolutionary genetics. Since speciation involves the reduction of introgression between lineages, this question
necessitates an understanding of the factors that regulate gene exchange that occurs when species have the
chance to interbreed. Our research program on Drosophila hybrid zones has the potential of revealing how
species form and what is the importance of introgression in evolution.
Questions and approach: As a field, we are aware that introgression is common in nature. The time is ripe to
understand what are the factors that determine whether an allele can cross species boundaries and thus serve
as raw material for adaptation. The research we are proposing falls into three different categories. First, we will
investigate the dynamics of introgressed alleles along space and time in multiple species. We have geolocated
and timestamped collections from a hybrid zone which will offer the first evidence of its kind to determine how
introgression varies over short periods of time (within 10 years). Second, we will assess whether experimental
hybrid populations can inform the composition of naturally occurring hybrid populations. Finally, we will use
genetic chimeras to study the phenotypic outcomes of introgressed alleles. My group has expertise in method
development to analyze genomic data, genetic analysis of evolutionary processes, and experimental evolution
which makes us well-suited to study what factors determine which alleles can cross species boundaries.
Relevance to human health: Understanding the source of genetic variation is key to understand how new
phenotypes arise. Work from the parent grant demonstrated that introgression is an important source of
variation in many organisms, including human pathogens. This renewal proposes comparative approaches to
identify introgressed loci in multiple taxa, some of which harbor pathogens or are vector species.
Understanding how environmental and human factors influence the exchange of genes for pathogenicity or
vector behavior has relevance to human health in a changing climate.
Impact: The results from this proposal will generate methods and datasets that will be broadly useful, in
addition to helping understand the process of introgression at multiple evolutionary scales. Importantly, the
proposed research moves the field from piecemeal assessments of introgression across particular species
pairs to a synthetic approach that tries to understand how the process interacts with the environment and
whether there are commonalities to across eukaryotes."
10782554,"Generalized ﬂuctuation test for deciphering phenotypic switching within cell populations
The inherent probabilistic nature of biochemical reactions coupled with low-copy number components results in signiﬁcant
random ﬂuctuations (noise) in mRNA/protein levels inside individual cells. How cellular biochemical processes function
reliably in the face of such randomness is an intriguing fundamental problem. A long-term vision of our lab is to develop
new mathematical and computational tools for studying stochastic dynamics of cellular biochemical processes, and use these
tools to systematically understand how noise affects biological function and phenotype. As a consequence of noise in gene
product levels, single cells within an isoclonal population can differ in their expression proﬁle and reside in different pheno-
typic states. The dynamic nature of this intercellular variation, where individual cells can transition between different
states over time makes it a particularly hard phenomenon to characterize. Unexpectedly, phenotypic heterogeneity
within a population can play important functional roles in diverse biological processes, from driving genetically-identical
cells to different cell fates to allowing microbes and cancer cells to hedge their bets against uncertain environmental changes.
The Luria-Delbrück experiment, also called the “Fluctuation Test"", introduced 75 years ago, demonstrated that genetic mu-
tations arise randomly in the absence of selection – rather than in response to selection – and led to a Nobel Prize. The
innovation of this project is to leverage this classical experiment in conjunction with mathematical modeling to char-
acterize reversible and irreversible switching between cell states. The key advantage of the proposed method is that it is
general enough to be applied to any proliferating cell type, and only involves making a single endpoint measurement. This
is especially important for scenarios where a measurement involves killing the cell (for example, assaying whether a bacte-
rial cell is in a drug-sensitive or drug-tolerant state or doing RNA-sequencing), and hence the state of the same cell cannot
be measured at different time points. The project will develop mathematical tools for characterizing phenotypic switching
between an arbitrary number of states using the ﬂuctuation test, and such techniques will for the ﬁrst time differentiate
between an irreversible cell-state transition via genetic alterations vs. a reversible epigenetic transition. These tools
will be ﬁrst benchmarked with in-silico generated data and then applied on experimental datasets investigating diverse prob-
lems, including characterizing drug-tolerant states in bacterial/fungal cells, understanding differences in viral susceptibility
between single human cells within the same clonal population, and uncovering the transient dynamics of stem cell states
that bias individual cells to different differentiation fates. Our preliminary work reveals plasticity in drug-tolerant states
in bacterial, fungal, and cancer cells with different inheritance timescales. To understand the origins of cell states, the
project will develop computational tools for inferring causal interaction networks from single-cell expression data. These
tools will uncover how network topologies change across cell states and modeling the stochastic dynamics of underlying
biochemical networks will mechanistically capture transitions between states. Overall, tools developed through this project
will result in a fundamental understanding of how single-cell difference arises from stochastic epigenetic processes
without any changes to DNA, and drive translational approaches to perturb cell states for therapeutic beneﬁt."

Monocytes and macrophages function in diverse processes, from homeostatic
maintenance to immune responses and tissue regeneration. These functions are
coordinated with and strongly influenced by cellular metabolism via mechanisms that are
increasingly studied and characterized in populations of macrophages. However, such
studies mask the cell-to-cell variation which is an inherent property of macrophage
diversity. Indeed, single-cell transcriptomics data have demonstrated that macrophage
polarization is better described by continuous gradients rather than by discrete states
amenable to isolation and population analysis. Yet, transcriptional measurements are
insufficient to characterize the metabolic and protein networks that shape monocyte and
macrophage diversity. To understand how these networks control macrophage
polarization and functions, we propose to directly quantify proteins and regulatory signals
(such as localization of key regulators, e.g., NF-κB) in primary human monocytes and
macrophages responding to physiologically relevant metabolic environments.
Furthermore, we will extend this single-cell analysis to the responses of these cells to
pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns.
These data will enable us to identify likely regulatory networks driving monocyte and
macrophage responses to metabolic states and molecular patterns. Subsequently, we
will test these networks via pharmacological and genetic perturbations. We are uniquely
positioned to perform this research since we recently pioneered methods for quantifying
thousands of proteins across many single cells. Furthermore, we have the required
expertise in analyzing metabolic systems (including aerobic glycolysis, which is frequently
associated with macrophage activation) and developing new algorithms for data
analysis. This project will advance our understanding of macrophage immunometabolism
and polarization, will introduce methods for more sensitive and accurate single-cell
analysis, and will provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of the possibility to identify
protein-mediated molecular mechanisms at single-cell resolution. We strongly believe
that attaining these goals will have a transformative impact on biomedical research
and will inform new and better therapeutic strategies."
10771939,"Sepsis is the leading cause of death among critically ill patients in the United States, and costs of sepsis for
Medicare beneficiaries exceed $62 billion annually. Outside of antibiotics, treatment for sepsis is non-specific,
and there are no approved therapeutics available once antibiotics and supportive therapy fail. Patients with
cancer are nearly ten times more likely to develop sepsis than the general population, and cancer represents
the most common co-morbidity in septic patients. Moreover, cancer is the co-morbidity associated with the
highest risk of death in sepsis, and the increased mortality is seen disproportionately in younger adult patients.
The gut has long been characterized as the motor of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. All major elements
of gut integrity are altered in sepsis, with dysregulation in the epithelium (permeability, apoptosis, proliferation,
migration), the microbiome and the mucosal immune system. Further, both immunity and gut integrity are
disproportionately impacted in cancer/sepsis hosts compared to previously healthy/sepsis hosts. This program
seeks to understand mechanisms underlying dysregulated gut integrity in sepsis. The first approach will be to
examine what happens within the epithelium, the mucosal immune system and the microbiome, to elucidate
mechanisms of sepsis-induced intestinal alterations within individual processes in isolation. The next approach
will be to examine crosstalk between the three broad components of the gut since each element directly
impacts each other, leading to further alterations in all. The final approach will be to examine how the gut leads
to extra-intestinal effects on distant organs, where gut-derived changes lead to subcellular, cellular and organ
dysfunction, resulting in worsened morbidity and mortality. Additionally, the program seeks to understand why
outcomes are different in cancer/sepsis, by examining differences seen in both the adaptive immune system
and gut integrity. A “one size fits all” approach to an inherently heterogeneous syndrome is likely a key reason
why more progress has not been made in decreasing mortality from sepsis clinically, and the goal of
understanding mechanisms of how a chronic co-morbidity leads to different outcomes at the bedside is to
move towards precision medicine in septic patients. The program will use human samples (gut, blood and
stool) paired when feasible with clinical data and outcomes. Mechanistic questions will then be approached
using a bedside to bench paradigm whereby insights obtained examining human samples will then be
evaluated using a variety of in vivo and in vitro techniques when experiments cannot be performed in patients.
Since the gut plays a major role in both initiating and propagating critical illness and co-morbidities play a
crucial role in worsening outcomes in septic patients, understanding mechanisms through which gut integrity is
dysregulated in sepsis especially in hosts with cancer has significant public health implications in a disease
that is common, very costly, and highly lethal."
10770391,"ABSTRACT
Biological sex, a nearly universal feature of metazoan species, modulates many aspects of animal
development and physiology. It can also bring about resistance or susceptibility to numerous
neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the extent to which
biological sex influences the development and function of the nervous system, the mechanisms by which this
occurs, and the functional consequences of these effects, remain largely unknown. The nematode C. elegans,
with its extraordinarily well characterized nervous system, powerful experimental tractability, and conserved
genetic mechanisms, provides outstanding opportunities to address these questions. C. elegans adults of both
sexes share a core group of 294 neurons; superimposed on this, each sex has a complement of sex-specific
neurons that implement sex-specific behavior. Recent research from our group and others has found that the
influence of biological sex on the C. elegans nervous system goes far beyond these overt neuroanatomical
dimorphisms. We have found not only that neurons and circuits shared by both sexes are modulated by
biological sex, but also that this is a consequence of the sexual state of the nervous system itself, rather than
signals from other tissues. Chemosensory function is an important target of this modulation, but multiple lines
of evidence indicate that the effects of sex on shared circuits are not limited to this. These findings reveal a
previously unappreciated aspect of C. elegans neurobiology and raise many interesting new questions,
particularly regarding the role of biological sex in sensory integration, behavioral state, and decision-making,
that these studies will address. Further, recent results have indicated that, at a molecular level, the internal
representation of biological sex is surprisingly flexible, such that the sexual state of individual neurons may be
responsive to both developmental and environmental signals. We will study the functional significance of this
flexibility as well as the regulatory programs that underlie it, which involve a novel long non-coding RNA that
may be part of a conserved, cell-autonomous developmental timing mechanism. Together, these studies will
provide new insight into the ways in which biological sex interacts with developmental and physiological
programs to bring about sex-specific cellular, circuit, and behavioral features. As such, they will provide an
important framework for understanding how these poorly understood mechanisms operate in more complex
animals, including humans. In turn, this will help provide insight into how sex-typical features of the human
brain could confer protection or susceptibility to a variety of nervous system disorders."
10771116,"For many years Freed has pioneered the development of electron-spin resonance (ESR) methods for the study
of proteins and their dynamical effects on membranes. The goal of this proposal is to use those ESR techniques
to advance our knowledge of 1) viral membrane fusion and 2) Intrinsic Disordered Protein (IDP)-membrane
interactions in conjunction with other biophysical methods.
 The ongoing COVID19 pandemic has unveiled how limited are our knowledge and methods to combat
emerging infectious diseases caused by viral pathogens. A key step in SARS-CoV-2 (“SARS-2”) viral infection is
membrane fusion initiated by its fusion peptide (FP) domain in its Spike protein. In fact, membrane fusion is
key for all enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-1 (“SARS-1”), MERS-CoV, EBOV, influenza and HIV. However,
the mechanism of viral membrane fusion is still unclear. We have extensively demonstrated that FP-induced
membrane ordering is a prerequisite for viral membrane fusion in all these viruses. We have shown that
membrane ordering for some viruses including SARS-1, MERS and EBOV is strongly Ca2+-dependent. Most
recently we have shown that SARS-2 FP interacts with membranes more strongly than SARS-1, and it depends
very specifically on Ca2+. However, the exact role of Ca2+, as well as the mechanism of membrane ordering are
still unclear. The FP only initiates membrane fusion. We have proposed that the transmembrane domain (TMD)
of influenza hemagglutinin is important for finalizing membrane fusion. However, this remains to be tested to
see if it is applicable to SARS-2. Thus, we plan to continue studies of the mechanism of membrane fusion of
SARS-2 as well as other Ca2+-dependent viruses.
 IDPs lack a stable tertiary structure in solution. After membrane binding, they can either undergo a disorder-
to-order transition or still remain in the absence of a stable structure. The viral FPs are such examples. This IDP-
membrane interaction localizes IDPs to their target membranes, facilitating interactions with other membrane
proteins, and helping to remodel membrane properties. Understanding the structure/function relationships
underlying IDP-membrane interactions is a significant challenge because of their highly variable and dynamic
nature. We have been using complexin, a key exocytosis regulator related to neurodegeneration, as a model to
delineate the IDP-membrane binding mode. We have found that complexins from different organisms have very
different modes, which is likely to reflect their different biological functions. We plan to continue to study the
membrane-binding C-terminal domain of complexins of several species to determine the mechanisms that
govern complexin-membrane binding modes. These findings will be useful for human therapies.
 ESR is a powerful methodology to study the dynamic and structural properties of SARS FPs and other IDPs, as
we have shown. We will employ our well-developed ESR methods to achieve these goals. This will be
supplemented by other biophysical methods, including Isothermal Titration Calorimetry and Circular Dichroism."
10769717,"The emergence of the neocortex and its capacity to be shaped by early sensory and motor experience is the
hallmark of mammalian brain evolution. This remarkable plasticity allows the neocortex to be constructed for a
multi-sensory context, and to generate flexible behavior throughout a lifetime. While it is well established that
early sensory experience can alter the functional organization of sensory and motor cortex, most studies have
focused on either the somatosensory or the motor system in isolation, and almost exclusively studied animals
reared in relatively restricted laboratory environments. Thus, the extent to which the sensory complexity,
variability, and affordances of the early environment impact neural and behavioral development is unknown.
Also, whether these types of dynamic environments can increase the capacity for behavioral plasticity
throughout a lifetime has never been explored. In the current proposal, rats will be born and reared in two
distinct environments; a laboratory cage, or in a large, highly enriched, semi-natural outdoor enclosure. We
will determine if the speed with which an animal learns a sensory motor task, the accuracy of performance, and
strategy by which novel tasks are learned correlate with, and can predict, differences in the functional
organization, neural response properties and connections of the neocortex. We focus on areas involved in
sensorimotor integration and motor control that we believe will be highly impacted by rearing condition: the
primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and motor cortex (M1). We will use electrophysiological recording
techniques to examine the somatotopic organization and neural response properties of S1, and intracortical
microstimulation techniques to determine how muscle synergies are represented in M1 and S1. We will also
quantify differences in the neuroanatomical connections of M1 and S1 with other cortical fields within and
across hemispheres, as well as with the dorsal thalamus and spinal cord. Finally, to determine when these
distinct environments have the greatest impact on the functional organization and connections of S1 and M1,
we will examine animals at 4 important developmental time points and as adults. These studies will uncover
when and how early sensory experience coupled with diverse motor opportunities impact cortical organization
and connectivity in the developing brain to generate context-appropriate behavior; and if dynamic and complex
sensorimotor environments generate brains and bodies capable of a larger degree of behavioral plasticity
throughout a lifetime."
10788416,"Functional dissection of fibronectin type 3 domains of SORL1 in Alzheimer's
 disease associated microglia
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial, complex disease and a leading cause of dementia
among aged people. There are no effective pharmacotherapeutic options for prevention and
treatment of AD due to lack of complete understanding of disease mechanisms. Interestingly,
Genome wide association studies have established that the majority of AD associated loci are
found in or near genes that are highly/uniquely expressed in microglia (resident macrophage cells
of brain) suggesting the critical role of these cells in disease progression. SORL1 is genetically
implicated in late and early onset forms of AD. Studies on postmortem brain tissues have shown
reduced levels of SORL1 in AD patient brains. Although, among brain cells microglia show
highest expression of SORL1, yet little is known how this protein regulates microglia phenotypes
during health and disease. Our preliminary data suggest, that a specific isoform of SORL1 is
enriched in microglia and it physically interact through its FN3 domain with WAVE regulator
complex (WRC). WRC is emerging as critical regulator of cell migration and phagocytic response
hence can serve as therapeutic target for tuning up phenotypes of AD related microglia. In this
application, we propose to: (1) determine the molecular mechanism by which SORL1 regulate
microglia functions e.g. phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and cytokine expression; (2) Measure SORL-
FN3 abundance in AD and non-AD brain microglia from cohorts of deeply characterized
individuals (ROSMAP) to establish the relationship among FN3 abundance vs. AD related traits;
(3) Identify therapeutic targets within SORL1-WRC using our newly developed CRISPR-mediated
saturating mutagenesis approach.
Overall, by leveraging innovative CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technologies (1 & 3) and novel
SRM (selected reaction monitoring) based quantitative proteomics and genetics (2) this proposal
will accelerate the transition of genetic discoveries to molecular mechanism that can open new
avenues for novel therapeutics for AD."
10800796,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The goal of this international collaborative project, in response to PAR-20-027, is to characterize the genetic
architecture of schizophrenia in the Xhosa population of South Africa. The three participating sites have
already successfully established the infrastructure necessary to undertake the aims of this proposal: University
of Washington, Seattle (Mary-Claire King, Jack McClellan, Tom Walsh, MPIs); Columbia University, New York
(Ezra Susser, PI); and University of Cape Town, South Africa (Dan Stein, PI).
African populations harbor far more genetic variation than out-of-Africa populations, facilitating discovery of
associations between genotypes and phenotypes. Our initial study (Gulsuner at al., Science, 2020) was the
first large-scale genetic study of schizophrenia in an ancestral African population. We discovered that Xhosa
individuals with schizophrenia (cases) are enriched for rare damaging mutations in genes intolerant to such
mutations. The effect was particularly strong for damaging mutations in genes involved in synaptic functioning.
These results extend understanding of schizophrenia genetics, specifically supporting an oligogenic, severe
alleles model and a role for rare damaging mutations in genes critical to synaptic signaling and plasticity.
For this project, we propose to enroll an additional 1250 cases and 1250 age- and gender-matched controls, all
Xhosa-speaking, bringing our total study population to 5425 participants. We will apply new genomic
technology to identify previously undetectable classes of mutations likely to be implicated in schizophrenia. The
genomic structure of Xhosa cases and controls will be characterized using whole genome sequencing (wgs),
both short–read Illumina wgs to identify conventional classes of mutations and long-read PacBio wgs to identify
structural variants of all types, mobile transposable elements, and repeat expansions. In addition, SAX v2, the
African-variation-enriched SNP array developed for this project by Affymetrix, will be used to identify copy
number variants (CNVs).
Africa is the single most informative continent for understanding the human genome and human disorders with
worldwide impact. African populations provide the most complete human reference genomes for screening
candidate risk alleles for any phenotype. The whole-genome sequencing strategies used in this project allow
the comparison of all classes of damaging mutations between cases and controls, including the detection of
case-specific copy number variation and repeat expansions, while also providing a resource for human
genomics research worldwide."

In the last two decades, there has been an increased appreciation of a long-term threat, that of non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), evolving into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can further advance into
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Treatment of NAFLD and NASH is primarily through attempts at
nutritional modification, often unsuccessful due to poor compliance and socioeconomic factors. There is
currently no accepted single-agent pharmacologic treatment for NAFLD. The current proposal is based on
findings from our work on liver regeneration, in which we discovered a unique role for EGFR for control of
steatosis in replicating hepatocytes. We have now extended these studies in mice fed a high fat diet
supplemented with fructose in the drinking water (“Fast Food Diet”, FFD). We found that in mice on FFD,
concurrent EGFR inhibition completely prevented and eliminated any fat deposition in hepatocytes.
Furthermore, EGFR inhibition reversed severe hepatocyte steatosis established after FFD feeding for 4
months. Detail analysis of the mechanisms revealed widespread effects of EGFR inhibition on multiple
transcription factors related to lipid metabolism and subsequent consequences to specific enzymes associated
with lipid biosynthesis and degradation. No such findings occur when signaling from the other of the two
hepatocyte-mitogenic receptor tyrosine kinases, MET (the HGF receptor), was eliminated. The purpose of this
proposal is to explore translational applications of this finding. This will be done by exploring effects of EGFR
inhibitors established in human pharmacology. In addition, we will conduct parallel analysis between EGFR
and MET signaling inhibition on their effects of NAFLD, aiming to uncover specific pathways unique to EGFR
that may reveal new pharmacologic approaches more focused than the inhibition of the entire EGFR signaling
with its potentially adverse complications. In parallel studies, we will also use available human NAFLD/NASH
tissue material available in the Biorepository of our Pittsburgh Liver research Center (PLRC). This material will
be used under the established rules of IRB obtained by PLRC for such studies. We will explore activation of
EGFR dependent pathways and will correlate with the histology of NAFLD/NASH. A serious complication of
progression of NAFLD to NASH is development of fibrosis. We have uncovered EGFR-controlled signaling
molecules in steatotic hepatocytes, which have been associated with activation of hepatic stellate cells and
enhanced production of collagens. These also offer opportunities for selective pharmacology for fibrosis and
their relevance will be assessed in the studies proposed."
10771108,"Abstract
 Glutathione (GSH) is the master antioxidant in the body and mainly produced in hepatocytes. Constant
efflux of hepatic glutathione into the blood stream allows the redox potential of the entire body to be precisely
controlled. Thus, depletion of hepatic glutathione has found to strongly correlate with an increased susceptibility
to oxidative stress and high risk of many diseases such as liver injuries, immunodeficiency, Parkinson’s disease
and infectious diseases. However, since hepatic glutathione is diluted more than two orders in the blood plasma
and consumed by different organs, unlike conventional liver serum biomarkers, this crucial pathophysiological
event cannot be readily monitored through blood testing even through it could be used to predict disease
progression much earlier than conventional serum markers. Until now, in the preclinical research, a large number
of animals have to be sacrificed; so that fresh liver tissues can be collected for ex vivo quantification of the
glutathione level. In clinical research, C13 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and nuclear imaging are
being developed to indirectly measure GSH level; however, such high-end instrumentation and special skill sets
preclude the translation of the pathophysiological significance of hepatic glutathione depletion from laboratories
into the clinics, in particular, those with limited resources, for early disease management. The objective of this
proposal is to develop an innovative nanotechnology that empowers blood testing to serve as a simple and
rapid tool for noninvasive and consecutive monitoring of hepatic glutathione depletion; so that hepatic glutathione
depletion could be readily monitored in the clinics through blood test and be used as an earlier indicator for
diagnosis of liver and other oxidative-stress related diseases, which are influencing hundreds of millions of
people in the world."
10796786,"ABSTRACT: The major goal of this proposal is to investigate the potential for teixobactin, our newly discovered
antibiotic, to treat respiratory infections. As reported in 2019 by the CDC, pneumonia caused by drug resistant
Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are considered
serious threats. In addition, respiratory bacterial co-infections with Covid-19 have recently been recognized as a
significant problem. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are two other respiratory pathogens
particularly problematic in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and are common causes of
community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).
 The most remarkable, and unexpected property of teixobactin is the lack of any detectable resistance to
this compound. Teixobactin hits two related targets—lipid II, precursor of peptidoglycan and lipid III, precursor of
wall teichoic acid. These highly conserved targets are not mutable—they are not proteins and are not directly
coded by DNA. Since our discovery of teixobactin, we and others have failed to generate resistant mutants in
any species including S. aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Bacillus anthracis. Teixobactin is highly
efficacious in animal models of thigh, lung and blood infections. Animal infection models predict that the human
dose of teixobactin for acute skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) will be very low (≤1 mg/kg/day), which
is advantageous, as a low dose may minimize side effects and reduce manufacturing costs.
 Teixobactin is in preclinical development as an intravenous (IV) drug for treating skin infections caused
by pathogens such as MRSA. A pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) meeting with FDA was held in December
2018 whereby the FDA generally agreed with our development plan. An IND submission for ABSSSI is planned
for 2022.
 In this project, Aim 1 will produce enough teixobactin for all the proposed studies. Aim 2 will conduct
efficacy and PK/PD studies in animal models of pneumonia. Aim 3 will test in vitro susceptibility, bactericidal
activity, post antibiotic effect (PAE) and resistance in recent clinical isolates from respiratory infections. Aim 4
will prepare and submit an IND application for intravenous treatment of a respiratory infection. Aim 5 will explore
alternative routes of TXB administration (inhalation and intramuscular delivery), which would be particularly
useful for outpatient treatment of respiratory and other infections. With successful completion of these projects,
we will have demonstrated the promise of teixobactin for treating drug resistant respiratory infections and
explored more convenient routes of TXB administration."
10765731,"Project Summary/Abstract
The main objective of the proposed studies is the elucidation of fundamental processes of translation,
translational regulation and translational quality control. To this end, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy,
the technique pioneered in the PI's lab, is used in collaborations with world specialists on bacterial and
eukaryotic translation. We make use of two techniques of sample preparation, standard and time-resolved
cryo-EM. In the standard application of cryo-EM, samples are pipetted onto the grid, excess liquid is removed
by blotting, and the grid is then plunged into the cryogen. Since this procedure requires several seconds, it is
not possible to capture short-lived (less than 1000 millisecond) states of a molecule following a reaction. The
alternative technique developed in this lab is time-resolved cryo-EM, whereby a reaction is started by mixing
two components in a microfluidic chip, allowing them to react in a channel of defined, variable length (10 to
1000 ms), and then spraying the reaction products onto the grid as the latter in plunged into the cryogen. In
this way, the kinetics of a reaction can be followed and, at the same time, intermediate states can be captured
and visualized at high resolution. These two techniques are used to study the following processes: translation
initiation in E. coli and yeast, translation termination, recycling and quality control in mammalian, EMCV virus
takeover of the host's ribosome. Another objective of the proposed studies is the exploration of a novel method
of data analysis that seeks to generate a low-dimensional map of states existing in a continuum from a large
dataset of single-particle cryo-EM images of a biological macromolecule. Such a mapping can be used to
determine the free-energy landscape of the molecule, containing information on the function-related
conformational trajectories. This method will be applied in collaborations with leading experts to two
membrane-associated molecules with eminent biological and public health significance: rotary ATPase and
Cystic Fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTR)."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem affecting ~850 million people including 37
million Americans. Advanced CKD results in a number of adverse clinical outcomes leading to high rates of
mortality, morbidity, and healthcare expenditure. Recognizing these staggering challenges, the Department of
Health and Human Services initiated the “Advancing American Kidney Health (AAKH)” through Executive
Order in July 2019. Derangements in iron metabolism are a hallmark of advanced CKD, however, the
mechanistic underpinnings of such perturbations and their clinical impact on the course of CKD are not fully
understood. The overall goal of this project is to fill the current gaps in knowledge and address this unmet need
for the development of novel therapeutic interventions by targeting iron metabolism to slow progression of CKD
and delay the need for kidney replacement therapy, two of the major goals of the AAKH initiative. By
conducting preliminary studies, we have discovered that macrophage ferritin heavy chain (FtH) diminishes
development and progression of CKD. Guided by our findings we propose the unifying hypothesis that myeloid
FtH orchestrates iron distribution and regulates macrophage plasticity under injurious/inflammatory conditions.
This premise is substantiated by (i) significant upregulation of Spic, a lineage-defining transcription factor that
selectively controls development of iron recycling macrophages and (ii) marked elevation and aggregation of
synuclein-alpha (Snca), a common pro-inflammatory factor in neurodegenerative conditions in in two models of
CKD with substantially higher levels observed in kidneys of mice with targeted deletion of FtH in myeloid
compartment. To confirm our hypothesis, we will execute the following specific aims: Aim 1: To test the
hypothesis that myeloid FtH regulates monocyte/MΦ differentiation towards iron recycling phenotype through
controlling transcription factor Spic. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that myeloid FtH establishes disease
tolerance to CKD via suppression of Snca. Successful completion of the proposed aims will have a significant
impact on our understanding of the individual and collective effects of myeloid FtH, Spic and Snca expression
in iron handling by the kidney and their detailed connotative roles in the pathogenesis of CKD, thereby paving
the way for a new therapeutic approach in this disease by targeting iron metabolism in CKD."
10783053,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In B lymphopoiesis there are alternating and mutually exclusive state of stochastic immunoglobulin gene
recombination and cell proliferation with selection. Following successful rearrangement of the Ig heavy chain
gene, Igµ pairs with surrogate light chain (SLC) to form the pre-BCR, expression of which is associated with
clonal large pre-B cell expansion. However, at the subsequent developmental stage, small pre-B cells must fully
exit cell cycle before initiating Ig light chain (IgL) gene recombination. Failure to do so risks genomic instability
and leukemic transformation. Work from our lab and others has demonstrated that the IL-7R drives proliferation
while the pre-BCR primarily appears tasked with IgL recombination. However, there is an apparent paradox in
that IgL rearrangement occurs in small pre-B cells in which there is concurrent strong repression of SLC. There
are two possibilities. The pre-BCR could initiate a complex developmental program in large pre-B cells that is
executed in small pre-B cells. Alternatively, there could be other receptors or mechanisms that orchestrate IgL
chain recombination. We now demonstrate that CXCR4, which is upregulated in small pre-B cells, directly
transmits signals that open Igk to recombination. Indeed, it is CXCR4-mediated ERK activation, and not escape
from IL-7, nor expression of the pre-BCR, that mediates late B lymphopoiesis. These and other data suggest a
new model of B lymphopoiesis in which sequential signaling through three receptors, the IL-7R, pre-BCR and
CXCR4, orchestrate critical cell fate decisions. We propose to test this mode in the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Identify the signaling pathways specifically downstream of the pre-BCR.
Aim 2: Determine how CXCR4 signals integrate with pre-BCR/IL-7Resc to drive Igk recombination.
Aim 3. Determine how CXCR4 regulates receptor editing."

Lung transplantation (LTx) is the only therapeutic option for patients with end-stage lung disease and idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common indication in North America. However, IPF lung transplant recipients
(IPF-LTRs) have worse transplant survival compared to all other lung diseases. Mutations in the genes
responsible for telomere maintenance are the most common identifiable cause of IPF and our group recently
showed that lung transplantation enriches for patients with telomere-mediated disease with as many as a quarter
of patients having an identifiable rare variant. Patients with defects in telomere-maintenance genes have an
array of immunologic abnormalities that render them susceptible to viral infections. Despite having a weakened
immune system, these patients have been reported to reject donor lungs at similar or faster rates than individuals
without telomere-mediated disease. The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon are unknown. Based on
our preliminary data, we hypothesize that lung transplantation unmasks a complex syndrome that impacts viral
host defense, immunosuppression tolerance and allograft rejection. Further, we hypothesize that impaired
adaptive immunity is exacerbated by Cytomegalovirus infection by augmenting immunosenescence, however
alloimmune and other immune mechanisms can offset and facilitate lung rejection outcomes in transplant
recipients with short telomeres. We have divided our approach into three related and synergistic aims. In Aim 1,
we examine the consequences of primary CMV infection in patients with telomere-mediate disease and test if
two hits, telomere dysfunction and CMV infection, cooperate to drive immune senescence. In Aim 2, we explore
the mechanisms that are responsible for lung rejection in individuals with weakened immune systems. Finally,
in Aim 3, we test if our recent findings from the University of Pittsburgh can be replicated and extended in a multi-
center group of patients from the Lung Transplant Outcomes Group and examine keep outcomes following lung
transplantation when stratified by genetic findings and telomere length. We expect that these studies will help
improve care and outcomes in patients with telomere-mediated disease."

Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the etiological agent of Lyme disease, maintains itself in nature via a complex life cycle
involving an arthropod (tick) vector and small mammals. During its cycle between ticks and mammals, Bb
undergoes dramatic adaptive changes in order to interact with and adapt to these two disparate niches.
Previously, we found that BadR, a homologue of ROK repressors, binds to the rpoS promoter region and
represses the expression of rpoS. Moreover, our preliminary findings have suggested that BadR has much
broader biological relevance to the life cycle of Bb other than repressing rpoS expression. First, BadR is required
for Bb's optimal growth. Second, BadR plays a vital role in the establishment of mammalian infection. Contrary
to the wild-type strain, a badR deletion mutant is incapable of infecting mice, suggesting that BadR governs
expression of key effector proteins associated with Bb's survival in the host. Phenotypic defects of the badR
mutant in mice infection are NOT related to the well documented RpoN-RpoS regulatory pathway, because all
of BosR, Rrp2, RpoN, and RpoS are still produced in the badR mutant. In fact, our preliminary global
transcriptomic analyses using RNA-seq have identified numerous BosR/RpoS-independent genes regulated by
BadR. In addition, we found that badR is expressed throughout Bb's tick-mammal infectious cycle. These
combined data give rise to our hypothesis that BadR is a master regulator governing Bb's host adaption and
virulence expression. This hypothesis will be addressed in two Specific Aims. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will
employ global transcriptome/proteome profiling to define the entire BadR regulon under various in vitro and in
vivo conditions. In Aim 2, we will select BadR-regulated genes based on our global transcriptome/proteome
analyses and characterize their contributions to Bb's infectious cycle. These combined studies will (i) refine our
knowledge on BadR-mediated gene regulation; (ii) provide a transformative understanding of the in vivo
importance of the regulon; and (iii) identify novel virulence determinants. Resultant findings could lead to the
development of new strategies to prevent and/or treat Lyme disease."
10788454,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a devastating clonal plasma cell (cPC) malignancy responsible for over 13,000
deaths in the US per year. It is always preceded by pre-malignant, asymptomatic plasma cell disorders such as
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM).
Despite the availability of various clinical, genomic, and imaging-based risk stratification models, accurate
classification of precursor cPC disorders and their risk of progression to MM remains elusive. The fundamental
roadblock remains in the inability of existing clinical and laboratory-based biomarkers to distinguish between
the presence of premalignant or malignant cPCs in patients. In contrast, recent advances in mass-
spectrometry based metabolomics offers new opportunities to characterize intra- and extracellular metabolites
that could serve as novel biomarkers reflective of the presence of malignant cPCs. This is especially promising
since oncogenic drivers of progression of premalignant to malignant cPCs, such as c-Myc, has known
downstream effects on multiple intracellular metabolic pathways resulting in altered extracellular metabolite
levels. These resultant metabolite profiles can be exploited to more accurately assess the risk of progression of
precursor cPC disorders to MM in the future and ultimately affect management and treatment. Thus, this
research proposal will test the hypothesis that the levels of select metabolites within the bone marrow (BM)
plasma are reflective of the qualitative and quantitative presence of c-Myc-activated malignant cPCs in patients
with PC disorders. This research proposal will specifically validate the presence of differences in the levels of
select metabolites in the BM plasma between MGUS and MM patients (Aim 1). It will also evaluate the effect of
c-Myc activation in cPCs on their extracellular levels of these select metabolites (Aim 2). Finally, it will evaluate
how depleting the malignant cPCs with systemic therapy affects the BM plasma levels of these select
metabolites in MM (Aim 3). These studies will provide an opportunity to advance our understanding of the
metabolic rewiring associated with the pathogenesis of MM. This could allow us to better determine the
transition from MGUS to symptomatic MM for the development of potential early diagnostic or preventative
strategies. The expertise and resources of the members of the team, the availability of the Myeloma SPORE
biobank and a NIH-designated comprehensive metabolomics core at the Mayo Clinic ensures the viability and
execution of the proposed experiments."
10768753,"Identifying how genetic variation leads to neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders provides new means to
study, predict, prevent and treat disease. Identifying the immediate molecular consequences of disease-
associated genetic variation has necessitated the development of large-scale, multi-tissue functional genomic
resources. Projects such as GTEx, Roadmap Epigenomics Project and PsychENCODE have combined
molecular QTL mapping and epigenomic maps in bulk tissues to interpret various disease-associated genetic
variants. However, few colocalizations between molecular QTLs and traits have been robustly identified and
few causal variants mapped. As tissues like the brain constitute 100s of cell-types, we hypothesize that
existing maps may mask the contributions of disease-associated variation in less-abundant cell types. One
extremely powerful approach to identify cell-type specific molecular effects and their relationship to genetic
diseases is through application of chromatin accessibility data – these data both allow inference of causal cell
types and provide base level resolution gene regulation. Our team has considerable expertise in connecting
GWAS to molecular functions and predicting causal variants through use of chromatin accessibility data. We
have additionally recently collaborated to generate a comprehensive, multi-individual map single cell ATAC-
seq map (scATAC-seq) of six different brain regions to detect causal cell types and predict causal variants.
This work has been recently demonstrated in our fine-mapping study of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease
(Corces et al, bioRxiv, 2020) but has not been systematically applied to mental health disorders. We propose
to develop statistical genetics and machine learning approaches that advance the use of scATAC-seq data to
connecting mental health GWAS loci to specific cell types, mechanisms and causal variants. In Aim 1, we will
assemble a pipeline that leverages region and cell type-specific scATAC-seq data to identify pathological cell
types for 100s of mental health and brain-related traits. We will also enhance the detection of cell-type specific
molecular mechanisms by extending and applying a novel GWAS/QTL colocalization approach. Throughout
these activities, variants will be validated using massively-parallel reporter assays (MPRA). In Aim 2, we will
develop sophisticated machine learning models that learn regulatory grammars and score variants across the
allele frequency spectrum. Predicted causal variants in GWAS loci will be further assessed with MPRAs in Aim
1 and applied in Aim 3. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate how improved detection of causal variants using our
single-cell informed models aids transferability of polygenic risk scores across populations.
 We will provide open resources and reproducible computational methods and pipelines that integrate
single cell chromatin accessibility data from multiple brain regions. This will allow detection cell-type specific
genetic effects and pathological cell types in mental health GWAS, establish robust causal links between
variants, genes and disease, and improve prediction of disease risk."

Fast gradient-echo MRI is the preferred method to visualize iron deposition in human brain tissue with
susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), to map functional activity with echo-planar imaging (EPI) and to assess
cranial nerve disorders with steady-state free precession (SSFP) MRI. However, its high susceptibility towards
B0 magnetic field inhomogeneity poses serious challenges. Particularly strong and localized B0 deviations are
observed above the sinus cavities in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain area involved in many higher order
cognitive functions, and the orbits comprising, among others, eyes and cranial nerves. Spatial image
deformation and signal dropout induced by inhomogeneous B0 conditions can severely limit gradient-echo MRI
quality and even render results useless, thereby fundamentally limiting its diagnostic potential. We have
recently made major advances in the ability to obtain high levels of B0 homogeneity throughout the brain,
including difficult-to-shim areas such as the PFC using a novel multi-coil hardware in combination with rapid B0
optimization methods and dynamic shimming. B0 shimming with this Dynamic Multi-Coil Technique
(DYNAMITE) provides dramatically better B0 homogeneity than standard methods and in the future should
close to completely eliminate B0 inhomogeneity as a problem. Our objective in this proposal is to combine
DYNAMITE B0 shim with clinical RF technology to establish the first integrated multi-coil B0 and radio-
frequency (MC/RF) setup dedicated to clinical diagnostics and workflow. Specific Aim 1: Electromagnetic field
(EMF) simulations will be used to compare and optimize the potential of generating DYNAMITE B0 shim fields
with a dedicated multi-coil B0 setup separate from the employed RF coil, by driving elements of an RF phased
array with DC currents or a combination thereof in a hybrid approach, considering electromagnetic coupling
and safety. Specific Aim 2: Computer-aided design (CAD) methods comprising electromagnetic, thermal and
mechanical modeling will be used to realize the optimized MC/RF constellation for a clinical 3T MR scanner
environment, providing diagnostic MRI capability in an efficient, reliable and safe fashion. Moreover,
DYNAMITE B0 shimming tailored to routine clinical MRI protocols is expected to improve the overall image
quality throughout the human brain compared to conventional spherical harmonic-based B0 shim technology.
Specific Aim 3: DYNAMITE B0 shimming will be applied to diagnostic imaging of optic nerve diseases as part
of routine protocols and workflow in a fully automated fashion transparent to the medical staff to test the
hypothesis of enhanced diagnostic potential and a true clinical benefit due to MRI artifact mitigation. The
approach is innovative because the best available B0 shimming and RF technologies are combined to provide
unprecedented clinical MRI capabilities. The research is significant because it is expected to fundamentally
leverage the diagnostic potential of gradient-echo MRI in the ventral PFC and orbits, setting the stage for
widespread clinical use of state-of-the-art B0 shim technology and true translation from bench to bedside."

Discouraging results from the Survey of Earned Doctorates revealed that in 2020, only 3.2% of those awarded
doctoral degrees in the biological / biomedical sciences were Black or African-Americans and 6.2% were
Hispanics or Latinos. For those awarded doctoral degrees in the health sciences, 9.4% were Black or African-
Americans and 4.8% were Hispanics or Latinos. There continues to be an urgent need to create a diverse
biomedical research workforce. The University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School has a highly successful
NIH funded Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in the Morningside Graduate School of
Biomedical Sciences. This proven program offers an outstanding opportunity to enhance student academic
preparedness and increase laboratory-based or clinical research experience. The goal of the program is to
prepare students so that they are competitive for admission into top-tier PhD or MD/PhD programs. We seek
continued NIH funding to expand our research education training program. The goals of the UMass Chan PREP
are: 1) Promote the scientific development of trainees from traditionally underrepresented groups; 2) Support
the transition of these trainees into leading PhD and MD/PhD training programs; 3) Support the self-identification
of these scholars as scientists, resulting in their sustained achievement and persistence in biomedical sciences
careers. UMass Chan PREP will achieve these goals by providing PREP scholars with strong mentoring teams;
high-caliber research experiences within research-intensive UMass Chan Medical School Departments, Centers,
and Institutes; academic training tailored to their research goals and their previous educational and research
experiences; and opportunities to hone technical and professional skills (e.g. writing, presentations, time
management). Importantly, UMass Chan PREP offers support as they refine their identities as scientists through
discussions related to gender, race/ethnicity, and other aspects of diversity. Sessions on imposter syndrome,
intersectionality, and guidance on navigating graduate school (e.g., learning self-advocacy, managing mentoring
relationships) are important sessions that enhance preparedness for success in graduate school. Our breadth
of mentors, scientific disciplines, and academic programs offers the flexibility to individualize each trainee’s
experience while providing a strong foundation to increase the likelihood of future academic and research
success. We expect that we will continue to have at least 75% of our PREP scholars matriculate and successfully
complete graduate programs contributing to the diversification of the trainee population, and workforce, in the
biomedical and behavioral sciences."

This proposal seeks continued support for the Postbaccalaueate program at Brown University (renamed
‘PREP@Brown) to advance our work in developing a diverse pool of knowledgeable and well-trained individuals
who go on to pursue Ph.D. degree training and careers in the biomedical sciences. This work responds to the
need to expand and diversify the U.S. STEM workforce. Informed by best practices and lessons learned from
our early work and relationships with our IMSD program and the Leadership Alliance, we describe an innovative
program characterized by a comprehensive and customizable set of interventions to support and advance
underrepresented students' academic and career development and success.
Each year, our program will recruit and support six research-oriented baccalaureate graduates from
underrepresented backgrounds (The Scholars) and provide them with interdisciplinary research experiences,
individualized academic planning, professional development, and skill-building activities to increase their
competitiveness and readiness for high-caliber doctoral programs. Participating departments for Brown's
PREP@Brown program are those in the Life and Medical Sciences Division and include biology, neuroscience,
molecular microbiology and immunology, pathobiology, public health, and cognitive, linguistic, and psychological
sciences. In addition to intensive interdisciplinary research experiences and knowledge development, multiple
mentorship and community-building opportunities permeate the activities of PREP@Brown. This will create a
community of scholars that will help Participants successfully navigate training needed for readiness for graduate
studies. The use of Individual Development Plans (IDP) will ensure that PREP@Brown research, educational
and professional development activities are tailored to address each Scholar’s academic and career goals. The
PREP@Brown Program will also create opportunities for faculty to engage in conversations about the importance
of developing a diverse workforce in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. We have developed a
comprehensive evaluation plan to assess outcomes and progress toward meeting the overall goal and aims of
this project and monitor quality assurance across the proposed interventions.
As designed, PREP@Brown has begun to, and will continue to increase the production of underrepresented
students who obtain a doctoral degree in the biomedical sciences; institutionalize best practices on training and
mentoring of diverse scholars – practices that can be shared among the Brown community and beyond."
10782439,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cholinergic neurons (ChIs) are a central but poorly understood element of striatal circuitry. A considerable
literature strongly implicates ChI dysfunction in the pathogenesis of abnormal movements, especially in dystonia
and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson disease. A common theme of these studies is that maladaptive
plastic changes cause aberrant ChI output and connectivity, promoting motor dysfunction. The central goal of
this proposal is to advance understanding of the cellular and synaptic mechanisms through which ChIs cause
motor dysfunction by employing novel selective genetic and chemical strategies in a recently validated model of
DYT1 dystonia.
Conditional Knock Out of torsinA from all striatal neurons (using Dlx5/6-Cre; “Dlx-CKO”) causes selective
neurodegeneration of dorsolateral striatal ChI. ChI degeneration occurs roughly coincident with the juvenile onset
of abnormal twisting movements in these mice, and selective ChI abnormalities are also present in postmortem
tissue from DYT1 subjects. These movements are suppressed by the same anti-muscarinic compounds used to
treat patients with DYT1 dystonia, establishing model therapeutic validity and suggesting shared
pathophysiology with human dystonia. Surviving striatal ChIs are enlarged and hyperexcitable, and receive
aberrant synaptic inputs. Selective ablation of these surviving ChI suppresses abnormal twisting, implicating
these cells as key contributors to abnormal movements. Based on these data, we hypothesize that
maladaptations in surviving ChIs drive motor dysfunction.
Successful completion of the proposed studies will fundamentally advance understanding of maladaptive
mechanisms whereby ChI function and connectivity drive abnormal movements, information highly significant
for multiple striatal diseases. We will first address our hypothesis by testing the necessity of striatal ChI
dysfunction in abnormal movement generation by selectively restoring torsinA to these cells (Aim 1), decisively
moving beyond the current association between these factors. We will determine if cholinergic dysfunction arises
primarily from intrinsic ChI abnormalities or defects in how they respond to afferents (Aim 2), and, informed by
Aims 1 and 2, will pursue translational studies (Aim 3) testing whether directly modulating the activity of surviving
ChIs can suppress dystonic-like movements. This proposal is therefore highly signifiant because it will define a
circuit-based model of motor dysfunction that will inform the design of targeted therapeutics."

The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) is a ubiquitous resource for basic research and clinical
interpretation. The world’s largest genetic variation resource, the gnomAD dataset is used in virtually all clinical
genetic diagnostic pipelines worldwide, and the website has over 20 million page views to date. Here we
outline a proposal that will expand the gnomAD resource to millions of samples across diverse global
populations. Our proposal will scale variant-calling and quality control to match this sample size, integrate
statistical tools and other genomic resources critical to clinical interpretation, and ensure that the data we
aggregate will continue to be shared freely with the biomedical community. To accomplish this we will apply a
highly computationally efficient strategy to call all classes of variation (including SNVs, small indels, and the
mutational spectrum of structural variants) across millions of sequenced samples enriched for under-
represented ancestry groups. We will deploy a cloud-based framework for the efficient storage and automated
quality control of these very large and heterogeneous sequence data sets using the massively parallel Hail
architecture. We will leverage the scale of gnomAD to provide increasingly high-resolution maps of the
depletion of functional variation across regions of the genome (highlighting genome regions where natural
selection constrains DNA change) and provide statistical frameworks for quantitatively assessing whether the
population frequency of a variant is consistent with pathogenicity, linking this information with evidence from
the ClinVar resource. We will continue to share all of this data as rapidly and openly as possible with the
biomedical community, long before publication. We will support and expand functionality in our widely
accessed data browser as well as create scalable and publicly accessible datasets that integrate our variation
data with clinical and functional genomic annotations, accessible through API frameworks to empower novel
applications of the datasets. We will also provide resources and training to improve the use of gnomAD
resources by the clinical genetics and wider biomedical communities."

The collective goal of this collaborative P01 application is to target glycans on the surface of bacterial pathogens
using antibodies as anti-infectious agents. We hypothesize that antibodies targeting bacterial glycans with high
affinity will be effective in combating antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. In the specific projects of this
application, anti-glycan antibodies will be developed against selected surface glycan targets on the most serious
bacterial pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella pneumoniae or Kp), and antibiotic resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng), all of
which are on the “High Priority” or “Critical Priority” list of the World Health Organization (WHO). The goal of this
Core will be to serve the bacteriology needs of the P01 Team. Our initial focus will be to test the developed anti-
glycan antibodies against live Sa pathogen using a series of assays, including antibody binding affinity, antibody
specificity, and opsonophagocytic killing potency. Next, we will assess the impact of the antibodies on promoting
complement mediated killing. In parallel we will test developed anti-glycan antibodies against live Kp and Ng
pathogens and repeat each of the antibody binding and killing assays. Finally, we will test selected anti-Sa
antibodies in a mouse model of skin infection and provide the P01 team with new glycan target leads for

The core in charge of antibody engineering and production will serve projects #4, as well as Cores #1 and #3.
Polyclonal as well as monoclonal antibodies will be produced and distributed. The flow of work will be organized
along the lines of 4 specific tasks. Task 1: Produce and characterize anti-glycan polyclonal and monoclonal
antibodies. Following immunization, we will use two main approaches to produce antibodies: standard fusion to
an immortal partner to produce monoclonal antibodies the “classical” way, and expression of recombinant paired
Heavy (H) and Light (L) chains in CHO cells after single B cell antibody chain sequencing (provided by Project
#3). Polyclonal antibodies when needed in large quantities will be produced by immunizing large number of
animals and regular bleeding. Monoclonal antibodies will be subcloned and isotyped. After purification,
antibodies of interest will be characterized for binding to the target glycan by surface plasmon resonance on a
Biacore T200. Recombinant IgA and IgM will be produced in insect cells.
Task 2: Produce Fab fragments of antibodies for structural studies and others. Crystallization is greatly
facilitated by the removal of the Fc fragment of antibodies and the production of Fab fragments. The production
of these fragments will be accomplished by two routes. The first one is the proteolytic cleavage of the full-length
antibodies with enzymes such as papain, the second one is the transient recombinant expression of paired
truncated H - full length L chains in CHO cells.
Task 3: Modifications of the Fc fragment to modify effector functions. The antibacterial functions of
antibodies are highly dependent on the Fc fragment-associated functions of antibodies. Fc composition
determines not only half-life but also complement binding and activation, as well as binding to some bacterial
protein such as protein A. Both mouse and human Fc fragments will be grafted and/or mutated to modify the
bioactivity of a particular antibody and expressed in a CHO cell recombinant expression system.
Task 4: Quality control, storage, and distribution. This particular aim is essential to the success of a core
within a large collaborative grant. Electronic archiving of all reagents will be centralized on a single computer
and backed up on a separate hard drive as well as on the institutional backup system. For each antibody of
interest, immunogen characterization, date of fusion, isotype, binding constants will be presented in a master
spreadsheet. H and L sequences will be accessible for antibodies re-expressed from single cell sequencing.
DNA and cells will be stored at -80ºC and LN2, respectively. The list of the fully described antibodies will be
available on the Website of the PO1 and updated on a regular basis. Distribution within the group will be
discussed at our monthly meetings. Outside distribution will follow the institutional rules of MTA agreement."

central CPS Program themes: 1) Life course cancer epidemiology, 2) Translational population science, and 3) 
Health care delivery science. The shared goals of the CPS Program are to: 1) conduct population-based 
studies to understand the molecular, behavioral and environmental basis of cancer occurrence and outcomes 
across the life course; 2) establish a scientific basis for policies and practices that improve cancer screening, 
quality of care delivery, and health outcomes across the cancer continuum, from prevention to survivorship; 
and 3) design and test interventions and promote policies that reduce cancer risk and cancer burden in our 
catchment area, nationally and beyond. Peer-reviewed cancer-related research direct cost support currently 
totals $8.7M, with NCI funding representing 32% ($2.8M) and total direct costs summing to $9.6M. Sixteen (16) 
CPS Program Members currently have a total of 17 CCSG-defined R01-equivalent awards. Using the same 
NCI definition of cancer-related direct costs in 2014, peer-reviewed cancer-related research direct costs are 78 
% compared to 2014, but per Member funding is up 6% ($216,234 for 40 Members vs. 204,161 for 57

9% (93) inter-programmatic, and 75% (743) with investigators from other institutions. Based on 926 with impact 
data, 20% (181) were high impact journals (i.e., impact factor >8). Compared to 2014, intra-programmatic 
publications have increased, to 31% from 29%, and high impact has increased, to 20% from 16%. Prior to the 
2018 Program reorganization, our two population science programs had inter-programmatic publication rates 
of 13% and 19%, which matched the range (13-19%) they reported in 2014. The CPS program leaders have 
defined program-level and theme-specific plans for future growth. These include enhanced, trans-disciplinary 
mentorship of junior investigators by senior faculty in multiple disciplines; the development and support of

The Dartmouth-Hitchcock Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) is unique among NCI-designated Cancer 
Centers as the only one in Northern New England (VT, NH, ME), the one located in the smallest town, and as 
one of the few whose catchment area has a population that is almost half rural (48%), does not contain a major 
urban core, and has nine of 24 counties classified as 7, 8, or 9 (isolated rural) according to the Rural Urban 
Continuum Codes (RUCCs). While the population within our catchment area is not as racially/ethnically 
heterogeneous as some, social determinants in our largely rural communities – particularly age, income, and 
education play an important role in cancer-related health behaviors, risk, early detection, treatment, and 
survivorship. Disparities along the cancer control continuum between our rural and non-rural populations have 
been documented, spurring distinct research and intervention needs. Our catchment area carries a 
disproportionate burden in cancer incidence, leading to both cancer-related mortality, and a growing population 
of cancer survivors. NCCC plays a unique and substantive role in our communities—engaging the populations 
within our catchment area and focusing research on locally-relevant issues to translate evidence into impactful 
benefits for individuals and communities, with research that is often generalizable to other populations. While 
NCCC has served this overarching mission for decades, the recent formalization of the Community Outreach 
and Engagement (COE) component of the CCSG will catalyze NCCC to identify and address the needs of our 
catchment area in a more comprehensive, cohesive, nimble and timely way as we work in concert with 
NCCC’s Research Programs to accomplish three aims. These are: 1) To identify, measure, and monitor the 
cancer control needs and cancer health equity issues throughout the catchment area through engagement of a 
Community Advisory Board, observational studies and surveillance of health system, state, and national data; 
2) To address the cancer control needs and cancer health equity issues of our catchment area through 
community-engaged interventions, increased participation in clinical trials, and regional collaborations, with an 
emphasis on rural and underserved populations; and 3) To promote cancer research findings from the four 
NCCC scientific programs across the cancer control continuum for translation into sustainable policy, program, 
and health system enhancements. We will apply metrics to track relevance and impact of research related to 
cancer biology, clinical research, cancer-related health equity, prevention, and control within our catchment 
area (surveillance and community metrics) and what are we doing about it (engagement, collaboration, and 
research metrics). The COE initiative will build upon a strong existing base of community and regional 
partnerships. By achieving the COE aims, we will ensure that we are having the most meaningful impact on 
how cancer affects the lives of those in our region, and we will develop a solid infrastructure for sustaining 
those positive impacts and strengthening translation of NCCC research."

NAFLD is closely associated with obesity and type-2 diabetes. Both improved understanding of the disease
pathophysiology and discovery of novel therapeutic targets for NAFLD treatment are urgently needed. Cullin-
RING E3 ligases (CRLs) are a unique sub-class of ubiquitin ligases that are activated upon neddylation of the
cullin scaffold. Mammalian cells contain functionally distinct CRL complexes that recognize specific protein
substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. CRLs are considered promising drug
targets due to their regulation of disease relevant cellular pathways, higher substrate selectivity and lack of
broad cellular impact upon inhibition. Recently, CRLs have emerged as novel regulators of nutrient signaling
and inflammatory response in different organ systems. However, the roles of hepatic CRLs in NAFLD
pathophysiology is still largely unknown. The goals of this project are to delineate the functional impact and
underlying mechanisms by which CRLs regulate hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism and to establish CRLs
as valid therapeutic targets for developing NAFLD and diabetes treatment. This project is developed based on
our key findings that hepatic CRLs are abnormally activated in human NASH livers and murine NAFLD, and
pharmacological inhibition of hepatic CRL activity by targeting cullin neddylation improved insulin sensitivity,
reduced hyperglycemia and liver steatosis by countering the abnormally elevated gluconeogenic and lipogenic
activity that drives NAFLD progression. We will perform mechanistic studies to establish a working model
whereby pharmacological CRL inhibition prevents abnormal liver insulin receptor substrate degradation, the
key underlying cause of hepatic insulin resistance in NAFLD, and attenuates ChREBP-driven de novo
lipogenesis, therefore simultaneously achieves glucose and lipid-lowering effects. Specific aims are designed
to dissect the specific downstream CRL complex that mediates the beneficial effects of cullin neddylation
inhibitors and to identify and functionally validate the CRL substrate receptors that can serve as new
therapeutic targets for future drug development. This study employs new tissue-specific genetic knockout mice,
AAV8-mediated liver-specific gene delivery, and pharmacological treatment models. These models will be
investigated with a combination of molecular and cell biology techniques, metabolic phenotyping,
hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and unbiased transcriptomics and proteomics approaches. By employing
these state-of-the-art models and techniques, our working hypothesis can be rigorously tested and new
mechanistic insights will be obtained."

Cellular communication is essential for the development of all multicellular organisms, and is a key phenomenon
that is disrupted in many human diseases. Cell-surface receptors mediate cellular communication and are the
targets for 50% of FDA-approved drugs, highlighting their disease relevance and druggability. However, many
cell-surface receptors remain understudied and undrugged. The research proposed in this application is focused
on two families of such receptors, adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptors (aGPCRs), and teneurins. The
structures, mechanisms of action and disease relevance of these two receptor families remain largely unknown;
as their large size and complex biochemical nature has made them difficult to study. Recent genetic studies
revealed that aGPCRs and teneurins have essential roles in development of the nervous system, skeletal
system, and heart. These receptors are linked to diseases including cancer, developmental disorders, and brain
malformations, raising an urgent need for mechanistic studies on aGPCRs and teneurins. My research program
aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which these receptors are activated, and to develop new tools
to modulate their activity against relevant diseases. The research proposed in this application involves an
interdisciplinary approach, integrating structural studies of these receptors and their ligands, biochemical and
biophysical assays, protein engineering approaches, and functional assays. This research will build on our
previous successes using this approach, which has yielded many three-dimensional structures of aGPCRs and
teneurins, has revealed crucial mechanistic concepts in the field, and has allowed a better understanding of the
mechanisms of action of these receptors. A major revelation from our work is that the large extracellular regions
of aGPCRs and teneurins are directly involved in regulating receptor function. Despite these advances,
fundamental questions remain unanswered. The ultimate goals of this proposal are to reveal how signal
transduction is mediated within the domains of these large receptors, what exactly activates them under
physiological conditions, how their evolution from early organisms to higher eukaryotes have changed and
diversified their critical functions, and finally how, at the molecular level, we can inhibit or activate these receptors
using synthetic ligands. Our structural studies will be complemented with mutagenesis, signaling assays, the use
of synthetic binders to understand how the different components of these receptors control receptor function,
and physiological analyses performed by collaborators that will test the relevance of the structural and functional
studies. We expect that this research will provide critical insights into the mechanistic details of aGPCR and
teneurin function that will be highly informative for the development of future therapeutics; we will also produce
potent and selective synthetic ligands which can serve as tools for the scientific community to study aGPCRs
and teneurins."

Maternal prenatal stress and nutrition influences fetal growth and long-term child outcomes. Maternal psychological stress
and undernutrition frequently co-occur and affect overlapping biological stress axes involved in fetal growth and
neuroendocrine development. Still, little is known about the interactive effects of maternal prenatal stress and nutrition on
fetal and long-term child outcomes. The proposed K99/R00 research will leverage data from the ongoing “Enhancing
Nutrition and Antenatal Infection Treatment for Maternal and Child Health” (ENAT) trial in rural Ethiopia to examine
interactive effects of maternal prenatal stress and nutrition intervention on fetal and child outcomes. ENAT randomized
2390 pregnant women to receive an “enhanced nutrition” package or “standard care” and collected data on maternal
prenatal stress (Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale) throughout pregnancy. Existing ENAT data will be used to determine
independent and interactive effects of maternal prenatal stress and nutrition intervention on birthweight-for-age (Aim 1,
K99). During the R00 I will conduct a new follow up study with ENAT mother-child dyads at 36 months postpartum to
assess children's stress-sensitive outcomes (Aim 2, R00). Specifically, the developmental follow-up study will assess
child outcomes related to attention, stress reactivity, memory, and socio-emotional functioning. I will also use
biospecimens from ENAT to examine whether maternal and newborn telomere lengths can serve as biomarkers of in-
utero programming of BWAZ and child outcomes in relation to maternal prenatal stress and nutrition (Aim 3, R00). I
hypothesize that maternal prenatal stress and nutrition intervention will have main and interactive effects on newborn and
childhood outcomes. I also hypothesize that maternal and newborn telomere length will serve as biomarkers for prenatal
programing effects of maternal stress and nutrition. My long-term career goal is to lead independent multi-disciplinary
research delineating the complex ways in which biological and psychosocial factors influence fetal and child development
in low resource environments. This award would allow me to acquire basic science knowledge of maternal-fetal nutrition
and telomere biology, technical skills in advanced neurodevelopmental assessments including eye-tracking and
electrocardiography, and practical skills in primary data collection and research management in a low-income country.
During the R00 I will independently lead an innovative child development research study in rural Ethiopia. The proposed
research aligns with NICHD's goal to improve pregnancy outcomes to maximize the lifelong health of women and
children and to help all children thrive. The proposed study will generate epidemiologic and biologic evidence linking
maternal prenatal nutrition and stress with newborn and childhood outcomes that are sensitive to prenatal stress and
predict long-term outcomes related to school achievement and mental health. I intend to use this knowledge to guide
public health decisions regarding pre- and postnatal intervention for the millions of women living in poverty both
domestically and globally and to develop future intervention to support child development in low resource settings."

The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health SA) is one of the nation’s leading
Health Universities and is a chief catalyst for San Antonio’s $42 billion bioscience and health care industry, the
leading sector of the largest minority (Latino)-majority city in the United States. The institution is committed in all
its missions to diversity, inclusive excellence and accessibility. The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences is
one of the five component schools and has 21 graduate programs. The flagship doctoral program is the
Integrated Biomedical Sciences (IBMS) Program that has strategically progressed from 6 departmental
programs, through a transitional umbrella program, and finally to its current state of a truly single, integrated,
multidisciplinary program. It is the IBMS program serves as the pool of underrepresented (UR) students that
have fed two rounds of the current IMSD R25 and will continue to be the feeder for the new IMSD (T32) program.
This proposal builds upon a highly successful intervention program that has resulted in exceptional metrics.
These include UR representation increasing from 17% to 39% in the last decade, and parity with non-UR trainees
in average publications (5) and retention (96%). Time to degree for UR, while shorter than the national average,
remains lagging behind the general IBMS population, likely due to the focus on scientific output. Undergirded by
an asset-based theoretical framework of action that integrates Social Cognitive Career Theory and Community
Cultural Wealth, our strategies in recruitment, research training, faculty development, and career exploration,
will serve to extend our successes and strengthen our contributions to diversity in the biomedical sciences
workforce. Enhanced focus and support related to timely translation of progress into written outputs (fellowship
applications, manuscripts, dissertation etc.) will shorten the time to degree. By the end of this cycle, we are
optimistic we can reach our original goal of graduating a culturally diverse, yet scientifically-uniform, pool of IBMS
(including IMSD UR) students all of whom, by virtue of this diversity, empowering training experience, and
innovative co-curricular activities, are exceptional in their professional skills and attributes and positioned for
career success and leadership in the biomedical sector."

Shoulder pain is extremely common after stroke and occurs in 30-70% of patients. Chronic post stroke
shoulder pain (PSSP) contributes to depression, interferes with motor recovery, and decreases quality of life.
Although PSSP is thought to be caused by damage to the myofascial tissues around the shoulder joint, the
pathophysiology of myofascial dysfunction and pain in PSSP has not been elucidated, leading to missed
opportunities for early diagnosis and variable success with pain management. The accumulation of hyaluronic
acid (HA) in muscle and its fascia can cause myofascial dysfunction. HA is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and a
chief constituent of the extracellular matrix of muscle. In physiologic quantities, it functions as a lubricant and a
viscoelastic shock absorber, enabling force transmission during muscle contraction and stretch. Reduced joint
mobility and spasticity can result in focal accumulation and alteration of HA in muscle, leading to the
development of taut bands, dysfunctional gliding of deep fascia and muscle layers, reduced range of motion
(ROM), and pain. Muscle HA concentrations can be imaged using T1rho (T1ρ) MRI, and myofascial
dysfunction can be assessed using echo texture analysis and shear strain mapping on quantitative ultrasound
(US), which may serve as useful biomarkers to elucidate the pathophysiology of myofascial dysfunction in
PSSP. Hence, in the R61 phase we will: (1) Quantify the extent of GAG/HA accumulation using T1ρ MRI in the
paretic versus non-paretic shoulder rotator muscles, and correlate the T1ρ MRI measurements with US echo
texture measurements to develop a clinic-friendly tool to infer the extent of HA accumulation; and (2)
Distinguish between latent versus active PSSP using US shear strain mapping of the same muscles on the
paretic side compared with the non-paretic side during passive shoulder external rotation (ER), which is
strongly associated with PSSP. To proceed to the R33 phase, we will demonstrate a statistically significant
difference in (1) GAG/HA accumulation using T1ρ MRI, and (2) shear strain mapping for latent and active
PSSP using quantitative US. In the R33 phase, we will use the imaging metrics identified in the R61 phase to
monitor treatment response in a clinical trial of intramuscular (IM) hyaluronidase injections to increase pain-free
passive shoulder ER-ROM. We will administer human recombinant hyaluronidase or normal saline injections in
the dysfunctional shoulder girdle muscles, and measure pain-free shoulder ER-ROM (primary outcome) (1)
pre-injection, (2) 1–2 weeks post-injection (primary endpoint) and (3) 6-8 weeks post-injection. We expect that
local hyaluronidase injections will breakdown the accumulated HA leading to increased pain-free shoulder ER,
and that the improvement will correlate with quantitative MRI and US imaging metrics. At its conclusion, this
proposal will develop quantitative imaging biomarkers of myofascial dysfunction to monitor response to
treatment and aligns with the NIH HEAL Initiative to bolster research to enhance pain management."

Bacteria must sense and respond to rapidly changing and often stressful environments. Their ability to enact
rapid changes in gene expression that alter cell structure and function is key to their survival. In the last twenty
years, it has become abundantly clear that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in bacteria is
pervasive and represents an important stress response strategy. Small RNAs (sRNAs) that base pair with
mRNAs and regulate transcription elongation, translation, and mRNA stability are now known to be common
mediators of bacterial post-transcriptional regulation. Small RNAs (sRNAs) number from tens to hundreds in
bacterial genomes and carry out diverse regulatory mechanisms, yet the molecular details of their activities and
their specific roles in bacterial physiology and virulence remain poorly understood. My research group has been
engaged in research to address these questions for the last 15 years. Our overall approach is to combine
genomic approaches with classical genetics and biochemistry to study sRNAs from the molecular to the
physiological level in Escherichia coli and Salmonella model systems. Our work has defined the target regulons
of several sRNAs, revealing a number of new molecular mechanisms of sRNA-mediated regulation. We have
uncovered factors that promote hierarchical regulation of multi-target sRNA regulons. We have also found stress
response and metabolic phenotypes for sRNA mutants, linking the molecular mechanisms of regulation to
physiological outcomes. In the next funding period, we will build on a strong and productive foundation of
previous work to continue investigating novel mechanisms of sRNA-dependent regulation in E. coli and
Salmonella. We will extend our work to investigate the prevalence of these regulatory mechanisms and identify
new examples. A strong team of collaborators using a diverse set of techniques will allow us to interrogate sRNA
interactions with target mRNAs on a global scale and at the level of single RNA molecules. This will allow us to
generate quantitative models for in vivo regulation by sRNAs and elucidate an extensive sRNA regulatory
network to produce an sRNA interaction map of greater precision than ever before. We envision continuing to
use studies of sRNAs to connect molecular biology to cell physiology to reveal fundamental new insight into the
biology of microbes."

Heart transplantation has become the mainstay lifesaving therapeutic strategy for a growing number of patients
with irreversible, end-stage heart disease. However, numerous challenges must be met to improve long term
heart allograft rejection. Although immune therapeutics (ITs) used to prevent rejection have improved over time,
they are still unable to eliminate acute and chronic rejection effectively. The use of more intense and potent IT
regimens, adopted commonly by transplant programs, can reduce the survival of heart transplant patients by
increasing their chances of developing metabolic syndrome, post-transplant malignancy, and serious infection.
Therefore, a significant unmet need exists to develop novel and innovative strategies to increase the efficacy of
ITs and to reduce their toxicity. Although targeted drug delivery using nanotechnology or antibody-drug
conjugates (ADCs) has sparked great interest in the cancer field, its application to transplantation remains to be
developed. Over the past several years, we have made major strides to introduce a wide range of targeted
therapeutics to the heart transplantation research field. In transplantation, presentation of donor allo-antigens to
recipient T cells in the draining lymph nodes (DLN) is fundamental to the generation of alloreactive T cells that
traffic to the allografts and cause rejection. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that targeted delivery of ITs
to the DLN and allografts not only increases the efficacy of ITs, but it also decreases their toxicity through
reduction of their systemic dosage. In this proposal, we devise a clinically applicable active targeted delivery
method for ITs to LNs and organs to promote allograft acceptance in murine models of heart transplantation. We
also plan to examine the operating mechanisms that result in prolongation of heart allograft survival by our active
targeted delivery platform. These experiments will employ murine heart transplant models, nanoparticle
synthesis, advanced antibody-drug conjugation, comprehensive immune phenotyping assays, and sophisticated
imaging studies to understand the kinetics of T cell trafficking and payloads in the tissue. Supported by our
extensive expertise, as well as established models, techniques, and data, this multidisciplinary collaborative
approach sets forth for the first time a well-balanced, innovative, and clinically applicable targeted delivery
platform. The studies proposed here have the potential to yield results that could be paradigm-shifting in our
approach to immunosuppressive therapy in transplantation."

The Mobley laboratory focuses on developing and using computational tools to dramatically accelerate pharma-
ceutical drug discovery. We focus on the interface between methods and applications, and invest in assessing and
improving computational methods as well as applying methods directly in discovery. We take an open approach
(open science, open source software, open data), making our work a community resource, including our FreeSolv
database of solvation free energies, the Statistical Assessment of Modeling of Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL)
series of blind challenges, our Lead Optimization Mapper (LOMAP) tool for automation of binding calculations,
and the Open Force Field and Open Free Energy projects. Tools and methods we have contributed to are now
broadly used in drug discovery research, including in pharma.
Our overall vision is to make modeling a tool which plays a key role guiding drug discovery research, reducing
costs, time and trial and error. In particular, we want researchers – ranging from medicinal chemists to structural
biologists as well as experts in computation – to routinely input their latest results and ideas into their computer at
the end of the work day, and return to work to ﬁnd prioritized next steps for their research. For example, in the lead
optimization process, one might input the latest assay results as well as ideas for new compounds which could be
screened next, and on returning to work in the morning, ﬁnd ideas ranked by afﬁnity for the target, potential off-
target effects and predicted solubility/oral availability. Results might also include additional synthetically accessible
compounds not originally considered. If predictions were accurate, this pipeline would dramatically accelerate
discovery; thus, we seek to make workﬂows like this a reality via our science and engineering efforts.
In our next ﬁve years, we plan to develop an increasingly automated iterative pipeline for iterative library design,
compound screening, and optimization. With an experimental partner, we use computation to design promising
DNA-encoded compound libraries, computationally analyze screening results, then design models to recommend
additional compound rounds for screening and further iterations of the cycle. When combinatorial screening leads
to promising enough compounds, we shift to compound optimization, employing active learning in combination
with free energy methods and machine learning to prioritize compounds for synthesis and, when possible, for
purchase from compound libraries like Enamine, with assay results guiding additional cycles. Results from this
work feed back into improving our models and guide early stage drug discovery projects.
Our focus involves both pipeline development and actual discovery. While we are developing methods that can be
applied to any therapeutic area or target when coupled with experimental work, we will also focus on antibacterial
discovery, a particular interest for us and our partners in the Paegel lab. Their novel screening and discovery
platform, coupled with our expertise in computational techniques to guide discovery, allow the development of a
powerful new platform for pharmaceutical design, our focus for the next few years."
10805371,"Abstract COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019) continues to be a global health crisis. The efforts of
developing therapeutics for COVID-19 are worldwide and unprecedented. Molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir and
remdesivir are successful examples of such efforts. Mechanistically, nirmatrelvir inhibits the replication of
SARS-CoV-2 by targeting viral main protease (Mpro), whereas molnupiravir and remdesivir target RNA-de-
pendent RNA-polymerase (RdRp). Molnupiravir causes RdRp to introduce widespread errors of the viral
genome, leading to lethal mutagenesis. In contrast, remdesivir causes to pause and induce chain termination.
Nirmatrelvir is a robust substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), and oxidation by CYP3A4 represents
inactivation. In contrast, molnupiravir and remdesivir are prodrugs and require initial hydrolysis for their
antiviral activities. We have shown that remdesivir is hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase-1 (CES1), whereas
molnupiravir by CES2. We have also shown that remdesivir is an irreversible inhibitor of CES2. In addition,
our Preliminary Study has demonstrated that molnupiravir downregulates CYP3A4 expression. COVID-19
symptoms are related to multiple organs, but largely associated with the pulmonary system in terms of severity.
The central hypothesis of this project is that molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir and remdesivir interactively impact their
efficacy depending on a combination and delivery strategy. The Specific Aims are: (1) to ascertain
metabolism-based interactions among molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir and remdesivir, and (2) to develop organ-
targeting delivery via nanoformulation. A large number of human samples will be tested for their metabolism to
ascertain individual variability. Human primary lung and liver cells will be treated with a CES or CYP3A4
inducer or suppressor and tested for altered metabolism of these COVID-19 drugs. These drugs will be
incubated together in cells and their metabolism interactions will be assessed. To develop nanoformulation,
lipid-coated calcium phosphate (LCP) nanoparticles will be synthesized and tested for the incorporation with
and cellular uptake/retention of the parent COVID-19 drugs and their metabolites. Nanoformulated
preparations will be tested for pharmacokinetic and organ-targeted superiority through intratracheal
administration. To connect infectious potential with therapeutic potency, single cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq) will be performed to determine whether cells expressing the receptor for infection are equipped
with proper metabolizing enzymes for these COVID-19 drugs. The scientific premise of the project is strong
and original. The originality stems from the novelty of pharmacological synergy among molnupiravir,
nirmatrelvir and remdesivir depending on a combination and delivery strategy. The project will also establish a
framework that selection of a drug targeting virally infected cells (e.g., viral replication) should be made based
on whether the infected cells express drug-metabolizing enzymes that ensure the efficacy of the selected drug.
In addition, the agents to be studied have a broad spectrum of antiviral activities. Therefore, this project will
have a broad clinical significance not only for COVID-19 but also for future pandemics."

The National Academy of Medicine and the National Institute of Mental Health have described a critical shortage
of child and adolescent psychiatrists (CAPs) who pursue research as a major part of their career. Several efforts
have sought to increase the number of CAP researchers, but the workforce remains insufficient to translate
rapidly emerging genetic, developmental neurobiology, and epidemiology findings into the clinic. We are
determined to improve the yield of researchers for our field by developing an R25-funded research track that is
focused specifically on child and adolescent psychiatry residency. Here, we propose to create the Research
Education in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (RE-CAP) research track within the NewYork-Presbyterian
Hospital / Weill Cornell / Columbia University / New York State Psychiatric Institute CAP residency, the largest
program in the U.S. With our multiple institution partnership, we are able draw from our two top-ten psychiatry
residency programs, in addition to recruiting promising trainees from across the country. Fulfilling the stated goal
of the NIMH R25 mechanism (PAR-20-094) to “develop, maintain, and expand the interest and ability of
psychiatry residents to conduct research…”, we will provide enhanced exposure to clinical and translational
research in the first year of CAP residency in order to develop and expand interest in research. The R25 funding
will permit a select group of residents to extend their second year of clinical training into two years, while receiving
greater than 50% protected time for research. Intensive mentorship from world-class scientists at Columbia
University or Weill Cornell Medical College will provide them substantial momentum to enter a competitive
postdoctoral research fellowship and sustain a trajectory toward a research career."

While researchers continue to study the effects of disproportionate minority contact with law enforcement on
a range of health-related outcomes, a recent review of this work questions the methodological validity of
most studies on this topic. Many of these concerns focus on (a) unrealistic assumptions about police
behavior and (b) poor quality data. This project addresses both by introducing a human development based
model of law enforcement officer (LEO) behavior and applying this model to study how LEOs identify with
male minority youth (MMY) using a novel publicly available data source: broadcast police communications
(BPC). Our long-term goals are (1) to assess the viability of BPC for understanding how LEOs perceive
MMY both “in the moment” via the pre-reflective procedural language used before and during LEO-MMY
encounters and “at rest” via development of a survey instrument measuring LEO identification with minority
youth, and (2) to determine if BPC may be used in lieu of non-public data sources to study police behavior
by developing a novel computational strategy for extracting meaningful information from BPC via, among
other strategies, a first-of-its-kind automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and large scale (>100 hours)
training corpus of transcribed BPC for use by computational social scientists and ASR researchers.
Our previous research revealed that a complex set of psychosocial mechanisms govern the developmental
trajectories of MMYs, indicating MMYs adopt reactive coping strategies to particular stressful events (e.g.
encounters with police) that can be maladaptive (e.g. hypermasculinity) depending on context of
interactions. Our work also suggests that all humans are subject to similar processes. Since the outcomes
of LEO-MMY encounters are ultimately the responsibility of LEOs, this project seeks to improve the quality
of these encounters (i.e. reduce youth trauma) by studying a little acknowledged LEO reactive coping
strategy: the character of procedural language used to provide LEOs with incident-specific information via
BPC. This conceptual approach derives from our theoretical framing (i.e. Spencer’s phenomenological
variant of ecological systems theory, or PVEST) that highlights the development and utilization of reactive
coping strategies in response—particularly—to MMY associated stress. It is our premise that BPC can
prime LEOs to inaccurately interpret the behavior of MMY as threatening, increasing the potential for
adverse events. Such inaccurate assessments are hard to combat since LEOs are acting on the best
information available. As a result, the procedural language of BPC pose unacknowledged risks to the well-
being of MMY. This study will thus perform a first-of-its-kind analysis of BPC to simultaneously assess its
viability for determining racial discrimination in policing and develop a novel survey instrument measuring
LEOs ability to identify with MMY for use by researchers and policing organizations across the country."
