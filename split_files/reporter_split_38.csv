Overall Research Strategy: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) from open-field blast or repetitive mild head impact to
human tau transgenic mice will induce Alzheimer-relevant, tau-dependent pathology, that can be rescued by
suppression of tau expression or tau aggregation inhibitors. Blast-induced tau-related pathological changes will
be analyzed in brains from veterans and mice exposed to blast, and biomarkers for TBI, chronic traumatic en-
cephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer-pathology will be identified in mice and validated in humans. TBI caused by
explosive weaponry is the most prominent type of injury that occurs in military personnel. Over 82% of combat-
related TBIs are classified as mild TBIs (mTBI)—the “signature injury” of recent wars. Service members with
mTBI, often undetectable by conventional brain imaging techniques, do not realize they have sustained this
injury. This “invisible injury” can lead to the development of lifelong disabilities, including neuropsychiatric
and/or neurodegenerative diseases, imposing socioeconomic burdens on patients, families, and society. To-
date, our understanding of the mechanisms by which open-field low-intensity blast (LIB) causes mTBI and sub-
sequent neurological deficits remains inadequate. Thus, there is an urgent need for investigation of LIB-in-
duced pathogenesis using reliable and “real world” animal models. Here, we have assembled a team of investi-
gators with cross-disciplinary expertise and unique blast and in vivo imaging research facilities available at the
Harry S. Truman Veterans Hospital and the affiliated University of Missouri. We have developed a platform us-
ing pressure sensor instrumentations and high-speed cameras to reproduce and record open-field blast expo-
sures with high-explosive velocity C4 detonation. Our preliminary studies show that LIB-exposed mice results
in reduced locomotor/exploratory activity, but with no mortality or other impact/acceleration-mediated bodily
injuries. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we observed mitochondrial damage in cell bodies and
defected myelin in selected brain areas. Further omics and biochemistry analyses indicated mitochondrial dys-
function and increase in phospho-tau protein levels. We propose to test the hypothesis that LIB-induced neu-
ropathology in a human tau transgenic mice is initiated by mitochondrial dysfunction associated with
oxidative stress responses and bioenergetic impairment, which in turn, induces ultrastructural dam-
ages and tau-related pathology leading to metabolic and behavioral deficits. This study will use the trans-
genic mice expressing regulatable human tau (rTg-hTau) exposed either to a single or repetitive blasts in our
well established platform, and investigate effects of mitochondrial dysfunction associated oxidative stress re-
sponses in the mouse brain. Specifically, Aim-1 will evaluate effects of LIB-induced mTBI on ultrastructure in
specific brain areas over time, assess behavioral changes, and determine metabolic profiles by PET/SPECT
scanning using the rTg-hTau mice; Aim-2 will further characterize cell type involvement of ultrastructural
changes and subcellular injuries using TEM combined with immunogold staining technique and immunohisto-
chemistry; and Aim-3 will investigate underlying mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction on mTBI pathogene-
sis and evaluate whether the blast injury is affected by sex difference in rTg-hTau mice following LIB exposure
to gain insights into its relationship with tau pathology. The results of this research will impact our understand-
ing of tau-mediated pathogenesis of mTBI due to combat blast and provide mechanism for its prevention and
treatment."

Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) are three times more likely to die prematurely than the general
population. Sixty percent of this premature death is attributable to inadequate care of chronic, co-morbid
medical conditions. A growing proportion of patients with SMI receive care in accountable care organizations
(ACOs) – health care delivery and finance systems, in which global payments and quality benchmarks are
used to incentivize quality care and lower spending. An increasing number of states are implementing ACO
models in their Medicaid programs, the primary source of health insurance for low-income Americans with SMI.
Medicaid ACOs exist in 12 states, caring for over 6% of the Medicaid population. Medicaid ACOs have the
potential to both improve and worsen access to, and quality of, care for low-income adults with SMI. While
financial structures that incentivize care coordination and programs that address health-related social needs
likely benefit those with SMI, inadequate global payments that fail to account fully for social adversities such as
homelessness could result in lower quality care. Certain features of Medicaid ACOs, e.g. leadership structure
or ACO size, may amplify the benefits or drawbacks of the ACO model for patients with SMI. Evidence from
Medicare ACOs has shown that smaller, provider-led ACOs and those serving a lower proportion of socially-
vulnerable patients perform better in terms of quality. However, no evidence exists on how Medicaid ACO
characteristics affect quality of care or the care experience of SMI adults. Since Medicaid ACOs are rapidly
proliferating, filling this evidence gap is critical and can inform the evolution of the ACO model to better achieve
the goal of mental health parity. In this K23 research plan, we propose to identify features of Medicaid ACOs
(e.g. provider-led vs. hospital-led ACOs) that produce the highest quality ACO care for adults with SMI. We
will undertake this research objective in three critical domains. First, we will study whether certain ACO types
tend to drop patients with SMI, a practice known as favorable risk selection (or “cherry-picking”). This
phenomenon can cause instability of ACO enrollment for patients, itself a marker of lower quality care.
Second, we will compare care access and quality among adults receiving care in different ACO types. Lastly,
we will use mixed methods to examine the care experiences of adults with SMI receiving care in different ACO
types, through in-depth interviews and subsequent integration of qualitative and quantitative findings. For the
first two aims, we will use Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Data and leverage the state’s unique auto-
assignment mechanism as a natural experiment to study favorable risk selection, access, and quality. Auto-
assignment refers to Medicaid randomly assigning individuals to ACOs, allowing us to compare outcomes
across ACO types without selection bias caused by patients self-selecting their ACO affiliation. The goal of my
K23 research is to guide policymakers and hospital administrators in shaping the Medicaid ACO model to
produce more stable, higher-quality ACO care for patients with SMI."

Glaucoma is a chronic degeneration of the retina and optic nerve, and a leading cause of irreversible
blindness, estimated to afflict 80 million people worldwide. It is also the most common neurodegenerative
disease in the world, affecting ~3 million Americans with an estimated $2.9 billion annual burden to the US
Health Care system. Our understanding of the etiology and molecular mechanisms that drive the pathogenesis
of glaucoma remain incomplete. Primary treatment options are limited to lowering intraocular pressure (IOP).
There are no neuroprotective therapies to prevent or rescue the degenerative cascades that define glaucoma.
Astrocytes are a central driver of structural and parainflammatory changes at the optic nerve head (ONH) and
subsequent, irreversible retinal ganglion cells (RGC) death. Emerging evidence indicates that astrocytes have
neuroprotective and pro-survival activities in glaucoma. The nature and relevance of these protective signals
remains unclear. We recently identified a secreted neuroprotective activity in resting retinal astrocytes, which
proved to be a previously unknown resident retinal lipoxin lipid mediator circuit. Lipoxins are a family of potent
specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs), which are being developed as drug targets due to their
established role in dampening and resolving local inflammation in other tissues. We discovered that two
lipoxins, LXA4 and LXB4, are generated by resting astrocytes and in the healthy retina and OHN and that a
lipoxin receptor is selectively expressed in RGCs, which identified a previously unknown direct neural activity
of lipoxins. This intrinsic pathway is dysregulated in response to retinal/ONH stress. More importantly, we
established that therapeutic treatment with lipoxins is neuroprotective by increasing RGC survival and rescuing
RGC function in both an acute neurotoxic retinal injury model, and a chronic IOP dependent model of
glaucoma like neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that the lipoxin circuit is an important paracrine signaling
mechanism to maintain neuronal homeostasis and protect the retina against stress. In a multiple-PI Research
Project, we will characterize this novel neuroprotective network, define its mechanism of action and explore the
efficacy of amplifying the lipoxin circuit as a therapeutic target for neuroprotection with the following three
specific aims: 1) Characterize the mechanism of LXA4 and LXB4 formation in retina, ON, and astrocytes in the
context of health and glaucomatous injury, 2) Define the distinct mechanisms of action for LXA4 and LXB4 pro-
survival signaling in RGCs, and 3) Investigate the therapeutic potential of amplifying lipoxin circuits to prevent
and/or stop RGC degeneration. This goal of this project is to generate transformative insights into a novel
neuronal support mechanism and its dysregulation following injury or stress. Most importantly, we will test if
amplification of this protective circuit can prevent or stop retinal/optic nerve degeneration and vision loss."
10805718,"Cryptococcus neoformans: is an environmental fungal pathogen that causes substantial morbidity and
mortality worldwide, recently named among 4 critically important fungal pathogens on the WHO global priority
list. Veterans are at increased risk of cryptococcosis due to higher-than-average rates of conditions associated
with immune compromise. The CDC estimates nearly 200,000 deaths per year are attributable to C.n. infection
with almost all related to cryptococcal dissemination to the central nervous system CNS, resulting in fatal
cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM). The survivors frequently develop disabilities due to CNS damage.
There is increasing evidence these paradoxical responses to therapy are mediated by patients own immune
response to the fungus, further supported by the beneficial effects of anti-inflammatory therapy. We reported
that CXCR3+,Th1 T-cells represent a pathological cell subset that is dispensable for clearance of CM and
propose that interception of CXCR3-pathway with anti-CXCR3 antibody (Ab) therapy will create a “protective
shield” for neurons and significantly reduce the inflammatory damage in patients with fungal and possibly other
types of CNS infections known to trigger the inflammatory CNS damage. Our preliminary data support highly
beneficial role of anti-CXCR3-Ab therapy in mouse model of CM but these novel findings need to be validated
before anti-CXCR3-Ab can be considered for clinical trials. Our goal is to validate that to demonstrate pre-
clinically that this therapeutic strategy could be a viable option for the treatment/ prevention of inflammatory
CNS injury that occurs during CNS infections. The proposed 2-year project will assess and validate beneficial
effects of anti-CXCR3 antibody therapy in using 3 mouse models of CM that show different scope of fungal
virulence or inflammatory response, alone, and in the settings of standard antifungal therapy used in patients
with CM.
 Aim 1: To validate effects of anti-CXCR3 antibody treatment on the development of CNS symptoms
and inflammatory pathology in models of models of murine CM.
 a) To evaluate benefits of anti-CXCR3 treatment in a highly inflammatory model of mouse CM with strain
52D.
 b) To evaluate effects anti-CXCR3 treatment in a balanced inflammation model of mouse CM with strain
184A
 c) To evaluate effects of anti-CXCR3 treatment in progressive model of mouse CM with strain H99
 Aim 2: To validate effects of anti-CXCR3 antibody treatment in combination with standard of care anti-
cryptococcal drug therapy. The inflammatory brain injury can occur despite the standard treatment with
antifungal drugs in both human patients and in our mouse model. These studies will determine if beneficial
effects of CXCR3-neutralization would be synergized when combined with antifungal therapy using following
approaches:
 a) To evaluate benefits of anti-CXCR3 therapy in CM models with strains 52D, 184A, and H99 in
 combination with the liposomal Amphotericin B.
 b) To evaluate benefits of anti-CXCR3 therapy in CM models with strains 52D, 184A, and H99 in
 combination with fluconazole
 The proposed validation of therapy targeting CXCR3 will intercept a specific pathway of CNS injury directly
involved in the “CNS-damage cascade”. It will create much safer alternative to the long-term treatment with
high doses of corticosteroids, which at this time is the only known intervention in patients developing
inflammatory brain injury in response to CNS infections. This addresses an unmet need for targeted
immunotherapies that could reduce “collateral” immune damage within the infected CNS."
10805719,"Protein kinase CK2 (CK2) regulates several biological features that are hallmarks of cancer. Its
consistent dysregulation in various cancers has led to the suggestion that it is a master regulator
of malignant cells, further highlighted by its potential as a therapy target. This CSR&D research
proposal is designed to investigate the mechanism of function of CK2 in prostate cancer (PCa)
pathobiology; specifically, to define how nuclear elevation of CK2 is involved in transcriptional
mechanisms of castration resistant PCa (CRPC) tumor signaling and relation to progression-free
survival (PFS) in CRPC patients. Our preliminary data demonstrate the association of androgen
axis therapies with elevation of intra- and extra-cellular CK2 levels and PCa progression,
prompting our current focus on roles for CK2 in CRPC transcriptional regulation. Our hypothesis
is that elevation of CK2 levels caused by androgen axis therapies enables treatment resistance
through altered transcriptional programming and CK2-associated nuclear protein complexes.
Further, higher tumor-released CK2 mRNA in PCa patient blood results in worse progression-free
survival.
Two specific aims (Aims 1 and 2) address the basic science mechanism questions in the project
while Aim 3 links the expression of CK2 in CRPC disease to patient outcomes.
Specific Aim 1: determine how elevated CK2 activity alters the AR-related transcriptional program
under androgen axis treatment stress and develop a CK2 gene signature to assess CK2 activity
in clinical datasets.
Specific Aim 2: elucidate CK2-regulated nuclear protein interactions and their contribution to
enhanced CRPC survival under androgen axis treatment stress.
Specific Aim 3: in a prospective study, measure CK2 mRNA serum levels in a CRPC cohort and
correlate baseline CK2 levels with PFS. This aim has two further sub-studies. The first is a
prospective study to compare CK2 mRNA levels in serum of patients pre- and post-prostatectomy.
The second is a retrospective study to correlate CK2 mRNA and protein in metastatic CRPC
biopsies with CK2 mRNA in matching patient serum.
The mechanisms of how elevated nuclear CK2 is involved in PCa have remained unclear thus
far. The present investigations will provide, for the first time, mechanistic data related to CK2-
regulated transcriptional programming and nuclear protein interactions in CRPC disease. These
studies will also provide the first novel proof-of-concept evidence for association of CK2 serum
mRNA with tumor levels and disease progression, providing cross-validation between patient and
model data and the scientific basis for including a drug to block CK2 activity. There is a direct path
to clinical translation of this work by incorporating into PCa treatment a clinical grade inhibitor of
CK2 (CX-4945/Silmitasertib) that is being pursued for phase II clinical trials in other cancers. High
incidence of PCa in the VA and military personnel warrants identification of novel and effective
strategies for therapy; the proposed CSR&D project is of importance as it may lead to improved
precision management of VA PCa patients."

This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on the
development of a validated instrument to measure health status in Down syndrome (DS) to
expand the repertoire of measurements for future research including clinical trials. I am an
Instructor at Harvard Medical School and a clinical geneticist in the Division of Medical Genetics
and Metabolism at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The outlined proposal builds on
my previous research and clinical experience related to health surveillance in DS by integrating
the expertise of my primary mentor, Dr. Jonathan Winickoff, an expert in practice change, a
practicing pediatrician and experienced NIH-funded researcher, and additional mentoring team
members: Dr. Brian Skotko, an international DS expert, Dr. Melissa Constantine, an expert in
creating, designing and validating measurement instruments in the Division of Biostatistics,
Biostatical Design and Analysis Center at the University of Minnesota, and Dr. John Co, a
process improvement expert. The proposed research and training will position me with a unique
set of cross disciplinary skills that will enable me to transition to independence as a physician
scientist to study, measure, and improve the health of individuals with DS.
Although over 200,000 individuals with DS live in the United States, studies to date have
focused on outcomes apart from health. The foundation for this proposal is based on the need
to accurately measure health of all individuals – specifically, with DS – and the dearth of
available tools for this population. Creating such an instrument will provide a barometer of the
current state of health for DS and hold use in future research. In this project, I propose to create
an instrument that directly assesses health in DS – the Down syndrome Health Instrument
(DHI). More specifically, the aims of this proposal are: 1. To conduct focus groups among
caregivers, individuals with DS, panels of experts on DS and primary care physicians, and
cognitive interviews to refine a conceptual model of health for DS and create an item pool, 2. To
administer the DHI and establish internal validity, reliability, and external validity of the DHI for
use in clinical research, and 3. To test the usability of the DHI in two pilot settings: research and
clinical. This instrument will measure patient-reported health in DS for the first time and allow
measurement of health as an outcome which is not currently possible in this population. This
can identify gaps in care, then direct and optimize interventions that will improve care."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a large family of short, non-coding, regulatory RNAs that modulate protein
expression. Abnormal miRNA levels are associated with many diseases, including developmental defects and
various cancers. To generate functional miRNAs, primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) generally need to be first
cleaved by an RNaseIII, Drosha. This critical step of miRNA biogenesis needs to be controlled, in both
accuracy and efficiency, to maintain proper gene regulation. The processing enzyme Drosha requires its
partner protein, DGCR8, for protein stability and substrate specificity. A Drosha molecule binds homo-dimeric
DGCR8 to carry out pri-miRNA processing, but higher-order complexes may also form because clustering of
pri-miRNAs in the genome enhances processing. Our recent groundbreaking cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-
EM) structures provide atomic models of the Microprocessor-pri-miRNA complex in action. Elucidating how the
proteins are organized around the RNA stem-loop also revealed how each distal end (basal or apical) is
independently recognized but also linked to each other via a molecular ruler connecting the detection modules.
The proposed research builds on our previous successes, as the structural framework will enable us to gain
novel fundamental insights into how the macromolecular recognition is accomplished. Our overall goal is to
understand the recognition of pri-miRNAs by Microprocessor at the molecular level. We hypothesize that RNA
structural features and context-dependent sequence preferences dictate the processing fate of each individual
pri-miRNA. We will dissect how the recognition is accomplished at each of the basal and apical junctions of pri-
miRNAs. We will also investigate how diverse RNA sequences and structures from different pri-miRNAs affect
proper recognition at each junction, to reveal the plasticity of the multipart machinery. Our previous work has
also left us poised to address urgent questions on how clustering of pri-miRNAs enhances processing by
Microprocessor, which is crucial for our overall understanding of miRNA biogenesis and has profound
implications for the interpretation of previous and future results in a wide variety of fields obtained by
manipulation of miRNA genes. A better grasp of the core recognition mechanisms will help us explain unique
targets such as clustered pri-miRNAs. Together, the proposed studies will provide a comprehensive
understanding of processing and regulation of miRNAs, important regulators of gene expression. Our work on
deciphering how structure affects RNA recognition is a fundamentally important question and likely be
insightful for many processes involving structured RNAs beyond miRNAs."

Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), colloquially known as long covid, has been reported
in 31%-69% of COVID-19 patients. The prevalence of PASC among patients, even those with
mild infection, and those with prior vaccination, underscores the importance of principled
approaches for uncovering and addressing the cause of these issues. We propose to conduct a
detailed analysis of the immune repertoire dynamics of PASC patients and compare them to
both COVID-19 patients without PASC, and healthy individuals. These will be secondary
analyses, conducted on existing data from a previous study with the Institute of Systems Biology
and Swedish Health Services, which includes longitudinal deep immunophenotyping with single
cell and plasma multiomics, repertoire sequencing, electronic health records, viremia
measurements, and antibody titers for 209 COVID-19 patients. In Aim 1, we will conduct
inference, analysis, and comparison of T-cell receptor repertoire dynamics in PASC. Using
interpretable statistical, biophysical, and machine learning approaches, we will conduct a
detailed analysis of T-cell repertoires aimed at finding PASC specific clonotypes and their
corresponding receptor features. This involves building cohort specific models of thymic
selection, examining how these models differ between cohorts and over time, inferring the
dynamics of repertoire size, sharing and diversity, and uncovering the receptor features which
drive these differences. In Aim 2, we will develop new methods for the integration of T-cell
repertoire and single cell dynamics. The existing breadth of multiomics data allows us to explore
new methodologies for integrating different modalities of longitudinal data. For T-cell repertoires
in particular, we plan to extend existing models of thymic selection to include gene expression of
relevant T-cell specific genes and to study how the expansion and contraction of clonotypes
affects the dynamics of T-cells in gene expression space. By using interpretable biophysical and
machine learning methods, we can construct generative models of TCRs including gene
expression values and study how these distributions change in time. Results have strong
potential to accelerate our understanding of the etiology of immune-based PASC responses,
which is essential for prioritizing potential therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment.
Further, results will advance methods for future research across a wide range of infectious
diseases and immune-mediated medical conditions."

How does decision-making influence memory to leave a long-lasting impact on human behavior? Answering this
question is critical to understanding how impaired decision making might lead to maladaptive memory outcomes,
such as rumination on negative events, susceptibility to false memories, or memory loss. In recent years, the
reinforcement learning (RL) framework has been particularly fruitful for describing impaired decision-making in
psychiatric disorders as well as identifying computational mechanisms linking decision-making and memory. The
overarching aim of this project is to identify the neurocomputational mechanisms that explain how the learning
processes driving decision-making also influence subsequent memory. To do so, the K99 phase of the proposed
study consists of a computational approach to identify how model-free reinforcement learning signals influence
both hippocampal and non-hippocampal recognition memory performance in humans (Aim 1), and a neurobiolog-
ical approach to identify the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying these RL-memory interactions (Aim 2);
the R00 phase of the study will deploy these approaches to study the contributions of model-based reinforcement
learning to these distinct memory processes (Aim 3). Specifically, Aim 1 will test how model-free RL signals such
as prediction errors might interact with the perceptual features of a stimulus to enhance both immediate (non-
hippocampal) memory and delayed (hippocampal) memory in healthy volunteers. Aim 2 will leverage intracranial
recording obtained from humans with epilepsy monitoring electrodes to test how neural activity in the frontal cor-
tex, hippocampus, and non-hippocampal medial temporal regions (such as parahippocampal gyrus) subserve
the influence of model-free RL processes on memory performance. Upon completion of Aims 1-2 (K99), the
candidate—a neuroscientist with a background in the neurobiology of human memory—will obtain new training
in computational modeling of reinforcement learning and decision-making and have a unique, multi-disciplinary
skillset to apply to Aim 3 (R00), to study how model-based RL processes influence mnemonic behavior and neural
activity. The candidate’s mentors are uniquely suited to provide the training for these Aims, given their expertise
in bridging computational modeling (Dr. Xiaosi Gu) and human neurophysiology (Dr. Ignacio Saez) to understand
human decision-making. These skills will also facilitate the candidate’s transition into an independent researcher
with the long-term goal of performing integrative behavioral, computational, and biological studies of how these
human decision-making and memory processes go awry in psychiatric disorders."

The ultimate vision of this research education program is to increase the number of undergraduates who enter
graduate programs in Biostatistics and to maintain a solid underrepresented minority pipeline into biostatistics
graduate programs. We will recruit a diverse group of 20 trainees each year with a focus on minority,
underrepresented, disadvantaged students, and small liberal arts college students who wouldn’t have otherwise
been exposed to the field of biostatistics, for a seven-week research education program.
Recruitment targets rising seniors from colleges and universities without graduate programs or an extensive
undergraduate education in statistics or biostatistics, graduating senior students with no commitment to a
graduate program six months following ISIB, highly promising juniors with a clear vision to pursue graduate
degrees in biostatistics, some graduate students with a desire to pursue a second master’s or a PhD in
Biostatistics, and a few medical students with the goal to pursue a MD/PhD research track in Biostatistics. Special
efforts are made to recruit a diverse student body, including trainees from groups underrepresented in biomedical
research.
The curriculum is a four-component model based on instruction; application; exposure; and research. The
research education program is through case-based instruction of real biomedical study, consisting of classroom
didactic courses; computer laboratory training; invited talk sessions; Zoom sessions; shadowing
sessions; and clinical and translational research enrichment. As initiation to quantitative biomedical research,
trainees undertake biostatistics-faculty-mentored projects on biomedical research. Students select from a
pool of projects according to their interest, and are matched to a faculty mentor. Projects are based on the
analysis of biomedical data, and/or the design of a biomedical experiment, and/or the statistical and
computational issues associated with big data and artificial intelligence. The research teams present their
research findings at the program’s concluding symposium. Trainees interact with biostatisticians in academia,
industry, the pharmaceutical industry; biomedical researchers; biostatistics graduate students; biostatistics
alumni and others. Guidance on how to successfully prepare for a GRE, how to prepare a successful admission
application and how to apply to graduate schools is also provided."

The goal of this proposal is to study and control nephron induction and assembly towards the formation
of replacement renal tissue. Kidney organoids re-create an astonishing cellular diversity comparable to the
early fetal kidney. However, structural connectivity of urine-producing nephrons and their drainage network
formed by ureteric epithelium (UE) is required to avoid rapid pathology, yet has not been achieved. Accordingly,
there is an urgent need to achieve connectivity between nephrons and ureteric epithelium before kidney
organoids can achieve their potential in regenerative medicine. Our long-term goal is to construct ‘higher-order’
synthetic kidney tissues using human autologous stem cell lineages and assembly technologies that mimic the
outcomes of morphogenesis. Our overall objectives at this stage are firstly to gain spatial control over nephron
formation by determining how the mechanical microenvironment contributes to their induction sites and
maturation. Its second objective is to direct nephron fusion with UE at many spatial sites through a controlled
invasive process. Achieving these objectives will mark a transformative advance towards creating replacement
kidney tissue. Our central hypothesis is that mechanical compaction of mesenchymal cells during kidney
morphogenesis permits nephron induction, and subsequently that tight spatiotemporal control over WNT
signaling events is necessary for their efficient fusion with UE. We plan to achieve the objectives through two
specific aims. Firstly, we will determine the mechanical basis of nephrogenesis and use it to specify
nephron positions. We will study mechanical compaction of the nephrogenic mesenchyme, assess biophysical
properties of early nephron cells, and optimize nephrogenesis at specific locations using micropatterning
technology. Secondly, we will program WNT-induced fusion of nephrons with ureteric epithelium. We will
optimize fusion in nephron-ureteric epithelial co-cultures using optogenetic control over WNT signaling, and then
trigger nephron assembly with UE spheroids after transferring them from micropatterned surfaces. The proposed
research is innovative because we create fundamental knowledge while creating tissues that are biomaterial-
free, human-derived (compatible with patient-derived autologous cell strategies), and therefore open to future
development for transplantation. The proposed research is significant because higher-order assembly of human
kidney tissue will create a step-change in renal replacement technology beyond dialysis, transplant, and “abiotic”
filtration. We expect these efforts to have significant positive impact in the areas of fundamental biological
discovery, drug target screening, and regenerative medicine."

Geroscience is a multidisciplinary field that examines the relationship between biological aging and age-related
diseases through multiple processes. These processes are highly integrated with one another such that
targeting them as a group may be an effective approach to developing therapies to prevent or delay age-
related disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related disease and is expected to increase with the
number of elderly individuals rapidly rising in both developed and developing countries. Pharmacological
efforts to find disease-modifying treatments have met with limited success possibly because they have focused
on identifying a specific drug that targets a specific mechanism. AD is a complex disease involving numerous
mechanisms in line with processes of biological aging. Therefore, a geroscience approach to successfully
treating AD is a logical pharmacological concept. A cocktail of three repurpose drugs has been selected for
testing in this proposal based on established anti-aging effects in mice. Phenylbutyrate downregulates the
unfolded protein response and inhibits histone deacetylase thereby upregulating anti-inflammatory molecules.
Rapamycin inhibits mTOR, enhances vascular endothelial cell function and activates autophagy. Acarbose
acts as a caloric restriction mimetic to enhance mitochondrial efficiency and suppress oxidative stress. The
hypothesis is that a drug cocktail of rapamycin, acarbose, and phenylbutyrate, that targets multiple
aging processes associated with Alzheimer's disease will alleviate cognitive dysfunction and
neurological pathology in an aging AD mouse model. Aim 1 will determine if a slowdown in aging will slow
down the development of early stage AD dementia and neurological lesions using the 3-drug cocktail in 20-
month old AAV Aβ42/P301Ltau mice. The contribution of the cocktail will be evaluated in relation to
bioavailability, suppression of systemic disease, alleviation of cognitive impairment and other clinical and
pathological features, and lack of toxicity. Aim 2 will investigate aging processes that can increase the risk for
developing AD, focusing on inflammation, autophagy impairment, insulin/mitochondrial dysfunction and
oxidative stress, epigenetic dysfunction, and vascular impairment. Aim 3 will develop a molecular bridge for
Aims 1 and 2 studies as a unique metabolomics way of showing the relationship between phenotype and
processes of aging. Metabolomic profiles will be developed in brain and liver from Aim 1 cohorts. There will
also be an opportunity to assess effect of gender, age, and strain on metabolomics outcomes. The concept of
a geroscience drug cocktail that could successfully alleviate AD would be expected to have a significant impact
on the health of patients suffering from early symptoms of dementia and other AD related issues."

Malaria in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) of Southeast Asia remains an important public health
problem. Motivated by recent achievements in the reduction of malaria-related morbidity and mortality, six
GMS countries have endorsed a regional malaria elimination plan with the ultimate goal to wholly eliminate
malaria by 2030. However, this ambitious plan encounters a battery of challenges that must be addressed
urgently. In the GMS, malaria shows tremendous heterogeneity in disease distribution, with Myanmar
accounting for nearly half of the region confirmed malaria cases. The recent emergence of artemisinin
resistance in Plasmodium falciparum and deteriorating efficacy of the frontline treatment for Plasmodium vivax
are major concerns for malaria elimination. Furthermore, the emergence of insecticide resistance in major
malaria vectors compromises the effectiveness of the core vector control measures such as insecticide-treated
bed nets and indoor residual spraying. Despite the need for strengthened research to address these problems,
there is a critical shortage in a well-trained workforce in malaria research in Myanmar. Therefore, this training
program will address key knowledge gaps in malaria research, focusing on three scientific areas. Specifically,
we aim to understand the changing malaria epidemiology in this region, to closely monitor the clinical efficacies
of antimalarial drugs and elucidate the underlying resistance mechanisms, and to determine the extent,
distribution, and mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance in major malaria vector mosquitoes. Within this training
program, mentors of diverse scientific disciplines from the University of South Florida and University of
Medicine Magway will join forces to offer multidisciplinary training in innovative approaches that address critical
problems in the current malaria elimination campaign in this region. Based on training needs assessment, we
propose to use a double-track training mechanism: 1) long-term training of three junior faculty members, three
postdoctoral fellows and six PhD students, and 2) short-term training of endemic country scientists through
annual short courses and workshops. The overall training paradigm designed in this application will ensure that
all trainees obtain the required set of technical skills and intellectual expertise to conduct independent research
on malaria. In addition, this training program will serve as an important platform for the transfer of enabling
technologies to endemic-area scientists. By advancing the careers of these trainees, this program aims to build
a critical mass of investigators and a necessary intellectual network in Myanmar to focus on malaria research."

Improving Patient-Centered Communication in Breast Cancer: A RCT of a Shared Decision Engagement System

The diagnosis of breast cancer triggers a cascade of decisions as patients consider multiple treatment
modalities navigated by different specialists. Precise evaluative treatment algorithms have better individualized
treatment recommendations, [yet sifting through the complexity of the test information and treatment options
can be often challenging to patients and can often cause anxiety]. Thus, the advances of precision medicine
cannot be realized without parallel advances in patient-centered communication (PCC). This rapidly evolving
decision context has fueled a pressing need for more patient-centered communication to address the full
breadth of issues—both cognitive and emotional—faced by patients in making breast cancer treatment
decisions. There is a critical need for tools that can engage the patient both emotionally and cognitively and be
integrated into the breast oncology care clinical workflow. This project is a multi-level, factorial study that
crosses a patient-level RCT of 700 newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients within 25 breast surgical oncology
practices to evaluate a shared decision engagement system (ShaDES) to support PCC. The system links an
emotional support-enhanced version of the research group’s previously developed iCanDecide patient-facing
decision tool with a clinic level trial of a Clinician Dashboard to help clinicians address remaining cognitive and
emotional needs in their patients. In collaboration with the Alliance NCORP Research Base and its Statistics
and Data Core, the trial will: 1) evaluate the impact of the emotional support enhancements to iCanDecide on
primary and secondary outcomes measuring patient appraisal of PCC, 2) evaluate the impact of the Clinician
Dashboard on patient appraisal of PCC, 3) examine potential mediators of the patient and clinic interventions,
and 4) conduct a process evaluation of the two intervention components to inform revision and future
widespread implementation of ShaDES. [The results will lay the groundwork for broad implementation of a
shared decision engagement system to improve patient-centered communication in breast cancer.]"
10932326,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Family violence, which includes intimate partner violence (IPV) and child maltreatment, is a significant public
health problem and disproportionately affects low-income and minoritized women and children under one year
of age. Family violence during the perinatal period, the months during and after pregnancy, has been linked to
numerous health disparities intergenerationally, including elevated stress in mothers as well as increased risk of
poor cardiometabolic health and socioemotional development in infants. IPV during pregnancy and its
associations with maternal stress may also place infants at greater risk of child maltreatment and interfere with
mother-infant coregulation of physiology and behavior, in turn negatively affecting infant health and development.
Moreover, individuals differ in how they respond to adverse environments, with extant models suggesting that
maternal and infant resilience factors interact with family violence to confer vulnerability to risk or to promote
resilient outcomes. What remains unknown, however, is an advanced understanding of the stress regulation and
interpersonal mechanisms that link characteristics of prenatal IPV to subsequent child maltreatment and infant
outcomes postpartum. Therefore, in this longitudinal and prospective study, we propose to examine a
mechanistic model highlighting biological, behavioral, and social pathways to understand the role of family
violence in the progression of infant cardiometabolic health and socioemotional development during the perinatal
period. The proposed study will collect self-report, medical record, observational, and biobehavioral data from
330 low-income, racially and ethnically diverse families across 5 time points: 1st (T1), 2nd (T2), and 3rd (T3)
trimesters and 6 (T4) and 12 months (T5) postpartum. Our innovative dyadic approach to studying the
mechanisms linking family violence to infant outcomes during the sensitive period of perinatal development will
address three aims. Aim 1 is to examine how characteristics of prenatal IPV (timing, type, frequency, severity,
predictability) relate to maternal perceived and physiologic stress. Aim 2 is to examine the direct and indirect
associations among prenatal IPV, maternal stress, child maltreatment risk, mother-infant biobehavioral
coregulation, and infant health and development. Aim 3 is to examine how mother and infant resilience factors
moderate the impacts of prenatal IPV, maternal stress, child maltreatment risk, and mother-infant biobehavioral
coregulation on infant health and development. Our unifying hypothesis is that characteristics of prenatal IPV
and maternal stress will carry over into the postnatal period to negatively affect mother-infant relations and
regulation but will be differentially associated with infant health and development based on maternal and infant
resilience factors. This multi-method study will provide critical insight into sensitive periods whereby family
violence that occurs prenatally has a lasting impact on infant outcomes. Identifying modifiable mechanisms of
risk and resilience will also greatly inform strategies for prevention and intervention to lessen the
intergenerational transmission of stress dysregulation, thus improving the lives of vulnerable mothers and infants."

disease  worsening  or  prediction  of  visual  field  (VF)  progression  in  eyes  with  advanced  disease.  Eyes  with 
advanced  glaucoma  are  at  high  risk  of  losing  the  remaining  vision  and  blindness.  Retinal  nerve  fiber  layer 
(RNFL)  and  optic  nerve  head  measures  reach  their  measurement  floor  as  glaucoma  progresses  beyond  the

The higher burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in rural areas, particularly in Appalachia and the
Mississippi Delta is alarming, yet virtually nothing is known about the underlying factors contributing to this
rural health penalty. Prior research has shown that neighborhood environments are important drivers of CVD
risk and racial/ethnic disparities in CVD; however, this work has been conducted almost exclusively in urban
cohorts, leaving ~20% of the population understudied in regard to the #1 cause of mortality in the US. It
remains unknown whether traditional features of neighborhood environments (e.g., food access, crime, social
cohesion) operate similarly in rural areas to impact CVD risk, and this must be investigated rigorously. There is
also an urgent need to better understand the role of more unique features of rural communities, such as geo-
spatial isolation of residences, distance between businesses and retail outlets, and social networks operating
in these contexts. It is important to characterize these unique rural neighborhood typologies and to investigate
which subgroups may be most vulnerable to the cardiovascular health impacts of different neighborhood
archetypes. We will examine whether associations are more deleterious among those who are psychosocially
vulnerable – those with high levels of childhood trauma or inadequate social support. Finally, factors that
contribute to cardiovascular resilience have also been understudied and we have a unique opportunity to
investigate the multi-level factors that may contribute to CVD resilience (optimism, purpose in life, resilient
coping). Thus, the overarching goal of the proposed study is to: 1) examine the relationship between
neighborhood factors and unique neighborhood typologies on cardiovascular health (CVH) in rural
communities, 2) determine which groups are most psychosocially vulnerable, and 3) determine whether the
impact of adverse neighborhood typologies on CVH and subclinical CVD is mitigated by psychological
resilience. The final, exploratory goal of this study is to 4) assess if associations are modified by age, sex, or
race/ethnicity. To achieve these goals, we will leverage existing data from the Risk Underlying Rural Areas
Longitudinal Study (RURAL) that will recruit 4,600 individuals ages 25-64 from 10 rural counties in Appalachia
and the Mississippi Delta of the United States. We will augment this rich rural cohort by linking new data
sources (e.g., geo-spatially referenced databases) and creating new measures in order to provide a
comprehensive database of indicators of neighborhood physical and social environments. All in all, this work
may help provide a more nuanced understanding of the multi- level determinants of both CVD risk and
resilience and may help to identify novel levers of intervention to improve cardiovascular health in rural
communities."
10812514,"Project Summary
Therapeutic expansion or activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) has a potential to be an effective treatment
for obesity. BAT, as well as the closely-related beige fat, are characterized by their abundance of mitochondria,
which are involved in thermogenesis through uncoupled respiration. In addition to the importance of
mitochondrial functions, mitochondrial morphology plays a critical role in thermogenesis. Mitochondria are highly
dynamic organelles that continuously undergo cycles of fission and fusion. Adrenergic stimulation-induced
mitochondrial fission in BAT promotes uncoupled respiration and thermogenesis. Like mitochondria,
peroxisomes are enriched in BAT. Our recently published studies indicate that peroxisomes play a critical role
in thermogenesis through their ability to regulate cold-induced mitochondrial fission. The defect in mitochondrial
fission and thermogenesis in mice with adipose-specific knockout of the critical peroxisomal biogenesis factor
Pex16 (Pex16-AKO) could be rescued by dietary supplementation of peroxisome-derived lipids called
plasmalogens. This project seeks to understand the molecular mechanism of peroxisomal regulation of
mitochondrial dynamics and thermogenesis. Our preliminary data suggest that norepinephrine stimulation, which
activates mitochondrial fission, promotes recruitment of peroxisomes to mitochondria. To understand the role of
peroxisomes in mitochondrial dynamics, we performed protein mass spectrometry on mitochondria isolated from
BAT of Pex16-AKO and control mice. TMEM135, a peroxisomal and mitochondrial membrane protein, was
identified as the most dramatically decreased protein in the knockout BAT mitochondria, with no change of its
levels in whole tissue lysates, suggesting that the protein is mistargeted in the absence of peroxisomes.
TMEM135 expression in BAT increases with cold exposure. Its knockdown in brown adipocytes results in tubular
mitochondria, while the overexpression promotes mitochondrial fragmentation. We hypothesize that peroxisome-
mitochondria membrane contacts regulate mitochondrial localization of TMEM135 in a plasmalogen-dependent
manner and that TMEM135 mediates mitochondrial fission to promote thermogenesis. We propose three specific
aims to test this hypothesis. The first aim will define the role of TMEM135 in mitochondrial dynamics and function
in brown adipocytes. The second aim will determine if TMEM135 overexpression in mice promotes energy
expenditure through increased BAT mitochondrial fission and if it rescues thermogenesis in Pex16-AKO mice.
The last aim focuses on understanding the role of TMEM135 in mitochondrial dynamics, thermogenesis,
adiposity, and metabolic homeostasis using mice with adipose-specific knockout of TMEM135. Overall, this
project has the potential to identify a novel organelle interaction regulating mitochondrial division, characterized
by recruitment of peroxisomes to mitochondria, perhaps leading to new potential targets for therapeutic activation
of BAT."

The pain of loss figures prominently for millions of Americans, and while the emotional toll of bereavement is
well-recognized, resulting disruptions to social connection often go unnoticed and unaddressed. The proposed
study examines ruptures to social connection following what is widely acknowledged as the most devastating
form of loss: the death of a child. Bereaved parents face increased risk for numerous adverse health outcomes
including cardiovascular disease, dementia, and early mortality. One likely contributor to these outcomes is
social isolation. For many parents, their child’s death precipitates long-term estrangements. Friends and family
often do not know what to say or do and may avoid contact. Drained by the need to constantly “put on a brave
face,” parents may self-isolate, and even close relationships may deteriorate or collapse. Social isolation itself
is a well-established risk factor for physical and mental illness, and its adverse outcomes mirror those of
parental grief. Healthcare systems are in a unique position to address bereavement-induced social isolation
due to their many touchpoints with families. That said, direct clinical care for every bereaved parent is neither
possible due to finite resources, nor called for depending on individuals’ risk levels and preferences. Both the
public health model and the transitional model of bereavement care call for the majority of bereaved individuals
to be supported over the long term by their surrounding communities. However, bereaved parents often face
breakdowns in social relationships at the very time that they need these informal supports most. It is therefore
critical that healthcare systems have interventions and resources to help bereaved parents build and maintain
community-based social support. As a basis for these interventions, research identifying specific intervention
targets is sorely needed. While qualitative studies have described the numerous social challenges faced by
bereaved parents, existing research stops short of quantifying changes in specific social network
characteristics and their impacts on perceived isolation (i.e., loneliness), or offering adaptive strategies to help
maintain social connection. The proposed mixed methods study seeks to fill this gap by 1) quantifying changes
in social network characteristics (negative interactions, social integration, emotional support, shared sense of
purpose, network size, network composition); 2) determining associations among network characteristics,
perceived isolation, and health; and 3) identifying adaptive strategies that help maintain social connections. We
will conduct a quantitative survey of approximately 300 bereaved parents assessing network characteristics,
perceived isolation, and health, and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with a subset of ~45 parents to
identify strategies that help maintain social connection. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a
multimodal intervention that can be implemented by healthcare systems to help mitigate bereavement-induced
social isolation. The proposed study has the potential to reduce isolation and adverse health outcomes among
the millions of bereaved parents in the U.S., and potentially can be expanded to other bereaved populations."
10812047,"To enable sustained remission of HIV recurrence in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART), we aim to
develop a strategy to provide people with HIV (PWH) with robust and sustained anti-HIV T cell and antibody
responses. We will develop injectable cell-specific lentiviral vector (LV) technology to direct in vivo generation of
T cells expressing anti-HIV chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and/or broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) genes.
We hypothesize that by establishing broad and sustained anti-HIV immune surveillance in vivo, reactivated
latently infected cells will be rapidly eliminated before they can initiate disseminated infection together with cells
newly infected by HIV produced by distal reservoirs. We developed and validated the safety and efficacy of a
highly potent and broad anti-HIV duoCAR-T cell therapy that is demonstrably superior to monoCAR-T cell
therapy. These duoCAR-T cells target two highly conserved independent gp120 epitopes, enabling highly
effective inhibition of HIV infection, while also being extremely resistant to HIV infection and providing sufficient
broad reactivity to inhibit the emergence of immune escape epitopes. Our preclinical studies demonstrating the
safety and efficacy of duoCAR-T cells and their great promise to provide PWH with sustained remission after
cessation of ART enabled FDA-approval, which has advanced them into clinical trials in PWH (NCT04648046).
We have also developed LV capable of engineering T cells to produce therapeutic levels of bNAb in vivo.
However, generating duoCAR-T cells or T cells secreting bNAbs using standard ex vivo LV transduction and
reinfusion into patients requires complex logistics which greatly limits wider use, particularly in resource-poor
settings with the highest incidence of HIV infection. This proposal is highly significant and very responsive to the
RFA, specifically our focus on developing and evaluating innovative approaches to engineer lentiviral vectors
(LV) to deliver in vivo T-cell targeted gene therapy to confer T cells with potent cellular and humoral anti-HIV
activity. We propose several innovative strategies to achieve our goal which include: (1) development and
optimization of novel CD3-targeted LVPs directing selective in vivo transduction of T cells to produce optimized
anti-HIV duoCAR-T cells; (2) identification of the CD3- or peptide-MHC conjugate-targeted LV most capable of
generating optimized anti-HIV duoCAR-T cells that potently suppress HIV infection in vitro and in vivo; and (3)
development and optimization of CD3-targeted LV to selectively transduce T cells in vivo to enable them to
produce bNAb. We hypothesize that administration of T cell-specific therapeutic LV will direct selective in vivo
generation of duoCAR-T cells and bNAb-producing T cells capable of exerting potent and sustained anti-HIV
immune surveillance, either alone or together, to provide PWH with ART-free remission. We will also examine
whether novel gp120-exosomes and multifunctional cytokine complexes consisting of IL-15 and a TGFβ inhibitor
or IL-7, IL-15 and IL-21 stimulate in vivo expansion of duoCAR-T cells to further augment their anti-HIV activity."
10812048,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal of all brain malignancies and many patients die within one year of
diagnosis. These poor outcomes are driven by GBM's aggressive growth, local invasion, and both de novo and
rapid development of radiotherapy and chemotherapy resistance. GBM uses alternative splicing to generate
unique mRNAs and proteins that promote its proliferation and invasion. Here, we investigate specific alternative
splicing programs and will test if their manipulation has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic strategies to
oppose the aggressive biology of this deadly disease. Estrogen-related receptor beta (ESRRB) is an orphan
nuclear receptor - it is not bound by estrogen. Upregulated expression and increased ESRRB gene copy number
are both associated with longer overall GBM survival. The beta2 isoform of ESRRB is produced by alternative
splicing, with current evidence implicating serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 6 (SRSF6) as a key driver of this
event. Beta2 activation by the synthetic ESRRB agonist DY131 induces apoptosis in GBM cells. Beta2 localizes
to the cytoplasm and interacts with cortactin, an actin binding protein that increases cell motility by controlling
actin remodeling and vesicle trafficking. Importantly, the synthetic ESRRB agonist stabilizes beta2/cortactin
interaction, leading to loss of GBM cell motility, effects we propose are linked to the antitumor effect of beta2. In
this proposal, we hypothesize that the beta2 isoform of ESRRB acts as a potent inhibitor of GBM by interacting
with cortactin to inhibit motility/invasion. We further propose that pharmacological upregulation/activation of
beta2 may ultimately offer a novel approach to GBM therapy. In Specific Aim 1, we will test if SRSF6 promotes
ESRRB splicing to increase beta2 expression levels, and if direct upregulation of beta2 by SRSF6 inhibits GBM
motility/invasion. We will complement these focused, mechanistic studies by testing two novel splicing
modulatory drugs for their ability to increase beta2 production in GBM. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify how
the beta2/cortactin interaction inhibits GBM motility. Specifically, we will test if beta2 suppresses GBM motility
by inhibiting cortactin-mediated actin branching and remodeling, and vesicular trafficking in GBM. In parallel, we
will perform an unbiased screen to identify other novel cytoplasmic binding partners of beta2, and test their role
in suppressing GBM motility. While this grant is focused on foundational mechanistic studies, they will provide
powerful preclinical evidence for a future novel therapeutic strategy for GBM. The long-term impact of
successfully establishing a new treatment regimen that upregulates and activates beta2 would be a major benefit
to the field, in which 1) the current first-line standard of care (surgery, concurrent temozolomide + radiotherapy,
adjuvant temozolomide) has remained essentially unchanged for nearly 20 years, and 2) there is no widely
accepted second-line standard of care."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a leading cause of death in the United States, with disparities in morbidity and
mortality widening through the COVID-19 pandemic by race, ethnicity, sex and gender. Medications for OUD
are life-saving, and increasing access, utilization and retention in evidence-based medication treatments for
OUD is the most effective pathway forward to combat this public health crisis. Comorbid conditions common
among people with OUD, such as insomnia, hinder OUD treatment retention and benefit, rendering patients at
persistent overdose risk. Insomnia is prevalent in over half of patients receiving medication treatment for OUD,
representing an ideal target for adjunctive treatments to medications for OUD aimed to improve health and re-
covery outcomes. Cognitive Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (CBT-I) is considered the gold-standard treat-
ment for insomnia, yet its evidence is limited in OUD populations. Historically, behavioral therapies integrated
into OUD treatment have demonstrated improved effectiveness when they are tailored to the specific biopsy-
chosocial needs of this unique patient population. The objectives of this R34 application are to develop, refine,
and preliminarily test the effects of a novel, integrated approach to treating insomnia in adults with comorbid
opioid use disorder and insomnia. Utilizing a multiple prong approach through a health equity lens, we will de-
velop, pilot test, and refine a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia and Opioid use disorder (CBT-IO).
The proposed study will tailor CBT-I to OUD patient-reported biopsychosocial needs gained from preliminary
qualitative data gathered from patients with insomnia and OUD receiving buprenorphine. We will adapt the
CBT-I content (OUD specific information, such as anchoring sleep schedules to buprenorphine administration)
and its delivery (utilizing telehealth vs. in person options for sessions based on barriers to access). We will take
a multi-disciplinary approach to the intervention’s development and testing, incorporating a community-based
expert panel review, and patient pre-testing using both qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate the in-
tervention’s feasibility, acceptability, and engagement. We will then examine the preliminary effects of the
newly developed and refined intervention in a small, yet diverse, sample (N=56) of adults with comorbid insom-
nia and OUD. Outcomes of interest include both sleep and substance use outcomes. Specific Aims include:
AIM 1: Develop and refine a CBT-I intervention (CBT-IO) for individuals with OUD, which includes adapted
content and a social determinants of health (SDoH) informed decision aid to guide individualizing treatment
delivery route (telehealth vs. in person); AIM 2: Evaluate preliminary efficacy of CBT-IO to improve insomnia
and OUD outcomes for individuals receiving medication treatment for their OUD. In line with NIDA’s call to ad-
vance personalized medicine in addictions, this work develops and evaluates a novel treatment tailored for in-
dividuals with OUD while also incorporating a health equity approach. Results will inform large scale studies to
determine best methods for treating insomnia and OUD in at-risk samples of treatment seeking adults."

Young (aged 18-29) Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) in Atlanta experience high rates of HIV
acquisition (8.9%/year) and STI infection (30%/year). Over the past 5 years, we have followed a cohort of 300
YBMSM in Atlanta and have offered PrEP as part of a comprehensive package of prevention interventions.
We have had substantial uptake of PrEP – over 40% of YBMSM initiated PrEP – but we have also observed
high rates of PrEP discontinuation (39% of all PrEP starts) and ongoing high rates of new STI diagnoses.
Even with 44% PrEP uptake in the cohort, HIV incidence remained high at 6.2%/year. This represents a 30%
reduction in HIV incidence compared to our pre-PrEP comparison cohort, but is still unacceptably high.
Therefore, we proposed to continue our cohort approach but to add three new interventions: (1) an innovative
“early warning” system to identify YBMSM on PrEP who are at risk for discontinuing PrEP, and providing a
motivational interviewing-based peer intervention; (2) offering on-demand PrEP to men who decline daily PrEP
or who plan to stop daily PrEP because they are unwilling to take a daily pill or perceive their risks to be
infrequent; and (3) offering STI PEP with doxycycline for all men, regardless of PrEP use, to avert new STIs.
This is an implementation-focused, single arm cohort approach, using a target trial design to emulate a
randomized trial and evaluation of process measures. Primary outcomes are rates of PrEP discontinuation
and rates of new STI diagnoses."

Obesity, a preventable and treatable condition, is associated with the leading causes of death in the United
States and worldwide. Women who identify as sexual minorities (SMW; i.e., women with sexual orientations
other than heterosexual) are up to twice as likely to have obesity compared to men and heterosexual women,
yet little is known about the mechanisms that confer heightened risk for these communities. The minority stress
model, which posits that historically marginalized populations, such as SMW, are at increased risk for stress due
to increased exposure to stigma and discrimination at the structural, interpersonal, and individual levels, can be
applied to help delineate potential factors that place SMW at greater risk for overweight and obesity. However,
limitations in the literature hinder our ability to address obesity disparities. First, SMW are often treated as a
homogeneous group, so we know little about risk factors for understudied subgroups of SMW (e.g., bisexual,
asexual, queer, pansexual, questioning). Second, among the limited research on obesity or the primary
behavioral drivers of overweight and obesity (i.e., energy-balance behaviors such as diet, physical activity, and
sedentary activity) among SMW, there is an overreliance on cross-sectional, retrospective self-report, or semi-
annual longitudinal designs. While these studies provide a foundation for understanding behavioral risk factors
among SMW, these methods are limited in the data they can provide. Experience sampling methods (ESM) can
advance our understanding by identifying temporally proximal risk factors for obesity (e.g., factors predicting
physical activity or high caloric intake) and disentangling risk factors from correlates. I will conduct a mixed
methods study to delineate factors and mechanisms that may be associated with obesity risk among SMW,
which is highly aligned with NIMHD’s focus on research that seeks mechanisms and pathways behind health
determinants that confer worse outcomes in health disparity populations. First, I will utilize a qualitative life history
approach to identify preliminary factors associated with the development and maintenance of weight-related
cognitions and behaviors (Aim 1). Second, I will use ESM to test the preliminary model identified in Aim 1 and
examine relationships between minority stressors and weight-related behaviors in real time in the natural
environment among SMW from diverse sexual orientation identities (Aim 2). These aims support my training
plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: multi-level influences on SMW obesity outcomes
(Training Aim 1); qualitative data collection and analysis (Training Aim 2); ESM and advanced statistics for
ESM data (Training Aim 3); and career development (Training Aim 4). Results will be used to inform a model
of minority stress and obesity among SMW, which I will then test in a rigorous, large-scale, longitudinal trial
(R01). This K01 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in promoting SMW behavioral health."

Oral cancer patients suffer from pain with impaired oral function. Oral cancer pain is initiated and maintained in
the periphery and worsens during cancer progression. Perineural invasion (PNI), defined as cancer invading in,
around, or along the nerve, correlates with increased pain severity and poor prognosis. Treatment options for
pain are limited. No targeted treatments for PNI exist. Current research on oral cancer pain mainly focuses on
the effect of cancer mediators on primary afferent neurons. Neuropathic pain caused by PNI is rarely
addressed mechanistically. The role of Schwann cells (SCs), the most prevalent cell type supporting peripheral
nerves, has not been defined in oral cancer PNI and pain. We found that oral cancer induces SC activation, a
well-known response of SCs to nerve injury. Oral cancer cells and SCs mutually promote proliferation,
migration, and invasion. Supernatant from oral cancer-activated SCs induces nociceptive behaviors in mice.
We found that oral cancer cells are enriched with the soluble form of tumor necrosis factor (sTNF), a master
regular of cytokines. sTNF is known to activate SCs and mediates neuropathic pain. The primary receptor for
sTNF is TNFR1. We hypothesize that sTNF activates SCs through TNFR1 to promote oral cancer PNI and
neuropathic pain. Our hypothesis is based on our observations in patients, cell culture and animal models of
oral cancer and PNI. This proposal will combine expertise from oncology, pathology, electrophysiology, cell
biology, nerve ultrastructure, animal behavior, and statistics to: Aim 1. Evaluate associations between SC
activation, SC TNFR1 expression, PNI, and pain in human oral cancer. Aim 2. Characterize the effect of sTNF
neutralization or SC TNFR1 gene deletion on oral cancer pain. We will determine whether sTNF-TNFR1
mediates SC activation, which causes SCs to release nociceptive mediators, and/or is accompanied by
myelin/axon abnormalities, resulting in nociceptor hypersensitivity and neuropathic pain. Aim 3. Characterize
the effect of sTNF neutralization or SC TNFR1 gene deletion on oral cancer PNI. We will test whether sTNF-
TNFR1 mediated SC activation facilitates proliferation, migration, and invasiveness between SCs and oral
cancer cells, promoting PNI. Our objective is to elucidate the mechanism of SC activation and to test the
therapeutic potential of controlling SC activation to reduce oral cancer PNI and pain. Understanding how SCs
contribute to oral cancer PNI and neuropathic pain may reveal new opportunities and strategies to interrupt
these co-morbidities of oral cancer."

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a spinal deformity of unknown etiology, resulting in rotation and
abnormal curvature. Associated physical signs include uneven shoulders and waist, rib and flank protrusions,
as well as hip misalignment. Scoliosis also affects psychological wellbeing, and can cause cardio-respiratory
issues, pain, discomfort and disability in older ages. AIS is a relatively common pediatric musculoskeletal
condition, affecting 0.5%–5.2% of adolescents. Females are disproportionally affected, with a female-to-male
ratio of 10:1 in curves larger than 50°. Scoliosis progression can accelerate rapidly over a short period of time,
particularly during growth spurts. The most common treatment for AIS is observation (“watchful waiting”) for
children with curves between 10°–25°, bracing for curves 25°–45°, and surgery typically recommended for
growing children with curves >45°. Every year in the USA there are ~29,000 scoliosis surgeries, each costing
~$92,000 USD. Surgery is irreversible and comes with risk of blood loss, infection, neurological compromise,
or pseudarthrosis that requires reoperation. Recent studies demonstrate great promise for specialized
physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercise (PSSE), such as “Schroth” therapy, for decelerating or preventing
progression, and improving outcomes. There is a crucial need for expanding the related evidence base,
through a rigorous and adequately powered multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT). The proposed
project will lead to development of such a trial, with preparation and submission of a corresponding U01
application to fund the RCT conduct. Our overarching hypothesis is that scoliosis-specific physical therapy in
skeletally immature children with mild and moderate scoliosis (curves <45°) will reduce risk of scoliosis
progression, improve patient reported outcomes, and in long-term follow-up will reduce the risk of requiring
surgery. To develop our plan, we propose two aims: (1) Design a rigorous clinical trial protocol for evaluation of
a scoliosis-specific physical therapy intervention in AIS; (2) Complete several milestones as the basis for
preparation of a successful U01 application, including development of a manual of operating procedures,
design and testing of case report forms and electronic data capture systems, selection of study sites and
investigators, development and testing of recruitment procedures, IRB and regulatory document preparation,
and development of a Data Safety Monitoring Plan. This will lay the groundwork for a landmark trial for non-
operative management of AIS, with potential to impact standard of care for the most common pediatric spinal
disorder."
10932998,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most aggressive types of
hematopoietic malignancies with various genetic alterations. Ten-Eleven Translocation 2 (TET2), an enzyme
involved in DNA demethylation, is deleted or mutated in 15-20% of AML patients. Those patients with TET2
deficiency are poorly responsive to currently available therapeutic regimens, leading to more adverse outcomes
than patients with other AML subtypes. Thus, it is urgent to identify new therapeutic target(s) and develop novel
effective approaches to treat TET2-deficient AMLs. Tet2 loss in mice facilitates the self-renewal of hematopoietic
stem cells (HSCs) and leukemic stem/initiating cells (LSCs/LICs). The LSCs/LICs reside in a specialized
microenvironment called “niche” in the bone marrow (BM) to support their survival and self-renewal. There are
several critical gaps in our current knowledge of the molecular mechanism underlying LSC/LIC homing
and of the role of TET2 deficiency in the BM microenvironment. Meanwhile, evidence is emerging to support
a novel function for TET2-mediated oxidation of methyl-5-cytosine (m5C) in RNAs, including messenger RNA
(mRNA). However, it is unknown whether and (if so) how TET2-mediated RNA m5C demethylation contributes
to leukemogenesis. Our preliminary study showed that Tet2 deficiency stimulates the Tetraspanin 13
(Tspan13)/C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (Cxcr4) axis to facilitate AML homing/migration into the BM
microenvironment, giving rise to increased LSC/LIC self-renewal and fast leukemogenesis in vivo. Tet2
deficiency-mediated increase of mRNA m5C modification in Tspan13 is recognized by Y-box binding protein 1
(YBX1), which in turn stabilizes Tspan13 transcript and increases its expression, thereby activating the Cxcr4
signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR4 suppresses LSC/LIC homing into the BM microenvironment and
shows a synergistic effect with hypomethylating agents in killing TET2-deficient AMLs. These results lead to our
central hypothesis that TET2-mediated mRNA m5C demethylation is involved in reprogramming BM
microenvironment. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose three Specific Aims to test our hypothesis: (1)
Determine the definitive role of TET2 in the homing of LSCs/LICs into BM microenvironment; (2) Characterize
the mRNA m5C-dependent and functionally essential targets of TET2 and decipher the molecular mechanisms
underlying the role of TET2 in LSC/LIC homing and self-renewal; and (3) Assess the therapeutic potential of
targeting the TET2/CXCR4 axis in high-risk TET2-deficient AMLs. Overall, our proposed studies will substantially
advance our understanding of the fundamental biology of TET2-mediated epitranscriptomic changes in BM
microenvironment and may result in the development of novel effective approaches to treat AMLs with TET2
deficiency. Thus, our project is of high novelty and significance in both basic research and translational medicine."
10801127,"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that can cause severe disease in congenitally infected
infants and in immunosuppressed people. Toxoplasma co-opts host cells by secreting effector proteins, called
ROPs and GRAs, into the host cell. In mice, the cytokine interferon gamma (IFNγ) is essential to control
Toxoplasma by inducing a variety of parasiticidal mechanisms while in humans the cytokine tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)α can compensate for the absence of IFNγ. The IFNγ-induced mechanisms that control
Toxoplasma in rodents are largely absent in humans and most of the parasite’s ROPs and GRAs that
determine virulence in rodents play no role in counteracting the human IFNγ response. Thus, despite
Toxoplasma’s enormous health implications, there is currently a lack of mechanistic knowledge on (i) how
IFNγ- or TNFα-stimulated primary human cells inhibit Toxoplasma growth; and (ii) how Toxoplasma secreted
effectors allow parasite growth in stimulated primary human cells. Our long-term goal is to determine how
Toxoplasma secreted effectors mediate its survival in humans, even in the presence of a fully functioning
immune system, which could help the development of targeted interventions to minimize the adverse health
effects of toxoplasmosis in at-risk individuals. The overall objective for this application is to determine the
mechanisms by which activated primary human cells detect and destroy Toxoplasma and how Toxoplasma
counteracts these mechanisms. Our hypotheses are (i) that mechanisms of Toxoplasma growth inhibition in
stimulated human cells are guanylate-binding protein (GBP1)-mediated breakage of the vacuole followed by
endolysosomal fusion with the parasitophororous vacuole, which is Toxoplasma’s replication niche, and
induction of early parasite egress; and (ii) that the novel Toxoplasma GRA effectors identified from our
genome-wide parasite loss-of-function screen in IFNγ-stimulated human cells determine parasite resistance to
IFNγ by preventing early parasite egress. The hypotheses will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1)
Determine the mechanism by which IFNγ/TNFα-stimulated human cells inhibit Toxoplasma growth; and 2)
Determine the mechanism by which Toxoplasma effectors affect parasite fitness in IFNγ/TNFα-stimulated
human cells. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it is using results from an
unbiased innovative CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screen that identified Toxoplasma genes that determine
resistance to IFNγ-mediated parasite growth inhibition in primary human cells. These results are expected to
have an important positive impact because they will provide a science-based framework for the future
development of novel targets for therapy, e.g., by stimulating host parasite killing mechanism or by inhibiting
parasite virulence determinants. Our results will also aid prediction of Toxoplasma strain virulence in humans
and identification of human toxoplasmosis susceptibility loci."

Given the growing prevalence of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), we
need to know how these disease states affect the function and expression of the hepatocellular uptake
transporters NTCP, OATP1B1, and OCT1. While it is known that these disease states lead to increased amounts
of free cholesterol and palmitoylated proteins in the liver, it remains unclear how these alterations influence the
function and post-translational regulation of clinically significant hepatic membrane proteins, such as NTCP,
OATP1B1, and OCT1. Our long-term goal is to understand how these transporters are expressed and regulated
in human hepatocytes. Our overall objective in this application is to elucidate how changes in membrane
composition due to obesity, with respect to cholesterol and lipids, affect the function and expression of NTCP,
OATP1B1, and OCT1. Our central hypothesis is that increased free cholesterol and the palmitoylation state
modulate the function and expression of NTCP, OATP1B1, and OCT1. The rationale for the proposed research
is that understanding the mechanisms by which transporter activity is regulated by changes in membrane
composition and lipid modifications will explain pathological observations, optimize drug response, and lead to
information that could inform drug safety profiles. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific
aims: 1) Identify the mechanisms by which free cholesterol affects the function and expression of NTCP,
OATP1B1, and OCT1; and 2) Elucidate the modulatory effects of protein palmitoylation on NTCP, OATP1B1,
and OCT1 function and expression. Under the first aim, HEK293 and HepG2-CRISPRa cell lines stably
expressing the transporters, freshly isolated human hepatocytes, and mouse models of NAFLD will be used to
examine to what extent free cholesterol regulates these. For the second aim, the same model systems will be
used along with MS proteomics and site-directed mutagenesis to assess how palmitoylation affects the
transporter's function and expression. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it
represents a substantive departure from the status quo by focusing on how free cholesterol and palmitoylation
affect the hepatic uptake transporters. The proposed research is significant because it will clarify the basic
molecular mechanism(s) of the post-translational regulation of NTCP, OATP1B1, and OCT1 function and
expression and help ultimately explain alterations in bile acid and drug uptake in patients with obesity."

White matter ischemia is a progressive vascular disease that leads to focal neurological deficits, accumulates to
cause dementia, and accelerates the pathology of Alzheimer's Disease. The term white matter ischemia or white
matter hyperintensity, based on imaging, corresponds to several disease pathologies, including progressive
blood brain barrier breakdown, small focal strokes and end-arterial hypoperfusion. White matter ischemia is
strongly age-associated: at age 80 all of us will have white matter hyperintensities on MRI. Despite substantial
pre-clinical study of mechanisms of white matter repair in inflammatory white matter disease (such as multiple
sclerosis), there is little information on how cerebral white matter responds to white matter ischemia, and may
initiate neural repair. This grant utilizes a model of white matter ischemia in the mouse, which produces diffuse
and progressive damage from the small vessels in the subcortical white matter, to determine the mechanisms of
white matter repair. The studies characterize candidate molecular systems that mediate this process and identify
neuronal network function in white matter ischemia and during repair and recovery. The studies will determine
the effects of age on these processes. This grant will use an innovative platform of technologies, including a
newly developed mouse model, transgenic cellular fate-mapping, optogenetic and resting state MRI studies, and
viral gain and loss of function approaches. The outcome of this work will be to identify novel molecular targets
for neural repair in white matter ischemia, develop an understanding of the neuronal network function that leads
to behavioral deficits in this disease, and develop an imaging biomarker for repair and recovery in white matter
ischemia."

Effective utilization of somatic stem cells to repair injured tissues or to bioengineer organs is an important goal
in regenerative medicine. However, clinically-proven application of stem cells in therapies remains limited in
medicine today. The translational hurdles are in large part due to our lack of ability to precisely control stem cell
proliferation and differentiation, which is critical for safe and effective clinical use. To overcome this challenge,
we must first deepen our knowledge of normal stem cell regulation in organs. In addition to biochemical signals,
tissue mechanical forces exerted by cell pulling and pushing can in theory serve as a signaling mechanism to
regulate gene expression and various cellular processes in adult stem cells. However, the modulation and
influence of these force signals within a 3D tissue are dramatically understudied, leaving open questions around
how stem cells sense and interpret forces. We and others have demonstrated the mouse incisor as a powerful
model system to study adult epithelial stem cells and we have previously shown that the transcription co-factor
Yes-associated protein (YAP) and chromatin repression are important for regulating incisor epithelial stem cells.
Our initial studies indicate that both mechanical deformation of cells and the cell geometry associated with dense
packing can influence the expression of YAP and repressive chromatin marks in the incisor stem cell niche. The
mouse incisor thus provides a valuable in vivo platform to study how cellular organizations coordinate mechanical
signals to control stem cell functions via YAP and chromatin. In this application, we propose to test the hypothesis
that dense cell packing modulates the effect of tissue forces on nuclear deformations, which in turn regulate YAP
nuclear entry and H3K27me3-mediated transcriptional repression in the dental epithelial stem cells. To test this:
Aim 1 will characterize the force patterns, magnitude, and nuclear stiffness in wild type incisors, specifically in
the densely packed dental epithelial stem cells and the more loosely packed transit amplifying cells.
Aim 2 will study how changes in the cell geometry and packing affect tissue force patterns, nuclear deformations,
YAP localization, and chromatin states. We will perform mechanical rescue experiments to test the role of forces.
Aim 3 will address the functional role of lamin A in regulating nuclear stiffness and heterochromatin formation in
the dental epithelial stem cells, as well as its scaling response to cell packing.
Together, these studies will deliver a mechanistic understanding of how tissue forces control dental stem cells
and yield findings that will be of general interest to both dental researchers and to the stem cell and regenerative
medicine communities."
10806132,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Sugars, in particular glucose, are bioenergetic molecules involved in a broad range of essential cellular processes. These
metabolites, and their derivatives, are essential intermediates in glycolytic pathways leading to the production of ATP and
are further used in the glycosylation of proteins and other macromolecules as part of the biosynthetic-secretory pathway.
In humans, glucose is absorbed in the small intestine by enterocytes and delivered to the bloodstream. Blood glucose
concentrations are tightly regulated by hormonal control and conserved reabsorption mechanisms in the kidneys. Secondary
active transporters facilitate these absorption/reabsorption processes as well as the exclusive delivery of activated sugar
molecules to the ER and Golgi. Disturbances in these functions are associated with numerous human disorders, such as type
II diabetes. It is, therefore, a critical objective of biomedical research to understand the structural intricacies of these dynamic
transporters.
During my 15-year tenure as an independent investigator, my lab has produced a number of experimental firsts—the first
crystal structure of a sodium glucose transporter, the first crystal structure of the Voltage Dependent Anion Channel,
and the firsts to use these coordinates for their biochemical and biophysical characterization. The last five years have been
extremely fruitful for my lab. We have complimented these original structures with new structures in distinct conformations
and incorporated their biophysical characterization in effort to elucidate their transport mechanisms. These findings have
direct implications to our collective understanding of associated diseases and aid in drug development. This has been made
possible due to my long-standing R01 funded by NIGMS that is currently in its 14th year. Additionally, I was recently
awarded a new R01 that aims to elucidate the structural basis of transport for Nucleotide Sugar Transporters. These sources
of NIGMS funding have allowed my lab to answer fundamental questions regarding sugar transport and cellular processing.
This current proposal embodies the spirit of the MIRA funding scheme by allowing me to tackle bigger questions that are
frequently referred to as `Higher-Risk' or `Ambitious Science', but that are the results every scientist truly dreams of
acquiring. Elucidating the structure-function relationship of membrane transporters is particularly risky and requires a long-
term commitment and flexibility to explore different directions of research and methodologies and developing new
approaches. The stability and flexibility incorporated into the MIRA allows us to do exactly that: try new exploratory
research, which will not only determine structures of human transporters that are direct pharmaceutical targets, but also
delineate their mechanism of transport that will clearly be applicable to many other transporters in general."
10806243,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There are no approved therapies for the autosomal-recessive neuro- and cardio-degenerative disorder Friedreich
ataxia (FA). FA is caused by hypomorphic mutations in the gene encoding the protein frataxin. Frataxin localizes
to the mitochondrial matrix and functions in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur-clusters (ISCs), which are important
prosthetic groups for both intra- and extra-mitochondrial enzymes. We found that the p38 MAP kinase stress-
response pathway is constitutively hyperactivated in FA cells, likely as a result of ongoing oxidative stress and/or
an ongoing DNA damage response (DDR). Our working hypothesis is that chronic hyperactivation of the p38
pathway, which modulates a key protein in the ISC biogenesis complex, is part of a maladaptive feedback loop
that further suppresses ISC biogenesis in FA cells; hence, inhibition of the p38 pathway, or of its activation,
counteracts the deleterious effects of decreased frataxin function. Our preliminary studies have implicated lipid
peroxidation and telomere damage in FA pathogenesis, both of which activate p38, and both of which are
consequences of ISC deficiency. We hypothesize that ISC biogenesis in FA cells will be increased, and FA-
associated defects ameliorated, by (i) inhibition of p38 and/or MK2, which links p38 to ISC biogenesis; or (ii) a
reduction in p38 activation, either through a decrease in oxidative stress (particularly lipid peroxidation) or a
decrease in the DDR (particularly secondary to critical telomere shortening). Complemented by genetic
approaches, we will test compounds that are known to target these pathways, allowing us to elucidate the roles
of these pathways in FA pathogenesis while simultaneously advancing our overall goal of identifying and
prioritizing compounds for potential clinical development. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To use fibroblast
models to interrogate the interrelated roles of the p38-MAPK pathway, oxidative stress, and DNA
damage in the pathogenesis of FA, and to test relevant drugs and drug targets for amelioration
of FA-associated defects. We will test our hypothesis that constitutive hyperactivation of the p38 pathway in
FA cells represents a maladaptive feedback loop, and that inhibiting this pathway counteracts the deleterious
effects of decreased frataxin function, thereby ameliorating FA-associated defects. Using a combination of
genetic and small-molecule approaches, we will test the effects of antioxidants, anti-DDR agents, and p38/MK2
inhibition on p38 activation, ISC biogenesis, and FA-associated defects. Aims 2 and 3. To use FA iPSC-
derived cardiomyocytes and sensory neurons (Aim 2), and FA zebrafish (Aim 3), to test our
hypotheses in affected cell types in vitro and in vivo. Using a combination of genetic and small-molecule
approaches, we will test the effects of antioxidants, anti-DDR agents, and p38/MK2 inhibition on p38 activation,
ISC biogenesis, and FA-associated defects validated in these models. We anticipate a significant positive impact:
our preliminary studies already link these pathways to FA pathophysiology, and compounds targeting these
pathways have been developed and, in some cases, are already in clinical trials for other disorders."

This project addresses a need for less morbid alternatives to surgical drilling of growth plates in the treatment
of limb length discrepancies. Surgical approaches currently require 6 weeks of recovery before weight bearing,
which takes a physical and psychological toll on pediatric patients. Surgery has also been associated with
complications such as incomplete growth arrest, angular deformity, bleeding, and infection. We hypothesize
that microwave ablation – a technology already used for treating malignant and benign tumors throughout the
body, including in bones – can be used to disrupt the growth plate with fewer complications and faster return to
baseline activity. Preliminary data demonstrates the feasibility delivering microwave energy to create heating in
the growth plate when using clinical microwave tumor ablation systems in porcine tibias. This project will focus
on developing more optimal devices and techniques for growth plate ablation. Directional antennas will be
developed that target microwave energy to the growth plate while minimizing collateral damage. Dynamic
positioning and multi-applicator techniques will be used to further refine energy delivery to ensure complete
and uniform growth arrest. Finally, the safety and efficacy of the optimized techniques will be compared against
the gold-standard of surgical drilling in distal femur, proximal tibia, and fibula. If successful, these
developments and studies will form the basis for a novel and exciting treatment for limb length discrepancy in
children."
10803044,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Functional genomic studies have contributed enormously to our understanding of conserved genetic pathways
influencing aging in evolutionarily divergent organisms. The use of high throughput machinery and the
application of skilled manpower along with screening systematic gene knock-out in yeast and gene depletion
(RNA interference) in worm have led to the identification of several genes that influence life span. Some of
these genes have human orthologues and have been examined successfully in the context of invertebrate and
mammalian aging. Although, it is now clear that at least some aspects of cellular aging are highly conserved,
identification of conserved components of longevity pathways across evolutionarily divergent organisms has
lagged far behind. We will address this issue by analyzing the function of conserved essential genes in
regulation of longevity. Essential genes in yeast are approximately 5 times more likely to have human
orthologs than non-essential genes. For example, among the 1123 yeast essential genes, 856 of them have
both worm and human homologs. However, to date, despite the greater functional importance and high
conservation between species, there has been no comprehensive study to characterize the role of essential
genes in aging. Accordingly, the goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that essential genetic modifiers
of aging in yeast are more likely to play a conserved role in the aging process in multicellular eukaryotes. In a
complete screen of yeast and validation screen from worm strains with increased expression of one the
essential genes for which there is a clear human ortholog, we made the striking observation that essential
genes are much more likely than non-essential genes to play an important conserved role in lifespan
regulation. We propose to use recently developed tools to screen the conserved gene dosage effect on
lifespan using C. elegans (Aim 1). Next, we will identify genetic mechanisms of lifespan determination by
analyzing genome-scale patterns of age-associated mRNA expression changes in long living strains and
place new longevity genes into or out of known longevity pathways with genetic epistasis experiments (Aim 2).
In the last aim, we will provide proof of mechanistic concept by investigating the molecular mechanisms
underlying a promising, potentially conserved in humans, mode of longevity stemming from the overexpression
of conserved essential genes (Aim 3). Such genes are a rich, untapped source for understanding genetic
mechanisms of longevity determination. Thus, every hit represents a newly discovered longevity gene with a
conserved human ortholog. Successful completion of this proposal will yield a wealth of new information about
conserved mechanisms of molecular determination of aging and will identify dozens of candidate genes for
testing in higher eukaryotes with important ramifications for healthy human aging."

 The goal of this grant is to develop enabling technology to address fundamental limitations in robotic
intraocular microsurgery with a specific focus on high-dexterity micromanipulation. Vitreoretinal surgery may be
the most technically demanding type of eye surgery and deals with the surgical treatment of retinal and posterior
segment diseases. Following the trend in microsurgery, robotic assistance, enhanced by advanced imaging, has
the potential to fundamentally change the field of intraocular surgery. Still in its early stages, robotic retinal
surgery has been cautiously introduced into the operating room and has been successfully evaluated in a limited
number of clinical trials. Owing to its demonstrated capabilities, robotic intraocular microsurgery has the potential
to assist the surgeon and provide super-human physical capabilities, enabling unprecedented as well as safer
surgical care for patients. Among the most relevant procedural tasks that may benefit from the use of robotic
assistance is epiretinal membrane (ERM) peeling, the most common vitreoretinal surgery performed in the US.
The incidence of intra and postoperative complications ranges from 2% to 30%, depending on the circumstances.
The main complication is varying degrees of mechanical retinal trauma that result from accessing the membrane
edge or due to excess forces applied during membrane removal. Current limitations and challenges of robotic
approaches include logistically cumbersome setup, limited access to important portions of the retina, and lack of
force feedback to the surgeon at the tool tip and shaft. Similar problems exist in laparoscopic surgery. To date,
non-ocular robotic systems have demonstrated significant dexterity enhancement by integrating additional
degrees of freedom and force-sensing capabilities at the distal end of the surgical instruments.
 To prove the hypothesis that a high-dexterity robotic assistant will overcome important limitations in
conventional ophthalmic microsurgical procedures, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Clinically
compatible high-dexterity robotic system: develop a miniature robotic forceps with snake-like distal end, and
embed optical fibers-based sensors on the tool shaft, allowing force-sensing at both the tool tip and sclerotomy,
and integrate the dexterous manipulator with the Steady Hand Eye Robot (SHER); (2) Control methods for high-
dexterity robotic system: develop teleoperated control for the dexterous manipulator and SHER, combine
teleoperated and cooperative control for the integrated system, and develop control schemes able to assist the
surgeon with sensorimotor guidance for safe robotic ERM peeling; (3) Validate the high-dexterity robotic system
for ERM peeling: validate the capabilities of the proposed system for ERM peeling with established ex-vivo
phantoms (membrane of fertilized chicken eggs) and in-vivo biological membranes (pig eyes). This highly
innovative system will fuse tool-tissue force information with intraoperative guidance via a high-dexterity robotic
assistant surgical platform with cooperative and teleoperated control."

Eukaryotic protein kinases regulate important cellular processes through their ability to phosphorylate
themselves and substrate proteins. One of the phosphorylation events common to most protein kinases is the
phosphorylation that occurs at the activation loop. This phosphorylation event often occur via auto-
phosphorylation although how an inactive kinase achieves the phospho-transfer reaction on its own activation
loop site is still unclear [2]. We recently reported that activation of dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-
regulated kinases 1A and 1B (DYRK1A and DYRK1B) requires prolyl-hydroxylation by the oxygen sensing
prolyl hydroxylase PHD1. DYRK1 activation by prolyl-hydroxylation instigates a sequence of events whereby
phosphorylation of ID2 by DYRK1 releases ID2 mediated constraints on VHL ubiquitin ligase tumor
suppressor complex, thus regulating the degradation of HIF proteins in brain tumors and cancer stem cells.
Our most recent work identified prolyl hydroxylation by PHD1 as the general mechanism required in trans to
prime protein kinases of the CMGC family for autophosphorylation and activation. Beside DYRK1, CMGC
kinases includes Cyclin dependent kinases (C), Mitogen activated protein kinases (M), Glycogen synthase
kinases (G) and CDC-like kinases (C). In this proposal we will follow the long-standing interest of the lab on
the molecular pathways that favor neural cell self-renewal during brain development and are aberrantly
recruited during gliomagenesis and investigate the mode of regulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3),
a central hub in the control of brain functions and oncogenesis. GSK3 shares with other members of the
CMGC kinase family the highly conserved CMGC insert domain. We found that this domain harbors a L/xGxP
motif and the highly conserved proline residue, Pro-276, which is targeted by hydroxylation by the proline
hydroxylase enzyme PHD1 and is necessary for kinase activation.
These observations led us to propose a combination of mechanistic and genetic studies to define the
dynamics of GSK3a/b kinase maturation induced by PHD1 and the interaction with other signaling
mechanisms that regulate GSK3 kinase activity. The significance of proline hydroxylation for gliomagenesis
will be investigated in knock-in mouse models of Pro to Ala mutation of GSK3a/b (Pro-339 and Pro-276,
respectively). Mouse tumors will be analyzed using proteomics and phosphoproteomics to reconstruct the
activity of wild type and mutant GSK3 kinases. Given the uncertain role of GSK3 kinases in cancer and
glioblastoma (promoter or suppressor), findings will lead to a better understanding of the potential
benefit/harm of GSK3 inhibitors that are currently proposed for the treatment of glioblastoma."

Immune cells are an integral part of the white adipose tissue microenvironment and have pronounced effects on
the expansion and activation of thermogenic adipocytes, also known as beige/brite adipocytes. Anti-inflammatory
factors are postulated to be beneficial for insulin resistance and diabetes. We recently reported that ablation of
interleukin-10 (IL10)-associated anti-inflammatory signaling in mice, surprisingly, improved insulin sensitivity and
glucose tolerance, protected against diet-induced obesity, and elicited browning of white adipose tissue. Yet,
several questions remain about the mechanisms that mediate the metabolic actions of IL10: i) how does IL10
block adipose thermogenesis? ii) what are the fates of adipocytes deficient in IL10 signaling? and, iii) since IL10
is produced by multiple immune cell types, which adipose-resident immune cell is responsible for IL10
production? Our proposal builds upon our comprehensive data to address the crosstalk between immune cells
and adipocytes within adipose tissue depots in regulating systemic metabolism and adipose thermogenesis. Our
published and pilot studies show that interfering with IL10 activity in adipocytes is associated with increased
mitochondrial respiration and energy expenditure. Reconstitution of wild-type bone marrow into IL10 knockout
mice reversed the thermogenic phenotype. Ablation of adipose T cells increased adipose thermogenesis,
pointing to a hematopoietic origin of the IL-10 signal regulating adipose tissue function. The IL10 receptor
(IL10Ra) is highly expressed in mature adipocytes, and adipocyte-specific knockdown of IL10Ra decreases fat
mass and increases adipose thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Conversely, IL10 treatment directly
antagonizes the expression of thermogenic genes in a cell-autonomous manner. Furthermore, genome-wide
Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-seq, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq demonstrated that IL-10
represses the transcription of thermogenic genes by altering chromatin configuration at key enhancer and
promoter regions through STAT3. Our findings identify the “IL10-IL10Ra-STAT3 axis” as a novel regulator of the
thermogenic transcriptional program in adipose tissue and challenge conventional assumptions regarding links
between immune and inflammatory signaling and adipose tissue function in obesity. To further test the
hypothesis that adipocyte-specific IL10Ra directly “senses” IL10 in the microenvironment to limit adipose
thermogenesis and energy expenditure, I propose three Specific Aims to define: i) mechanisms underlying IL10
inhibition of thermogenic gene transcription and beige adipocyte formation; ii) the fates of adipocytes in the
presence and absence of IL10Ra, and iii) adipose resident immune cells responsible for anti-thermogenic
activities."
10802985,"A common reason cited for dental composite replacement is the recurrence of caries around existing restorations
due to microbial activity. Treatment typically involves the removal of decayed tooth structure and placement of a
new restoration. Since the microbial environment remains the same, the new tooth-restoration complex may also
be susceptible to failure. Thus, the problem is not adequately addressed in current dental treatment approaches.
More innovative materials are required that can purposefully bias the microbial environment toward improved
health. Our preliminary data demonstrate that Mg2+ or Zn2+ released from bioactive glass (BAG)-containing resin
composites can support a healthy microbial environment, thus directly addressing the root of the caries problem.
Here we propose a new strategy involving Mg2+-and Zn2+-releasing dental composites that can favorably alter
the microbiome on and around dental restorations such that the local pH >5.5.
AIM 1: Optimize Mg2+- and Zn2+-releasing bioactive glass (BAG)-containing dental composites for long-term
support of a healthy oral microbiome. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be used to optimize pH
dependent Mg2+ and Zn2+ release kinetics from different Mg- and Zn-BAG formulations. Later, dental plaque
derived multi species biofilm growth rate, volume, species composition and pH at the BAG surface will be
quantified and optimized such that local pH > 5.5. AIM 2: Test the effectiveness of new Mg-BAG and Zn-BAG
composites in an in vitro secondary caries model. Placement of a restoration has the inherent challenge of gap
formation between the dental material and the tooth structure. Currently, little information is available on how
bacteria behave in microgaps. For example, microbial colonization, diffusion rates, and organic acid metabolites
may be very different within gaps as compared to exposed surfaces in the oral cavity, potentially leading to
enhanced tooth decay at the interface. Here we will develop an in vitro microgap model using the electrochemical
sensors techniques to measure the biological activity and the effect on the microbial population in these
microenvironments such that local pH > 5.5. AIM 3: In situ evaluation of Mg-BAG and Zn-BAG composites with
intraoral appliances. The cytotoxicity of Mg-BAG and Zn-BAG will be tested using undifferentiated dental pulp
cells compared to standard dental composites. The in vitro optimized Mg-BAG and Zn-BAG composites that are
shown to have equal or lower cytotoxicity than typical composite will be placed in intraoral appliances to be
tested in volunteers. This real-life scenario will evaluate the effectiveness of the composites when all biologically
relevant parameters are present that potentially interfere with the performance of Mg-BAG and Zn-BAG
composites. This will also provide a direct comparison between the in vitro model and the clinical situation. Our
proposal will lay the foundation for further metal ions driven research on biofilm growth and behavior, as well as
for the development of a more realistic in vitro secondary caries model that includes chemical microenvironments
created by differential biofilm metabolic activities within microscopic gaps."

The cardiac conduction system (CCS) is specialized in the generation and propagation of electrical impulses
from the atria to the ventricles to produce a highly coordinated muscle contraction. Cardiac conduction disorders
(CCDs) including sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular block (AVB), and bundle branch block are common
arrhythmic disorders that impact the contraction of atria or ventricles. Cardiac pacing is the standard treatment
for patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmia resulting in implantation of over 600,000 pacemakers annually in
US due to sinus node dysfunction (SND) or AVB. Currently, there is no alternative treatment for these patients.
Thus, understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to CCD may provide a foundation for new
therapeutic strategies. A nonsense mutation (c.C673>T, p.R225>X) in lamin A/C (LMNA) identified in a kindred,
was associated progressive CCD and atrial arrhythmias, preceding the development of cardiomyopathy and
heart failure. The mechanistic link between mutated lamin A/C and CCD is largely undetermined. Preliminary
results suggest that the LMNA-R255X knockin mice develop CCD phenotype, similar to patient carriers of R225X
mutation. The proposed work will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which mutation in lamin A/C promote
CCD. Our study will establish the pathological function of lamin A/C in CCD development. The molecular
pathways uncovered from this study will likely have a broader impact on our understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of CCD in the general population."

Talkers’ pronunciations of segments, syllables, and words—and thus ultimately meaning—can differ
substantially depending on physiology, social identity, and language background. Scientific breakthroughs over
the last four decades have determined that listeners accommodate these differences by adapting their
interpretation of incoming speech for different talkers. However, what perceptual, linguistic, and cognitive
mechanisms achieve these adaptive changes has remained unclear. This status quo is recognized as a
major roadblock in advancing the field, limiting effective knowledge transfer to clinical and physiological research.
To address this question, we capitalize on two recent innovations from our team: a comprehensive
computational framework of adaptive speech perception (ASP) and a model-guided approach to high-
powered contrastive experiment design. ASP—for the first time—implements competing hypotheses about
how changes in perception, linguistic representations, and decision-making might jointly or separately contribute
to spoken language understanding. The model-guided design approach allows contrastive tests of these
hypotheses against human behavior. We use this approach to investigate one of the most complex adaptive
feats of human speech perception: adaptation to unfamiliar non-native accents. In 16 large-scale web-based
experiments (total N > 2,880 listeners), we investigate what combinations of mechanisms best explain such
adaptation, and how the engagement of different mechanisms depends on 1) specific acoustic-phonetic
properties of the accent, 2) the duration and amount of input, ranging from the first utterances to repeated
exposure over up to 12 months, and 3) cognitive demands and contextual affordances. Independent of these
primary goals, the proposed experiments make significant empirical, methodological, and theoretical
contributions to research on the perception of accents. This includes a new production database of Mandarin-
accented speech (the 2nd most commonly heard non-native accent in the US, incl. in healthcare contexts), new
insights on the perceptual and cognitive factors supporting accent adaptation; and new comparisons of
adaptation to different segmental and prosodic properties, some of which may require more exposure than
others. Our longitudinal testing extending over 12 months will be the critical first step towards understanding how
rapid adaptive changes in the first few minutes of exposure could lead to the well-known, long-lasting benefits of
talker and accent familiarity in speech perception. Finally, our data and computational models—both shared
without embargo in the form of open-access R libraries—will serve as a key resource for future experimental and
computational research, supporting effective and rigorous hypothesis testing."
10802749,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of gut-brain interaction that affects up to 20% of school children
worldwide. Dietary interventions, particularly those removing fermentable oligosaccharides disaccharides
monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) carbohydrates from the diet, may be helpful in both adults and children
with IBS. Unfortunately, there are significant practical and potential health challenges (e.g., unintended weight
loss) to following a FODMAP restriction diet. Identifying new therapies beyond dietary restriction alone for
FODMAP-induced symptoms, particularly in children, is needed.
 Fructans are a type of FODMAP that are naturally occurring, abundant in our diet, and are a major focus
of restriction in the low FODMAP diet. After ingestion, fructans arrive in the colon essentially intact where they
are fermented rapidly by gut microbiota. We identified that a subset (~50%) of children with IBS are fructan-
sensitive meaning they experience worsening abdominal pain when fed fructans. The biggest distinguishing
feature between those who are fructan-sensitive vs. fructan tolerant (do not develop worsening pain) is a distinct
microbial composition and fermentation pattern. These data suggest fructan fermentation by the gut microbiota
is an important factor in determining whether subsequent gastrointestinal symptoms develop.
 Psyllium is a viscous, soluble, poorly fermented fiber that we demonstrated in children with IBS decreases
abdominal pain frequency. However, psyllium efficacy is modest and the mechanism by which it ameliorates IBS
is unknown. Importantly, a recent study reported that psyllium administered concurrently with fructans affected
fructan fermentation: Adults who consumed fructans with psyllium (vs. fructans alone) had both decreased
colonic gas production and overall colonic volume. This means psyllium represents a potentially important clinical
intervention that may avoid the need for dietary fructan (and other FODMAPs) restriction and needs to be tested.
 To begin to investigate psyllium treatment for FODMAP (fructan)-induced pain, we will first identify children
with IBS who are fructan-sensitive using our established randomized crossover protocol. Following a two-week
baseline period In those who are fructan-sensitive (n=45), we then propose a two-week double-blind randomized
parallel-group study in which participants receive either psyllium (1 g/year of age or 0.5 g/year of age per day)
with fructans or a placebo (glucose) with fructans. Our central hypothesis is that psyllium given with fructans to
fructan-sensitive children with IBS will decrease colonic fermentation of fructans and fructan-induced
gastrointestinal symptoms. The Specific Aims of the project are to: 1) Investigate the effect of psyllium at two
doses given with a fructan meal on microbial fructan fermentation; 2) Determine the effect of psyllium given with
a fructan meal on fructan-induced gastrointestinal symptoms. The knowledge gained will lay the foundation for
future longer-term comparative studies assessing psyllium given with meals vs. other interventions (e.g.,
restrictive low FODMAP diet) for FODMAP-induced symptoms in children with IBS."
10798148,"ABSTRACT: Our work over the last several years, indicates that cell cycle regulatory pathways are critical
determinants of the response to endocrine therapy as well as targeted therapies that are frequently employed
in the treatment of ER+ metastatic breast cancer. Here we will focus on the RB-tumor suppressor pathway as
a central node controlling proliferation downstream of multiple pathways of relevance to therapy of ER+ breast
cancer (e.g. endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors). While RB is required for the effective cytostatic
response to a range of targeted therapies employed in ER+ breast cancer, multiple pathways can contribute to
“cell cycle plasticity” and therefore represent distinct means for generating therapeutic resistance. Here we will
delineate the processes underlying this form of resistance, means to elicit durable cell cycle arrest, and
approaches to target resistance as observed clinically (Aim 1). Our data and newly published studies indicate
that RB loss occurs in ER+ breast cancer as a means to escape from cytostatic therapies. Analysis of the RB
locus in ER+ breast cancer indicates loss of one copy of 13q occurs in a significant fraction of ER+ breast
cancers, suggesting that such tumors are primed for RB loss. How to subsequently treat tumors that are
heterogeneous for RB or are solely RB deficient represents a significant challenge. Using drug screening and
organoid approaches we have defined several regimens that are particularly effective against RB-negative
tumors and could represent a general means to target ER+ tumors that progress on CDK4/6 inhibitors (Aim 2).
Together these aims will interrogate means to further leverage the RB tumor suppressor for a precision
approach to the treatment of ER+ breast cancer."

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have cancer chemopreventive activity, but are not
recommended for long-term use because of toxicities resulting from cyclooxygenase (COX)
inhibition. However, sulindac and its congener, indomethacin (indo) inhibit the growth and induce
apoptosis of tumor cells in vitro and are potentially effective for treating malignant disease by
mechanisms that appear to be unrelated to COX inhibition. The Piazza lab has identified a novel
series of non-COX-inhibitory sulindac derivatives with potent tumor cell growth inhibitory activity
by targeting cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) isozymes, PDE5 and/or PDE10 to induce cGMP
signaling. MCI-030 is a prototypic non-COX-inhibitory sulindac derivative with selectivity for
PDE10 inhibition and strong in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity. Collaborative efforts from the
Zhou and Piazza laboratories discovered that sulindac, MCI-030, as well as a sulindac congener,
indomethacin (indo) are capable of inducing ER stress in tumor cells and can sensitize lymphoma
cells to T cells engineered to express CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptors (CD19CAR).
These findings establish the premise of our hypothesis that it is feasible to design and develop
novel sulindac derivatives with potent tumor cell growth inhibitory and immunostimulatory
activities by targeting PDE5 and/or PDE10. The objective of our study is to define the molecular
and cellular mechanisms by which sulindac and its non-COX derivatives condition an
immunogenic tumor microenvironment. Specifically, we will determine how sulindac and non-
COX inhibitory derivatives induce cancer immunogenic cell death, mitigate Treg and MDSC-
mediated immunosuppression, and activate dendritic cells via effects on tumor cells involving ER
stress induction, and suppression of oncogenic β-catenin, which we hypothesize are triggered by
PDE5/10 inhibition (aim 1). We will test the effectiveness of sulindac and non-COX inhibitory
derivatives that inhibit PDE5 and/or PDE10 in potentiating cancer immunotherapies including PD1
blockade and adoptive T cell therapy in multiple preclinical models (aim 2). Knowledge obtained
from Aim 1 and 2 will be integrated into a synthetic chemistry campaign to develop new sulindac
derivatives with improved antitumor activity by directly suppressing tumor cell growth and by
indirectly activating antitumor immunity, without the toxicities associated with COX inhibition (aim
3). Successful completion of the project will pave the way for developing novel sulindac
derivatives as immunomodulators for cancer treatment in the arena of cancer immunotherapies."

Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the sixth most prevalent cancer in the world, and oral cancer is the most
common subtype. The World Health Organization estimates ~330,000 deaths per year globally. The overall
survival rate (50-60%) has not improved over the past couple of decades, despite significant improvements in
surgical procedure, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The risk factors associated with oral cancer includes
tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, betel quid chewing, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
HPV infection is likely to be reduced in the future due to successful vaccination and better prognosis. There is
a critical need to define the HNC disease processes, and to identify better therapeutic strategies for successful
HNC patient management. Further, non-traditional therapies must be investigated as adjuncts to reduce the
risk of recurrence and improve survival. In our current funding period, we made several important novel
observations. We showed that bitter melon extract feeding alters c-Met signaling and prevents HNC growth in
preclinical models. We subsequently showed an immunomodulatory role of bitter melon extract, although the
precise mechanism is yet to be determined. Further, we found several long non-coding RNAs are altered in
feeding of bitter melon extract in a carcinogen-induced model. Very recently, we identified momordicine-I, one
of the active metabolites of bitter melon, which shows therapeutic anti-tumor activity in an oral cancer
preclinical model. Although we gained much evidence for bitter melon in prevention of HNC from our and other
studies, considerable knowledge gaps remain in understanding the mechanism of momordicine-I on tumor
metabolism and immune regulation, and its therapeutic use. Based on our and others results, we hypothesize
that combining momordicine-I with other current therapeutics will improve efficacy in tumor regression. We will
also examine the changes in glucose and lipid metabolism and the tumor microenvironment after treatment
with momordicine-I using a mouse model. Results from this study will have important translational implications
and significant benefits along with current therapy.
Innovation: Our study will examine for the first time the therapeutic and mechanistic effects of momordicine-I
in HNC animal models for major translational impact."

 South Africa has the world’s largest HIV population with approximately 7.52 million people with HIV
(PWH). Prevalence of HIV associated neurocognitive impairment is high (23% to 76%) and remains highly
prevalent even among those virally suppressed. Yet, no cognitive rehabilitation program had been adapted for
PWH in this setting. Cognitive remediation training is a promising intervention to improve cognitive skills for
PWH and cognitive impairment. We will combine two predominant cognitive remediation training intervention
strategies, Compensatory Cognitive Training, a behavioral skills training approach to help patients acquire
cognitive and functional skills, and restorative Computer Cognitive Remediation Training to improve cognition.
Combining these two strategies to address deficits in a range of cognitive domains (e.g., speed of information
processing and working memory) has shown, across a variety of psychiatric disorders and in aging
populations, to result in the greatest improvement in everyday functioning, mood, locus of control, and quality
of life. Before efficacy of cognitive remediation training can be determined via randomized controlled trial in this
setting, cognitive remediation training must be adapted for use in South Africa, and randomized control trial
methodology for this setting must be established. We propose to adapt and combine CogSMART (Cognitive
Symptom Management and Rehabilitation Therapy), evidence-based Compensatory Cognitive Training, and
SmartBrainã, evidence-based Computer Cognitive Remediation, for use in PWH who also have neurocognitive
impairment, in South Africa; and to explore barriers to its use and future implementation in public clinics
through patient and provider interviews.
 During Phase 1 of the study we will 1) develop infrastructure to implement cognitive remediation training at
primary health care clinics in Cape Town, and 2) use a PWH Work Group and an Intervention Work Group
composed of neuropsychologists and occupational therapists to identify how Cognitive Remediation Training
must be adapted to culturally match this setting. After implementing the changes and translating (using gold
standard methods) instructions to Xhosa, the predominant regional language, Phase 2 of the study will 1) pilot
test the adapted Cognitive Remediation Training among 40 South African PWH in a Cape Town primary health
care clinic; and 2) evaluate usability and acceptability of this training for a future randomized control trail. Two
lay counsellors will administer the training. Randomized control trial methodology, acceptability and feasibility
will assess: 1) proposed recruitment strategy (e.g., eligibility of screeners and screening criteria); 2)
randomization procedures; 3) pre- and post-intervention assessments (e.g., cognition, ART adherence, HIV
health, mental health, and functional status); and 4) retention strategy. Cognitive Remediation Training
acceptability and feasibility will assess 1) patient user experience; and 2) lay counselor experience with
intervention administration."

Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and
sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The
introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice
there are still substantial challenges at managing the optimal care for individual cases due to difficulties of
accurately assessing the potential progression and its speed and magnitude. These difficulties are due to a
variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large inter-subject variability, inherent
measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of
tissues, etc. In this proposal, we propose novel agnostic data-driven deep learning approaches to detect
glaucoma and accurately forecast its progression that are optimized to each individual case. We will use state-
of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify
structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression
without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very
encouraging preliminary results. Instead of relying on the conventional knowledge-based approaches (e.g.
quantifying tissues known to be significantly associated with glaucoma such as retinal nerve fiber layer), the
proposed cutting-edge agnostic deep learning approaches determine the features responsible for future
structural and functional changes out of thousands of features autonomously by learning from the provided
large longitudinal dataset. This program will advance the use of structural and functional information obtained
in the clinics with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma. Furthermore, the
developed methods have potentials to be applied to various clinical applications beyond glaucoma and
ophthalmology."

The history of glial cells is neglected in comparison to that of neurons, and this holds true a
decade after the first grant application. We can debate about the possible reasons, including the
fact that glial cells remain on the fringe of neuroscience, likely because they do not carry nerve
impulse and cannot be compared to computers and Artificial Intelligence. A way to enhance the
second-class citizen status of glial cells is writing their history. We are currently completing a
humanities history book encompassing all glial cell types in the body. We aim for an historical
narrative including interactions of glial cells with neurons limited to 5 years ago to avoid scientific
artefacts. A decade and several thousands computer files later, the book manuscript merely feels
like the tip of an iceberg, despite being a significant dent in the historical treasures waiting to be
discovered and translated. The sheer amount of newly discovered material on glia is mind-
boggling. This application requests funds to complete a thorough historical account from glia
perspective, organized at the cellular level and presenting an up-to-date landscape of all glial cell
type interactions with neurons. The book entices writing significant new material for both PI and
contributors since no glia history book exists. Twenty two contributors and the PI spent a
considerable amount of time to write and research their chapter, often in vast excess of words
and references because writing from scratch. The editors successfully negotiated with publisher
Wiley a word count increase from 160k to 200k. The current challenge is to finish writing and
comply with this word limitation. Practically, a history book will guide scientific readership through
the recent explosion of literature that is challenging to capture the whole picture of glia role in the
nervous system. A widely acknowledged consensus among scientific historians is that an
historical perspective on how our understanding of the nervous system has advanced will lead to
new insights on how further advances can be made. No neurological diseases can be understood
without an integrated concept of the complexity of glial cells within neuronal networks."
10785193,"Detecting Reversal of Apoptosis in Cancer Cells in Mice
Project Summary
Targeting apoptotic pathways is one of the most important therapeutic strategies for cancer treatments,
and primary cancers often exhibit dramatic initial responses to such treatments. However, most
metastatic cancers inevitably recur, leading to treatment failure. The classical view of apoptosis has
long assumed that, once initiated, this cell suicide process is irreversible. Challenging this assumption
is our recent highly original discovery that apoptosis can be reversible, even at late stages, in multiple
human cancer cell lines in vitro. We named this cell recovery mechanism “anastasis”, which means
“rising to life” in Greek. Removal of a death stimulus is sufficient to allow anastasis to occur, thus
indicating that anastasis is an intrinsic recovery phenomenon. We hypothesize that anastasis is an
unexpected escape tactic used by cancer cells to survive cell-death-inducing cancer therapy, thereby
causing cancer recurrence. If this hypothesis is true, anastasis would be a novel therapeutic target for
suppressing cancer recurrence and progression. However, anastasis in cancer cells in vivo has yet to
be demonstrated, and the consequences of anastasis remain undiscovered. To detect anastasis in live
animals, we have successfully developed a new biosensor to label anastatic cells in fruit flies, by
fluorescently tagging cells that have reversed apoptosis. This permanent tag is a unique tool for
detecting and following the consequences of anastasis in vivo. Here, we will apply the similar strategy
to detect and track anastasis in cancer cells in mice. By incorporating biosensor-expressing human
cancer cells with three clinically relevant xenograft mouse models of cancer relapse, we will determine
whether anastasis occurs in cancer cells in vivo, and if identified, whether it contributes to recurrence
after anti-cancer therapy. Our results will lay a strong foundation for developing anastasis-targeting
anti-cancer therapy, by generating essential animal models for studying the consequences of anastasis,
and by revealing the therapeutic potential of harnessing anastasis to suppress cancer recurrence."
10798197,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by profound affective dysregulation. Periods of aversive symptoms
(depression, anxiety, decreased appetitive drive), alternate with mania (a state of enhanced appetitive drive for
reward and pleasure). The clinical manifestation is heterogeneous, with diverse patterns of predominant
symptoms, severity and duration. Notably, there are no current robust neurocircuit models to account for these
clinical manifestations. Imaging and postmortem studies point to the amygdala, a nucleus embedded in circuits
involved in threat and reward responses. Recent breakthroughs from our group and others are beginning to
characterize molecularly identifiable, functionally divergent sets of amygdala neurons, which separately encode
and regulate aversive and appetitive behaviors. Specifically, distinct neuronal types within the mouse amygdala
promote aversive/fear responses (`FEAR-ON' neurons), vs. appetitive/reward responses (`APPT-ON' neurons).
Our preliminary data using single-cell RNA sequencing show that analogous molecularly defined neuronal
populations are present in human amygdala. Our overarching hypothesis is that neuronal populations
impacting valence encoding and motivated behavior (FEAR-ON vs. APPT-ON neurons), are disrupted in BD,
contributing to depression, anxiety and mania.
What factors may regulate the functions of FEAR-ON and APPT-ON circuitry in health and disease states? An
answer may lie within the distinctive molecular signatures of these neurons, consistent with their opposing
functions. First, FEAR-ON and APPT-ON neurons express distinct molecular factors known to regulate
fear/threat and reward processing within the amygdala, including anxiogenic (e.g. corticotropic releasing
hormone [CRH]) and anxiolytic (e.g. neurotensin receptor 2 [NTSR2]) factors, respectively. Second, a well-
validated distinguishing feature of amygdala FEAR-ON and APPT-ON neurons is their distinct expression pattern
of Wnt/β catenin signaling molecules. This feature indicates that Wnt/β catenin pathways differentially regulate
FEAR-ON and APPT-ON neurons. Pilot data also show altered expression of key molecules, including Wnt7a
and CRH in the amygdala of people with BD. Our specific hypothesis is that cell-specific FEAR-ON and APPT-
ON molecular factors modulating stress/anxiety and reward/appetitive behaviors are altered in BD, and that
disruption of Wnt/β catenin pathways contributes to distinct abnormalities FEAR-ON and APPT-ON neurons.
Human postmortem studies combining single-cell RNAseq, multiplex mRNA/protein cell labeling and quantitative
analyses of RDoC clinical domains will test the hypothesis that quantifiable clinical `fingerprints' in BD are
predictive of distinct patterns of molecular changes in FEAR-ON and APPT-ON neurons (Aims 1 and 2). Causal
manipulation in mouse genetic models will mechanistically test the hypothesis that a disruption of Wnt signaling
causally alters expression of reward- and stress- related molecules in circuits linking deep amygdala nuclei to
the CE and nucleus accumbens (Aim 3)."
10798313,"The goal of this proposal is to better characterize the cognitive and neural basis of face perception
heterogeneity in developmental prosopagnosia (DP) and to test whether potential perceptual subtypes are
better suited for one type of cognitive training program vs. another. This is relevant to the National Eye
Institute's mission to better treat visual disorders and understand mechanisms of visual function. Our pilot
results (N=45 DPs) provide preliminary evidence that there are perceptually-impaired (PI-DPs) and
perceptually-unimpaired (PU-DPs) DP subgroups that may be mechanistically distinct. We find that PI-DPs
have deficient eye processing, reduced holistic processing abilities, reduced N170 response to eye contrast-
reversed faces, and a trend towards decreased white matter integrity in the occipital face area, a face-selective
region involved in face parts processing. We also find that PI-DPs, compared to PU-DPs, show a greater
treatment response to our computerized face perception training program. The goals of the current proposal
are to build on these pilot results to further test and validate the PI-DP vs. PU-DP subgroup distinction, to
better understand the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual heterogeneity in DPs, and to examine
treatment implications of potential subgroups. In particular, our aims for this proposal are to: 1) Collect a large
sample of web-based and in-lab DPs (N=280) and controls (N=140) and replicate our pilot findings showing
eye processing and holistic processing deficits in PI-DPs. We will also perform latent profile analysis to
determine if DPs naturally form PI-DP vs. PU-DP subgroups or rather represent a continuum of face
perception deficits. 2) Characterize the neural mechanisms of DP face perception heterogeneity using
functional fMRI, EEG, and diffusion tensor imaging in 80 DPs and 40 controls. To test better understand the
neural underpinnings of DPs' reduced eye region sensitivity and reduced holistic processing, we seek examine
the N170 event-related potential response to isolated eyes vs. mouths as well as face inversion and for fMRI,
population receptive fields of face-selective regions as well as responses to isolated mouths and eyes. We will
also examine whether PI-DPs vs. PU-DPs have white matter integrity differences in face-selective white matter
regions. 3) Determine whether PI-DPs vs. PU-DPs have differential responses to face perception training, face
memory training, or face perception+face memory training programs. This will involve a longitudinal study of
120 DPs being assigned to either a waitlist control condition or 6 weeks of one of the three cognitive training
programs. Before and after training/waiting, we will assess DPs on a validated battery of face perception and
recognition tests as well as self-reported face recognition. To measure the longevity of potential training
effects, DPs will also repeat assessments after a 6-week no-contact period."

Jamaica’s HIV/AIDS epidemic among sexual and gender minorities is the most severe in the Caribbean in
terms of its breadth and consequences. HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men is estimated at
33% and 51% among transgender women, which is significantly higher than the 1.8% observe in the general
population. Intersectional stigma (often related to intersecting identities) and violence are key drivers of poor
mental health and HIV care engagement, leading to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and low viral
suppression (21%). The goals of the proposed research are to 1) gain and understanding of the influences and
mechanisms by which intersectional stigma and violence impact mental health and engagement in HIV care;
and 2) refine our conceptual framework to aid in intervention development that assists sexual and gender
minorities to engage in HIV care. Candidate: I am a nurse-scientist with a background in health behavior
change theory and social determinants of health in the context of HIV. I am applying for a K23 Career
Development Award to obtain training, mentorship, and research experience to become an expert and
independent investigator in theory-based, behavioral intervention design to improve the health of sexual and
gender minorities in the Caribbean and in other low-resource settings. Mentoring: I have put together an
exceptional mentoring team with extensive experience in intersectional stigma measurement research, mental
health, and HIV treatment and prevention in resource-limited settings like Jamaica. Drs. Sheri Weiser and
Carol Dawson-Rose will serve as co-Primary mentors and bring complementary expertise in HIV treatment and
prevention, trauma, conceptual model framework refinement, and development and implementation of
behavioral interventions in resource-limited settings. My co-mentors, scientific advisor, and collaborator round
out my team to bring specific content and methods expertise and are based both in the United States and
Jamaica, including: Dr. Mallory Johnson (clinical psychologist, intervention design and evaluation; feasibility
implementation, ART adherence); Dr. Tor Neilands (psychology, quantitative methods, design and analysis of
longitudinal data); Dr. Sharlene Jarrett (clinical psychologist, mental health and HIV treatment in the Jamaican
context); Carmen Logie (clinical social worker, intersectionality and mixed methods research); Dr. Jae Sevelius
(clinical psychologist, intersectional stigma measurements, cognitive interviewing, and gender affirmation); Dr.
Anita Stewart (psychologist, measurement adaptation and testing expert); and Dr. Mark Padilla (medical
anthropologist, Caribbean sexualities researcher). Training: I propose to obtain training in acquiring
foundational knowledge in measures of intersectional stigma (adaptation and testing), advanced quantitative
training to collect and analysis skills, and to attain expertise in developing, piloting, and evaluating HIV
behavioral interventions. Training will be achieved through mentoring meetings, coursework, workshops,
mentored direct readings and primary research in Jamaica. Research: The goals of the proposed research are
to 1) identify the pathways between intersectional stigma, violence, mental health and HIV care engagement
among Jamaican sexual and gender minorities living with HIV; 2) develop and manualize a multi-level
intervention that addresses intersectional stigma, violence, and poor mental health in order to optimize HIV
care engagement among Jamaican sexual and gender minorities living with HIV; and 3) pilot test the multi-
level intervention for acceptability and feasibility among sexual and gender minorities living with HIV and their
healthcare provider. We will plan for a full-scale testing of the intervention in a planned R01 submission in year
5. Summary: The recently announced Ending the HIV Epidemic (EtHE) by the DHHS and under Sustainable
Development Goal 3 of the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS highlight the pressing need for research to
address disparities among SGM and other key populations in the quest to halt HIV infections globally by 2030.
The proposed research and training activities will position me to conduct innovative, high-impact research to
address intersectional stigma, violence and mental health among SGM living with HIV in low-resource settings
to improve HIV treatment engagement."

10805699,"Chronic, low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) is a hallmark of aging and a major risk factor for both
morbidity and mortality as well as being a major risk factor for a variety of age-related diseases, including
neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the link between inflammation, aging, and age-associated diseases, the
molecular mechanism(s) responsible for inflammaging is poorly understood. The objective of my current Merit
VA grant was to determine if necroptosis, a cell death pathway that induces inflammation, played a role in
inflammaging. We showed for the first time that necroptosis increased with age in various tissues including brain
and was associated with an increase in various markers of inflammation. Importantly, we found that globally
inhibiting/blocking necroptosis reduced markers of inflammation, which supported our original hypothesis.
Interestingly, we found that the age-related increase in markers of necroptosis in the brain occurred primarily in
neurons in the hippocampus and cortex even though there is little, if any loss of neurons. Thus, the activation of
necroptosis in neurons does not appear to result in neuronal death. The overall objective of the current proposal
is to determine the mechanism(s) by which neuronal activation of necroptosis can impact the aging brain without
leading to neuronal death. We hypothesize that the activation of necroptosis in neurons leads to neuronal
dysfunction and the release of necroptotic extracellular vesicles, which induce neuroinflammation when
phagocytosed by microglia and/or astrocytes. We will test this hypothesis using mouse models in which
necroptosis activation is blocked or induced specifically in neurons, e.g., Ripk3fl/fl and Mlklfl/fl mice crossed to
transgenic Slick-H Cre transgenic mice to produce Ripk3NeuKO or MlklNeuKO mice in which necroptosis is blocked
and crossing Ripk3- or Mlkl-knockin mice to SLICK-H Cre-transgenic mice to produce Ripk3NeuOE or MlklNeuOE
mice, which overexpress RIPK3 or MLKL specifically in neurons. Using old (24- to 26-months) Ripk3NeuKO,
MlklNeuKO, Ripk3NeuOE, and MlklNeuOE mice compared to adult (6-months) and old wild type (WT) mice, we will
conduct the first experiments on the impact of necroptosis activation in a specific cell type (in this case neurons)
on inflammation and the function of a cell in the absence of cell death.
Aim 1. To determine the role of neuronal necroptosis activation in neuroinflammation. The impact of
reducing or inducing the activation of necroptosis in neurons on neuroinflammation in old mice will be assessed
by measuring proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and markers of neuroinflammation in various regions of
the brain. We predict that altering necroptosis specifically in neurons will in turn impact neuroinflammation.
Aim 2. To determine the mechanism of how neuronal necroptosis activation leads to
neuroinflammation. First, we will determine if blocking or inducing necroptosis activates specific populations of
microglia or astrocytes in the hippocampus using single-cell transcriptomics. Second, we will determine if altering
necroptosis activation in neurons leads to alterations in the ESCART-III pathway, which prevents the rupture of
the cell membrane by necroptosis. In addition, the levels of necroptotic EVs (containing MLKL and MLKL
oligomers) in the hippocampus will be measured in our mouse models. Third, we will determine if neuronal cell
cultures, in which necroptosis activation is induced, produce necroptotic EVs that are phagocytosed by cultures
of microglia, leading to the activation of microglia and the generation of proinflammatory cytokines/ chemokines.
Aim 3. To determine the role of neuronal necroptosis activation on neuronal function and cognition. The
effect of reducing or inducing neuronal necroptosis activation on neuronal function will be measured as calcium
dynamics and long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices and the transcriptome of hippocampal neurons.
Cognition (e.g., Morris water maze, Phenotyper, fear conditioning, novel object recognition) will be measured in
old Ripk3NeuKO, MlklNeuKO, Ripk3NeuOE, and MlklNeuOE mice and compared to adult and old WT mice."
10805923,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Repetitive, mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is increasingly seen in soldiers deployed to
combat areas and linked to persistent, debilitating neurological symptoms in Veterans. There is increasing
evidence that a major outcome of repetitive, mild TBI is chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This slowly
developing neurodegenerative condition is characterized by neuroinflammation and brain atrophy. Importantly,
CTE is also accompanied by cognitive impairment. A compound that could mitigate these pathologies and is
amendable to delivery to the brain could be the basis of a much needed pharmacotherapy. All trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) is an anti-inflammatory with neuromodulatory actions. We hypothesize that ATRA delivery to mice
months after receiving repetitive, mild TBIs will improve cognition and this will be linked to improved brain
pathology. To test this hypothesis we have developed nanoparticles for nose-to-brain drug delivery of ATRA
(ATRA-NP). We will test the efficacy of ATRA-NP using an established model of repetitive, mild TBI in mice.
Importantly, cognitive impairment is not apparent immediately after a series of head impacts, but ensues in the
weeks and months afterwards, mimicking the human condition. We will test the ability of intranasal ATRA-NP to
reverse cognitive impairment in these mice and investigate links to brain pathology postmortem. There are two
specific aims. The first aim will test the hypothesis that ATRA-NP delivery during the chronic phase after TBI will
improve cognitive impairment. The second aim will test the hypothesis that ATRA-NP delivery during the chronic
phase of TBI will improve brain pathology. The potential for impact of this work is high. A pharmacotherapy that
improves cognition could revolutionize care for Veterans and the general population. In addition to ATRA being
a strong candidate as a neuromodulator, it is also one of the most prescribed medications in the United States.
In addition, the nanoparticle drug carrier (PLG) is implemented in 19 FDA approved drug formulations. Thus, if
ATRA-NP is successful, getting this therapy to Veterans may be faster and less expensive than developing new
drugs. Finally, the delivery system is versatile, able to accommodate new or additional pharmaceutics or new
administration schedules, if necessary. Given that the investigative team has the required expertise to carry out
the proposed work, we are confident that the project will bring us closer to realizing a pharmacotherapy for
Veterans suffering from the persistent debilitating neurological symptoms secondary to traumatic brain injury."
10920457,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In 2022, more than 2 million middle and high school students reported current e-cigarette use. The availability
of flavored e-liquids makes e-cigarettes particularly appealing to youth, with nearly 85% reporting use of
flavored e-cigarettes. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken action to regulate flavored e-
cigarettes. In 2020, the agency banned prefilled, single-use cartridges containing e-liquids in ‘non-tobacco’
flavors (e.g., fruit, candy). It later targeted flavored disposable e-cigarettes—a previously unregulated device
type that quickly gained popularity among youth following the initial flavor ban. Until last April, the FDA did not
have regulatory authority over synthetic nicotine (vs. tobacco-derived nicotine), which some companies used
as a loophole to keep selling flavored e-cigarettes. The ‘partial’ nature of the FDA’s prior regulations enabled e-
cigarette manufacturers and retailers the opportunity to circumvent flavor regulations. However, six states (MD,
RI, NJ, NY, MA, UT) enacted additional flavored e-cigarette bans, which serve as natural experiments to
investigate whether more restrictive flavor bans are more effective in curtailing youth e-cigarette use.
Conversely, e-cigarettes may also function as potentially less harmful alternatives for adults who smoke
(AWS). Recent clinical trials report greater cigarette cessation rates among participants assigned to e-
cigarettes compared to nicotine replacement or counseling only, suggesting potential benefits for those
interested in quitting. Since flavored e-liquids are also highly preferred by AWS, e-cigarette flavor bans aimed
at reducing AYA e-cigarette use may unintentionally discourage AWS from switching to potentially less harmful
products. Thus, the project will examine the public health effects of stricter flavored e-cigarette regulations,
taking into account both the potential benefits and risks. Using the Population Assessment of Tobacco and
Health (PATH) Survey, we will investigate mechanisms by which statewide flavored e-cigarette bans affect e-
cigarette and other tobacco product use (risks) as well as smoking cessation and reduction (benefits). We will
leverage the longitudinal attribute of PATH to assess individual behavioral changes between subsequent
waves. Using a quasi-experimental event study difference-in-differences estimation design, we will examine (1)
changes in e-cigarette and cigarette use across age groups (12-17; 18-24 and 25+) and (2) use of e-cigarettes
as a tool to quit or reduce smoking among AWS. PATH also includes a rich dataset of tobacco-related
biomarkers, which we will analyze to further explore the impact of flavor bans. This study will contribute highly-
relevant data on the positive and negative impact of flavored e-cigarette bans. The proposal aligns with the
priorities outlined in RFA-OD-21-003 by examining the use pattern of flavored tobacco products and changes
in tobacco use following bans on flavored e-cigarette sales. The study team is comprised of tobacco regulatory
science and health policy researchers with the complementary expertise and skillsets needed to accomplish
the goals of the proposal."
10804973,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance use disorders (SUDs) drive persistent and long-lasting changes in the biochemical makeup of
neurons in the brain. For example, chronic cocaine use is known to cause the up-regulation of specific gene
networks, some of which are correlated across humans and animal SUD models. Prior in vivo studies in animal
SUD models have focused on mapping RNA changes within specific cell-types. However, it is the proteins (and
not the RNA) that serve as the final druggable molecules that directly alter neuronal function and can
potentially treat SUDs. Thus, it is critical to develop novel methodologies that aim to identify molecular
mechanisms of SUDs at the protein level within specific neuronal cell-types. Previous work has engineered
proximity-labeling enzymes (e.g. BioID, TurboID) that can chemically label nearby proteins with a small biotin
molecule. By expressing these enzymes within specific subcellular compartments within the neurons, it is
possible to tag and then enrich biotinylated proteins that are present within that sub-compartment. However, a
major limitation of these tools is that they are not activity-dependent; they will biotinylate proteins within a ~10-
20nm radius regardless of the cell-state or nearby receptor activation. Therefore, it is challenging to use them
to identify proteins that are dynamically recruited to an activated GPCR in response to drug use in vivo. Here
we will engineer new activity-dependent split-TurboID probes that will allow tagging of proteins nearby a drug-
activated GPCR. These proteins can then be enriched and analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem
mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). First, we will use protein engineering, mutagenesis, and screening to design
a new split-TurboID enzyme pair that becomes functional upon ligand binding to DRD1. Next, we will carry out
in vivo proteomic studies using both 1) a full-length TurboID tethered to the C-terminus of DRD1 (independent
from Aim 1, and 2) the DRD1 split-TurboID enzyme pair from Aim 1. As a proof of principle, we expect to
identify distinct, acute DRD1 interactomes that are present after acute versus prolonged exposure to cocaine,
and after withdrawal from prolonged exposure to cocaine. More broadly, this technology will enable the
unbiased identification of intracellular proteins that are recruited to DRD1 in response to substances that
modulate dopamine binding. These aims will establish new and transformative technologies for sensitive in
vivo proteomic tagging, and in the future can be used to identify mechanisms underlying SUDs along the
continuum of addiction."
10805186,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Skull base and face imaging accounts for nearly 20% of clinical neuroradiology examinations. But clinical MRI
of the skull base and face continues to rely primarily on conventional 2D T1-weighted and T2-weighted pulse
sequences and fat suppression techniques. These techniques generate suboptimal tissue contrasts with
suboptimal spatial resolution. The long acquisition times often lead to motion artifact. Contrast weightings and
rapid acquisitions tailored to the uniquely small structures of the skull base and face would expand the clinical
utility of MRI for diagnosing pathologies of these regions. Dr. Guenette’s goal for this four-year K08 mentored
career development award is to gain the skills needed to develop comprehensive skull base- and face-specific
MRI sequences and protocols that optimize clinically relevant contrast-to-noise and simultaneously acquire
relaxometry biomarkers that are co-registered to the anatomic images at the voxel level with markedly reduced
scan times compared with current standard-of-care skull base and face MR imaging. Dr. Guenette is a
neuroradiologist with skull base and face sub-specialization at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. His research
has included optimizing product pulse sequences for imaging skull base and face structures. The training
objectives and research activities of this proposal will provide Dr. Guenette with the mentorship, time, and
resources to learn and apply MRI physics, pulse sequence design, and image processing. The main research
expertise of Dr. Guenette’s mentor, Dr. Bruno Madore, an MRI physicist, lies in the development of novel
acquisition and image reconstruction strategies for MRI. The co-mentor, Dr. Ravi Uppaluri, is an
otolaryngology-head/neck surgeon physician-scientist with complementary clinical expertise. In Aim 1 Dr.
Guenette will: build a normative atlas of quantitative T2, T1, and relative proton density values of anatomic
structures in the skull base and face; use this atlas to generate and test theoretically optimal contrasts for
nerve imaging; establish normative T2, T1, and relative proton density values of head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors to generate and test optimal contrasts for visualizing and segmenting HNSCC
tumors; and test the biomarker potential of T2, T1, and relative proton density measures in HNSCC. In Aim 2
he will: develop a novel pulse sequence that incorporates scanner gradient strength as a parameter to further
decrease scan times and evaluate synthetic pulse sequences across 1.5T, 3T, and 7T field strengths. The
training and data will facilitate Dr. Guenette’s long-term goal to independently lead an NIH-funded laboratory
focused on developing and implementing more rapid qualitative MR anatomic imaging and quantitative MR
methods specifically tailored to the skull base, face, and neck structures and pathologies."
10808250,"Cholestatic liver diseases, including biliary atresia (BA), are the leading indication for pediatric liver transplant
and there are no effective medical therapies for patients that decrease the need for transplantation. This is due,
in part, to the lack of understanding of how the liver reacts to bile acid induced injury in children, including the
hepatocyte activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is a protective molecular response that
decreases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress which can occur in the setting of cholestasis, in part through
induction of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways. Our laboratory’s previously published and present
preliminary data using several models of ER stress demonstrate that young mice have inadequate UPR
activation (specifically within the XBP1 pathway) compared to adult mice, and this is associated with increased
liver injury. The same pattern of impaired XBP1 pathway activation occurs in explanted livers from pediatric
patients with cholestatic liver diseases compared to both normal and disease controls. The goal of my current
investigations is to increase the understanding of the pathophysiologic hepatic responses of the XBP1 pathway
to cholestatic liver injury and identify changes during postnatal development that influence UPR activation. This
will allow us to target specific UPR pathways for the development of novel treatments for pediatric cholestatic
liver diseases. Therefore, I have formulated the following Specific Aims: 1) To define age-dependent changes
in XBP1 transcription factor function using murine models of ER stress 2) To define the protective
mechanism of XBP1 regulation of ERAD in chronic cholestasis and 3) To determine the changes in
mechanism of XBP1 signaling which occur in murine and human biliary atresia (BA). Using murine models
of ER stress and cholestasis and human liver tissue from BA patients we will identify the mechanism of XBP1
specific pathway changes that occur during post-natal development, and how these changes influence disease
progression in response to cholestasis-induced ER stress. Candidate and Career Development: I am a
pediatric hepatologist at Northwestern University who has a demonstrated commitment to basic/translational
research throughout my early career. My long-term career goal is to become an independent, extramurally
funded physician-scientist with a focus on the hepatocellular UPR response in pediatric cholestatic liver
diseases. This K08 proposal will help achieve this goal by advancing my scientific skills and knowledge in gene
regulation, cellular signaling pathway analysis and high-throughput data analysis, as well as defining the role of
the unfolded protein response in murine cholestatic liver disease models and correlative human diseases. Along
with my co-mentors, Drs. Green and Barish, I have developed a career development plan to achieve these goals
through didactic lectures, mentoring, and hands-on laboratory training. This proposal will provide the protected
time and research training for future R01-level proposals extending mechanistic XBP1 pathway studies within
pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and investigating UPR-related therapeutics."
10796912,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic wounds present a costly social and medical dilemma, particularly in patients with type II diabetes, but
there are no effective treatments. These wounds are characterized by chronic inflammation, severe
microvascular complications, and therefore lack expansion of the granulation tissue and proliferation necessary
to heal the wound. Recently, exosome administration has emerged as a potent therapy for promoting wound
healing but the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect are mostly unknown. Exosomes are secreted
membranous nanovesicles that can be isolated from cell culture of multipotent stromal cells. In a preclinical type
II diabetic model, a single local administration of exosomes was very effective and reduced time to closure to
nearly that of wild type mice. We found extensive neovascularization in granulation tissue of exosome-treated
wounds and presence of large numbers of macrophages immunoreactive for arginase1, typically indicative of a
pro-healing phenotype. Exosomes from multipotent stromal cells carry plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)
among other angiogenesis-associated proteins. When we applied a PAI-1 inhibitor simultaneously with
exosomes, the beneficial effect of exosome treatment was partially mitigated. Exosomes can have multiple
signaling pathway targets, and PAI-1 is a major component. Our long term objective is to understand the
molecular mechanisms we need to address to alter the chronic wound state, and actually promote wound
closure. An approach like this is necessary to understand the rationale and safety of exosome treatment.
 In this study, we are investigating the hypothesis that PAI-1 in bone marrow MPSC exosomes mediates
adaptive effects on macrophages and ECs in chronic wound beds, thereby promoting expansion of granulation
tissue with effective changes in wound healing trajectory. In Aim 1, we will determine whether overexpression or
loss of PAI-1 in exosomes affects the typically delayed diabetic wound healing. We will assess spatiotemporal
distribution of macrophages and endothelial cells. In Aim 2, we will analyze the changes in wound bed
macrophages and endothelial cells at a single cell resolution, using an integrated epitope and transcriptomics
approach. Additionally, in in vitro culture with inflammatory conditions, we will determine molecular changes in
macrophages and microvascular endothelial cells, downstream of exosome uptake. The results will demonstrate
the mechanisms orchestrating the efficacy of exosome treatment in normalizing inflammation and promoting
diabetic wound closure. We will perform the study under the mentorship of Dr. Bruce Cronstein, Dr. Ann Marie
Schmidt, and Dr. Thorsten Kirsch, and gain expertise in modeling chronic diseases in preclinical study designs,
hyper-inflammatory disease states, macrophage assays, and exosome-mediated mechanisms and cellular
communication in a chronic cutaneous wound bed. The collaborative and scientific learning environment at NYU
will provide the optimal setting to gain expertise in rational design of evidence-based translational research. This
training period will provide the scientific and career development rubric for an independent career in research."
10796913,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The current COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionately affecting Black and Latino individuals and increasing
existing health disparities. These racial/ethnic populations are facing magnified stress and lack access to patient-
oriented health services. Thus, utilization of Digital Health Platforms (DHP) has the potential to address reach,
delivery, effectiveness, scalability, and sustainability to decrease COVID-19 related stress in these populations.
 The proposed study builds on our previous DHP, the Biofeedback Assisted Resilience Training (BART), that
targeted improving physiological metrics of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as a measure of autonomic regulation
to manage stress in service members. Now, we incorporate UNC Health patient portal (UNCH- PHRs),
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program tailored for COVID-related stress, wearable heart rate sensor,
and mobile health app (mHealth) to collect physiological and psychological scales of mental health, into our DHP
model to deliver a culturally sensitive Stress Management Intervention Leveraging Electronic health records
(SMILE).
 The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate effectiveness and sustainability of our DHP model, to
delineate mindfulness-related mechanisms of action by measuring changes in psychological self-reported
metrics and autonomic balance using HRV, and to examine associations between COVID-19 related stress and
mental health outcomes, resilience, and HRV. Understanding these interrelationships with a focus on
racial/ethnic groups is of utmost importance to provide personalized treatment. The central hypothesis is that
SMILE will mitigate COVID-19 related stress. We will test our central hypothesis with a 3-arm randomized
controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) an internet-delivered, instructor-
administered Mindfulness-Based Stress Management training (MTIA), 2) self-administered Mindfulness training
through the commercially available mHealth app Headspace (MAPP), or 3) Waitlist control (WLC). The DHP will
capture progress at various points of the study (baseline, weekly during the 08 weeks and at 3-months follow-
up). Our rationale is that our DHP model enables access to a wide range of populations, facilitating the promotion
and delivery of targeted DHP interventions, such as mindfulness, while collecting psychophysiological metrics to
assess treatment efficacy and predictors of mental health. The broader impact is that our proposed DHP could
be used to assess new treatment effects and increase health equity for racial/ethnic populations."

The Western States Node's (WSN) research agenda for the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials
Network (CTN) competing renewal tests interventions to fill gaps in the Addiction Care Cascade, where
progressively fewer people with drug use engage in treatment, receive pharmacotherapy, are retained in care,
and experience sustained recovery. The Node proposes to continue the successful partnership between
Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU; Todd Korthuis, MPI) and University of California San Francisco
(UCSF; James Sorensen, Co-I), and adds Stanford University/Palo Alto VA (Keith Humphreys, MPI) to the
collaboration. Six diverse health systems participate in WSN: 1) OCHIN, 2) The Palo Alto VA and national
Veterans Healthcare Administration, 3) The OHSU health system, 4) Stanford Hospital and Clinics, 5)
ProtoCall Services, Inc., and 6) Health Share and Trillium Medicaid managed care organizations. The WSN
tests novel interventions that expand access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
The overarching goal of the WSN's competing renewal application is to conduct collaborative research within
the CTN that fills gaps in the Addiction Care Cascade and thereby enhances the lives of people living with
drug use disorders. Our Addiction Care Cascade-focused research agenda developed through conversations
with diverse investigators and stakeholders including people who use drugs. Two research themes
(medication trials and hybrid implementation trials to close gaps in the Addiction Care Cascade) provide four
examples of CTN studies that could help close treatment gaps. In Research Theme 1 (medication trials),
Medication Trial 1 targets people with OUD who are not interested in currently available MOUD and
randomizes them to receive long acting oral hydromorphone versus facilitated referral methadone or
buprenorphine to improve engagement and retention in treatment. Medication Trial 2 is a multisite phase 3
trial of mirtazapine versus placebo for people with methamphetamine use disorder to reduce
methamphetamine use. In Research Theme 2 (hybrid implementation trials), two trials compare strategies to
enhance engagement and retention on MOUD. Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Trial 1 is a cluster-
randomized trial of telephonic + mHealth behavioral support services to improve retention on buprenorphine in
primary care. Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Trial 2 tests a telementoring peer support intervention
versus weekly peer supervision to improve peer success in engaging and retaining people who use drugs in
treatment. We suffuse this research agenda with the Node's infrastructure and expertise in vulnerable
populations, health systems, electronic health records research, data science and clinical trials management.
WSN offers these resources to the CTN network for use in future CTN protocols. Finally, WSN continues to
use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications."
10796917,"Extending imaging depth is one of the grand challenges in optical microscopy, and many creative approaches
are under development to mitigate the detrimental impact of the phenomenon of ‘optical scattering’ and enable
deeper optical imaging in scattering media. Light propagating in dense tissue undergoes scattering events that
scramble the phase of the propagating optical wavefront, and thus disrupts the constructive interference needed
to focus/spatially localize the light to a diffraction-limited focal spot. Consequently, microscopic resolution is
typically only available in the so-called ‘single-scattering’ (SS) or ‘ballistic’ light regime. OCT is one of the leading
modalities in the field of deep microscopy, with maximum imaging depths typically 1–2 mm in scattering tissues.
However, the incredible success of OCT has in some ways led to lower motivation than in other optical imaging
fields to develop new approaches to address the problem of multiple scattering (MS). This is also a great
opportunity – by building upon its already deep imaging capabilities, OCT has the opportunity to once again be
at the forefront of research on pushing the imaging depth limits of optical microscopy. We propose an integrated
approach that combines (1) long-wavelength OCT (1700 nm window, lower scattering coefficient supporting
deeper imaging), (2) spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) in the conjugate imaging configuration to enhance the
deep OCT signal by 2-3 orders of magnitude relative to the standard imaging configuration, (3) hardware
adaptive optics (HAO) to correct tissue-induced aberrations and thereby boost the ballistic signal deep within
tissue, and (4) aberration-diverse OCT (AD-OCT) for suppressing MS. Our recently-developed AD-OCT
approach combines the advantages of a fiber-based OCT system with the principle behind the highly promising
coherent accumulation of single scattering (CASS) method. The CASS method coherently accumulates SS from
multiple illumination angles (plane wave illumination in full-field imaging geometry), whereas AD-OCT coherently
accumulates SS arising from illuminating the sample with different known aberration states, and leveraging
computational adaptive optics (CAO) to circumvent the resolution penalty normally associated with these
aberrations. Aim 1 will develop a method to overcome the aberration-diversity saturation limit, implement high-
speed GPU-based processing to address the Big Data problem in AD-OCT, and enable real-time feedback at
the time of imaging. Aim 2 will quantitatively compare the performance of Gaussian-beam OCT (with and without
HAO correction of tissue aberrations) vs. AD-OCT (with HAO correction of tissue aberrations). This will include
measurements of the depth-dependent 3D point-spread-function, which will also fill an important knowledge gap
in fundamental research on MS in OCT. Aim 3 will demonstrate AD-OCT beyond the current OCT multiple
scattering limit in human skin and mouse brain in vivo (we will ‘unlock’ the 2-5 mm depth range). If successful,
this proposal will demonstrate the deepest OCT imaging ever performed in human skin and mouse brain, and
so is significant from the perspective of fundamental imaging science and the biomedical applications of OCT."
10797763,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Local regional
therapies, such as local ablation and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), are the most commonly used
treatment modality for HCC. Following treatment, patients undergo radiologic imaging for evaluation of treatment
response. Assessing treatment response to local regional therapies is often challenging due to treatment-related
nonspecific changes and definitive assessment typically requires repeated cross-sectional imaging. Similarly,
there is poor radiologic-histological correlation of post-treatment tumor viability, with discordant results seen in
38% of HCC patients after local regional therapies. While serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) can aid to assess
treatment response, less than half of all patients with HCC have an elevated AFP before treatment. This limits
its utility for broader implementation.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are phospholipid bilayer-enclosed particles released by both normal and tumor cells.
Compared to other types of liquid biopsy, EVs have advantages in their higher frequency in circulation and the
simplicity of sample preservation. One major challenge of this approach, however, is that tumor-derived EVs
typically co-exist with those from non-tumor sources, resulting in complex background signals. To overcome this
technical barrier for selective purification of tumor-derived EVs, our joint research team developed a novel
nanotechnology platform named EV Click Chip with the support of NIH/NCI R01 funding (R01 CA253651). When
used in combination with reverse-transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR), this HCC EV Digital Scoring
Assay (EV Click Chip + RT-ddPCR) is able to purify HCC EVs and quantify HCC-specific mRNA signatures from
the purified HCC EVs. We recently showed this assay can distinguish early-stage HCC from liver cirrhosis with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.93. Given the potential of HCC EV Digital
Scoring Assay for reflecting the presence of HCC and tumor burden, we hypothesized it could be used for
evaluating treatment response in HCC patients receiving locoregional therapies. The study aims of this two-year
R01 revision application are to investigate the performance of HCC EV Digital Scoring Assay (EV Click Chip +
RT-ddPCR) for evaluation of HCC treatment response to local ablation or TACE."

 Promoting recovery of motor function in stroke is an essential medical and economic target. Despite significant
advances in activity- and technology-based interventions, the field still fails to achieve the same level of recovery
in all patients. This failure could be due to the delay in administering massed practice training until patients gain
significant volitional movement, which can be weeks after stroke. Maladaptive plasticity could occur during this
time and challenges the therapeutic effect of rehabilitation interventions. Exoskeleton Walking Robots (ERs) can
provide assistance during walking training, and allow administering high dosage training early-on after stroke
The primary hypothesis of this proposal is that the earlier the commence of high-dosage gait therapy, the better
is the chance of inducing plasticity and recovery. In aim 1, investigators propose to compare the effect of
progressive, long duration (30 hours over 10 weeks), ER assist-as-needed walking training (ERASSIST) versus
standard of care (SOC) administered during the acute phase of a stroke on functional recovery and
neuromuscular activation. Participants will be randomly assigned to each group, and investigators will examine
the effect of each intervention on functional recovery and modulation of neuromuscular activations during
walking. They hypothesize that early administration of intensive walking training using ER assistance can lead
to significant increase in dosage, and a renormalization in walking function and neuromuscular activation during
walking. In aim 2, investigators will acquire longitudinal measures of structural and resting-state functional MRI
connectivity at 4 time-points: within 1 month of stroke, before and after 10 weeks of ERASSIST or SOC intervention,
and at 6 months post stroke. Data will be used to model prognoses of recovery and compare the effect of ERASSIST
and SOC interventions on improving the prognosis of recovery. In aim 3, investigators propose to study
reorganization in cortico-muscular connectivity (CMC) post-stroke and over the course of functional recovery
and compare it to gender- and age-matched healthy controls. Static CMC will be evaluated using transcranial
magnetic stimulation to record ipsilesional primary motor cortex excitability and recruitment curve slope. Dynamic
CMC will be explored using mobile imaging (EEG) and wireless EMG techniques to measure cortico-muscular
coherence during walking. The objective of comparing stroke and healthy controls CMC data is to understand if
the reorganization of CMC is an adaptation to stroke or a re-normalization to a healthy pattern of connectivity.
Investigators assume that participants with high functional recovery will show a re-normalization of CMC toward
more similarity with age- and gender-matched healthy controls. This research will have a significant impact on
“determining optimal combination and “dosing” of individual interventions to improve, and possibly accelerate
recovery following injury” by “examining the underpinnings of plasticity, adaptation, and response to injury and
rehabilitation intervention.”"

and completely. Since AML is a highly heterogeneous disease caused by multiple mutations, we propose that
a common, targetable feature among AML cases is that they are directly and indirectly influenced by cytokines
secreted in the bone marrow microenvironment. Our long-term goal is to identify novel drug targets to
selectively eradicate malignant clones that may impact the response to AML therapies. Our immediate goals
are to comprehensively determine the molecular mechanisms by which inflammatory pathways promote clonal
evolution in AML. We found that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is elevated in a diverse
set of AML patients, both encourages AML cells to multiply and simultaneously impedes normal cell growth.
Blocking communication between AML cells and IL-1 inhibits these effects and reduces survival of AML cells
while sparing healthy progenitors. Because cells from a majority of AML patients with different genetic
subtypes are dependent on IL-1 signaling for their survival, we predict that a large percentage of AML patients
might benefit from drugs targeting this pathway. However, direct targeting of IL-1 signaling may impact cellular
functions in healthy cells. We therefore focused our study on defining the IL-1-mediated molecular differences
between AML and healthy progenitors. Gene expression analysis identified that IL-1 upregulates ASF1B and
MARCKS in AML compared to healthy progenitors. ASF1B and MARCKS regulate cell proliferation, DNA
damage response, and inflammation in AML. Our data shows that genetic and pharmacological targeting of
ASF1B and MARCKS pathways suppresses AML growth. These findings suggest a number of important new
research directions. In the proposed project, we will test the hypothesis that differential activation of ASF1B
and MARCKS by IL-1β in AML versus healthy progenitors provides a competitive advantage to leukemic cells,
which ultimately leads to AML progression. Specifically, we will determine: (1) the in vitro mechanisms by
which IL-1 activation of ASF1B and MARCKS promotes the growth of AML cells; (2) the roles of ASF1B and
MARCKS in conferring IL-1-mediated growth advantage and driving AML progression in vivo; and (3) the
validity of ASF1B and MARCKS as therapeutic targets in AML using available small-molecule inhibitors. To
achieve our goals we established a variety of tools including 4 new transgenic mouse models and access to
TLK and MARCKS inhibitor through collaborations with world-renowned leaders. Determining the underlying
molecular mechanisms by which IL-1 supports AML development will pave the way to designing new treatment
strategies."

Excessive drinking is a major problem in the United States, particularly among coastal
communities surrounding the Gulf of Mexico, where nearly one in four residents screen positive
for alcohol misuse. Stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated response policies
(e.g., stay-at-home orders, closure of schools and businesses) may have increased alcohol misuse
particularly for those disproportionately affected by the pandemic and job loss, like racial/ethnic
minorities and women. This proposal addresses the NIAAA priorities described in NOT-AA-20-
011, helping to lay groundwork for public health emergencies such as COVID-19. We plan to
examine patterns and predictors of change in alcohol consumption in vulnerable Gulf Coast
communities over the course of the pandemic, including as vaccines and new variants emerge and
unemployment persists. Prospective studies are rare in disaster research, but the proposed study
will address this gap by collecting two new waves of survey data from an existing, population
representative cohort of 2,520 Gulf Coast residents we have been following since 2016 via the
Survey of Trauma, Resilience, and Opportunity in Neighborhoods in the Gulf (STRONG). The new
work will build on extensive baseline data about mental health, alcohol misuse, employment
history, disaster exposure, and social resources. The proposed work also builds on our team's
productive line of longitudinal studies of alcohol misuse, including studies examining
interactions between individual- and community-level risk factors, the role of stress and trauma,
co-occurrence of mental health symptoms, and psychosocial reactions to risks and disasters in the
Gulf Coast region. Two factors unique to COVID-19 are massive increases in unemployment and
growing feelings of loneliness caused by stay-at-home orders, both of which might change people's
drinking behavior. Through two new survey waves we will: estimate the magnitude of changes in
frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption following the onset of COVID-19; examine
trajectories of change in alcohol misuse within individuals; identify pre-COVID-19 predictors of
patterns of change (e.g., demographic characteristics, cumulative trauma exposure, co-occurring
mental health symptoms); and determine whether COVID-19-related losses (i.e., unemployment,
loneliness) predict change in alcohol use over time. Existing and new data will be mergeable via a
common respondent identifiers and also be geocoded, providing a unique resource for public
health research and response. Results from this study could significantly advance scientific
knowledge and clinical practice for vulnerable Gulf Coast residents."

 Virtually every cancer that takes the life of a patient is due to innate or acquired chemoresistance. This
is especially true in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), in which most tumors are initially sensitive to platinum-based
chemotherapy, but most will recur and succumb to chemoresistant disease. To achieve durable cures we must
understand the molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance. Through in-depth analysis of multiple models of
matched pre- and post-chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) ovarian cancers from treated patients, patient-
derived xenografts (PDX), and resistant cell lines, we have discovered and validated that chemoresistant tumors
have significant upregulation of the ribosomal biogenesis pathway. We have further examined efficacy of two
inhibitors of RNA Polymerase I (Pol I), the primary regulator of rRNA production. These agents, CX-5461 and
BMH-21, have significant (but frequently variable) activity against ovarian cancer cell lines and PDX models of
all histologies, and in many cases is even more effective in chemoresistant models. CX-5461 is currently in a
phase I trial, but we are the first to demonstrate and explore the particular susceptibility of chemoresistant cells
to targeting ribosomal biogenesis, and why this process might be key to developing chemoresistance. Several
questions remain unanswered, including whether targeting Pol I can kill the post-chemo microscopic remaining
population to achieve durable cures; how upregulation of ribosomal machinery enhances chemoresistance; what
transcriptome is activated by chemotherapy; whether the effects are specific to paclitaxel, carboplatin, or the
combination; and whether the hypothesized critical role of TP53 in the efficacy of these agents can allow
strategies to allow targeting Pol I to be even more effective. The overall objectives of this proposal are to
understand how upregulation of ribosome biogenesis allows cancer cells to survive chemotherapy, identify the
most effective setting in which to target Pol I as a therapy, and identify the best agents to use in combination
with Pol I for therapeutic synergy. To achieve these objectives, we will investigate in greater detail the
chemotherapy-induced differences in ribosome synthesis between the chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell
populations using multiple models, and identify how these differences are mediating Pol I inhibitor sensitivity.
Chemoresistant PDX models will be used to determine if Pol I targeting can prevent recurrence, or enhance
carbo/paclitaxel efficacy. We will investigate the differences between chemosensitive and chemoresistant cells
at the level of chromatin structure, occupancy of rRNA DNA transcription sites, and ribosomal organization. We
will utilize a 7,000-gene CRISPR library of druggable targets to identify candidate drugs to use in combination
with targeting Pol I. If the role of ribosomal biogenesis in chemoresistant cells can be better understood, it could
open the door to an entirely new approach to treating many cancers, and focus on the most deadly aspect of
cancer – evolution to a chemoresistant phenotype for which there is no cure."

Susceptibility to diverse immune diseases has been associated with genetic differences that affect
gene expression. Understanding the mechanisms by which these genetic differences lead to disease
has been a central goal of genomic efforts aimed at describing disease mechanisms and identifying
targets for therapeutic treatments. While large-scale studies have identified thousands of genetic
differences associated with immune diseases, in most cases, it is not known which variants are
causal and which are non-causal passenger variants. This is a considerable problem for the many
variants that exists in non-coding regions of the genome for which function is difficult to predict. Thus,
there is a critical need for the high-throughput experimental approaches to characterize the function
and mechanism of the many non-coding variants associated with immune diseases. To tackle this
challenge, we will use two complementary high-throughput approaches to study the impact of genetic
variants on immune gene expression. We will use MPRAs (Massively Parallel Reporter Assays) to
study the impact of genetic variants on gene expression. We will use our recently developed
CASCADE (Comprehensive Assessment of Complex Assembly at DNA Elements) approach, in
conjunction with mass spectrometry-based studies, to profile the impact of genetic variants on TF-
cofactor complex binding. We will use these approaches to characterize (1) the impact of genetic
variants on ~30 immune gene regulatory elements, and (2) ~5000 genetic variants found to be
associated with immune disease or altered gene expression. Combining these approaches will
address both function and biophysical mechanism of genetic variants in a cell- and stimulus-specific
manner. Furthermore, as many regulatory cofactors can be inhibited with drugs, characterizing TF-
cofactor complexes bound at genetic variants provides an opportunity to identify therapeutics to
counteract their effects. Altogether, by integrating complementary, high-throughput approaches that
directly account for effects of cell type and cell stimulation, the proposed studies will identify the
mechanisms by which non-coding variants affect gene expression and immune diseases.
Furthermore, these studies will lay a foundation for translating large-scale genetic studies into
therapeutic approaches to treat for immune diseases."

Therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). PDACs have an increased reliance on the DNA damage response
(DDR) for mitigating oncogene-induced replication stress and, the DDR regulates innate immunity via regulation
of cGAS/STING/TBK1-mediated detection of cancer DNA. ATM is the apical kinase in the DDR and the target
of small molecule inhibitors in clinical development. Furthermore, ionizing radiation stimulates the
cGAS/STING/TBK1 innate immune pathway to modulate immune responses in a type 1 interferon (T1IFN)-
dependent fashion that are required for the synergy of radiation with ICB. Therefore, the central hypothesis
of this proposal is that a novel direct link between ATM and innate immune sensing pathways can be
leveraged therapeutically in combination with radiation to enhance the tumoral T1IFN pathway and
improve ICB efficacy in otherwise poorly immunogenic PDACs. This hypothesis will be tested in three
specific aims: Aim 1 will define the immunologic consequences of ATM inhibition in combination with
radiation and the mechanisms by which ATM affects innate immunity in PDAC. In this aim we will assess
the contributions of cytoplasmic DNA (1A), ATM substrates (1B), and pattern recognition receptor pathway
signaling (1C) to immune endpoints such as T1IFN-mediated signaling, PD-L1 expression, and T cell-mediated
killing (1D). Aim 2 will investigate the immune contribution to the sensitivity of ATM depleted PDAC
tumors to the combination of radiation and PD-L1 therapy. Our preliminary data suggest that ATM has both
tumor and host immune-dependent mechanisms (i.e. T1IFN secretion) that influence the sensitivity of tumors to
combined anti-PD-L1 and radiation. We will determine the contribution of tumoral and host T1IFN signaling to
the sensitivity of ATM-deficient tumors to combined anti-PD-L1 and radiation therapy (2A) as well as the immune
consequences (2B). We hypothesize that the therapeutic advantages of ATM deficiency will be diminished in
T1IFNR deficient tumor cells and hosts since tumoral T1IFN production likely increases tumor
immunosurveillance through both tumor and host-dependent mechanisms. In Aim 3 we will develop a
therapeutic strategy combining ATM inhibitors and radiation with anti-PD-L1 in PDAC. Our preliminary
data show that pharmacologic ATM inhibition activates the immune pathway. We will determine the efficacy of
the clinical candidate ATM inhibitor AZD0156 in combination with anti-PD-L1 and the optimal radiation
dose/fractionation schema in syngeneic PDAC tumors and autochthonous PDAC tumors in genetically
engineered mouse models (3A). We will also develop pharmacodynamic biomarkers that will be predictive of the
therapeutic efficacy of ATM inhibition and radiation in combination with anti-PD-L1 (3B). Completion of these
aims will define a new connection between ATM, radiation and innate immunity that will be leveraged
therapeutically to extend the efficacy of ICB to PDAC which is highly relevant to the mission of the NIH."
10796879,"Cocaine use disorder (CUD) can cause vascular disease mainly through chronic vasoconstriction effects.
Atherosclerosis can be present in the carotid artery (CA) even without overt clinical symptoms. Once symptoms are
observable, the artery is usually damaged and cerebral ischemia can ensue, a common fatal outcome in CUD.
Indeed, while there are postmortem studies documenting arterial disease in individuals with CUD (iCUD), studies for
early in-vivo detection lag behind with catastrophic consequences. Here we will leverage the significant advances
made in imaging for early detection of atherosclerosis in asymptomatic populations who are nevertheless at
increased risk for vascular disease by MPI Fayad; such early detection is crucial for guiding prevention efforts.
Specifically, we will use a hybrid scanner whereby positron emission tomography (PET) with the radiotracer 18F-
fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) quantifies vessel-wall inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques while magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) with a 3-dimensional (3D) dark-blood scan characterizes carotid plaque burden. Such
simultaneous state-of-the-art previously validated PET/MRI CA imaging has never before been applied for early
atherosclerosis detection in asymptomatic drug addicted individuals. Targeting this population for early detection is
of particular urgency now that the “Crack generation” (of the mid 80s) is aging. Following decades of cocaine and
comorbid tobacco and alcohol use, these iCUD are at an especially high risk for vascular disease and
atherosclerosis. Nevertheless, given factors inherent to drug addiction, relevant diagnoses in this population are only
made when it is too late to intervene (hence the preponderance of post-mortem studies). We hypothesize that
markers of CA atherosclerosis will be detected in asymptomatic iCUD, as related to their cocaine, tobacco, and
alcohol use, at levels comparable, or even surpassing, those detected in individuals with known risk factors for
cardiovascular disease but without CUD. The bilateral internal CAs are the primary conduits of oxygenated blood to
the cerebral hemispheres and indeed individuals with cardiovascular disease demonstrate cognitive decline
(especially of attention, memory and executive function), recently suggested to be modulated by brain network
connectivity (especially in brain networks innervated by the internal CAs and subserving salience/control and reward
processing) as measured by resting-state functional MRI. Following a series of studies conducted by MPIs Alia-Klein
and Goldstein, where similar resting-state inefficiencies were reported in iCUD, modulated by severity of drug use
and accompanied by similar cognitive dysfunction, here we postulate that the CA disease markers in iCUD will
correlate with neural network connectivity and cognitive function. Beyond the mechanistic inventiveness of this
proposal, linking of the carotid to brain function for the first time in drug addiction, it also addresses a public health
imperative for early detection of the preclinical markers of atherosclerosis in iCUD. Once pathology is identified, and
especially if identified at an early stage, timely intervention can prevent the progression into emergencies,
impairments and premature mortality that comprise an enormous cost to society."

Huntington’s disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disease to which no pharmacological interventions are
yet available to cure the disease. HD is caused by a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene consisting of an
expanded CAG repeat. The age at which HD patients develop symptoms is considerably variable and although
the length of the pathogenic CAG repeat correlates with age of onset, individuals with equal repeat length
develop symptoms various decades after the average age of onset. This observation suggests that there are
other factors beyond the CAG repeat length that can modify the development of HD symptoms, providing
additional alternatives for the development of interventions to delay disease onset. Interestingly, genes involved
in DNA repair have been identified as potential genetic modifiers that influence age of onset. One such candidate
is APE1, the major mammalian apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease associated with the repair of mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) damage, which we have shown to be a precipitating event leading to mt dysfunction, loss of motor
function and neurodegeneration in HD. The expanded CAG repeat is somatically unstable and occurs during the
process of repairing oxidative DNA damage. We and others have elucidated important details for APE1 and
mutant HTT (mHTT) that localize to mt and reduces mt function in HD, yet our knowledge of how APE1 may
contribute to the late onset in HD patients, remains incomplete. We propose that, by preventing mtDNA damage
and somatic expansion, APE1 may be a genetic modifier that contributes to slowing HD age of onset. To test
our hypothesis, we will study if APE1 repair activity is implicated in somatic expansion and age of onset by
contributing to oxidative DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. The proposed research is particularly
relevant to human health, as it will deliver an unprecedented view of APE1 and mutant HTT mechanistic functions
underlying HD age of onset and add the regulation of APE1 as a mechanism for future drug discovery in HD."

This project will develop new technology for high-resolution soft-tissue MRI immediately adjacent to orthopaedic
metallic implants, an area that is “invisible” to current imaging techniques. We will leverage a novel high-
performance 0.55 Tesla MRI platform and will develop new software and tools that are optimized for this platform
and application. Finally, we evaluate the new metal MRI technology in two patient cohorts where it can
immediately impact patient management: hip replacement and spinal fixation. Rationale: Orthopaedic metal
implants are used extensively to treat late-stage osteoarthritis (total joint replacements), degenerative disc
disease (spinal fixations), and fracture stabilization following trauma or bone resection. These implants fail in
10%-40% of cases, and accurate non-invasive imaging with soft-tissue contrast is essential for the evaluation of
the underlying cause of hardware failure, and in surgical decision making and planning. At present, there is a
major unmet need for high quality soft tissue imaging immediately adjacent to the metal surface to assess, for
example, adverse local tissue response or nerve root impingement. State-of-the-art multi-spectral imaging (MSI)
led to major improvements ~10 years ago, and the technology has plateaued. Innovation: We leverage a novel
0.55T MRI system that will soon be commercially available, which alone promises reduced image artifacts,
because it provides much stronger imaging gradients relative to the susceptibility-induced gradients and field
shifts, higher-bandwidth RF pulses, uniform RF transmission, and new opportunities for improved encoding and
reconstruction. We also propose reimagined MSI pulse sequences to offer further improvements in signal-to-
noise ratio, encoding time, and artifact. Approach: Our specific aims are: 1) to adapt standard metal MSI
approaches for the 0.55T MRI platform to primarily assess the improvement of the 0.55T system alone due to
reduced off-resonance; 2) to redesign improved metal MSI approaches that leverage the gradient-to-B0 and RF
performance of the 0.55T MRI platform to compensate for lost SNR efficiency, while improving spatial resolution
and artifact suppression and offering fat/water separation; and 3) to compare 0.55T MRI and 3T MRI protocols
in patients with hip and spine implants, both to assess the improvement from the system alone and from
redesigned MSI sequences. Broader Impact: This project aims to demonstrate improved capability to image
closer to implant surfaces than what is possible at conventional 1.5T and 3T field strengths, and the impact in
the context of post-surgical evaluation of hip-replacements and spinal fixations. This will broadly benefit the use
of MRI in patients with metal, including orthopedic and non-orthopedic implants."

Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic syndrome that predisposes patients to tumor formation and is often diagnosed during infancy. Brain lesions, including subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) and cortical tubers, occur in ~20% of TSC patients and remain challenging to manage as there is extreme phenotypic heterogeneity. In order to better understand and surveil which patients are likely to develop severe brain lesions and associated treatment-resistant epilepsy, this project aims to understand the genotype-phenotype relationships of TSC. I hypothesize that the severity of tumor burden in TSC patients is associated with (and can be predicted by) mutations in specific genetic modifiers. I aim to (1) characterize genetic modifiers that associate with SEGA and cortical tubers and (2) establish biological consequences of mutations in DNA damage repair genes that we have identified in patients with TSC. The research and training plans here are designed to expose me to translational and clinical research studies, analysis of patient -omics data, implementation of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, use of two- and three-dimensional human cell models, and metabolic profiling. These skills and the training I receive in this career phase will be essential for my future career as an independent researcher."

This is a highly interdisciplinary research proposal to study the effects of aging on the responsiveness of
osteocytes to mechanical loading in both sexes of mice. The proposal will engage undergraduate and graduate
students alongside established investigators who will mentor these students in various aspects of bone
mechanobiology, computer-based modeling to build in silico models of how osteocytes respond to load and 3D
printing of osteocyte-lacuna-dendrite-canalicular models. The osteocytes with their interconnected dendritic
network are thought to be the primary mechanosensory cells in bone. Aging produces changes in morphological
aspects of the lacunar canalicular system. The long-term goal of this proposal is to determine how mechanical
strain and fluid flow shear stress induce the biological activation (mechanotransduction) of bone forming
pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, in osteocytes. Activation of this signaling pathway will be used to
correlate with the mechanics that induce the cellular response. This will be done using sophisticated finite
element (FE) and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modeling, using confocal imaging, at the level of the osteocyte
and its dendritic membranes using real data generated from loaded and unloaded bones as input into the models.
The specific aims are to a) Develop multiplexed imaging models to predict osteocyte activation in response to
altered mechanical loads encountered with aging, b) Develop macro and micro level 3D finite element and fluid-
structure interaction models of osteocyte lacunae and determine the strains and shear stresses on
osteocytes/dendrites as a function of age, at three different load levels and c) Correlate mechanical strain
determined by in silico modeling to Wnt/β-catenin signaling for different load levels. Male and female TOPGAL
(β-catenin reporter) mice at 6 and 18 months of age will be used. Activation of β-catenin signaling in osteocytes
in the ulna in response to loading will be determined using novel multiplexed confocal imaging approaches to
build multi-length-scale finite element models to study the loading response. From the 3D finite element and
fluid-structure interaction models, strain fields in the lacuna and wall shear stress will be determined. Mechanical
strain responses from in silico modeling will be correlated with the activation of osteocyte β-catenin signaling
determined using confocal imaging in each of the osteocyte/dendrite systems (β-galactosidase activity) to
determine a strain threshold for pathway activation. Fluid flow shear stress responses on the cell/dendrites will
be studied using FSI models and magnitudes at the activation levels. Novel 3D printed models of the lacuna-
canaliculi system will be used to study the overall flow of fluids through the system. The interdisciplinary research
team, from the fields of bone biology and engineering, will train engineering and health science students in a
collaborative team giving valuable experience to methods of working in diverse fields to research a scientific
problem."

A fundamental question in human development is how and to what extent parents shape the behavior of their
children. Current perspectives on the intergenerational transmission of substance use and disorder have been
greatly influenced by longstanding socialization theories of parental modeling and problematic parenting. At the
same time, substance use and disorder are heritable and substance using parents also pass genetic liability to
use substances to their children. Identifying causal mechanisms of intergenerational transmission is critical to
develop and implement effective preventive–intervention efforts, but observational studies of nuclear families
and parent–child dyads fully confound socialization and genetic influences. Effects of parental substance use
within families are particularly salient now, in the context of rapid shifts in marijuana legality, availability, and
acceptability. We will examine the intergenerational impact of parental marijuana use using two complementary
natural experiments — the children of twins design and a comparison of two states with markedly different
marijuana laws — in 6,457 parents and adolescents from 1,902 families in Colorado and Minnesota. Twin
parents are participants in the Colorado–Minnesota Marijuana Study (DA042755), a collaboration between two
genetically informative, longitudinal twin studies with parallel, multi-wave, longitudinal measures that are
conducted in two states with marked differences in current marijuana legality and availability. We now intend to
recruit and twins’ adolescent children, and nontwin parents/caregivers, to evaluate parent–child transmission of
marijuana use and disorder. The following specific aims will be addressed: (1) Differentiate mechanisms of
parent–child transmission of marijuana use and disorder using an innovative children of twins design; (2)
Determine effects of marijuana legalization on parents, families, and adolescents by comparing parental
and adolescent marijuana use, parenting practices, and the family environment in two states with markedly
different marijuana laws; and (3) Delineate effects of behavioral disinhibition in the context of marijuana
legalization, testing the hypothesis that parents and adolescents with greater disinhibition will use marijuana
at higher rates and/or with more problems in Colorado. Leveraging these uniquely informative, complementary
study designs, as well as the comprehensive longitudinal data already collected in these twin samples, we will
be able to answer important questions about the intergenerational transmission of substance use in a rapidly
changing landscape —legalized recreational marijuana — with critical implications for prevention and
intervention efforts and public policy."

Halting and reversing upward secular trends in body weight in the US is an important medical and public health
challenge. Additional skilled researchers in obesity prevention are much needed, but training programs are
few. Obesity is a complex disorder that has multiple causes and multiple potential strategies for prevention and
treatment. The present proposal is a competitive renewal application for a training grant called the Minnesota
Obesity Prevention Training (MnOPT) program. Originally funded in 2010, its goal is to provide multidisciplinary
training for a new generation of obesity prevention scientists. MnOPT has successfully recruited 23 trainees
over the last eight years from a large pool of highly qualified applicants, 13 post docs and 10 pre-docs, all of
whom have been matched with appropriate preceptors and all of whom have been productive. We have also
conducted a successful educational program with interdisciplinary training for all fellows in biological
mechanisms and clinical and public health interventions as well as training in ethical conduct of research. We
have directed each of the fellows to educational experiences, e.g., research design and analysis, as
individually appropriate. We are proposing only minor changes to this successful program in this renewal.
Because of the size and composition of the applicant pool, we are requesting one additional postdoc training
slot to the six already approved. Robert Jeffery will remain the overall director, as well as director of the
epidemiology/behavioral track, and Catherine Kotz, professor in the Department of Integrative Biology and
Physiology, will serve as co-director and director of the basic science/clinical track. The research base at the
University of Minnesota remains strong. The number of participating faculty has decreased from 36 in the
original application to 33 in the current renewal to include only those with documented mentoring experience
and the strongest research base. The institutional support for the training program has also strengthened since
the initial proposal."

Children in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are burdened by significant unmet mental health needs. A recent
systematic review estimated that 1 in 7 children in SSA struggle with a serious mental health issue. The World
Health Organization estimates prevalence rates may be even higher (20%). Across SSA, high rates of poverty,
HIV/AIDS, food insecurity, stigma and an inadequate health safety net system exacerbate serious childhood
behavioral health (CBH) needs and impede an effective response. Disruptive behavioral disorders (DBDs) are
particularly concerning as they persist through adolescence and adulthood. DBDs are also highly related to poor
physical health and interpersonal challenges in adulthood. Hence, addressing the context-specific social
influences on CBH is critical given that children in SSA comprise more than half of the total regional population.
If children’s needs are to be met in SSA, then: 1) implementing interventions designed and tested in SSA, and
which mobilize resources within existing child-focused institutions is critical; 2) combined interventions that
simultaneously target SSA-specific influences on CBH and can be delivered in collaboration with child/family-
serving community settings are necessary; and 3) group, community and population approaches to CBH are
needed to drive scalable solutions. Guided by Social Action, Asset, and Family Systems theories, the proposed
study will examine the mechanisms by which EE and FS interventions targeting social, familial and context-
specific drivers affect the mental health of 900 Ugandan children in mid-upper primary school (10 to 14 years).
The study uses an experimental, longitudinal design across 30 cluster randomized primary schools to compare
single and combination intervention options; influences of EE and FS on economic, perceptual and functioning
mediators; and context-specific moderators. The three study conditions are: 1) EE only, 2) MFG-based FS only,
3) combined EE+MFG-based FS. The interventions will be provided for 12 months; and assessments will occur
at baseline, 12, 24 and 36 months. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Examine the impact of EE only, MFG-based
FS only, and combined EE+MFG-based FS on children’s DBD symptoms and behavioral functioning; Aim 2:
Test the influence of EE only, MFG-based FS only, and combined EE+MFG-based FS on family financial stability
(e.g., food and housing stability, material assets, savings), parenting and protective family processes (e.g., family
organization, caregiver/child interaction, cohesion, support) and perceptions related to help seeking (e.g.,
stigma) on CBH and functioning; and assess whether these change mechanism mediate intervention effects on
DBD symptoms and behavioral functioning, and explore moderation by context-specific moderators of
intervention effects; and Aim 3: Qualitatively examine participants’ experiences with each intervention arm. The
investigative team will leverage their long-term partnerships in SSA to maximize the public health impact of the
research findings and to shorten the time gap from new knowledge to system and population-level improvement."

 Evidence from our lab and others finds that an individual's sensitivity to alcohol in emerging
adulthood predicts future alcohol-related problems. Although sensitivity has been hypothesized to relate to
alcohol tolerance, few studies have adequately evaluated that relationship. In addition, our prior research has
identified the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (LHPA) stress axis, which
interact with the brain's reward circuit, as a potential sex-sensitive functional brain network associated with a
person's low level of response (LR) to alcohol. Until now, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based
associations with LR have analyzed brain regional alcohol effects in a segregated manner and did not consider
the functional connectivity (FC) between the PFC-LHPA network and sex differences in these brain circuits.
 The goals of this proposal are to conduct a series of post-hoc secondary analyses, two pilot feasibility
trials, and a full human laboratory study that combines neuroendocrine and ethanol-fMRI approaches to probe
the PFC-LHPA network through a lens focused on LR, alcohol's stimulating effects, the development of acute
tolerance, and potential sex differences. We hypothesize that low LR to alcohol will be correlated with
decreased FC between the PFC-LHPA network and that disrupted FC will be greater in women than men.
 To test this hypothesis, in the R21 phase we will reanalyze fMRI data from an existing data set wherein
low- and high-LR women and men completed an alcohol challenge followed by an ethanol/placebo-fMRI
emotional processing task. We will also explore potential sex differences and the relations among LR to
alcohol with: 1) acute tolerance measured previously in the lab, and 2) the subsequent development of chronic
tolerance measured longitudinally in two unique existing data sets. Finally, we will conduct two pilot feasibility
studies in 12 low- and high-LR women and men that will serve as Go / No-Go decision points for the R33
phase: 1) examine subjective and objective alcohol sensitivity measures and acute tolerance to a higher dose
of alcohol; and 2) examine alcohol's effects on brain activation and connectivity patterns following emotional-
and stress-processing fMRI tasks that stimulate different components of the PFC-LHPA network.
 In the R33 phase, we will conduct a new set of experiments combining a higher-dose ethanol
neuroendocrine challenge piloted in the R21 phase followed by the ethanol/placebo-fMRI procedure piloted
previously in 60 young, moderate drinking, non-alcohol dependent women and men. That experiment will allow
us to test whether low- (N = 30) and high-LR (N = 30) women (50%) and men differ in their stress hormone
response to a binge-like drinking episode, and how those alcohol sensitivity and stress hormone responses
correlate with functional connectivity in the PFC-LHPA network. Data will also be gathered to evaluate
alcohol's stimulating, hedonic, ataxic effects and acute tolerance as measured by changes in endocrine and
PFC-LHPA measures at rising versus falling breath alcohol concentrations between low- and high-LR subjects."

Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) research represents a major national investment. ADRD
clinical research faces delays and risks to internal and external validity resulting from challenges to efficient
accrual, especially inadequate inclusion of populations at increased risk for disease due to social determinants

potentially eligible individuals who have consented to be contacted about studies, reducing the need for serial
recruitment by enabling bolus enrollment of ready cohorts. Few data address essential questions about registry
design, conduct, and effectiveness in aiding ADRD research recruitment. How best to recruit and retain
participants to registries and whether registries can address the urgent need to diversify clinical research
samples are unknown. Furthermore, how registry samples compare to other research populations has not been
investigated. This proposal investigates traditional and modern approaches to registry recruitment and asks
critical questions about inclusion of participants from underserved neighborhoods and registrant retention. Given
that registries are, by definition, convenience samples, we also aim to quantify the bias associated with these
recruitment tools and develop methodology for addressing this bias. This project will produce essential
information about resource utilization in recruitment registries and provide critical guidance for the field about
how best to use these important tools."

Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are currently considered as one of the
leading causes of dementing illness. The key feature of VCID is diffuse white mater lesions (WML) and
hippocampal damage, including myelin loss, axonal disruption, and astrogliosis. However, the underlying
molecular and cellular mechanisms for WML, hippocampal damage, and cognitive impairment are not well
understood. Hypertension and atherosclerosis are the most significant risk factors for dementia epidemics. Using
two mouse models of VCID with chronic bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS), we detected progressive
activation of the WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 protein complex in white matter tracts and hippocampus, which is
associated with brain lesion and cognitive deficits. Brain Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1) contributes
to intracellular Na+ and Cl- overload, cytotoxic edema, and excitotoxic ischemic neuronal damage. The serine-
threonine WNK kinase family [with no lysine (K)], and its downstream kinase SPAK (the STE20/SPS1-related
proline/alanine-rich kinase) activate NKCC1 activity via protein phosphorylation. In our pilot study, we detected
that BCAS triggered a time-dependent activation of the SPAK-NKCC1 protein complex, specifically in corpus
collosum (CC) and hippocampal GFAP+ reactive astrocytes. How the WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 protein complex is
stimulated and its role in the pathogenesis of BCAS-induced WML and hippocampal lesion remains unknown.
We detected BCAS-induced elevation of interleukin-18 receptor 1 (IL-18R1) expression and nuclear
translocation of pNF-κB in GFAP+ reactive astrocytes, which are correlated with increased NF-kB recruitment on
the Wnk/Spak/Nkcc1 gene promoters. Importantly, blocking SPAK function with a novel, selective SPAK inhibitor
ZT-1a significantly reduced WML, hippocampal CA1 region neurodegeneration, and attenuated cognitive
function impairment. Therefore, we propose that activation of the WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 complex plays an
important role in the BCAS-induced pathogenesis. We hypothesize that (1) BCAS-induced hypoperfusion
stimulates the IL-18/IL-18R-MyD88-NF-κB cascade to upregulate the WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 complex in reactive
astrocytes; (2) elevated astrocytic WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 signaling and astrogliosis contribute to cell death of
oligodendrocytes (OLs), demyelination, CA1 neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits; and (3) Post-BCAS
administration of the novel SPAK kinase inhibitor ZT-1a reduces brain lesions and cognitive deficits by
attenuating astrogliosis and degeneration of OLs and CA1 neurons. These hypotheses will be tested in the
following specific aims:
Aim 1. Identify molecular mechanisms that stimulate WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 cascade activation and astrogliosis in
white matter tracts and hippocampus after BCAS.
Aim 2. Determine causative roles of BCAS-induced astrocytic WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 cascade activation in brain
lesion and cognitive function impairment.
Aim 3. Investigate the efficacy of the novel SPAK inhibitor ZT-1a in reducing astrogliosis, brain lesion, and
cognitive function impairment in the BCAS mice."

Newborn health has improved globally but there remains a critical need in resource-limited settings to reduce
neonatal mortality. Nearly all infant deaths in sub-Saharan Africa occur in babies that are small or low
birthweight, which often result from antenatal infections with Plasmodium falciparum. These malaria effects can
be partially mitigated by pregnancy-specific measures including the administration of monthly antenatal doses
of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine as intermittent preventive therapy during pregnancy (IPTp-SP), but these are not
typically implemented until the 2nd trimester, and so do not mitigate the risks of infection in the 1st trimester. It
is now feasible to include 1st trimester screening for malaria parasites owing to: i) updated WHO guidelines that
recommend an expended schedule of 8 ANC contacts, with the first prior to 12 weeks gestation, ii) the
availability of high-sensitivity malaria rapid diagnostic tests (HS-RDT) with enhanced detection of low-density
infections, and iii) accumulated safety data that enable the use of Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) for malaria
treatment in the 1st trimester. We hypothesize that, compared to women who enter ANC and receive usual
care, women who are screened in the 1st trimester with an HS-RDT will have a lower prevalence of a poor
pregnancy outcome, and we will test this through the Improving Neonatal health Through Rapid malaria testing
in Early Pregnancy with high-sensitivity Diagnostics (INTREPiD) study in Western Kenya and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC). In Aim 1, the INTREPiD study will enroll women in the 1st trimester and
randomize them 1:1 to usual care or to screening with an HS-RDT followed by treatment of positives with AL,
and then follow them through delivery. Following the 1st trimester intervention, all women will receive usual
ANC, including IPTp-SP. The primary outcome will be the composite outcome of low birthweight, small-for-
gestational age, preterm birth, fetal loss, or neonatal death. In Aim 2, we will measure the therapeutic efficacy
and pharmacokinetics of AL administration in the 1st trimester through a population PK study following standard
AL dosing and compare PK parameters with historical controls. In Aim 3, we will use trial data to model the
potential incremental benefits of enhanced-sensitivity diagnostics and alternate treatment regimens on the risk
of an adverse pregnancy outcome in order to maximize the impact of our trial data. Collectively these data will
guide the development and implementation of fresh approaches to intercept parasites early in pregnancy and
thereby enhance pregnancy outcomes and newborn health."

Project Summary
The strategic objectives of our NRSA Training Core (TL1), which support the workforce development goals
of our CTSA hub, are to provide “predoctoral students orientation to translational science and postdoctoral
appointees advanced research training aligned with CTSA goals of advancing therapeutics (drugs, devices,
and preventatives), clinical interventions, and behavioral modifications to improve health”. These objectives are
being met by engaging trainees from diverse biomedical disciplines in an innovative, competency-based training
program, centered on the authentic clinical and translational (C&T) research practices of our Multidisciplinary
Translational Teams (MTTs). Existing curricula and training programs in the biomedical sciences at UTMB, as
elsewhere, excel at developing an individual’s discipline-specific knowledge and technical skills, but are less adept
at developing the core competencies needed to effectively participate in the interprofessional, multidisciplinary
team-based research environment critical to translate scientific discoveries into improvements in human health.
To address this gap, our Specific Aim is to produce highly skilled researchers who possess both an integrated
knowledge of the human diseases that underlie their C&T research and learner-level appropriate competency in
team management, leadership, conflict resolution and negotiations, interprofessional communication, stakeholder
engagement, entrepreneurship, and the regulatory/ethical issues associated with human-subjects research
and clinical trials. Since our program’s inception, trainees have engaged in a competency-based curriculum
using the latest pedagogical approaches, active learning modalities, and authentic experiences. Our current
TL1 curriculum includes: 1) the Interprofessional Translational Research Design (ITRD) Course, 2) a Team
Leadership Workshop for predocs; 3) the Clinical Encounters course, and 4) dissertation/postdoctoral research
projects co-mentored by both scientific and clinical experts. For this renewal application, we introduce several
new training initiatives including: new courses in medical-/bio-informatics and machine learning, team science
(e.g., TeamMAPPS) and community-engaged research, a bench-to-global health policy Vaccinology Track, and
new opportunities for training in entrepreneurship. Training will continue to be personalize through reiterative use
of the Individual Development Plan (IDP) by our trainees and mentors. In addition to tracking NCATS common
metrics, the outcomes of our training on learner competency across multiple C&T research domains will be
assessed using a robust set of rubrics and validated assessment tools. Results will continue to be disseminated
to the education and research communities through, on-line course materials, publications, presentations and
workshops. The need for well-trained C&T researchers with the knowledge and skills needed to advance new
scientific discoveries into improvements in human health has never been greater. With further support from NIH/
NCATS for 6 full-time training slots (4 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral) and 10 short-term positions annually, we
will continue to prepare the biomedical workforce needed to solve the health care challenges of the 21st century.

Autophagy is frequently upregulated in cancer cells under metabolic stress to recycle
cellular components for protein and ATP synthesis to promote cell survival. Based on its
important roles in maintaining cell viability and inducing resistance to radiation and
chemotherapy, inhibition of autophagy has become a viable therapeutic approach that has
been evaluated in clinical trials. However, there is a need to identify predictive biomarkers
to enable selection of patients that may best respond to autophagy inhibitors. Our
preliminary data demonstrates that the mTORC1 regulator REDD1 controls sensitivity to
autophagy inhibition suggesting that cancers with significant REDD1 levels, such as renal
cell carcinoma (RCC), are hypervulnerable to this therapeutic approach. Our major goal
is to investigate the mechanisms that control sensitivity to autophagy inhibition in RCC
cells to optimize its potential clinical application. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of
REDD1 as a regulator of RCC pathogenesis and sensitivity to autophagy inhibition. In Aim
2, we will investigate the mechanistic link between PIM1 inhibition and upregulation of
REDD1 with a focus on endoplasmic reticular stress. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the impact
of clinically-relevant autophagy inhibitor-based combinations for RCC therapy."

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are mediators of and
therapeutic targets for diverse disorders, including chronic pain. This proposal challenges the
dogmas that these receptors signal primarily from the plasma membrane and that cell surface
receptors are the optimal therapeutic targets. Completed studies revealed that GPCR endosomal
signaling controls pain and that endosomally-targeted antagonists provide more effective
analgesia than conventional drugs. The renewal application extends these concepts to
tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), a RTK for nerve growth factor (NGF). Although successful
for the treatment of pain, NGF monoclonal antibodies have not been approved due to adverse
outcomes of systemic antagonism. A deeper understanding of how NGF and TrkA signal pain is
required. Anatomical and electrophysiological studies with mouse and human nociceptors,
behavioral studies in mice, biophysical assays using recombinant proteins, model cells and
nociceptors, and nanoparticle-encapsulated antagonists will be used to study NGF pain. Aim 1
hypothesizes that neuropilin 1 (NRP1) is required for NGF-induced sensitization of nociceptors
and NGF-evoked nociception. Preliminary studies suggest that NRP1 and the scaffolding protein
GAIP/RGS19-interacting protein (GIPC1) are necessary for NGF-induced nociception. Co-
expression of TrkA, NRP1 and GIPC1 protein and mRNA in mouse and human nociceptors will
be studied. Inhibitors of NRP1 and GIPC1 will be used to ascertain their contributions to NGF-
induced sensitization of nociceptors and nociception. Aim 2 hypothesizes that NRP1 acts as an
NGF coreceptor and TrkA chaperone to enhance NGF signaling of pain in nociceptors.
Biophysical approaches will be used to study NGF association with NRP1, assembly of
TrkA/NRP1 heteromers, TrkA surface expression, and NGF signaling in subcellular
compartments of nociceptors. The role of GIPC1 as a scaffold for TrkA and NRP1 association will
be studied. Aim 3 hypothesizes that endocytosis and endosomal NGF/TrkA/NRP1 signaling in
nociceptors mediates sustained sensitization and nociception. The contribution of endocytosis to
NGF-induced nociception will be studied using inhibitors of endocytosis and NGF/TrkA/NRP1
antagonists encapsulated into nanoparticles designed to deliver cargo to endosomes of
nociceptors. NGF-induced endocytosis of TrkA/NRP1, compartmentalized signaling, nociceptor
sensitization and nociception will be studied. A deep understanding of TrkA trafficking-dependent
signaling will provide insights into the mechanisms and treatment of chronic pain, with implications
for other RTK-mediated pathologies (e.g., cancer)."

In neuronal circuits, the relationship between gene expression and long-range neuronal projections
defines the structure of circuits and constrains computational models of their functions. In the past few
years, systematic studies on the gene expression and projections of cortical neurons across the whole
cortex have revealed tremendous diversity in cell types defined by gene expression, i.e. transcriptomic
types, and in long-range projections. These previous studies have laid the foundation for understanding
the complex relationship among gene expression, projections, and cortical areas at cellular resolution.
Unraveling this relationship, however, is challenging, because it requires associating gene expression and
projections across large areas of the cortex at cellular resolution. Furthermore, gene expression that are
associated with the development of projections may be transiently expressed in development. Here we
overcome these challenges by applying two high-throughput in situ sequencing-based neuroanatomical
approaches, BARseq and retro-BARseq, to comprehensively interrogate both gene expression and
projections in the cortex. These techniques rely on in situ sequencing of RNA barcodes to determine the
projections of thousands of neurons together at cellular resolution. Because these techniques use in situ
sequencing, they can also simultaneously interrogate the expression of hundreds of genes in the same
cells. Thus, the highly multiplexed nature and the ability to associate projections with gene expression in
the same cells make BARseq and retro-BARseq uniquely suited for unraveling how gene expression
associate with projections. We will combine these high-throughput techniques with robust meta-analysis to
take advantage of existing systematic single-cell RNAseq datasets in the cortex to identify association
between gene expression and projections with unprecedented details. We will focus on the corticothalamic
circuit because its projections are highly diverse and organized across both cortical areas and
transcriptomic types. We will start by building a whole-cortex to whole-thalamus projection map of
transcriptomic types. We will match transcriptomic types in our data to cell types in reference
transcriptomic datasets to broaden our impact. We will then focus on a portion of the cortex encompassing
multiple neighboring cortical areas to identify gene correlates of projections within the same transcriptomic
types across neighboring areas. Finally, we will apply the same approach to the developing brain to
assess the developmental association between gene expression and projections. The datasets generated
in this study will not only provide a foundational resource that enables future structural and functional
studies at the cell type resolution, but also provide a unique view of the relationship between cellular
programs encoded by gene expression and wiring diagrams encoded by projections."
10804115,"Children born in the context of poverty have 10 years lower life expectancy and an increased likelihood of having
compromised health and development, highlighting the urgent need for effective interventions to reduce health
disparities. Supportive perinatal interventions reduce health risk disparities rooted in early experience, but to
evaluate interventions’ effects on offspring development, researchers must either wait years for health outcomes
to emerge in offspring, or use high-cost, labor intensive assessments such as MRI. Causal evidence of perinatal
interventions’ effects on a biological level could provide mechanistic insight into interventions’ influence,
contributing non-invasive, proximal indicators to evaluate, compare, and refine interventions for specific
populations. However, existing studies on perinatal biological embedding are based primarily on observational
data and do not provide the requisite experimental leverage for causal inference. The proposed project
capitalizes on a randomized trial of an evidence-based perinatal intervention, the Nurse Family Partnership
(NFP) to a) experimentally test the hypothesis of perinatal biological embedding via the mechanism of DNA
methylation (DNAm) in offspring and b) identify non-invasive biological indicators that could be used to evaluate
perinatal interventions’ early effects on child development. Studies in rodents causally implicate DNAm in in the
biological embedding of perinatal adversity. Novel potential biomarkers of perinatal biological embedding in
humans include 1) a cross-tissue DNAm signature of glucocorticoid (GC) exposure, developed using
hippocampal progenitor cells, and validated using neonatal blood samples and 2) the Pediatric Buccal Epigenetic
clock (PedBE), derived from buccal cells, which provides a measure of epigenetic aging, which is associated
with compromised infant brain growth and neurodevelopment. Leveraging these two methodological advances
and a new funded trial of the NFP, we will implement minimally-invasive buccal cell biosampling from 446 infants
born to pregnant individuals (>50% Black), participating in the NFP trial (n=223 randomized to receive the NFP,
n=223 control) at baseline and 24 months. We will generate DNAm biomarkers across infancy and paired genetic
data using low pass whole genome sequencing. We propose that maternal NFP participation, versus care as
usual, will alter the biological embedding of perinatal adversity, as reflected by DNAm biomarkers of GC exposure
and pediatric epigenetic aging over infancy, which will correlate with infant development at 24 months. Aim 1:
Test whether the NFP causes variation in DNAm at GC-sensitive sites in infants over the first two years of life.
Aim 2: Determine whether NFP causes differences in epigenetic age in infants over the first two years of life.
Aim 3: Identify DNAm signatures as predictors of infant development at 24 months of age. The results would
provide causal evidence for perinatal biological embedding of supportive intervention via DNAm, and contribute
to direct, proximal indicators of perinatal interventions’ salutary effects against developmental risk in the context
of adversity. This would refine intervention evaluation and inform policy decisions to redress health inequities."

This project is designed to develop a new approach to monitor and predict treatment response in patients with
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) using hyperpolarized (HP) 13C pyruvate MR molecular imaging. PDA
is among the deadliest cancers and is anticipated to become the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related death in the
US by 2030. Most PDA patients present with nonresectable disease where systemic therapy is the only life-
prolonging treatment. In the minority of patients (~30%) who present with localized, potentially resectable disease,
neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) followed by surgery is an emerging approach to improve patient survival but is only
beneficial if the selected NAT is effective. For all PDA patients, effective systemic therapy is the single most
important factor influencing their survival. However, current response assessment tools, including MRI, CT, and
the serum tumor marker CA19-9 provide poor early assessment of response in patients with rapidly lethal
advanced PDA, and are suboptimal for selecting patients most likely to benefit from a highly morbid surgery after
NAT. Therefore, there is a critical unmet need for more timely and accurate indicators of therapy response in
PDA to 1) promptly discontinue ineffective treatments and switch to alternative treatments with potentially better
efficacy, and 2) better guide clinical decisions regarding surgery following NAT. Metabolic reprogramming
towards increased glycolysis is a hallmark of PDA. In particular, the over-expression of lactate dehydrogenase
A and monocarboxylate transporter 1 and 4 results in high levels of pyruvate conversion to lactate, which plays
a central role in PDA progression and therapy resistance. Such reprogrammed glycolytic metabolism can be
noninvasively interrogated using HP 13C pyruvate MRI, an emerging molecular imaging method that provides
dynamic and pathway-specific metabolic information not available with current imaging methods including
[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Our preliminary patient studies demonstrate
reprogrammed glycolytic metabolism in PDA using HP 13C pyruvate MRI, with increased conversion to lactate
and reduced conversion to alanine in tumors compared to normal pancreas. Our preliminary results also suggest
that early metabolic changes measured by HP 13C pyruvate MRI can predict tumor response to therapy. Building
on these exciting results, we propose to investigate for the first time the value of HP 13C pyruvate MRI for therapy
response monitoring in PDA patients. In Aim 1, we will develop and refine HP 13C pyruvate MRI acquisition, post-
processing, and analysis strategies optimized for PDA metabolic evaluation. In Aim 2, we will monitor early
therapy response using this imaging approach in patients with advanced/nonresectable PDA. In Aim 3, we will
determine whether HP 13C pyruvate MRI can predict response to NAT through correlation with pathologic
response in patients with resected PDA. Successful completion of this project will provide the first data on HP
13C pyruvate metabolism of PDA in response to therapy, with the overarching goal of better guiding clinical
decision making to improve survival for patients with this deadly disease."

Improved point-of-care tests and diagnostic algorithms for tuberculosis (TB) are urgently needed to enable more
timely and accurate diagnosis. Currently, lack of diagnosis and diagnostic delays are significant contributors to
increased mortality [1,2,3] in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), due to reliance on insensitive, slow
and/or locally inappropriate tests and limited access to optimal diagnostic modalities. Fortunately, rapid advances
in diagnostic imaging technology have produced affordable, portable, point-of-care ultrasound devices that can
be transported with exceptional ease to resource-limited settings. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is now regularly used
to accurately diagnose a variety of pulmonary disorders including pneumonia and pulmonary edema. Our
preliminary studies have demonstrated 96% sensitivity of LUS for detecting associated sonographic
abnormalities in patients with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).5 However, there remain
barriers to implementing LUS for TB diagnosis, including a scarcity of robust data about ideal training and
scanning procedures. Our overall goal is implementation of real-time AI-facilitated LUS for timely evaluation of
people with TB-suspected symptoms to triage who needs further evaluation and testing. Our preliminary data
suggest LUS may be highly sensitive for the diagnosis of PTB, but no rigorous, adequately powered studies
have investigated lung ultrasound findings in patients with PTB versus controls without PTB. To address these
critical information gaps, we aim to:
Aim 1. Develop a LUS model for PTB detection as a triage tool for PTB diagnosis which can be used in
field settings in low-resource and remote areas. Hypothesis: LUS will have similar or better sensitivity for
diagnosis of PTB compared to CXR with moderate (i.e., 70-80%) specificity when interpreted by trained
personnel and validated by experts.
Aim 2. Develop and test an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for detecting PTB by LUS that does not
require trained personnel for use in LMICs. Hypothesis: An AI algorithm based on convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) will classify LUS features indicative of PTB with high sensitivity (90)% vs. the reference
standard of microbiological testing.
This study will leverage resources and expertise among partners in the United States and Peru. Our
multidisciplinary research team at the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH), the Peruvian NGO A.B.
PRISMA, and the Johns Hopkins University have a strong track record of collaborative work in novel research
projects in resource-poor settings, including TB and LUS. The use of portable AI-augmented LUS could save
lives in resource-limited settings by decreasing time to case detection and treatment initiation."
10804010,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mental health disorders are the leading cause of disability in the U.S., affecting approximately 1 in 5 people.
While the causes are likely multifactorial, hippocampal glutamatergic synapse formation and number are strongly
correlated with mental health outcomes. In utero environmental cues critically alter development of hippocampal
synapses. Over 30% of people in the US are obese and maternal obesity now affects more than 1 million
developing babies in the US annually. Children of obese mothers have a higher risk of anxiety, autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) and reduced cognition. In contrast, maternal exercise (ME) is associated with increased
cognition, emotional resilience, and reduced risk of ASD. The mechanisms underlying both the positive and
negative effects of maternal metabolic state on development are largely unknown. Insulin is a key metabolic
hormone that is upregulated with maternal obesity (MO); however, MO is associated with insulin resistance.
Interestingly, insulin sensitivity is restored by exercise in both MO mothers and offspring. However, critically we
do not know how MO, ME, and insulin affect hippocampal synapse formation. Our preliminary data show that
insulin increases glutamatergic synapse formation through induction of a novel factor called apelin. Moreover,
both insulin and apelin require FNDC5/irisin to promote the effects of BDNF on glutamate synapse formation.
BDNF is a classic neurotrophic factor whose levels rise during development at a critical time for glutamatergic
synaptogenesis. Disruptions in BDNF or its receptor, TrkB, in humans lead to impairments in both cognition and
emotionality. Here, our preliminary data shows that maternal obesity leads to a decrease in hippocampal
synapse formation in vivo. However, a critical gap in our knowledge is how maternal obesity causes this effect.
In contrast, we have found that maternal exercise increases hippocampal synapse formation. Our collaborators
showed that apelin is required for the beneficial effects of maternal exercise on metabolic function in their
offspring. However, while we have found apelin increases synapse formation in vivo, it is not known if it is
required to mediate the effects of exercise, or how this links to the effects of insulin. Our central hypothesis is
that insulin increases synapse formation in the developing hippocampus through the actions of apelin and irisin
to increase BDNF, and that this pathway is blunted by maternal obesity and increased by maternal exercise. We
will test this with the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine if insulin’s neurotrophic actions are mediated by apelin,
irisin and BDNF. 2. Determine if maternal obesity alters synaptic development by miss-regulating insulin, apelin,
irisin and BDNF signaling. 3. Determine if maternal exercise stimulates synaptic development and plasticity via
insulin and apelin regulating the expression of hippocampal BDNF. The rationale for the proposed research is
that understanding how insulin, MO and ME impact BDNF and glutamatergic synapse development, will allow
us to better predict the long-term consequences of different maternal environments and help direct behavioral
and therapeutic strategies to alleviate cognitive and emotional disorders."
10804091,"SUMMARY – Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD) is a rare genetic disease caused by
impaired γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission. Since SSADHD was first identified in 1983, research
has focused on identifying the spectrum of pathogenic ALDH5A1 mutations, understanding the molecular and
biochemical bases of disease presentation, and testing promising therapeutics. To date, however, there remain
significant knowledge gaps that are barriers to early detection and prognosis of the disease, and to the
assessment of the efficacy of novel promising therapeutics. These gaps include a comprehensive description of
the natural course of the clinical severity of the disease, an in-depth assessment of the neurophysiology of the
disease, and the prognostic value of biochemical markers. We began to address these knowledge gaps four
years ago with our currently funded natural history study (NHS) of SSADHD and have already demonstrated
significant correlations between age of the patients, severity of the disease, blood biomarkers, and
neurophysiological parameters. However, the 4-5 year span of the current study and varying age and clinical
severity of the study participants has mostly afforded a cross-sectional perspective on disease progression and
the prognostic value of biomarkers. In order to gain the longitudinal insight needed to assess the predictive power
of disease markers at study intake on prognosis, a longer follow-up of the participants is needed. The purpose
of this application is to extend this natural history study for five years. We propose the following aims: 1) to
determine patient-specific changes over time in the clinical severity of SSADHD, 2) to determine patient-specific
changes over time in neurophysiological markers known to be dependent on GABA homeostasis, and 3) to
determine patient-specific changes over time in biochemical markers known to be abnormal in SSADHD. To
accomplish these aims, the study will follow ~70 patients representing ~30% of all known cases worldwide. The
project will be led by research teams at three academic institutions and is supported by patient advocacy groups
and families from all over the world. The research will provide the clinical and biochemical information needed
to predict the natural course of the disease, monitor the success of future therapeutic trials, and provide a strong
rationale for adding SSADHD screening to existing NBS panels."

type 2 diabetes can reduce diabetes risk and improve cardiometabolic health. Sedentary screen time (SST) (i.e.,
television viewing, social media, and/or video streaming outside of work and educational pursuits) is ubiquitous
in American society with >80% of adults engaging in >3.5 hours/day. SST is predominantly done in the evening
(eSST), where it has been hypothesized that prolonged eSST may have the most harmful health effects due in
part to disruptions to glucose metabolism and sleep. Several existing interventions have successfully reduced
SST, including our mHealth-based StandUPTV intervention (R01CA239612, MPI: Keadle, Buman), but
intervention durations have been short (≤ 16 weeks) and no study has evaluated whether SST reductions are
maintained post-intervention which ultimately are needed to lower disease risk. Forming an automatic habit by
performing a new behavior after the same contextual cue is a promising strategy for behavioral maintenance.
One effective habit formation strategy, often called “action planning,” has fostered behavioral maintenance
across several domains (e.g., diet, physical activity, medication adherence, sleep, and smoking cessation). In
preliminary work by PI Stecher, performing mindfulness meditation after breakfast or coffee in the morning
increased daily meditation performance during an 8-week post-intervention maintenance period. However,
implementing action plans for maintaining eSST reduction requires remote and objective eSST monitoring
technologies that to date have not been available. Recently, our team has developed these technical capabilities
through our StandUPTV mHealth platform that uniquely enables us to develop and test an action planning
strategy for maintaining reductions in eSST. This study will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
effectiveness of action plans as a novel behavioral maintenance strategy in a (ORBIT Model) Phase II trial among
48 nationally-recruited adults at-risk for diabetes. Participants will be randomized to one of two mHealth study
arms: (a) StandUPTV only (an evidence-based mHealth intervention to reduce SST inclusive of self-monitoring,
education, and 50% reduction in SST target); or (b) StandUPTV + action plans for maintaining reductions in
eSST. Participants’ action plans will use an alert (i.e. mobile notification to disrupt prolonged eSST) to cue a
more active behavior (e.g.,10-min walk) and then receive a financial reward if the active behavior is successfully
performed. We will use mixed methods to assess the intervention’s feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
efficacy for maintaining reductions in eSST and improving cardiometabolic outcomes. This study will contribute
important new knowledge regarding evidence-based strategies to maintain behavior change, which can be
applied across health behaviors. This pilot study will help to refine an mHealth solution for reducing SST that
can be scaled through the use of several commercially available screen time monitoring tools and the necessary
information to scale-up the StandUPTV application into a Phase III, fully powered efficacy trial."

Sensory hair cells are required for balance function. Vestibular hair cell degeneration causes balance
dysfunction/hypofunction manifested as dizziness and vertigo. While the mammalian cochlea lacks the ability
to regenerate lost hair cells, a limited degree of spontaneous regeneration occurs in the utricle, a vestibular
organ detecting linear acceleration. Prior studies have shown that ATOH1 overexpression can enhance the
extent of hair cell regeneration, but these regenerated hair cells fail to fully mature. In preliminary experiments,
we have characterized hair cell degeneration and regeneration in the mature mouse utricle in vivo, and found
that transient, rather than constitutive, overexpression of ATOH1 promotes both hair cell regeneration and
maturation. The first aim of this proposal is to determine if transient ATOH1 overexpression increases hair cell
regeneration and maturation. Specifically, regenerated hair cells labeled via fate-mapping are probed via
histology and electrophysiology to assess bundle morphology, expression of bundle proteins,
mechanosensitvity, basolateral currents, and synaptic properties including vesicle release. To gain an
unbiased insight into the genetic signature of regenerated hair cells, we will use single cell RNA sequencing
technologies and bioinformatic approaches to delineate the transcriptomes of ATOH1-enhanced regenerated
hair cells and validate them histologically. In the second aim, we will test whether transient overexpression of
ATOH1 enhances regeneration and maturation of hair cells in human utricles in vitro. We will leverage our
established pipeline of human utricles from organ donors and vestibular schwannoma patients, where the latter
cohort shows hair cell degeneration, a low level of spontaneous hair cell regeneration and incomplete
maturation. Regenerated hair cells will be assessed histologically for bundle morphology, expression of bundle
and synaptic proteins and via single cell RNA sequencing to probe transcriptomes of ATOH1-enhanced
regenerated human hair cells. In summary, we will apply state-of-the art technologies (gene therapy, hair cell
physiology, single cell RNA-seq, bioinformatic strategies) to study vestibular hair cell regeneration in transgenic
mouse models and human utricles. We have assembled a team of experts who have worked together to collect
promising preliminary data. At the end of this 5-year proposal, we will have determined whether transient
ATOH1 overexpression can promote regeneration and maturation of mouse and human hair cells at the
histological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic levels."

 The neural mechanisms by which the hippocampus encodes social memory, the ability to recognize
and recall encounters with a conspecific, remain largely unexplored. As social dysfunction and social memory
impairment are associated with a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, a deeper understanding of the neural
bases of social memory is needed to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. Here, we focus on
the hippocampal CA2 region, as CA2 pyramidal neurons have recently been found to play a central role in
social memory in mice. Moreover, CA2 abnormalities have been identified in several human diseases and their
mouse models. Although progress has been made in defining the role of CA2 in a simple form of social
memory—the ability of a mouse to distinguish a novel from a familiar individual—a number of fundamental
questions remain. What social sensory information is encoded in CA2? How is social information relayed to
CA2 through its cortical-hippocampal inputs? Does CA2 participate in forms of social memory more complex
than social familiarity?
 Here we address such questions by examining neural representations of the most salient social cue for
mice, mouse urine, and how those representations are modified by odor-reward learning. We use 2-photon
calcium imaging in head-fixed mice to assess CA2 neuron responses to social and non-social odors in an
odor-reward learning paradigm in which a mouse is trained to associate one of two odors with a water reward.
We find that social-odor reward learning both requires CA2 and enhances the ability of CA2 pyramidal neuron
activity to distinguish between rewarded and unrewarded social odors. Although CA2 also distinguishes non-
social odors, non-social odor learning neither requires CA2 nor enhances CA2 non-social odor discrimination.
Thus, CA2 is specialized for the encoding of associations between a social stimulus and reward, and this
encoding is behaviorally relevant.
 Here we ask how social information is delivered to CA2 and whether odor classification and odor-
reward learning are computed locally in CA2 or inherited from CA2 inputs. We will address these questions
using optogenetic inhibition of the three major cortico-hippocampal inputs to CA2: entorhinal cortex, dentate
gyrus, and CA3. We will perform two-photon calcium imaging from these regions to examine and compare their
representations of social and non-social odors, before and after odor-reward learning, with our results in CA2.
Finally, we will use optogenetics and two photon imaging to characterize the odor representations and role in
odor learning of three distinct populations of CA2 inhibitory neurons that have been implicated in social
memory. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to provide the first detailed examination of how social
odors and odor-reward learning is processed through the cortico-hippocampal circuit to allow socially-relevant
experiences to be incorporated into social memory representations."

 As of February 8, 2023 more than 102.7 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to COVID-19 disease
have occurred in the United States. Besides the acute morbidity and mortality associated with hospitalization,
many patients with COVID-19 develop prolonged complications in the lung characterized by long term respiratory
symptoms and radiographic changes due to pulmonary fibrotic and inflammatory processes. Some reports
suggest 60-70% of patients who had severe COVID-19 infection will have residual pulmonary disease with
fibrosis and/or ground glass opacities on chest imaging consistent with persistent lung inflammation. What drives
the chronic immune and inflammatory response is unclear, but persistent viral antigen stimulation well after acute
infection has resolved has been described in many viral infections. Persistent immune stimulation can lead to
chronic inflammation through multiple mechanisms, including induction of innate immunity, chronic B and T cell
responses, and immunosenescence, a highly pro-inflammatory process due to repeated T cell stimulation. In
preliminary data we have extensively characterized the alveolar milieu in patients presenting with post COVID-
lung disease up to 2 years after being diagnosed with acute infection. We have identified three patterns based
on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) characteristics: a benign BAL pattern associated with stable lung scaring, a
neutrophilic BAL pattern associated with increased cytokine concentrations and pulmonary fibrotic changes, and
a lymphocytic pattern associated with increased chemokine concentrations and ground glass opacities on chest
imaging. Importantly, we describe persistence in BAL of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 85% of subjects and spike protein
in half the subjects we have studies do far. In this project we hypothesize that chronic lung disease after
COVID-19 infection is due to persistent viral proteins in the lung and a poor pulmonary immune response
to SARS-COV-2. To address this hypothesis we propose the following specific aims. (1) To obtain
bronchoalveolar lavage and peripheral blood for mechanistic studies on a cohort of patients who have
persistent lung disease after acute COVID infection, including repeat follow up bronchoscopies on a
subset of patients. (2) To further characterize BAL cellular and inflammatory patterns in patients with
post COVID lung disease and link them with clinical diagnoses. (3) To assess COVID specific pulmonary
humoral and cellular immune responses in patients with post COVID lung disease to determine linkages
between COVID specific immunity, failure to clear viral RNA and proteins, and subsequent pulmonary
disease. We have the capacity to recruit patients with post COVID lung disease who have BAL available for
study and perform detailed cellular, inflammatory mediator, and SARS-CoV-2 specific immune analysis to
explore potential mechanisms for the different pulmonary phenotypes seen. We feel the approaches utilized in
this study will provide valuable information on post COVID lung disease, suggest approaches to management
and treatment, and may be even be applicable to future studies on lung diseases after other viral infections."

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that disease states of either endocrine or exocrine pancreas aggravate
one another, which implies bi-directional blood flow between islets and exocrine cells. However, this is
inconsistent with the current model of uni-directional blood flow, which is strictly from islets to exocrine tissues,
termed insulo-acinar portal system. Furthermore, exocrine and endocrine compartments of the pancreas have
been studied by different scientific communities, and the diseases of them are treated by physicians in different
medical disciplines, gastroenterologists and endocrinologists, respectively. Notably, it is still unknown why
pancreatic islets, consisting only 1-2% of the pancreas, are embedded in the bulk exocrine tissue as one organ.
We have previously shown that islet microcirculation is integrated with that of surrounding exocrine tissue at its
entirety through intravital in vivo recordings of fluorescent-labeled red blood cell flow as well as in situ imaging
of pancreas vasculature using thick tissue blocks. This new model of the bi-directional blood flow physically links
both compartments. Further anatomical analysis of the spatial relationship between islets and blood vessels has
revealed that the majority of islets had no association with arterioles. Islets with a direct contact with an arteriole
are significantly larger, a pattern that has been observed throughout the examined mammalian species: human,
monkey, pig, rabbit, ferret, and mouse. We hypothesize that the arterioles emerge to feed the bulk exocrine
pancreas regionally with no preferential targeting of individual islets. Vascularizing the pancreas in this way may
allow an entire downstream region of islets and acinar cells to be simultaneously exposed to changes in the
blood levels of nutrients, hormones digestive enzymes and other circulating factors, which could underlie the
pathogenesis of pancreatic diseases including diabetes. In this application, this hypothesis will be tested by
modeling the pancreas blood flow crosstalk using in vivo models (Aim 1). In parallel, the characteristics of the
human pancreatic vascular network will be examined using our unique collection of the whole human pancreata
(currently n>210 spanning the lifetime from 7-days to 85 years of age) and specimens from the Network for
Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes (nPOD) (Aim 2). In this multi-disciplinary proposal, we have assembled
complementary expertise that widely cover all necessarily research fields to accomplish the propose projects:
endocrine and exocrine microcirculation, advanced animal surgery, vascular biology, endocrinology, diabetes,
beta-cell/islet physiology and biology, genetics, pathology, gastroenterology, pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer,
allogeneic and autologous islet transplantation, and immunology."

Tubular proteinuria resulting from impaired endocytic uptake of filtered proteins by the kidney
proximal tubule (PT) is a common feature of early kidney dysfunction that poses a significant risk
for development of end-stage renal disease. This proposal aims to understand the mechanistic
basis of Dent disease, a progressive genetic disorder characterized by tubular proteinuria that is
caused by mutations in the 2Cl-/H+ exchanger ClC-5. Enhanced degradation of megalin, a
multiligand co-receptor that binds to filtered proteins, is thought to underlie the tubular proteinuria in
Dent disease, however, the step in trafficking that is affected is unknown, and the contribution of pH
vs. Cl- homeostasis to the disease phenotype is disputed. We will utilize a combination of genetic,
morphological, mathematical modeling, and biochemical approaches to accomplish the following
aims: (1) identify the step(s) in membrane traffic that are impaired in ClC-5 knockdown PT cells; (2)
determine the molecular mechanism that links loss of ClC-5 to reduced megalin expression; and (3)
identify therapeutic targets for restoring megalin expression and function in a mouse model of Dent
disease."
10785430,"Dr. Nicholas Nassikas is a pulmonary and critical care physician whose long-term career goal is to determine
how climate-related exposures affect the respiratory health of people with chronic lung disease and to devise
strategies to prevent or mitigate such effects in the context of climate change. He has assembled a
multidisciplinary and multi-institutional mentorship team with expertise in environmental epidemiology (Drs.
Rice and Gold) and asthma disparities (Dr. Israel), who have demonstrated a firm commitment to his long-term
success as a clinical investigator. As part of the award, Dr. Nassikas will extend his skills in biostatistics,
epidemiology, and statistical programming through formal coursework to obtain a Master of Public Health.
Rates of global warming are doubling every decade, causing heavier precipitation and warmer, more variable
temperatures across the United States, with significant implications for human health. Dr. Nassikas’ study will
evaluate associations of temperature and precipitation, and the extremes of each, on the respiratory health of
those with chronic obstructive lung disease and in vulnerable populations, including Black/Latinx communities
who may be differentially exposed. His central hypothesis is that higher levels and variability of temperature
and precipitation will be associated with more respiratory symptoms and exacerbations, lower lung function,
and higher airway inflammation in adults with asthma and COPD. Dr. Nassikas will leverage three existing
well-characterized cohorts and recruit a prospective cohort of adults with asthma. He is well positioned to test
his hypotheses in the following aims: (1) Determine if monthly extreme weather events (high/extreme heat, high
wet-bulb globe temperature, heavy precipitation), temperature, and temperature variability are associated with
respiratory symptoms and events in adults with chronic obstructive lung disease, (2) Determine if short-term
differences in weather conditions are associated with lung function and airway inflammation in adults with
chronic obstructive lung disease, and (3) Determine if temperature, temperature variability, and precipitation
are associated with differences in symptoms and lung function in adults with asthma and, secondarily, to
evaluate if associations are mediated by exposure to mold and aeroallergens. There is a very strong working
history between the members of Dr. Nassikas’ mentorship team (Drs. Rice, Gold and Israel), who have
published over 27 peer-reviewed manuscripts together. The well-coordinated supervision of Dr. Nassikas’
research activities and career development by his mentorship team follows an existing successful mentorship
model. He will benefit from the outstanding and complementary environments at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center, Harvard School of Public Health, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the Harvard-NIEHS
Center. This proposal will provide valuable data and training in epidemiology and prospective study design and
execution, which will lead directly to future R01 applications and support his development as an independent,

Glioblastomas (GBMs) are malignant primary brain tumors in adults. Standard of care involves maximal safe
surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Novel therapies are also under
development for GBM patients. However, physicians are hampered in their efforts to effectively treat GBM
patients by their inability to reliably monitor tumor growth in vivo. Specifically, disease progression and
treatment response in GBM patients are typically monitored by non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) methods such as contrast-enhanced MRI. However, contrast enhancement reflects the integrity of the
blood brain barrier rather than any intrinsic biological activity of the tumor. As a result, it becomes difficult to
reliably determine response to therapy.
Tumors reprogram their metabolism to generate the biosynthetic precursors needed for proliferation.
Phosphatidylcholine is the main structural component of all cellular membranes, and its biosynthesis is
upregulated in most cancers due to the high membrane turnover associated with uncontrolled proliferation.
The dietary nutrient choline is converted to phosphocholine (PC), which is subsequently incorporated into
phosphatidylcholine. Expression of the key enzyme in this pathway, choline kinase α (CKα), is elevated in
tumors relative to surrounding normal tissues, including in GBMs. Non-invasive methods of imaging CKα
activity will provide the unique opportunity to visualize tumor intrinsic biological activity in vivo.
Deuterium magnetic resonance spectroscopy recently emerged as an innovative clinically translatable method
of imaging the metabolism of stable, non-radioactive, deuterated molecules in vivo. Our goal is to determine
whether mapping CKα activity using deuterated choline enables non-invasive assessment of GBM response
to therapy in vivo. We will examine the ability of deuterated choline to spatially map CKα activity (Aim 1) and
provide a readout of GBM response to therapy (Aim 2) in vivo at the clinical field strength of 3T. For both aims,
we will use complementary biochemical assays to confirm our DMRS data and correlate it with tumor biology.
Our proposal is innovative and impactful because it will validate deuterated choline as a specific, safe, non-
radioactive tracer for imaging GBM growth in vivo. By doing so, our proposal will enable precision imaging that
significantly improves outcomes and quality of life for GBM patients."

The long-term goal of this proposal is developed to uncover the molecular mechanisms and identify
critical regulators governing lymphatic vascular function in health and disease in hopes of offering
potential new therapeutic targets to combat cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. At the third year
of postdoctoral training, the PI has published his first postdoctoral project and presented his studies in
several prestigious conferences that pave the way for his transition to an independent investigator.
The lymphatic system is responsible for maintaining interstitial fluid homeostasis, immune cell
trafficking and lipid absorption. Lymphatic function participates largely in the pathogenesis of metabolic
and cardiovascular diseases such as obesity and atherosclerosis. How lymphatic dysfunction leads to
abnormal lipid transport and fat deposition, and conversely, how these metabolic diseases impair
lymphatic function are poorly understood but highly medically relevant questions. Embryonic mice
lacking Foxc2, a key transcription factor, prevents the formation and maturation of collecting lymphatic
vessels. Despite the crucial role of Foxc2 in lymphatic development and remodeling, little is known
about the role of Foxc2 in adult physiological and pathological lymphatic function; limitation is largely
due to a lack of appropriate animal models. In this proposed application, the PI recently has generated
novel inducible lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)-specific Foxc2 gain-of-function and Foxc2 loss-of-
function mice. Utilizing these powerful genetic tools, the PI observed that deficiency of LEC Foxc2 in
adult mice dramatically increased the lymphangiogensis, improves impaired lymphatic drainage and
lipid absorption in metabolic disorders (unpublished data). In the K99 phase, the PI will continue the
current project to determine the molecular mechanism by which Foxc2 regulates adult
lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic function in obese model. While in R00 phase, the PI will investigate
the role of Foxc2 in modulating macrophage cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport in
atherosclerotic model, as well as how Foxc2 will affect atherogenesis, which is diverging from his
mentor’s work on Epsin, a family of endocytic adaptor proteins. Moreover, other than the unique mouse
models and cutting-edge techniques, the PI will develop a novel LEC-specific nanoparticle delivery
system based on his recent published platform to specifically target LEC Foxc2, thus may halt
inflammation and inhibit atheroma progression. This proposal will be valuable for restoring impaired
lymphatics to treat cardiovascular and metabolic diseases."

My research goal is to meaningfully advance our understanding of human brain development during the early
stages of human life by pairing advanced neuroimaging approaches with rich, multi-level biobehavioral
assessment strategies. To date, I have obtained extensive training in fMRI data processing, brain network
analysis, and a basic understanding of deep learning. My career development plan builds on this knowledge
base by enhancing my technical skillset and providing crucial, intensive training in developmental
neuroscience, infant behavioral assessment, and advanced longitudinal statistical methodologies. The
completion of the proposed research and training is essential preparation for my future as leader of a cross-
disciplinary team seeking to innovate and advance early human clinical and developmental neuroscience
research.
Research Project: Understanding the sequence and timing of brain functional circuit development at the
beginning of human life is critically important from both normative and clinical perspectives. Yet, we presently
lack rigorous examination of the longitudinal emergence of human brain functional circuitry over the birth
transition. Using multiple cutting-edge methodologies, the goal of this K99/R00 is to map developmental
trajectories and construct a brain maturational index for each individual (the “brain age”) for this period (Aim 1).
In the K99 portion of this award, we will leverage the largest available fetal functional MRI dataset known to us,
with more than 450 longitudinal fetal and neonatal fMRI scans collected in healthy volunteers. We will also
address an important public health issue, prematurity, by comparing the developmental trajectory and the
“brain age” between cases born preterm and those delivered at term (Aim 2). The R00 project will relate brain
development across birth to infant behavioral outcomes and explore the putative role of maternal immune
activation (MIA) (Aim 3). The significance of this work lays in its potential for unveiling fundamental aspects of
brain development at the beginning of human life, and in development of a new longitudinal basis for drawing
comparisons between typical and atypical development. Armed with knowledge about disruptions in early
developing circuitry, we can begin to develop therapies with potential to directly target affected systems. The
innovation of the work lays in utilization of the one-of-the-kind longitudinal perinatal imaging dataset, in
implementation of the state-of-the-art fMRI data processing methodology, in being the first to map both typical
and atypical brain development over the birth transition, and in being the first to develop a brain imaging-
derived maturational index beginning before birth."

 Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US. Use of multiple
tobacco products is becoming increasingly prevalent, with dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes representing
the most common combination. Though e-cigarettes are not without risk, completely switching from cigarettes to
e-cigarettes likely reduces risk for tobacco-related harm. However, the vast majority of established dual users
maintain long-term smoking and the majority, who use e-cigarettes non-daily, are at an even greater risk for
prolonged smoking than exclusive cigarette smokers. The Food and Drug Administration Center for Tobacco
Products (FDA CTP) has announced plans to implement a nicotine-limiting product standard, capping the
nicotine in cigarettes at a minimally or non-addictive level. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate that
exclusive smokers respond to very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes with reductions in smoking, demand,
and dependence. However, nicotine reduction RCTs to date have excluded regular e-cigarette users and
therefore it remains unclear how a nicotine-limiting standard for cigarettes would affect smoking among dual
users. Given the potential substitutability of e-cigarettes for cigarettes, reducing the nicotine in cigarettes could
promote a transition to exclusive e-cigarette use among dual users unable to completely quit nicotine, but only if
sufficiently appealing e-cigarettes remain available. E-cigarettes containing 5% nicotine-salt solution are
currently most popular in the US but policy makers have proposed restricting e-cigarettes to ≤2% nicotine to curb
youth e-cigarette use. Prior laboratory studies indicate that higher vs lower nicotine e-cigarettes serve as better
substitutes for cigarettes among adult dual users. As such, a restriction on e-cigarette nicotine concentration
could undermine the potential for e-cigarettes to substitute for cigarettes and diminish the benefits of a nicotine-
limiting standard for cigarettes among dual users. We propose a 12-week double-blind 2 cigarette level (Normal
Nicotine vs Very Low Nicotine) x 2 e-cigarette level (High Nicotine vs Low Nicotine) between-subjects factorial
trial to investigate how a nicotine-limiting standard for cigarettes affects adult dual users and whether these
effects are impacted by constraints on e-cigarette nicotine concentration. Outcome measures include cigarettes
per day, cigarette dependence, and toxicant exposure. The research is highly relevant to FDA CTP domains of
Addiction and Behavior because it will test whether reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes reduces smoking
and dependence, and whether these effects are moderated by the availability of high vs low nicotine e-cigarettes.
It also addresses the Health Effects domain by assessing toxicant exposure. It is innovative because it is, to our
knowledge, the first RCT of a nicotine-limiting standard among the growing population of US adults who use
multiple tobacco products. Finally, it is programmatic as it builds upon a decade of nicotine reduction research
that we have conducted. Overall, this trial has the potential to provide FDA CTP with evidence on an understudied
population important to its regulatory responsibilities."

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) has been strongly implicated as a causal factor in pathogenesis of atopic
dermatitis (AD) since the 1970s, and is further supported by publications demonstrating S. aureus skin
colonization precedes AD onset. ADRN studies found that 50% of AD subjects are colonized and this AD
phenotype is associated with greater epidermal barrier dysfunction, type 2 immunity, disease severity and
remarkable alterations in the skin microbiome (increased S. aureus relative abundance and reduced
abundance of the commensal bacteria, Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes). Additionally, S. aureus-colonized
AD subjects are more likely to develop a severe viral condition, called eczema herpeticum. An even more
serious condition is eczema vaccinatum, caused by exposure to vaccinia virus (smallpox vaccination), which
has a fatality rate as high as 30%. In an effort to explain this, we found discovered that epidermal exposure
to a highly virulent S. aureus strain (USA300), commonly found on AD subjects, markedly enhances its
susceptibility to vaccinia virus. Collectively, these observations support our hypothesis that S. aureus may be
a key driver of disease severity and response to systemic treatments (Aim 1) as well as serious viral
complications (Aim 2). Determining what role C. acnes, the most abundant commensal skin bacteria, plays
in suppressing S. aureus will be the focus of studies outlined in Aim 3. These studies will leverage the wealth
of deeply-phenotyped AD subjects and their biospecimens from previous ADRN studies (ADRN02-Registry,
ADRN06-ADEH and ADRN09-Dupilumab) and those enrolled into URMCs Longitudinal ‘Real-World’ AD
Study. The Aims demonstrate how the focus is first on the systemic features of S. aureus colonization (e.g.
macro level; Aim 1) and moves to the “epidermal (host) – microbiome” interaction (Aim 2) and ultimately to
the microbe-microbe interaction at the skin surface (e.g. micro level; Aim 3)."
10805549,"Vestibular organs transmit key information to central vestibular nuclei that control body
position and movement in space as well as posture. Exposure to loud noise can result in
dizziness, imbalance, and poor postural control, symptoms which suggest damage to the
vestibular system. Military personnel, who are usually exposed to loud noise during training and
while in theater, are more likely to experience these symptoms. Often symptoms dissipate and
the system appears to be repaired. However, the subtle effect of noise damage may be
cumulative and go unnoticed until the system is challenged, or symptoms manifest later in life
when unsteady gait, imbalance, and poor posture become prominent. This puts our Veterans at
higher risk for falls as they age. Falls account for more than 50% of accidental deaths. Current
tests of otolith function are largely indirect and measures of central vestibular dysfunction are
understudied. Identifying, understanding, and testing interventions for vestibular dysfunction in
humans and in pre-clinical models requires central assessment tools, which are currently lacking
in the field.
 The current studies will examine noise effects on central pathways while validating tools
for future assessment of chronic effects. The goal is to provide a basis for future studies that will
explore longitudinal changes centrally and correlate those changes with behavioral deficits. We
propose to examine the impact of noise on the relationship between peripheral stimulation and
central activity in central brain regions. First, we will compare patterns of activation centrally after
stimulation of otolith vs canal using in vitro and in vivo markers of neuronal activity (Specific Aim
1). In Specific Aim 2, we will use these markers of neuronal activity to assess activity in central
vestibular pathways following the same stimulation delivered in Specific Aim 1 at two time points
after noise exposure. Functional and histological changes will also be assessed."
10808332,"Periodontitis is initiated by oral bacteria, but quickly transits to an inflammatory immune disease with loss of host-
bacterial homeostasis. Homeostasis, the symbiotic balance between host tissues and the resident periodontal
microbiome is disrupted by a dysregulated immune response. From symbiosis to dysbiosis, early innate immune
components are robustly linked. At the host-microbial interface, we have ample evidence that microbes trigger
the immune response but lack knowledge of how the immune response regulates the composition and functional
activity of the microbiome. Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators (SPMs) are a family of eicosanoid lipid mediators
that bind to specific cell receptors to coordinate the return of an inflammatory lesion to homeostasis. Among the
many SPMs, E-series resolvins are naturally occurring metabolites of transformation circuits of the omega-3 fatty
acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), that actively induce resolution of inflammation. Activation of the Resolvin E1
(RvE1) receptor (ERV1) in gain-of-function studies with the ERV1 transgenic mouse (ERV1tg), show profound
resistance to periodontitis. The use of resolvins to control inflammation allows us to test our central hypothesis
that early immune activation directly contributes to the development of periodontal dysbiosis, which can be re-
versed/prevented by activating Resolivin-E1 mediated resolution of inflammation pathways. To test this hypoth-
esis, we break our investigations into two levels. First, in a murine model, we will characterize the oral microbi-
ome’s functional and spatial organizational changes as symbiosis transits to dysbiosis. Second, we will use an
in vitro system to unravel the mechanisms that determine how RvE1 and its receptor (ERV1) influence the dy-
namics of dysbiosis and inflammatory/immune responses in periodontitis. The candidate is a DDS/PhD perio-
dontist who is committed to an academic career dedicated to improving periodontal and oral health. The men-
tored phase of the proposal will be carried out with Dr. Thomas Van Dyke (Primary mentor) and Dr. Xuesong He
(Co-mentor) at the Forsyth Institute. The goal of the K99 phase is to provide additional training, mentoring, and
experience in three important areas 1) advanced bioinformatics training for microbiome data; 2) study design
and biostatistics training; and 3) career development. A strong Scientific Advisory Committee from the Forsyth
Institute, Harvard Medical School, and the University of Washington has been established with diverse expertise
in immunology, microbiology, bioinformatics, and statistics to help guide the candidate providing a training plan
that complements and expands her scientific background with mentors whose expertise spans the broad scope
of the scientific problem. The scientific component and training outlined in this proposal provide a pathway for
the candidate to transit to an independent research career in a tenure track faculty position independent of the
research programs of the mentors. Successful completion of this project will lead to better understanding of
host-microbiome interactions and how to gain control of the inflammation/dysbiosis cycle in periodontitis to ame-
liorate disease.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) presents a serious public health problem despite available and effective medications
for OUD (MOUD). One factor complicating treatment delivery for OUD and contributing to a devasting overdose
(OD) crisis is the proliferation of high potency synthetic opioids (HPSO). HPSO are mu opioid agonists estimated
to be 50-1000 more potent to morphine that have become increasingly common in illicit drug supplies over the
past several years. Despite the ubiquity of HPSO, systematic evaluations of treatment outcomes for those with
OUD who use HPSO remain sparse. Further, factors influencing HPSO physiological dependence and
withdrawal, and potential biomarkers (body weight, body fat percentage, plasma
buprenorphine/norbuprenorphine levels) contributing to individual differences in response to HPSO remain
understudied. There is therefore an urgent need to optimize MOUD use in the context of HPSO and enhance
understanding of how individual differences in response to HPSO influence clinical outcomes. The use of
extended release, injectable buprenorphine (INJ) may improve treatment adherence and confer greater
protection from HPSO-related OD compared to sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone (SLB). However, this
approach remains understudied in this population. GOALS: The primary objectives of this K23 Mentored Patient
Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal are to: Compare abstinence and relapse rates
among those with OUD who use HPSO randomized to receive INJ versus SLB during a 2-day inpatient
induction (Aims 1a and 1b), Examine the effect of quantitative HPSO level on admission on opioid
withdrawal symptoms and dropout during the induction period and (Aim 2), and Explore the relationship
between plasma buprenorphine/norbuprenorphine levels on craving, withdrawal, and time to first use
(Exploratory Aims). DESIGN: Forty adults with OUD who use HPSO will be admitted for a 2-day inpatient
induction period. Following admission on day 1, a COWS score ≥ 6 will prompt administration of 4/1mg SLB.
One hour after tolerating this dose, participants will be randomized to receive 1) a 300 mg extended-release
buprenorphine injection (INJ; n=20) or 2) or a placebo injection followed by continued titration onto SLB (SLB;
n=20). Quantitative HPSO levels (urine derived LC-MS) will be collected on admission. Following discharge,
participants will be scheduled for 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 8-, and 12-week follow up visits. We hypothesize that the INJ
group will have a higher percentage of days abstinent and lower proportion of participants with a sustained
relapse than the SLB group across follow up. Further, we hypothesize that quantitative HPSO level on admission
will be positively associated with withdrawal severity and dropout during the induction period for both groups. In
completing the proposed study, I will gain invaluable training and experience towards my career development
goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher."
10884460,"Numerous studies have reported the efficacy of probiotics for alcohol associated liver disease (ALD). This
reflects a strong interest among the scientific and medical communities in identifying alternative or adjunctive
approaches for ALD, for which there is no current effective or widely accepted therapeutic option. However, in
depth molecular knowledge on how probiotics render their effects is lacking. Patients with ALD often exhibit
manifestations of cholestasis, a liver pathology defined by accumulation of hepatic bile acids (BAs), which are
toxic and are an important causative factor in hepatocyte death and liver injury in ALD. Excess hepatic BA
concentration is partially a result of increased BA de novo synthesis. We have identified a miRNA (miR194) that
is overexpressed in the intestinal epithelial cells in mice fed alcohol. MmiR194 suppresses a nuclear receptor
FXR that is activated by BAs and regulates intestine-derived hormone, FGF15, expression, which plays a major
role in maintaining hepatic BA homeostasis by suppressing BA synthesis via down-regulation of Cyp7A1. While
the BA activation of FXR is well-studied, how FXR is regulated transcriptionally is less clear. Our preliminary
data showed that probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG-derived nanoparticles (LDNPs) administration reduced
intestinal miR194 and increased FXR and FGF15 expression, and decreased hepatic BAs and fatty liver in mice
with ALD. We hypothesize that alcohol suppresses both the transcriptional expression and ligand-mediated
activation of FXR in the intestine through upregulating miR194 and disturbing gut-microbiome-BA transformation,
respectively, which lead to the increases in hepatic de novo BA synthesis, lipogenesis and ALD and that LDNP
supplementation can diminish alcohol-induced increases in BA synthesis and lipogenesis and attenuate ALD
through suppressing intestinal miR194 expression and regulating gut microbiome BA transformation. The
following specific aims will be pursued to test this hypothesis: Aim 1. Determine the role of intestinal miR194 in
the alcohol-induced dysregulation of liver BA synthesis and lipogenesis. Aim 2. Determine the role of LDNPs in
the regulation of intestinal miR194-FXR-FGF15 signaling in ALD. AIM 3. Determine whether LDNP treatment
alters gut microbiota and BA profile that contribute to FXR activation in ALD. Aim 4. Evaluate the intestinal
miR194 and FXR activity in patients with AH. In summary, the proposed study represents the first molecular
study on how intestinal miRNA regulates liver BA homeostasis and how a probiotic product targets intestinal
miRNA194-FXR-FGF15 singling in ALD. The results obtained from this study may lead to improved management
of ALD."
10910455,"Hispanic/Latino gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (HLMSM) are disproportionately
affected by HIV. Medical mistrust is associated with these HIV disparities among HLMSM because mistrust
may result in delayed or reduced use of needed HIV prevention (e.g., HIV testing and PrEP uptake) and care
(e.g., antiretroviral therapy [ART]) services. A profound need exists for increased understanding of the drivers
of medical mistrust and for effective multilevel interventions to address these drivers among HLMSM in the US.
We propose a mixed-methods study to better understand the drivers of medical mistrust and to refine and test
a multilevel intervention designed to address these drivers and increase the use of needed HIV prevention and
care services among Spanish-speaking, English-speaking, and bilingual (including Spanish and English, or an
indigenous language and Spanish and/or English) HLMSM in Mecklenburg County, NC, a jurisdiction
prioritized by the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the US (EHE) initiative.
 In Aim 1, our community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership will collect, analyze, and
interpret qualitative and quantitative data to expand our understanding of the multilevel drivers of medical
mistrust among Spanish-speaking, English-speaking, and bilingual HLMSM. In Aim 2, we will refine a status-
neutral, culturally congruent, and bilingual multilevel intervention to address identified drivers of medical
mistrust and increase HIV testing, PrEP uptake, and use of HIV care services among Spanish-speaking,
English-speaking, and bilingual HLMSM. This intervention will be based on our partnership’s previous
evidence-based interventions and will blend community-based peer navigation and mHealth. In Aim 3, we will
implement and test the intervention through a longitudinal group-randomized design using a quantitative
assessment collected at: (1) baseline, (2) immediate post-intervention, and (3) 6-month follow-up. Our
hypothesis is that participants randomized to the intervention group, relative to their counterparts randomized
to the delayed-intervention group, will demonstrate reduced medical mistrust and increased HIV testing, PrEP
uptake, and use of HIV care services. We also will conduct in-depth interviews with a sample of participants
and HIV prevention and care service providers at 6-month follow-up.
 This CBPR study aligns with strategies, goals, and objectives of the EHE initiative, the National
HIV/AIDS Strategy, and Healthy People 2030. It will increase our understanding of the drivers of medical
mistrust and will yield a tested status-neutral, culturally congruent, and bilingual multilevel intervention to
intervene on these drivers and increase use of HIV prevention and care services, thus potentially increasing
health equity and reducing disparities within a population disproportionately impacted by HIV – HLMSM.
Findings will be broadly disseminated to inform public health practice, research, and policy to promote health
equity and reduce HIV disparities among HLMSM in the US."
10796984,"Title: Regulation of beige adipocyte maintenance and its impact on metabolic outcomes
Project Summary/Abstract
A potential therapeutic target to curb the global obesity and diabetes epidemic is thermogenic beige fat within
white adipose tissue (WAT). Unlike white adipocyte which stores fat, beige adipocytes are stimulated
thermogenic fat cells in WAT that robustly consume lipid and glucose. However, Beige adipocytes quickly
disappear upon the removal of stimuli, a process further accelerated by age and obesity. This creates a key
challenge to explore beige adipocytes as a sustainable therapy for chronic metabolic diseases. A long-term goal
of my laboratory is to understand the development and maintenance of beige adipocytes, and the metabolic
outcomes. In our preliminary studies using unique mouse models, we demonstrate that beige adipocytes can be
induced and maintained by pharmacological and genetical measures. Further, our preliminary results suggest
that these induced beige adipocytes are maintained in the older mice, even without continuous stimulation.
These exciting findings, although preliminary in nature, suggest novel measures to use beige adipocyte as
potential therapeutics to treat obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases. In this application, we will
investigate whether the sustained beige adipocytes can improve the metabolic fitness under both health and
disease conditions, thereby achieving anti-obesity and anti-diabetes effects. Furthermore, we will elucidate the
critical molecular mechanisms by which beige adipocyte identity is preserved. In addition, we will employ cell-
type selective transcriptomic approach to comprehensively characterize the molecular components involved in
beige adipocyte maintenance."

TET-family of dioxygenases mediate DNA demethylation by sequentially oxidizing 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-
hydroxymethyl- (5hmC), 5-formyl- (5fC) and 5-carboxyl-cytosine (5caC). TET enzymes are required for normal
development and loss-of TET function due to mutations, metabolic reprogramming, hypoxia and other additional
mechanisms occurs frequently in many hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Recent studies have
identified mutations in TET proteins and metabolic enzymes which regulate TET catalytic activity in a large cohort
of patients with Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the clinical significance of these mutations
in DLBCL and the molecular mechanisms through which TET proteins suppress development of malignancies
in general, is not well-understood.
Studies from us and others have highlighted that TET activity is required for differentiation of mature B cells; the
cell-of-origin for DLBCL. To investigate the role of TET loss-of-function in the pathogenesis of DLBCL, I recently
generated mice with B-cell-specific deletion of TET2 and TET3 proteins. Deletion of TET2 and TET3 in mouse
B cells caused development of aggressive lymphomas and rapid mortality. Preliminary analysis of TET-deficient
B cells revealed increased genomic instability and a striking accumulation of unusual secondary DNA structures
called G-quadruplexes (G-quads). The accumulation of G-quads occurred at early stages of B-cell expansion
and was also a feature associated with TET-deficiency in other cellular lineages. G-quad structures have been
linked to genomic instability and transcriptional alterations in cancers but their physiological functions in normal
cells and pathological roles in malignant cells remain poorly understood.
For the studies proposed here, I hypothesize that TET proteins function as tumor suppressors by limiting the
accumulation of G-quad structures. Studies in Aim1 will examine the association of G-quad structures with TET
activity, genomic instability and transcriptional alterations during TET loss-of-function induced
lymphomagenesis. Aim2 will interrogate molecular mechanisms by which TET proteins limit the accumulation of
G-quad structures. Aim3 will focus on delineating mechanisms by which G-quads regulate chromatin structure
and function in normal and malignant B cells. Studies in Aim2 and Aim3 will be performed in R00 phase and will
likely prime the emergence of many new lines of investigations. Together, these studies will use B cells as a
model system to understand the mechanistic basis for the broad tumor suppressive functions of TET proteins
and will reveal novel facets about the biological functions of G-quad structures.
The proposal outlines a specific training plan for the K99 and R00 phases, to acquire the skillset necessary to
perform the proposed studies and successfully transition to an independent position. During this process, I
anticipate to develop an independent line of research through my continued training in an excellent research
environment, facilitated by an outstanding mentoring team."
10796994,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 This proposal describes a concerted approach to the design, synthesis, and study of novel self-
assembling molecules that are responsive to specific proteins. We take two complementary approaches. First,
we develop design guidelines where proteins act as the trigger to deconstruct a higher order assembly to a
lower order one (protein-responsive supramolecular disassembly). In this process, the assemblies transform
from an effective host for hydrophobic small molecules to an ineffective one, which has implications in
developing precise therapeutic responses to protein imbalances. In the second approach, we propose to
develop molecular design guidelines that program a non-assembling polymer to transform into a higher order
assembly in response to proteins (protein-templated self-assembly). The resultant nanoassemblies are
programmed to release these encapsulated proteins in their pristine form in the presence of a specific
biologically-relevant stimulus or due to a combination of such stimuli. Such a strategy will offer the ability to
traffic proteins across a cellular membrane and release them inside cells, which has implications in several
unmet challenges in biomedicine.
 In the protein-responsive supramolecular disassembly approach, we propose to develop versatile
supramolecular assemblies that disassemble in response to specific proteins as stimuli. There have been
great advances in stimuli-sensitive supramolecular assemblies. However, these have primarily focused on
systems that respond to changes in factors such as pH, temperature, or redox conditions, which are
secondary imbalances in biology. The most direct and primary indicator of imbalance in biology involves
change in protein activity. Therefore, generating supramolecular assemblies that respond to proteins is
exciting. Our primary objective is to obtain a better understanding of the structural factors that control the
assembly/disassembly events in response to specific combinations of enzymatic and non-enzymatic proteins.
 In the protein-templated self-assembly approach, the templating proteins are incarcerated as guests into
a matrix of host polymers. The resultant nanoassemblies are programmed to release these encapsulated
proteins in their pristine form in the presence of a specific biologically-relevant stimulus or due to a
combination of such stimuli. A key goal of the proposed research is to develop this into a new supramolecular
platform that is useful for a broad range of soluble proteins, a capability that does not currently exist. The
primary premise of the proposed research then is to develop a fundamental framework for custom-designing
such supramolecular assemblies that can predictably encapsulate a protein, turn its function off, protect it
from denaturation in non-native environments, and regain its native structure and function in response to a
stimulus that is specific to the target environment. We will identify the structural factors that underlie the
formation of these programmable molecular assemblies."

Emerging data demonstrates a rise in methamphetamine (meth) use among Black gay, bisexual and other
men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Meth is associated with myriad physical and social harms, and has the
potential to exacerbate existing health inequities impacting Black GBMSM. Existing meth prevention and
treatment interventions do not address the unique social position of Black GBMSM or the related health
impacts of structural racism and discrimination (SRD). Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that
four forms of SRD are likely to influence meth use among Black GBMSM: housing discrimination, gentrification,
racial and income segregation, and discriminatory LGBT community climate. Additionally, we posit that these
forms of SRD operate through housing instability and inadequate service access to increase risk for meth use
among Black GBMSM. The goal of this project is to generate knowledge that will inform the design of multi-
level, culturally congruent structural approaches to prevent meth use and associate harms among Black
GBMSM. Our study will be based in Atlanta, Georgia – an ideal setting to examine these questions given the
cultural significance for Black Americans, large population of Black GBMSM, and recent SRD-related
demographic shifts. Drawing on the risk environment framework as its theoretical foundation, this study will
pursue three specific aims: (1) to examine the impacts of census-tract level measures of SRD on housing
instability, service access and meth use among Black GBMSM in Atlanta; (2) to elicit narratives of meth use,
housing instability, service access and SRD among Black GBMSM; and (3) to examine systems of structural
influence and develop qualitative causal maps linking various forms of SRD, service access, housing and meth
use among Black GBMSM. For the first aim, we will recruit N=300 Black GBMSM into a longitudinal cohort
study, and conduct serial surveys every 6 months over a two-year follow-up period. Additional location and
meth use data will be obtained monthly using ecological momentary assessment technology. Individual survey
responses will be linked to geolocated census-tract level measures of SRD and service access. For the second
aim, we will conduct a longitudinal qualitative study including in-depth interviews and walking ethnographies
with N=40 cohort participants, to gather insights on their experiences with SRD, housing, service access and
meth use. For the third aim, we will use a community-based system dynamics approach to convene a group
model building workshop with key stakeholders (N=25), which will lead directly to the development of causal
maps that will inform structural interventions. The proposed research is highly significant because of its
potential to inform effective structural strategies for preventing meth use and ameliorating meth-related harms
among Black GBMSM."

Aging and carrying the APOE e4 allele are among the strongest risk factors for developing late-onset Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Several lines of evidence reveal an increase in endosomal trafficking proteins in the brains of
APOE e4 allele carriers decades before the onset of cognitive decline. However, there is a major gap in our
understanding of the critical mechanisms by which the ApoE4 protein regulates endosomal trafficking. The
activity of the ATP binding cassette 1 (ABCA1) has an important role in the endocytosis of lipid-poor ApoE to
initiate its endosomal recycling. This facilitates lipidation of ApoE and its recycling into the extracellular space.
Loss of ABCA1 activity increases lipid-poor and aggregated ApoE particles. In humans, genetic loss-of-function
mutations in ABCA1 are associated with increased AD risk. We hypothesize that aggregation of lipid-poor ApoE4
is at the root of endosomal trafficking dysregulation, and that activation of ABCA1 to lipidate ApoE decreases its
aggregation and favors its endosomal recycling. To address this hypothesis, we propose the following three
Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we determine the mechanisms of how ApoE and ABCA1 activity regulate endosomal
trafficking in primary astrocytes, neurons and microglia. In Aim 2, we determine the effect of aging, APOE4
genotype and enhancing ABCA1 activity on ApoE aggregation and endosomal trafficking pathways in brains of
ApoE targeted replacement mice, and in existing well-characterized human brain tissues that differ by APOE
genotype and cognitive state. In aim 3, we propose to develop an 18-F CS-6253 PET imaging modality to assess
the effect of APOE e4 and aging on ABCA1 brain activity in vivo. Achieving our aims will provide a detailed
understanding of the effect of APOE4 on endosomal trafficking proteins, demonstrating a novel concept that
activation of ABCA1 can ameliorate the congestion of ApoE4 containing endosomes. The information obtained
is of major significance to understanding early events that predispose to AD pathology and developing
therapeutic strategies focused on enhancing ABCA1 activity."

Opioid overdoses caused almost 70,000 deaths in the US in the year ending in November 2020. Many of these
occur during the therapeutic use of prescription opioids, particularly when consumption is erratic or among
workers from certain professions. Despite the promotion of naloxone for opioid overdose, the effective rescue of
an individual from an overdose during the therapeutic use of opioids is still very challenging for several reasons:
(1) the onset of an opioid overdose may be very difficult for the patient or their associates to rapidly recognize;
(2) the time between the onset of respiratory depression and irreversible brain damage or death is brief; leaving
a brief time window to seek medical help and intervene; and (3) methods employed by self- or bystanders to
treat an opioid overdose may not be available or are complicated for lay individuals to use. Thus, there is an
urgent and unmet need for real-time detection and automated treatment of opioid overdose, even during the
therapeutic use of opioids. The overall objective of this U01 application is to develop an automated portable
system to detect and treat an opioid overdose in real time. The research team pursues engineering advances in
developing wearable sensors for real-time tracking of multiple physiological parameters and therapeutic patches
for precise transdermal delivery of naloxone, respectively. The proposed project will further develop wearable
sensors to track the variation of physiological parameters (e.g., breathing pattern, blood oxygen level, and heart
rate) for the real-time detection of an opioid overdose. The proposed project also aims to optimize novel acoustic
patches to deliver naloxone for treating an opioid overdose. A closed-loop system will be established through
integration of a wearable sensor, a therapeutic patch, a machine learning-based controller driven by a cell phone.
The proposed system will be validated using a mouse model of opioid overdose well developed in the PI’s lab,
and adapted for the potential translational applications in human patients. The ultimate product of this study is
to construct a prototype system for real-time detection and automated treatment of an opioid overdose."

This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award involves complementary research
and training plans to develop and then pilot a modified motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive
behavioral therapy (MET-CBT) intervention tailored to target alcohol use in patients with alcohol use disorder
(AUD) in opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Alcohol use is an under-recognized contributor to the opioid crisis,
greatly increasing the risk of overdose when used together with opioids. Further, alcohol use and related
problems are prevalent among patients in OAT and significantly increase the risk of opioid relapse and
treatment dropout. Office-based buprenorphine treatment, a fast-growing form of OAT, is effective at treating
opioid use disorder and decreasing risk of opioid overdose, but relapse rates are high in the first year of
treatment. With nearly 130 individuals dying each day from an opioid overdose and evidence of recent
increases in overdoses during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to increase treatment
retention. Reducing alcohol use and use-related problems in patients receiving buprenorphine may have a
significant indirect effect on improving buprenorphine outcomes. However, past randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) have found no condition effect for brief alcohol-focused intervention for patients in OAT, despite
considerable evidence that these interventions are generally effective at reducing alcohol use. Critically, past
work examined standard alcohol interventions that were not tailored to individuals in OAT, suggesting that
there are unique and significant challenges to alcohol intervention in patients receiving buprenorphine. This
K23 project will first qualitatively interview patients with AUD in their first year of office-based buprenorphine
treatment and buprenorphine providers to directly inform modifications to an existing MET-CBT protocol,
tailoring the intervention to fit the needs and challenges of buprenorphine treatment. Following treatment
development and refinement, 60 participants will be randomized to receive two MET-CBT sessions or
treatment as usual in a proof-of-concept RCT. Key RCT outcomes will be the feasibility and acceptability of the
modified MET-CBT intervention. Sustained benefit will also be evaluated at 1- and 3-month follow-ups in
exploratory analyses. Through addressing AUD in people receiving OAT, this proposal is closely aligns with
national priorities to improve OAT-related outcomes and to respond to the opioid overdose crisis."

10797002,"ABSTRACT
High-grade gliomas (HGG) are the deadliest of all primary brain tumors. They are incurable and median survival
is between 18-24 months. Gliomas infiltrate the healthy brain tissue surrounding the tumor. Thus, even if these
tumors do not metastasize, patients die due to local tumor recurrence. Collagens are a central component of the
extracellular matrix of high-grade gliomas, and promote invasion and tumor growth. How they do so is complex,
and not fully understood. Collagen provides structural stiffness to the extracellular matrix, through physical
mechanisms. In addition to physical mechanisms, biochemically collagen affects intracellular mechanisms.
Collagen affects intracellular signaling by interacting with a large number of collagen receptors. These receptors
are: integrins, discoidin domain receptors DDR1 and DDR2, GPVI, MRC2 and LAIR-1. Leukocyte-associated
immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 (LAIR- 1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein, its extracellular segment contains a
single immunoglobulin-like (Ig- like) domain, and its intracellular segment has two immuno- receptor tyrosine-
based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). LAIR-1 is strongly expressed on T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells,
macrophages and other immune cells. LAIR-1 strongly suppresses immune cell activation, thus reducing
immune responses. Collagen-rich tumors, especially collagens I and III activate LAIR-1 in CD8+ T cells, and
reduce T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Thus, activation of LAIR-1 on immune cells has been proposed as a
mechanism by which tumors inhibit antitumor immune responses. Surprisingly, we found that LAIR-1 is also
expressed in glioma cells. Expression of LAIR-1 in other solid tumors, such as cervical, breast and kidney cancer
increases tumor aggressiveness. Thus, we postulate that LAIR-1 could affect glioma progression by directly
increasing the pathogenesis of cancer cells, and indirectly, by inhibiting the anti-tumor cytotoxic immune
responses. Knockdown of collagen from genetically engineered mouse models of glioma increased median
survival, and reduced LAIR-1 expression within brain tumors. Thus, collagen could directly inhibit anti-glioma
immune responses, or affect the malignant behavior of glioma cells. There is thus a critical need for a mechanistic
understanding of how LAIR-1 expressed by either infiltrating immune cells or glioma tumor cells contributes to
glioma progression and invasion and how it remodels the tumor immune microenvironment. Our long-term goal
is to understand how the extracellular tumor matrix, through its expression of collagen affects tumor progression
and anti-tumor immunity. Our overall objectives in this application are to test the hypothesis that LAIR-1
expression in glioma cells increases tumor progression (AIM 1), the role of LAIR-1 expression in regulating the
function of infiltrating immune cells (AIM 2), and determine the therapeutic potential of the inhibition of LAIR-1 in
glioma models (AIM 3). Our central hypothesis is that LAIR-1 plays essential pathological roles that contribute
to glioma progression through its expression in glioma cells and in immune cells and that inhibiting LAIR-1
signaling could uncover novel therapeutic targets for HGG."

As the most common cause of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is pathologically defined by amyloid beta
(Aβ) deposition in senile plaques and tau aggregation in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In addition to
amyloidosis and tauopathy, demyelination is also a consistent, yet often overlooked, feature of AD. Notably,
myelin loss is detected even at early stages of disease with decreases observed in patients with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI). This implicates that dysregulation of the oligodendrocyte cell population, the brain’s myelin-
producing cells, may be a critical factor in AD pathophysiology. Several recent studies from multiple groups
consistently identified transcriptional alterations in myelination networks as a key feature of AD, underscoring
the great need to elucidate disease-related alterations in the oligodendrocyte population to provide novel
insights into AD pathophysiology. Of particular relevance, tau accumulation is associated with loss of white
matter integrity in both human patients and mouse models of tauopathy. White matter abnormalities have even
been detected in cognitively-normal carriers of the apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) genotype, a population at
high risk of developing AD. Given that ApoE4 has been shown to potentiate tau toxicity and ischemia-induced
white matter damage in mice, these findings may indicate that tau burden and ApoE4 converge to drive white
matter abnormalities in AD. Considering that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) respond to white matter
damage by migrating to the site of injury and differentiating into myelinating oligodendrocytes to repair the
lesion, a key question is why OPCs and/or oligodendrocytes fail to correct white matter abnormalities in the
presence of abnormal forms of tau and/or ApoE4. A recent study found that OPCs in both postmortem brain
and a mouse model of AD exhibited markers of cellular senescence, with pharmacologic removal of senescent
OPCs alleviating inflammation and cognitive defects in mice. These results provide compelling evidence that
OPC dysfunction may actually contribute to and exacerbate disease progression in AD. As such, the current
study will investigate the impact of tau pathology and APOE genotype on abnormalities in OPCs and
oligodendrocytes, including remyelination ability. In addition, given that deletion of the ApoE receptor, Lrp1,
from OPCs provided neuroprotection, stimulated myelin repair and reduced inflammation in mouse models of
demyelination, we will evaluate the protective effect of Lrp1 deficiency in OPCs in the context of tauopathy, as
well as the role in exacerbation of tauopathy in the presence of ApoE4. Collectively, the current project will
identify key functional and transcriptional alterations observed in the OPC/oligodendrocyte population in
response to tauopathy and ApoE4, and determine whether loss of Lrp1 in OPCs mitigates ApoE4-mediated
exacerbation of tau pathology."

Clopidogrel as well as other P2Y12 receptor inhibitors are commonly prescribed to prevent recurrent thrombotic
events in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Variability in
in response to these medications is well-established and contributes to increased risk of experiencing a
cardiovascular event when high platelet reactivity persists or in pathological bleeding when on-treatment
platelet aggregation is too low. While substantial effort has been made to identify the determinants of
clopidogrel response, much of the variability still remains unaccounted for. In this application, we utilize novel
methodologies and analytical strategies to identify unknown biomarkers that impact clopidogrel efficacy. In
Specific Aim 1, we integrate pharmacogenomic data, deep metabolomic profiling, clopidogrel pharmacokinetic
assessment, and extensive platelet-based phenotyping in participants of the Pharmacogenomics of Anti-
Platelet Intervention (PAPI) Study to unveil new insights into the mechanisms of variable drug action and
response. Specifically, in 599 PAPI participants, we will perform genome-wide association studies pre- and
post-clopidogrel intervention (75mg/d for 7d) for platelet aggregation, parent prodrug and clopidogrel active
metabolite concentrations, and approximately 1,000 metabolites measured through metabolomic profiling.
These data will be used to perform informed pathway/network analysis, Mendelian randomization, and
Bayesian colocalization to better understand multiomic signatures of clopidogrel exposure and response and to
build metabolomics-informed polygenic risk scores (miPRS) for prediction of low and high on-treatment platelet
aggregation. In Specific Aim 2, we extend these findings in over 2,800 patients with cardiovascular disease
recruited into the International Clopidogrel Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ICPC). In this large clinical
investigation of antiplatelet therapy, we will attempt to replicate significant single-SNP associations with platelet
aggregation as well as assess potential impact on recurrent cardiovascular event risk. Moreover, we will deploy
miPRSs developed in the PAPI Study and compare this instrument to previously published risk scores with
respect to platelet reactivity and major adverse cardiovascular outcomes including myocardial infarction,
stroke, and cardiovascular-related death. To date, no investigation has systematically evaluated the metabolic
consequences of clopidogrel exposure nor utilized pharmacometabolomic strategies to better understand
variable antiplatelet efficacy or response prediction. We anticipate that the completion of the research
proposed in this application will enhance precision medicine efforts through identification of novel multiomic
signatures and biomarkers that predict response to clopidogrel therapy and will establish clinical strategies
aimed at defining optimal personalized treatment plans to reduce adverse clinical outcomes in those with
increased recurrent cardiovascular event risk."

Heart transplantation is a definitive treatment option for patients with end-stage heart failure. While short-term
survival has made substantial improvements, long-term outcomes are limited by chronic graft failure. Cardiac
allograft hypertrophy (CAH) is a clinical phenomenon referring to the gradual increase of left ventricular mass
and wall thickness of cardiac grafts. CAH onset can occur as early as 2 months after transplantation, which
often lead to progressive changes in cellular environment including cardiomyocytes hypertrophy and fibrosis
and accumulate to graft failure in long term. The complete landscape of cellular system in transplant patients
represents a major gap in knowledge. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as powerful tool
to analyze diverse cell types and cell states as well as pseudo-time topologies of single cells in complex
organs, which however lacks the power to infer cell lineages that is important for identify the origins of
pathogenic cells. In this project, we will develop a novel single cell multi-omics sequencing technology and
several computational tools, which will enable simultaneous detection of cell lineage markers (i.e. DNAs) and
cell fate markers (i.e. RNAs) from same cells. We will also distinguish donor and host identities for all cells to
study their distinct roles in CAH that are largely unknown. We hypothesized that CAH is initiated by specific
immune cell subtypes and driven by endothelial to mesenchymal transition that is fueled by enlarged
cardiomyocytes. In aim 1, we will develop novel technology to define a unifying cell lineage and cell fate
roadmap for cardiac cells. Aim 2 will dissect temporal changes of cellular components in transplanted hearts
during CAH early onset. Aim 3 is to trace cell lineages during CAH progression with time-series single cell
multi-omics. Successful completion of this project will lead to the identification of donor and host originated cell
populations as novel therapeutic targets to extend the life of transplant patients."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of respiratory mortality worldwide15.
Identifying highly susceptible individuals early in their disease course and understanding pathogenic
mechanisms, before irreversible loss of lung function, is of utmost importance16,17. Genetics account for about
40% of COPD susceptibility18–20. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple variants
associated with COPD21–23. Individual variants are poor for risk prediction, but in aggregate genetic variants can
account for a substantial portion of risk. Pooling millions of GWAS variants, I created a polygenic risk score (PRS)
for COPD that can identify individuals at high risk for COPD, though performance was less optimal in non-
Europeans24. Multi-ancestry PRSs are needed as genetic ancestry is not readily determined in clinical practice.
Further, gene expression, reflecting genetic and environmental influences, provides pathobiologic information
for COPD susceptibility and heterogeneity. A transcriptional risk score (TRS) for COPD that adds predictive value
above clinical risk factors25 has yet to be developed. The appeal of using -Omics data for risk stratification is that
these data can lend insight into why certain COPD subgroups are at elevated risk of progression. Gene
regulatory networks26 have been used to uncover mechanisms of COPD heterogeneity that were not found by
traditional gene-based approaches. Therefore, we hypothesize that polygenic and transcriptional risk scores will
substantially improve upon clinical factors in identifying those at higher risk for COPD and related phenotypes,
and can be used to identify pathways for therapeutic intervention. We will train multi-ancestry PRSs using 4,225
African ancestry individuals from UK Biobank and existing analyses of 8,429 African-Americans from CHARGE,
and test in the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene: n=10,198) study and Lung Tissue Research
Consortium (LTRC: n=1,078). We will create a multi-ancestry transcriptional risk score (TRS) using whole blood
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data in training (n=3,394) and evaluate predictive performance in testing samples
(n=1,131) of COPDGene. We will use Connectivity Map (CMap)8,27 to identify drug repurposing candidates based
on TRS transcripts. We will leverage lung RNA-seq data from LTRC to create a lung TRS, and test in COPDGene
blood samples. We will classify COPDGene participants along the axes of the existing PRS and lung TRS (e.g.
“High” PRS, “Low” TRS), which we expect will identify those at high risk for COPD-related phenotypes and
progression. To understand why certain individuals are at high risk for COPD phenotypes, we will utilize gene
regulatory networks to identify pathways differing between PRS/TRS classifications, and use the Gene
RegulAtory Network Database (GRAND)9 to prioritize drug repurposing candidates. These aims will generate
data for future studies, which will focus on validating COPD -Omics risk scores and drug candidates in real-world
cohorts1, and using machine learning to predict the network effects of drug candidates. The proposed research
and career development plan will train me to use machine learning for multi-omic integration and risk prediction."
10812302,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although dementia has a global impact, efforts to address ensuing challenges have come mostly from high-
income countries (HICs). Whereas the prevalence and incidence of dementia appear to be stable or declining
in such countries, an alarmingly opposite tendency typifies South American countries (SAC). This scenario
proves even more challenging due to region-specific traits. First, the particular genetic and environmental
backgrounds of SAC limit the generalizability of key findings from HICs. Moreover, the greater genetic diversity
and impact of socioeconomic status (SES) of SAC remain markedly understudied. Of note, this is true of the
four largest SAC (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru), representing over 75% of the region’s population. In
addition, SAC face a dearth of innovative, harmonized, and cross-regional studies on two of their most
prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is
thus critical for SAC to join ongoing international efforts and develop a gold-standard approach for detecting
disease-specific alterations in a context of methodological, genetic, and socioeconomic heterogeneity. Against
this background, our long-term goal is to identify the unique genetic and SES factors that drive AD and FTD
presentation in SAC relative to the US. To this end, we will establish a cohort to test large samples from the
four abovementioned SAC, as well as the US (totaling > 3000 participants, including 1500 controls, 750 AD
patients, and 750 FTD patients). We will combine standardized clinical assessments with innovative analytical
techniques including multimodal machine learning to account for heterogeneity in these diverse populations.
By combining standardized genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (SES-cognitive) measures, we will test the
underlying hypothesis that there are unique risk factors for AD and FTD in SAC which do not prove significant
in US populations. More particularly, we will aim to (a) establish genetic risk to AD and FTD in diverse SAC
cohorts; (b) test whether patients from SAC and the US can be discriminated after accounting for how SES
affects cognitive and brain imaging signatures; and (c) determine genetic, cognitive, cerebral, and
socioeconomic factors that discriminate among SAC vs. US patients. Positive impacts of this work include a
better understanding of the genetic and socioeconomic factors driving neurocognitive manifestations of
dementia, and the identification of novel genetic targets for risk reduction and disease prevention in SAC. Our
large multimodal, cross-sectional study will enable clinical assessment of understudied patient groups, extend
and harmonize existing data sets, and prompt the development of novel measures and multimodal machine
learning protocols. More generally, by establishing a collaborative framework which capitalizes on unique
regional populations, our proposal can consolidate a SAC-based platform for future translational research and
assessment."
10812303,"Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs), such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and
interstitial lung disease (ILD) are currently the 4th leading cause of death in the U.S., yet often remain
undiagnosed and under-treated until the advanced stages. Current research suggests an increased
prevalence and rising incidence of CRDs among Veterans relative to the general population. Yet, despite a
high prevalence and evidence supporting improved outcomes with early medical management, no screening
programs currently exist for CRDs. Chest computed tomography (CT), a medical imaging modality employed
for lung cancer screening (LCS), can detect structural changes in the lungs associated with CRDs, but their
use has been limited by (1) the labor-intensive nature and inter-person variability of visual interpretation of
images, (2) clinical reports which are often focused solely on acute findings (lung nodules, pneumonia) with
inconsistent reporting of chronic conditions. Quantitative imaging analysis (QIA) techniques have been
developed which can objectively detect and quantify a broad range of pathological changes directly from chest
CT imaging data, often with increased sensitivity relative to visual methods. We assert the application of QIA
to clinically obtained chest CT data within the auspices of well-organized LCS program represents an
opportunity to identify and characterize undiagnosed CRDs among a high-risk Veteran population.
 We propose to develop and validate a clinical tool, the Quantitative Imaging Analysis-based Risk
Summary (QIA-RS), which will translate imaging information from LCS chest CTs into practicable evidence
in three CRD domains: lung function impairment, symptoms and functional status, and future respiratory
healthcare utilization. QIA will be performed using TRM-approved software behind the VA firewall to assess
features of CRD (e.g. emphysema, airway wall thickness, interstitial lung abnormalities, and total lung
capacity) on archived and newly acquired chest CT data from patients enrolled in the VA Boston LCS program
(4,777 unique referrals between 2017-2019, with ~1400 new referrals/year). Clinically-ascertained spirometry
available in approximately 2,400 subjects, will be used to train and validate models to predict lung function
impairment using QIA features as predictors (QIA-RS lung function impairment domain – Aim 1). Because
individuals with undiagnosed CRDs (the target population for our QIA-RS tool) have been incompletely
characterized in the literature, we propose to recruit individuals with no previous history of lung disease at the
time of LCS (n=300) for an in-person study visit where lung function, respiratory symptoms, and functional
status (exercise capacity, health related quality of life) will be assessed and used to identify thresholds of QIA-
assessed features associated with impairments (Aim 2 – QIA-RS respiratory symptom and functional status
domain). We will follow individuals recruited in Aim 2 (n=300) via telephony and medical record review for 12
months to assess prospective (a) respiratory events (telephone, outpatient, urgent care / emergency,
hospitalization encounters for respiratory symptoms) and (b) new respiratory medication use and will integrate
data on lung function and respiratory symptoms (Aim 2) and common and low abundance inflammatory
markers to refine risk estimates for QIA-assessed features as predictors of respiratory outcomes (Aim 3 –
QIA-RS respiratory healthcare utilization domain). The validated QIA-RS tool, which will provide succinct
reports of risks associated with CRDs along with actionable recommendations for care, represents a scalable,
imaging-based solution to identify and risk stratify previously undiagnosed CRDs among Veterans. This
application of QIA technology to clinically-ascertained imaging studies represents an innovative and efficient
use of existing data to promote the delivery of personalized care for individual Veterans and will assist in
resource allocation for disease management at the organizational level."

 Mechanisms of PSGL-1 restriction of HIV virion infectivity
Restriction factors are an important component of host innate immunity. Studying the anti-HIV mechanisms of
restriction factors is central to understanding virus-host interaction. These mechanisms may also offer new
therapeutic strategies to inactivate viral reservoirs to achieve lasting HIV remission. Recently, we have
identified a new HIV restriction factor, PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1), that can inactivate the
infectivity of HIV virions released from HIV producing cells. PSGL-1 is a dimeric mucin-like 120-KD
glycoprotein that is primarily expressed on the surface of lymphoid and myeloid cells. PSGL-1 binds to P-, L-,
and E-selectin, and mediates leukocyte tethering and rolling on endothelium for leukocyte migration into
inflamed tissues. PSGL-1 is also an INF-γ-regulated factor involved in Th1-mediated anti-viral activity. Our
preliminary mechanistic studies further revealed that PSGL-1 is incorporated into viral particles, which blocks
HIV Env incorporation and disables the ability of virions to attach to target CD4 T cells for infection. In
addition, we found that PSGL-1 is antagonized by Vpu and Nef through surface down-regulation. Based on
these preliminary studies, we hypothesize that: (1) PSGL-1-mediated restriction of HIV infectivity involves its
specific domains; (2) PSGL-1 restricts HIV infectivity likely through competitive exclusion of Env
incorporation during viral assembly and steric hindrance of Env binding to cell receptors (3) Nef-mediated
PSGL-1 down-regulation is likely achieved through linking PSGL-1 to components of clathrin-dependent
trafficking pathways. In this application, we will pursue the following aims: Specific Aim 1 is to characterize
PSGL-1 for inactivating HIV infectivity. We propose to identify PSGL-1 domains key to restricting HIV-1. We
will determine the structure-function relationship of PSGL-1, defining the roles of PSGL-1 dimerization, N-
terminal glycosylation and tyrosine sulfation, N-terminal decameric repeats, and the polybasic region in
restricting HIV. Specific Aim 2 is to perform mechanistic studies of PSGL-1 inactivation of HIV viral
infectivity. We hypothesized that PSGL-1 restricts HIV infectivity likely through two possible mechanisms: (1)
competitive exclusion of Env incorporation during viral assembly; (2) steric hindrance of residual Env binding
to cell receptors. We will test these two hypotheses to determine the mechanisms of action. Specific Aim 3 is to
study the mechanism of Nef-mediated surface down-regulation of PSGL-1. We will identify functional
domains of Nef and PSGL-1 for their involvement in PSGL-1 down-regulation. Nef-mediated PSGL-1
downregulation may facilitate viral spread in immune cells."
10812399,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This K08 research and training award will enable the PI to attain the substantive and methodological expertise
necessary to conduct independent research on nicotine use in young adults and to translate this knowledge to
clinical trial development. Dual use of electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) and combustible cigarettes is
the most prevalent pattern of tobacco use among US young adults (age 18–25). Characterizing shared,
distinct, and cross-conditioned processes that maintain dual use is essential for informing interventions against
smoking among vulnerable dual users. The incentive sensitization and affect processing models of drug
addiction highlight how drug cues and attentional bias for cues are central drivers of drug craving and use and
how negative affect strengthens these relationships. I propose to examine the degree to which these three
processes (cue-reactivity, attentional bias, and negative affect) underlie tobacco craving and in laboratory and
naturalistic settings among a sample of young adult dual users (n = 80). Significant innovations include
examining cross-product conditioning of cues in young adult dual users; integrating data across laboratory and
naturalistic settings; and identifying shared and distinct processes in ENDS versus combustible cigarettes. I will
examine the effects that in-vivo neutral, ENDS, or combustible cigarette cues have on craving for usual-brand
cigarettes or preferred ENDS devices in three laboratory sessions. A visual probe task will index attention bias;
participants will self-report positive and negative affect. EMA will be used to gather real-time data from the
same participants evaluating predictors of tobacco use and craving that correspond to laboratory measures
(mood, tobacco cues), as well as salient social and behavioral correlates. Person- and event-level effects of
cue reactivity, attentional bias, cross-product conditioning, and the interactive effect of negative affect will be
modeled using multilevel modeling. Results will elucidate the contribution of attentional, mood, and cue-related
processes to craving and dual use. Findings will inform development of two research projects: a longitudinal
study using survey, EMA, and laboratory methods to characterize the intra-individual behavioral processes
underlying transitions through smoking patterns (especially progression from ENDS to dual user); and
preparation for a clinical trial of a novel just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) targeting dual users who are
either high or low in markers of vulnerability (e.g., cross-product reactivity). A final series of focus groups will
assess the receptivity and acceptability of prototype study-informed JITAI components. Highly skilled mentors,
including Kristina Jackson, Suzanne Colby, Andrea King, Tyler Wray, and Rachel Cassidy and collaborator
Christopher Kahler will provide guidance on training aims: (1) behavioral laboratory assessment methods; (2)
analysis and integration of laboratory and naturalistic data; and (3) translation of laboratory findings to JITAI.
Overall, the research and training outlined in this application informs key gaps in models of tobacco dual use,
and will prepare the PI to conduct independent research furthering scientific inquiry in this field."
10812307,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a state of chronic systemic inflammation and atherosclerosis that
results in the narrowing or occlusion of peripheral arteries, most commonly involving the legs. PAD affects up
to 20% of older adults and is especially prevalent among Veterans due to a high rate of smoking. Nearly 90%
of those with PAD suffer from intermittent claudication (IC), defined as reproducible muscle pain with activity
due to reduced blood flow and is relieved with rest. Those with IC are at increased risk of cardiovascular (CV)
morbidity and mortality with progressive decline in walking speeds and distance, functional independence, and
health related quality of life (HRQoL). The treatment of IC beings with medical optimization with smoking
cessation, aspirin and statin therapy, and exercise. Pharmacological therapies for IC are minimally effective.
Supervised exercise therapy does improve walking distance and functional status but is not easily accessible,
compliance is low, and the benefits are not durable. Ultimately, surgical revascularization is the only effective
therapy that can reliably improve IC symptoms long-term but is invasive and expensive.
 Metformin is an inexpensive, safe, and effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes (DM2). It has numerous
effects that can counteract the reactive oxygen species, systemic inflammation, DNA damage, and
mitochondrial dysfunction that contribute to age related cellular and organ dysfunction. In preclinical studies,
metformin also stimulates angiogenesis and reduces atherosclerotic calcification. Finally, metformin has been
shown to reduce CV specific morbidity and mortality in those with DM2, independent of glucose control. Thus,
we hypothesize that metformin may be an effective treatment for symptomatic PAD. We developed the
MetfOrmin BenefIts Lower Extremities with Intermittent Claudication (MOBILE IC) Trial to evaluate the effect of
metformin on functional status, PAD progression, systemic and vascular inflammation, neutrophil extracellular
traps, exosomes and microRNAs, and mitochondrial function in nonDM2 Veterans with symptomatic PAD. The
trial is a quadruple-blind, phase 3, single institution, randomized controlled trial which was developed with
Veteran input and is based on patient centered outcomes. A total of 200 male and female Veterans with
symptomatic PAD being evaluated at the VA Pittsburgh (VAPHS) vascular clinic will be stratified by maximum
walking distance (MWD) on the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and randomized 1:1 to 6 months of 1000mg of
Metformin ER or placebo daily. This trial has 80% power to determine the effect on the primary outcome of
MWD on the 6MWT at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include validated assessments of overall functionality,
general and disease specific HRQoL, subclinical and clinical PAD progression (ankle brachial index, pulse
volume recordings, and endothelial function by EndoPAT), changes in systemic inflammatory markers and
systemic mitochondrial efficiency and health in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. All functional and clinical
outcomes will be measured at baseline, at 6 months of study drug exposure, and 6 months following the
cessation of study drug. Inflammatory and mitochondrial changes will be evaluated at baseline, at 3 and 6
months of drug exposure, and 6 months following cessation. Continuous variables, including the primary
outcome, will be analyzed using linear mixed-effects model analysis with a fixed treatment assignment and
covariate adjustment for the baseline value. Each of the secondary outcomes best summarized as time-to-
event outcomes will be reported using Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional-hazards or
Fine-Gray models to estimate the difference between treatment groups. Primary analyses for treatment group
comparisons will use an intention-to-treat approach and significance will be determined at an 𝛼 level of 0.05
will be used. The success of the MOBILE IC Trial would support Metformin as an effective, safe, and
inexpensive therapy for PAD that may also have effects on concurrent CV diseases and diseases of aging."
10811437,"Project Summary
Ovarian follicles undergo a series of dynamic changes following the ovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone
including cumulus expansion, oocyte maturation, ovulation and luteinization. Post-transcriptional gene
regulatory events are critical for mediating LH follicular responses and among all non-ribosomal RNA isoforms,
circular RNA (circRNA) are the most abundantly expressed form of RNA, yet remain the least studied.
Functionally, circRNA can act as miRNA sponges, protein sponges/decoys, regulators of transcription and
translation. The role of circRNA in context to ovarian follicular development is relatively unknown, although
their presence is known and our recent RNA sequencing studies of ovarian granulosa cells before and after the
LH surge indicates the significant upregulation of circRNA, some of which have probable roles in preovulatory
follicular development. Uniquely, KHDRBS1 (KH RNA Binding Domain Containing, Signal Transduction
Associated 1) RNA element binding sites were identified in a large proportion of these LH-induced circRNA
granulosa cell transcripts. KHDRBS1 is a recognized RNA binding protein with circRNA biogenic activity in
other tissues and our preliminary results indicate high expression in ovarian granulosa cells. Moreover, global
Khdrbs1 knockout female mice were reported to be severely sub-fertile. In this proposal, we will test the
hypothesis that KHDRBS1 is a key regulator of LH induced circRNA biogenesis and of periovulatory events
associated with ovulation. To investigate this hypothesis the following aims are proposed 1) Examine effect
granulosa cell-specific KHDRBS1 loss has on LH-regulated circRNA biogenesis and fertility and 2)
Examine LH-regulated circRNA molecular mechanism(s) of action and their functional impact on
periovulatory follicular events. Aim 1 will use a granulosa cell-specific Khdrbs1 knockout mice (Khdrbs1fl/fl
:Aromatase cre) female mice to address the role of this protein in circRNA biogenesis and its impact on fertility.
In Aim 2, a complete functional analysis of several LH-regulated circRNA will be completed, to elucidate their
mechanisms of action and whether these unique RNA molecules have roles in LH mediated events such as
cumulus expansion, oocyte maturation, ovulation and luteinization. Studies in other systems indicate that
circRNA are important modulators of cell differentiation and abnormal expression of circRNA has been
associated with female reproductive diseases (i.e., primary ovarian insufficiency and polycystic ovarian
syndrome)."
10811465,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Antibodies are critical mediators of immune protection against pathogens, simultaneously acting to neutralize
entry and activate innate immune cells through interaction between the antibody Fc domain and Fc-receptors
(FcRs) on innate immune cells. Leveraging Fc-mediated activation in monoclonal antibody-based therapies is
increasingly being investigated for the treatment of infectious diseases but the precise mechanisms and breadth
of functions that can be induced by range of FcR-bearing immune cells is still unclear. However, these efforts
are limited by the fact that we do not fully understand the spectrum of effector functions and effector programs
that are induced via different FcRs, which could greatly impact efficacy and safety of mAb-based therapeutics.
Moreover, as some innate immune cells such as monocytes express multiple FcRs, understanding how these
pathways interact will help in the development of rational antibody design strategies to effectively harness innate
immune cells against a variety of pathogens.
 There are four activating FcRs that bind IgG and are expressed on innate immune cells (FcγR1, FcγR2A,
FcγR3A, and FcγR3B) and one inhibitory receptor (FcγR2B). The interplay between these receptors can impact
Fc-effector functions, especially in monocytes that express multiple FcRs. Moreover, antibody-mediated
activation of non-classical monocytes that express 3 activating FcγRs must balance protection and pathology,
as antibody-dependent enhancement of infection/disease has been observed in some contexts. Thus, defining
the transcriptional profiles of FcR-mediated activation of will be critical to better predict in vivo activity of
immunotherapies and antibodies induced by vaccination or infection. To that end, we propose to begin to
generate an ‘FcR Effector Atlas’ that defines the anti-pathogen pathways that are induced in distinct innate
immune cell types mediated by different FcRs. The Atlas can be used to map the pathways induced across all
innate immune cells to help guide development of optimally efficacious and safe antibody therapeutics against
infectious diseases.
 By combining Fc-engineered antibodies that facilitate individual or combinatorial activation of specific FcRs
and nascent transcriptomics, the goal of this proposal is pioneer an approach to generate the Atlas in
nonclassical monocytes. We will use SARS-CoV-2-specfic Fc-engineered monoclonal antibodies as a model
system to specifically engage different FcRs on monocytes to define the FcR-mediated transcriptional network
using capped small RNA-sequencing (csRNA-seq) that enables transcriptional profiling of nascent RNA
transcriptional start sites. Further, we will functionally link induction of specific pathways to restriction of SARS-
CoV-2 infection. Together, the approaches and results generated from this proposal will contribute to our
fundamental understanding of how antibodies leverage innate immunity and can be used to guide development
of highly effective and safe immunotherapeutics for infectious diseases and beyond."

QUANTITATIVE TOOL FOR DERMAL PHYSIOLOGICALLY-BASED
PHARMACOKINETIC (PBPK) MODELING
Project Summary
Topical drug products applied to skin undergo substantial metamorphosis as they are rubbed into
the application site: volatile excipients like water or alcohols evaporate, and drug and excipients
absorb into the skin. The result is a residual film on the skin surface that has quite different
composition and properties to the starting formulation that “came out of the tube”. Because the
residence time of the residual film is typically much longer than the period during which
metamorphosis occurs, drug delivery into the skin will be controlled both by the complex physical
chemistry of the metamorphosis (i.e., the kinetics and thermodynamics) and by the nature of the
residual film. In addition, excipients and solvents may alter drug partitioning into and diffusivity in the
skin and therefore impact directly on percutaneous permeation.
The objective of this work is to expand the capabilities of an existing physiologically based
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model simulating drug absorption and disposition in the skin to include
metamorphosis of the drug product during and following skin application together with
measurements of key formulation characteristics (quality attributes). The project will utilize
experimental data, both new and from the literature, to test the hypothesis that a PBPK model that
accounts correctly for metamorphosis kinetics, for relevant quality attributes of the starting product
and residual film, and for the impact of excipients and co-solvents on skin absorption, will correctly
predict dermal absorption and will support the bioequivalence assessment of generic topical drug
products.
A systematic series of increasingly complex drug products will be characterized in terms of quality
attributes that have a significant impact on drug absorption by affecting (a) the kinetics and
mechanism of metamorphosis, (b) drug thermodynamic activity as the product evolves to form the
residual film, and (c) skin absorption of formulation excipients and co-solvents that change drug
partitioning and diffusivity in the skin. A new generation of dermal PBPK models will be developed
with expanded, mechanistically based capabilities accounting for product metamorphosis and the
impact of quality attributes on drug delivery. These models will be validated by comparisons with in
vitro and/or in vivo skin permeation measurements of topical drug products collected as part of this
project and from the literature. The resulting enhanced PBPK models will be useful tools for
assessing the likelihood that different dermatological drug products are or are not bioequivalent
based on minimal clinical data, thereby reducing the time and cost to approve new drug products
applied to skin."
10932999,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Somatic mutations accumulate over time in every healthy cell, and these mutations have long been
hypothesized to be an important contributor to aging. However, many unknowns remain about this fundamental
process of aging because only recently have ultra-high fidelity sequencing technologies become available that
can detect somatic mutations in bulk poly-clonal samples of healthy cells, such as blood. For example, it is
entirely unknown how widely aging-related somatic mutation rates (SMRs) vary among individuals in
the population, whether SMRs predict mortality and aging-related disease, whether genetic or
environmental modifiers may cause outlier SMRs, and whether SMRs are associated with epigenetic
aging of the genome. Notably, no study to date has measured SMRs in large numbers of individuals, and no
study has measured SMRs with associated individual health, lifestyle, and exposure data. The Women’s
Health Initiative and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort are longitudinal studies that present a
unique opportunity to study the variability, modifiers, and mechanisms of SMRs in the human population.
These cohorts’ > 20 years of longitudinal data and blood samples from > 20 years ago enable this
proposal’s first large-scale measurements of SMRs in the human population and the first
measurements of SMRs in combination with detailed human health data. Here, we will perform ultra-high
fidelity profiling of SMRs and mutational patterns in the blood of 3,000 individuals from these cohorts, which is
almost an order of magnitude more individuals than all prior SMR studies combined. This study will directly test
several fundamental open questions and hypotheses about SMRs, including how widely SMRs and mutational
patterns vary among individuals, whether SMRs vary between sexes, whether there are outlier individuals in
the population with identifiable causes for their higher or lower SMR, and whether SMR predicts mortality and
aging-related disease. Since prior studies suggest that deamination of methylated cytosines is a significant
contributor to SMRs, we will also perform the first joint SMR and methylation profiling of the same individuals to
assess the mechanistic relationship between genetic and epigenetic aging of the genome. Apart from
achieving the first population-level characterization of SMRs and an improved mechanistic understanding of
SMRs, this study may establish SMRs as a novel, clinically useful biomarker for healthy aging. As the
population ages and the prevalence of aging-related diseases increases, our study may motivate the use of
SMRs as a biomarker for predicting aging-related disease risk, potentially enabling early preventive clinical
interventions. This study will further establish a scalable approach for studying SMRs—which reflect the
cumulative effect of endogenous and exogenous mutagens over the lifespan—in large cohorts, with potential
for significant impact on our understanding of human health and aging."

Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid that has myriad uses in the cell. Aside from direct
incorporation into protein, glutamine can be metabolized to generate nucleotides, other amino acids, the Krebs
cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate (αKG) which is important for energy production and anabolic reactions, and
glutathione (GSH) to protect against oxidative stress. We recently determined that αKG and GSH are
particularly important glutamine derived metabolites that are required at distinct stages of osteoblast
differentiation. For example, our data indicates that αKG is required early in skeletal stem and progenitor cells
to regulate proliferation and osteoblast specification. GSH is required later in specified pre-osteoblasts to
govern osteoblast differentiation by neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistically, how αKG and
ROS regulate proliferation, specification and differentiation remains enigmatic. Moreover, the enzymes that
generate αKG from glutamine in osteoblasts have not been described. In this proposal, we will 1) establish the
necessity of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 2 (GOT2) dependent αKG synthesis to regulate osteoblast
differentiation and bone formation, 2) define the contribution of αKG to osteoblast energetics and intermediate
metabolism, 3) elucidate the molecular regulation of osteoblast differentiation by ROS, and 4) evaluate the
efficacy of antioxidants to rescue bone formation in a mouse model of human cleidocranial dysplasia. Our
findings will have broad implications in bone development, maintenance of bone mass, skeletal repair and
regeneration."

More than two million Americans have undergone bariatric surgery over the last decade; given the obesity
epidemic, this number will continue to rise. Since 2018 of the ~ 250,000 yearly bariatric procedures performed
in the United States, 72% are sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and 21% Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Although
these surgeries provide the most successful long-term treatment for obesity, they double the risk of developing
alcohol use disorders (AUD). The precise mechanism(s) underlying an increase AUD risk is uncertain, but in
our previous NIH-funded research in women who underwent these surgeries (AA024103), we demonstrated
that both SG and RYGB cause profound changes in alcohol pharmacokinetics (PK) and sensitivity to the
subjective effects of alcohol; both of which can increase AUD risk. RYGB and SG doubled peak blood alcohol
concentrations when consuming the same dose as before surgery. By studying PK after SG, we also help
clarify that most alcohol first-pass metabolism (FPM) occurs in the stomach, not the liver (at least in women),
providing a plausible mechanism for increased alcohol-related liver disease and AUD after surgeries that
reduce the stomach. In people who did not undergo SG/RYGB, drinking alcohol with a meal increases FPM
and the alcohol elimination rate (AER), thus reducing alcohol bioavailability and intoxication. However, the
effects of food on alcohol PK after SG are unknown. SG alters nutrient absorption leading to earlier and higher
glycemic peaks concomitant with exaggerated postprandial insulin rises that can trigger postprandial
hypoglycemia. Because alcohol inhibits gluconeogenesis, we posit that drinking alcohol with food will increase
the risk for hypoglycemia after SG. In addition, there are remarkable sex-related differences in alcohol PK, but
previous bariatric studies included only women or very few men to determine sex differences. Therefore, the
primary goal of the proposed study is to determine sex-related differences in the impact of SG on the PK (Aim
1), subjective effects (Aim 2), and glycemic effects (Aim 3) in the fasted versus prandial state when alcohol is
ingested or given intravenously clamped (the gold standard to measure AER and acute alcohol tolerance). We
will use a cross-sectional study to compare participants who underwent SG surgery 1-5 years ago with
matched non-operated controls (both sexes). Our main hypotheses are that compared to controls, in the SG
group, food will 1) increase less FPM (particularly in men) and decrease less the sedative effects of ingested
alcohol, 2) amplify alcohol-hypoglycemia and acute tolerance to the sedative effects when alcohol is given IV
(in the clamp). This project will answer the questions of whether there are sex-related differences in the impact
of SG on alcohol’s PK and pharmacologic effects, whether drinking alcohol with a meal is effective or
counterproductive post-SG (considering risk for hypoglycemia) and clarify the site of FPM in men. Findings
from this study will contribute to evidence-based recommendations on the impact of SG on alcohol-related
toxic effects and could help expand the knowledge base of sex-related differences in human alcohol PK."
10801350,"Project Abstract (Summary)
Medically underserved populations are disproportionately affected by screen-preventable cancers, such as
colorectal cancer (CRC). Entities such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the American
Cancer Society recommend fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) as an effective home-based method for CRC
screening. Annual FIT, when followed by a diagnostic colonoscopy for a positive result, can reduce CRC
mortality on a population level. CRC screening is traditionally delivered as part of a medical visit. However, due
to short visit times and competing demands among providers and patients alike, patients, even those who
regularly attend medical visits, may miss out on screening, putting them at a higher risk of serious disease.
FITs can be easily distributed in non-traditional healthcare settings and can help bridge the gap in care for
underserved populations. Community pharmacies hold promise as a site for CRC screening because of their
accessibility and pharmacists’ expanding role in delivering preventive services. Based on our formative and
pilot work demonstrating the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of FIT delivery in
pharmacies, our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of a pharmacy-based FIT
intervention called PharmFIT. Through collaboration with community partners such as the North Carolina
Network Consortium (NCNC), the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho Practice Research
Network (WPRN) and the Community Pharmacy Enhanced Services Network (CPESN), our aims are to: 1)
evaluate the impact, 2) assess the implementation, and 3) estimate the costs of the PharmFIT intervention. We
will conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of PharmFIT on CRC screening rates in eligible
primary care patients who are not up to date. Patients will be individually randomized to a usual care arm or a
PharmFIT arm and we will determine whether there are statistically significant differences in CRC screening
rates. Concurrently, we will use a mixed-method approach to assess a range of preliminary implementation
outcomes and identify barriers and facilitators (i.e., determinants) of those implementation outcomes. Finally,
we will calculate the cost of PharmFIT using collaborative process flow diagramming to inform micro-costing
and budget impact analysis. We hypothesize that the PharmFIT intervention will increase CRC screening
uptake over usual care by providing better access and more opportunities for preventive services through a
collaborative pharmacy/primary care approach."

Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for many hospital- and community-associated infections worldwide.
However, therapeutic options to combat these infections are limited due to the high level of antibiotic resistance
and lack of effective vaccines. Thus, there is a significant need for the development of effective therapeutics
against this bacterium. Critical to the pathogenesis of S. aureus is the killing of phagocytes, innate immune cells
integral to the control of Staphylococcal infections. The long-term goal of this research program is to understand
the mechanism employed by S. aureus to injure these critical immune cells. We have discovered that the
leukocidin A/B (LukAB) plays an essential role in protecting S. aureus from phagocyte-mediated killing by
targeting and eliminating these cells. LukAB is chromosomally encoded and found in most clinical strains yet is
the most divergent pore-forming toxin. LukAB: is responsible for S. aureus-mediated demise of primary human
phagocytes during ex vivo infections; binds host proteins CD11b and HVCN1; exhibits species specificity by
preferentially targeting the human CD11b and HVCN1 over the murine proteins; is produced in vivo during both
murine and human infections; and is responsible for killing human leukocytes from both the extracellular milieu
as well as intracellularly in the phagosome when produced by S. aureus. The primary goals of this competitive
renewal application are to: define the molecular mechanism(s) by which LukAB kills human phagocytes (Aim 1),
disentangle the regulatory network involved in lukAB expression (Aim 2), and delineate the contribution of LukAB
to S. aureus pathogenesis in vivo (Aim 3). To accomplish these Aims, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach
that combines techniques from bacteriology, biochemistry, cell biology, immunology, and pathogenesis, together
with ex vivo and in vivo infection models. Completion of these studies will provide much needed fundamental
insight into how LukAB contributes to the pathogenesis of S. aureus."

 G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways mediate actions of hormones and
neurotransmitters. They are essential for normal function of the nervous system, frequently disrupted in many
neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions and/or exploited for therapeutic purposes. While we learned
considerable information about molecular players involved in traditional GPCR signaling, many critical gaps
remain. Among biggest uncharted territories in the field is an issue of “orphan” GPCRs, receptors with
unknown signaling mechanisms. It is generally recognized that orphan receptors have tremendous potential for
uncovering novel biology of the nervous system and harnessing it for potential therapeutic benefits. Our long-
term goal is to understand principles in organization and functional regulation of poorly explored GPCR
pathways in the effort to develop better treatments for brain disorders.
 The focus of our attention is on poorly understood orphan receptor- GPR158, yet one of the most
abundant GPCRs in the brain. We found that GPR158 plays a pivotal role in stress-induced depression. Its
expression is induced by glucocorticoids and is upregulated in patients with major depressive disorder.
Conversely, GPR158 elimination in mice produces marked anti-depressant phenotype and stress resilience. At
the molecular level, GPR158 recruits negative regulator of G protein signaling, RGS7 to the plasma membrane
impacting production of the second messenger cAMP to control synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability.
The proposal is focused on filling two biggest gaps in our understanding of GPR158 biology: its activation
mechanisms and identity of effectors mediating its effects on neuronal circuitry underlying affective states.
Intriguingly, our Preliminary Data revealed network of GPR158 extracellular interactions with the cell-
adhesion like proteins and pointed to a cAMP-modulated K+ channel complex as a possible signaling mediator.
 Based on accumulated preliminary data we hypothesize that GPR158 transduces signals triggered by
extracellular binding partners into changes of neuronal excitability by engaging inhibitory ion channel complex.
This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three complementary Specific Aims that seek to: (1) determine
molecular mechanisms by which GPR158 transduces its signals, (2) dissect circuits that rely on GPR158
action to exert behavioral effects and (3) probe the involvement of the K+ channel complex in mediating the
effect of GPR158 on neuronal excitability. The strategy proposed to address these Aims will entail a synergistic
combination of biochemical, electrophysiological and cell-biological approaches, exploiting the existence of a
powerful array of technologies and animal models. We hope that accomplishment of these goals will provide
critical new insights into the mood regulation in mammals and suggest novel targets for the development of
therapeutic interventions."

 In recent decades, Mongolia has experienced major economic and environmental changes, and suffered
from severe air pollution. Ulaanbaatar (UB) and Darkhan City (DC) have some of the highest ambient particulate
matter (PM) concentrations in the world and frequently suffer epidemics of viral respiratory diseases. The
associations between PM exposure and cardiorespiratory mortality and morbidity have been well documented,
with an established 6.67 million premature deaths globally attributed to air pollution in 2019. Recently, attention
has increased regarding the association of PM pollution and respiratory viral infection. Hence, this U01 proposal,
as part of the Mongolian GEOHealth Hub program, focuses on studying the relationships and interactions
between PM exposure and respiratory viral infections. The U01 project consists of a main study and two pilot
studies to begin Center activities. The main project is designed to test the hypothesis that PM exposure weakens
the immune defense against respiratory viral infection. It has three interconnected specific aims. Aim 1 is to
characterize the relationship between PM exposure and respiratory viral infection through a time-series analysis
of weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) rates in association with PM levels within and across UB and DC, adjusting
for potential confounders and co-pollutants. As an air pollution control measure, UB started the implementation
of processed coal use in May, 2019, whereas DC continues to use raw coal. Nesting this policy intervention into
the time-series analysis strengthens the causal inference of the PM-ILI association derived from natural
variabilities over time. Aim 2 is to examine immunologic and viral responses to personal PM exposure through
two parallel panel studies in residents of UB and DC, respectively. Each panel consists of 100-120 nonsmoking
adults who will be measured semiannually during a 3-year follow-up period. ILI counts and immunologic
biomarkers will be associated with personal PM exposures. Aim 3 is to define the direct effects of PM exposure
on epithelial integrity and immune signaling and the subsequent impact on anti-viral responses. This will be
achieved through cell culture studies that are directly linked to Aim 2 subjects (as cell donors). The two pilot
studies, built upon the Aim 2 main study, aim to explore the effects of PM on pulmonary tuberculosis and bone
mineral loss, respectively. These studies are motivated by high prevalence of both tuberculosis and osteoporosis
in Mongolia and by emerging evidence suggesting PM or heavy metals in PM as risk factors. This U01 proposal
is an interdisciplinary research project involving researchers in epidemiology, toxicology, environmental and
occupational health, exposure science, biostatistics, virology, immunology, environmental engineering,
respiratory medicine, and infectious disease from multiple institutions in Mongolia, Duke University, and Duke
Kunshan University. The U01 research is designed to be the initial main platform for engaging U2R Fellows
(trainees) and Faculty (mentors) in research and training.

10806244,"Project Summary/Abstract: Arsenic is the most pervasive toxin, considered by the EPA to be one the
most significant potential environmental threats to human health. Arsenic exposure is a cause of cancer, heart
disease, childhood developmental delay, and disrupts the human microbiome. Our research program
blossomed during the current funding period of our NIGMS grant, focusing on arsenic transporters
and biotransformations, which modify its availability, speciation, mobility and toxicity. We are uniquely
qualified for this project: over the lifetime of this grant, my group identified and characterized the majority of
ars genes/proteins involved in arsenic transport, biotransformations and resistance and their impact on the
global arsenic biogeocycle. We discovered enzymes of the arsenic methylation cycle and elucidated
mechanisms and structures of the enzymes of biotransformation, developed biosensors for
organoarsenicals herbicides and discovered organoarsenicals with the potential to be novel antimicrobial
agents. My goals for the next five years fall into four categories. 1) Structure/function analysis of enzymes
of arsenic biotransformations. We will elucidate the catalytic cycle of the ArsM arsenite S-
adenosylmethione (SAM) methyltransferase, the ArsH methylarsenite oxidases, the ArsI C-As bond lyases
and the ArsN N-acetyltransferase through biochemical and structural analysis. 2) Regulation and biosensing.
We will determine the structural details of metalloregulation. We will devise new applications for sensing
environmental organoarsenical pollutants. 3) Arsenic transporters; we identified a number of new permeases
for organoarsenicals and will determine the mechanism of transport by a combination of molecular genetics,
biochemistry and crystallography. 4) Arsenical antibiotics; we recently identified two organoarsenical natural
products with antibiotic activity. We will determine the pathways of synthesis and mode of action of
these novel compounds and discover new natural products with potential health applications. My overall
vision is a research program of sufficient breadth to encompass identification of the physiological roles of
known arsenic resistance genes and sufficient depth to elucidate their molecular mechanisms. Microbial
genomes have many uncharacterized arsenic-related genes. There are predicted permeases and enzymes
with no known substrate or function. We predict these are involved in arsenical transport or biotransformations.
We will mine microbial genomes for new ars genes, deduce their evolutionary histories and determine how they
affect cycling of environmental arsenicals. We will discover their physiological functions. Their protein
products will be purified and characterized by biochemical and structural analyses. My overarching theme is
to make substantial contributions to understanding of the global arsenic biogeocycle and its impact on
human health."
10806245,"Abstract
The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created disruptions in usual medical care delivery for
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) across the U.S. that could have devastating downstream
effects long after COVID-19 is controlled. COVID’s “spillover” could manifest via delays in presentation,
disruptions to acute care, deferral of usual outpatient care, and negative health effects of economic conditions
and worsening social risk.
Older adults living in rural areas experience worse CVD outcomes than their urban counterparts, and may be
particularly vulnerable to each of these spillover effects, particularly if they also live in poverty or are members
of racial or ethnic minority groups. Rural older adults may also have less access to potential mitigation
strategies, such as inpatient and outpatient telehealth, restarting elective procedures under new precautions,
and reaching out to patients proactively to manage chronic disease. However, because the rural population is
smaller, and less-often included in commercial and health system databases, this group is understudied. It is
crucial to understand COVID spillover in rural areas in order to counteract it.
The central premise of this proposal is that understanding the magnitude of COVID’s spillover effects on CVD
in rural areas, as well as the impact of key mitigation strategies, will enable us to deal with future waves of this
pandemic, with other outbreaks in the future, and with challenges to rural care delivery more broadly. We will
use national Medicare claims data, which allows us near-complete, long-term capture of clinical care and
outcomes for roughly 70% of older adults in the US, to achieve three Aims:
Aim 1: Quantify COVID spillover effects on a monthly basis in the first 12 months of the pandemic, and
characterize the use of spillover mitigation strategies, among rural compared to urban areas.
Aim 2: Quantify the short- and long-term clinical effects of delay and disruption of acute care in rural versus
urban areas, and determine if mitigation strategies reduced negative impacts of spillover.
Aim 3: Quantify the short- and long-term clinical effects of deferral of chronic care and worsening social risk in
rural versus urban areas, and determine if mitigation strategies reduced negative impacts of spillover.
The proposed work will provide national estimates of how COVID spillover and its mitigation strategies were
associated with clinical cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes among older rural adults, and allow
successful strategies to be deployed in the future. It will also quantify whether access to these strategies was
equitable among rural individuals living in poverty or those who identify as racial or ethnic minorities, enabling
future efforts to monitor and achieve equity goals."

Accumulating neuropathological and animal studies suggest that AD pathology impacts brain microstructure
years before clinical manifestation of the disease. Various processes involved including alterations in dendritic
arborization and spines, neurite morphology, synaptic density, and axonal transport and packing. Until recently,
the evaluation of these microstructural properties and their association with AD pathology has been mainly
limited to postmortem tissue. Recent advances in MRI techniques have provided us with the ability to measure
cortical and white matter microstructural properties such as neurite morphology and macromolecular tissue
content in human in vivo. In the proposed study, we will employ a set of advanced quantitative MRI sequences
and analytical approaches to measure changes in cortical and white matter neurite morphology and
macromolecular content in preclinical AD and will examine their association with cognitive outcomes, and
amyloid and tau pathology measured by PET. We have recently demonstrated the utility of these measures in
detecting alterations in cortical and white matter neurite and macromolecular content in a sample of healthy
older adults and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. We have also tested the association
between these measures and AD pathology in a small sample of older adults with confirmed AD pathology.
Teaming up with experts in early AD characterization and AD pathology and leveraging Stanford ADRC PET-
MR and deep phenotyping resources, we will study the following aims on a sample of 120 older adults who
have a clinical consensus diagnosis of either cognitively normal controls (HC) or mild cognitive impairment
(MCI), and will be confirmed to be Aβ- or Aβ+ based on ADRC amyloid PET data. We will examine cross-
sectional and longitudinal changes in cortical microstructural properties including neurite density (NDI) and
orientation dispersion index (ODI) (Aim 1), and in white matter microstructural and macromolecular tissue
properties including NDI, ODI and macromolecular tissue volume (MTV) (Aim 2), along with their association
with cognitive outcomes and AD pathology identified by PET. Taking a network-neuroscience approach, we will
also examine connectome-level microstructural changes in preclinical AD and will test the utility of a multi-layer
network framework for integrating measures across modalities (microstructural, molecular, PET, cognition) to
capture the heterogeneity of AD. The proposed systematic investigation of microstructural and molecular
changes in cortical and white matter in preclinical AD and their association with AD pathology and cognitive
outcomes in a well-characterized preclinical AD sample can provide unique insight regarding AD development
in early stages of the disease and can significantly improve our mechanistic understanding of AD. The
outcomes also have the potential to inform development of experimental treatments, monitoring their
effectiveness, and predicting cognitive and clinical trajectories of preclinical AD patients."

Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer mortality, yet few breast cancer drugs effectively inhibit metastasis.
Breast cancer cells use collective migration to remodel and align surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) fibrils,
which facilitates invasion. Aligned tumor stroma topography can induce cluster budding and dissemination of
breast cancer cells. The goal of this project is to identify chemotherapeutic drugs using engineered biomimetic
tumor invasion models and to evaluate therapeutic feasibility of inhibiting the target genes involved in breast
cancer dissemination. To achieve this goal, we developed a quasi-3D nanotopographically patterned substrate
and are incorporating it into a nanopatterned impedance electrode array (nanoIEA) to quantify collective cell
migration and proliferation in real-time at high-throughput. We are validating a 3D aligned collagen fiber hydrogel
model with control over fiber alignment that recapitulates the fiber dimension and orientation of in vivo breast
tumor stroma. These models markedly promote breast cancer cluster dissemination and increase its resistance
to chemotherapy. In our preliminary study, we have identified differentially expressed genes via RNA-seq
between ‘disseminated tumor cell clusters’ and ‘non-disseminated tumor cells’ using the quasi-3D model. We
will pursue three aims that leverage our expertise in cancer molecular biology/genomics (Ahn), tissue
engineering (Kim), machine learning (ML)-based image analysis (Lee), cancer organoids/metastasis (Ewald),
and pharmacology/drug development (Liu). Human breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell
clusters/organoids will be investigated in this project. In Aim 1, we will evaluate effects of the following drugs on
collective cell migration and on growth using the nanoIEA: [a] the 23 oncology drugs (out of 147 drugs we tested)
which most significantly inhibited the viability of breast cancer cells in the quasi-3D model, [b] the 73 non-
oncology drugs which inhibited the viability of 22 breast cancer cell lines by at least 4-fold in conventional 2D
culture, and [c] the 95 inhibitors of target genes (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1). In Aim 2, we will characterize
phenotypic responses of breast cancer cells/organoids to the identified drug candidates from Aim 1 using live
cell microscopy and ML analyses. Phenotypic changes (e.g., motility, morphology) will be quantified to contrast
subpopulations (non-invasive vs. invasive) and drug-treated cells vs. untreated. In Aim 3, we will evaluate
therapeutic feasibility of regulating the target genes to inhibit cancer invasion. We will determine expressions of
target genes at protein levels in PDX organoids, then correlate these with organoid invasiveness in the 3D model.
We will then determine how inhibition of the target genes influences chemosensitivity of PDX organoids and
suppresses their invasiveness. This project will increase our understanding of the mechanisms of topography-
induced breast cancer dissemination and establish our tumor ECM-mimetics, nanoIEA, and ML imaging analysis
as a preclinical cancer invasion model/assay to characterize heterogenous cell populations with different
metastatic phenotypes and to identify chemotherapeutic agents that directly inhibit breast cancer invasion."
10804153,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We seek to define immunologic and transcriptomic signatures of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)
pulmonary disease and microbiologic treatment response. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are
environmental pathogens that is present in the soil and water. MAC is the most common cause of NTM
pulmonary disease, causing chronic, debilitating disease in predominantly older patients with underlying lung
disease. Prior work has illustrated that incidence rates of MAC pulmonary disease are increasing substantially,
particularly among women. Currently, the role of the host response in the development of disease is not well
described. Treatment, when necessary, consists of 3-4 antibiotics for 18+ months. There is an urgent need to fill
the critical gaps in knowledge of factors associated with disease burden and treatment response. Our lack of
understanding poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. First, it is often difficult to discern
colonization vs. disease caused by these organisms, and second it is difficult to predict who will benefit from
therapy, or who will remain disease-free after therapy completion. There is a need for non-invasive biomarkers
of disease burden and treatment response, to limit exposure to computed tomography scan radiation that is
currently used to monitor disease along with acid-fast sputum culture and patient-reported symptoms. Based on
M. tuberculosis literature coupled with observations of NTM disease in the setting of anti-tumor necrosis factor
therapy, the Th1 response could explain NTM pulmonary disease pathogenesis in some patients.
This prospective biobank enrolls patients in a sub-study of our ongoing MAC2v3 pragmatic clinical trial, as well
as others who meet American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America clinical, radiographic, and
microbiologic disease criteria and are starting treatment for MAC pulmonary disease. This builds on our existing
NTM Clinical Trials Network infrastructure and extensive experience developing and managing the Northwest
NTM Biobank. The Biobank has supported collaborations between MPIs Drs. Winthrop and Lewinsohn to
conduct preliminary feasibility studies of immune correlates of disease. MPIs Drs. Lewinsohn and McWeeney
have a longstanding history of collaboration. During Years 1-4, we will collect blood and sputum samples
longitudinally from patients initiating treatment for MAC pulmonary disease and conduct Aims 1A and 2A. During
Years 3-5 we will complete Aims 1 and 2. In this setting we will conduct high throughput cytometry time-of-flight
(CyTOF) analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to identify an immune signature of disease and
microbiologic treatment response. Similarly, we will conduct whole blood next generation RNA sequencing to
identify an RNA transcriptome signature of disease and microbiologic treatment response. Ultimately, the
development of a disease signature and biomarkers predictive of treatment response could help better guide
therapeutic and diagnostic decision-making with regard to MAC pulmonary disease."

Despite being a natural physiological process, menstruation is often associated with health and safety
challenges, especially in low-resource settings. In Nepal, 90% of women and girls follow at least one menstrual
restriction. The most extreme is chhaupadi, a social-religious tradition in which women live in isolation during
menstruation, exposing them to harmful health consequences. There is a dearth of evidence regarding effective
approaches to address chhaupadi, which remains widespread. Research: This community-engaged study aims
to rigorously review extant intervention evidence, as well as co-design and pilot a culturally relevant chhaupadi
intervention to ultimately improve women’s health in Nepal. The study aims are as follows: Aim 1 - Conduct a
Realist Synthesis to elucidate the mechanisms of success or failure of chhaupadi interventions to date, including
key-informant interviews (KIIs) (n=35). Aim 2 - Co-design a chhaupadi intervention with women (n=30) in three
districts using participatory, human-centered design activities. The intervention will be refined via community
meetings (n=6) and KIIs (n=25). Aim 3 - Pilot test the intervention in two matched communities (intervention and
control, n=45). Surveys with standardized measures and focus group discussions (n=6) will be conducted to
assess feasibility, acceptability, and changes in health attitudes and behaviors expected to be impacted by the
intervention. Candidate: Dr. Sara Baumann is an Assistant Professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of
Public Health, Department of Behavioral and Community Health Sciences with extensive previous training in
community-engaged research and women’s reproductive health in Nepal. Training: Four training goals will
support Dr. Baumann’s trajectory toward becoming an independent investigator: 1) Acquire skills in Realist
Synthesis to identify underlying causal mechanisms and reasons for intervention success or failure; 2) develop
expertise in intervention development and assessment, as well as implementation science; 3) attain new skills
in clinical trial design applicable to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); and 4) gain essential skills in
leadership, mentorship, grant writing, and study management. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Baumann will be
supported by an exceptional team of international and multidisciplinary experts including a diverse mentorship
team, advisory board, consultants, and collaborating organizations in Nepal. Her mentorship team has expertise
in essential content and methodological areas such as intervention development, evaluation, clinical trials, and
statistical analyses. Her comprehensive career development plan includes substantial mentorship, didactic
training, and experiential learning at the University of Pittsburgh (US) and Tribhuvan University (Nepal). By
successfully completing these rigorous career development and research plans, Dr. Baumann will be fully
prepared to transition into a successful independent global health researcher and interventionist who harnesses
community-engaged approaches to improve women’s reproductive health in LMICs."

 During development, cells adhere to specific partners in precise arrangements to build well-ordered
structures. Nowhere is this more impressive than in the brain, which has the most diverse cell types with
the most elaborate morphologies and most highly specific connectivity of any organ. While extensive
work has been done to identify mechanisms of partner selection among neurons, far less is known about
neuron-glia pairing. Glia extend membranous processes that intimately wrap specific synapses, affecting
synapse growth and pruning, and modulating synapse strength during learning. Defects in glia-neuron
interactions are associated with a host of neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, understanding how
specific neuron-glia attachments are determined will shed light on a key aspect of brain wiring, and will
reveal general principles by which cells select specific adhesion partners during development.
 This project uses a single defined neuron-glia attachment as a model to identify the developmental
and genetic mechanisms that underlie neuron-glia pairing. It focuses on a single C. elegans sensory
neuron, called URX, that forms membranous attachments to a specific glial partner, the lateral ILso glial
cell. Highly cell-type-specific drivers allow this single, defined neuron-glia contact to be visualized or
genetically manipulated in live intact animals. Preliminary data show that this specific neuron-glia
attachment arises in embryos by a multi-step developmental process. First, the URX dendrite anchors to
a 'guidepost' glial cell during embryo elongation, positioning the dendrite ending at the nose tip. Then, a
sensory cilium grows out of the dendrite tip to form the elaborate attachment to the ILso glial partner.
 This project will investigate:
 Aim 1. How does the dendrite anchor to the guidepost cell? Preliminary data suggest that epithelial
adherens junctions are modified to create the anchoring site.
 Aim 2. How does the sensory cilium mediate neuron-glia adhesion? Preliminary genetic screens
have identified several mutants that disrupt cilia adhesion, including one that affects a proteoglycan with
homology to a protein that mediates glia-synapse interactions in mammalian brain.
 Aim 3. What is the function of this highly specific neuron-glia attachment? Preliminary work indicates
that the attachment undergoes experience-dependent remodeling, suggesting a mechanism by which
glia could tune the sensitivity of the neuron by altering the physical structure of its receptive ending."

Alcoholic ketoacidosis is a metabolic complication caused by chronic/binge alcohol drinking in a state of poor
nutrition. Chronic alcohol use depletes glycogen stores in the liver and impairs gluconeogenesis, causing
decreased glucose availability and increased reliance on fatty acid breakdown. This also alters
counterregulatory hormone balance that further increases free fatty acid breakdown and ketone production,
resulting in metabolic acidosis. The main features of alcoholic ketoacidosis are low blood bicarbonate levels,
high ketone bodies, and high anion gaps. Alcoholic ketoacidosis commonly causes tachycardia, agitation,
abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and it can lead to death, if untreated. This metabolic disorder was first
reported in 1940s and pathophysiological data were collected from patients taken several decades ago, which
helped to lay the foundation for the current understanding of its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management.
Nonetheless, our understanding of alcoholic ketoacidosis is presently limited and has many challenges. No
study has been conducted to test its cause and underlying mechanism. Understanding the mechanism is
essential for developing a strategy to reduce the risk of alcoholic ketoacidosis. In preliminary studies, we
successfully induced alcoholic ketoacidosis in mice by modifying the clinically relevant alcohol feeding protocol.
Mice fed chronic/binge alcohol under a fasting condition develop low blood bicarbonate levels, high β-
hydroxybutyrate, and a high anion gap, all of which are hallmarks for alcoholic ketoacidosis. These features do
not occur by chronic-plus-binge alone or fasting alone. With the development of an animal model exhibiting
alcoholic ketoacidosis, we are now in a great position to tackle this metabolic complication. The project has
three specific aims. Aim 1 will examine additional parameters related to alcoholic ketoacidosis and then focus
on testing whether the currently known causes (excessive alcohol use, poor nutrition, and dehydration) are
valid. Aim 2 will examine the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis. Our hypothesis is that acidosis is
induced not only by inadequate energy stores but also by downregulation of the pH-regulating protein NBCn1,
and that this acidosis stimulates alcohol consumption in a feedback process and subsequently exacerbates the
condition. The hypothesis will be tested by examining the effects of ketogenesis, decreased brain pH, and
NBCn1 knockdown in the brain regions associated with alcohol reward, on alcoholic ketoacidosis. Aim 3 will
test the NaHCO3-mediated intervention to reduce the risk of alcoholic ketoacidosis. The efficacy of sodium
bicarbonate for reducing alcoholic ketoacidosis, its effect on alcohol reward, and the protective role in alcohol-
induced liver injury will be investigated. The impact of the project is that the results will provide valuable
information on alcoholic ketoacidosis that has been challenging. The results will also lead to a new research
platform for the development of a non-prescription product that helps reduce excessive alcohol consumption
for chronic/binge drinkers who could be metabolically complicated with alcoholic ketoacidosis."

Female sexual function (FSF) refers to how desire, arousal, orgasm, pain, pleasure, and satisfaction are experienced by
women. Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is categorized into three DSM-5 diagnoses: sexual interest/arousal disorder,
female orgasmic disorder, and genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. Differentiating problems with FSF from FSD, the
morbidity criteria for FSD suggest there must be distress, symptom duration of at least six months, and experience of
dysfunction in 75% or more of sexual experiences. Approximately 40.9% of premenopausal women, and between 40-50%
of women regardless of menopausal status, experience FSD, which impacts subjective experiences of sex, increases
feelings of distress (e.g., sadness, guilt, anxiety), and reduces their overall quality of life. Incidences of specific types of
FSD include decreased desire (26.4-28.42% of premenopausal women), genital arousal (15.4-22.6%), lubrication of the
vagina (16.3-20.6%), orgasm (20.9-25.7%), and increased sexual pain (14.4-20.8%). Black women are an understudied
demographic within FSF/FSD research, despite research suggesting they find sex more important than women of other
races. The Heteronormativity Theory of Low Sexual Desire (HTLSD) asserts socio-structural factors such as
heteronormativity, expressed via romantic relationship dynamics, impact FSF, but Black women face the added
intersection of racism. Intersectionality suggests racism compounds the negative impact of heteronormative socio-
structural oppression on Black women’s sexual functioning. Notably, Black women's cultural values (e.g., collectivism)
may moderate how relationship factors influence FSF/FSD due to socio-structural oppression, thus romantic relationship
dyads are one area ripe for assessment and future intervention development. Aligned with PAR-21-281 (NIMHD and
Office of Women’s Health priorities), innovation is needed to accurately capture the dyadic process of how Black
women’s partners’ report of relationship factors (e.g., romantic gender roles and other variables related to the HTLSD)
influence Black women’s FSF/FSD. Additionally, as White women have been the focus of most US-based FSF/FSD
studies, examining the differential relationship predictors of FSF/FSD among Black and White women is an important
step toward racially specific FSF/FSD interventions. The Assessing Differential Dyadic Mechanisms of Black and
White Women’s SEXual FUNctioning (ADD SEX FUN) project will employ an intersectional adaptation of HTLSD,
using a Black feminist, comparative mixed-method, dyadic examination of relationship factors associated with Black and
White women's sexual functioning through actor-partner interdependence modeling (APIM). ADD SEX FUN will also
employ dyadic qualitative interviews (dyadic framework analysis, relation mapping) and focus groups to glean the lived
experience of Black women and their partners related to FSF/FSD, eliciting the key moments in their relationships that

Benzene is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant. Natural sources of benzene include gas
emissions from volcanos and forest fire. Benzene is also one of the top 20 chemicals generated
by industrial sources in the United States. While levels of benzene in the ambient air are usually
in low ppb range, amount of benzene in automobile exhaust and tobacco smoke can exceed 50
ppm, and occupational exposure to benzene can be as high as several hundred ppm. People
living near hazardous waste sites, gasoline refineries, petrochemical industries, and gasoline
fueling stations may also have high exposure to benzene. Emerging data suggest that benzene
can exert cardiovascular toxicity. Our preliminary studies show that exposure to benzene
exacerbates atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of most cardiovascular disease and stroke. In
vitro studies show that benzene metabolite t,t-muconaldehyde induces endothelial activation
(expression of adhesion molecules, leukocyte adhesion and their trans-endothelial migration, and
endothelial cell apoptosis). Using RNA-seq approach, we identified several molecular targets
(eNOS, SOD1, HO-1, COX-2, ATF3 etc.) by which benzene and its metabolites can exert adverse
effects on endothelial functions. We also observed that heat shock proteins HSPA1A and
HSPA1B induced by benzene exposure could play a protective role in benzene-induced
endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that
HSPA1A and HSPA1B prevent benzene-induced exacerbation of atherogenesis by inhibiting
vascular inflammation and injury. To test this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims: Aim 1
will examine how HSPA1A and HSPA1B affect benzene-induced endothelial functions (vascular
relaxation, leukocyte rolling and adhesion to vascular endothelium, apoptosis) and Aim 2 will
examine how endothelial cell specific overexpression of HSPA1A and HSPA1B affects benzene-
induced atherosclerosis (lesion size, composition and nature). Successful completion of this
project will establish a mechanistically validated model of benzene-induced endothelial
dysfunction and atherosclerosis. This will provide a strong rationale to examine the association of
benzene exposure with vascular dysfunctions and atherosclerosis in humans."

Opioids are commonly prescribed for a variety of acute and chronic pain states. Unfortunately,
prescribed opioids can be tampered with or diverted, both of which can have severe
consequences (e.g., lethal overdose). Tamper-resistant formulations have had limited success,
and cannot prevent diversion of drugs. Injectable formulations that can deposit an extended
course of treatment in the body would make diversion nearly impossible once administered, but
most, if stolen, can still be tampered with (and the opioid extracted) by relatively simple means.
Importantly, once administered to patients, they deliver drugs at a rate that does not change
with the varying needs of the patient. They are therefore unusable for acute pain: if opioids were
continuously released at a rate adequate for acute pain, patients would be narcotized for
extended periods. Here, we propose to develop depot formulations made of polymers which are
attached covalently to opioids by photolabile linkers. The depots would be injected
subcutaneously by healthcare providers, for example, prior to discharge after a procedure. The
covalent linkers would render the depots difficult to tamper with, as the drug cannot be easily
removed from stolen devices by simple dissolution in organic solvents. Moreover, having been
injected into the body the formulations could not be diverted from patients. The covalent
bonding prevents the drug from being active even after injection, and the drug is only released
by irradiation – not polymer degradation. However, since the bonds are photolabile, the patient
would be able to release the drug with a simple handheld or wearable light source. This
approach would allow patients to determine the timing, intensity, and duration of analgesia
throughout the postoperative period."

The proposed R61/R33 project would build on our published pilot data and animal models to demonstrate that
moderate intensity physical exercise delivered after exposure therapy engages fear circuitry and enhances the
consolidation of therapeutic safety learning, thereby enabling enhanced symptom reduction for PTSD. In the
R61 target engagement phase, adults with PTSD related to interpersonal violence (IPV) exposure would
complete an initial session of imaginal exposure to traumatic memory cues adapted for an MRI setting. This
would be followed by 30-mins of moderate intensity exercise or low intensity walking control. Participants
would return 24-hrs later to complete a second session of imaginal exposure with MRI. We hypothesize greater
between-session reductions in fear responding and fear circuit activation to traumatic memory cues 24-hrs
later among those who exercised following the first session compared to those in the walking control condition.
The R33 phase will build upon successful target engagement and adapt a brief version of prolonged exposure
(PE) therapy to include moderate-intensity exercise or walking control after imaginal exposure. We hypothesize
that PE with exercise will result in more rapid and larger reductions in PTSD symptoms and reduced fear-
related neurocircuitry activation and affective arousal to trauma cues compared to PE plus walking control.
Overall, this project is designed to demonstrate that a novel intervention (moderate intensity exercise) engages
key mechanisms of therapeutic exposure, thereby enhancing the efficacy of exposure therapy."
10785132,"ABSTRACT
Tobacco use continues to disproportionately harm priority populations, such as smokers with mental health
conditions and people from low socioeconomic status (SES) groups. The US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) is moving forward with a groundbreaking plan to reduce tobacco-related death and disease by lowering
nicotine in combusted cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. To maximize the effectiveness of this potentially
life-saving policy, its implementation needs to be accompanied by messages that address misperceptions
about very low nicotine cigarettes (VLNCs; e.g., that VLNCs are less harmful than regular cigarettes). Past
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with VLNCs found that they are less addictive than cigarettes, reduce the
number of cigarettes smoked per day, and have similar beneficial effects among priority populations as in the
general population. However, past RCTs with VLNCs did not include messages about the products or policy.
Emerging studies have begun to investigate messages about VLNCs, but so far they did not examine the
effects of messages on behavior and were all hypothetical, with messages unaccompanied by use of the
actual product. We propose to take the next step and bring together two streams of research (RCTs of VLNCs
and messages about VLNCs) that have remained disparate but need to be combined to more closely resemble
reduced nicotine policy implementation in the real world. We will address three specific aims: (1) Develop
targeted messages about reduced nicotine in combusted tobacco products for smokers with serious
psychological distress (SPD) and socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers using qualitative focus groups.
(2) Test the impact of messages about VLNCs on tobacco use behaviors in an RCT with smokers with SPD,
low-SES, and smokers who are neither. After 1-week baseline using normal nicotine content cigarettes,
participants will be randomized into treatment (VLNCs and messages) or control (VLNCs only) condition.
Participants in the treatment condition will be exposed to messages as inserts (small printed leaflets) in
cigarette packs and print and video ads during weekly in-person visits. All participants will use VLNCs for 4
weeks and complete daily logs and weekly in-person visits. (3) Assess experiences with VLNCs and messages
among the RCT participants in focus groups following the completion of the RCT. The results will contribute to
the science that informs FDA regulatory actions around product review, product standards, and public
education on nicotine."

 Lung diseases impacting the gas exchange alveoli, including COVID-19, are becoming the leading cause
of death. A multi-lineage, transcriptional, and epigenetic understanding of alveologenesis and re-
alveologenesis upon injury is a timely response to the disease burden and leverages latest single-cell
technology. My lab’s track record in studying the lung epithelial, endothelial, and mesenchymal lineages lays
the foundation for pursuing a poorly understood process of cellular maturation (Theme 1), a recently identified
capillary cell type (Theme 2), and a novel signaling regulation of distinct mesenchymal cell populations (Theme
3). The anticipated knowledge will tackle fundamental questions of cell fate, plasticity, and signaling; shed light
on bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension, acute lung injury, as well as non-coding variants
from genome-wide association studies; and opens the door to single-cell functional genomics applicable to any

CANDIDATE: I am currently an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care
at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine (WUSM). My career goal is to become an
independent, federally funded physician-scientist who utilizes rigorous implementation science and community-
based participatory research methods to improve the lives of patients with asthma, especially those from
disadvantaged backgrounds. To date I have received funding from the NIH Loan Repayment Program,
institutional T32 and KL2 awards, and the American Lung Association. While this past support has been
foundational, to reach my long-term goals, advanced training in implementation science and community-based
participatory research is required. In this proposal, I am mentored by world-renowned leaders in these areas.
Together, we have designed a research project and career development plan that, we believe, is impactful and
will provide me the training necessary to be competitive for R01-level, or equivalent, support before its
conclusion.
PROPOSED ENVIRONMENT: This proposal occurs within three complementary settings. First, this research
occurs at WUSM. To date, I have benefited immensely from WUSM’s career development resources and will
continue to leverage them to reach my career goals. The second setting for this proposal is the Brown School
at Washington University, which is one of the leading institutions for implementation science and community-
based participatory research. During a K23 award I will take two classes in advanced implementation science
methodology offered by its expert faculty. Finally, this study will be deployed within community health centers
in the St. Louis Integrated Health Network and complemented by didactic education and participation in
activities within the Center for Community Health Partnership and Research at WUSM.
RESEARCH ABSTRACT: The NHLBI’s asthma guideline body recommends single maintenance and reliever
therapy (SMART) for all patients with moderate/severe asthma. This recommendation is based on findings that
SMART decreases the risk of asthma exacerbations by one-third. However, within a network of federally
qualified health centers in St. Louis with whom we have partnered, <10% of asthma patients are prescribed
SMART. My team and I are developing and contextualizing a multi-level SMART implementation bundle, which
includes: clinician-level education with practice facilitation/supervision; an audit and feedback program; and
provision of patient-centered, electronic SMART education aides with updated asthma action plans. In this
proposed type 1 hybrid stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial, we aim to: 1) assess the effectiveness of the
SMART implementation bundle at increasing prescription of SMART (Aim 1, 1° effectiveness outcome), and
(2) utilize the RE-AIM framework to guide a quantitative and qualitative assessment of implementation
outcomes, including adoption (Aim 2, 1° implementation outcome)."
10798317,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Multimorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of two or more physical or mental chronic illnesses,
is prevalent and rising globally. New measures of multimorbidity that provide unique insights into the spectrum,
pattern and magnitude of multiple co-morbid conditions are needed. Current measures fail to provide adequate
context from which to design, evaluate, and implement multilevel clinically-relevant interventions.
Objective: In response to PAR-20-179, we propose to develop, visualize and apply a modular suite of novel
measures and tools to address the critical limitations currently impacting multimorbidity outcomes research.
Specific Aims: (1) Develop personalized cumulative burden measures, over various stages of the life-course,
based on patient perspectives using condition-weighted burden weights and risk factors; (2) Create a suite of
web-based visualizations for use by any type of cohort; (3) Apply the cumulative burden to an independent
cohort of sickle cell disease patients to test implementation and guide future dissemination to other cohorts.
Study design: Two novel measures, which built on our existing cumulative burden framework, will be
developed using data from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) study, a large clinical cohort of pediatric
cancer survivors. First, we will develop a personalized measure of multimorbidity risk for an individual using a
regression framework of the Poisson process to provide insights into lifelong variations in patterns and
magnitude of multiple chronic conditions and associated key risk factors. Second, we will implement burden
weights, a set of condition-specific weights derived from utility weights (which we will also calculate) using
SJLIFE data in order to incorporate patient perspectives. To use/share the metrics, the Agile approach to
software development will be employed to create dynamic, interactive web-based visualizations. Finally, using
the consolidated framework for implementation research, we will apply the cumulative burden method to study
multimorbidity in a second cohort comprised of adults and children with sickle cell disease in order to advance
national research priorities and study how others may our innovative measures to their cohorts.
Significance: Our cumulative burden measure was created to overcome some of the pressing difficulties with
current multimorbidity measures identified by PAR-20-179. This proposed study seeks to build on our prior
work by incorporating personalized risk prediction and patient-reported outcomes. Additionally, we recognize
that developing new measures and publishing our methods are insufficient to ensure broad use and impact. To
support effective implementation and dissemination, we will create visual tools that help investigators share
cumulative burden results and study the barriers and enablers of their application using an implementation
science approach. We anticipate our work will yield a suite of visualization templates and modular applied
method resources that will enable clinicians, researchers, advocacy groups, and policymakers an opportunity
to shed light on the growing problem of multimorbidity affecting nearly every sub-group of our society."
10805714,"The nation, including the state of Arizona with a population that is 38.5% Latino and Native American, suffers
from tremendous health disparities contributed to, in part, by the absence of a diverse biomedical research and
healthcare workforce. Never has there been a greater need for health equity that needs to be addressed by a
diverse research workforce and infrastructure than during and following the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)
pandemic during which time our minority communities were disproportionately affected by the pandemic due to
respiratory failure and pulmonary-sleep manifestations of post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC). In this
renewal application, we propose to build upon our past successes with innovative approaches and best
practices to advance research education tailored for qualified PRIDE trainees. The overarching goal of our
program is to provide advanced research training experiences and long-term mentoring in an interprofessional
environment to qualified candidates -- junior faculty and transitioning postdoctoral scientists from diverse
backgrounds, including those from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical sciences -- who are
committed to investigating the factors responsible for differences in health among populations as they pertain
to lung, sleep-related breathing disorders, and the consequences of the pandemic to these systems. Our
proposal is to redesign, organize, and implement a NHLBI mission-focused Summer Institute program that will
support AiRE and program faculty to nationally recruit eligible and highly-qualified individuals in order to
provide advanced training experiences and long-term mentoring that will enable them to develop a research
program and work with their home institution to obtain NIH funding and develop their career and gain
leadership skills. The research training experiences will be tailored to the trainee and designed to enhance
their research skills, experiences, and knowledge base in lung and sleep-related breathing disorders research
with attention to the specific scientific area of infectious and immunobiological consequences of the pandemic
on lung and sleep using cross-cutting methodological approaches. The broader goal of the AiRE training
program is to create a rigorous interprofessional research training program that attracts highly-qualified early
career faculty and transitioning post-doctoral scientists, offering them the academic and collaborative research
experience that supports a successful and productive career in the study of disparities in lung, sleep-related
breathing disorders, and their pandemic-related consequences. The impact would be to engender a diverse
biomedical research workforce in lung, sleep, and their pandemic-related consequences that can help us better
understand health disparities and promote health equity."

Candidate. Dr. Sasha Fahme is an Internal Medicine-trained physician-scientist who has spent the past four
years conducting refugee health research in Lebanon. She has first-hand experience treating sexually
transmitted infections (STIs) and conducting sexual and reproductive health (SRH) studies of Syrian refugee
women. She has trained a Lebanese research team and Syrian peer educators to conduct SRH research and
has established capacity for STI testing. Her preliminary data suggest that Syrian refugee women are eager to
learn about SRH from peers and to engage in longitudinal SRH care, with 89% 1-year retention. She seeks to
adapt and pilot-test an evidence-based intervention (EBI) to address barriers to SRH care in this population.
Career Goals. Dr. Fahme's goals are:
1. To gain expertise in mixed-methods health sciences research.
2. To strengthen experience in the conduct of humanitarian health research.
3. To foster implementation science skills to develop and evaluate evidence-based interventions.
4. To develop skills in dissemination to translate research findings into practice.
5. To build leadership skills and successfully compete for R01 research grants.
Career Development. Dr. Fahme will achieve her goals through workshops, virtual courses, and one-on-one
mentored training from Dr. Fitzgerald (career mentorship, humanitarian health, STI epidemiology) Dr. DeJong
(mixed-methods, humanitarian health), Dr. Downs (implementation science), and Dr. Abu-Raddad (STI
epidemiology, dissemination). She will disseminate contextualized STI guidelines based on her findings, and
present her research at international conferences. She will participate in grant-writing workshops and submit
an R01 proposal of a hybrid type I cluster-randomized trial to improve Syrian refugee women's SRH in Year 5.
Environment. The proposed research and training will take place at Weill Cornell Medical College (New York,
USA) and at the American University of Beirut (Beirut, Lebanon), a global leader in refugee health research.
Research. Syrian refugee women in Lebanon are among the world's largest and most vulnerable displaced
populations, with a high burden of genital infection symptoms. The etiologies of these symptoms are not known
and access to treatment is limited by numerous barriers that are most acute among rural women. Dr. Fahme
will recruit 204 symptomatic, rural Syrian refugee women to participate in a longitudinal mixed-methods study.
She hypothesizes that >30% will experience recurrent genital infections, and that guidelines fail to address
drivers of recurrence, which she will explore through in-depth interviews. She will use these data, the ADAPT-
ITT model, and the Implementation Outcomes Framework to adapt and evaluate an EBI to address genital
infection symptoms in a single-group pilot feasibility study among 30 Syrian refugee women."

There is growing interest in the use of electrical stimulation to promote the recovery of sensorimotor and
autonomic function after neural injury. Previous research from our lab and others has demonstrated that
stimulation of spinal lumbar segments activates central pattern generators, which, in turn, facilitates standing
and walking. However, while there is extensive animal, pre-clinical, and clinical data examining the impact of
lumbar stimulation, studies that apply neuromodulation to the cervical spinal cord for upper limb are very limited.
Here, we propose that fundamental blind spots exist in the field of neuromodulation for upper limb, including
where to stimulate anatomically, how to dose and, especially, mechanisms of action. The Horner lab has
developed a clinically relevant rat model of cervical spinal cord injury and engineered a self-contained epidural
stimulation device that can be deployed in freely behaving rats to stimulate sensorimotor circuitry from multiple
surfaces of the spinal cord. Hence, we are well positioned to test critically important hypotheses on the role of
cervical stimulation in the restoration of upper limb function. We present exciting preliminary data demonstrating
that epidural stimulation of the cervical spinal cord improves forelimb function. The rationale for the proposed
research is that the site of epidural stimulation provides unique access to motor circuitry. We hypothesize that
ventral positioning of electrodes (VSS) will provide access to stimulate motor circuitry at the site of
lesion that are inaccessible from the more common dorsal approach (DSS). Further, we propose that
VSS will produce novel mechanisms of function plasticity that can amplify recovery when combined with
DSS. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Determine acute molecular and physiological
mechanisms of VSS when applied to subacute cervical spinal cord injury. Aim 2: Establish the functional impact
of site of stimulation and rehabilitative training on recovery from early chronic cervical spinal cord injury. Aim 3:
Establish the synergistic effects of combined VSS and DSS after cervical spinal cord injury. These studies will
explore an exciting new approach to promote neural recovery of the upper limb, an area of research that has
had limited investigation, but remains a primary concern for the patient. Our approach will rigorously establish
the physiological and functional effects of the site of stimulation on the molecular and physiological mechanisms
of upper limb plasticity."

Decision making is a core component of normal and abnormal cognitive function. Understanding the
neural mechanisms of decision-making will lead to advances in the diagnosis, classification and future
treatments of disorders affecting thought and control. Mathematical models of the decision process,
based on bounded evidence accumulation, have been developed over decades and are being
increasingly leveraged to gain deeper insights into the origins of cognitive deficits arising from a range
of brain disorders. However, major gaps remain in our understanding of the neural mechanisms
responsible for decision-making, thereby limiting the validity and utility of the models. A successful line
of research on perceptual decision-making has established that neurons in the parietal and prefrontal
cortex of the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) encode the accumulating evidence bearing on the
alternatives. These observations are mainly from neurons in areas of the macaque cortex that are
associated with preparation of the actions (e.g. hand or eye movements) for reporting the decision
alternatives. However, decisions are often formed without knowledge of what actions they might call
for, and under such conditions, effector-selective neural activity does not appear to reflect accumulation
dynamics. Recent studies, have identified a novel ‘abstract’ decision signal in non-invasive
electrophysiological (EEG) recordings from human decision makers. The signal, termed the central
parietal positivity (CPP), represents the accumulation of evidence for decisions irrespective of the
sensory or motor requirements of the task, hence the designation, abstract. The neural circuits that
give rise to the CPP are likely to explain the capacity to flexibly link decisions to various actions
depending on context and goals. However, because the signal has thus far only been observed in EEG
recordings from humans, its neural basis is unknown. The proposed aims will (1) establish the neural
underpinnings of the CPP by establishing its analogues in single-neuron, multi-neuron, local field
potentials and EEG of the macaque and (2) localizing its source in humans through the use of
neuroimaging, and electrocorticography (ECoG) from patients undergoing neurosurgery. Both aims
draw on an integrated computational effort that combines biophysical modeling, neural networks, and
mathematical characterization of the decision process. The knowledge gained through these
investigations will increase our understanding of core cognitive capacities whose deficiency contributes
to major brain disorders while bridging long-standing methodological gaps in human versus non-human
animal investigations."
10807049,"Project Summary: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Related Disorders (ADRD), including frontotemporal dementia
(FTD), Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
cause significant morbidity and mortality in aging populations. Despite decades of research, there are still no
effective treatments to prevent or delay progression of these illnesses. Currently, there are tests available to
identify individuals at risk of developing AD, but these tests require either a cerebral spinal fluid assay or positron
emission tomography (PET) to measure amyloid levels, which are invasive or cost prohibitive, respectively,
limiting their usefulness. While blood based diagnostic tests using amyloid and tau biomarkers are being
developed to diagnose AD pathology in symptomatic individuals, their predictive value for preclinical disease is
still unknown. Furthermore, there are currently no blood-based tests available for ADRDs. Since AD and ADRD
develop over a prolonged period that can span decades, there is a need to identify individuals during this
preclinical period when potential interventions may be more effective. To address our inability to diagnose at-
risk individuals, we have put together a multidisciplinary team of investigators at Brown University and Rhode
Island Hospital with the long-term goal to discover easily accessible biomarkers that can be used in a clinical
setting to identify individuals at increased risk of developing AD or ADRD dementias prior to the onset of
proteinopathies. Our group recently published that AD-related mRNA transcripts can be detected in extracellular
vesicles (EVs) isolated from saliva in patients with traumatic brain injury. Our preliminary data show that patients
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD have 43 mRNA transcripts and 5 miRNAs that show altered
representation in salivary EVs. In addition, cognitively normal individuals with a PET scan that is positive for
amyloid β42 have mRNA and miRNA profiles that are similar to the MCI and mild AD patients. Based on this
data we hypothesize that the mRNA, miRNA, and protein composition of salivary EVs will provide valid
biomarkers for early diagnosis and following disease progression in patients with AD and related
neurodegenerative disorders. To test this hypothesis, we will use transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to
define a set of RNA and protein biomarkers present in salivary EVs that predict an individual's risk of developing
AD in Specific Aim 1. Specific Aim 2 will extend these investigations to identify RNA and protein biomarkers
in salivary EVs isolated from individuals with FTD, PD, DLB, and ALS. In Specific Aim 3 we will determine the
dynamics of changes in salivary EV composition during preclinical-to-AD clinical progression by following a
cohort of cognitively normal individuals with positive amyloid β42 blood test over a period of 3-5 years. The data
obtained in this project will allow us to identify biomarkers present in salivary EVs that can be used as a simple,
noninvasive screening mechanism to detect patients at risk of developing AD during the preclinical phase when
treatments may be more effective."
10810780,"Summary
 G protein-coupled receptors (GOCRs) regulate a variety of cell functions and are important targets of
therapeutics. A fundamental but poorly understood question in studying GPCRs is how targeted GPCR
trafficking is achieved. The overall goal of our research program is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
of nascent GPCR targeting to their functional destinations and to understand the role of targeting in
modulating cellular responses to hormones and drugs. Under this broad objective, this proposal will use α2-
adrenergic receptors (α2-ARs) as models to address the following two questions which are central to
understanding GPCR anterograde trafficking: 1) how newly synthesized GPCRs export from the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then transport en route from the ER through the Golgi to the cell surface;
and 2) how GPCRs are sorted from one another and from non-GPCR plasma membrane proteins during
their traffic along the biosynthetic pathway. The premise of this project is our recent findings that the ER-
Golgi-cell surface transport and sorting of α2A-AR and α2B-AR, two closely related, prototypic GPCRs, are
coordinated by ufmylation, an ubiquitination-like post-translational modification, and three interacting
proteins, C1orf27 (an ER membrane protein), coiled-coil α-helical rod protein 1 (HCR1) and Golgi-localized γ
ear-containing ARF-binding protein 3 (GGA3). We will define the novel functions of protein ufmylation and
C1orf27 in the ER-Golgi transport and sorting, as well as HCR1 and GGA3 in the post-Golgi traffic and
sorting of α2A-AR and α2B-AR, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The proposed research is a
continuation of our long-standing efforts to study the anterograde trafficking of GPCRs, which have led to
the discovery of a number of structural determinants and regulatory proteins essential for GPCR export and
sorting. As in the past, we will employ state-of-the-art biochemical, immunochemical and live cell imaging
techniques to dissect the mechanistic aspects of GPCR trafficking along the biosynthetic pathway, including
maturation, sorting and targeting. These studies will provide important insights into regulation of GPCR
export trafficking which is a poorly explored area in the study of the GPCR superfamily."
10810868,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a condition without a cure, characterized by the loss of somatosensory perception
and voluntary movement eventually resulting in muscle atrophy. Most research has focused on nerve
regeneration not muscle recovery, although nerve regeneration is useless if muscle deterioration is beyond
repair. Exercise soon after the injury is a common therapy to reduce muscle atrophy in animal models, but in
humans it is not possible in the acute phase after trauma. An effective therapy must reduce muscle
degeneration and improve muscle contractile properties in the acute phase after SCI until exercise is possible.
Our laboratory is pioneering the use of tamoxifen (TAM), an FDA-approved cancer drug, to reduce muscle
degeneration after trauma. TAM, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, could reverse the changes in muscle
type composition and reduce the SCI-induced effect on muscle fiber contractile properties because estradiol,
working through estrogen receptors (ER), has these effects. In addition, TAM has the potential benefit that it
could stimulate Satellite cell activation/proliferation. The interaction of TAM with different ERs suggests that
there is a possible sex difference in the response to this drug. Since sexual differences have been observed in
muscle fibers and contractile properties, new studies are necessary to define the effect of TAM in female and
male muscle tissue after SCI. Our preliminary data demonstrate that TAM improves locomotor recovery and
prevents myosin loss in muscle tissue. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that TAM, administered early
after SCI, will partially preserve the contractile properties of muscle fibers, reducing degeneration, and
ultimately increase myofiber proliferation/regeneration. In addition, we want to explore a possible sex
difference in the response to this drug and the metabolic profile activated or de-activated in muscle cells after
SCI. The present project has the following aims: AIM 1. To determine the effect of TAM to prevent a reduction
in the contractile properties of skeletal muscle fibers after SCI in male and female rats, and establish the
mechanisms by which this drug prevents muscle degeneration. We will implant TAM pellets in male and
female rats after a moderate contusion SCI. Contractile properties of Soleus and Tibialis anterior muscle fibers
will be evaluated and the expression profile of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms will be studied at 7, 14, and
28 days post-injury (DPI). AIM 2. To evaluate the effect of TAM on myogenic factors and
proliferative/regenerative proteins from skeletal muscle after SCI and establish if the effects in these cellular
events are sex-specific. Male and female rats will be treated with TAM after SCI. The effect of this drug on
Soleus and Tibialis expression of myogenic factors (Pax7, MyoD and myogenin), used as markers of Satellite
cell activation or proliferation and proteins associated to new muscle fiber formation (desmin and embryonic
MHC) will be tested at 7, 14, and 28 DPI. These experiments and their results may lead to novel therapeutic
strategies that enhance muscle and locomotor recovery after SCI."
10795127,"Epilepsy is a common pediatric neurological condition affecting ~470,000 youth in the United States. Adolescents with epilepsy are at significant risk for neurobehavioral comorbidities (i.e., depressive/behavioral symptoms) and suboptimal social, academic, and quality of life outcomes. Research suggests that deficits in executive functioning (EF), defined as the skills necessary for goal-directed and complex activities, including problem-solving, initiation, monitoring, organization, planning, self-regulation and working memory, contribute to suboptimal functioning. EF deficits have been documented in up to 50% of youth with epilepsy, which is 3 times the prevalence in healthy youth. Evidence-based interventions to improve EF could play a critical role in preventing adverse outcomes and promoting optimal functioning in adolescents with epilepsy; however none exists for this vulnerable population. To fill this gap, we successfully developed and tested Epilepsy Journey (EJ), a comprehensive e-health behavioral multi-component problem-solving intervention that combines 10 self-guided learning modules with 10 telehealth sessions. The promising proof-of-concept trial (n=39) showed high feasibility, acceptability, patient satisfaction, and significant improvements in parent-reported EF behaviors, neurobehavioral functioning, and quality of life. The next logical phase of this research is to conduct a definitive randomized clinical trial to examine: 1) whether the two components of treatment (EJ modules and telehealth) are both essential, 2) if the intervention generalizes to a racially diverse sample, and 3) has a durable impact on improving parent-reported and performance-based EF behaviors. Thus, the aim of the current proposal is to conduct a multi-site Phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) using a 2x2 factorial design to examine the efficacy of separate (EJ modules and EJ telehealth) and combined components of EJ on EF. Participants positive for EF deficits (n=232) will be randomized to one of four arms: 1) EJ modules with telehealth sessions, 2) EJ modules alone, 3) EJ telehealth sessions alone, or 4) Usual Care (no EJ modules or telehealth sessions). Treatment participants will either independently review EJ modules focused on EF skills (~15-30 min.) and/or have weekly telehealth sessions (~30-45 min.) with a therapist for three months. The groups will learn and apply problem-solving strategies to their individual EF difficulties. Participants will complete measures at baseline, post-treatment, 3- and 12-months post-treatment to examine maintenance of effects. There is a critical need for evidence-based interventions to improve executive functioning behaviors in youth with epilepsy. If the aims of this UG3/UH3 are achieved, we will have definitive evidence for addressing EF deficits. We expect that EJ modules and EJ telehealth will demonstrate efficacy alone and in combination, which will allow patients to select the approach best suited to their specific situation. Consequently, we can improve long-term outcomes (e.g., neurobehavioral comorbidities, academic success, social relationships, and QOL) in adolescents with epilepsy, a high-risk population."

The goals of the Florida RCC are to: a) provide a robust and efficient infrastructure to implement high-quality research clinical trials that address acute stroke treatment, prevention, and recovery; b) leverage the internal and regional resources to enhance the Stroke Trials Network; c) train the next generation of stroke clinical and translational researchers and enhance the careers of research personnel. The Florida RCC encompasses a large network of participating acute stroke, rehabilitation and pediatric hospitals that span across Florida, and is designed to ensure robust enrollment of an ethnically diverse population that reflects the changing demographics of the US. Our RCC has a successful track record of enrollment in numerous NINDS acute and secondary prevention stroke trials and is involved in other NIH networks and coordinates multicenter studies. Through our participating sites, extended referral network, and multidisciplinary expertise, we will build upon the close partnership with pre-hospital Emergency Services, Emergency Medicine, Vascular Neurosurgery, Interventional Neurology, Neuro-Critical Care, Pediatric Neurology and Neurorehabilitation, as well as on academic-public-private institutional collaborations, to enroll and manage potential study participants. We also have unique resources that we can bring to the network. Integrated collaboration among cutting-edge researchers in the areas of preclinical stroke, stem cells, human genomics, biorepository, brain bank, and the Miami CTSI make us uniquely positioned to develop, propose and implement novel translational early-phase projects. The large residency and fellowship training programs in Neurosciences, the multidisciplinary educational resources in the institution, and our track record of mentoring clinical researchers, position our center to effectively train stroke researchers in clinical and translational research through a structured mentored program. In this cycle, we will also implement a robust career enhancement program for research personnel to maintain and expand research expertise. Over the past funding cycle, we have been an outstanding Stroke Net member: we were the highest enrolling RCC in the network, we expanded the RCC representation across Florida by adding new outstanding sites, trained 4 Stroke Net scholars, participated in 3 working groups and committees, submitted new proposals to the Network, and were engaged in all aspects of the program. Therefore, we have the depth and breadth of expertise and resources to successfully function as a RCC in the Stroke Net."

 Dengue virus (DENV) and other flaviviruses are major human pathogens that cause significant disease.
Transmitted by widespread mosquito species, many of these viruses spread rapidly and can have a
devastating impact on public health where prior immunity does not exist. There is thus a significant need for
countermeasures to combat both current and future flavivirus threats. Major limitations in current antivirals
development are the relatively small number of validated antiviral targets, most of which are viral enzymes
(e.g., polymerases, proteases); the low barrier to resistance when direct-acting antivirals are used as
monotherapies; and the narrow spectrum activity of most of these agents (“one bug, one drug”). New classes
of targets that can mediate broad-spectrum activity against related viruses and that have high barriers to
resistance are particularly needed to combat emerging viruses since we generally lack sufficient time and
resources to develop new drugs on a useful time scale once these viruses pose significant threats.
 Small molecules targeting the flavivirus envelope protein, E, have the potential to mimic the humoral
immune response by engaging their target extracellularly and blocking viral entry early in the replication cycle.
We have identified multiple small molecule inhibitor series that bind to the DENV envelope protein, E, and
inhibit E-mediated membrane fusion during viral entry even when only a minority of copies of E on the particle
are inhibitor-bound. These compounds bind in a pocket between domains I and II and inhibit West Nile, Zika,
and Japanese encephalitis viruses due to at least partial conservation of this site. We recently established a
target-based assay and validated its use in the identification of new inhibitors of DENV and Zika E proteins
that bind in the conserved pocket and that have more drug-like properties than our original inhibitors. Building
on this work, we now propose a comprehensive plan to rationally optimize small molecule inhibitors of the
DENV E protein as a potential anti-viral strategy. Towards this end, we will combine modeling and structure-
guided drug design with an efficient screening cascade using complementary target-based biochemical,
cellular and mechanistic assays to enable efficient optimization of two chemically distinct lead series. Our
primary goal in this work is to demonstrate antiviral efficacy in a murine model of DENV infection, thus laying
the foundation for first-in-class direct acting antivirals to treat the growing global threat that DENV poses."

Alveolar bone is a critical tissue for tooth and dental implant retention. Increasing alveolar bone mass in
patients who lose this tissue as a result of periodontal disease or trauma is crucial for successful dental implant
therapy (e.g., loss of bone around a tooth extraction site prior to implant placement). Currently, bone grafts
(e.g., iliac or mandibular bone) or artificial bone grafts are commonly used for alveolar bone regeneration
therapy. However, most of these therapies require extensive surgical procedures, which present risks of many
complications, particularly in aged patients. Therefore, the development of new alveolar bone regeneration
techniques that do not require surgical procedures is urgently needed. Herein, in this proposed study, we aim
to develop an injectable and biomimetic highly porous nanofiber microsphere-based therapy for healing critical-
sized alveolar bone defects. We recently developed an exciting approach for the fabrication of biomimetic
nanofiber microspheres consisting of short electrospun nanofiber segments without limitation to certain
compositions. Cells can attach and proliferate on the surface of such nanofiber microspheres. Working with Dr.
Reinhardt (Co-I), we also demonstrated that mineralized short nanofibers incorporated with E7-BMP-2
peptides showed promise for healing a critical-sized socket defect model created in rat maxillae, following
extraction of the first molar teeth. In addition, our most recent study revealed that BMP-2/QK peptides
conjugated nanofiber microspheres can significantly enhance osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and tubular network formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs). Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that the injectable highly porous nanofiber
microspheres in combination with biomimetic delivery of signaling molecules and/or incorporation of BMSCs
could greatly promote alveolar bone regeneration after minimally invasive administration to critical-sized
alveolar bone defects in rats. To test the hypothesis and accomplish the primary objective, our strategy is
three-fold: i) Demonstrate the fabrication of porous nanofiber microspheres with controlled composition,
structure, and coupling of signaling molecules; ii) Examine the effect of engineered porous nanofiber
microspheres with biomimetic delivery of signaling molecules on cellular response; and iii) Determine the bone
regenerative capacity of injectable porous nanofiber microspheres in combination with biomimetic delivery of
signaling molecules and/or BMSCs for healing alveolar bone defects in rats. We expect to identify the critical
factors of biomimetic and injectable highly porous nanofiber microsphere-based therapy that contribute to
alveolar bone regeneration. Also, we expect successful completion of these aims to lay the foundation for
developing injectable bone grafts that could greatly accelerate healing of alveolar bone defects without
invasive surgical procedures."
10798233,"Project Summary
 The proposed research examines to what extent the observed quality of childhood and adolescent
experiences with maternal and paternal caregivers shape young adults’ basic expectations about the degree to
which significant others are likely to be available, responsive, and helpful under challenging circumstances
and, in turn, to what extent those expectancies among adults predict both: (a) mental and physical health and
(b) interpersonal adjustment in adulthood, as reflected in the quality of adults’ romantic relationships as well as
their infants’ attachments in the next generation. There is increasing evidence that these expectations—which
are reflected in variation in secure base script knowledge—represent fundamental psychological resources that
support healthy adult interpersonal relationships along with mental and physical health in the years of maturity.
(Secure base script knowledge is reflected in an individual’s ability to generate autobiographical narratives in
which attachment-relevant events are encountered, a clear need for assistance is communicated, competent
help is provided, and the problem is resolved). Our proposal seeks to provide more definitive, large sample
evidence regarding the origins of secure base script knowledge in interpersonal experiences with primary
caregivers from infancy through late adolescence, along with precise estimates of the transmission of such
expectancies from parents to their children across risk status, participant sex, and two racial groups
(White/non-Hispanic and Black), Aims fundamental to the goals of NIH and the EKS NICHD in particular.
 Recent re-analyses of the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation (MLSRA; Sroufe et al.,
2009) a moderately-sized sample born into poverty, have demonstrated that Adult Attachment Interviews
(AAIs; George et al., 1985), coded for secure base script knowledge are more strongly associated with the
quality of antecedent caregiving and more predictive of attachment security in the next generation (Waters et
al., 2018) than current, widespread scoring methods for the AAI. We intend to take advantage of the 2 largest
available databases on the antecedents and intergenerational transmission of attachment, as assessed by the
AAI, to replicate and significantly extend analyses based on the MLSRA and, in so doing, potentially move best
practices regarding the assessment of adult attachment representations in the field forward significantly. More
specifically, the proposed grant will support curation and secondary coding for secure base script knowledge of
the two largest AAI corpora in the world pertinent to the caregiving antecedents, adult consequences, and
intergenerational transmission of secure base script knowledge: (1) the age 18 year AAI transcripts from the
NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N=857) and (2) a large sub-sample of available AAI
transcripts (N=~1900) drawn from both higher and normative-risk samples contained within the Collaboration
on Attachment Transmission Synthesis commons (CATS), a data resource prepared for individual participant
data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies of the intergenerational transmission of attachment security.

10799433,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DLBCL
tumors are highly heterogeneous and molecular profiling has revealed 100s of mutations that can be clustered
into five distinct prognostically relevant sub-groups, however biomarkers that include TME elements have not
been developed. In our parent R01, we hypothesized that successful development of next generation
immune targeting therapies for lymphoma will require spatially resolved, highly multiplexed single cell
based biomarkers of TME composition and structure. For that project we proposed to perform imaging
mass cytometry analysis (IMC) on over 2000 cases of aggressive B cell lymphoma with the following aims:
Specific Aim 1: Validate spatially-derived protein biomarkers of DLBCL outcomes (n=830 patients). Specific
Aim 2: Analyze the single cell topology of histologically diverse aggressive B cell lymphomas (n=1380) to
identify shared TME based biomarkers across all aggressive B cell lymphoma. Specific Aim 3: Determine
which TME elements modulate chemoresistance and mediate response to immune therapies in lymphoma
through in vitro and in vitro model systems. A significant limitation of Aim 3 was that it relied on a single
syngeneic model system, A20, that does not represent that genetic diversity or complexity seen in DLBCL.
This was due to a major gap in the field as model systems that represent the five genetic sub-groups have not
been developed. In this revision, we propose a new Aim, Revision Aim 4, where we will apply the IMAT
supported technology Mosaic Analysis by Dual Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (MADR) to rapidly
develop complex genetic models of DLBCL that recapitulate the genetic diversity seen in human disease. This
will allow us to perform functional validation of the spatial biomarkers we identify in Aims 1 and 2 of the parent
grant in the context of each specific mutational subtype. This will significantly enhance the impact of the
original grant and be the first application of MADR technology in a hematologic cancer. Once established these
MADR derived mouse models will enable testing of targeted therapies in each genetic sub-group, which is
currently not possible with the currently available pre-clinical models."

Cardiovascular disease and its risk factors are major contributors to health burden and early death. Physical
activity and sleep patterns are important behaviors that are causally tied to cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality. Additionally, an individual’s genetic predisposition contributes to either increased or decreased risk of
these conditions. The extent to which modifiable activity and sleep behaviors combine with genetic background
to influence cardiovascular risk is not known. This is an important knowledge gap because contemporary
physical activity recommendations do not account for genetic variability. The All of Us Research Program
offers a unique combination of long-term activity and sleep data from wearable devices, whole-genome
sequencing, and clinical outcomes from patients seeking care. These data sources provide an opportunity to
understand how behaviors interact with genetic factors to contribute to incident disease risk. We hypothesize
that increased physical activity and improved sleep will be necessary to mitigate excess genetic risk. Physical
activity and sleep duration and quality can be quantified and tracked by wearables that are now widely used by
the public. These devices enable high quality, longitudinal collection of these measures to integrate to inform
impact on disease. Genetic risk is a significant contributor to cardiovascular disease and an important factor to
consider when quantifying the role of modifiable behaviors. Genetic background represents a risk floor upon
which behavior and environment interact to determine disease onset and severity. It is currently unclear to
what degree behaviors such as physical activity and sleep might need to be adjusted to the specific genetic
background of the individual. In preliminary work using All of Us data, we performed a phenome-wide
association study of the association between step counts and incident chronic disease. Over 5.9 million
person-days of monitoring, cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and major depression)
emerged among 1,700 phenotypes as most strongly associated with lower step counts. We now propose to
extend our work to measure the impact of underlying genetic risk and activity and sleep patterns on
cardiovascular risk. Aim 1 will quantify the interaction of genetic risk and physical activity on modifying incident
cardiovascular risk factors using polygenic risk scores for obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and
depression. Secondary analyses will examine the impact of genetic risk on cardiovascular outcomes. Aim 2 will
assess the impact of sleep duration on incident cardiovascular risk factors with and without integration of
genetic risk. Our investigative team is uniquely qualified to maximally leverage the available sources of data in
All of Us to quantify the combined impact of sleep, activity, and genetics on cardiovascular risk. We have
collective expertise in cardiovascular disease, genomic analysis, electronic health record cohorts, sleep
research, and use of Fitbit data. The results of this work will provide an initial step toward personalization of
activity and sleep guidance that incorporates genetic background."

 The former Aging and Transgenic Animal Core now Proteostasis and Aging Animal Models Core (Core C)
and referred in the PP text as “Animal Core” will continue to support the need for in vivo experimental mouse
models of the four projects of this Program Project (PP).
 The long-term goals of this Core are to provide the projects with a wide repertoire of age-controlled animal
models with modified autophagic function and mouse models designed for the in vivo assessment of
autophagy activity. These animals have been and will keep being essential for performing studies contained
in all four projects that will characterize the consequences of the age-related changes in autophagy on
different aspects of cell biology and organ and system function. Furthermore, the core will also supply different
mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease used by all projects, which will provide models of central proteotoxicity
to characterize how altered proteostasis in the brain may affect proteostatic equilibrium in peripheral tissues
and vice versa.
 The specific aims of the core are: 1) to generate and maintain i. genetically modified animals with altered
autophagy in different tissues; ii. mice expressing autophagy reporters; and iii. genetic models of proteotoxicity
in Alzheimer’s disease; 2) to maintain age-controlled colonies of wild-type and genetically modified mice; 3)
to serve as a link among the investigators in the Program Project by coordinating the sacrifice of animals to
maximize their use and by integrating the information obtained from the different animal models by each
investigator; 4) to facilitate uniformity in the mouse interventions incorporated in all the projects during this
new period; 5) to collect longitudinal information on some of the transgenic mouse models shared by all
projects and integrate the heath-span information from each project in the same animals.
 Services: The core will continue offering assistance with maintenance of the mouse colonies, coordination
of genotyping, administration and monitoring of animal treatments (diets and pharmacological compounds),
animal dissection, collection of tissue samples for storage or histopathological analysis and continuous access
to a searchable animal data base.
 Key personnel: the director, who is assisted by the animal technicians. The director supervises all the
activities of the Core, approves animal use by the PP members, establishes breeding schemes to
accommodate the project needs and oversees animal information input in the database. The technicians
perform all of the activities related to the maintenance of the animal colonies, genotyping, treatments, tissue
collection, behavioral testing and inputs information into the database.
Relevance: The services provided by this core are central to all the activities of the projects included in this
PP to understand the role of proteostasis in aging and disease and to develop genetic and chemical
interventions to modulate the aging process as a way to prevent or delay Alzheimer’s disease onset. The
centralization and sharing of animals optimizes cost efficiency and guarantees integration of information
coming from different systems and organs in all animal models used in this study."

project leaders to accomplish the innovation component.
 The long-term goal of this core is to provide support for the needs of the individual projects on synthesizing
currently available novel autophagy modulators, validating compounds from screening and hit-to-lead medicinal
chemistry optimization targeting different autophagy pathways and assessing the impact of these compounds
by modulating autophagy in Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias.
 The specific aims of this core are: 1) to provide a chemical biology facility that will assist the investigators of
the program projects and cores to have access to novel modulators of autophagy and information for their proper
formulation and use in cellular and in vivo mouse studies. 2) to facilitate chemical screening approaches, hit
selection, hit validation, and target identification and engagement using chemical biology approaches 3) to work
with project leaders for the validation and expansion of hit compounds and hit-to-lead optimization using
principles of medicinal chemistry.
 Components: 1) The chemical biology unit will provide chemical synthesis of compounds and chemical
probes, compound distribution, analytical characterization of compounds and assistance with the solubilization,
formulation and assay of compounds 2) The innovation unit will validate, optimize and implement different
chemical modulators of autophagy using medicinal chemistry towards proof-of-concept in vivo studies for
Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias.
 Services: the core will assist with the design, chemical synthesis, purification and analytical characterization
of novel autophagy modulators, the design and synthesis of chemical probes for target identification and
engagement studies in vivo, validation of hits and hit expansion studies by computational drug design
approaches, design and synthesis of focused chemical libraries for structure-activity relationships studies,
medicinal chemistry for hit-to-lead optimization, advice and assistance with solubilization, proper use in assays,

 Loss of proteostasis is considered one of the process that contributes to aging. Among the different
components of the proteostasis network, this program project (PP) focuses on Autophagy. During previous
periods we have identified new types of selective autophagy, their interplay among them and with other
components of the proteostasis network, new functions of autophagy beyond proteostasis maintenance,
mechanisms responsible for autophagic pathways’ malfunctioning in aging and the impact of this
malfunctioning in organ proteostasis and function. The knowledge, technology and experimental tools
developed by this PP allow now this project to answer two to fundamental questions in the context of
Geroscience: 1) is there a bi-directional interplay between autophagy in peripheral organs and central nervous
system and does this interconnection explains the non-phsicological comorbilities that associate with
Alzhiemer’s disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD)? and 2) can prevention of aging of the autophagic
system attenuate proteotoxicity associated with AD/ADRD, one of the most prevalent diseases of aging?.
 With this purpose and in close collaboration with the other components of this PP we will: 1) determine
if models of AD-related brain proteotoxicity have disturbances in peripheral proteostasis and if that is true in
peripheral patient cells; 2) analyze the effect of aging of the autophagy system in peripheral organs on the
aged brain and in onset of AD-related proteotoxicity 3) investigate the effect of chemical or genetic
enhancement of central and/or peripheral autophagy on brain aging and AD-proteotoxicity.
Integration in the PP: this project will utilize experimental mouse models with AD-relate proteins to
recapitulate the proteotoxicity of the AD brain, and the aging mouse groups generated by the Animal Core and
shared by all the projects. Image-based analysis of the changes in peripheral and central autophagy will be
done with the state-of-the-art image technology provided by the Image Core and treatment of the animal
models with autophagy enhancers will be done with the Therapeutics Core. Mechanisms of
intercommunication between peripheral and central autophagy will be investigated with P2, and the cross-talk
between autophagic pathways with P4. Information on peripheral and central autophagy generated in these
collaborative and on autophagic pathways in in the immune and hematopoietic system generated by P3 in the
same models will be integrated at the Biostatistics Unit.
Relevance to public health: Studies in this project may provide novel information on the bases of other
comorbidities that affect AD/ADRD patients and on how they may contribute also to disease progression. If
successful, the interventions proposed in this work may offer a proof-of-concept and prototype molecules for
future development of drugs for treatment of neurodegenerative conditions that originate from proteotoxic
insults by preventing aging of the autophagy system."

10932176,"Project Summary/Abstract
In today’s globalized world, food safety capacities need to be strengthened everywhere to enable more
rational and effective controls in all countries. The main objective of this project is to contribute to the
strengthening of national food control systems through provision of authoritative and practical
guidance, training materials and capacity development activities at global level and in a number of
selected countries.
The proposed approach is based on two complementary pillars, each comprised of activities at global,
and regional/country levels.
Pillar 1 deals with the promotion an support to the sound use of FAO/WHO food control system, which
allows a systematic and reliable evaluation of how national systems are performing and where the
critical weaknesses lie. At country level, the assessment process entails the development of national
action plans for improving the system and verify the achievement of target improvements and thus
promote accountability among decision makers vis-a-vis potential contributing donors or technical
agencies. Successful implementation contributes to reduce food safety risks for domestic consumers in
the beneficiary countries and to promote economic development through increased food and
agricultural exports that meet international sanitary and phytosanitary requirements. As the tool has
now been in operation for some years, it is increasingly becoming important to engage in its
“maintenance” to ensure it remains up to date.
Pillar 2 deals with Strengthening of the evidence and risk basis of official food controls: the shift of the
modern food safety conception from “reactive” to “preventive”, has led governments worldwide moving
towards risk-based approaches to food control activities and requiring all operators in the food supply
chain to bear primary responsibility for food safety. Food inspection programs need to prioritize controls
based on effective risks posed by the food or food operator practices. Planning food inspection based on
risk can be particularly beneficial to developing and transition economies as they make better use of
existing resources by allocating them toward processes and businesses presenting the greatest potential
health risk to consumers and by implementing enforcement action proportionate to the level of risk. In
turns, this also minimizes costs to food operators by reducing unnecessary inspection and testing costs.
A complementary instrument to inspection plans, monitoring (and sampling) programmes are often
overseen by developing countries, as the concepts underlying their basis need to be unpacked. The
scientific advice publications by JECFA and JEMRA, as well as Codex Alimentarius guidelines provide
useful guidance, which would benefit to be supplemented by more practical considerations allowing
countries to replace this guidance into their context."
10811422,"ABSTRACT
Depressive and anxiety disorders are among the leading contributors to the global disease burden and are
more common in women compared to men. Among women in low-resource contexts, such as low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs), exposure to adversities (e.g., poverty, intimate partner violence, negative life events
such as illness or loss) is a powerful risk factor for developing internalizing symptoms (i.e., depressive and
anxiety symptoms). Dysregulated activity in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis may be a
mechanism underlying the onset of internalizing disorders and a novel adjunct target for mental health
interventions in addition to psychological symptoms. However, there is little evidence of the long-term effects of
mental health interventions on either psychological symptoms or HPA axis dysregulation. In addition, more
research is needed to characterize the dynamic role of adverse experiences in shaping women’s internalizing
symptoms and HPA axis activity over time, especially in South Asia, where women may have unique familial
social contexts compared to western counterparts. This work is essential for establishing and improving the
long-term effectiveness of mental health interventions globally. In this R21, we propose leveraging multi-year
experimental and observational data from the Bachpan study, an ongoing longitudinal birth cohort with an
embedded cluster randomized control trial of a maternal depression intervention delivered in rural Pakistan.
Specifically, we will test the effects the intervention on HPA axis regulation and internalizing symptoms 6 years
after intervention onset, as well as whether HPA axis activity mediates the effect of the intervention on
internalizing symptoms. We will also examine how adversity exposure, including chronic adversity experienced
over a six-year period, retrospectively reported childhood adversity, and recent adversity, relate to HPA axis
activity and internalizing symptoms. As part of this analysis, we will also examine how within-person changes in
adversity relate to within-person changes in HPA axis activity and internalizing symptoms over time. The rich,
multi-year dataset includes information on multiple domains of women’s mental health and adverse
experiences, as well as hair-derived HPA axis hormones (cortisol and DHEA). The major public health
contribution of this project is that it will generate knowledge on the longitudinal predictors of stress system
dysregulation and internalizing symptoms among women in a low resource context, as well as the potential
ameliorating role of psychosocial intervention."

Tick-borne diseases, including Spotted Fever Group Rickettsiosis, are rising due to climatic
changes and are predicted to increase. The increase in rickettsiosis is a significant threat to public
health in the absence of preventive measures. Tick hemocytes (immune cells) are mammalian
leukocytes' functional equivalent and limit ticks' capacity to transmit human pathogens through
phagocytosis, encapsulation, secretion of immune factors, and immune priming. The ixodid ticks
rely on an efficient innate immune system for protection against invading microbes, in which
hemocytes play a crucial role. Tick cellular immunity is primarily a neglected and unexplored field
of vector biology. A complete understanding of the immune factors involved in the interactions
between ticks and tick-borne pathogens in hemocytes is crucial to elucidate their role in vector
competence and to help identify novel targets for developing new strategies to block pathogen
transmission. This study aims to build technologies by realizing the potential of exploiting tick
hemocyte biology. We began addressing this need, and our compelling preliminary data show the
immune cell types and complexity in the uninfected and Rickettsia parkeri-infected ticks. Bulk
RNA-seq analysis of uninfected and infected tick hemocytes showed that out of 39,429 coding
sequences, 7.3% were differentially expressed and classified as related to immune genes. We
hypothesize that Rickettsia parkeri manipulates the Amblyomma maculatum phagocytic immune
cells to facilitate systemic dissemination and enhance vertical transmission. To address these
questions, we will examine Amblyomma maculatum immune cell populations from uninfected and
infected (Rickettsia parkeri-infected) conditions through the following specific aims: 1) To
generate single-cell RNA sequencing from uninfected and Rickettsia parkeri-infected hemocytes
for downstream analyses, and 2) To dissect the role of hemocyte-specific marker genes in cellular
immunity and vector competence by RNA interference approach. In this high-risk, high-reward
application, these aims will provide critical reagents, tools, and data to address critical gaps in
fundamental knowledge of tick immune cell biology and vector competence. These studies will
provide critical data to address gaps in fundamental knowledge of tick immune cell biology and
vector competence. This exploratory project will also provide an opportunity to develop new tools
to study hemocyte biology. Additionally, the outcome of this project could be extrapolated to other
tick species of public health significance and is expected to provide a critical comparative
understanding of invertebrate immunology."
10812086,"Liver cirrhosis results from long-term continuous damage to the liver leading to irreversible buildup of scar tissue impairing liver function. Cirrhosis can occur as a consequence of various chronic liver diseases including alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. One of the most serious complications of cirrhosis is hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a pathological state characterized by neurological deficits that significantly impair quality of life and overall prognosis. Furthermore, these neurological impairments can be irreversible, persisting after resolution of liver injury. Our current understanding of the events leading to the development of HE is limited, resulting in limited therapeutic options which ultimately leads to poor patient outcomes and generates significant challenges for the US healthcare system.
We have recently demonstrated that cholesterol accumulation plays a role in the development of HE due to acute liver failure. However, whether a similar phenomenon can be observed during liver cirrhosis is unknown. The objective of this proposal is to assess the dysregulation in brain cholesterol homeostasis, and the subsequent effects of aberrant neurosteroid synthesis, during HE in models of liver cirrhosis. Based upon strong preliminary data, we propose the novel central hypothesis that during liver cirrhosis there is an accumulation of free and membrane-bound cholesterol in the brain during HE, due to a dysregulation of pathways involved in cholesterol clearance. The excess cholesterol increases neurosteroid synthesis, which depresses neural activity and contributes to the pathogenesis of HE. Three specific aims have been designed to test this working hypothesis:
1) Cholesterol accumulation in the brain contributes to the neurological deficits associated with HE;
2) HE-associated suppresses of cholesterol clearance pathways in the brain is regulated by farnesoid X receptor signaling;
3) Increased brain cholesterol is associated with an aberrant increase in neurosteroid synthesis pathways.
With the completion of the proposed studies, we will understand the molecular pathology contributing to the progression of HE in the context of liver cirrhosis. This knowledge will lead to novel therapeutic targets for drug development. This would greatly benefit the US healthcare system by decreasing patient morbidity and mortality, improving patient quality of life, and reducing medical expenditures."

Poverty is the most widely studied fundamental determinant of maternal mental health, morbidity, mortality,
and inequities in the U.S. and worldwide. Low absolute and relative income and low socioeconomic status are
associated with financial hardship, food and housing insecurity, discrimination, limited healthcare access, other
social stressors, and subsequent depression during the preconception, perinatal, postpartum, and parenting
years; effects are disproportionately adverse for racial and ethnic minority, rural-residing, and other structurally
disadvantaged groups of women. Public policies that shape the social conditions in which women live, notably
those that assure economic resources and supports during the early childbearing years, can set life-long
trajectories of maternal and child wellbeing. Thus, economic security laws have strong potential as public
health interventions for women’s mental health and health equity; yet the most timely and promising state-level
laws within the dynamic, complex policy landscape over the last two decades have not been collectively or
rigorously evaluated. The goal of this R01 is to empirically test the effects of six state-level economic security
policies targeting low-income women on maternal mental health outcomes and disparities across the U.S. over
the last 20 years. We focus on Paid Family Leave, Paid Medical Leave, Child Care and Development Fund,
Earned Income Tax Credits, Minimum Wage, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. First, we will use
our team’s validated novel legal measurement, analysis, and mapping methods to conduct a detailed state-
year-level policy surveillance study of the six economic policies across all 50 states and Washington D.C. from
2000 to 2023. Second, we will estimate the independent effects of each economic security policy (and specific
dimensions of each policy) on a range of mental health indicators spanning the preconception, perinatal,
postpartum, and parenting periods among U.S. women ages 18 to 45. We will use a rigorous quasi-
experimental approach (difference-in-differences), exploiting state-year-level policy variation and six different
population datasets, to provide causal estimates and maximize statistical power. We will examine differences
in policy effects by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, rurality/urbanicity, and age. Third, we will use
interaction analyses to test whether combinations of economic security policies have greater impact than each
alone and determine which policy combinations have the greatest effects on maternal mental health outcomes
and for which groups. Fourth, we will use mediation analysis to test whether economic outcomes, health care
access, psychosocial and behavioral outcomes, and social stressors are mechanisms linking the economic
policies to health. This research will substantially advance our understanding of how social policies can be
optimally used for population maternal health promotion. Findings will guide policymakers toward evidence-
based policy interventions at a critical time in U.S. history when public health crises of mental health morbidity,
maternal mortality, and poverty are colliding for childbearing women of structural disadvantage."

This proposal is a competing renewal application for a T35 short term medical student summer training
program in environmental health science research that has been funded by NIEHS for 15 years. The Specific
Aims are: 1) To provide hands-on training in basic and clinical environmental health-based research to medical
students in a structured, mentored environment; 2) To provide an interactive, educational experience that
introduces medical students to the fundamental skills necessary for basic, translational, and clinical
Environmental Health Sciences-based research. The Distinction in Research Track (DIR), a feature added in
the previous award period, enhances training for our students to function as environmental health sciences
specialists in an academic health center setting. This NIEHS T35 training program encourages students to
participate in the DIR for a continued longitudinal research experience in the 2nd – 4th years of medical training,
allowing them to develop research-oriented skills to complete a clinical or translational research project in the
third/fourth years. Publication of peer-reviewed articles, as some trainees have achieved, as well as the
strength of residency training and first permanent position as physician-scientists are tracked as outcomes.
The program will support training of 8 second year medical students in environmental health sciences research
topics related to chemical exposure induced chronic diseases including diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, obesity, cancer and hormonal regulation of metabolism. UofL medical students in the top half of the
first year class choose from research projects submitted by 23 mentors in the Schools of Medicine and Public
Health (ranking them 1-5 for interest). Trainees to be appointed to the T35 training grant are selected after in-
person meetings between trainees and mentors to assure `fit'. A successful effort has been made to recruit
students from underrepresented minorities and disadvantaged backgrounds. During the 11-week summer
training, students work with mentors on their research project in clinical or laboratory settings and complete
training in the Responsible Conduct of Research (topics include: reproducibility, fabrication and falsification of
data, plagiarism, managing scientific data, publication practices, mentorship, responsible authorship,
stewardship, conflict of interest). Trainees working with human subjects complete human subject and IRB
training prior to beginning their research. Trainees who use vertebrate animals in mentors' labs complete and
pass IACUC training courses. All trainees will attend a weekly “Environmental Health Sciences Conference”
designed to introduce clinical and translational research in environmental health sciences to T35 trainees. The
conference culminates with each Trainee presenting his/her research project to peers and mentors. Trainees
also present the results of their research as posters with peers at a School of Medicine week-long research
celebration that includes nationally recognized physician-scientists as keynote speakers. Poster contest
Winners are eligible to attend the National Student Research Forum the following Spring."
10805355,"07 Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term goal of this project is to interrogate the dynamics of membrane voltage in the context of intact
brains with high spatiotemporal resolution. Optical methods to dissect neuronal activity promise to revolutionize
our understanding of the brain at the cellular and circuit level; however, our understanding remains incomplete
due, in part, to a lack of tools that can report directly on neuronal activity with sufficient speed and sensitivity.
We propose to use the power of molecular design and organic chemistry to develop and apply new optical tools
for monitoring membrane potential with unprecedented speed and sensitivity in intact brains and without
disruptive capacitive load associated with other classes of voltage indicators. We plan to exploit photoinduced
electron transfer (PeT) through molecular wires as a versatile platform for optical voltage sensing. We will build
a palette of colors for optical voltage sensing that extends into the near infrared regions of the electromagnetic
spectrum; we will create new voltage sensors with exceptionally high two-photon absorption cross sections for
use in thick tissue and intact brains; and we will explore methods for genetically targeting and localizing ultra-
sensitive fluorescent voltage sensors to neurons of interest. Throughout, development of molecular tools will be
closely wed to applications in neurons and tissues, and we will apply these tools to understand how membrane
potential dynamics change in both healthy and neurological disease states."
10801423,"ABSTRACT
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Over the past few decades, there have been
extensive investigations and enormous research efforts to find better therapies for stroke patients. However,
many strategies that are effective in animal models have proven ineffective in clinical trials. Thus, tissue
plasminogen activator (tPA) is still the only FDA-approved drug for stroke. The lack of successful bench-to-clinic
translation is mainly due to two reasons, with one being the complexity of the pathology of stroke, which includes
a multiplex of signaling pathways, various cell types, and both local and systemic inflammatory responses.
Secondly, the prevailing clinical conditions in patients, such as hyperlipidemia, are not included in animal models
of stroke. We propose that a pleiotropic target which can integrate multiple critical components in various cell
types will be the key to developing effective stroke therapies by using clinically relevant animal models. In this
proposal, we propose that the oxidative stress activated Ca2+-permeable TRPM2 can serve as this pleiotropic
target for developing effective stroke therapies. The goal of this proposal is to investigate whether (Aim 1) and
how (Aim2) TRPM2 plays a vital role in ischemic injury cascade, and to determine whether TRPM2 may serve
as a pleiotropic target for ischemic stroke using the classical stroke model (Aim 1) and a clinically relevant stroke
model (Aim 3). We will use state-of-the-art multidisciplinary approaches to test our hypothesis. Successful
completion of this proposal will not only prove the concept that a pleiotropic target represents a new strategy for
developing effective therapies for ischemic stroke, but also will provide profound insights into translational
implications of developing new stroke treatment by targeting TRPM2."
10804261,"The goal of the application is to define the interaction among superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), adenosine
monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and catalase in modulating liver injury induced by ethanol
exposure. Additionally, there is a strong link between alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and adipose tissue
dysfunction. Although SOD1 is known to inhibit the progression of ALD, very little is known regarding
mechanisms involved in mediating the hepatoprotective effects of SOD1. Thus, there is an urgent need to define
mechanisms by which SOD1 modulates ALD and to develop novel therapies to ameliorate this alcohol-related
morbidity. Central to our hypothesis is that SOD1-mediated redox regulation of AMPK and catalase inhibits
exosome biogenesis and/or promotes ethanol clearance, thereby attenuating ALD, and that a novel mannose
receptor-targeted SOD1 nanoparticles (Man-Nano), is an effective agent in attenuating ALD. The studies will
employ genetic, molecular, and pharmacological approaches to examine the interplay among SOD1, AMPK
signaling, and catalase in modulating ALD and to demonstrate the effectiveness of Man-Nano in ameliorating
ALD. We hypothesize that SOD1 increases intracellular H2O2 thereby increasing AMPK/catalase activities
in hepatocytes and/or adipocytes, which contribute to the protective effects of SOD1 against ALD. We
will test this hypothesis by manipulating levels of SOD1 in hepatocytes and adipocytes as presented in the
following three aims. In the first aim, we will use hepatocyte-specific SOD1 knock-out mice to determine the role
and mechanisms of hepatocyte SOD1 in modulating ethanol-induced liver injury. Studies in Aim 2 will employ
adipocyte-specific SOD1 knock-out mice to determine the role and mechanisms of adipocyte SOD1 in
modulating ethanol-induced adipose tissue and liver injury. In our last aim, we will determine the efficacy and
mechanism of action of Man-Nano in ameliorating ethanol-induced liver and adipose tissue injury. Overall, this
project will provide critical information regarding the novel mechanism(s) by which SOD1 attenuates ALD.
Completion of this project will also yield insight into the therapeutic impact of a novel antioxidant-based therapy
(i.e. Man-Nano) in ameliorating ethanol-induced organ injury."

Cell identity is largely determined by specific epigenetic landscapes and transcriptional networks. Ameloblast is
the only epithelial cell that can generate calcified tissue during development, where preameloblasts (PABs) first
differentiate to the secretory ameloblasts (SABs) that synthesize and deposit enamel matrix proteins (EMPs) to
scaffold organic matrix, and then to the maturation ameloblasts (MABs) that hydrolyze, endocytose EMPs, and
transport ions to mineralize enamel. To bioengineer enamel, a nonregenerative tissue, we must understand the
transcriptional regulation of ameloblasts that has been limited due to a loss of ameloblasts after the tooth
eruption and a lack of cell line fully recapitulating the characteristics of ameloblasts. Previous fundings allow us
to establish a novel and comprehensive list of genes significant to each developmental stage of ameloblasts
across species and to explore the functions of chromatin organizer SATB1, and enamel matrix modeling
regulators -peptidase KLK4 and the major calcium transporter NCKX4- in the context of ameloblast
differentiation. These efforts resulted in a discovery that SATB1, KLK4, and NCKX4 all contribute to the
transcriptional regulation of ameloblastin (Ambn) and enamelin (Enam), encoding the major EMPs co-
upregulated in SABs and then co-downregulated in MABs. We found that ablation of SATB1, highly expressed
in PABs, repressed Ambn & Enam transcription and H3K27ac level. Our organ culture showed that elevated
histone acetylation upregulated Ambn & Enam. An enhancer and base unpairing region (BUR, selective
SATB1 DNA binding site) have been predicted in the vicinity of Ambn & Enam. These data suggest that
SATB1 organizes chromatin conformation and poises a transcriptional complex to upregulate Ambn & Enam to
advance PABs to SABs. In the case of mice lacking Klk4 and Nckx4—the causative genes for amelogenesis
imperfecta—we found a retention of proline/glutamine (P/G)-rich EMPs resulting from defective hydrolysis.
These Nckx4-/- and Klk4-/- MABs had upregulated Ambn & Enam and downregulated Hif1a. In vitro studies
showed that P/G-rich peptides downregulated Ambn & Enam and upregulated Hif1a. Our RNA-seq analyses
revealed that HIF1A, a transcription factor regulating cell responses to oxidative stress, had a 6-fold
upregulation in MABs vs SABs, reflecting MAB’s robust anti-oxidative capacity to continuously provide energy
for ion transport and protein degradation. These data suggest that retake of P/G-rich peptides upregulate
Hif1a, which in turn downregulate Ambn & Enam. Our in vivo and in vitro studies allow us to hypothesize that
the dynamic expression of Ambn & Enam in the two major functional stages of ameloblasts is coordinately
regulated by distinct factors chromatin organizer SATB1 and transcription factor HIF1A. This hypothesis will be
addressed by specific aim 1: To determine the roles of SATB1 as a pioneer factor in PABs to poise the
enhancer establishment for activating the transcription of Ambn & Enam gene in SABs; and specific aim 2: To
determine the regulatory roles of HIF1A on Ambn & Enam expression and enamel formation."

Despite rising incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and
ulcerative colitis, in Hispanic population in the United States, there is limited understanding of the natural
history and treatment outcomes for this vulnerable population, who are vastly underrepresented in clinical
trials. The principal investigator’s (PI) long-term goal is to inform evidence-based management of IBD in
Hispanic population, using large-scale epidemiologic studies and novel comparative effectiveness research
using real world data. The overall objectives of this proposal are to understand patterns and drivers of disease
and treatment outcomes in Hispanic patients with IBD, specifically focusing on social and structural
determinants (SDoH) and biological determinants of health. The central hypothesis is that Hispanic patients
experience a complicated IBD course with high disease burden and inferior treatment outcomes, driven
primarily by adverse SDoH, rather than biological differences in treatment effectiveness. The rationale for this
proposal is that a comprehensive epidemiological assessment of the natural history, social and biological
predictors of outcomes and real-world comparative effectiveness and safety of targeted immunomodulator
(TIM) therapies in Hispanic patients with IBD will directly and decisively inform management of IBD in a timely
manner in this population just as the disease is at an inflection point in the US. The central hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) characterize natural history and treatment outcomes, and compare
the effectiveness and safety of TIMs, in Hispanic patients with IBD using large-scale epidemiologic studies and
novel target trial emulation methodology; (2) understand impact of area-level SDoH and patient-level social risk
factors on adverse disease and treatment outcomes in Hispanic patients; and (3) understand the impact of
specific genetic (HLA-DQA1*05 variants) and tissue transcriptomic (oncostatin M) factors on treatment
outcomes with TIMs in Hispanic patients with IBD. The context for this proposal is a contemporary, electronic
health record-based registry of patients with IBD seen at 7 large health systems in California with ~14,000
Hispanic patients that the investigator team have developed, a large commercial insurance claims database
(OptumLabs Data Warehouse, ~18,000 Hispanic patients with IBD), and robust infrastructure of an established
Cedars Genetics Research Center and biorepositories at UCSD. These large cohorts allow for efficient and
cost-effective large-scale analysis in this health disparity population. The research proposed in this application
is innovative, utilizing tools of applied clinical informatics, innovative causal inference methodology and
combined evaluation of biological and non-biological determinants of health, to conduct the largest study on
Hispanic patients with IBD in the United States. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to
fill a key evidence gap in understanding the natural history and treatment outcomes in Hispanic patients with
IBD, providing timely information on evidence-based management."
10804251,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A major hurdle in the clinical management of pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PDAC) is the profound resistance to
chemotherapeutics exhibited by these tumors. PDAC chemoresistance is mediated by the tumor
microenvironment (TME) as isolated PDAC cells cultured ex vivo readily respond to therapies while PDAC cells
in tumors do not. Thus, identifying the TME factors and mechanisms by which the TME regulates drug response
in PDAC is critical to being able to effectively treat this disease. Towards the goal of identifying TME factors
regulating PDAC biology, we have taken the strategy of measuring physiological parameters in the PDAC TME
and recreating these conditions ex vivo to study in mechanistic detail how PDAC cells are impacted by TME
physiology. As part of this approach, we recently developed techniques to isolate interstitial fluid (the local
perfusate) from PDAC tumors and quantitative metabolite profiling techniques to measure availability of ~150
major nutrients in the PDAC TME. This provided us with the first quantitative atlas of nutrient availability in PDAC
and we found that local nutrient abundance in these tumors was strikingly different than in the bulk circulation or
healthy tissues. To study how abnormal access to nutrients in the TME could impact PDAC cells, we developed
a novel cell culture model in which PDAC cells are cultured with the precise levels of ~120 major vitamins and
nutrients they encounter in the native TME. Using this model, we found that PDAC cells exposed to TME nutrition
exhibit resistance to a wide array of clinically used chemotherapies, identifying abnormal tumor nutrient
availability as a critical TME factor mediating chemoresistance in this disease. Further analysis of TME nutrient-
induced chemoresistant phenotype indicated that: (1) increased availability of the amino acid glycine in the TME
causes PDAC cells to become highly chemoresistance and (2) TME glycine does not endow PDAC cells with
the ability to evade action of chemotherapies, but rather the ability to tolerate damage induced by therapeutic
challenges. Based on these preliminary studies, we developed the hypothesis that TME glycine impairs the
ability of PDAC cells to undergo cell death in response to chemotherapeutic insult, thus enabling PDAC cells to
tolerate chemotherapeutic treatment. In this proposal, we will determine: (1) the metabolic basis for how glycine
accumulates in the PDAC TME and if targeting TME glycine availability can sensitize PDAC tumors to
chemotherapy and (2) the mechanism by which PDAC cells gain tolerance to chemotherapeutic stress and if
targeting these tolerance mechanisms can synergize with chemotherapy. Therapy resistance is a major
contributor to the poor prognosis of PDAC patients. Our work addresses this key therapeutic challenge in a
disease with much unmet clinical need and could identify novel therapeutic options for PDAC patients."

This goal of this project is to develop computer simulations of combination therapy for aggressive lymphomas,
and apply them to understand past positive and negative trials, and to enable model-guided design of new
regimens. Theoretical models of cancer drug response and resistance evolution have provided many
conceptual insights, but models of a `representative' tumor have not been able to predict response distributions
in heterogeneous human populations. We recently developed simulations which use clinically observed
distributions of single-drug responses to predict distributions of multi-drug responses. These models have been
validated by accurately predicting many trial results in solid cancers (9 FDA approvals), but our prior models
were too simple to describe curative treatments because they lacked intra-tumor heterogeneity and kinetics.
Here we propose conceptual and technical advances to model the complexity of curative therapies, using
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) as a case study. Our simulations of multi-drug response will consider
inter-patient and intra-tumor heterogeneity, tolerability and dosage, treatment schedule and response kinetics,
and drug interactions. We adopt the conceptual approach of population-pharmacokinetics, where each
parameter has a distribution describing its variance among patients. We will apply this approach to tumor drug
response, considering both intra-tumor and inter-patient variation. Parameter distributions are informed by our
experimental data from clone tracing and liquid biopsies to quantify clonal heterogeneity and response kinetics,
and digitization of decades of trial data. Aim 1 will analyze past and current trials of drug combinations in first-
line DLBCL to test whether the clinical efficacy of drug combinations is predictable from single drug efficacy.
Preliminary data shows the past 20 years of novel combination trials in first-line DLBCL confirm model
accuracy, and we prospectively predicted the first success in 2 decades. This aim will produce predictive
models that can help design future drug combinations. Aim 2 will investigate explanations for the negative
result of trial that added a targeted therapy, ibrutinib, to standard chemotherapy. We will model the influence of
tolerability and dose reductions, enrollment bias, and treatment schedule, comparing model outputs with real-
world analyses of how these factors affect outcome. By understanding causes of trial failures this aim can help
future trial designs to overcome these problems. In Aim 3 we will collaborate with the ECOG-ACRIN trial group
to apply model-guided design to a trial of precision combination therapy in first-line DLBCL. The LymphoMatch
trial aims to match 5 subtypes of DLBCL to 5 targeted therapies, combined with standard chemotherapy. We
will use clinical data on single drug efficacies, combination tolerability, subtypes' prognoses, and accuracy of
subtypes as biomarkers of drug sensitivities, to forecast trial results and so optimize design of regimens and
endpoints. This research will deliver innovative multi-scale models of tumor heterogeneity, to solve challenges
in the design of novel combination therapies and clinical trials that aim to cure more cases of lymphoma."

Emergency medical services (EMS) represent a critical facet of the public health infrastructure that will be
increasingly stressed by climate change, but the U.S.-wide burden on EMS systems associated with
environmental exposures remains unknown. Due to inherent limitations of the administrative health data, prior
works examining short-term effects of environmental exposures have assumed constant exposures over
delineated locations (such as census tracts) and times (usually a day), which could lead to exposure significant
misclassification and bias in the risk estimates. In this study, we will leverage a national database of 911 calls,
the National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS), to test the hypothesis that short-term
air pollution and temperature exposures are associated with EMS transports. NEMSIS has information on the
patient demographics as well as the location and times of EMS activations across all 50 states. This detail,
size, and nationwide coverage of NEMSIS make the dataset uniquely suitable for characterizing the exposure-
response relationships across multiple populations in the U.S. at varying geographic and temporal scales. Our
aims are to: 1) construct a highly resolved spatiotemporal data architecture linking 911 calls with environmental
exposures (fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, temperature average, temperature variability), built
environment, and neighborhood characteristics for years 2017-2022+; 2) evaluate the U.S.-wide short-term
associations between environmental exposures and cause-specific EMS transports (all-cause, cardiovascular,
respiratory, temperature-related, and injuries); and 3) examine the associations between exposures and EMS
outcomes in select urban areas incorporating spatiotemporally dynamic exposure estimates derived from low-
cost sensors and population mobility datasets. This proposed project evaluates the nationwide risks for EMS
transports associated with air pollution and temperature exposures for the first time. This work will also allow
us to measure the impact of exposure misclassification by leveraging recent advancements in exposure
assessment tools and unique information in EMS data on event locations and times."
10803224,"The obesity epidemic is a major public health problem, contributing to various comorbid medical conditions,
including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and brain disturbances. The proposed project is designed to
delineate mechanisms underlying the effects of severe obesity on brain health and cognition in the context of
bariatric surgery induced weight loss. Besides causing dramatic weight loss in many patients, bariatric surgery
alters systemic metabolic and vascular function, including altering insulin and glucose metabolism. We have
shown cognitive and neurophysiological benefits of bariatric surgery including enhanced cerebral metabolic
and hemodynamic function tied to reductions in A1C and BMI. Improvements in insulin-glucose regulation are
significant factors in brain health. Findings from the parent R01 (WISE-01) support our earlier findings of
improved cognitive function at 3 months and 18 months post-surgery. We further see changes in fMRI
functional connectivity in brain networks known to be critical in cognitive functions and cerebral metabolic
milieu such that reduced BMI and A1C are associated with lower brain inflammatory markers (MRS). We also
showed that markers of brain function and metabolic states prior to bariatric surgery predict BMI and A1C
reductions. Furthermore, white matter integrity prior to surgery is predictive of cognitive improvement post-
surgery. Our past findings provide compelling evidence linking systemic, cerebral metabolic, and brain function
with successful weight loss and diabetes improvements, but several important clinically and scientifically
significant questions remain. The extent to which improvements in cognition and brain function persist over
longer periods is unknown, motivating the proposed investigation’s Aim 1, an additional assessment of these
factors in WISE-01 participants at >36 months after bariatric surgery. There are multiple mechanisms by which
obesity, weight loss, and, specifically bariatric surgery may affect brain and systemic health. Amongst these,
vagus nerve contributions are compelling as the vagus is a major conduit by which information is conveyed
from the gut to and from the brain. The vagus is commonly cut during bariatric surgery and further, stimulation
methods (e.g., transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation [tVNS]) have promise in affecting physiology relevant
to weight loss impacts on brain and systemic health. Thus, in Aims 2 and 3, we will prospectively assess the
impact of both of these vagus manipulations on brain/cognitive and systemic health post bariatric surgery (pre-
surgery, 3- and 18- months post-surgery). In Aim 2, the effects of cutting and sparing the anterior vagus during
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) will be assessed. In Aim 3, the effects of tVNS starting three months post-
RYGB will be assessed. These three aims will substantially increase our knowledge of longitudinal effects of
bariatric surgery on brain and systemic health as well as the role of the vagus in neurophysiological changes
associated with RYGB. This new knowledge may lead to better biomarkers of likely brain and cognitive
outcomes of bariatric surgery as well as potential clinical treatment considerations relevant to these factors."
10803293,"Arsenic exposure is a worldwide environmental health problem causing multiple chronic diseases including
cancer. Cancer results from mutations in, and epigenetic modifications of, oncogenes and tumor suppressor
genes. The molecular mechanisms driving arsenic (iAs)-induced carcinogenesis are likely a complex interplay
of multiple factors contributing to yet unidentified genetic changes responsible for tumorigenesis. One
mechanism is the epigenetic effect of miRNA dysregulation. iAs-exposure induces chromosomal instability
(CIN) and CIN contributes to carcinogenesis. We focused on mechanism and effects of overexpression of hsa-
miR-186 on CIN in the previous funding period. miR-186 is an intronic miRNA and is overexpressed in iAs-
induced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The parent gene encodes an alternative mRNA splicing factor that
is disrupted by iAs-exposure. miR-186 overexpression in human keratinocytes suppresses two mitotic
regulators and gives rise to aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancer. This investigation led to establishment of a new
human keratinocyte model for iAs-induced carcinogenesis using Ker-CT cells that is more amenable to
karyotype analysis necessary to analyze CIN for leads into carcinogenic mutations. We identified 5 additional
miRNAs that are overexpressed in iAs-induced SCC and also in human keratinocytes (HaCaT) chronically
exposed to low dose iAs. These miRNAs are predicted to target multiple proteins also targeted by known
oncogenic miRNAs. This continuation application focuses on miRNAs dysregulated in iAs-induced SCC and
proposes to identify additional miR-186 targets contributing to CIN and to characterize the impact of the
additional 5 overexpressed miRNAs on carcinogenesis. The hypothesis underlying these studies is that
dysregulation of RNA metabolism contributes to iAs-induced carcinogenesis by modulating gene expression
and inducing CIN. The specific aims are: 1) Determine the mechanism of hsa-miR-186 overexpression
inducing aneuploidy and CIN in new Ker-CT model; 2) Characterize the new Ker-CT model of iAs-induced skin
carcinogenesis; 3) Investigate role in cellular transformation of miRNAs common to SCC and arsenite-exposed
HaCaT cells. Mutations in cancer genes in cells transformed by miR-186 overexpression and arsenic
exposure will be characterized providing information to fill a knowledge gap. Demonstrating that these miRNAs
overexpressed in human iAs-induced SCC share targets with known oncogenic miRNAs will establish an
epigenetic mechanism and be a major step forward in our understanding of the mechanism of iAs-induced
carcinogenesis, thus filling a critical knowledge gap in our understanding. The principles learned will provide a
translational framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms operative in iAs-induced carcinogenesis
in other tissues and cell types. Identification of mutations in, or epigenetic silencing of, cancer genes induced
by iAs exposure will be a major step forward in our understanding of the mechanism of iAs-induced
carcinogenesis."

 Skin necrosis over implants is a major complication in facial plastics reconstruction over
implants (nasal and auricular reconstruction), craniofacial skeletal implants (e.g. chin implants)
and spinal scoliosis hardware. These complications have severe clinical implications, including
infection, the need for implant removal, requirement for multiple additional surgeries and skin
grafting. In fact, skin dehiscence over auricular implants is a major reason that much more
complex and difficult rib grafts are used for auricular reconstruction. Although it is widely
postulated that high stress and compression ischemia are responsible for skin ischemia, no
quantitative investigations of vascular compromise nor skin damage have been performed.
Such quantitative measures are necessary to better design mitigation methods for skin
dehiscence over auricular and other implants placed under the skin. It is hypothesized here that
high skin stress initiates compression induced skin ischemia that leads to adverse skin
remodeling and loss of mechanical properties, finally resulting in skin dehiscence and
implant/scaffold exposure. It is further hypothesized that finite element damage modeling
predictions will correlate with in vivo skin damage, and thus will be a useful tool to design
methods for skin dehiscence. In this proposal, continuum damage finite element modeling,
photoacoustic tomography, and ultrasound elastography will be used to make in vivo
measurements to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, 3D print porous implants of two different
topologies will be printed with different finite element predicted damage predictions to determine
if this leads to different in vivo ischemia and damage distributions, establishing quantitative
measures/correlations between FE model predicted damage and in vivo skin damage. In Aim 2,
these in vivo measurements will be applied to determine how will structural versus structural
plus biologic dehiscence mitigation measures compare in a large Yucatan miniswine model.
Additionally, the in vivo measurements will be related to continuum damage nonlinear FE model
predictions. The results of this proposal will lead to modeling procedures to design better
implants that reduce dehiscence complications and imaging methods that can be used to
predict which patients may be most at risk for suffering dehiscence complications."

Differentiating enterocytes build ~3000 microvilli on their apical surface and organize these protrusions into an
array referred to as the brush border (BB). BB microvilli exhibit perfect tight packing and this unique morphology
is critical for maximizing the number of protrusions, the holding capacity for membrane associated transporters
and channels, and in turn, the functional capacity of the cell. The physiological importance of the BB is
underscored by the fact that numerous intestinal diseases that are linked to the destruction and/or malformation
of microvilli. Our group has made fundamental discoveries on mechanisms that enterocytes use to organize
microvilli into functional, ordered BB arrays. Groundbreaking studies from our group identified two BB-specific
protocadherins, CDHR2 and CDHR5, which form a heterophilic intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC) that
links the tips of adjacent microvilli and promotes ordered packing on mature villus enterocytes. Importantly, our
work with CDHR2 KO mice established that loss of IMAC function leads to ~35% fewer microvilli on the apical
surface and a corresponding growth rate reduction at the whole animal level. How IMACs drive the accumulation
of thousands of microvilli over time during enterocyte differentiation remains the critical open question that we
will tackle in this proposal. In exciting preliminary ultrastructural studies, we discovered that crypt microvilli initially
exhibit robust accumulation at cell margins, which implies the existence of a mechanism for anchoring nascent
protrusions at these sites. We also observed similar marginal accumulation of microvilli on the surface of
differentiating intestinal and kidney epithelial cell lines. In all models examined, microvilli extending from one cell
span intercellular space to make physical contact with microvilli on a neighboring cell. Remarkably, super-
resolution microscopy of native tissue and epithelial culture models showed that microvilli in these contacts
contain both CDHR2 and CDHR5, suggesting they represent transjunctional IMACs, a novel form of epithelial
cell-cell contact. Using a cell mixing approach to drive the formation of transjunctional IMACs, photobleaching
measurements revealed that transjunctional IMACs are much longer lived vs. medial IMACs. Finally, we learned
that CDHR2 loss-of-function models, which are unable to form IMACs, exhibit defects in tight junctions. These
initial findings lead us to propose the following hypothesis: transjunctional IMACs drive the accumulation of
nascent microvilli into a mature BB while promoting the integrity of canonical cell junctions. Using state-of-the-
art microscopy and novel epithelial model systems, we will: (Aim 1) define the subcellular mechanism of IMAC
formation, (Aim 2) determine if transjunctional IMACs promote microvillus accumulation, and (Aim 3) determine
if transjunctional IMACs promote the integrity of canonical cell junctions. These studies will reveal how the
enterocyte surface becomes maximally packed with microvilli over the full time-course of differentiation and in
doing so, offer new paradigms for understanding apical morphogenesis."

Chronic respiratory diseases including pulmonary fibrosis (PF) are substantial causes of morbidity and
mortality among veteran populations. Most patients with progressive PF die of respiratory failure or require
lung transplantation within 5 years of diagnosis, and currently available therapies only modestly slow disease
progression, underscoring an urgent need for new and more effective therapies that halt disease progression
and/or promote functional lung regeneration. Dysfunctional repair of the alveolar epithelium following
recurrent/chronic injury has been hypothesized as central to PF pathogenesis, and our prior work and
preliminary data demonstrate that that lung epithelium in PF is characterized by accumulation of cells in
abnormal differentiation states similar to regeneration-associated transitional cells observed in mice,
suggesting that persistence of typically transient cell-states may be driver of disease pathogenesis. Using
single-cell transcriptomics, genetic lineage-tracing studies, recurrent injury-models together with human and
mouse organoid models, our preliminary data demonstrate that there is aberrant and persistent activation of
hypoxia-inducible-factor-2 (Hif2) in the distal lung epithelium following recurrent injury. Preventing or blocking
Hif2 activity protects against proximal-like epithelial metaplasia and experimental lung fibrosis and enhances
alveolar epithelial cell maturation. We hypothesize that recurrent injury to regenerating airway-derived
progenitor cells prevents AEC maturation via persistent activation of HIF2, which cooperates with the
ETS family of transcription factors to direct ectopic “proximal-like” cell fates and potentiate local
profibrotic signaling. Our specific aims are: 1) To test whether targeted Hif-inhibition can ameliorate
experimental lung fibrosis, 2) To investigate the mechanisms through which localized Hif-activation regulates
niche-specific profibrotic signaling, and 3) To determine whether HIF2:ETS interactions mediate HIF-regulation
of regenerating epithelial cell fate and profibrotic signaling. Integrating transgenic mouse models, human and
mouse organoid studies, and state-of-the-art spatial-transcriptomic and multiomic approaches, these studies
will determine whether hypoxia or non-hypoxic mechanisms drive Hif activation following recurrent injury, test
whether targeted inhibition/deletion of Hif1α/Hif2α or both can prevent and/or enhance resolution of lung
fibrosis, determine the mediators through which epithelial Hif2 promotes local fibroblast activation, and define
the interacting partners by which Hif2 regulates fate and function of regenerating AECs. Together, these
experiments will determine crucial insights into the “upstream” mechanisms linking dysfunctional alveolar repair
to lung fibrosis, and establish HIF2 as a novel therapeutic target to interrupt the PF pathobiology and promote
functional alveolar regeneration."

Despite high rates of need, REM youth are significantly more likely to prematurely dropout of mental health
services as compared to their White peers. This is due in part to poor therapeutic alliance and concerns about
treatment relevance and acceptability. Existing engagement interventions are limited, with few addressing
treatment retention for REM youth at risk for depression and suicide. Measurement-based care (MBC) is the
use of patient-reported progress data throughout mental health treatment to promote collaborative, patient-
centered treatment plan adjustments. MBC is an outstanding candidate to improve treatment engagement due
to its focus on personalized treatment and is also highly effective when integrated in depression treatment. Yet,
MBC could be tailored to better address the unique needs of REM youth. MBC has not been examined as a
treatment engagement strategy for REM youth with depressive symptoms or suicide risk. Further, no clinical
protocols, guidelines or training supports exist to facilitate clinician use of MBC with REM youth and their
caregivers. Based on past research, we have developed a theoretically-driven, culturally-tailored MBC
approach, Strategic Treatment Assessment for Youth (STAY). STAY targets therapeutic alliance and treatment
relevance and acceptability (concerns particularly relevant to REM youth and their caregivers) to improve
treatment retention, depression symptoms and suicide outcomes. Pilot data suggest STAY is acceptable,
feasible, and appropriate. In Aim 1, we will refine the preliminary STAY protocol and implementation plan to
support delivery in a wide variety of clinical contexts. A user centered design approach including cognitive
walkthroughs and lab-based testing with N=12 expert stakeholders will be used to rapidly refine prototype
versions for usability. In Aim 1, we will also develop STAY instrumentation for clinician fidelity, knowledge,
skills, and attitudes to be piloted in Aim 2. Aim 2 will involve a pilot effectiveness-implementation Hybrid Type 2
trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and initial effectiveness of STAY as compared to
an active control condition (MBC As Usual). Clinicians (N=20) at three community mental health clinics will be
randomly assigned to STAY or MBC As Usual and N=60 adolescent patient/caregiver dyads (Total N=120)
who meet inclusion criteria will also be recruited to participate. Initial effectiveness of STAY on treatment
engagement mechanisms (treatment alliance, relevance), service outcomes (treatment attendance,
engagement, completion) and youth outcomes (depression, suicidality) will be assessed. This pilot will inform
optimal study procedures, measures, and sites for a fully-powered Hybrid Type 2 trial. Disparities in depression
and suicide rates are a national public health crisis. This project offers an innovative, culturally-tailored
approach to retain REM youth in mental health services, reduce disparities and improve patient outcomes. This
study contributes to NIMH Strategic Goal 4.3 to improve the public health impact of mental health services
received by diverse communities by improving care quality for REM youth at risk for depression and/or suicide."

A decade of gene discovery identified over 250 genes highly associated to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). One
of the next critical steps to better understand ASD etiology is to determine how ASD risk genes converge on
cellular and network function. One central locus at which ASD risk genes converge are prefrontal cortex (PFC)
layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Layer 5 pyramidal neurons have specialized dendritic arbors thought to function as
coincidence detectors to effectively integrate both local and long-range synaptic inputs. Abnormal dendritic
processing is suggested to contribute to social, cognitive, and communication deficits typically observed in ASD.
Our lab has recently identified dendritic impairments in mice haploinsufficient for Scn2a, which has some of the
strongest associated scores to ASD. Here, I will test the central hypothesis that multiple ASD risk genes with
distinct biological functions converge on impairments in dendritic excitability and synaptic integration. This work
is expected to reveal whether dendritic excitability is indeed a point of convergence across high-risk ASD genes
and will uncover precisely which aspects of dendritic excitability are most affected in these cases. In addition,
most ASD risk genes are known or predicted to cause ASD due to haploinsufficiency. I will also test whether cis-
regulation gene therapy could be a viable therapeutic approach to restore ASD risk gene haploinsufficiency and
downstream deficits in dendritic and synaptic functions. Our results will have a positive impact as this work will
reveal mechanisms that contribute to altered dendritic excitability, which, in turn, may give us greater insight to
the pathophysiology of ASD and may provide a novel therapeutic approach to restore convergent features of
neuronal and network dysfunction."

CANDIDATE: I am a postdoctoral research associate in the laboratory of Dr. Yu Chen in the Human Oncology
and Pathogenesis Program (HOPP) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. My PhD training at Boston
University School of Medicine under the supervision of Dr. Sam Thiagalingam allowed me to develop cellular
and molecular biological skills to functionally characterize candidate genes involved in cancer progression and
investigate therapeutic vulnerabilities. My current research focuses on utilizing patient-derived organoid models
to define epigenetic subtypes of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and determining the dependency
on transcription factors to mediate growth and lineage identity. My proposed research and mentoring plan will
provide me with a strong foundation towards becoming an independent investigator in academia. My long-term
career goal is to advance personalized cancer medicine, with specific interests in disease modeling, functional
characterization of drivers of lineage plasticity, and evaluation of therapeutics to target oncogenic dependency.
To achieve this goal, I have developed a career plan that will ensure my success to becoming an independent
investigator by: 1) bolstering my scientific knowledge and technical expertise, 2) assembling an advisory
committee to oversee my training progress, 3) improving my communication skills, 4) expanding my
professional network, and 4) preparing me for leading and mentoring future trainees.
RESEARCH: Prostate cancer depends on androgen receptor (AR) signaling for growth and survival. The
advent of therapies targeting AR signaling has driven the disease towards AR-independence. Using a
functional genomics approach, we have identified a new epigenetic subtype of CRPC called stem cell-like
(SCL), which is driven by FOSL1 and lacks therapeutic options. Genetic perturbation of FOSL1 and its
cooperating factors YAP/TAZ leads to impaired cell growth and loss of SCL lineage, suggesting that CRPC-
SCL cells are dependent on FOSL1 for survival. Building on these discoveries, in this proposal, I aim to: 1)
Define the role of FOSL1 in mediating lineage plasticity and resistance to enzalutamide in prostate cancer and
2) Evaluate therapeutics to target the YAP/TAZ/TEAD/FOSL1 pathway in the stem cell-like subtype of prostate
cancer.
ENVIRONMENT: The Yu Chen laboratory is a part of the HOPP under the leadership of Dr. Charles Sawyers
at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, a top-tier institute in cancer research. The primary mentor is Dr.
Yu Chen, a pioneer in developing prostate cancer organoids from patients and an expert in the study of
epigenetics and aberrantly activated transcriptional programs. Furthermore, my advisory committee and
collaborator will provide additional support for the proposed research and career development plans."

This F32 fellowship award aims to facilitate the training and career transition of Dr. Filipe Fernandes Stoyell-
Conti, Ph.D., an outstanding minority candidate, in vascular biology and atherosclerosis. Specifically, the grant
offers to Dr. Fernandes Stoyell-Conti the possibility of improving his hands-on skills in the laboratory,
strengthening his critical thinking and advancing his knowledge in bioinformatics and vascular biology. He will
receive training while investigating the role of lysyl oxidase (LOX), a copper-dependent amine oxidase, in smooth
muscle cells (SMCs) biology and atherosclerosis. Dr. Fernandes Stoyell-Conti research hypothesis is that LOX
facilitates SMC cell migration, inflammation, and foam cell formation during atherogenesis. In three specific aims,
he will: 1) investigate whether inactivation of LOX in SMCs compromises in vivo phenotypic switch of SMC, 2)
demonstrate that expression of LOX in SMC increases atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic mice, and 3) examine
the molecular mechanisms by which LOX changes gene expression in SMCs. He will combine state of the art
animal models, transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and molecular biology to demonstrate that LOX can “turn off/on” gene
transcription in SMCs to make them more atherogenic. Together, these studies will advance his knowledge about
LOX's role in atherosclerosis and facilitate his transition towards independence as principal investigator in the
field of vascular biology and cardiovascular disease."
10808497,"Project Summary:
DNA double strand breaks (DSB) pose harmful threats to genomic integrity. For this reason, cells evolved a
diverse set of tightly regulated pathways dedicated to repairing these lesions. In human cells, two major pathways
are responsible for repairing most DSBs, including Homologous Recombination (HR) and Non-Homologous End
Joining (NHEJ). Mediator of DNA Damage Checkpoint 1 (MDC1) is a key DSBR protein that facilitates HR and
NHEJ by binding to γH2AX at DSB sites and promoting RNF8- and RNF168-dependent ubiquitination of H2A at
K13 and K15. Considering that MDC1’s functions in HR do not require BRCA1 and its deletion only mildly
increases cellular sensitivity to DSBs, the exact mechanism by which MDC1 promotes HR has remained unclear.
Using live-cell single-molecule (LCSM) imaging, we recently found that MDC1 is constitutively tethered to
chromatin by its intrinsically disordered PST repeat domain, which has unknown functions in DSBR. Compelling
preliminary data suggests this domain is essential for MDC1-dependent HR and is dispensable for MDC1-
dependent NHEJ. Interestingly, LCSM imaging studies reveal the PST domain may spatially restrict MDC1-
dependent HR by directly tethering MDC1 to transcriptionally active chromatin. In addition, our data demonstrate
the PST-chromatin interaction can be negatively regulated by phosphorylation, which may link phospho-
dependent changes in the PST-chromatin interaction with MDC1’s distinct functions in HR and NHEJ. Therefore,
I hypothesize that MDC1-dependent HR is a specialized pathway dedicated to resolving transcription-associated
DSBs that depends upon a regulatable interaction of MDC1’s PST domain with chromatin. To test this
hypothesis, I will integrate a variety of molecular, biochemical and biophysical approaches with training in ChIP-
seq and genome-wide CRISPR screening during the K99 phase of this award to: 1. Identify the molecular
mechanism underlying MDC1’s PST-dependent association with chromatin (Aim 1); 2. Elucidate a functional role
for MDC1 and its PST domain in transcription-coupled HR (Aim 2); and 3. Define the molecular mechanism of
the MDC1-dependent HR pathway (Aim 3). Not only will the Aim 1 and 2 studies uncover the molecular
mechanism of MDC1’s PST domain in DSBR, but they will also lead to the identification of MDC1 mutants with
pathway-specific DSBR functions. Therefore, in Aim 3 I will use these pathway-specific MDC1 alleles and
genome-wide CRISPR screens to genetically define the MDC1-dependent HR pathway. These studies will
significantly advance our understanding of the fundamental processes by which cells maintain their genomic
integrity by revealing the mechanistic basis for MDC1’s functions in homologous recombination. In addition to
the mentored scientific and professional development opportunities provided during the K99 phase, results from
the proposed studies will be used as preliminary data for R-series grants to be submitted during the R00 phase
of this award."

Use of telemedicine to deliver specialty care to adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has increased rapidly in the
last 3 years and persists as a means to enhance access to care for many patients who face barriers to in-
person care, such as those in rural areas, or with limited mobility or transportation. However, evidence
suggests that telemedicine is less effective than in-person care for patients with complex T2D, including those
who use multiple daily injections of insulin and have multiple comorbid conditions. Endocrinologists report that
components of high-quality care, including diabetes self-management education and home blood glucose data
sharing, are more difficult to deliver via telemedicine. Barriers to delivery of high-quality care can have greater
impact on adults with complex T2D, whose disease is already more difficult to manage and who are at higher
risk of diabetes-related complications and mortality. Therefore, current gaps in diabetes care quality between
in-person and telemedicine care for adults with complex T2D must be characterized and addressed in order
for expanded access to care via telemedicine to translate into improved diabetes outcomes for all patients,
especially those at highest risk. This K23 award will support the health services research career development
of endocrinologist Margaret Zupa, MD MS. Dr. Zupa will use data from a large integrated health system to
inform design of a pragmatic intervention to deliver high-quality care to adults with complex T2D via
telemedicine through the following specific aims: Aim 1) Characterize gaps in delivery of high-quality care
elements via telemedicine for adults with complex T2D. Aim 2) Leverage patient and provider perspectives to
develop an intervention to deliver high-quality diabetes telemedicine care for adults with complex T2D. Aim 3)
Determine feasibility and preliminary outcomes of a pragmatic intervention to provide high-quality diabetes
telemedicine care for adults with complex T2D. With the knowledge gained in these aims, Dr. Zupa will
develop an approach to improve care quality and clinical outcomes for adults with T2D who are at high risk of
adverse diabetes outcomes and rely on telemedicine to access care.
Dr. Zupa has developed a thorough training and mentoring plan which aligns with the above research. She will
build skills in advanced quantitative modeling of care pathways and outcomes, pragmatic clinical trial design,
and application of implementation science mixed methods to healthcare delivery. An experienced,
multidisciplinary team of mentors with a strong track record of impactful diabetes and virtual care research is
committed to supporting Dr. Zupa in achieving these career development and research goals and in
progressing to independence as a health services researcher. This mentored research and training will lead to
the development of a future hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized trial to evaluate the impact of this
intervention on clinical, patient-centered, and quality outcomes."

 For many years it was thought that “immunologic memory” cannot be induced within the innate immune
system. However, recent research challenges this long held dogma. There is now compelling evidence that the
innate immune system can be “trained” to respond more rapidly and effectively to pathogens. These findings
challenge the existing paradigm that innate immunity cannot develop “memory” or be “trained” to respond more
effectively to infection and indicate that “trained immunity” can be harnessed to increase resistance to infection.
Trained immunity elicits broad resistance to infection that persists for weeks to months and is not specific with
respect to the causative agent. The development of immune training drugs would make it possible to harness the
potential of trained immunity for the treatment of disease. β-Glucan, a fungal cell wall constituent, confers
resistance to infection with Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as viral and fungal pathogens.
Numerous studies have shown that β-glucans will induce innate immune training. In fact, β-glucans are now
recognized as the “gold standard” for induction of the immune trained phenotype. However, β-glucan is a natural
product that is isolated from fungal sources. Large scale isolation of natural product β-glucans is plagued by
QA/QC problems and reproducibility issues. This is due in large part to the fact that all natural product β-glucans
are a distribution of glucan polymers with varying polymer lengths and, in some cases, differences in branching
frequency, length of side chain branches and solution conformation. What was needed were methods for the
complete chemical synthesis of (1→3,1→6)-β-glucans with specific structural characteristics including polymer
size, side chain branching frequency, side chain branch length, etc. We have successfully developed convergent
synthetic approaches for the de novo synthesis of (1→3,1→6)-β-glucans with specific structural characteristics.
The goals of this research are to: i) evaluate the ability of synthetic glucan glycomimetics to induce the immune
trained phenotype and ii) to compare and contrast the bioactivity of different glucan glycomimetic formulations to
natural product glucans. We hypothesize that synthetic glucan glycomimetics will induce the trained immune
phenotype similar to natural product glucans. To critically evaluate this hypothesis we propose the following
specific aims. Aim 1. Assess the ability of glucan glycomimetics to induce the immune trained phenotype. Aim 2.
Examine the immune training ability of glucan glycomimetics conjugated to silica nanoparticles. A successful
conclusion to this research will result in the identification of synthetic (1→3,1→6)-β-glucan glycomimetics that will
induce the immune trained phenotype in human immunocytes. This will lead to the development of glycomimetic
drug candidates that can prophylactically and/or therapeutically induce immune training and alter the course of
disease. In addition, a successful conclusion to this research will result in new and novel data on the structure
activity relationships of glucans in trained immunity."

Chagas disease (CD) remains one of the most neglected illnesses in the world, with estimates indicating 5.7
million infected people in Latin and Central America. Currently, there are many barriers that patients with CD
have to overcome to obtain a diagnosis, adequate treatment, and appropriate follow-up. One of the main ones is
the high rate of underdiagnosis and consequently of patients treated. It is estimated that less than 10% of patients
are diagnosed and that less than 1% are treated. Furthermore, to date, there is no ""reliable"" method that allows
measuring therapeutic efficacy. During the last 15 years, researchers from the São Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical
Medicine Research Center (SaMi-Trop) have developed numerous projects that have evidenced the high number
of patients in an endemic area in the north of the State of Minas Gerais, in addition to providing valuable
information on the natural history of CD, the rate of progression to cardiomyopathy and its relationship with
antibody levels. A great key to the success of such initiatives has been their strategic articulation with primary
health care, which has made it possible to have large cohorts of patients accompanied for more than 10 years.
Therefore, it is intended in this project to apply all this knowledge and articulation to identify methodologies and
tools that allow overcoming existing barriers. The results obtained will make it possible to increase the number
of diagnosed patients to whom treatment will be offered and identify strategies and biomarkers that make it
possible to improve patient follow-up and help evaluate new treatment candidates."

Tobacco smoking is a serious public health concern and is 2 to 3 times more prevalent among HIV-infected
individuals than the general population. Smoking reduces the efficacy of combination antiretroviral therapy and
substantially impacts the long-term survival of HIV-infected individuals. Several studies have suggested that
chronic tobacco (cigarette) smoking and HIV infection have harmful additive or synergistic effects on the brain,
leading to greater psychopathology, impulsivity and cognitive dysfunction. Little is known about the
neurochemical profile related to the combined effects of HIV infection and smoking. HERCULES is a novel J-
difference-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technique that can measure up to seven low-
concentration brain metabolites (e.g., GABA) with relatively short scan times. However, HERCULES is sensitive
to subject motion, which affects both localization accuracy and spectral quality. Both HIV-infected subjects and
tobacco smokers have greater impulsivity that might lead to greater subject motion. Therefore, the aims of this
project are: 1) K99 phase: the candidate will be mentored in the development of the motion-corrected
HERCULES sequence, which will allow robust investigation of these neurometabolites; he will also assess the
reproducibility of HERCULES with and without motion correction in seronegative (SN) healthy controls; 2) K99
phase: to learn to conduct a pilot clinical study using the optimized motion-corrected HERCULES to evaluate the
neurometabolic profile of HIV-infected individuals or tobacco smokers, compared to SN healthy controls; 3) R00
phase: to measure a comprehensive neurochemical profile in four groups of individuals (SN/tobacco-,
HIV+/tobacco-, SN/tobacco+, HIV+/tobacco+), using the motion-corrected HERCULES sequence. Based on the
proposed clinical training and didactic courses, the candidate will work with experienced globally recognized
experts in the fields of MRS and clinical HIV research to achieve five training goals: (1) develop expertise in
research design and clinical assessments of HIV-infected individuals and tobacco smokers; (2) conduct a pilot
study to evaluate the independent effects of HIV and tobacco smoking on neurometabolite levels; (3) learn to
apply an advanced MRS technique to clinical research, especially in HIV+ individuals and tobacco smokers; and
(4) learn to apply advanced statistical methods to analyze complex clinical data from patient populations. The
long-term career objective of the candidate is to become an independent scientist with a complete repertoire of
skills in MRS methodologies and their clinical applications. The motion-corrected HERCULES can be applied to
study metabolic processes in other diseases as well, adding scope and impact to this research proposal, which
is also responsive to NIDA’s mission of “strategically supporting and conducting basic and clinical research on
drug use (including nicotine), its consequences, and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms involved.”"

The diagnosis of rare diseases has seen enormous gains from the advent of whole-exome and whole-genome
sequencing as clinical diagnostic tools. However, due to the large number of rare variants of unknown
significance found in poorly characterized genes, there is a significant need for functional annotation of genes
and variants. Model organism research has proven to be one of the most cost-effective methods to annotate
genes and understand the biology underlying gene function and disease. This project will develop a resource
of rigorously validated, translatable zebrafish models of previously undiagnosed human genetic diseases.
Clinical and genetic information about new cases of undiagnosed rare human diseases will be obtained
through collaboration with the clinical sites of the Diagnostic Centers of Excellence (DCoEs) and the Genomics
Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare diseases (GREGoR) Consortium. A bioinformatics pipeline will be
used to analyze and prioritize variants obtained from the patients for further study. Then humanized zebrafish
genetic models of the selected gene variants will be generated using a new CRISPR/cas9 homologous
recombination technology. The models will be validated by sequencing and phenotypic characterizations
including molecular phenotypes. The resource of humanized animal models will be made available to the
research community through the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC), and the accompanying
genetic and phenotypic metadata will be deposited at the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN) and the
Alliance of Genome Resources."
10799685,"Functional changes in both adaptive and innate immunity contribute to immunosenescence during aging. The
immune system has also been implicated in inflammation, autoimmunity and reduced protein aggregate
clearance in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aging immune cells harbor wide-ranging
impairment of autophagy pathways, including macroautophagy (MA) and chaperone-mediated autophagy
(CMA), which trigger functional alterations in key immune cell subsets, such as T cells and monocyte-derived
macrophages. Mechanisms responsible for the aging-associated decrease in autophagic activity and a
comprehensive characterization of their functional consequences has remained elusive, but may hold the key
for the development of innovative new therapies to counteract aging-associated neurodegenerative processes
and pathologies, including AD and AD related dementias.
 In previous periods of this PP, we have identified new and specific functions of autophagy in the immune system
and have characterized aging-associated dysregulation of MA and CMA in immune cells. This acquired
knowledge, established tools and gained expertise allows us to now work towards a better understanding of new
important concepts in the context of Geroscience – specifically, to define how an altered interplay between two
organ systems, the immune system and the central nervous system, facilitates propagation of dysregulated
autophagy-mediated proteostasis networks and leads to age-associated pathologies.
In this project, we will investigate the functional consequences of an aging hematopoietic and peripheral immune
system with impaired proteostasis in AD, as well as characterize the reciprocal effects of AD on immune cell
generation and function. We will determine the consequences of altered proteostasis in T cells in the
development and progress of Alzheimer’s disease (Aim1), characterize the role of age-associated autophagy-
defective innate immune cells originating from commonly occurring acquired clonal hematopoiesis in
neurodegeneration and AD during aging (Aim2) and elucidate how AD-associated proteotoxicity contributes to
the dysregulation of function and proteostasis in the bone marrow and peripheral immune cells (Aim3),
Integration in the PP: This project will utilize novel CMA reporter mice, develop new mouse models with
modulated autophagy in T cells to assess the consequences of improve proteostasis in T cells for AD pathology,
and establish and test novel AD mouse models harboring autophagy-impaired innate immune cells originating
form age-associated clonal hematopoiesis. We will also use the three experimental mouse models of AD. All
mice will be maintained by the Animal Core and shared by all the projects. Importantly, we will utilize chemical
modulators of CMA developed by Therapeutics Core to evaluate their ability to restore immune function and
inhibit or slow progress of neurodegeneration and AD pathology. Image-based analysis of the changes in
peripheral and central autophagy and assessment of in vivo immune cell function will be done with state-of-the-
art image technology provided by the Image Core. Mechanisms of intercommunication between peripheral and
central autophagy will be investigated in conjunction with P1 and P4, and the ability of brain-draining lymph
carried products to influence immune cell function will be studied together with P2. The Biostatistics Unit will
assist with analysis of data and integration of results from all four projects.
Relevance to public health: Our study will identify mechanisms triggering altered hematopoiesis and peripheral
immune function in the elderly and provide novel fundamental insights into the systemic relationships of tissue
degeneration during aging. Moreover, the data collected herein are very likely to provide strong preclinical
rationales for developing novel therapeutic interventions for age-associated pathologies by restoring autophagy."
10784929,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Innovative medical technologies can improve health and increase longevity for older adults with chronic
disease and multimorbidity, yet new data are needed to promote their adoption and effective use in real-world
settings. For example, nearly a quarter of all adults ≥65 years old in the US have diabetes. Technology-based
approaches to diabetes management, such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), can improve clinical
outcomes and quality of life in this age group, in addition to preventing dangerous episodes of hypoglycemia.
Despite the potential benefits, CGM remains underutilized among older adults compared to younger adults. My
career objective is to generate the scientific evidence needed to expand and improve the delivery of
guidelines-aligned care for the expanding population of older adults with diabetes, and particularly with respect
to rapidly emerging technology such as CGM. To this end, analyzing healthcare data (e.g., medical record
data, insurance claims) can directly complement the existing evidence, and particularly randomized clinical trial
(RCT) data, by revealing how therapies work in routine care, over longer durations of time, and in populations
that are typically underrepresented in those RCTs (e.g., those ≥65 years and subgroups with multimorbidity,
frailty, and cognitive impairment). Economic evaluation can further elucidate the broader implications of scaling
uptake and sustained use of evidence-based, technologic therapies in older adult populations. My goal for
this K01 award is thus to acquire rigorous training under interdisciplinary mentorship to develop (1) an
understanding of the strengths and limitations of healthcare data sources and linkage solutions, (2) the
capacity to apply advanced causal methods to analyze linked healthcare data, and (3) experience with
economic evaluation. My proposal has exciting, high-impact training opportunities to address three
fundamental gaps in the literature, including sparse research characterizing (1) patterns of CGM use among
older adults and (2) the clinical effects of long-term use in such real-world settings, as well as a dearth of data
on the (3) economic impacts of scaling CGM in this age group. I will (1) use a linked, real-world healthcare
database to characterize subgroups of older adults with insulin-requiring diabetes who do and do not use
CGM; (2) model the clinical effects of long-term CGM use on outcomes that are relevant for both endocrinology
and geriatric medicine, and across key subgroups (e.g., ≥80 years, with cognitive impairment, multimorbidity,
and recurrent hypoglycemia); and (3) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of scaling CGM use in this population.
Completion of my aims will generate new evidence for CGM use in older adults that is relevant to patients,
providers, and payers— a critical step to increase widespread uptake. By the end of the award, I will be
positioned as a future leader in aging research with expertise to evaluate the real-world clinical and economic
impacts of evidence-based technologies for older adults. I will use these skills to bridge innovations in diabetes
care with the population of geriatric patients who stand to benefit most yet remain underrepresented in RCTs."

The function of Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) has been studied in detail at the genetic and phenotypic level,
but how posttranslational modifications, specifically ubiquitination, affect their activity constitutes a gap in
knowledge.
There is therefore a critical need to better understand the function of HSC ubiquitin ligases
, which
represent attractive targets for drug discovery. The ubiquitin ligase-associated protein DCAF7 (DDB1 And CUL4
Associated Factor 7) is highly expressed in HSCs, and mutations in the gene are found in myeloid disorders.
Studying DCAF7 function in hematopoiesis is relevant to understanding how ubiquitination controls HSC function
and how its dysregulation contributes to bone marrow failure and malignancies. My preliminary data show that
deletion of Dcaf7 in mouse embryos results in a significantly lower number of mice born, and that loss of Dcaf7
in adult mice impairs HSC self-renewal and differentiation. Thus, my hypothesis is that DCAF7 is an essential
regulator of hematopoiesis by modulating proteostasis and expression of differentiation genes. My proposed
studies will investigate the role of DCAF7 in hematopoiesis through two specific aims: 1) Determine how DCAF7
loss affects HSC function in fetal and adult environments and 2) Investigate the molecular mechanisms by which
DCAF7 regulates HSC function. Ultimately, my studies will provide fundamental insights into the physiologic

will be completed at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital under the guidance of Dr. Crispino and an advisory

 Previous studies show that there is a need to build capacity for mentored Responsible Conduct of
Research (RCR), research/scientific integrity (RSI), Conflict of Interest (CoI), Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
(DEI), Safe Working Environment and Sexual Harassment training in Nigeria. Therefore, collaborators from the
University of Maryland School of Medicine, Center for Bioethics and Research, and the University of Ibadan,
Nigeria who have an established record of building bioethics capacity in Nigeria collaborated to develop a locally
contextual training program which is linked with local experiences, examples, resources and mentors to be
relevant and applicable to researchers' experiences.
 In this new application, we engage our successful training resources, technologies, and models to build
institutional resources and infrastructure for RCR, RSI, CoI, DEI, Safe Working Environment and Sexual
Harassment in sixteen Nigerian universities. We advocate, build public and professional awareness, implement
training and innovative e-mentoring on RCR and RSI training, Safe Working Environment (SWE) and Sexual
Harassment for researchers in Nigeria. We work with our trainees to build repository of case studies, case
scenarios, and examples of RCR, RSI, CoI, DEI, Safe Working Environment and Sexual Harassment from the
local environment and incorporate these in our training programs. We evaluate the experiences and expectations
of our trainees and use these to create a Learning Educational Program (LEP) with regular adjustments and
updates to our curriculum contents and training examples."

Autoimmune disease is the third most common disease category after cancer and heart disease that afflicts
23.5 million Americans. This grant renewal continues to focus on the role of neutrophil FcγRs in autoimmune
diseases. However, it has shifted from understanding the role and regulation of neutrophil FcγRs in neutrophil
recruitment following intravascular IgG-immune complex deposition in glomerulonephritis (GN) to examining
how engaging FcγRs converts neutrophils into highly immunogenic antigen presenting cells (nAPC) and their
contribution to autoimmune disorders effecting the kidney. This new direction is based on our recent studies
showing that engaging mouse FcγRs or human FcγRIIA or IIIB on mature neutrophils with IgG-complexed
antigen (immune complexes) leads to their differentiation into highly active APCs. These cells are
comparable to cDCs in their ability to activate naïve T cells and cross-present soluble antigen to CD8 T cells,
properties previously assigned almost exclusively to cDCs. Engaging FcγR with an anti-FcγRIIIB-antigen
conjugate recapitulates the activity of immune complexes and its administration in FcγR humanized mice
generates nAPCs in vivo that elicit robust acquired immunity. Studies in lupus patient samples indicate that
nAPC frequency in blood correlates with clinical disease scores, which suggests that nAPCs are pathogenic.
Single cell transcriptional analyses and validation studies implicate the pioneer transcription factor PU.1 in
neutrophil to nAPC conversion and suggest that transcriptionally defined neutrophil populations convert to
two nAPC subsets with distinct gene signatures and functionality. Furthermore, we provide evidence that
FcγR internalization and a defined epigenetic regulator play a key role in conversion. Here we propose to 1)
Elucidate the functionality of nAPC subsets and the role of epigenetic regulation in neutrophil to nAPC
conversion, 2) Elucidate the route of intracellular trafficking of FcγR bound to antibody-antigen complexes
and identify mechanisms of FcγR induced generation of immunogenic nAPCs using CRISPR-Cas9 based
genetic screens, and 3) Interrogate the role of nAPCs in Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-
associated glomerulonephritis and the effect of antigen-tolerized nAPCs in disease outcomes. Dysregulation
of the immune system is the basis of many autoimmune diseases for which current treatments are effective
in only a subset of patients and are often neither curative nor durable. Neutrophils with APC markers have
been observed in diseases from autoimmune diseases to cancer. Results from this proposal may provide
important insights into the molecular and cellular pathways governing neutrophil conversion to immunogenic
APCs. This could provide insights into the pathogenesis of many immune related disorders and lay the
groundwork for new treatments that potentially non-invasively generate a large pool of antigen carrying APCs
designed to elicit tolerance or acquired immunity."

Heightened sensitivity to stress can lead to maladaptive coping behaviors, such as social withdrawal and
aggression. Children that experience early-life adversity (ELA) have an increased risk of developing similar
difficulties, particularly after experiencing subsequent stressful events in later life. Parental care, and paternal
care in particular, can have protective effects on the development of social behavior and well-being. Yet, the
impact of paternal care and the neuroendocrine factors that are involved in responsiveness to later life stress in
offspring are vastly understudied, and an animal model for mammalian biparental care and stress
responsiveness is greatly needed. Further, oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (VP) are essential neuropeptides that
modulate social behaviors but epigenetic modifications of their receptor genes in response to ELA have not been
well characterized. I will develop a two-hit model of ELA and adolescent stress by using the bi-parental prairie
vole (Microtus ochrogaster) to assess how paternal deprivation during a specific pre-weaning sensitive window
biases sensitivity to adolescent chronic social defeat stress through OT- and VP-related changes in the lateral
septum and neural activity therein. The effects of paternal deprivation from birth in prairie vole offspring have
been reported to induce deficits in pair bonding, and region-specific and sex-specific modifications in OT and VP
receptor expression. Yet there is a research gap in examining the consequences of disrupting direct paternal
care or breaking father-offspring bonds, the interaction of paternal deprivation with chronic social defeat stress,
and its collective impact on genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic mechanisms the mediate offspring social behavior
and brain development. This project will integrate multiple levels of analysis (behavioral, epigenetic, cell-specific
gene and protein profiling, and neuronal function) to understand the mechanisms in the lateral septum through
which paternal deprivation can mitigate reactivity to stressors in adolescence."
10801003,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One of the major causes of sino-pulmonary disease is primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), also called immotile cilia
syndrome. PCD is an inherited disease affecting 1 in ~20,000 individuals. More than 50 genetic variants have
been identified that are associated with immotile, dyskinetic, or aplastic cilia, and produce a similar clinical
syndrome of chronic sinusitis, bronchitis and bronchiectasis, recurrent pneumonia, infertility, and often situs
inversus (Kartagener syndrome). Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) derived from the epithelial NO synthases (NOSs) is
low in PCD patients and serves as a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for the disease. Cystic fibrosis (CF)
and acute viral infections can also lower exhaled NO levels, but the mechanism that underlies the low NO and
how this might contribute to the disease remains unknown. In our preliminary data, using knock-down
methodologies in zebrafish and mice, we report on a novel and unexpected finding: we have identified cytoglobin
as a conserved protein that is essential for developmental stage-specific NO signaling and ciliary motility,
required for the establishment of left-right patterning in the developing embryo and normal airway ciliary motility.
In this proposal we hypothesize that airway epithelial cytoglobin co-localizes with cilia and NOS as a metabolon
to regulate NOS-NO signaling and ciliary assembly and function. We further propose that cytoglobin modulation
of NOS-NO influences organ laterality development, potentially explaining the link between airway
inflammation/oxidative stress, NO production and signaling, ciliary function in PCD, and organ laterality
determination, with relevance to acute viral infection, smoking, and CF. Finally, we propose to exploit this new
discovery therapeutically, by testing drugs that activate the NOS-NO-soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) pathway
to correct ciliary function in our zebrafish, mouse, and human airway epithelial models.
Aim 1 will explore the mechanisms of cytoglobin-dependent regulation of zebrafish, mouse, and human
NOS and cilia function. We have developed multiple mouse models, including CYGB knock-out, gain-of-
function (H81Q), and loss-of-function (K116E) mutations that affect heme ligand binding and oxidation-reduction,
and will evaluate interactions with NOS isoforms in zebrafish and mice and in human airway epithelial cell lines
from patients with PCD.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that therapeutic activation of the CYGB-NOS-NO-sGC signaling pathway
can restore airway epithelial ciliary function and developmental abnormalities in zebrafish, mouse, and
human models. Translational evaluation of genomic gain and loss of function and drug treatments will be
performed in human PCD airway epithelial cell cultures to identify new therapeutic approaches to improve muco-
ciliary clearance in airway disease."

The goal of this proposal is to investigate the dynamic changes in cerebrovascular morphology after acute
ischemic stroke and reperfusion therapy and also use cerebrovascular morphological features to improve stroke
outcome predictions. Stroke is among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Acute Ischemic
stroke (AIS) constitutes approximately 90% of all strokes and is caused by a blockage or significant narrowing
of the brain vessels. The resultant disruption in the blood flow patterns downstream of the occlusion could place
the under-perfused regions of the brain at risk. Acute reperfusion therapies can restore the blood flow but vessel
recanalization and improve outcomes when performed early after AIS. A well-connected collateral supply
system, a redundant network of bypass vessels existing in the brain, is correlated with smaller final infarct size
and more favorable outcomes. However, a detailed evaluation of the collateral supply remains challenging due
to the small vessel size and network complexity. Timely diagnosis and treatment of AIS, as well as an accurate
prediction of response to reperfusion therapies, risk of major complications, and long-term outcomes, are pivotal
to patients, families, and providers to guide treatment pathways. However, accurate predictive models are
lacking despite efforts to use a large number of clinical and imaging biomarkers. Brain vascular morphology and
geometrical features have been shown to correlate with the development of cerebrovascular disorders. We
recently developed an automatic algorithm that can extract the brain’s vascular morphologic and geometric
features from the commonly used MR and CT angiograms in healthy subjects and AIS patients. We propose
developing further and validating this algorithm to automatically extract complex cerebrovascular morphology in
real-time. We also propose developing predictor models to accurately use the cerebrovascular morphologic
features, collateral index, and other clinical and imaging information collected at admission to predict major
complications and long-term outcomes after AIS."
10805486,"Summary
Aortic aneurysms and dissections are the most serious and deadly manifestations of Marfan Syndrome (MFS),
and current therapies to prevent aortic dilation are only moderately effective. MFS is caused by mutations or
deletions in fibrillin-1 (Fbn1), a component of extracellular microfibrils, which surround and connect elastic fibers
to smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the aortic media. Reduced fibrillin function alters signaling between
extracellular matrix and SMCs, resulting in SMC apopotosis and extracellular matrix degradation. In addition, the
altered signaling leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO),
increasing oxidative and nitrosative stress and activating protein kinase G (PKG) via the NO/cGMP pathway.
Although the increased ROS, reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and PKG activation contribute to aneurysm
formation in MFS, neither the sources of ROS/RNS nor the effects of oxidative/nitrosative stress on SMC
functions are fully understood. The vitamin B12 analog cobinamide, on which we hold several patents, is a strong
and versatile antioxidant that can neutralize ROS and RNS, including NO. During the last grant period, we
showed that mice with an activating PKG1 mutation (Prkg1R177Q) that causes thoracic aneurysms and dissections
in humans, develop aortic dilation associated with increased oxidative stress and media degeneration⸺elastic
fiber fragmentation, increased matrix metalloproteinase activity, media fibrosis, and SMC apoptosis; cobinamide
treatment completely prevented these changes. Preliminary data show that cobinamide also reduces aortic
dilation and prevents elastic fiber fragmentation and SMC apoptosis in a mouse model of MFS (Fbn1C1041G/+),
while reducing markers of oxidative stress and excess PKG signaling. We hypothesize that increased ROS/RNS
combined with PKG activation from increased NO synthase (NOS2) drive abnormal SMC functions and aortic
pathology in MFS, and that an optimized dose schedule of cobinamide will prevent aortic dilation and improve
survival in mice with MFS, especially when combined with a -blocker. In Aim 1, we will determine the mecha-
nisms and consequences of excess ROS/RNS generation in human fibrillin1-deficient or mutant (iPSC-derived)
SMCs, using shRNA knockdown and pharmacological approaches to inhibit ROS/RNS-generating enzymes and
PKG in vitro. We will assess contributions of excess NO synthase and PKG activity to the progression of aortic
disease in vivo, by inducing SMC-specific knockout of NOS2 or PKG1 in Fbn1C1041G/+ mice. We will also test
whether ROS detoxification by SMC-specific catalase overexpression ameliorates aortic pathology. In Aim2, we
will determine the optimal cobinamide dose and starting time to prevent aortic dilation and death from aortic
dissections in mice with moderate (Fbn1C1041G/+) and severe (Fbn1mgR/mgR) MFS, respectively. In addition, we will
combine cobinamide with the β-blocker propranolol, because cobinamide prevents aortic media degeneration,
while propranolol reduces mechanical stress without affecting degenerative changes in the media. These studies
could lead to considerably improved treatment of the aortic disease in patients with MFS."

 Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer among American women and is projected to
become the most common cancer globally in 2021. To minimize the morbidity and mortality of
this disease, it is imperative to develop improved testing methods to enable more effective
treatment.
 The proposed work is to develop a new Single Photon Emission Breast Tomography (SPEBT)
scanner to carry out radionuclide tracer based molecular breast imaging which has demonstrated
clear advantages in the early detection of cancer malignancy in clinical trials, because of its 1)
capability to detect pathological functional changes which take place before morphological
anatomical developments and 2) up-to pico-mole sensitivity, which stems from collecting signals
directly at the molecular level.
 The SPEBT system will have a system detection efficiency of 3.5×10-2 and spatial resolution
of 2-mm, which are 50 and 2 times better than that of state-of-the-art dedicated single photon
emission molecular breast imaging cameras, respectively. The significant imaging performance
improvement will ease existing concerns on radiation dose and the inability to detect tumors of
less than 5-mm in size — issues that have prevented molecular breast imaging from playing a
much more prominent role in clinical breast cancer diagnosis and screening.
 The enabling concept behind the high-performance of the SPEBT is a novel detector
architecture, a three-dimensional sparse position-sensitive detector, that achieves collimation
largely by and for itself, which is termed self-collimation. This architecture allows the SPEBT to
achieve both high-resolution and high detection efficiency. This is a critical conceptual breakaway
from the mechanical-collimator-based detector structure that single-photon emission imaging
technology relies on for years — mechanical collimator mandates an inverse interdependency
between the resolution and detection efficiency, therefore, sets a hard ceiling for overall imaging
performance. The proposed approach opens up a broad path to better imaging performance for
breast and other imaging applications.
 The proposed project is to design and evaluate a SPEBT system with optimized configurations
and develop and test a proof-of-concept SPEBT prototype."

 Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the most prevalent neurological complication of
oral or intravenous chemotherapy. Approximately 50–90% of patients under chemotherapy are affected by CIPN
and bear a high risk of chronicity (approx. 30–40%). Limited symptomatic relief is provided by opioid analgesics,
antidepressants, or anticonvulsants. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of CIPN is still largely unknown. Several
different classes of anticancer drugs acting through different antineoplastic mechanisms can induce CIPN.
However, sensory impairment is always either the only or predominant adverse effect, suggesting the existence
of a common mechanism of pathogenesis.
 Tubulin is the building block of microtubules and a well-established target for multiple anticancer drugs
that can promote CIPN. The contribution of tubulin changes to the onset of CIPN is not well understood but is
strongly implicated as the determining factor. Tubulin and microtubules play crucial roles in sensory neuronal
functions including the distribution of cargos to distal regions of the nerve, TRP channel activity and regulation
of mitochondrial dynamics.
 The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that CIPN-promoting drugs may share an underlying
mechanism of pathogenesis based on modulation of tubulin post-translational modifications at a prodromal stage
of the disease. We will further evaluate whether accumulation of delta-2 tubulin, an irreversible modification of
a-tubulin, which we recently found to mediate axonal degeneration by the anti-cancer drug bortezomib, plays a
common pathogenic role in the neuropathic damage inflicted by unrelated CIPN-promoting drugs. Finally, we
will examine the contribution of mitochondrial and TRP channel dysfunction in the axonopathy induced by
accumulation of D2 in DRG neurons.
 Our proposal is based on our published data and the development of robust cellular and preclinical
models of CIPN generated by an ongoing collaboration between the PI and Dr. Yalda Moayedi, a co-investigator
on this application. Collectively, our studies will provide mechanistic insights into a unifying model of
pathogenesis for the development of CIPN based on tubulin modifications and will directly examine the
unexplored potential for tubulin-modifying enzymes in drug therapies aimed at preventing axonal injury and
neuropathic pain in CIPN. They will also pave the way to analyze the pathogenic role of modified tubulin in the
onset of other chemotherapy-related adverse sequelae such as nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity as well as idiopathic
or inherited forms of peripheral neuropathy in addition to CIPN."
10803941,"Abstract:
Microglia are the primary immune cells of the brain. These resident macrophages play critical roles not only in
immunity, but also in brain development and homeostasis. In the adult brain, microglia constantly extend and
retract their processes to survey the local environment and clear any pathological insults/injury. In the
Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, studies have identified activated microglia that surround amyloid-β plaques,
one of the central and hallmark pathologies of the disease, and transcriptional profiling of these cells has
identified a unique signature – termed disease-associated microglia (DAMs). However, it remains unclear
whether this microglial response to plaques is beneficial or harmful to disease. To address this question, we
have developed a novel inducible reporter mouse that allows for specific targeting of DAMs. This novel reporter
mouse produces destabilized Cre (ddCre) at the Cst7, a gene that highly and specifically upregulated in DAMs,
locus allowing us to effectively label or knockout Cst7 expression by the administration of trimethoprim (TMP).
TMP is non-toxic and avoids the caveats associated with CreERT2 system-dependent tamoxifen. Here, we will
use our Cst7ddCre line to evaluate the roles of TREM2, NLRP3, and CST7 in disease progression, and their
distinct function at different ages/disease stages, as well as the fate of DAM's following Ab immunotherapy. We
will assess behavior, cognition, glia, amyloid, tau, synapses, neurons, dystrophic neurites, NfL, as well as
explore gene expression changes (via bulk tissue RNAseq) and spatial transcriptomics (via MERFISH) utilizing
floxed Trem2, Nlrp3, or Cst7 KO mice crossed to 5xFAD or 5xFAD/hTau mice. These findings will elucidate the
distinct functions of DAMs during disease and provide insights into new therapeutic approaches for AD."
10804186,"Project Summary: Title: Preventing vascular calcification in kidney disease.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects roughly 9-10% of the world’s population and contributes directly to over
one million deaths annually. Mortality risk and morbidity in young CKD and dialysis patients correlates strongly
with vascular calcification severity (VC). The precise processes responsible for the build-up of mineral remain
unknown. Recent research has highlighted the likely role of calciprotein particles (CPPs) in initiation and
progression of VC. Calciprotein particles are small colloidal nanoparticles found in the circulation that induce the
calcification and osteogenic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Secondary crystalline calciprotein
particles (CCP2) that transform from primary amorphous particles (CPP1) play a major role in the VC process.
Importantly, as renal disease progresses a suppression of factors inhibiting CPP2 genesis occurs. Our
preliminary studies show reduced serum levels of a candidate factor “ASARM peptide” in CKD rodents and
patients with end-stage kidney disease. Importantly, CKD rodent models treated with synthetic ASARM peptide
have major and significant suppression of VC with improved renal function. We hypothesize ASARM peptide(s)
could play a significant role in the etiology of vascular calcification by interacting with CPPs. This study will
determine the utility of synthetic ASARM-peptide for preventing VC and the mechanisms involved. Also we will
determine whether abnormal expression or processing of circulating ASARM peptides occurs in patients with
CKD and determine if ASARM levels predict calcification propensity or associate with markers of calcification
risk."
10804412,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Migraine affects 15% of the world population, and is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Yet
surprisingly little is known about the basic features of this disease. One of the major questions in migraine is
how its quintessential feature, the migraine attack, is generated. For approximately a third of migraineurs, the
pain of the attack is preceded by an aura, typically a sensory hallucination. Unlike the attack, the aura is
physiologially measurable, in humans and in animal model systems, because its physiological correlate is a
massive cortical discharge called spreading depolarization (SD; also known as cortical spreading depression).
By understanding how SD is generated, we can understand how the attack begins. In our expiring award,
NS102978, we discovered events we call glutamate plumes: point-like glutamate discharges. Plumes occur
just prior to the onset of SD, generating a focus from which the wave arises, and suppressing plumes
significantly decreases the likelihood of SD induction. We thus identified a previously unknown proximate
mechanism in the induction of the migraine aura.
 But what causes plumes? The first aim addresses the subcellular mechanisms: In astrocytes, we will test
the hypothesis that depolarization underlies the failure in glutamate uptake required for plume generation. In
neurons, Calcium dependent neuronal vesicular release is the final step in plume generation. We will examine
extra- vs intracellular calcium sources to learn to what extent plumes represent truly noncanonical physiology,
vs. an exuberant form of normal synaptic transmission.
 We know that both astrocytes and neurons are required for plume generation, but we do not know
specifically how they interact, via what mediators, and in what sequence. In the second aim we examine the
interaction of neurons and astrocytes that we know is required for plume generation. We will use a combination
of fast two photon imaging, two photon linescan, and in vivo whole cell recording to determine the sequence of
neuronal and astrocytic activity that leads to plumes. Focal release of calcium, glutamate, and potassium with
uncaging techniques will help determine the minimum conditions necessary for plume induction. And we will
test the hypothesis that it is potassium released upon depolarization, rather than glutamate, that serves as the
primary agent of communication between the two cell types.
 Finally, How do plumes interact with other factors in the induction of SD? In the third aim, we examine the
mesoscale circuit level events required to generate SD. Novel potassium and voltage indicators will be used to
test the hypothesis that tonic increases in extracellular glutamate and potassium drive the more punctate
changes (plumes) that precede SD. Novel extracellular space indicators and diffusion measurements will help
test the hypothesis that the structural complexity of barrel cortex is a barrier to diffusion, contributing to the
accumulation of extracellular potassium and glutamate and thus to SD. We will test the hypothesis that plumes
drive a barrage of postsynaptic activity that contributes to SD ignition. Finally we will test the hypothesis that
this combination of reduced diffusion/reuptake and circuit excitability characteristics is what makes barrel
cortex so susceptible to SD.
 If successful our work will help understand the mechanism of a completely novel form of glutamate
signaling that is relevant not only to the migraine aura but to every neurologic disorder affected by SD. It will
reveal the precise interplay of neuronal and astrocytic mechanisms involved in the induction of the SD wave.
And it will delineate the mechanisms underlying the susceptibility of primary sensory cortex to aura."

The broad and long-term objective of our research inquiry is to develop receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
analysis towards a broadly applicable, practical, accurate, precise, efficient, and user-friendly method for
evaluation of diagnostic performance in medical imaging and beyond. The objective of this project is to
develop an innovative weighted ROC (WROC) analysis. The central hypothesis is that, by introducing a case
weighting factor, WROC analysis can mitigate and eliminate bias in ROC analysis from non-random case
samples and infer clinical performance without bias. Specific Aims are: (1) develop WROC algorithms and
share analysis software with the research community; (2) develop and validate three WROC analysis
applications; and (3) investigate with WROC analysis pivotal ROC study inference bias from non-random case
samples. Research design, based on contemporary ROC methodologies and preliminary studies, will be to
expand the basic ROC theory by introducing a weight factor to every case, and to develop WROC estimation
algorithms for common ROC models including the non-parametric, conventional binormal, and proper
binormal models, to develop new WROC software, which will supersede existing ROC software, and to make
the new software available to the research community by developing an open, easy-to-use, feature-rich, and
publication-friendly online calculator. New WROC algorithms will be used to develop three new applications:
to compare meaningfully ROC studies of non-random and non-identical case samples, to design ROC studies
with stratified case samples and then apply WROC analysis to model case sample distributions to match
random sampling and infer random-sample ROC performance without bias, and to estimate aggregate ROC
performance of multiple readers by averaging individual-reader ROC curves weighted by clinical case volume.
Finally, WROC analysis will be used to investigate bias in the inference to clinical performance from multi-
reader multi-case (MRMC) studies of non-random case samples and WROC analysis as a means to overcome
this bias. Methods to be used include mathematical derivation of maximum-likelihood estimations, software
development, and validation with Monte Calo simulations. The proposed WROC analysis is premised on
weighing cases unequally. This simple addition of a case weight will add a new dimension to ROC analysis.
Practical benefits include added analysis flexibility, improved clinical performance inference from laboratory
studies, and new ways to design better reader studies. The importance and health relatedness of this research
is that once developed, validated, and made available to and used by the research community, the new
development will be one step that advances ROC analysis towards a broadly applicable, practical, accurate,
precise, efficient, and user-friendly method for diagnostic performance evaluation."

Significance. Due to a global rise in life expectancy, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders
(NDs) represent a looming health crisis necessitating improvements in disease monitoring and treatment. NDs
cause cognitive decline through disruption of structure and connectivity in healthy brains which can only be de­
tected using brain images from multiple modalities. Specifically, images contain either structural information or
network information which must be linked via joint models to provide principled clinical inference. However, there
are few statistical models that integrate both types of information due to the difficult multimodal structure which
includes high­dimensional signals, complex correlations, and heterogenous data types. This lack of appropriate
methods not only limits the interpretation of clinical findings, but also has been shown to bias estimated effects,
reduce statistical efficiency, and increase sensitivity to noise. To this end, hierarchical Bayesian methods allow
structured information to be shared among brain images via their joint prior structure but have not been embraced
due to a lack of theoretical guarantees, computational bottlenecks, and difficulty specifying prior structures. This
proposal develops a new Bayesian framework to address the theoretical, inferential, and computational chal­
lenges of jointly modeling multimodal brain images. Viewing multiple brain images as multi­objects, we propose a
Bayesian object­oriented modeling (BOOM) framework for analyzing multi­object data that exploits object topology
while leveraging linkages among objects to perform inference, clustering, and prediction. Overall, the proposed
framework provides statisticians with much needed inferential and computational tools for high­dimensional im­
age analysis and allows clinical neuroscientists to fully leverage existing multimodal imaging datasets. The BOOM
framework will be distributed to the neuroimaging community via accessible software developed to study impactful
multimodal data collected by our collaborators to study NDs at the UC San Francisco Memory and Aging Center.
Innovation. Our proposal will be the first to develop Bayesian regression and supervised probabilistic clustering
with multi­object image predictors or responses, where at least one image is network valued and the rest are
a collection of spatially correlated cells. This provides significant innovation in estimation, Bayesian asymptotic
theory, and computation for structured Bayesian high­dimensional regression models.
Aims. We advance the following aims: 1) (Scalar on multi­object regression) To develop, apply, and evaluate
a Bayesian regression framework that provides inference and prediction for a scalar outcome as a function of a
multi­object predictor; 2) (Supervised clustering of multi­object data) To develop, apply, and evaluate a Bayesian
multi­object mixture modeling framework that enables supervised clustering of multi­object responses via their as­
sociation with a vector predictor; 3) (Object on multi­object regression) To develop, apply, and evaluate a Bayesian
regression framework that provides inference and prediction for an object outcome as a function of multi­object
predictor."
10803352,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Over the past decade the development of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in melanoma and other tumor
types has transformed the treatment options available for many patients with cancer. However, within
melanoma only approximately half of patients experience a durable response to treatment, with worse results
in most other tumor types. We and others have identified strategies to enhance anti-tumor immunity and
sensitize non-responsive murine melanoma tumors to ICB by targeting dsRNA pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs). These strategies include the agonism of the dsRNA sensor RIG-I and the loss of Adenosine
Deaminase Acting on dsRNA (ADAR1). We showed that ADAR1 is an innate inhibitory checkpoint in tumor
cells that limits anti-cancer immunity, and that targeting it therapeutically can trigger multiple dsRNA PRRs to
sensitize tumors to immunotherapy. Both RIG-I agonism and targeting ADAR1 resulted in enhanced cytokine
release in murine tumor microenvironments and improved the recruitment and control of tumors by T cells. In
recent work we have uncovered evidence that co-targeting multiple dsRNA sensing pathways induces
cooperative effects and enhances anti-tumor immunity compared with targeting single sensors. However,
several gaps in knowledge limit the translation of these strategies into effective therapies for patients. These
include: i) defining the optimal therapeutic strategy for targeting dsRNA PRRs; ii) understanding mechanisms
by which dsRNA sensing in tumors programs immune cell function; and iii) identifying the patients most likely
to respond to dsRNA-targeting therapeutics. To test the effects of dsRNA PRR stimulation on patient tumor
and immune samples ex vivo, we developed a novel perturbational single cell RNA sequencing approach.
Applying this strategy, we found that dsRNA stimulation of patient tumor and immune cells induces distinct T
cell programs of activation and survival and that these approaches may be most effective in tumors with high
pre-treatment levels of interferon signaling and adenosine-to-inosine dsRNA editing. In Aim 1 of this proposal,
we will test the hypothesis that co-targeting ADAR1 and RIG-I enhances the activation, proliferation and
function of anti-tumor T cells. We will explore mechanisms of this finding in mouse models including the
increased recruitment, activation and cross-presentation of tumor antigens by dendritic cells. In Aim 2 we will
seek to identify the tumor determinants of therapeutic response to targeting ADAR1 and uncover insights that
will facilitate the development of small molecule and nucleic acid therapeutics. If successful, the work
described in this proposal will help define the rules by which tumors and T cells respond to dsRNA stimulation
and advance the development of dsRNA-targeting strategies for melanoma and other tumors."
10803351,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 There is growing recognition that timing of behaviors, such as eating, sleeping, and physical activity, have a
significant impact on human health and disease risk. For example, when people are awake at the “wrong” time of the day
(i.e. during the biological night), a mismatch occurs between behavior and biology, termed circadian misalignment. Shift
workers experience repeated bouts of circadian misalignment and are at higher risk of cardiometabolic disease compared to
people who work days. However, the mechanism(s) by which shift work and associated circadian misalignment increase
disease risk are not clear. As a result, there have been few attempts to develop strategies to improve health in shift workers.
 Data from our group and others demonstrate that sleep and circadian disruption impair vascular endothelial function
and insulin sensitivity, two important risk factors for future development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Type 2
diabetes (T2D), together termed cardiometabolic disease. Furthermore, sleep and circadian disruption increase lipids in
plasma, including free fatty acids and ceramides, a class of lipids associated with cardiometabolic disease risk. We also find
increases in specific lipid species in muscle, such as 1,2 diacylglycerols during circadian disruption, which can directly
impair tissue-specific insulin signaling. Lastly, plasma lipids are elevated in shift workers; however, strategies that
specifically target lipids in shift workers have not yet been conducted.
 Using a circadian-based eating model (time-restricted eating; TRE), we and others can consistently reduce lipids in
circulation. TRE is also associated with reduced blood pressure and improved glucose homeostasis in healthy, lean adults
during inpatient conditions of simulated night shift work. Thus, the clear next step is to translate this strategy to improve
cardiometabolic disease risk in free-living shift workers who are neither young nor lean. The overall objective for this project
is to improve the cardiometabolic health of free-living shift workers. Our central hypothesis is that eliminating food intake
from the biological night (via TRE) will improve blood pressure, vascular function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose
homeostasis in shift workers. To test our hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized crossover study (4-week TRE vs. 4-
week controlled eating) in 50 non-rotating night shift workers (25F; >18y) with overweight or obesity. At the end of each
outpatient condition, we will conduct a rigorous 2-day inpatient assessment to determine the impact of TRE and associated
reductions in plasma and muscle lipids on blood pressure, vascular function, circulating markers of endothelial health, whole
body and muscle-specific insulin sensitivity, whole body glucose homeostasis, and muscle insulin signaling.
 Successful completion of the proposed study will identify a targetable mechanism to counter impairments in
vascular function and insulin sensitivity during shift work. The knowledge to be gained supports cost-effective programs to
minimize CVD and T2D in populations at elevated risk, including anyone working nonstandard hours. These populations
include workers in healthcare (nurses, doctors, paramedics), emergency services (military personnel, police, firefighters),
security, transportation (pilots and truck drivers), manufacturing (our commercial partner), and hospitality, as well as the
many individuals with sleep and circadian disorders."
10803353,"SUMMARY
 Notch signaling is a fundamental regulator of lymphatic growth, function and vessel homeostasis. Lymphatic
dysfunction is associated with many acquired human diseases, including liver fibrosis, psoriasis, metabolic
diseases, and cancer. The postnatal lymphatic endothelium dynamically expresses both Notch1 and Notch4, as
well as the Notch ligands, Jag1 and Dll4. Numerous therapies that target Notch pathway components are in
clinical development or trials. Thus, it is essential to understand the role of the distinct receptors and ligands of
the Notch pathway in the adult lymphatic vasculature.
 Downstream of Dll4- and Jag1-activation, we found that Notch1 and Notch4 have overlapping and distinct
transcriptional profiles in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), suggesting a dynamic role for Notch in LECs. Our
studies of Notch4-/- mice indicate that Notch4 regulates dermal lymphatic vascular patterning, while it is
necessary specifically in adult females for the regeneration and maintenance of dermal lymphatics. Using in vitro
studies, we show that Notch4 regulates proliferation, and VECADHERIN expression posttranslationally, which
in turn may affect LEC growth, responses to flow and barrier function. Postnatal deletion of LEC Notch4 using a
novel transgenic model led to reduced dermal capillary lymphatics and LEC proliferation and altered
VECADHERIN expression. Analysis of male N4LECKO mice revealed increased hepatic portal lymphatics
associated with multiple hallmarks of pathological liver disease and fibrosis.
 We hypothesize that Dll4 and Jag1 dynamically signal via Notch1 and Notch4 in capillary lymphatics
to maintain lymphatic vessel homeostasis and regeneration in the adult. To address these hypotheses, we
propose to 1) transcriptionally profile lymphatic endothelial Notch1 and Notch4 signaling downstream of Dll4 and
Jag1 activation using in vitro and in vivo approaches, 2) determine the mechanisms by which Notch4 functions
in the dermal lymphatic endothelium of the adult mice, and 3) determine the role of lymphatic endothelial Notch4
in the liver and a mouse model of dietary-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The goal is to
understand LEC Notch4 functions in lymphatic vascular maintenance and homeostasis and how its loss
contributes to pathogenic phenotypes in the skin and liver."
10803427,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our understanding of how chronic Mn may trigger or promote central nervous system (CNS) morbidities remains
fragmentary. Here, we seek to continue our studies into the mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity by focusing on
chronic exposures. Acute Mn cellular neurotoxicity occurs by alterations in cell signaling pathways that normally
rely on Mn for their function, e.g., insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/insulin metabolic signaling pathway (IIS), and
the highly interconnected mTOR (mTORC1 and mTORC2), AKT and ATM/p53 metabolic signaling systems.
Existing research strongly supports a mechanism of Mn neurotoxicity related to the fact that Mn-dependent
enzymes are situated at key regulatory nodes in these metabolic signaling pathways. New data support role for
two other signaling systems linked to healthy aging in chronic Mn neurotoxicity, the eIF2 and Sirtuin (SIRT)
signaling pathways. It is noteworthy that real-life Mn exposures in the human population occur over an extended
period, months to years, involving lower extracellular or intracellular levels of Mn not associated with cell death
in acute neurotoxicity studies. Mechanistic details underlying the biological changes that occur under chronic Mn
intoxication remain elusive and thus warrant further investigation. Moreover, it is highly likely that persistent Mn
effects are in a complex interplay with genetics, sex and age. Therefore, we seek to test the overarching
hypothesis that chronic Mn neurotoxicity is caused by long-term elevated Mn altering the activity of neuronal cell
signaling systems for which Mn normally acts as an essential co-factor that regulate healthy aging. To address
this overarching hypothesis we have designed three highly meritorious Specific Aims, namely (1) determine the
evolution of genetic pathways altered as Mn exposure extends from acute to chronic, and whether any such
effects are persistent after cessation of chronic Mn overload, (2) evaluate the concurrent and persistent functional
consequences of acute versus chronic Mn exposures and the influence of neural cell type, neurotransmitter-
type, and genetic sex on the magnitude versus types of genetic pathways and functional outcomes altered, and
(3) Explore the mechanistic basis of chronic/persistent Mn neurotoxicity phenotypes via metabolic analysis, with
pharmacological and genetic manipulation of signaling and metabolic pathways in C. elegans and hiPSC neural
model systems. Our highly interactive experimental design brings to bear innovative and complementary
expertise to assess shared genetic networks and functional outcomes of Mn-induced chronic neurotoxicity with
translation from C. elegans to humans."
10803003,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Liver transplantation offers the only definitive cure for end stage liver disease, but the organ shortage leaves
half of the wait list untransplanted, and 15-20% die before a liver becomes available. Over 60,000 more a year
die without ever making it to the wait list. Unfortunately, many donated livers are untransplantable, 40-60%
because of fatty infiltration, or steatosis, which has increasingly adverse effects on outcomes with increasing
severity. At 60% steatosis, poor function prohibits transplantation, and even at lower percent fat, outcomes are
sub-optimal and exacerbated by other risk factors, such as extended cold ischemia times. Steatosis in donors
will only increase with time, as the prevalence of fatty liver disease continues to rise, having more than doubled
over the last 20 years.
 Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has been shown to decrease discard rates of liver donated for
transplantation by 50%. NMP has even been used to rescue livers that have declined for transplantation in
smaller case series. Unfortunately, only a small number of livers in those reports were steatotic, and there is
very little information on the effect of NMP on steatotic livers. Poor outcomes after fatty liver transplantation are
attributed to abnormalities in the microvascular circulation and increased sensitivity to ischemia reperfusion injury
(IRI), including impaired ATP recovery, increased oxidative damage, and eventual hepatocyte death. As
steatotic livers have intrinsic defects, and not just ischemic injury, it is not clear whether NMP would have the
same salutary effect as it does for other types. We have performed research NMP on a large number of discarded
steatotic livers and that 50-80% of them would be considered viable for transplantation based on criteria used in
these trials that had good post-transplant outcomes, so we propose a small pilot study to transplant such livers
in appropriate recipients and also perform transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, comparing transplantable
and non-transplantable livers.
 The ability to safely transplant fatty livers would expand the donor pool significantly and save thousands of
patients per year. In addition, the transcriptomic and metabolomic data obtained from these models will provide
strategies for rescuing non-transplantable livers and new insight into the treatment and prevention of fatty liver
disease, ultimately decreasing the need for liver transplantation."
10802747,"Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) impose a significant healthcare burden and reduce quality
of life. This is especially true in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who experience
LUTS as a comorbidity. Existing therapies largely just treat symptoms because LUTS etiology is
not fully understood and likely multifactorial. Developmental exposure to environmental toxicants
alone or in combination with genetic susceptibilities can influence disease progression in other
organs; whether this paradigm is true for LUTS is unknown. Our goal is to fill this gap by examining
how environmental factors negatively impact Ca2+ dependent bladder contractility pathways.
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), can disrupt Ca2+ signaling pathways in brain and we have
shown that developmental PCB exposure leads to an overactive bladder phenotype in young
adult mice. Here we propose to test the hypothesis that developmental exposure to PCBs
increases bladder contractility leading to overactive voiding symptoms in part by upregulating BK
channel regulatory subunits. BK channels (large conductance calcium- and voltage-activated K+
channel, KCNM) are important for dampening bladder contractions but their efficiency can be
altered by regulatory subunits. Our central hypothesis is supported by key pieces of preliminary
data. Bladders from adult mice developmentally exposed to PCBs are more sensitive to
contractile stimuli, and have increased expression of two BK channel regulatory subunits that can
slow BK channel activity. Mutations in BK channels have been linked to ASD, and mice completely
lacking BK channels display bladder overactivity phenotypes. Whether PCBs converge on these
channels to confer heightened LUTS risk alone or in relation to ASD is unknown. The following
aims are designed to examine this gene x environment interaction and further expand
understanding of mechanisms by which PCBs alter bladder contractility. We will test our
hypothesis in three aims. The first testing whether in utero and lactational PCB exposure leads to
changes in bladder contractility via pre-junctional and post-junctional mechanisms. The second
testing whether BK channel regulatory subunits mediate PCB effects on contractility and that a
pharmacological BK channel opener can ameliorate abnormal voiding phenotypes. The third
testing whether gene x environment interactions relevant to ASD and LUTS may converge on BK
channel activity. For these aims we will use genetic mouse models as well as in vivo and ex vivo
tissue bath applications to determine voiding function/bladder contractility which will allow us to
understand the mechanisms driving PCB induced changes in contractility and whether
pharmacological intervention to open BK channels mitigates PCB effects on contractility."
10803226,"Chronic alcohol use is prevalent among the veteran population and can permanently alter brain function and
exacerbate existing health conditions. There is a growing literature that alcohol use may exacerbate chronic pain
and predispose to pain disorders, but the neural mechanisms are still unknown. Our preliminary data suggests
that mice exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exhibit increased pain sensitivity, hyperexcitability of
serotonin (5-HT) neurons, and elevated 5-HT immunoreactivity in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Ablation of
5-HT neurons in the DRN also reduced nociception in the Von Frey test, suggesting that hyperactivity in these
neurons following CIE may facilitate pain. DRN neurons project principally to the forebrain and have excitatory,
5-HT-mediated input to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), which can also facilitate pain via
projections to the central amygdala (CeA). At the same time, CIE reduced tryptophan-hydroxylase 2 (Tph2)
expression in the raphe magnus (RMg), which is another serotonergic nucleus that projects to the dorsal horn
(DH) of the spinal cord and may promote anti-nociception.
The overarching goal of this application is to investigate two discrete serotonergic mechanisms of alcohol-
induced hyperalgesia. We propose that CIE increases activity in the 5-HT DRN→PVT pathway that facilities
pain and decreases activity in the 5HT RMg→DH pathway that inhibits pain. In Aim 1, we will examine the
effects of CIE on activity in 5-HT DRN→PVT projection neurons using in vivo fiber photometry and ex vivo slice
electrophysiology as complementary approaches. We will then examine 5-HT release dynamics in the PVT with
fiber photometry, followed by slice electrophysiology to dissect the effect of this enhanced 5-HT release on neural
activity in PVT→CeA neurons. We will then determine whether CIE can alter 5-HT receptor expression in
PVT→CeA projection neurons using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and RT-PCR. These
experiments will reveal whether CIE can promote 5-HT signaling in the PVT and activate PVT projections to the
CeA that facilitate pain. Aim 2 will investigate the effects of CIE on 5-HT RMg neurons using similar approaches
as in Aim 1. We will also examine pain-evoked activity in DH neurons receiving input from 5-HT RMg neurons
using fos immunohistochemistry. 5-HT receptor gene expression in DH neurons receiving input from the RMg
will also be examined using a combination of TRAP and RT-PCR. Finally in Aim 3, we will evaluate the respective
contributions of the 5-HT DRN→ PVT and 5-HT RMg→DH pathways to pain and alcohol-induced hyperalgesia
using multiplexed DREADDS that enable simultaneous manipulation of both pathways in the same animals.
Together, these experiments will generate mechanistic insight into the role of chronic alcohol abuse in
predisposing to and precipitating pain disorders."
10804566,"Chronic pain, that is, pain that persists or recurs for 3 months or more, affects 20 % of adults in the United
States and contributes to an annual economic cost of greater than $600 billion and is more prevalent among
Veterans compared to non-Veterans with significantly higher rates of chronic pain in women veterans.
Noninvasive neuromodulation holds promise as a therapeutic approach to treat chronic pain conditions, but
current noninvasive neuromodulation techniques lack spatial specificity and are unable to modulate deep
neural structures. Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) is a noninvasive method to inhibit cortical and deep
brain regions. LIFU can reach deep brain regions and has spatial specificity. For chronic pain, one promising
brain target for treatment is the insular cortex, a brain structure whose function is linked to pain processing.
The insula is a critical brain region which is activated in the response to painful stimuli and in chronic pain
states, underlying central sensitization(CS) which occurs in chronic pain syndromes. Our recent pilot data in
healthy controls demonstrates that LIFU can target with spatial specificity subregions of the insula; LIFU to the
posterior insula (PI) reduces contact heat evoked potentials as well as temporal summation of pain(TSP) and
conditioned pain modulation (CPM) which are laboratory measures of somatosensory pain processing that are
altered in CS. LIFU can selectively target the insula and its subregions and provides a potentially
transformative method to reduce pain and the processes in chronic pain states that constitute CS which
amplify chronic pain disorders. We will administer inhibitory LIFU to the PI in individuals with chronic back
pain(CBP) with symptoms of widespread pain, a population that demonstrates symptoms of CS. We will inhibit
the PI to determine whether there is a causal role for this brain region in altered processes of CS as measured
by heat pain thresholds, TSP, and CPM all of which are hallmark features of chronic pain syndromes with CS.
As an LIFU control condition we will use sham LIFU with auditory masking to the insula; the sham condition
has been shown to be indistinguishable from active LIFU. We also propose to examine the effects of LIFU to
PI compared to sham on patterns of blood level oxygen dependent (BOLD) activity during evoked thermal pain
and resting state. Specifically, we will examine the effect of LIFU to PI compared to sham on the 1) BOLD
response to thermal stimuli in the Neurologic Pain Signature(NPS)which is a multivariate outcome whose
magnitude predicts clinical pain intensity and 2) resting state functional connectivity during tonic pain in the
Tonic Pain Signature (ToPS) which also predicts clinical pain intensity. Both the NPS and ToPS are sensitive
to and specific for physical pain and have been replicated in studies of chronic pain patients. We hypothesize,
given our pilot data, that inhibitory LIFU to PI will increase pain thresholds, reduce temporal summation and
facilitate conditioned pain modulation. LIFU to PI compared to sham will reduce the magnitude of the NPS
and ToPS. The magnitude of the NPS and ToPS will be positively correlated with pain intensity ratings during
task-based and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic
treatment for chronic pain have limited efficacy. There is a need in the veteran population for safe-effective
treatments for chronic pain. LIFU provides an ability to transiently and selectively inhibit this critical brain area
to determine its causal role in chronic pain which then may lead to improved treatments for chronic pain."

The current standard of care for evaluation and surveillance of regional and metastatic disease
in advanced stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is 18F-FDG-PET/CT
scan, which is highly sensitive but not specific and as a result identifies a significant number of
indeterminate lesions. Interrogation of these lesions leads to unnecessary procedures,
overdiagnosis/upstaging, patient anxiety, increased cost, and possible treatment delays due to
the need for repeat imaging. To address this, we will investigate whether PET imaging using a
radiolabeled anti-EGFR antibody (89Zr-panitumumab) can be used to detect cancer with high
specificity. We will use 89Zr-panitumumab PET/CT to assess HNSCC patients with
indeterminate findings on 18F-FDG PET/CT and determine the positive predictive value of 89Zr-
pan PET/CT for detection of metastatic disease. The nonspecific nature of 18F-FDG-PET/CT
also limits its usefulness in detecting small primary tumors in patients with oropharyngeal
cancer. This study will assess the effectiveness of 89Zr-pan PET/CT imaging for detecting
unknown primary tumors in patients presenting with an enlarged neck node without identification
of the primary tumor on exam or conventional imaging. Successful detection of the primary
tumor using 89Zr-pan PET/CT would avoid the invasive biopsies typically required to locate the
primary tumor in these patients. The novel imaging modality developed in this study could
overcome the limitations of metabolic 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging, thereby reducing the number
of invasive procedures and avoiding delays in treatment due to indeterminate findings."
10803611,"The goal of our proposed Small Project is to develop an intrathecal administrative approach using Romidepsin
in for the purpose of treating spasticity. This study includes efficacy and safety primary outcomes, and
mechanistic exploratory outcome measures. Results from this project will allow us to determine the longer-term
effectiveness of low-dose, chronic Romidepsin administration through an IT route, and general safety of this
translational approach.
We will carry out two objectives to address the goal of this project.
In objective 1 we will establish the effectiveness of low dose, chronic IT delivery of Romidepsin on H-reflex
hyperexcitability associated with post-SCI spasticity. We have previously shown that acute intraperitoneal (IP)
delivery of Romidepsin is effective in altering dendritic spine dysgenesis in spinal motor neurons, and that it
can effectively reduce nociceptive, sensory neuron hyperexcitability in a burn-inflammatory model. Additionally,
our preliminary data show that IP delivery of Romidepsin in SCI mice reduces H-reflex hyperexcitability.
Because spasticity is an ongoing, chronic disease, however, acute injectable systemic treatments have limited
clinical value. As such, we now seek to understand the efficacy and safety of long-term infusion using a
clinically relevant drug delivery method using the clinically established intrathecal catheter infusion method.
[In objective 2 To assess Romidepsin effectiveness with the IT route, we will compare spasticity and health
outcomes of SCI mice receiving IV treatment of Romidepsin—the currently established clinical delivery method
for T-cell lymphoma in humans (Yang, 2011). Here, Romidepsin will be injected into the lateral tail vein in mice
(i.e. IV infused). IV delivery carries the advantage of flexibility in that the drug delivery can be easily adjusted.
However, IV can lead to systemic side effects and has limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier which
limits its efficacy for CNS injury and disease. Here, we will determine if IT or IV delivery of Romidepsin is
equivalent (or superior) in attenuating the underlying pathology, e.g., loss of rate dependent depression (RDD)
of the evoked H-reflex, of spasticity following SCI.]
In summary, this project will establish a translational low dose IT delivery system of Romidepsin directly to the
spinal cord following SCI (Objective 1). [It will also gather comparative data against spasticity treatment with
IV-infused Romidepsin following SCI (Objective 2).]"
10844528,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Identifying the causes of autism spectrum disorder has proven to be a significant challenge. Both genetic and
environmental risk factors contribute to the development of autism. However, despite being estimated to
account for 41% of autism risk, we know very little about the environmental risk factors of autism. Moreover,
current systems that we are using to study how environmental factors influence autism risk, such as rodent
models, are slow and laborious, and therefore not suitable for conducting large-scale systematic investigations.
My long-term goal is to study the effect of environmental factors on the development of autism. Because social
deficit is one of the 2 core symptoms of autism, I developed a high-throughput screening method to
systematically search for chemicals that inhibit the development of social behavior in zebrafish. Using this
system, I screened 1120 compounds, and identified a group of compounds - topoisomerase II (Top2) inhibitors
- that effectively inhibited the normal development of social behavior in zebrafish. Prenatal exposure to the
Top2 inhibitor ICRF-193 in mouse also induced behavioral defects related to the two core symptoms of autism.
The main objective of this grant is to characterize the role of Top2 in the development of social behavior. Top2
is involved in gene regulation during brain development. Its two isoforms Top2a and Top2b are expressed in
dividing and postmitotic tissues, respectively, during development, and modulate the expression of distinct sets
of developmental genes. Top2 also regulates DNA methylation by binding to Uhrf1, a key adapter for Dnmt1.
My preliminary results demonstrated that: 1) Top2a rather than Top2b is likely to be the biological target
responsible for the social deficit phenotype; 2) chemical inhibition of Dnmts phenocopied Top2 inhibition and
induced a similar social deficit phenotype in zebrafish; and 3) transient overexpression of Dnmt1 in zebrafish
embryos rescued the social deficit phenotype induced by Top2 inhibitors. In addition, previous literatures have
linked human mutations in TOP2A, TOP2B, and DNMT1 to increased autism risk.
I thus propose the central hypothesis that Top2 plays a critical role in the development of social behavior
through regulation of Dnmt1 and DNA methylation, and disruption of this pathway leads to deficits in sociality
and other autism-related behaviors. To test this hypothesis, I propose to: 1) determine which Top2 isoform
(Top2a or Top2b) is responsible for the social deficit phenotype induced by Top2 inhibition; 2) investigate the
role of Dnmt1 and global DNA methylation in the development of social deficit following Top2 inhibition; and 3)
To systematically discover environmental factors that affect the development of social behavior by screening
the Tox21 library. Together, my proposed studies will have a broad impact on the field and may ultimately
reveal novel therapeutic targets to prevent or treat autism."
10784998,"PROJECT SUMMARY: “Targeting the Androgen Receptor in Bladder Cancer to Enhance Sensitivity to
Immune Checkpoint Blockade”.
Up to 70-80% of patients with bladder cancer demonstrate de novo resistance to PD-1/PDL-1 immune
checkpoint blockade (ICB). Of those patients that initially respond to ICB, most ultimately develop resistance [1-
5]. These data support the investigation of additional cooperative targets which may sensitize bladder cancers
to immunomodulatory therapies. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care treatment for
prostate cancer patients. However, ADT has also proven to delay progression of AR positive bladder cancers
and, thus, offers a potentially viable co-target for enhancing the activity of clinically approved PD-1/PDL-1
targeting agents. Emerging evidence in prostate cancer supports an AR-dependent mechanism regulating ICB
response whereby T cell intrinsic expression of AR blocks T cell activity and differentiation.
We hypothesize that clinically approved ADTs, including gonadal castration and AR targeted inhibitors, will
promote the function of tumor infiltrating T cells while concomitantly inhibiting androgen sensitive epithelia in
bladder tumors. We have developed preclinical mouse models and techniques that will test the impact of ADT
on early and late-stage bladder cancer progression. We will leverage established methods in single cell
transcriptomics to understand the mechanism(s) of how ADT could alter the immune microenvironment to
sensitize tumors to ICB. To further understand the cell intrinsic role of AR, we will leverage an established
preclinical model in the Mulholland laboratory to genetically disrupt AR expression in specifically in T cells.
Our team. We will use an effective collaboration between experts in the field of cancer modeling, oncology,
urology, bioinformatics and statistics. The translational research team consists of: David Mulholland, PhD
(preclinical mouse modeling), Matthew Galsky, M.D. (GU oncology), John Sfakianos M.D. (surgical urology),
Ernesto Guccione, PhD (bioinformatics), and Madhu Mazumdar, PhD (biostatistics).
Impact. If successful, our exploratory studies will generate data that is highly impactful for bladder cancer
patients who are poorly responsive to standard of care immunomodulatory therapies."
10785000,"Project Summary/Abstract
Over 2 million people in the United States with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) engage in
some form of severe problem behavior (SPB; self-injury, aggression; Crocker et al., 2006). Behavioral
treatments for SPB are predicated on identifying effective reinforcers that increase appropriate behavior and
maintain low levels of SPB. Unfortunately, the reinforcing efficacy of putative reinforcers identified using typical
clinical approaches often diminish over time or are not suitable for varied real-world application (e.g., Roane et
al., 1998). There are important dimensions of reinforcement that have been discovered in basic behavioral
research that have not yet been translated into applied practice. Such dimensions move beyond simple
measures of relative reinforcing value typically assayed in clinical domains via stimulus preference
assessments (Fisher et al., 1992) and related methodologies (e.g.; Lee et al., 2008; Leon et al., 2021;
Hagopian et al., 2020), and instead focus on the conditions under which, and how quickly, the effects of
reinforcement are established, maximized, and diminished. These dimensions of reinforcement interact with
schedule arrangements and response requirements to yield patterns of schedule performance that ultimately
determine the conditional effectiveness of a given reinforcer on which behavioral interventions may be
predicated. We posit that a multivariate analysis of these dimensions can enhance our understanding of the
stimulus properties of various reinforcers and operant contingencies used within behavioral interventions for
SPB. This may allow practitioners to disentangle relative reinforcer value from variables related to
sensorimotor performance and changes in motivation related to time, satiation, and other factors. Based on our
recent research findings, pilot assessment data, and clinical experience, this proposal describes an enhanced
methodology leveraging a quantitative model of schedule performance (Mathematical Principles of
Reinforcement; Killeen, 1994) to identify effective and durable reinforcers for use within behavioral
interventions using a translational-treatment approach. In addition to the practical benefits of identifying more
effective and durable reinforcers, this work will also advance knowledge on the underpinnings of response
strength and behavioral persistence of schedule-controlled behavior, which will have scientific value. Using a
translational-treatment approach, we will seek to identify (1) specific schedule arrangements that maximize
responding (which directly impacts interventions predicated on response competition) and (2) reinforcers that
are associated with minimal resurgence (i.e., the recurrence of a previously eliminated response when the
reinforcement conditions for an alternative response are worsened) following reinforcement omission errors."
10785483,"Project Summary:
Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death and is associated with diverse range of oncogenic
alterations. These driver mutations impact clinical outcomes, disease prognosis and response to therapy.
Treatment options for liver cancer include a few multi-kinase inhibitors and surgical resection, providing only
limited survival benefits. To this end, genotype-guided therapeutic approaches are urgently needed in clinics.
Metabolism-focused approaches have recently gained interest to be explored as anti-cancer therapy. However,
it is poorly understood how specific oncogenic alterations impact tumor metabolism and which tumors would
benefit from metabolism-based therapies. Given the complex cellular and nutritional composition of tumors,
studying tumor metabolism at cellular resolution is quite challenging. In this study, I propose a way to overcome
this challenge by employing an organelle pull-down technology and profiling mitochondrial metabolites of cancer
cells from highly heterogeneous tumor tissues. In my preliminary work, I focused on mitochondria, a central
biosynthetic hub for cellular metabolism, applied the mitochondrial immunoprecipitation method (mito-IP) to
capture cancer cell mitochondria from in vivo transformed liver tumors driven by different oncogenic alterations,
including c-MYC; p53-/- and KrasG12D; p53-/-. This approach enabled mitochondrial metabolite profiling by LC/MS
and identified metabolite changes specific to each oncogenic alteration. In particular, I found enrichment of
creatine metabolism intermediates; guanidinoacetate, creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine (P-Cr), specifically in
KrasG12D tumors. Mitochondrial proteomics corroborated these findings, revealed upregulation of Gatm, the rate
limiting enzyme in creatine biosynthesis, in KrasG12D tumors. Building upon these findings, in this proposal, I will
test the central hypothesis that oncogenes impose distinct metabolic alterations in mitochondria, which can be
exploited as targeted therapies. I will first test the essentiality of creatine metabolism for KrasG12D -mutant liver
tumor growth. Then, I will determine the precise mechanisms by which creatine metabolism contributes to
KrasG12D-driven tumorigenesis. Finally, given the success of my in vivo mito-IP approach, I will model frequent
liver cancer mutations to map differentially regulated mitochondrial metabolites and proteins, and identify limiting
metabolic reactions through unbiased genetic screens. By addressing the aims of this proposal, we will gain
mechanistic insight into downstream metabolic effects of oncogenic alterations and potential of genotype-
targeted metabolic therapies for targeting liver cancer. Collectively, these aims will provide foundations of my
future research program committed to understanding how oncogenes (genetic determinants) alter cancer cell
metabolism in vivo, with the goal of exploiting such alterations for genotype-targeted metabolic therapies."
10785910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 60% of hemiparetic stroke-survivors experience significant chronic motor deficits in their paretic
upper limb, typically caused by damage to the corticospinal tract (CST). Alternative neural pathways, such as
the cortico-reticulospinal tract (CRST), can be recruited to achieve movement of the affected arm and hand, but
may have undesirable consequences. For example, the diffuse, bilateral branching of reticulospinal neurons can
produce abnormal muscle co-activations (synergies) in the paretic limb, and involuntary mirror movements
(associated reactions) between limbs. Together, these effects create stereotypical movement patterns post-
stroke, and there is growing interest in novel ""anti-synergy"" interventions to enhance usage of residual CST
systems rather than strengthening the CRST. Imaging has the potential to become an invaluable tool for
evaluating whether rehabilitative strategies can preferentially access CST versus CRST pathways. However,
current functional imaging research has focused on cortical activity, and must theoretically infer what pathway is
used. Structural MRI can directly assess changes in white matter pathways, but it is limited to detecting long-
term plasticity. To guide new interventions, there is a critical need to directly evaluate what descending motor
pathways are active during specific movements. Thus, the overall objective of this study is to generate a novel
fMRI dataset in participants with post-stroke hemiparesis, capturing neural activity during unilateral hand-
grasping throughout the CST and CRST, and to evaluate differences when grasping with the paretic versus non-
paretic hand. Our lab has developed advanced strategies to improve fMRI signal quality, but we show that large
datasets per person are still needed to accurately localize and interpret activation patterns; this is challenging in
stroke-survivors, who may fatigue quickly. Our innovative MRI-compatible hand-grip device provides supported,
adjustable arm positioning and real-time force feedback, allowing us to reproduce a motor task across multiple
sessions and generate sufficient data. In Aim 1, we acquire multi-echo fMRI data in the brain and brainstem; we
hypothesize that increased reliance on the CRST will cause increased ipsilateral cortical and brainstem activation
when grasping with the paretic limb, and that this will correlate with functional impairment (Upper-Extremity Fugl-
Meyer Assessment). In Aim 2, we acquire fMRI data in the spinal cord; we hypothesize that grasping with the
paretic hand will be associated with increased activation in more superior cord segments (intra-limb synergies)
and grasping with the non-paretic hand will correspond to increased activation in the contralateral hemi-cord
(associated reactions). We will also explore how neural activity correlates with individual EMG measures of
muscle co-activation. This work is significant because it will provide direct evidence of descending motor pathway
involvement in post-stroke hemiparesis, and demonstrate the utility of neuroimaging for identifying physical and
pharmacological interventions to reduce reliance on CRST and drive more effective rehabilitation."

on these processes in relation to LRRK2. Specifically, this project examines (i) the oxidative activation of LRRK2,
(ii) the translocation of LRRK2 to mitochondria under conditions of mitochondrial stress, and (iii) LRRK2 kinase
activity-dependent oxidative stress. The overarching premise of this proposal is that oxidative stress and LRRK2
kinase activity are intimately and bidirectionally intertwined in PD pathogenesis.
The project has 3 broad Specific Aims to address these issues:
Aim 1: To elucidate the oxidative activation of LRRK2 kinase, we will (a) assess/compare WT LRRK2 activation
by physiological stressors (H2O2, 4HNE and DA) to the PD-associated toxicants: rotenone, paraquat (PQ) and
trichloroethylene (TCE); (b) Determine whether monensin & chloroquine activate LRRK2 via oxidative
mechanisms; (c) Examine the role of cysteine residues C2024/5 in oxidative LRRK2 activation.
Aim 2: To examine translocation of LRRRK2 to mitochondria, we will (a) Assess mitochondrial localization of
LRRK2 in response to various mitochondrial stressors; (b) See if translocation requires (i) mitochondrial ROS,
(ii) cytosolic ROS, (iii) LRRK2 activity or (iv) Cys2024/5; (c) Determine whether mitochondrial translocation of
LRRK2 occurs in vivo in rat models of PD; (d) Evaluate whether LRRK2 association with mitochondria is
aberrantly enhanced in human iPD brain tissue.
Aim 3: To elucidate the role of LRRK2 kinase in oxidative stress and its downstream consequences, we will (a)
Use genetic and pharmacological approaches to see if pathogenic LRRK2 mutations cause oxidative stress and
whether blocking LRRK2 kinase activity prevents oxidative stress; (b) Examine the potential role of Cys2024/5
in driving LRRK2 kinase activity-dependent oxidative stress; (c) Determine if rotenone-induced mitochondrial
ROS production is reduced by LRRK2 inhibition/knockout; (d) Determine if rotenone-induced cytosolic NOX2
activation is reduced by LRRK2 inhibition/knockout; (e) Assess ROS production in patient-derived healthy
control, iPD and G2019S mutant lymphoblastoid cells.
Together, these experiments will begin to elucidate the intimate and bidirectional relationship between oxidative
stress and LRRK2 in PD pathogenesis. By doing so, new therapeutic strategies are likely to emerge."

The long-term objective of this project is to develop Dr. Romanos-Nanclares’s capacity to conduct studies that
integrate dietary and lifestyle factors with multi-omics data and traditional biomarkers to better understand the
biological pathways underlying the etiology of aggressive forms of breast cancer and to advance the field of
precision nutrition for cancer prevention. The proposed research combines ‘omics methodologies with advanced
statistical techniques to investigate the role of chronic inflammation in the etiology of breast cancer. Chronic
inflammation has been identified as a possible risk factor in the development of breast cancer, including estrogen
receptor negative breast cancer, which is a subtype of breast cancer that is associated with poorer prognosis
and is less responsive to hormonal therapies. The foundation for this proposal is based on our recent findings
where a higher adherence to an Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (EDIP) score (or a more pro-
inflammatory diet) was associated with increased breast cancer risk, particularly for tumors lacking estrogen
receptor expression. Leveraging the unique design and wealth of resources in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS)
and Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), with repeated dietary measures and prediagnostic plasma specimens, this
application will combine dietary and ‘omics data from multiple biological dimensions with cutting-edge
epidemiological and bioinformatics methodologies to examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and
invasive breast cancer risk and estrogen receptor subtypes. In Aim 1 (K99), she will examine the associations
of plasma metabolomic profiles of EDIP with subsequent risk of breast cancer in the NHS and NHSII among
1,997 cases and their matched controls. In Aim 2 (R00), she will use an agnostic approach to identify the
associations of plasma proteomics with risk of breast cancer in the NHS and NHSII among 200 cases and their
matched controls. In Aim 3 (R00), she will integrate multi-omics data, including metabolomics, proteomics, and
transcriptomics, to characterize the role of inflammation in breast cancer etiology. This research will provide
novel evidence, enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in breast cancer etiology,
and help identify new prevention strategies for more aggressive forms of the disease. Dr. Romanos-Nanclares’s
scientific aims are supported by three training objectives that will allow her to advance her trajectory toward
becoming an independent investigator: 1) single-omics and multi-omics methodologies and advanced analytics;
2) proteomics study design and execution; and 3) breast cancer etiology and pathophysiology. The training
environment at Brigham and Women’s Hospital will provide exceptional support for Dr. Romanos-Nanclares as
she pursues these development and scientific goals. She has assembled an outstanding interdisciplinary
mentoring team with expertise in cancer epidemiology, multi-omics bioinformatics, breast cancer pathology,
proteomics, and metabolomics. This K99/R00 award will help Dr. Romanos-Nanclares acquire the knowledge
and experience necessary to launch her career as an independent investigator."
10805854,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the US, an adult suffers a myocardial infarction (MI) every 40 seconds. Over 35% of MI patients develop
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms within 1 month, increasing risk of 1-year rehospitalization and
mortality in a dose-response manner. However, biobehavioral pathways whereby PTSD symptoms lead to
rehospitalization and mortality have yet to be identified. Given PTSD symptoms potentiate stress reactivity and
patients show greater stress reactivity after a MI, stress reactivity is a promising mechanism to study in the
association between PTSD symptoms and proximal cardiovascular health outcomes such as ambulatory blood
pressure (ABP). The objective of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23)
is to provide Dr. Sharon Lee, the candidate, with necessary training to become an independent clinical scientist
with expertise in the biobehavioral mechanisms linking PTSD symptoms and cardiovascular disease risk. To
prepare Dr. Lee to become an independent investigator by the completion of this award, mentored training will
address four domains: (1) psychophysiology of cardiovascular stress reactivity, (2) methodologies in ecological
momentary assessment and ABP monitoring, (3) epidemiology of MI and post-MI clinical outcomes, and (4)
professional development into an independent clinical scientist in cardiovascular behavioral medicine. The
proposed intensive longitudinal study focuses on the potential mechanistic role of psychological and
physiological stress reactivity in the association between PTSD symptoms and 24-hour ABP in MI patients. Dr.
Lee will leverage ecological momentary assessment including ABP monitoring to examine the association
between PTSD symptoms and stress reactivity (momentary perceived stress and ABP reactivity) as it unfolds
during the 6-month post-MI adjustment period. Data collection will occur at three time points, each consisting of
a gold-standard clinical assessment of PTSD symptoms followed by a 7-day ecological momentary
assessment with a 24-hour period of ABP monitoring. The following specific aims will be achieved: (1) Test the
intraindividual association between PTSD symptoms and stress reactivity and (2) test the role of stress
reactivity in the intraindividual association between PTSD symptoms and 24-hour ABP. Dr. Lee has assembled
an expert mentorship team of leading scientists in the fields of clinical psychology, experimental medicine,
behavioral cardiology, preventive cardiology, cardiovascular epidemiology, and intensive longitudinal modeling.
The Miriam Hospital and Alpert Medical School of Brown University are ideally resourced environments for Dr.
Lee to successfully carry out the proposed training and study. Dr. Lee’s K23 training plan and project align with
the NHLBI Research Priority regarding mechanisms whereby psychosocial stress contributes to ischemic heart
disease progression. To this end, Dr. Lee will emerge from this five-year mentored award as an independent
investigator who will contribute to our knowledge about stress reactivity as a modifiable mechanism for
disrupting the relationship between PTSD symptoms and poor cardiovascular health in MI patients."
10805697,"The recent FDA approval of Leqembi (Lecanemab) for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has spurred great optimism,
and this approval also likely opens a door for preventive treatment for AD. However, currently available PET
tracers have limited capacity for this preventive purpose. More sensitive new PET tracers are highly desirable.
Amyloid beta (A), is an appealing AD biomarker, as significant initial deposits of A precede Tau pathology.
Accordingly, the 2018 A/T/N Research Framework published by NIA-AA (National Institute of Ageing and
Alzheimer’s Association) suggests that As are the earliest biomarkers for AD before the appearance of
irreversible neurologic syndromes.
A species can be categorized into soluble and insoluble species. Studies show that soluble Aβs, such as
oligomers, are more neurotoxic than insoluble deposits (fibrils and plaques) and serve as biomarkers for pre-
symptomatic stages of AD. In fact, abnormal A levels in brains appear 30 years before symptoms are observed
in humans. Unfortunately, the first-generation (1stG) A PET probes are insensitive and only marginally detect
abnormal A deposits ~ 5 years before clinical AD syndrome diagnosis. This leaves a 25-year gap for which AD
will progress undetectable. The intrinsic limitation of the 1stG PET tracers is their insensitivity to soluble As, the
best biomarker for pre-symptomatic AD. Preliminary results from the PI’s group over the past ten years suggest
that this intrinsic limitation can be overcome with CRANAD-Xs, a series of probes capable of detecting not only
insoluble Aβs but also soluble Aβs in vitro and in vivo. In this application, we propose to adapt our fluorescent
CRANAD-X probes into sensitive Aβ PET tracers to fill the 25-year gap. Expected long-term impact. The
proposed A PET tracers will allow more sensitive detection vs. 1stG PET tracers and consequentially allow
identification of AD patients at an earlier pre-symptomatic stage that is likely more responsive to treatment."
10805705,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objective of this study is to determine epigenetic mechanisms that impact genomic imprinting upon in utero
exposure of mice to human-relevant levels of lead (Pb). Pb is an infamous environmental exposure to human
populations in the US and around the world, due in part to its neurotoxic effects. Pb exposure during early
development has been linked to adverse health outcomes later in life. Preliminary data generated for this grant
indicates that in utero and perinatal Pb exposure increases placenta/embryo size, and alters the DNA
methylation of imprinted genes, respectively. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Pb exposure
reprograms genomic imprinting during early gestation remain largely unknown. Imprinted genes are
epigenetically regulated in a parent-of-origin specific manner with their mono-allelic expression driving critical
periods of development. Known mechanisms of genomic imprinting include the 1) long non-coding RNA
(lncRNA) and 2) insulator models, each of which program allele-specific regulation of imprinting control
regions. Although dysfunctional genomic imprinting is implicated in several human diseases, the mechanisms
leading to toxicant-induced imprinting dysregulation by the two models remain poorly understood. Using an
established Pb exposure mouse model, this study seeks to determine in utero mechanisms that impact
genomic imprinting and health effects from altered epigenetic reprogramming. Thus, female animals exposed
to Pb two weeks prior to mating through 13-14 days post-conception will be used in the following Aims: 1)
Determine fetal sex-specific imprinting dysregulation associated with in utero Pb exposure in mouse placenta,
2) Assess allele- and sex-specific mechanisms of in utero Pb exposure regulating genomic imprinting in the
brain. Pb-exposed animals will be compared against controls to investigate genomic imprinting mechanisms in
the lncRNA and insulator models by characterizing sex-, tissue-, and developmental stage-specific imprinted
gene dysregulation via phenotypic, gene expression, DNA methylation, and immunohistochemical analyses.
This study will reveal Pb-associated lncRNA mechanisms that inform the current epigenetic reprogramming by
fetal sex. The University of Michigan provides an ideal environment to conduct the proposed research in
collaboration with multiple core facilities outlined herein. The candidate will receive mentorship from a
multidisciplinary team of experts to: 1) Gain proficiency in computational and statistical skills required for data
analysis; 2) Acquire expertise in developmental toxicological research and mechanistic investigation; and 3)
Build skills critical for leadership, teaching and mentoring, laboratory management, and grantsmanship. The
proposed study will address fundamental knowledge gaps of genomic imprinting in the field to inform potential
Pb-induced disease interventions. The training and research goals established in this K01 proposal constitute
an exceptional foundation to ensure the candidate success in obtaining research independence."
10807050,"Disengagement from services is a major public health problem for individuals with first-episode psychosis
(FEP) as up to 40% of individuals prematurely terminate early care. Individuals with FEP are consequently at
increased risk of persistent symptomatic and functional impairment and poor long-term outcomes. Engagement
can be improved by (1) identifying pragmatic and effective evidence-based interventions, (2) pinpointing the
mechanisms through which change in engagement is achieved, and (3) enhancing the literature on
engagement, such as by developing a nuanced and dynamic conceptualization of engagement to guide future
research. In the U.S., effective interventions for engagement are particularly needed for community mental
health services, which deliver most mental health care and encounter major engagement issues, and for hard-
to-reach communities, such as those comprised by Latinos. Research conducted with individuals with
psychosis has shown that Behavioral Activation (BA), designed for the treatment of depression, may effectively
target engagement and also symptomatic and functional outcomes. This study will develop 12-session BA for
FEP and compare it to treatment-as-usual over six months with a sample of 58 (29 per condition) Latinos and
their family caregivers in a longitudinal randomized controlled trial. Dyads will also participate in comparable
family support groups delivered separately by condition. To examine mechanisms of change, the association
between intervention mediators and engagement will be examined to determine whether changes in mediators
precede changes in engagement over time. Using mixed-methods, the relationship between local/cultural
factors and engagement will be explored. Qualitative methods will be used to explore how local/cultural factors
impact engagement for future quantitative analysis, how specific characteristics of robust predictors (e.g.,
family support) influence engagement, discover other critical influences, consider BA specific factors, and
generate a model of engagement in FEP care with attention to stages of development, illness, and treatment.
The project provides training in service engagement and intervention for FEP, developing and applying BA for
FEP, addressing engagement during FEP in hard-to-reach communities with cultural responsivity, and relevant
research methods with primary mentor, Alex Kopelowicz, M.D, co-mentors Steven R. Lopez, Ph.D., Lisa B.
Dixon, M.D., M.P.H., and Sona Dimidjian, Ph.D., and consultants Hilary Mairs, Ph.D., Anahi Collado, Ph.D.,
Mark Lai, Ph.D., Jodie Ullman, Ph.D., Lawrence Palinkas, Ph.D., and Ethel Nicdao, Ph.D. Activities will be
sustained through regular communication with and between trainers and resources at California State
University San Bernardino, University of Southern California, and relevant institutions/sites. Training supports
Dr. Santos’s long-term goal of advancing the field of service engagement for persons with FEP from hard-to-
reach communities. The project will enhance the FEP engagement and intervention field and supports the
NIMH’s goals of improving engagement and maximizing recovery for persons with early psychotic illness."
10807053,"Lysosomal function of progranulin and neurodegeneration
Mutations in the granulin (GRN) gene, resulting in haploinsufficiency of the progranulin (PGRN) protein, are a
main cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). PGRN is comprised of 7.5 granulin repeats and
processed into individual granulin peptides in the lysosome. PGRN and granulin peptides are critical for proper
lysosome activities and regulate many microglia mediated functions. However, how granulin peptides function
in the lysosome is still unknown. Using our newly generated antibodies against individual granulins, we have
shown that levels of individual granulin peptides can be differentially regulated. One granulin peptide, granulin
E, interacts with CD68, a lysosomal membrane protein highly expressed in microglia. We have found that loss
of CD68 specifically affects the levels of granulin E but no other granulins and PGRN deficiency leads to
changes in CD68 levels and molecular weight, indicating that granulin E and CD68 regulate each other’s
homeostasis in the lysosome. We have also discovered that PGRN interacts with alpha-N-
acetylgalactosaminidase (NAGA), a lysosomal glycosidase, via the granulin F domain, and regulates NAGA
activities. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that individual granulin peptides have unique
properties and functions in the lysosome through binding to specific lysosome protein(s). Three specific aims
are proposed to further dissect the properties and function of granulin peptides in the lysosome. In Aim1, we
will determine the processing and stability of individual granulin peptides, by measuring the levels and half-
lives of individual granulins vs full length PGRN in neurons vs microglia, the two main cell types that express
PGRN in the brain. Changes in the levels of individual granulins will be assayed during aging and
neurodegeneration. The mechanism by which CD68 regulates the levels of granulin E will be elucidated. In
Aim2, we will dissect the functions of individual granulins in the lysosome. The mechanisms by which granulin
peptides E and F regulate CD68 and NAGA functions will be investigated, respectively. Binding partners for
other granulin peptides will be identified through proteomic screens and characterized. In Aim 3, we will
investigate the role of granulins in maintaining lysosomal membrane integrity and the transcriptional program
involved in microglial activation upon PGRN loss, since we have found that PGRN deficiency leads to impaired
lysosomal membrane integrity and enhanced expression of lysosomal proteins and inflammation markers in
microglia. The proposed studies will shed light on the physiological functions of granulin peptides in the
lysosome and the connection between lysosomal dysfunction and microglial activation. Our work will also
facilitate therapeutic development for FTLD and other devastating neurodegenerative diseases."
10807054,"ABSTRACT
 The physiology of glucose metabolism is intricately linked to the process of digestion. Sensory and
gastrointestinal cues trigger and enhance insulin secretion from the endocrine pancreas even before the serum
glucose levels rise, thus priming the system for the upcoming glucose intake. Not surprisingly, most effective
modern therapeutic approaches for the diabetes treatment are shifting from being pancreas-centric to being gut-
centric and include surgical options (various types of bariatric surgeries), as well as pharmacological targeting
of glucoregulatory signals from the gut (incretin therapies). Yet, the full complexity of how the gut regulates
pancreatic responses is not fully understood. While most research has focused on the endocrine signals from
the gut to the pancreas, little is known about direct neuronal links between the two organs. Such a neuronal link
has been described in anatomical studies and is termed entero-pancreatic plexus. Despite this anatomical
connection, the physiological role of this plexus remains almost entirely unaddressed. The long-term goal of
this research project is to understand the contribution of the entero-pancreatic neuronal plexus to the regulation
of pancreatic islet function. The objective of this application is to identify and characterize the molecular and
functional features of the entero-pancreatic neuronal network and its effect on the function of the endocrine
pancreas. Our preliminary data support the existence of the entero-pancreatic neuronal plexus and demonstrate
that luminal infusion of carbohydrates into the gut triggers activation of pancreatic neurons within seconds. I
therefore hypothesize that activation of entero-pancreatic neuronal plexus by luminal nutrients stimulates insulin
secretion from the pancreatic beta cells via cholinergic signaling mechanisms. I propose that manipulation of the
gut-pancreas axis holds a therapeutic potential for the treatment or management of the metabolic diseases and
introduces a new dimension for understanding of the gut-pancreas interaction and incretin signaling. I will test
my hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims. Aim 1 will identify the molecular expression profile of enteric
neurons that project to the pancreas using single nuclei RNA sequencing of traced neurons and determine the
histological topography and connectivity of these neurons using immunohistochemistry and in-situ
hybridization. Aim 2 will investigate entero-pancreatic connection physiologically using in-vivo Ca2+imaging and
fluorescent tracking of insulin secretion in exteriorized pancreas, combined with pharmacogenetic and surgical
manipulation of neuronal pathways. The findings of this proposal will bring into light neural gut-pancreas axis,
which has a far-reaching impact on the fields of gastroenterology and endocrinology."

 This is an application for a K08 award for Dr. Shah Ali, MD, an Instructor in Cardiology at the University
of Texas Southwestern (UTSW), for his transition from Instructor to independent investigator in basic
cardiovascular biology with a focus on cardiac regeneration. He has completed residency training in Internal
Medicine at the University of California San Francisco and fellowship training in Cardiology at UTSW.
 The research in this proposal will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Hesham Sadek, a leading expert
in the field of cardiac regeneration and an ideal mentor with significant training experience. In addition, an
Advisory Committee that includes Dr. Eric Olson, a renowned expert in cardiac developmental biology, will
provide biannual constructive criticism of data, hypotheses, and proposed experiments in a written manner as
well as career guidance and development.
 The proposal described herein will investigate the molecular mechanisms of neonatal heart regeneration
in mice with an aim at translating these findings to humans to generate novel therapies to treat heart diseases.
Although the mammalian heart is known to be a mostly quiescent organ whose primary parenchymal cell – the
cardiomyocyte – is cell cycle-arrested in adults, recent pioneering studies from the laboratory of Dr. Sadek have
characterized a phenomenon of complete cardiac regeneration in neonatal mice. After resection of the ventricular
apex or surgically-induced myocardial infarction (MI), mice younger than one week of age exhibit complete
cardiomyocyte renewal, in stark contrast to adult mice that develop a fibrotic scar due to failure to achieve
meaningful cardiomyogenesis. A fate-mapping approach showed that existing cardiomyocytes divide to generate
new cardiomyocytes after neonatal injuries.
 Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that there are cardiotropic factors within the young mouse
heart that elicit the robust cardiomyocyte proliferation after neonatal MI. Our preliminary data identifies insulin-
like growth factor binding protein, IGFBP3, as a cardiomyocyte mitogen that enables cardiomyocyte division.
Intriguingly, this factor is not expressed in the heart in the absence of injury or during development, suggesting
that it is part of a specific injury-induced signaling pathway. The specific aims propose to: 1) identify and
characterize the cell that secretes IGFBP3 in response to injury, 2) determine whether IGFBP3 is necessary for
neonatal regeneration and/or sufficient to promote cardiomyocyte renewal after adult MI, and 3) determine
whether IGFBP3 utilizes IGF signaling to stimulate cardiomyocyte division.
 Ultimately, the training and research plan outlined here will support Dr. Ali as he achieves independence
as a physician-scientist-cardiologist. As an independent PI, Dr. Ali will study the mechanisms that mediate
neonatal heart regeneration to inform the development of novel therapeutics for adult heart disease, a logical
extension of his K08 proposal."
10808606,"Project Summary/Abstract: Maternal hypercholesterolemia (MHC) is a pathological condition of exaggerated
maternal serum cholesterol during gestation. Although there is a normal rise in maternal cholesterol during
pregnancy which is vital for early organ development, an excessive increase can manifest in women with
elevated cholesterol prior to conception. Further, pregnancy conditions such as maternal obesity, gestational
diabetes, and preeclampsia are associated with overt hypercholesterolemia.
 MHC is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e., pre-term delivery and low birth weight) and
a range of metabolic complications in offspring including increased adiposity, fetal fatty streaks that develop
faster in childhood, and the programming of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Alarmingly, as the use
of lipid-lowering medication in MHC is contraindicated due to fears around fetal toxicity, there are limited
acceptable treatment options and an acknowledged increase in disease risk for offspring from hyper-
cholesterolemic mothers before they are even born.
 This proposal addresses two critical knowledge gaps for MHC: (i) the scarcity of information on how
excessive early cholesterol exposure impacts the offspring’s hepatic epigenome and how these modifications
may influence NAFLD progression; and (ii) an alarming lack of cholesterol-lowering treatment options for use
during MHC. As safe and effective plant-based cholesterol-lowering agents, phytosterols (PS) and their
saturated derivatives, phytostanols (PSA) are highly suitable candidates.
 Using a diet-induced hypercholesterolemic C57BL/6J mouse model, this proposal seeks to identify the
hepatic epigenomic adaptations to excessive early-life cholesterol exposure and the influence of
maternal cholesterol-lowering strategies on the molecular and metabolic features of NAFLD in
offspring. Employing methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, these studies will examine how MHC
throughout pregnancy alters the DNA methylation pattern of hepatic lipid-regulatory genes in early life and
determine the persistence of these molecular adaptations into adulthood. Further, we will directly compare the
efficacy of maternal PS versus PSA intervention as strategies to limit fetal exposure to excessive cholesterol
and protect against the programming of NAFLD in offspring.
 This proposal addresses the critical question of how to make pregnancies safer for
hypercholesterolemic mothers and their children. The novel ideas presented in this proposal directly reflect the
research priorities of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) with particular
respect to the Pediatric Growth and Nutrition Branch that seeks to ‘understand the mechanisms of growth
and development at the gene-molecular level’ and ‘identify the molecular drivers that transmit the memory of
adverse intrauterine environments into adolescence and adulthood’."

 This is an application for a K23 award for Ana Monteiro, MD, PhD, a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician at
the University of California Los Angeles. The goal of this proposal is for Dr. Monteiro to establish herself as a young
investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on vascular injury
as a contributor to pulmonary physiologic dysfunction and worse outcomes in ARDS. This K23 award will provide Dr.
Monteiro with the support necessary to: 1) study the biologic endotype of ARDS involving vascular injury, pulmonary
physiologic dysfunction and worsening mortality; 2) determine the feasibility and utility of measuring peripheral blood
markers to determine pulmonary disease severity; 3) become an expert in analysis of large datasets of both clinical and
transcriptomic nature; 4) become proficient in the use of bulk and single cell transcriptomic analysis; 5) become an expert
clinical and translational researcher in ARDS; and 6) develop an independent translational research career. Dr.
Monteiro’s plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary
mentors, Drs. Michael Matthay and Anil Sapru, have extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the
career development of early-stage investigators. Dr. Monteiro will also work with Dr. Matteo Pellegrini, a bioinformatics
expert and world leader on the science of bulk and single cell transcriptomics, Dr. John Belperio, an expert in post-
transplant primary graft dysfunction with extensive experience with biospecimen handling and biobanking and a
recognized pulmonary educator, Dr. Steve Dubinett, a world class clinical and translational researcher of cancer
immunology, and Sitaram Vangala, the Director of the Medicine Biostatistics core and an expert in causal inference.
 ARDS is characterized by an increased inflammatory response that induces epithelial and vascular damage and
respiratory failure. This proposal will investigate the causal pathways connecting vascular injury to respiratory failure by
utilizing previously collected data and plasma samples from the completed ROSE-PETAL network trial and the ongoing
observational cohort study (LOBAR) that will prospectively collect biospecimens, mechanical ventilation data, and
clinical outcomes. This proposal represents an innovative approach by addressing the feasibility and utility of evaluating
proteomic, transcriptomic and cell-level blood markers including circulating endothelial cells in identifying novel
pathological pathways and determine pulmonary disease severity. The Specific Aims are: 1) Test whether local or
systemic markers of endothelial injury best predict lung dysfunction and mortality in ARDS; 2) Leverage bulk RNA
sequencing of blood to characterize and quantify endothelial damage in ARDS; and 3) An exploratory aim to characterize
biological derangement of CECs in ARDS using cell-level transcriptomic analysis. Addressing these gaps in knowledge
may promote non-invasive analytic techniques for future ARDS studies and reveal novel pathways in ARDS pathogenesis
for therapeutic targeting. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal
designed to study interventions tailored to patients with a vascular injury predominant endotype of ARDS."

An increasing number of youth involved in the legal system (YILS) use cannabis, which can lead to cannabis
use disorder and associated legal, social, and educational impairment. Prevention of cannabis use disorder
among YILS is rare and there are many barriers to successful implementation. Mobile health technology holds
promise to identify ecological vulnerabilities for cannabis use among YILS and to intervene in their natural
environment. Ecological Momentary Assessment/Intervention (EMA/EMI) have been effectively used with other
populations to measure substance use and intervene in the natural environment. Additionally, individualized
constellations of antecedents to substance use derived from EMA data have accurately predicted prospective
use, suggesting that targeted, individualized EMI is a promising approach to prevent cannabis use disorder.
The purpose of this mixed-methods K23 study is to 1) assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of using
EMA to measure ecological antecedents to cannabis use, 2) co-develop and pilot test an EMI to deliver
Personalized Feedback content to reduce cannabis use and prevent progression to cannabis use disorder
among YILS, and then 3) evaluate the EMI’s preliminary efficacy to prevent cannabis use disorder among YILS
who have initiated use. The overall goal of this application is to provide protected, mentored time to expand Dr.
Evan Holloway’s (PI) capacity to become an independent health services researcher with expertise at the
intersection of digital health, cannabis use, and health services interventions for YILS. Dr. Holloway will work
with a team of experienced and knowledgeable mentors (Drs. Tolou-Shams, Borsari, Ling, Rizzo, & Santos) to
develop expertise in EMA/EMI, cannabis use, secondary prevention of substance use, Personalized Feedback,
and mobile health technologies, with youth involved in the legal system to support his achievement of these
research and career goals. The proposed research study is a logical extension of Dr. Holloway’s program of
research to date, which has focused on the complex interplay between behavioral health service delivery
systems, individual, peer, family, and environmental influences on behavioral health and legal outcomes for
YILS. This early career development award will provide the necessary candidate training and foundation for a
larger R01 hybrid design clinical trial testing the efficacy of the mHealth EMI designed and tested during the
K23, propelling a federally-funded program of research designed to prevent cannabis use disorder for YILS."
10808244,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Invasive aspergillosis is one of the most common fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. With
the increasing number of susceptible patients and the threat of antifungal-resistance, the development of host-
centric interventions is of paramount importance. Complement, a potent component of the innate immune
system, is protective against many infections. On the other hand, complement overactivation has been shown
to drive lung injury and inflammation. Pulmonary hemorrhage is a characteristic feature of invasive aspergillosis,
and the interactions between pulmonary hemorrhage and complement activation are poorly understood.
Intervening in the interactions between hemorrhage and complement may prove beneficial as a novel therapeutic
intervention to manage pulmonary aspergillosis, and a number of complement inhibitors are either FDA-
approved or in late-phase development.
 The overarching hypothesis in this project is that pulmonary hemorrhage in invasive aspergillosis
leads to complement overactivation, leading to tissue injury and further hemorrhage. The dynamics of
complement activation are complex and span multiple sites, making it difficult to predict how and when to
intervene. We propose that mathematical modeling-based design of effective therapies in pulmonary
aspergillosis can help in the discovery phase of understanding mechanisms of complement-mediated injury in
pulmonary aspergillosis, and possible interventions of such mechanisms. As such we will leverage the power of
mathematical modeling, closely coupled with in vivo models of pulmonary aspergillosis, to unravel the
interactions of hemorrhage and complement in the lung and to systematically interrogate the model to determine
possible points of intervention. In Aim 1, we will mechanistically explore the effects of the terminal component of
the complement cascade in pulmonary aspergillosis. In Aim 2, we will build a multiscale mathematical model of
pulmonary aspergillosis to capture the mechanisms that connect hemorrhage and complement activity, validating
these mechanisms in vivo. We will then use the model to derive a prioritized set of interventions that will be
validated in mouse models of pulmonary aspergillosis.
 This research is intended to train a PhD mathematician with a background in mathematical modeling in
experimental biology and facilitate his transition to an independent investigator. He will be mentored by a
physician-scientist with expertise in lung host defense and a complement biologist and overseen by an advisory
committee composed of experts in computational modeling, lung biology, and mycology. This training will be
enhanced by the rich scientific environment at the University of Florida, together with rigorous coursework in
advanced immunology, mycology, and microbiology, and training in grant writing and scientific rigor. Taken
together, this project will train a transdisciplinary scientist for an independent investigative career."
10798102,"Primary brain tumors in adults represent a heterogeneous and often fatal group of tumors. Current treatment of primary brain tumors heavily relies on surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy and is associated with cognitive impairment and other toxicities. Unlike in many other human cancers, inhibitors of oncogenic kinases have shown inconsistent clinical activity in brain tumor patients and it remains unclear which genetic alterations are critical for tumor maintenance in specific brain tumor types. The goal of this research program is to establish therapeutic strategies that exploit the most common genetic alterations is three specific tumor types, namely mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in low grade glioma, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) in Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL), and EGFR in glioblastoma (GBM). Our research program incorporates the evaluation of tumor biopsies from patients being treated with inhibitors of these pathways, genetic and pharmacological studies in newly-derived experimental brain tumor models, and the development of state-of-the art approaches to quantify intratumoral heterogeneity in cancer signaling and tumor evolution. We believe that our research program will narrow the current knowledge gap regarding oncogene “addiction” in primary brain tumors and provide a framework for mechanism-based combination therapies targeting these signaling nodes and other signaling pathways."
10820519,"Project Summary – Metabolism and Metabolomics Core
The purpose of the Metabolism and Metabolomics Core is to encourage and facilitate use of targeted and
untargeted analytical methods for nutritional epidemiological and intervention studies, to provide access to
state-of-the-art techniques and equipment to bench scientists, and to provide cost-effective assays for
investigators without lab facilities. The Core was established in 1999 under the leadership of Dr. Steven Zeisel.
Dr. Susan Sumner joined UNC in 2017 and took on the leadership of the Core. The Core specializes in using
state-of-the-art metabolomics and exposome technologies to determine how molecules that are present in
cells, tissues, and biological fluids are associated with weight status, nutrient status, and states of health and
wellness. The measurement of perturbations in metabolism that arise from disease, dysfunction, or exposure
(e.g., chemicals, drugs, nutrients, foods, stress) is referred to as metabolomics. The measurement of all
exposures and the impact on endogenous metabolism is referred to as the exposome. Metabolomics is an
ideal approach to assess the impact of nutrition and diet on health because individuals have different nutrient
requirements and individuals respond differently to nutrient intake and diet and exercise interventions. The
Core also provides metals assays and quantitative targeted analysis of metabolites involved in one carbon
metabolism for nutrition and obesity studies. The Core’s services are unique and do not overlap with the North
Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute (NC TraCS) or other UNC core services. The Core offers
services and equipment at both the Chapel Hill campus and the UNC Nutrition Research Institute campus (two
hours from Chapel Hill in Kannapolis, NC) to make use of unique equipment and to broaden access to services
for both UNC NORC members and external users."
10812402,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We currently have an unprecedented ability to profile the genetic- and pathway-level changes that occur in cancer. Yet, clinicians lack the diverse arsenal of drugs needed to treat subpopulations of patients more effectively, reduce side effects and offer second-line treatment when drug resistance emerges. There is a pressing need to dramatically increase the repertoire of drugs available to fight cancer.
Advances in automated microscopy and computer vision, allow the widespread use of phenotypic profiling in early drug discovery. In this grant, we address two challenges. First, the power of phenotypic profiling has led to a growing number of large, disparate image datasets. In aim 1, we will develop machine-learning approaches that combine disparate datasets to obtain accurate predictions of uncharacterized compound function. Second, phenotypic screens can identify candidate compounds across multiple, diverse pathways, but often only use a single cancer cell line. In aim 2, we will develop strategies to identify minimal collections of cell lines that maximize detection of small molecule activities.
Successful execution will: increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing existing phenotypic screening datasets and providing a rational approach for selecting cell lines that maximize the chance of discovering hits in desired pathways."

We have recently discovered macrophage ED2/CD163 gene overexpression as a novel and safe pain
therapeutic target in the local peripheral immune system in a major surgery rat model. We propose to develop a
cell-directed gene therapy that would correct the underlying local immunological cause of pain resulting from
inflammatory processes, specifically in sub-chronic postoperative pain or inflammatory conditions. Through
unbiased genome-wide transcriptomic analyses in human primary macrophages we identified that ED2/CD163
gene induction modulates tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) and interleukin (IL)-1 beta (IL-1b). CD163
overexpression using a clinically tested nanoparticle designed to target macrophages promoted a more rapid
wound healing in 3D human organotypic skin tissues and prevented sub-chronic postoperative pain behaviors
and reduced local TNFa and IL-1b in rats with skin-muscle incision and retraction (SMIR) surgery. We
hypothesize that ED2/CD163 in macrophages is a safe target for the treatment of inflammatory pain with
opioid sparing effects. We propose a multidimensional research plan including, 1) a sub-chronic surgical pain
model, the SMIR surgery, and a knee inflammatory mode, the Complete Freund Adjuvant (CFA)-induced knee
arthritis; 2) ED2/CD163 gain and loss of function using macrophage-directed nanotechnology; 3) novel, clinically
relevant, and complex operant pain-related behaviors; 4) cellular/molecular, tissue, and transcriptomic outcomes
for mechanistic target engagement; and 5) studies for ED2/CD163’s effects on opioid requirements. We will
implement our plan through these specific aims: 1) Determine that macrophage specific ED2/CD163 gene
induction effectively promotes resolution of inflammatory pain. A mannosilated polyethyleneimine
nanoparticles (Man-PEI) designed to deliver nucleic acids specifically to macrophages will be used to conduct
ED2/CD163 gain (overexpression) or loss (knock down) of function. We will assess classic behaviors (von Frey
and weight bearing), and novel complex and clinically relevant functional activity and attention-related behaviors
developed and validated by our team. 2) Define ED2/CD163 target engagement, i.e. ED2/CD163 as a
signaling driver that dictates the dynamics of macrophage phenotype change and cellular reprogramming
in inflammatory pain. TNFa and IL-1b will be measured as downstream target engagement. Also, we will use
single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq), cluster, and phenotype trajectory analysis to define how ED2/CD163 impacts
gene expression programs in macrophages infiltrating the inflamed tissue. 3) Establish that macrophage
ED2/CD163 gene induction results in opioid-sparing effects in surgical and inflammatory pain. We will
construct dose responses of morphin in rats with SMIR or arthritis and ED2/CD163 overexpression to measure
opioid-sparing effects. Our project will establish ED2/CD163 as a cell-directed gene therapy for postsurgical pain
that will reduce opioid requirements and disinter how it influences immune responses and inflammatory pain
recovery. Our multidisciplinary team is uniquely equipped to successfully complete these studies."
10813867,"Abstract. There is an urgent need to expand the number of underrepresented minorities in STEM with the goal
of increasing diversity in the field, thereby strengthening the country's capacity for research and innovation and
filling gaps in the workforce. Hampton University is the ideal institution to continue leading this initiative as we
have a long record of accomplishment of producing highly qualified STEM professionals. Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) such as ours have been very successful in fostering Baccalaureate degree
attainment in general, while also fostering the attainment of advanced degrees. The Hampton MARC Program
made impressive strides in achieving its stated goals to prepare Hampton graduates to be leaders in biomedical
research by improving their preparation for PhD programs as well as future research careers. The Program
completed the training of 12 MARC Scholars all of whom graduated within 4 years and entered into doctoral or
PREP programs. Beyond the direct impact on the MARC Scholars, the MARC program has positively affected
more than 400 non-MARC/ non pre-MARC Hampton students who majored or did not major in Biomedical
sciences. Building on the MARC program at Hampton, the proposed U-RISE program will focus its effort of the
following three (3) aims: 1) To increase the number of students from Hampton pursuing and matriculating in PhD
or MD/PhD programs in biomedical sciences; 2) To implement a pre-U-RISE curriculum designed to: a) increase
the number of students interested in research careers; b) improve STEM retention rates; and c) increase the
number of students eligible for U-RISE by improving academic performance and achievement; and 3) To
implement effective mentoring and enhanced opportunities for pre-U-RISE and U-RISE Scholars through formal
mentor training and engagement of U-RISE faculty in program activities. Overall, the proposed curriculum and
activities will continue to enhance students’ skills and prepare U-RISE Scholars, Affiliates, and other highly
motivated Hampton students for entry into top-ranked biomedical PhD or MD/PhD programs. Collectively, the U-
RISE Program activities will enhance competitiveness during graduate studies and continue to increase the
likelihood of Hampton students graduating from prestigious graduate programs, pursuing research careers and
receiving NIH funding. In addition, the proposed program improves mentoring capacity at Hampton."

This project will generate extensive new findings about cortical organization and connectivity in
humans and nonhuman primates using high quality, multimodal datasets provided by our
collaborators and by the young adult Human Connectome Project (YA-HCP). It will accelerate
progress by freely sharing the resulting tools and experimental data with the scientific
community. The first aim will provide a critically needed evaluation of non-invasive connectivity
measures in relation to invasive anatomical tracers in macaque monkeys. Different methods for
estimating fMRI-derived functional connectivity will be evaluated in order to determine which
approach best correlates with `ground truth' tracer-based anatomical connectivity. This aim will
also generate new insights about cortical evolution by comparing areal organization across
humans, macaques, and marmosets using a novel approach in which areal features (myelin
maps, resting-state networks, and identified homologous areas) constrain the registration
between species. The second aim will focus on cortical organization in individual subjects using
refined HCP-style analysis tools. It will optimize and evaluate intersubject alignment (using a
recently developed Multimodal Surface Matching method) and individual-subject parcellation
(using a machine learning based areal classifier). An important outcome will be
recommendations of `best practice' for other projects that acquire less fMRI data than in the YA-
HCP. These data will also be used to characterize individual variability of human cortical areas.
For each of 180 areas, individual differences in size and topology (neighborhood relationships)
will be examined for heritability and for symmetry across the two hemispheres. Additional
analyses will reveal whether some areas are reproducibly absent in some individuals and
whether `novel' areas are present in some subjects. The third aim is to enhance the capabilities
of the Connectome Workbench visualization and analysis platform and the BALSA database
that were introduced during previous grant periods. Enhancements to Connectome Workbench
will: (i) enable non-invasive electrophysiological (MEG/EEG) and invasive neurophysiological
data to be integrated with MRI data and atlas-based connectivity data (ii) facilitate
interoperability across different atlases, (iii) improve interactive `HCP-style' analysis capabilities,
and (iv) enable cortical layer-based analyses. Enhancements to the BALSA database include:
(i) a WebGL-based web-viewer for interactive online visualization with special focus on the
unique data generated by this project, (ii) an online spatial localization tool and (iii) support for
uploading scene files to BALSA from 5 other software platforms besides Workbench."

Dry eye disease (DED) is a complex, multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of tear
film homeostasis, with symptoms including ocular discomfort and visual disturbance. DED is one of the major
reasons for visits to optometry and ophthalmology clinics in U.S., with a higher apparent incidence and
prevalence in females and the elderly. With its negative impact on quality of life, DED is a major public health
concern. Despite the gravity of DED, current treatments are limited. This strongly suggests that new targets
with novel mechanisms of action are needed. Recent studies have uncovered the role of ocular sensory
neurons in ocular physiology and the etiology of DED, especially highlighting the role of the cold and
menthol receptor, TRPM8, in ocular pain as well as basal tear flow and hydration of the ocular surface. TRPM8
is a valid target for the treatment of DED, but the complex conformational landscape of TRPM8 has hampered
drug development. Our primary objectives are to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism by
which TRPM8 is gated by ligands and to design and develop novel TRPM8-modulating compounds using
structural biology, chemical biology, medicinal chemistry, in vitro and ex vivo electrophysiology, imaging, and
animal model studies. Taken together, successful completion of this work will provide the framework for
TRPM8-targeted therapeutic development as well as reveal the molecular basis for ligand gating of TRPM8 –
with far-reaching implications in treating ocular disorders."

Sleep and metabolic disorders are often comorbid, but how they interact is poorly understood. The salt
inducible kinase SIK3 was identified (first in C. elegans and 8 years later in flies and mice) as a sleep drive
regulator. Our findings suggest that SIKs connect sleep and metabolic regulation. In the prior funding cycle, we
demonstrated hierarchical somatic/neural interactions regulating both sleep and energy homeostasis. We have
shown that the sleep and energy-regulating roles of KIN-29/SIK occur by inhibiting the class 2 histone
deacetylase HDA-4 (HDAC4) in 12 pairs of glutamatergic neurons. Illuminating the mechanism by which KIN-
29 signals in glutamatergic neurons during high sleep drive will be the goal of aim 1. We will study the role of
CREB and CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) in glutamatergic neurons. In aim 2, we will
test the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species promote sleep. In aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that NAD+
precursors promote sleep and are reduced in kin-29 mutants. Finally, in aim 4, we will identify genes whose
expression is regulated by the KIN-29--|HDA-4 signaling module. Such genes will be candidates for mediating
sleep-promoting signaling by glutamatergic neurons. At the completion of these aims, we will have an
improved understanding of the genetic and metabolic regulation of sleep. Data collected in aim 4 will motivate
additional genetic hypotheses that will be tested in future research."
10800989,"The prevalence of smoking habits is much higher in US veterans (21.6%) than that in the general
population (13.7%). Individuals who smoke are more susceptible to influenza virus infection (Flu),
which often progresses to severe acute lung injury (ALI), results in high morbidity and mortality
than nonsmokers. However, the immune mechanisms by which cigarette smoke (CS) enhances
Flu severity need to be better defined, and thus effective therapies are limited. To investigate this,
we have established a two-hit model of 4-week CS exposure and subsequent intranasal influenza
A virus (IAV)-infection (CS+Flu). In this model, by using intravital (in vivo) multi-photon-excitation
fluorescence microscopy, for the first time, we observe that prior CS exposure induces
hyperactivation of innate immune responses against Flu as evidenced by a significant increase in
platelet-rich neutrophil-platelet aggregates (NPAs) and circulating neutrophil extracellular traps
(NETs), leading to more profound weight loss and severe ALI relative to Flu alone. Our preliminary
findings revealed that two-hit (CS+Flu) induces “platelet-rich” NPA formation and uniquely
upregulates TLR7 (toll-like receptor 7, a sensor of single-stranded RNA of IAV) and caspase-11
(the effector of non-canonical inflammasome pathway) in circulating platelets of mice. Further,
circulating neutrophils isolated from mice exposed to CS+Flu uniquely expressed the active forms
of both caspase-11 and gastermin-D (GSDMD-NT), an executor of pyroptosis. Additionally,
coagulation (tissue factor [TF] expression and fibrin deposition) was increased in the lung of
CS+Flu relative to RA+Flu mice. These findings form the basis for our overarching hypothesis
that prior CS exposure exacerbates Flu-induced ALI through pulmonary microvascular occlusion
by platelet caspase-11 mediated platelet-rich NPAs, leading to GSDMD-mediated NETs
generation, followed by fibrin deposition in the lung. This proposed study will be the first to
introduce a novel paradigm that occlusion of lung microvasculature by platelet-rich NPAs
promotes CS-induced Flu severity and potentially identify a new therapeutic target – platelet-
neutrophil caspase signaling to promote Flu-induced thrombo-inflammation and severe ALI."
10802164,"The human gastrointestinal tract houses a complex gut microbiota, or microbiome that is tightly linked with numerous inflammatory and metabolic diseases. The gut microbiota influences local and systemic immune responses, chronic low-grade inflammation, and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity-related insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Diet is a key modulator of gut microbiota metabolism, composition, and functional capacity as well as human health. Despite recent progress, still relatively little is known about the mechanisms that connect specific diets and molecules within diet to the microbiota and human health. Fermented foods have been recently shown to increase human gut microbiota diversity and decrease markers of inflammation, and preliminary data within this application show that fermented vegetable brine (FVB), filter sterilized FVB (sFVB) and lactate (a major metabolite within sFVB) can induce regulatory T cells (Tregs) in mice. This application is focused on investigating molecules within fermented vegetable brine, with a focus on lactate, that are capable of modulating aspects of host biology relevant allergy and inflammation and understanding how cues from gut microbes impact these interactions. The goals of this application include (i) defining the mechanisms by which fermented foods vegetable brine facilitate the engraftment of new strains to increase microbiota diversity, (ii) characterizing the requirement of gut microbes in lactate induced Treg expansion, (iii) determining the host perception pathways that are responsible for lactate-induced Treg expansion in a mouse model. Aim 1 will determine how microbiota diversity acquisition, a feature of gut microbiomes linked to health, is promoted by fermented foods. This aim will reveal to what extent diversity increase is intrinsic to a microbiota versus requires exogenous microbes. Aim 2 will investigate the dependence of lactate induced Treg expansion on components of the gut microbiota. Experiments will identify how specific gut resident microbes impact Treg expansion in the presence of oral lactate and what molecular cues are required for Treg expansion. Aim 3 will employ mice genetically lacking lactate-binding G-protein coupled receptors to establish the basis of lactate perception. This project will advance our understanding of how fermented foods and metabolites within these foods impact the microbiota and host biology for improved health."
10802177,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project is aimed at understanding the processes that drive decline in cognitive function with aging. Over the
past decade it has become increasingly clear that many normal individuals often harbor the pathology that is
associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD): β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and pathological accumulation of the
microtubule associated protein tau. With the ability to detect and track these pathologies during life using multiple
techniques including positron emission tomography (PET), we have learned that Aβ and tau pathology are
associated with, and can predict decline in cognition, particularly episodic memory (EM), in otherwise cognitively
normal people. Nevertheless, there is considerable variability associated with how individuals respond to AD
pathology. Some show resilience: that is, they do not display impairment in EM despite evidence of pathology,
while others may demonstrate resistance: they do not show evidence of pathology when existing group level
data predicts its occurrence. The next phase of this project is oriented towards understanding how some people
show successful aging outcomes despite the presence of AD pathology or show lower levels of pathology then
expected. We will begin by defining two groups of successful agers from the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study
(BACS) who have 3 or more longitudinal visits. The first definition makes use of a widely applied approach to
select individuals performing at high levels in cross sectional cognitive measures. We refer to these as
exceptional agers (EA) and will use a novel method deploying machine learning to predict “cognitive age” from
a battery of neuropsychological tests. Those who fall in the “youngest” 20 percent of the cognitive age gap (CAG
– difference between actual and predicted age) are defined as EA. Second, we will use a novel approach to
define successful agers as those who show maintenance of EM performance over time, that is a slope of 0 or
above on an EM composite measured at 3 or more timepoints. All of these individuals will receive longitudinal
neuropsychological testing and PET scanning for AD pathology: Aβ PET with [11C]PIB and tau PET with
[18F]Flortaucipir. At the first visit in this grant phase, participants will have an added PET scan to measure
synaptic density with the ligand [18F]SynVesT1 that binds to the synaptic vesicle 2A protein. Based on extensive
preliminary data, we predict that several different mechanisms underlie successful aging outcomes despite AD
pathology: (1) Thicker mid-cingulate cortex will confer resilience to the effects of tau on EM decline (2) Successful
agers will show less tau pathology and slower rates of Aβ and tau deposition because they are in earlier stages
of Aβ deposition and (3) synaptic density in successful agers will be greater in specific brain regions including
prefrontal cortex and mid-cingulate cortex and this will also confer resilience to AD pathology."

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective
accumulation of α-synuclein in glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) within oligodendrocytes. Clinically, MSA
patients present with various combinations of parkinsonism, cerebellar dysfunction, and dysautonomia. MSA is
subclassified based on predominance of symptomology, which is associated with the primary site of
neurodegeneration: MSA-P for parkinsonism and striatonigral degeneration or MSA-C for cerebellar features
and olivopontocerebellar atrophy, though most cases involve both systems. The causes of α-synuclein
accumulation within oligodendrocytes and its consequences to oligodendrocyte physiology in MSA are largely
unknown. Likewise, how oligodendrocyte dysfunction causes neuronal death remains obscure. In this
proposal, we will use single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to generate transcriptomes of single cells
from postmortem brain tissue from MSA patients to delineate the cell type specific transcriptional changes
associated with MSA. We will probe striatal, cerebellar, and cortical tissue sets from the same MSA-P or MSA-
C patients. This allows us to capture the changes that occur in the primary site of pathology for each MSA
subtype, striatum for MSA-P and cerebellum for MSA-C, along with the secondary sites, and a minimally
affected brain region (cortex). In Aim 1, we will collect additional MSA cases and generate snRNA-seq profiles
from all tissue sets. These data will be integrated and clustered to identify major cell types and subtypes from
which informatic analysis of differentially-expressed genes will be used to identify regulatory networks and infer
change in function. In Aim 2, we will test whether cells with altered transcriptional profiles identified by snRNA-
seq correspond to the cells with pathological features of MSA or to cells exhibiting dysfunction using
immunohistochemistry and multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization with RNAscope. Initially focusing on
oligodendrocytes, we will determine whether cells bearing GCI exhibit dysregulated transcriptomes, whether α-
synuclein mRNA is overexpressed in these cells, and whether this affects myelin integrity. In Aim 3, we will test
whether forced overexpression of α-synuclein in oligodendrocytes is sufficient to recapitulate the snRNA-seq
profiles obtained from MSA tissues using a nonhuman primate MSA model. Upon completion, this proposal will
generate an atlas of the MSA-dependent transcriptional changes of nearly all cell types in the striatum,
cerebellum, and cortex, identify key alterations in gene expression and the pathways affected, determine
whether α-synuclein expression is increased in cells with GCI, and whether de novo expression of α-synuclein
mRNA fully recapitulates the cell states associated with MSA."

 Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the main identifiable cause of antibiotic assoicated diarreah. in the
US alone, there are close to 500,000 cases annually causing approximately 25,000 deaths and costs the
health care system an estimated $6.3 billion.
 C. difficile spores do not cause disease but can revert to toxin-producing bacteria (a process called
germination) in the microbiota-depleted gut of hospitalized patients. We found that synthetic cholan-24-amides
inhibit C. difficile spore germination and, more importantly, protects rodents from CDI without toxic effects.
 While amide-linked bile salts have many attractive properties, their hydrolysis can release toxic
byproducts. To address this liability, we developed heterobicyclic non-hydrolysable bile salts (NHBS) as anti-
germinants. Importantly, two analogs protect mice from CDI and are stable to the gut microbiome.
 This R01 renewal is based on five foundational discoveries obtained during the last funding period: (I)
Optimized pipeline for CDI prophylactic development, (ii) synthetic bile salt analogs can be uptaked by the
host’s enterohepatic circulation (EHC), (iii) bile salt analogs can be modified by the gut microbiota, Bile salt
side chain integrity and hydroxylation state influence anti-germination activity and/or CDI prophylaxis, and (v)
NHBS analogs are stable towards the gut microbiome, have anti-germination activity against hypervirulent C.
difficile spores, and can protect mice from CDI. Based on the sum of these discoveries, we hypothesize that
the anti-germination and CDI prophylaxis activities of new NHBS analogs can be modulated by the combined
metabolic action of the EHC and the gut microbiota.
 To achieve these goal, we will: (1) Synthesize libraries of NHBS analogs, (2) characterize the
binding sites of anti-germinant binding proteins, (3) determine in vitro efficacy, permeability, stability,
and toxicity of NHBS analogs, (4) assess pharmacokinetic parameters of selected NHBS analogs, and
(5) determine the pharmacodynamics of CDI prophylactics on bile salt homeostasis
 At the start of this project, we will finish characterizing our lead NHBS. This data will provide
benchmarks for new analogs. Our medicinal chemistry efforts will be initially guided by germination
activity, but subsequent identification of NHBS binding sites could aid this effort. As in vitro and in vivo
data is obtained, GO/NO GO criteria will eliminate sub-optimal analogs and inform the rational synthesis
of more potent and stable anti-germinants. This iterative process will be continued until at least one
optimized CDI prophylactic is obtained. As a secondary goal, we will develop CDI prophylactic dosages
that can match the heterogenicity of human CDI risk and variable antibiotic regimes."

The goal of our work is to develop a high-resolution electronic epiretinal implant for treating
incurable blindness from retinal degeneration. To further this goal, we propose here to develop
novel techniques for adaptive, high-resolution, multi-electrode recording and stimulation of
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the isolated macaque and human retina as an experimental lab
prototype for the future device. The major goals of this project are to (1) adaptively use current
steering with electrode triplets to enhance selective targeting of RGCs, (2) adaptively use
spatio-temporal dithering and multiplexing to produce naturalistic activity in large RGC
populations that can support high-quality visual coding, and (3) test the fidelity of electrically
evoked visual signals in RGCs of the central human retina. Tackling these aims will allow us to
emulate the neural code for vision, cell-by-cell and spike-by-spike, over a region of the central
retina. Our unique technical approach involves large-scale, high-resolution electrical recording
and stimulation, combined with novel computational approaches to adjust device function to the
complex circuitry in which it is embedded, including the degenerated retina, and thus to optimize
vision restoration."

10933484,"Project Summary
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is driven by tobacco, ethanol and other carcinogens as well
as oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV). In particular, HPV negative HNSCC has a high rate of mortality and
the main curative treatment options for local and regional disease, including surgery, radiation, and
chemotherapy, incur significant morbidity. PD-1 inhibitors are approved for recurrent/metastatic HNSCC yet have
low response rates of 14-20%. Furthermore, a recent Phase III trial demonstrated no benefit when a PD-1
inhibitor was combined with chemoradiation using large radiation fields targeting tumor and lymph nodes. While
the tumor immune microenvironment is key to the activity of immunotherapy, the role of draining lymph nodes in
the efficacy of immunotherapy is poorly understood and the impact of conventional therapies anti-tumor immunity
deserves further investigation. Our preliminary data demonstrate nodal irradiation or surgical removal of draining
lymph nodes completely blocks the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 inhibitors, and surgical disruption of lymphatic
channels alone while maintaining intact draining lymph nodes also blocks immunotherapy responses.
Mechanistically, we have identified cDC1 and B-cell antigen presenting cells in draining nodes as key immune
effectors coordinating anti-tumor immune responses. Further, a Phase I trial of immunoradiotherapy using PD-1
inhibitors combined with lymphatic sparing stereotactic radiation (SBRT) demonstrates a remarkable 67%
complete pathologic response rate in HNSCC patients. Our central hypothesis is that intact, functional
draining lymphatics and lymph nodes are critical for anti-tumor immunity and that lymphatic preserving
IRT in HNSCC will maximize anti-tumor responses. To explore this hypothesis, we will use animal models of
HPV negative HNSCC to 1) determine the role of the draining sentinel lymph nodes in generating and
coordinating immune responses during immunotherapy and SBRT based immunoradiotherapy in HPV negative
HNSCC, and 2) maximize immunotherapy responses in HNSCC by optimizing treatment sequencing, radiation
targeting, and enhancing antigen presentation in draining lymph nodes. To validate this hypothesis in patients,
we will define immune phenotypes that correlate with major pathologic responses from a clinical trial of
neoadjuvant immunoradiotherapy in HPV negative HNSCC patients. Completion of this project will elucidate the
role of draining sentinel lymph nodes in coordinating anti-tumor immune responses, identify optimized
sequencing and novel combinatorial immune therapies in HNSCC, and define immune signatures in patients
with complete responses to immunoradiotherapy in HSNCC. These insights will guide and improve the design

improve outcomes in HNSCC and other solid tumor patients."

This application, “Optimization of Drug-like Properties of CRFBP-CRF2 Negative Allosteric Modulators for
Alcohol Use Disorder”, is in response to PAR-22-031 “Drug Discovery For Nervous System Disorders (R01
Clinical Trials Not Allowed)”. Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) remains a huge clinical and public health problem with
no effective pharmacological recourse, affecting 28.3 million adults in the United States, and is the 3rd leading
preventable cause of death. The only FDA-approved medications for AUD are disulfiram, naltrexone, and
acamprosate, all of which exhibit limited efficacy and have limiting contraindications. Hence, there is a critical
need to develop more effective therapeutics to treat AUD. While many factors contribute to the development and
maintenance of AUD, increasing attention is being paid to potentially druggable targets within the stress system.
The primary regulator of the stress response, corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), exerts its effects by binding
to CRF1 and CRF2 receptors and, also, a secreted 37-kD CRF-binding protein (CRFBP). In addition, CRFBP
undergoes spontaneous cleavage into a 27-kD N-terminal fragment, CRFBP(27kD), that binds CRF and a 10-
kD C-terminal fragment, CRFBP(10kD), that does not. We hypothesize that CRFBP has dual excitatory and
inhibitory effects on CRF function and, thus, ethanol consumption, and that the CRFBP-CRF2 interaction
represents a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of AUD. To test this hypothesis, we developed
chemical probes specific for the CRFBP(10kD)-CRF2 complex in two lead series that act as negative allosteric
modulators (NAMs) of the CRFBP-CRF2 complex only in the presence of CRFBP(10kD). Our recent structure-
activity relationship (SAR) studies have provided CRFBP-CRF2 NAMs with good on-target potency and
selectivity profiles in vitro, but additional chemical optimization is required to produce chemical probes that are
ready for comprehensive in vivo evaluation. These in vivo probes would allow us to establish the role of CRFBP
in alcohol consumption and facilitate the development of effective treatments targeting CRFBP for AUD. Thus,
our overall objective is to develop systemically active CRFBP-CRF2 NAMs suitable for advanced in vivo proof-
of-concept studies for the treatment of AUD. Accordingly, our Specific Aims are: (1) Design and synthesize novel
CRFBP-CRF2 NAMs with optimal drug-like properties; (2) Characterize novel CRFBP-CRF2 NAMs in assays
measuring potency, selectivity and drug-like properties; and (3) Demonstrate in vivo proof-of-concept for select
CRFBP-CRF2 NAMs in rodent models of AUD. The CRFBP-CRF2 NAMs generated will provide powerful in vivo
probes for testing the role of the CRFBP-CRF2 interaction in vivo. We are well-positioned to develop potent and
selective small molecule CRFBP-CRF2 NAMs with excellent pharmacokinetic properties for in vivo proof-of-
concept studies in rodent models of AUD. This multidisciplinary research program has the potential for significant
scientific and medical impact by contributing to the discovery of new medications for AUD."

Neurons, like other cells, respond to stressful stimuli by mounting a series of pro-survival
responses. When the stress is sufficiently mild and/or transient, neurons can recover and resume
apparently normal cellular and network function. This proposal builds on our recent discovery of
“actinification:” a pro-survival reorganization of the neuronal actin cytoskeleton in response to the
perturbed osmoregulation that occurs during stroke in vivo and NMDA receptor hyperactivation in
vitro in which F-actin rapidly depolymerizes from dendritic spines and assembles into long,
extremely stable filaments within the soma and dendrite. Actinification is induced by the
convergence of cell swelling and calcium influx that activates inverted formin 2 (INF2). Direct
manipulation of the level and activity of INF2 show that it positively regulates the induction of
actinification and subsequent resistance to cell death. Our central hypothesis is that INF2-
dependent actin reorganization is an essential mechanism that confers a temporary pro-survival
advantage to neurons undergoing excitatory stress by protecting the somatodendritic
compartment from acute damage while preserving synaptic circuitry. We propose to apply
biochemistry and cell biology approaches to a) identify the molecular mechanisms that underlie
INF2-dependent actinification; b) to define how actinification confers resistance to cell death and
c) to characterize actinification-associated changes in synapse functionality during stress and
recovery. These experiments will accelerate a fundamental understanding of pro-survival
responses to stress that are specifically relevant to stroke, seizure, and brain trauma, and broadly
relevant to Alzheimer’s and other chronic conditions that are exacerbated by excitotoxicity."

 Metabolic labeling with heavy water followed by LC-MS quantifies the turnover of thousands of proteins in vivo.
As a cost-effective and easy-to-use stable isotope labeling tracer, heavy water has been used to study the
turnover of proteins in the heart, liver, kidney, blood, and brain of various model animals such as mice, rats,
dogs, and fish. Since the deuterium in heavy water is incorporated into all non-essential amino acids, virtually all
peptides are labeled. However, despite the ubiquitous nature of heavy water labeling, only 30-40% of all
quantified peptides are useful for protein turnover rate estimation. Most of the mass spectral data is filtered out
due to the low goodness-of-fit characteristics (such as the coefficient of determination, R2). Our long-term goal
is to develop a unified dynamics of biomolecules (proteins, lipids, and metabolites) using heavy water labeling
and LC-MS-MS/MS to study changes in diseases. The objective of this project is to develop techniques to
increase the throughput, statistical power, and accuracy of protein turnover estimation. To achieve our
objectives, we will pursue two Aims.
 In the first Aim, we employ a new approach to estimate protein turnover from isotope labeling of fragment ions
in tandem mass spectra. Unlike the intact peptide ions (used in current bioinformatics techniques), the fragment
ions are less affected by space-charging, limited dynamic range, and overlapping profiles caused by co-eluting
contaminants. However, new techniques need to be developed and applied to estimate label enrichment from
truncated isotope distributions observed in tandem mass spectra. In addition, a statistical normalization modeling
will be required to account for the limited isolation width of peptides chosen for fragmentation. In the second Aim,
we develop a model of label incorporation which uses two pools of amino acids and accounts for the individual
labeling kinetics of each amino acid. The traditional methods of estimation of label incorporation assume a single
amino acid pool – newly synthesized, labeled amino acids. However, it has been observed that peptide rates
are dependent on the amino acid composition. The labeling kinetics of each amino acid is dependent on its
biogenesis pathway. The proposed computational tools will improve the accuracy of protein turnover estimations.
They will increase the depth of proteome coverage and statistical power in the studies of in vivo protein turnover
using heavy water metabolic labeling and LC-MS."

 Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare (~1 in every 100,000 live births) but catastrophic disease that causes
premature death between the ages of 10 and 30 years. There is no cure or disease altering therapy available. It
is characterized by a progressive and severe loss of motor coordination (ataxia) and cerebellar
neurodegeneration. Immune deficiency and cancer are also prevalent symptoms. In 1995, deficiency in the A-T
mutated (ATM) protein was identified as the underlying cause of A-T. However, researchers have yet to
determine how a DNA repair pathway protein like ATM preferentially induces cerebellar pathology and ataxia.
This knowledge gap arises from the lack of a suitable animal research model that recapitulates the clinical ataxia
and cerebellar pathology—more than six different ATM deficient mouse variants have been generated but all fail
to develop a clinical phenotype. We recently overcame this roadblock by enhancing the rate of genotoxic stress
in the mouse using a genetic double-hit strategy. Our novel double knockout (dKO) mouse lacks expression of
both Atm and aprataxin (Aptx), a related DNA repair gene. We find the dKO mice develop a clinical phenotype,
including progressive and severe ataxia along with cerebellar neurodegeneration that is not present in either the
Atm or Aptx single knockouts. In ataxic dKO mice, we find that a subset of genes controlling Purkinje neuron
function are preferentially downregulated (e.g., Itpr1 and Car8) due a distinct chromatin architecture that leaves
them preferentially open to DNA damage. Consistent with this, our initial examination shows that Purkinje
neurons in dKO mice display significant signs of physiological and morphological abnormalities. We therefore
hypothesize that progressive ataxia in A-T results from DNA damage induced downregulation of genes that
control PN physiology leading to increased PN dysfunction and abnormal cerebellar circuit activity and output to
motor centers. In three AIMs, we propose experiments to establish a temporal link between ataxia severity
and the magnitude of protein downregulation, PN pathophysiology, and abnormal cerebellar circuit
activity at the molecular, cellular, circuit, and system levels. In Aim 1, we will correlate the temporal
progression (early to late) of increasing ataxia to a specific set of Purkinje neuron pathologies using in vitro
electrophysiological, Ca2+ imaging, histology, and measurements of gene expression. In Aim 2, we will establish
the pathogenic neural circuit activity changes that arise in A-T both within the cerebellum and its downstream
projections (e.g., motor thalamus) using a cutting-edge, in vivo multielectrode array recording technique in awake
behaving mice. Finally, in Aim 3, we will assess the pivotal role Purkinje neurons play in A-T etiology by testing
whether loss of ATM expression alone in these cells is sufficient to generate ataxia and cerebellar defects.
Moreover, in Aim 3, we will test if selective chemogenetic and pharmacological modulation of pathological
Purkinje neurons can alleviate ataxia. Results will provide new therapeutic targets and a broad understanding of
how ATM deficiency can alter cerebellar structure/function and circuit to cause a relentless ataxia."

Working memory is a form of short-term memory that is required for most daily activities, from
reading, to driving, to conversing. As such, deficits in working memory are highly disabling and
are prominent in learning disability, ADHD, and in Schizophrenia where it is the most important
predictor of long-term prognosis. Currently, no treatments exist to improve working memory.
Pioneering studies in humans and animal models established a central role for the prefrontal
cortex in enabling working memory. Emerging work from our lab and others demonstrate
important complimentary roles of thalamus in shaping thalamo-cortical synchrony underlying
working memory. An important next step is to understand the molecular programs in thalamus
that sustain such long-range thalamo-cortical neural activity on the time-scale of seconds to tens
of seconds during working memory. This will provide new mechanisms for how memory is enabled
on short time-scales, and also offer therapeutic targets for reversing working memory deficits.
Towards this, we recently identified a novel orphan receptor that functions in thalamus as a potent
modifier of short-term memory. In this proposal, we will delineate the chronic (steady-state)
transcriptional and gene-regulatory programs downstream of Gpr12 that promote and maintain
working memory. We will also identify acute (activity-dependent) recruitment of Gpr12
downstream signaling during working memory behavior. Finally, we will link Gpr12 molecular
function with its role in maintaining sustained and synchronized thalamo-cortical activity during
working memory. The overarching goal of this work is to provide new insight into molecular
programs in thalamus that shape thalamo-cortical activity underlying working memory. Such
discoveries will inform how our brains enable us to maintain task-relevant information on short
time-scales. More broadly, this study will help work towards novel therapeutic strategies for
reversing working memory deficits associated with schizophrenia, and related mental illnesses."

Current therapeutics, including the biologics, improve management of arthritic joints but often do not adequately
address associated pain, suggesting multiple mechanisms. Delivery of antibodies/immune complexes in serum
from a K/BxN mouse to a normal mouse yields a persistent, but reversible joint inflammation accompanied by
early onset pain that persists long after resolution of inflammation. In the inflammatory phase, allodynia and the
conditioned place preference respond to anti-inflammatory drugs and drugs that block spinal sensitization, while
in the post-inflammatory phase, the pain phenotype responds to only to the latter agents. This profile is
accompanied by changes in joint innervation, DRG and dorsal horn biology, revealing a transition over weeks in
both sexes from an inflammatory to a polyneuropathic pain phenotype. The origin of this ongoing traffic and the
appearance of a post-inflammatory pain phase in the preclinical rodent model reflects a major change in the
phenotypic expression of channels and receptors within the DRG. Among the changes generated by
inflammation and nerve injury are concurrent, time-variant, increases in nociceptive afferent expression of
sodium channels (e.g., NaV 1.3,1.7,1.8,1.9) and down regulation of potassium channels (e.g., Kv1.4), changes
which yield increased afferent excitability and ectopic activity. Here we will utilize the CRISPR-dCas9 system
coupled with transcriptional activation domains or transcriptional repression domains to enable either activation
or repression of the above genes epigenetically to systematically study their roles in modulating pain states. We
have already extensively characterized the efficacy, duration, and safety profiles of epigenetic repression of
NaV1.7 in DRG primary afferents via intrathecal (IT) AAV9 (CRISPR)-dCas9 delivery. Our work has shown, in
vitro and in vivo after intrathecal delivery, titer dependent reduction in DRG NaV1.7 mRNA and allodynia in
murine inflammatory and polyneuropathic pain models. We propose now, using this IT AAV CRISPR-dCas9
epigenome modifying platform to focus in male and female K/BxN mice on the inflammatory and poly-neuropathic
joint pain component of repressing DRG NaV 1.3, 1.7,1.8,1.9 and increasing expression of Kv 1.4-channels. We
will characterize these modifications in K/BxN and K/BxN- IT AAV9 (CRISPR)-dCas9 treated male and female
mice on i) DRG target expression using RNA seq/RNA-FISH; ii) K/BxN driven allodynia / aversiveness (using
conditioned place preference); iii) adverse event profile; iv) ectopic activity and membrane excitability (patch
clamping) in primary DRG neuronal cell cultures and v) in vivo basal and evoked afferent substance P release.
These aims provide mechanistic insights into the role of. these DRG-afferent channel populations in the
inflammatory and post inflammatory arthritic pain phenotype accounting for the ongoing and evoked pain
phenotype. These insights into regulation of multiple DRG channels will also guide improved engineering of
potential therapeutic interventions."
10806166,"In adulthood, stroke damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) causes a large, contralateral loss of conscious
vision referred to as hemianopia or cortical blindness (CB). Although this condition affects up to ½ million new
cases each year in the US alone, there is a total lack of accepted vision restoration therapies – in marked
contrast with early-onset physical therapies prescribed to those with motor cortex damage. Two decades of
work in chronic CB patients, whose deficits are deemed stable, permanent and thus amenable to scientific
study, have generated one method consistently able to recover vision after long-standing V1 damage: gaze-
contingent visual training to detect or discriminate stimuli in the blind field. Over the last 2 grant periods, we
have taken clear leadership in the field, providing hope that an effective therapy for CB may finally be on the
horizon. However, while characterizing training-induced recovery and its underlying mechanisms, we also
found that recovery in chronic CB requires months of daily training and the vision restored is low-contrast,
coarse, impaired by excessive internal processing noise and restricted to the blind field perimeter.
Accumulating evidence suggests that these limitations may occur because chronic patients have lost a
substantial portion of neurons that contribute to vision fundamentals not only in V1, but through retrograde
degeneration, in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and retina. Our new pilot data show subacute CB
patients <6 months post-stroke to lack significant signs of degeneration, and more than half of subacutes
tested retained visual discrimination abilities in their blind field, which disappeared by the start of the chronic
period (6 months post-stroke). Moreover, when training was administered to subacutes, they recovered the
same discrimination abilities as chronics, but much faster, and with recovery extending deeper into their blind
field. These data form a strong premise for testing the hypothesis that substantial differences in plastic
potential between subacute and chronic V1-stroke visual systems can be exploited to maximize visual
restoration in CB, and that the extent of recovery attainable is limited by the amount of retrograde
degeneration sustained. We now propose to: (Aim 1) assess how visual performance relates to structural
evidence of retrograde degeneration in the subacute period post-V1-stroke. We will then (Aim 2) assess the
impact of subacute training on blind-field functions, the progression of retrograde degeneration and the
continued potential for training-induced recovery in the chronic period. Finally, we will (Aim 3) contrast
mechanistic substrates of perceptual learning in subacute & chronic CB. All in all, the work proposed is unique
in the field, which it stands to advance significantly by generating entirely new knowledge and understanding of
the change in visual plastic potential with time in the early period after permanent V1 damage in humans. This
knowledge is important both neuro-scientifically, and for devising more effective treatment and realistic
outcome expectations for this growing patient population."

Mutations in genes that glycosylate alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG) are frequent causes of a spectrum of muscle
disease ranging from congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) to childhood and adult onset limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy (LGMD). These devasting myopathies are deemed dystroglycanopathies and cause muscle wasting,
progressive weakness, and degeneration of skeletal muscle leading to loss of ambulation, difficulties in
breathing and premature death. The α-DG glycosyltransferase genes include, among others, FKTN, FKRP,
POMT1, POMT2, and POMGNT1 and together account for >50% of genetically diagnosed CMD/LGMD.
Accurately diagnosing patients with CMD or LGMD before symptom onset or early in the course of the disease
has the potential to enable the use of preventative gene therapy or other therapeutics and in most cases can
only be done through genetic testing in pre-symptomatic individuals or prenatally. When a new DNA variant in
one of these genes is observed in a patient, however, there is often insufficient evidence to classify it as
pathogenic. Within this study, we will use a new approach to express and characterize every possible
missense variant in the assessed genes to advance our understanding of dystroglycan biology, improve the
interpretation of genetic variation in dystroglycanopathy genes, and advance CMD/LGMD care and treatments.
We will employ deep mutational scanning, a method for measuring the effects of massive numbers of
missense variants of a protein simultaneously. Further, as only a subset of CMD and LGMD patients have
potentially pathogenic variants in known muscular dystrophy genes, we will perform CRISPR screens in
different cellular contexts to identify genes contributing to abnormal alpha-dystroglycan function. Our two aims
are: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible missense variant in FKTN, FKRP, POMT1, POMT2, and
POMGNT1 on protein stability, alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation and cellular adhesion and 2) Perform in-depth
analysis of dystroglycanopathy patient variants integrating multiple in vitro assays, clinical information and
patient specimen biochemical analysis to validate our DMS approach and disseminate pathogenicity
predictions. The functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the
characterization of dystroglycanopathy gene variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand
muscle biology, improve the clinical translation of dystroglycanopathies and CMD/LGMD using genetic
information, and inform new treatments."

Abstract
The overarching goal of this study is to develop epigenomic liquid biopsy methods for both the early detection
and ongoing prediction of the clinical trajectories that result in preterm birth (PTB). PTB is the most important
problem in modern obstetrics. Despite ongoing efforts to understand its etiologies, there are no screens that
reliably identify at-risk expectant mothers early in gestation. Furthermore, in the case of preeclampsia (PE), the
clinical trajectory of disease, once diagnosed, is difficult to predict. Similarly, for fetuses affected by intrauterine
growth restriction (IUGR) it is impossible to identify in early gestation those that will have the poorest outcomes.
Building on our pioneering work in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) we propose to develop a liquid biopsy
screen for PTB and analytical methods that will predict the clinical trajectories of PE and IUGR. Liquid biopsy of
cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a powerful tool for non-invasive diagnosis and phenotyping of human disease. cfDNA
contains a wealth of biologically important information, if one has the analytical tools to exploit it. For example,
methylation signatures on cfDNA fragments in maternal plasma contain information relating to their tissue(s) of
origin, as well as indicators of epigenomic dysregulation associated with pathological changes within those
tissues. We have developed analytical methods that can detect DNA methylation changes in maternal and fetal
tissues many weeks before the onset of PTB.
The cascade of events that culminate in PTB has several possible underlying pathophysiological pathways.
These pathways may be initiated weeks to months before clinically apparent preterm labor or preterm rupture of
membranes. We propose to develop two kinds of ""early warnings"". One will predict the trajectories of
pregnancies, particularly pregnancies that experience mild or severe preeclampsia (PE) (Aim 1) or IUGR (Aim
2). These predictions will be made after a clinical diagnosis and are intended to help with clinical management
of the pregnancy. The other will be a screen, administered between weeks 10 and 13, for pregnancies that are
likely to end in preterm birth (Aim 3)."
10802950,"The host diet and gut microbiome combine to produce a range of microbiome-generated plasma
metabolites that influence human health. Characterizing these metabolites and their relationships with major
disease endpoints is critical to elucidate new pathways of risk and corresponding novel preventive and
pharmacologic treatments. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan are the three aromatic amino acids (AAA),
centrally involved in protein synthesis and metabolized to a range of bioactive compounds. Gut microbial
enzymes ferment AAA into a plethora of small molecules via deamination, oxidation, and/or reduction. The gut
microbe-derived metabolites can be further metabolized by host liver enzymes before they reach systemic
circulation. Several AAA-derived microbial metabolites have been previously identified as of potential interest
in human health, such as indole-3-propionic acid (I3PA), derived from microbial metabolism of tryptophan and
implicated in diet induced obesity, advanced atherosclerosis, gut permeability, and brain health. However, the
health effects of this and other AAA-derived microbial metabolites remain understudied.
This project resubmission will leverage the power of serial biomarkers measures to investigate the
interrelationships of novel microbiome-generated AAA metabolites with initiation, extent, and clinical onset of
subclinical CVD, clinical CHD, and total mortality. Primary aims include: (1) To investigate the independent
relationships of serial measures of plasma aromatic amino acid (AAA)-derived microbial metabolites with
longitudinal onset and progression of subclinical CVD. (2) To investigate the independent relationships of serial
measures of plasma AAA-derived microbial metabolites with incident CVD events. (3) To investigate the
independent relationships of serial measures of plasma AAA-derived microbial metabolites with total mortality.
Secondary Aims include focuses to investigate (a) the independent dietary, lifestyle, and demographic
predictors of plasma AAA-derived microbial metabolites and change in these metabolites over time in two
diverse community-based populations; and (b) potential effect modification of metabolite-outcome associations
by age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, background diet, lipid-lowering medication use, renal
function, and prevalent CVD.
This project will provide novel, impactful evidence on how AAA-derived microbial metabolites, measured
serially over time, relate to subclinical CVD, clinical CVD, and mortality in the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA; 6,800 middle-aged white, Black, Hispanic, and Chinese adults) and the
Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 5,148 older white and Black adults). In pilot work, we have evaluated the
long-term reproducibility of these AAA analytes using serial blood samples collected at baseline (year 2) and 9
years later (year 11) in a random subset of 100 CHS participants."
10802952,"Project Summary
Valvular heart disease is an important health problem afflicting over 2.5% of the US population and catheter-
based therapies to address it have advanced significantly in recent years. While surgical repair remains the
gold standard, the reduced risk of catheter-based interventions has provided the ability to intervene earlier in
the disease process and in patients too sick for surgery while avoiding the risks of cardiopulmonary bypass.
A significant limitation of these procedures, however, is that they do not provide the capability to remove
native tissue and previously implanted devices to tailor the anatomy to receive a new prosthetic device. For
example, transcatheter valves rely on displacing the diseased valve leaflets rather than removing them. In
transcatheter aortic valve replacement, the displaced leaflets can obstruct blood flow to the coronary arteries
and prevent access for subsequent coronary interventions. In transcatheter mitral valve replacement, the
native anterior leaflet can be forced into the left ventricular outflow tract resulting in restricted flow into the
aorta. Recently, a transcatheter technique has been introduced to lacerate a leaflet along its midline from
base to tip. When performed prior to transcatheter valve replacement, the new valve spreads the two halves
of the old leaflet apart so that they do not interfere with blood flow. This innovative approach can increase the
number of patients who qualify for these low-risk procedures. Since the procedure relies on the use of existing
guidewires and catheters, however, it is technically challenging, requires multiple clinicians to perform and
takes more time than valve replacement. Furthermore, the electrosurgical ablation used in these procedures
is not as effective for calcified tissue which is often present in native and bioprosthetic leaflets. To address
this need, we propose to develop a catheter-based technology that enables a single operator to perform
precise cutting of native and bioprosthetic leaflets regardless of calcification. In Aim 1, we will develop a
steerable cardioscopically-guided leaflet cutting catheter. We will develop and demonstrate the technology in
the context of aortic and mitral leaflet modification using electrosurgical cutting. In Aim 2, we will create a
laser-based leaflet cutting system to address the limitations of electrosurgery in calcified tissue. The
technology will be evaluated through in vivo testing and comparison with existing methods. Key innovations
of this research include real-time optical visualization of leaflets during cutting, the ability to cut a leaflet without
forming a wire loop through it, the development of laser-based cutting to precisely lacerate calcified tissue
and the characterization of emboli produced by leaflet laceration. This technology can provide a platform for
the future development of more sophisticated transcatheter tissue modification and device removal
procedures."

Diverse neuronal types are specified into correct cell fates and connected with proper targets during circuit
formation. Over the last decades, a number of cell surface molecules have also been identified that mediate
axon guidance and connectivity. However, little is known about the coordination between neuronal
specification and specific connectivity patterns, especially when two synaptic partners undergo two different
modes of cell specification (stochastic vs. deterministic). The Drosophila color vision circuit is an appealing
model to address this question mechanistically due to our deep knowledge of its development and neuronal
connectivity, where Dr. Chen’s primary mentor, Dr. Claude Desplan, at New York University has been a
leading expert in this field. In the fly retina, yellow (y) and pale (p) subtypes of color photoreceptors (R7 and
R8) are stochastically specified, whereas their synaptic partners in the optic lobe are produced through highly
deterministic programs. The first aim (K99) of this project is to characterize the y/p columnar stochastic circuits
in the higher brain regions. Dr. Chen will perform EM connectomic analyses under the training of Dr. Michael
Reiser to reconstruct the color vision circuit. Dr. Chen will also make highly cell-type-specific developmental
driver lines for gaining genetic access to the cell types of interest. High-resolution transcriptomes for neurons
downstream of either y or p pathway will be generated via Tango-seq under the mentorship of Dr. Chen’s
collaborator, Dr. Justin Blau. The second aim (K99) of this project is to identify molecules required for synaptic
partner matching. In collaboration with Dr. Graeme Mardon, Dr. Chen has accessed and used the single-cell
RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets of both developing retina and optic lobes to identify promising
candidates that mediate synaptic connectivity of y/p neuronal subtypes. Dr. Chen will be trained by Dr. Robin
Hiesinger to perform ex vivo live imaging of developing optic lobes to identify the functional role of these
candidate molecules in synaptic partner matching. The third aim will be performed in Dr. Chen’s independent
lab (R00) to study how the synaptic partner choices propagate to neurons further downstream by perturbating
the cell fates of R7 and R8. Dr. Chen will compare whether a given neuron uses the same or different
molecular codes for matching its pre- and post-synaptic partners. Successful completion of this proposal will
uncover novel molecular mechanisms regulating synaptic pairing and probe the fundamental principles
underlying the propagation of cell fate choices during circuit assembly. The principles identified here will be
significant and applicable to other neuronal circuits facing similar developmental challenges, such as the
olfactory system in rodents and color vision in humans. To achieve Dr. Chen’s career goal of becoming an
independent scientist in a leading research university, Dr. Chen has assembled a great mentoring team,
including Dr. Claude Desplan and Dr. Jeremy Dasen (co-mentor), as well as his advisory team to ensure a
successful career and scientific progression during the funding period.

This is one of the first mixed methods studies to examine barriers to healthcare, medical comorbidities [i.e.,
cardiovascular risk factors (CRF)], and accelerated brain aging in Hispanic persons with multiple sclerosis (H-
pwMS). This CDA will provide the necessary support for Dr. Cristina Román, a trained clinical psychologist and
early career researcher, to obtain the mentorship and training needed to reach her long-term of goal of
becoming an independent clinical researcher and leading expert in social determinants of health/health
disparities, brain aging, CRFs, and mixed methods. H-pwMS have disproportionately worse outcomes than
their non-Hispanic counterparts. These disparities are likely driven by social determinants of health (SDOH),
especially those related to healthcare access, since early intervention and consistent, ongoing maintenance
are critical to MS prognosis. As a minoritized group, Hispanics encounter more barriers to accessing equitable
healthcare, not only contributing to poorer MS outcomes, but also increasing their risk for comorbid medical
conditions, like CRF. CRFs independently and disproportionately impact pwMS and Hispanic persons living in
the U.S., Accelerated brain aging is emerging as an important biomarker of disease progression in MS that is
also sensitive to CRFs. The primary aim of the proposed study is to use mixed-methods to investigate the
impact of barriers to healthcare and CRFs on MS-related outcomes, namely level of disability and accelerated
brain aging. This project aligns with NIMHD’s mission to “improve minority health and reduce health
disparities.” We will recruit eighty English and/or Spanish-speaking H-pwMS to partake in virtual or in-person
study sessions. In addition, a subset of the sample (N=40) will undergo structural brain imaging. Study aims
are as follows: (1) investigate how CRFs moderate the relationship between barriers to healthcare access and
disability; (2) correlate accelerated brain aging to barriers to healthcare, accelerated brain aging, and disability;
and (3) qualitatively examine lived experiences accessing healthcare. This work will have direct implications for
early intervention, while also filling a substantial gap in our understanding of how societal factors directly
impact brain health and health disparities in neurological disorders. To this end, the current CDA will capitalize
on the on the rich infrastructure and resources of Kessler Foundation and provide necessary training in: (1)
healthcare related social determinants of health/health disparities; (2) modeling (i.e., machine learning) of brain
aging and cardiovascular influences; (3) mixed-methods design and analysis; and (4) professional
development. Dr. Román has assembled an exemplary mentorship team of experts: John DeLuca, PhD,
Jennifer Manly, PhD, Adam Brickman, PhD, Denise Fyffe, PhD with expertise in SDOH/health disparities,
cardiovascular influences on brain aging, and mixed methods design and analysis. The training afforded by
this CDA will ensure Dr. Román makes a successful transition to independent investigator who continues to
carry NIMHD’s mission to reduce health disparities."
10785282,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction is a leading cause of death in the US. HF is associated with
autonomic dysregulation and significant remodeling of calcium handling, excitation-contraction coupling, and
electrophysiology, which collectively lead to contractile dysfunction and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia.
HF incidence and outcomes are strongly sex-dependent; men have a higher incidence of HF, and in patients
with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, women display a lower arrhythmia propensity than men. The precise
mechanisms underlying these sex differences and the protection in female hearts remain unclear.
 Our initial studies discovered regional- and sex-dependent differences in b-adrenergic receptor (b-AR)- cyclic
AMP (cAMP) signaling that lead to previously unrecognized functional electrophysiological differences in male
and female mice, and could act as a potential anti-arrhythmic mechanism in female hearts. By combining whole-
heart, cellular, and subcellular approaches, this project aims to uncover novel mechanisms that underlie sex
differences in b-AR-cAMP signaling, which may play a role in sex-dependent outcomes in HF. A multi-level
experimental approach will be employed, investigating at the nanoscale, cellular, and whole heart level, to
examine: 1) the structural and functional mechanisms underlying sex differences in b-AR-cAMP signaling in the
intact heart, and 2) how sex- and region-dependent sympathetic remodeling in HF impacts b-AR-cAMP signaling
and arrhythmias. We propose to collaborate with a multidisciplinary advisory team to use novel whole-heart
FRET + optical mapping, isolated myocyte experiments, biochemical approaches, and super resolution
microscopy to assess cellular and subcellular mechanisms underlying regional- and sex-differences in b-AR-
cAMP signaling. How these signaling cascades and functional outputs are remodeled in a rodent model of HF
will also be tested. Completion of this proposal will significantly advance our understanding of sex differences in
cardiac patho-physiology and may provide insight into new gender-specific therapeutic approaches.

Progressive decline in seizure control and cognitive function, coupled with anxiety and depression are often
consequences of epilepsy that negatively impact a patient’s overall quality of life. None of the currently available
antiseizure medicines (ASMs) prevent or reverse pharmacoresistance or modify the risk for cognitive and
behavioral comorbidities associated with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE). Previous findings in our laboratory
suggest that oxidative stress contributes to epileptogenesis following a brain insult like TBI, stroke, or status
epilepticus (SE), and that treatment with dimethyl fumarate (DMF), the selective blood-brain barrier penetrant
activator of the transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), upregulates the intrinsic
antioxidant defenses of cells and reduces the severity of chronic epilepsy in animals following SE. We aim to
test the HYPOTHESIS that DMF is disease modifying when administered at the time of neurological insult and
at a time well after epilepsy diagnosis (e.g., post-symptomatic disease modification). Specifically, in the R61
Phase of this application, we will: 1) Determine the dose-dependent PK/PD relationship of DMF in naïve male
and female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (R61 Aim 1A); 2) Demonstrate that sub-chronic (7-day) drug-in-food
delivery of an optimized dose of DMF using our innovative automated medication-in-food delivery system will
result in predictable and stable blood and brain levels and Nrf2 target engagement roughly equivalent to levels
observed in Aim 1A (R61 Aim 1B); 3) Determine whether adjunctive oral DMF treatment with the ASMs,
levetiracetam (LEV) or lamotrigine (LTG) will affect steady state blood levels when administered sub-chronically
using our innovative drug-in-food delivery system (R61 Aim 1C). In Aim 1 of the R33 Phase of this application,
we will define the potential of short-term systemic administration of DMF to prevent or mitigate the anxiety,
cognitive decline, long-term seizure burden and ASM pharmacoresistance associated with kainic acid-induced
SE in male and female SD rats. In R33 Aim 2, we will determine whether late intervention with orally administered
DMF in rats with established DRE will improve pharmacosensitivity to the ASMs, LEV and LTG. At the
completion of these studies, we will have defined the early and late treatment disease modifying potential of the
novel first-in-class Nrf2 activator, DMF, using a clinically relevant approach in an etiologically relevant model of
acquired DRE. The development of a safe and novel first-in-class disease-modifying treatment for patients at-
risk for epilepsy would reduce the burden of disease and lead to significant improvements in their quality of life,
cognitive function and reduce the incidence of pharmacoresistant epilepsy."
10889337,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Despite its importance to the continuation of species, the differentiation of primordial
germ cells into functional oocytes is poorly understood. Primordial germ cells begin to
differentiate into oocytes during embryonic development in the mouse. The oocytes develop in
clusters called germline cysts, a conserved phase of oocyte development in both vertebrates
and invertebrates. Oocytes progress through prophase I of meiosis and arrest at the diplotene
stage. They then undergo primordial follicle formation during which germ cell cysts break apart
into single oocytes (cyst breakdown) and granulosa cells migrate around individual oocytes to
form primordial follicles. During the process of cyst breakdown, a subset of cells in each cyst die
with only a third of the initial number of oocytes surviving to form primordial follicles. The
mechanisms that control assembly of primordial follicles are not well understood. The long-term
goal is to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms used to establish the primordial follicle
pool in the mouse ovary. Published work from the applicant’s lab using ovary organ culture
suggests that signaling through the receptor tyrosine kinase, KIT, promotes the assembly of
primordial follicles. In addition, preliminary data suggest that KIT can signal through the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway to promotes primordial follicle formation but that
other signals besides KIT such as insulin may be important. The objective of this proposal is to
understand the role to understand the role of insulin in primordial follicle formation. The central
hypothesis of the proposed research is that in addition to KIT signaling, insulin signaling
promotes primordial follicle assembly through the PI3K signal transduction pathway activating
molecules that promote follicle formation and repressing molecules that maintain oocytes in
cysts. The specific aims of this research are to: 1) elucidate the role of insulin signaling in
primordial follicle formation; and 2) examine primordial follicle formation in a mouse model of
gestational diabetes. These goals will be achieved through techniques including
immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, ovary organ culture, and genetics. Research
proposed in the current application is significant because it will enhance current knowledge by
elucidating the mechanisms important to establish the primordial follicle pool. Results obtained
in this grant will help improve research efforts in ovarian biology and in treatment of conditions
causing female infertility such as primary ovarian insufficiency."

High-risk Neuroblastoma (HRNB) is an extracranial pediatric cancer in which up to 65% of patients are
resistant to therapies. Recent biomedical advances have improved treatment options for cancer patients. Yet,
there are no effective treatment for relapsed HRNB patients who have undergone treatment and experienced
tumor recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop more effective treatments that target relapsed HRNB.
A key feature of HRNB that drives disease progression is aberrant calcium (Ca2+) signaling. This offers
targeted therapeutic potential for Ca2+ channel inhibitors. Other groups have made progress in creating and
identifying Ca2+ channel inhibitors that may be used for cancer treatment. Our group is taking an alternative
approach by targeting Ca2+ signals that promote NB progression that are unique to relapsed HRNB. The
proposed project will leverage the elevated levels of cytosolic Ca2+ in relapsed HRNB driven by enhanced
store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) to promote mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and apoptosis. The hypothesis is
that the activation of autophagy prevents mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and apoptosis in relapsed HRNB that
otherwise might be prone to apoptosis due to the elevated SOCE. Therefore, combination treatment composed
of a novel drug 249 and an autophagy inhibitor will effectively kill relapsed HRNB.
Targeting the mitochondrial Ca2+ transporters to regulate apoptosis may offer a new therapeutic approach for
treating relapsed HRNB and a variety of cancers. A detailed understanding of mtCa2+ signaling will allow
targeting of the diseased tissue without deleterious effects on healthy tissue.
In addition, this work includes undergraduate and graduate student researchers, including those from
underrepresented minority groups. Therefore, this work will train the next generation of researchers and
increase diversity in the biomedical workforce."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major global health crisis, In USA alone 6 million people are diagnosed with
AD, and without any breakthrough this number will be doubled in the next 3 decades. While new treatments
(e.g. Lecanemab) can extend the self-sustaining life to 5-6 months, effective AD treatment still does not exist,
partially because of the lack of comprehensive understanding of the origin and AD development. Cognitive
dysfunction has been linked to altered brain function and structure. Recent brain imaging studies of AD
patients suggest abnormal brain activity and connectivity, hypometabolism, and loss of cerebral autoregulation,
implying sequelae of dysfunctional events occurring within the neurogliovascular unit. The hypometabolism
hypothesis of AD is that decrease in glucose metabolism causes insulin resistance which consequently alters
amyloid precursor protein processing, causes oxidative stress which lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, and
changes the neuronal and glial signal transduction. Technological barriers have limited the possibility of
disentangling when exactly neuronal and/or astrocytic dysfunctional events occur in relation to
hypometabolism, exhausted cerebral autoregulation, and vascular damage. To unravel the sequelae of
neuronal and astrocytic dysfunctions in relation to cerebral metabolism and cerebrovascular health, we
propose a novel fusion of optical-MRI to study AD longitudinally.
 We will conduct multi-modal optical-MRI experiments in mice during AD pathogenesis, specifically with
innovative advances that allow significantly higher sensitivity of Ca2+ imaging and with a newly developed
multi-wavelength optical system to measure reflectometric hemoglobin signals. Conventional fMRI will track
altered functional connectivity and cerebrovascular reactivity, calibrated fMRI will measure flow-metabolism
uncoupling, and 3D time-of-flight (TOF) angiography will map damaged macrovessels. Using the reflectometric
signals to measure blood volume, and 2D fluorescence imaging to map neuronal (red) and astrocytic (green)
activity, and angiography of microvessels (i.e., <40µm) using our green fluorescently tagged magnetic protein
nanoparticles (f-MPNPs) which also enables high sensitivity macrovessel (i.e., >40µm) mapping by MRI.
 Our specific aims are to behaviorally monitor the development of AD to determine the onset of AD, but in
conjunction with mapping deficits of neuronal/astrocytic dysfunction in relation to hypometabolism and reduced
CBF regulation in AD brain, and microlevel to macrolevel impairments of cerebral vasculature in AD brain in a
series of longitudinal experiments. Measures of functional activity and connectivity, cerebrovascular reactivity,
metabolism, and vascular health in AD brain will reveal insights of when and where these dysfunctions occur
and how distributed they are, information which could guide and track targeted treatments of AD patients. In
summary, this is an extremely significant scientific goal because it can reveal neuronal, astrocytic, and
vascular interactions underlying AD metabolism."

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a-herpesvirus that is ubiquitous in humans and infects epithelial cells and B cells.
EBV typically causes mononucleosis in humans but is also oncogenic and is associated with a wide array of
malignancies in humans including Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin Lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC),
and gastric carcinoma. Recently we identified ephrin receptor tyrosine kinase A2 (EphA2), which binds the EBV
encoded gH/gL, as the EBV epithelial entry receptor. EphA2 is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that
functions in the regulation of cell growth, survival, angiogenesis, and migration. It is expressed in adult epithelial
tissue such as gastric and oral epithelium. However, more recent studies and our data have shown that EphA2
may not be accessible in healthy epithelium for EBV infection. This indicates that EBV infection of the epithelium
is a complicated process that has not been fully elucidated. In our proposed studies, we will investigate the
mechanism of EBV infection of the epithelium using the Longnecker Laboratory's experience studying the
mechanism of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) epithelial infection and studying EBV B cell and epithelial cell
infection. For this proposal, in Aim 1, we intend to study the role of tight junctions in protecting normal epithelium
from EBV infection. We also plan to study whether LPS derived from Helicobacter pylori (HP) plays a role in
breaking tight junctions facilitating EBV infection since HP is considered a primary carcinogen in gastric cancer
pathogenesis. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether polymorphisms in EphA2 have different affinities in binding
to EBV gH/gL, signaling through EphA2 which may result in differences in the breakdown of TJs and altering
EBV infection. In Aim 3, since inflammatory conditions such as gastritis and HP infection may increase the risk
of for gastric cancer, we hypothesized that these conditions induce the expression of other receptor(s) or
co-receptor(s) that aide in the entry of virus into healthy epithelium. When we compared gene expression in HP
infected AGS cells and HP infected gastric tissue with that in control AGS cells or tissue without HP infection.
We found 15 potential genes which are membranes proteins that were upregulated in HP infected cells. We
plan to investigate if the encoded proteins regulate EBV infection positively or negatively. By investigating the
mechanism how EBV entry into epithelial cells, we will better understand the viral-host interactions, cellular
factors, and role of tissue damage, and inflammation in EBV infection of epithelial cells which will aide in
development of novel treatments and prevention strategies EBV-related epithelial pathologies."

10804846,"Photosensitivity is one of the more common sequelae of TBI, with over 50% of TBI patients reporting some
level of photosensitivity in the acute and/or chronic stages. Photosensitivity can range from mild to severe and
can significantly impair social, physical, and cognitive functioning, as well as rehabilitation outcomes. While
spectacle chromatic filters (i.e., sunglasses or indoor tints) are conventionally used to alleviate symptoms, they
are not designed to resolve issues with photosensitivity and have been associated with lower symptom
recovery over time, underscoring the need to develop more effective, non-invasive treatment options that can
reduce or eliminate photosensitivity. Recent work has shown that neurofeedback interventions, such as Low
Intensity Pulse-Based Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (LIP-tES) may be effective in treating post-concussive
symptoms and a preliminary case study from our research group suggests that LIP-tES may also be able to
reduce photosensitivity symptoms in veterans with a history of mild TBI. This represents an important
opportunity to address an area of high priority to Rehabilitation R&D, namely “the development of technology-
based interventions for chronic painful conditions that negatively impact outcomes”. However, both the
mechanism by which LIP-tES alters brain activity and alleviates symptoms across a range of disorders remains
unclear as does the neurobiological basis of photosensitivity associated with mTBI and psychiatric
comorbidities commonly seen in today’s Veteran population. These knowledge gaps represent important
limitations both for the clinical characterization of photosensitivity in Veterans and development/optimization of
novel treatment options. This proposal will take an important first step in addressing these two important
knowledge gaps. Aim 1: Complete a preliminary study testing the feasibility and acceptability of a novel
LIP-tES intervention designed to reduce severity of PS in patients with a history of mTBI. Extending a
recent case study completed by our research group, we will continue investigation of this novel intervention by
completing a pilot study of LIP-tES for the treatment of PS in veterans with a history of mTBI. Across 12 LIP-
tES and 12 sham sessions we will track recruitment capability (participants screened vs. enrolled, attrition rates
and reasons for attrition), acceptability and suitability of the intervention, evaluate suitability of the sham
procedure we developed, and gain preliminary evaluation of participant responses to the intervention. Aim 2:
Assess neurophysiological markers of PS and changes associated with LIP-tES intervention using
resting-state fMRI. Half of the participants enrolled in the study will complete three MRI scans during the initial
visit, midway through the study, and after the last LIP-tES or sham session. Preliminary work from our
laboratory has identified a sparse connectome of regions that are predictive of moderate/severe PS ratings in a
polymorbid sample of veterans from the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders
(TRACTS) longitudinal cohort study. Extending this work, we will test whether classification models using this
previously identified connectome will correctly identify individuals who report a reduction in PS after treatment
and whether connections are predictive of PS severity. We will further complete whole-brain exploratory
analyses to identify changes in resting-state functional connectivity across pre- and post-intervention scans
that are associated with changes in PS. By examining resting-state functional connectivity prior to and after
completion of LIP-tES, the proposed study aims to increase our understanding of the underlying
pathophysiological mechanisms of PS in mTBI and the mechanism by which LIP-tES may alleviate these
symptoms. We will further explore the impact of LIP-tES pre- and post-intervention on supplementary
measures of postconcussive symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, sleep, chronic
pain, and headaches in order to more broadly increase our understanding of the impact of LIP-tES on cortical
dynamics that underly these common comorbidities seen in today’s veteran population."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of legal blindness in individuals over 60 years old
including Veterans. It is characterized by central field vision loss where sharp, polychromatic images are formed
under the well-lit conditions in which modern humans are immersed, which leads to significant disability. The
high prevalence of AMD places a heavy burden on the healthcare system with upwards of 98 billion dollars spent
yearly on AMD-related healthcare costs in the US. Currently, there are no highly effective treatments for the most
common form of the disease, known as geographic atrophy, which makes up ~90% of advanced AMD. During
the past VA funding period, we studied visual cycle modulation and phosphodiesterase inhibition as potential
treatments for AMD and developed a novel mouse model to study a critical tissue involved in AMD pathogenesis.
Based on key findings we made during this funding period, we now propose to investigate details of retinoid
physiology and develop new retinoid-based treatments for retinal diseases including AMD. We can now
quantitatively interrogate and define the cell-specific functions of retinoid-binding proteins and enzymes with
multiple sites of expression within the body and leverage this information to more fully understand how to
provide therapeutic benefits to Veterans suffering from retinal diseases. We will pursue these objectives through
the following Aims: 1) Define cell-specific roles of cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP)
in visual chromophore synthesis and photoreceptor function. CRALBP is a retinoid-binding protein
that contributes to visual cycle function and is involved in a variety of retinal diseases. It is expressed in both the
RPE and Müller glia cells of the retina. Data suggest these two pools of CRALBP play different roles in retinal
physiology, but studies performed to date have produced conflicting results. Taking advantage of newly
developed tissue-specific CRALBP knockout mice, we will investigate the role of this protein in photoreceptor
function and retinal structure using a host of sophisticated electrophysiological, biochemical, and retinal imaging
techniques. Our data are expected to provide critical information about tissue targeting for gene therapy
approaches. 2) Evaluate the roles of lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) in ocular retinoid
homeostasis. LRAT is an enzyme critically involved in an ocular retinoid trafficking axis existing between the
gut, the liver, and the RPE. This protein plays a key role in retinoid storage in the liver and is also crucial for
visual function. Several outstanding questions remain regarding cell-specific functions of LRAT in determining
retinoid distribution and maintenance within the eye. We will clarify the roles of LRAT in the RPE and the liver
through tissue-specific LRAT knockout studies. We hypothesize that LRAT is crucial for both packaging of
retinoids in the liver for delivery to the eye as well as retention of retinoids within the RPE following delivery.
These models also allow us to assess the importance of alternative retinyl ester-forming enzymes in supporting
visual function. 3) Advance cis-retinoids as potential treatments for retinal diseases. Dysregulated
retinoid homeostasis is involved in various aspects of age-related vision decline including AMD. One
troublesome symptom of this condition, which also predicts disease progression, is a deficit in dim-light vision.
It is believed that this loss of visual function arises from impairments in visual cycle function, suggesting that
external retinoids may be effective treatments. Indeed, prior clinical studies have shown a beneficial effect of
retinoid supplementation on visual function in AMD patients. We recently demonstrated that a derivative of
vitamin A, 9-cis-retinyl acetate, is highly effective in restoring both peripheral and central visual pathways in
adult mice with a severe retinoid deficit. We will study the impact of retinoid supplementation on visual function
and retinal health as well as the mechanisms for cis-retinoid distribution to the eye. These studies are expected
to provide key proof of concept data for further investigations of cis-retinoid treatments in Veterans."

The primary goal is to advance the development of GLUT-targeting molecular probes to facilitate the
characterization of cells and discrimination between cancer and normal cells. High sugar uptake has long been
identified as a hallmark of cancer. Recently, the specific dependence of cancers on fructose for development
and progression outlined fructose uptake as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target. Respectively, changes
in the activity of facilitative fructose transporters (GLUTs) and alterations in the overall GLUT profile between
normal and metabolically compromised cells have set the foundation for developing GLUT-based approaches to
target cancer cells. However, specific targeting of disease-relevant fructose GLUTs remains a challenge, limiting
the use of GLUTs in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The proposed research program demonstrates the
targeting of selected fructose GLUTs (GLUT2, GLUT12, and GLUT5) for identifying fructose-dependent cells in
imaging applications. The proposal addresses several challenges in developing GLUT-specific molecular
probes, GLUT-targeting cell imaging, and GLUT activity screening approaches. The primary innovative
component enables discrimination between nonspecific fructose GLUTs allowing for designing specific
molecular probes for several cancer-relevant fructose transporters. The developments proposed in this research
include approaches for GLUT-based cell profiling, GLUT-based characterization of cancer cells, and GLUT-
based in vivo imaging. The direct outcomes of this research include the validation of a novel multi-color multi-
GLUT screening approach for measuring GLUT5:GLUT2 activity ratios through fluorescence and novel turn-on
fluorescent molecular probes for real-time monitoring and high-throughput fluorescence screening of GLUT
activity. The project will yield a new GLUT-based characterization of different breast cancer cell lines and identify
the fructose-dependent cell lines potentially targeted for in vivo imaging by GLUT-specific probes. The project
also advances the specific targeting of fructose GLUTs in vivo by developing GLUT-specific imaging probes for
PET applications. The research project is designed to be carried out primarily by undergraduate students under
the supervision of the PI and a graduate researcher. The program provides a comprehensive multidisciplinary
educational platform for undergraduate and graduate researchers and offers a hands-on research experience at
the interface of chemistry and biology. By engineering probes that can specifically target other fructose or glucose
transporters, we will advance to fingerprinting GLUTs to characterize and distinguish cells. GLUT-specific probes
will enable fundamental studies to foster an understanding of the impact of each GLUT and different dietary
sugars at the molecular level on health and disease."
10808381,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive form of breast cancer (BC) which occurs more
frequently in younger women, often diagnosed once the disease has already metastasized. It is the only BC
subtype where immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are approved for use, but only a minority of patients respond
to current ICI treatments. One mechanism of resistance is low expression of intratumoral chemokines CXCL9
and CXCL10, essential for attracting anti-tumor CD8+ T cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME).
Psychosocial stress, experienced by many BC patients can enhance immunosuppression. β-adrenergic receptor
blockade has shown higher survival benefit in TNBC patients compared with other BC subtypes (observational
studies), suggesting a possibility of sympathetic overdrive in TNBC. However, the mechanistic role of
psychosocial stress in treatment resistance to ICIs among TNBC patients remains unknown. We have shown
that chronic stress and its mediators, epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE), drive immunosuppression in
the TME by decreasing CD8+ T cells and increasing myeloid derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells. Our
subsequent study showed that propranolol, a pan-β-blocker, improves response to ICIs in metastatic melanoma
patients. We also found that EPI can mediate the induction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in BC tissues. We and
others have shown that PGE2 inhibits interferon (IFN)-induced CXCL9/10 secretion. Thus, I hypothesize that
chronic stress promotes immunosuppression in TNBC by increasing PGE2 and inhibiting IFN pathways, resulting
in decreased CXCL9/10. I propose to test this hypothesis in the following aims: 1) Examine NE-induced changes
in TNBC tissues and test therapeutic measures ex vivo; 2) Study immune changes in pre- vs. post-treatment
tumor tissues and blood of metastatic TNBC patients receiving propranolol and ICI; and 3) Correlate validated
measures of psychosocial stress with the expression of IFNs and CXCL9/10 in BC tissues. To achieve these
goals, I will utilize TNBC tissues from patients in ex vivo studies, conduct a prospective clinical trial, and examine
relationships between self-reported stress and correlates of tumor immunity in banked samples. To gain
mechanistic understanding, complementary state-of-the-art multiplex tissue imaging techniques including
confocal microscopy, imaging mass cytometry, and spatial transcriptomics will be utilized. Completion of the
proposed work will provide key novel insights into the mechanistic role of the PGE2-IFN-chemokines pathway in
stress-induced TME immunosuppression and help inform new approaches that will be translated into enhanced
therapeutic benefit for TNBC patients. This project will advance my development into an independent clinical
scientist and translational researcher advancing precision immuno-oncology treatments for TNBC. This will be
accomplished in a rich academic environment at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center and University at
Buffalo under the guidance of an outstanding mentorship team with complementary expertise in the areas of
breast cancer, immuno-oncology, TME-associated chemokines, prostaglandins, IFNs, and psychosocial stress."

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition that is
defined by difficulties in social interaction and communication as well as patterns of repetitive/stereotyped
behaviors and restricted interests. Multiple lines of evidence have pointed to the cerebellum as playing a
crucial role in the pathophysiology of autism. In particular, there has been long-standing interest in the
cerebellar dentate nucleus, which is one of the most commonly reported brain regions affected in post-mortem
studies of autism. In vivo investigation of the dentate in autistic individuals has been limited by difficulty
visualizing its structure using standard 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning due to its signal
properties (high iron concentration with resulting susceptibility artifacts) and convoluted structure with poor
boundary resolution at 3T. This has left us with a major gap in understanding how the cerebellum might
contribute to autism pathophysiology, as the dentate nucleus comprises nearly the entirety of cerebellar
projection to the cerebral cortex and is thereby crucial to development of a wide range of sensorimotor, social-
emotional and cognitive skills often impaired in autism. Recognizing the importance of investigating the
dentate, we propose to apply, in autistic children (and typically developing (TD) control children), a highly
innovative high-field 7T MRI approach that includes novel susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and
quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) methods developed by our research team, which are designed to
optimize visualization of iron-rich brain regions such as the dentate nucleus. Leveraging these innovations, we
propose (Aim 1) to then employ complementary univariate (region of interest; ROI-based) and multivariate
(voxel-based) approaches to examine for autism-associated differences in total and regional dentate volume.
We further propose (Aim 2) to leverage this vastly improved dentate definition, combined with resting state
(BOLD) at 7T, to assess for autism-associated differences in intrinsic functional connectivity of the dentate,
including ventral vs. dorsal components. Finally, we propose (Aim 3) to investigate, among ASD children,
associations between measures of dentate structure and functional connectivity (derived in Aims 1 and 2,
respectively) with core autism features. We have successfully acquired 7T scans using our innovative imaging
methods in both adults and in children (both ASD and TD) and have established high levels of intra- and inter-
rater reliability for delineating dentate nucleus volume, providing strong feasibility for the proposed
investigation. Our innovative proposal thereby has strong potential for “high reward” impactful discovery: It will
lead to crucial advances in understanding how differences in cerebellar dentate structure/function might
contribute to the pathophysiology of autism and, in doing so, help identify novel brain-based biomarkers
important for improving diagnosis, prognosis and targeted intervention, including offering a potential
therapeutic target for neuromodulation and other therapies."

Coordinated care, the process of identifying at-risk individuals and connecting them with health and social
services at the point of care, is an important evidence-based approach for optimizing service connection and
retention among individuals at highest risk for poor health outcomes. Survivors of intimate partner violence
(IPV) —a group with complex needs—would likely benefit from such care; while IPV coordinated care has
been theorized it has not to date been operationalized. Emergency departments (EDs) provide vital and often
life-saving care to people experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) making them an opportune setting to
disrupt IPV through intervention. Where EDs meet the acute medical care needs of IPV survivors, networks of
specialized community-based organizations (CBOs) support the short- and long-term needs of people seeking
to leave violent relationships. Despite their important roles, both service delivery sites face discrete and well-
documented challenges in meeting survivors’ needs; few efforts have been made to characterize facilitators of
successful transitions for IPV survivors, interrupting a potential pathway for survivors seeking safety from
abuse. The purpose of this study is to identify the facilitators of coordinated care allowing us to access
the levers of change to create a reliable system of care coordination that is feasible, viable and,
importantly, acceptable to all stakeholders, including IPV survivors, hospital and CBO staff. The results
of this R21 will inform intervention development using two complementary but distinct approaches—
Intervention Mapping and community-based participatory research (CBPR). We will accomplish this goal by
conducting 30 in-depth interviews with IPV survivors, hospital and CBO staff to determine individual,
interpersonal and organizational levers of change and facilitators of coordinated care resulting in a logic model
of change. We will also conduct six focus group discussions (up to 10 participants in each) with IPV survivors,
hospital and CBO staff to generate intervention themes, components, scope and sequence. Lastly, in
collaboration with a community advisory board of key stakeholders (n=6), we will validate the logic model of
change and finalize intervention design. These interrelated aims will provide data to develop standard
operating procedures for IPV coordinated care, which can be rolled out and measured in the intervention
production phase in future work. We anticipate that our findings will produce a model process for building IPV
care coordination, ensuring that IPV survivors are connected to the community-based care they need."
10810853,"The germinal center (GC) response is central in generating long-lived humoral immunity and the basis for
effective vaccination. GC B cells (GCBC) extensively remodel their transcription factor (TF) networks and gene
expression. GCBC undergo V region somatic hypermutation that generates the substrate for a cyclic process of
positive and negative selection in which surviving GCBC divide 3-4 times per day. Among the most pivotal
questions in GC biology is how signals lead to positive selection of higher affinity B cells, either by entering a
new cycle of cell division and/or rescue from cell death. How is selection in GC balanced against death and
differentiation into one of two possible long-lived fates: memory B cell (MBC) and long-lived plasma cell (LLPC).
Recent studies have identified certain putative surface markers as well as opposing and interacting transcription
factor networks that may control these events. One important clue comes from our recent studies showing that
the early GC reaction tends to spawn MBC while the late phase largely generates LLPC. In this proposal we will
use novel approaches to ask how different signals and downstream pathways interact to determine GCBC fate
(selection and MBC/PC differentiation and to elucidate precursor-product relationships of GCBC and progeny.
In work supported by our first cycle of funding, we have been focusing on how Ag-dependent signals—either
directly, via BCR, or indirectly, via recruitment of T cell help through antigen presentation—control the fate of
GCBC during positive selection in the GC. We found that BCR and CD40 signaling are dramatically
reprogrammed in GCBC compared to naïve B cells (NBC), with signaling from both receptors being substantially
yet selectively attenuated. In contrast to NBC, GCBC require both BCR and CD40 to ignite a positive selection
signal, as read out by expression of c-MYC and generation of p-S6. These observations raise a number of
outstanding questions. First, are IL-21 signals also interpreted differently by GCBC, as we found that IL21 and
CD40 stimulation only synergistically induce c-MYC in GCBC? Second, are cytokine signals contributing to
positive selection and determining how GCBC differentiate and if so, how? Mechanistically, since we know that
signals act in concert and synergistically, we would like to understand how BCR, CD40 and cytokine signals
interact, or “crosstalk”. Elucidating mechanisms of signal reprogramming and crosstalk will reveal how signals to
GCBC are integrated at the molecular level to determine appropriate responses of those cells. We will test a
hypothetical model that posits that early in the reaction, Ag is abundant and BCR signals predominate, which
favors MBC generation and GC maintenance, while at later stages IL-21 signals prevail, which favors plasma
cell generation. To test this model we will investigate, in Aim 1, how IL-21R signals are rewired in GCBC; in Aim
2, how, mechanistically, BCR/CD40 and IL-21/CD40 signals differ in terms of gene expression, epigenetics and
TF network remodeling; and finally in Aim 3, how selective BCR and T cell signals determine fate outcome in
vitro and in vivo. These experiments are at the conceptual and technical forefront of B cell biology."
10807975,"The mission of the NRG Oncology Statistics and Data Management Center (SDMC) is to provide all 
necessary expertise and personnel for the design, conduct and analysis of clinical trials and associated 
research for NRG Oncology, a member group of the NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) program. 
The Data Management Core of the SDMC provides the expertise to develop software, data collection 
mechanisms, database storage, and data management processes for state of the art clinical conduct, and to 
implement these tools and methods to manage the NRG Oncology clinical trial portfolio. 
 The 2019-2024 cycle represents the second period of the NCTN program, which succeeded the NCI 
Cancer Cooperative Group program, of which NRG Oncology was formed by the unification of three existing 
Cooperative Groups. During the first cycle of the NCTN, the NRG Oncology SDMC has expended significant 
effort harmonizing data management and information technology practices in order to successfully transform 
into a united entity operating under common procedures and using the Medidata Rave® database system. 
While maintaining a geographically distributed model, the Data Management Core now operates as a single 
highly efficient and productive unit, as evidenced by the successful initiation of 32 new trials and final approval 
on an additional 14 trials now in development, while continuing to maintain accrual and/or follow-up to primary 
and secondary endpoint reporting on over 80 additional trials that were active at the inception of NRG 
Oncology. Publications from the group in the first cycle number well over 300. 
 In this second NCTN cycle, the Data Management Core will build on early success and continue to deliver 
comprehensive support for NRG Oncology clinical trials and related research, as well as support the additional 
information technology needs of the NRG Operations Center. Specifically, the Core will coordinate all study 
design and process decisions in collaboration with personnel from Data Management, Quality Assurance, 
Statistics, Information Technology, Protocol Development, and Imaging Technology. The Core will continue to 
advance the use of Rave® functionality, including edit checks, query management, study calendar 
implementation, automated email alerts, import of imaging data, and reporting functions. The Core will conduct 
systems analysis of protocol data collection, review, and reporting requirements, extending Rave® intrinsic 
functionality through custom programming, and develop additional data management tools for the web 
environment. The Core will provide comprehensive data quality control to assure data timeliness, accuracy, 
and validity. Finally, in information technology, the Core will continue to provide systems analysis, project 
management, and software development to support data management, statistical, and reporting needs for both 
the SDMC and the NRG Oncology Operations Office, and participate in NCTN working groups to support 
NCTN initiatives through systems analysis, code sharing, and the expansion of web services."
10784972,"Abstract
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating neuromuscular disease and a leading genetic cause of infantile
death worldwide. Despite exciting progress in the neuromuscular field that has resulted in novel therapies, there
remains no permanent cure for SMA. Therefore, developing a permanent treatment that treats the underlying
genetic perturbation and all systemic manifestations of this disease would transform patients’ life. SMA is caused
by mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. An important modifier of SMA severity is the number
of copies of a paralogous gene SMN2. The sequence of SMN2 mainly differs from SMN1 by a C•G-to-T•A
transition in exon 7 (“C6T”), which causes the skipping of exon 7 in most SMN2 transcripts due to alternative
splicing. While previous studies have demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or small molecules
targeted to SMN2 gene can transiently increase full-length SMN protein expression, this approach requires
repeated dosing and has incomplete penetrance that poses challenges for patients. Therefore, I am developing
optimized base editors (BEs) that enable precise genetic alterations within defined regions of the SMN2 gene.
In this K01 proposal, I plan to extend this work by optimizing the most optimal genome editing approaches and
investigating the use of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to deliver these novel editing technologies in SMA
mouse models. In principle, this will create a lasting single-dose permanent treatment for SMA with several
advantages compared to targeting mutations in the SMN1 gene or exogenous gene replacement. The success
of this proposal will provide solutions to questions at the intersection of the fields of genome editing and
neurogenetics, with broad implications for the entire neuromuscular scientific community. My primary mentor in
this K01 proposal is Dr. Benjamin Kleinstiver, an expert in the optimization of CRISPR technologies, and my co-
mentors are Dr. Rashmi Kothary and Dr. Kathryn Swoboda, world leaders in SMA-related studies. Career
development and training activities will include attendance to local meetings and seminars, attendance at
national and international conferences, scientific writing, mentoring a small group in the laboratory, and
managing collaborations with other academic groups and companies. The K01 Award would be a perfect
opportunity to prepare me for the transition to an independent career by developing important career aspects
and improving my knowledge in gene editing to establish my research program, so that I can address high-
impact questions related to SMA and other neuromuscular diseases
. M
y long-term goals are to lead a
translational research team to address fundamental questions related to neuromuscular physiology, diseases,
and disorders. The convergence between physiology, genome editing, and therapeutics is where I envision my
independent research laboratory will make an impact on human health."

Perturbation of mitochondrial proteostasis, a form of mitochondrial stress, activates the mitochondrial unfolded
protein response (UPRmt), a retrograde signaling pathway leading to transcriptional up-regulation of
mitochondrial chaperones and stress relief. Recent advances in mitochondrial biology link UPRmt to lifespan
extension independently of oxidative stress and damage in model organisms. These observations beg the
questions of whether mitochondrial protein folding stress and the UPRmt regulate healthspan and lifespan in
mammals. We have recently identified a novel regulatory branch of the UPRmt. We will elucidate the
physiological significance of this pathway in regulating stem cell aging, tissue degeneration, and degenerative
diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Using a gain-of-function approach, we will test the feasibility of
activating these molecules to extend healthspan during natural aging and ameliorate Alzheimer’s disease.
Collectively, these studies highlight a novel defense program that improves mitochondrial integrity and tissue
homeostasis. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide a critical mechanistic understanding
of how mitochondria and metabolism regulate tissue homeostasis. In addition to generating important basic
knowledge, these studies will provide new targets for developing potential interventions for aging and aging-
associated diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease."
10801171,"Autoimmune diseases are a growing health problem: there are many of them (>100); they are quite
frequent in toto (~10% of Americans); and their incidence has been increasing for decades. Autoimmunity results
from a breakdown in one or more central or peripheral mechanisms of lymphocyte tolerance induction or
maintenance. In the case of T cells, central tolerance is imposed within the thymus, key orchestrators being
medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which play critical roles in both negative selection of T effector cells
and positive selection of T regulatory cells (Tregs). A unique feature of mTECs is expression of hundreds of loci
encoding antigens typically associated with fully differentiated peripheral parenchymal cells (peripheral-tissue
antigens or PTAs). Most of this “misplaced” gene expression is driven by the transcriptional regulator Aire. Loss
of Aire in both mice and humans results in a multi-organ autoimmune disease; in addition, recent studies have
uncovered an association of Aire with several common human autoimmune diseases.
 During the last funding-cycle, we serendipitously discovered a second, previously unappreciated arm of
thymocyte tolerization: thymic mimetic cells. These cells are a heterogeneous set of (mostly) Aire-dependent,
post-Aire mTECs that have co-opted the lineage-defining transcription factors (LDTFs), chromatin-accessibility
landscapes, and gene-expression profiles of particular extra-thymic cell-types, while maintaining their mTEC
identity. To date, 15 different mimetic-cell subtypes have been identified, including tuft, muscle, ciliated, microfold
and sebocyte mTECs. Accrual of thymic mimetic cells depends critically on the LDTF(s) they express and
differentially on Aire. Directing expression of a neoantigen to mimetic cells tolerizes cognate thymocytes.
 Building on this discovery, and abiding by the molecular focus of this grant, THE OVERALL GOAL OF
THIS PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO ELUCIDATE THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING MIMETIC
mTEC GENERATION, IN PARTICULAR MOLECULAR RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE AIRE-BASED
AND MIMETIC-CELL BASED PATHWAYS OF T-CELL TOLERANCE INDUCTION. This goal will be addressed
by three independent and cross-informing Aims:
A. To determine how Aire and LDTFs influence each other’s genomic activities.
B. To determine how modulating the binding of Aire to chromatin in Aire-stage mTECs influences the
accrual of mimetic-cell subtypes at the post-Aire stage.
C. To unravel the lineage relationships of thymic mimetic cells.
 This study will yield novel (potentially the first) information on how thymic mimetic cells are generated –
in particular how the Aire-based and mimetic-cell-based arms of thymocyte tolerance induction are integrated.
This information should prove highly valuable in both dissecting mechanisms of diverse autoimmune diseases
and, potentially, manipulating thymic cells or molecules to treat or avoid them."
10932343,"Lung cancer is one of the most lethal of solid tumors. The overall survival rate for patients with lung cancer
remains low, at 21%. As 236,740 new cases of lung cancer and 130,180 deaths are expected in 2022, there
remains a pressing need to advance research into new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of lung cancer.
Solid tumors, such as lung tumors, are laden with abundant, tumor-promoting macrophages, monocytes and
granulocytes. These innate immune cells promote tumor progression through profound inhibition of T cell
recruitment and activation and through stimulation of tumor angiogenesis, stemness, drug resistance and
metastasis. Strategies that reduce the accumulation of myeloid cells or alter their functional properties
significantly slow or eliminate tumor progression in animal models of cancer and synergize with other therapeutic
approaches to improve cancer outcomes. We previously discovered that a myeloid cell specific isoform of
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, PI3Kgamma (PI3Kg), controls both myeloid cell
accumulation and immune suppressive polarization in tumors. Genetic or pharmacological inactivation of PI3Kg,
but not other PI3K isoforms, reduces myeloid cell accumulation in tumors and alters the transcriptional profile of
immune suppressive, pro-angiogenic tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) toward a pro-inflammatory, anti-
tumor phenotype. We have found that PI3Kg inhibition synergizes with chemotherapy and with checkpoint
inhibitors to activate memory T cells and reduce tumor growth in models of lung cancer, breast cancer,
melanoma, head and neck cancer and glioblastoma. Based on our findings, the PI3Kg inhibitor, IPI-549
(eganelisib), was developed as an immune oncology therapeutic. We identified signatures of re-activated
adaptive immune responses in tumor tissues from lung cancer patients who participated in IPI-549 Phase 1
clinical trials, indicating that PI3Kg blockade can re-awaken anti-tumor immunity in human tumors and thus may
provide therapeutic benefit to lung cancer patients. However, we also identified pathways of resistance to
therapy, indicating that further dissection of the roles that PI3Kg and its inhibitors play in lung tumors is warranted.
The exact biochemical and cellular mechanisms by which PI3Kg inhibits anti-tumor immunity in murine and
human lung cancer remain unclear. Deciphering these mechanisms will provide new therapeutic insights into
the mechanisms of tumor immune suppression. Therefore, we propose studies to determine which molecular
and cellular mechanisms are direct and indirect targets of PI3Kg mediated immune suppression, to identify and
treat pathways of resistance to PI3Kg inhibitor therapy and to evaluate the impact of PI3Kg inhibition on immune
responses in mouse and human models of NSCLC. The specific aims to accomplish these goals are: 1) To
delineate molecular mechanisms by which PI3Kg regulates macrophage transcription; 2) To determine
mechanisms by which PI3Kg controls lung tumor progression in vivo; 3) To discover and target mechanisms of
resistance to PI3Kg inhibition in lung carcinoma."
10805444,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
When we navigate a new environment, we have an internal understanding of where we are located in that
environment. To build this internal sense of space, our brains integrate over time our estimate of how far we
are walking and in which direction. I propose to study how brains integrate sensory information over time to
form a working spatial memory. This question is pertinent to human health because impairments of spatial
working memory are hallmarks of neurological and psychiatric disorders, like Alzheimer's disease and
schizophrenia. A more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying spatial cognition should ultimately
lead to more rational treatments for these conditions. I will study neural integration in the Drosophila central
complex, an emerging model for spatial navigation that has notable similarities with the mammalian
navigational system. Building on recent work that has characterized neural signals that track the direction and
speed in which a fly travels, I will analyze central complex cells for processes that might integrate such signals
into a working memory of a fly's position in space. The long-term objective of this project is to build a cellular-
and circuit-level understanding of how neural signals are integrated over time to form working memories of
spatial variables."
10805445,"ABSTRACT:
In cancer, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme activity is high in dendritic cells and regulatory T-cells,
hypothesized to modulate the immune response and also in cancer stem cells (CSCs) to aid the development of
recurrent resistant disease. It is therefore surprising that drugs targeting ALDH have not been developed to
modulate these processes in cancer. To investigate this issue, we tested the efficacy of existing isoform-specific
and broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitors on cultured cells and found that none were very effective at modulating cell
survival. Furthermore, we predicted that a broad-spectrum inhibitor would be needed due to the overlapping
functions of the ALDH family members. These observations provided the rationale to develop a non-toxic broad-
spectrum ALDH inhibitor, which would kill ALDH+ CSCs to prevent recurrent resistant disease, and improve
immunotherapy of melanoma. Thus, the central hypothesis is that a non-toxic ALDH inhibitor can be developed
to reduce recurrent resistant disease development mediated by ALDH+ CSCs and improve the efficacy of
existing immunotherapies by reducing immune suppression. Preliminary data show development of a potent
non-toxic ALDH inhibitor built on the backbone of the Isatin natural product. This agent eliminates CSCs with
high ALDH activity, preventing increases in ALDH+ cells typically seen with traditional drug treatments. Finally,
the inhibitor improves the preclinical efficacy of anti-PD1 immunotherapy in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model
where this approach alone is not effective. Based on these hypothesis-supporting preliminary data, the following
Specific Aims are proposed. First, determine how effectively a non-toxic broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitor
eliminates the melanoma ALDH+ CSC population that expands when treating with traditional chemotherapy.
Furthermore, determine its potency when combined with traditional chemotherapy to prevent recurrent resistant
disease development. This will be achieved by isolating ALDH+ and ALDH- cell populations from cell lines and
patient derived (PDX) tumors and determining inhibitor efficacy for preventing recurrent resistant disease
development when provided in combination with current clinically relevant chemotherapy. Finally, the
mechanistic basis for inhibition of resistance by the agent combination will be identified. Second, determine the
efficacy of a non-toxic broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitor on immune regulatory and effector cells in the tumor
microenvironment, alone and when combined with anti-PD1 antibody immunotherapy. Specific targeting of
ALDH in melanoma tumor cells and in host cells on therapeutic efficacy will be tested. Mechanisms leading to
enhanced immune response will be identified by defining the impact of the inhibitor and antibody combinations
on immune cell composition and function within the tumors, assessing the relative ALDH levels in the immune
cell populations, and using transient and genetic approaches to target the modulating immune cells. These
significant discoveries would demonstrate the efficacy of targeting ALDH enzymes in cancer for modulating
resistance and immune cell function, providing needed preclinical validation necessary for clinical translation."

In the United States, atrial fibrillation (AF) is the second most common cardiovascular condition in adults, after
hypertension, affecting 33 million individuals worldwide, with more than 7 million patients in the U.S. and
Europe, over 400,000 U.S. hospital admissions per year, 5 million office visits per year, 276,000 emergency
room visits per year, a $26 billion annual increase in U.S. healthcare costs, and a five-fold and an almost two-
fold increase in the risk of stroke and mortality, respectively. A key marker in the disease process is the
collagen and fibrosis formation in the left atrium (LA). MR imaging methods have been developed to assess
the left atrium, including fibrosis but are still unreliable and controversial. Specifically, late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) MRI has played a key role as a non-invasive imaging tool for in vivo visualization and
quantification of atrial fibrosis. However, the inconsistent image quality and the significant amount of expert-
level supervision involved in the fibrosis quantification process are major roadblocks to its reproducibility. This
proposal offers a new MRI imaging technique and an associated machine learning approach to better assess
the left atrium and to determine the repeatability of these measurements. Aim 1 will introduce robust and
repeatable MRI acquisition and reconstruction methods for obtaining isotropic resolution in a fixed time of LGE
images of the left atrium. Unique motion compensation models will be integrated into the reconstruction
methods for the LGE data. Aim 2 will provide accurate machine learning based methods for segmenting the left
atrium wall and assessing atrial myocardium fibrosis. Aim 3 will rigorously test and further refine the non-
invasive fibrosis assessment methods in an experimental canine model with fibrosis. Aim 4 will quantify the
reproducibility of the new acquisition, reconstruction, and post-processing methods compared to existing
methods in patients. This proposal will directly impact clinical science and standards of care in cardiology and
AF management through significant improvements to LGE imaging of left atrial fibrosis. Technological
contributions of this work will further impact the field of biomedical image analysis through the improvement of
MRI-based techniques for imaging cardiac tissue structure. To promote transparency and reproducibility, the
proposed efforts will be released as open-source tools consistent with the principles of reproducible research
and open science practices. This open-source nature will further make this project a catalyst for future
methodological innovations and clinical investigations. Our long-term goal is to streamline and standardize
atrial fibrosis quantification for the clinical management of AF patients, and this project will establish the
groundwork for achieving this goal."

The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved developmental pathway that controls organ size and tissue
homeostasis in all metazoan animals. Dysregulated Hippo pathway has been implicated in a wide range
of human disorders, including cancer. Despite the well-established Hippo pathway core signaling cascade, the
upstream regulation of the Hippo pathway is less understood. Here we identified Drosophila Myotubularin
( Mtm) as a novel upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway. Loss-of-mtm caused tissue overgrowth with
elevated expression of diap1 and expanded, two most well-known Hippo pathway target genes. mtm mutant
flies also exhibited increased interommatidial cells and aberrant posterior follicle cell differentiation and
proliferation, hallmarks of Hippo signaling defects. Mtm is a member of the myotubularin family of
phosphoinositide lipid phosphatases with known function in controlling membrane phospholipid dynamics.
Consistently, we found that Mtm is membrane associated and binds to multiple membrane lipids. Our
preliminary studies also revealed a strong apical F-actin accumulation in mtm mutant cells. We therefore
hypothesize that Mtm is a novel upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway that regulates membrane
phospholipid dynamics and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. The goal of this project is to understand the
functional relevance of Mtm-mediated phospholipid dynamics and actin cytoskeleton remodeling in Hippo
pathway upstream regulation. The objective of this study is to elucidate the regulatory relationship between
Mtm and the Hippo pathway known components (Aim 1), to determine the role of Mtm on membrane
phospholipid dynamics and its functional relevance in Hippo pathway (Aim 2), and to define the downstream
cellular function of Mtm in Hippo pathway regulation (Aim 3). Accomplishment of this study will provide novel
mechanistic understanding of how Hippo pathway upstream signals are coordinated."

In 2011 the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) convened a panel to explore the
paradox of why the US spends more on healthcare than other developed countries yet has inferior outcomes.
It concluded that “Data are simply lacking to fully understand the causal factors responsible for each of the
diseases and injuries that disproportionately affect the US population.” This is still true today. What’s notable is
that the US has shorter life expectancy with the 2nd highest cardiovascular death rate among peer countries
while still having the highest spending in the world (19.7% of gross domestic product).
In 2019 Drs. Cram and Landon founded the International Health Systems Research Collaborative (IHSRC)
with funding from the NIH (NIA R01AG058878) to compare treatment and outcomes across high-income
countries for cohorts of patients defined by common diagnoses and procedures. The current proposal will
leverage and expand upon our IHSRC infrastructure to compare health technology assessment (HTA) across
countries and evaluate how HTA relates to the utilization, adoption, and de-adoption of new cardiovascular
(CV) treatments and procedures. Many countries (including IHSRC members England, Netherlands and
Canada) have explicit HTA processes linked to public insurance coverage decisions for new therapies. The US
is notable for lacking a formal HTA process. While failure to embrace HTA likely contributes to excessively high
spending in the US, few studies have evaluated how different countries approach HTA.
The overarching objective of our research is to understand how advanced CV therapies are adopted and used
in 7 countries with advanced healthcare systems. Our research will focus on 3 cardiovascular condition dyads
where introduction/refinements in advanced therapy is disrupting an established therapy: 1) aortic valve
dysfunction where transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is in the process of supplanting surgical
aortic valve replacement (SAVR); 2) elective AAA repair where endovascular aneurysm repair is replacing
open repair; and 3) carotid artery stenosis where trans-carotid artery revascularization (TCAR) and stenting are
emerging as substitutes for carotid endarterectomy. Our research will address major unanswered questions by
providing crucial insights into how advanced technologies are adopted and used in different countries. We will
provide much needed clarity with respect to the ongoing and unanswered question of whether higher spending
in the US can be attributed to more rapid adoption and higher utilization of advanced therapies.
Our proposal has three specific aims that assess: (1) each country’s policy and health technology assessment
environment related to each procedure; (2) technology diffusion patterns in the context of their evolving policy
environments; and (3) differences in outcomes, including mortality, readmissions, and hospital-free days at
home. The scientific premise of our proposal is that granular information is needed to inform the study of
comparative health systems and to understand the adoption and diffusion of new technologies."

As one of two lineages of extant jawless vertebrates, lampreys represent a pivotal branch of vertebrate
phylogeny; they offer a critical source of information for understanding the evolutionary origins of our adaptive
immune system. While immunoglobulin domain-based receptors mediate adaptive immunity in all jawed
vertebrate groups, the variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR) system in lampreys and hagfishes is based on
receptors constructed of leucine-rich repeats (LRR). The VLRs are assembled by a gene conversion-like process
that sequentially copies sequences donated by fragmentary LRR cassettes into an incomplete germline VLR
gene. Although structurally unrelated to immunoglobulin and T-cell receptors, the function of three types of VLRs
are nonetheless rooted in B- (VLRB) and T-like lymphocytes (VLRA and VLRC), indicating that the basic genetic
programs for these cell types are a fundamental feature of adaptive immunity in all vertebrates. The proposed
studies focus on the diversity, functions and translational application of the lamprey VLRB antibodies, which are
expressed in a cell-surface form on B-like lymphocytes and as secreted polymeric antibody by mature plasma
cells. Our first aim is to characterize the development of the VLRB system beginning with early feeding larvae
and thereafter in multiple tissues of three-to-four-year larvae and adults. CRISPR/Cas9 strategies will be used
to perturb the function of candidate B-like cell regulators and signal mediators in embryos and larvae. We will
characterize the developing VLRB repertoire by analyzing high fidelity long-read sequence data for each
lymphopoietic tissue and developmental stage. We will also analyze scRNA-seq data from early larva and
ammocoete tissues to identify and characterize subsets of B-like cells and their stages in differentiation. In aim
two we will characterize the composite VLRB receptor. VLRB is expressed as a GPI-linked protein on the surface
of lamprey B-like cells, therefore implying that antigen-induced signaling requires associated transmembrane
domain proteins with cytoplasmic signaling capacity. We will conduct pull down assays on extracts from lamprey
VLRB lymphocytes using VLRB specific monoclonal antibodies and use mass spectrometry to identify
coprecipitated proteins. This analysis will be guided and supplemented by a set of candidate signal mediators
that we have identified from VLRB cell transcriptomes and scRNA-seq datasets generated in these studies. In
aim three we will produce and characterize monoclonal lamprey VLRB antibodies for basic and translational
applications. The analysis is focused on VLRB antibodies against highly lethal brain (glioblastoma and
astrocytoma) and ovarian tumors."

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are a revolutionary cancer treatment, with the particular benefit of
generating memory T-cells that can last for years and suppress cancer relapse. CAR-expressing CD8+ T-cells
have been shown to cure leukemia and other cancers in clinical trials with great success. However, many
challenges remain before CAR-based immunotherapy can become widely adopted, particularly for solid tumors.
A major problem is that CAR T-cells become “exhausted” or “dysfunctional” and display decreased therapeutic
effectiveness when subjected to prolonged antigen stimulation in the tumor microenvironment. Elevated cytosolic
calcium is associated with T-cell activation, and as such, calcium signaling activity can be used as a quantitative
measure of T-cell function or dysfunction. The history of calcium signaling over short and long periods of time
encodes information about the current functional capacity of the T-cell and the number of tumor cells encountered
in the past, and can be used both to evaluate populations or individual clones and to select for clones resistant
to exhaustion. However, imaging calcium signaling activity in vivo using traditional genetically encoded
fluorescent indicators presents unique challenges with T-cells and other highly mobile cell types, especially
when medium- to long-term activity tracking is required. There is currently no facile method to image calcium
signals at the single-cell level over long time periods or to track calcium activity history in such a highly mobile
cell population, either in vitro or in vivo. In this project, we will use several distinct varieties of photoactive
fluorescent proteins coupled with a family of high-contrast bioluminescent calcium sensors to generate Optical
Recorders for Calcium (ORCas) capable of reporting short-, medium-, and long-term calcium signaling histories
in CAR T-cells upon repeated exposure to target tumor cells. We will additionally engineer the small molecule
substrates used to time-gate history recording for improved bioavailability and cell specificity, and to diversify the
wavelengths of light emitted by the bioluminescent sensor domains of these probes. The engineered ORCas will
ultimately be used to (1) track the exhaustion status of CAR T-cells over long periods of repeated exposure to
target tumor cells, (2) enrich exhaustion-resistant populations of CAR T-cells from CRISPR knockout libraries,
and (3) quantitatively benchmark the exhaustion resistance of CAR T-cell clones. These probes will additionally
be validated in CAR T-cells in vivo in a subcutaneous mouse tumor model. Ultimately, we anticipate that ORCas
will be the first of a broad new class of genetically-encoded probes capable of recording specific biochemical
signal history non-invasively in many disease models and therapeutic interventions."
10804479,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Homologous recombination is an essential DNA repair process that facilitates accurate chromosome
segregation during meiosis, the specialized cell division that produces sperm and eggs. A fundamental gap in
our understanding of recombination during meiosis in mammals is the role the breast cancer associated
protein, BRCA2, which loads the central recombination enzyme RAD51 onto the ends of DNA breaks. This
knowledge gap persists because essential factors like BRCA2 are inherently hard to study, and reagents to
detect and analyze BRCA2 are limiting. These impediments are overcome in this proposal with the
development of genetic, genomic, and biochemical reagents and approaches to study the meiotic functions of
BRCA2. These include a fully functional epitope-tagged allele of the native Brca2 gene in mouse; high-
resolution mapping approaches to define BRCA2 binding sites genome wide; germ-cell specific Cre-lox mouse
lines to ablate Brca2 gene function at different stages of meiosis; and purified full-length human BRCA2 protein
and its partner proteins for biochemical analysis. Exploiting this unique constellation of tools, the long-term
objective of this project, to understand the roles and regulation of BRCA2 during meiosis in mammals, will be
pursued through three aims. Aim 1 will define the spatial-temporal binding patterns of BRCA2 and related
recombination factors using super-resolution immunofluorescence imaging, complemented by genome-wide
ChIP-Seq mapping. Aim 2 will determine the roles of BRCA2 throughout meiosis by inactivating the Brca2
gene in mouse spermatocytes and oocytes before, during and after meiotic prophase. Mutant phenotypes will
be analyzed using a battery physiological, histological, cell biology, and molecular assays. Preliminary data
support the hypothesis that BRCA2 functions at multiple stages of meiosis, and in the maintenance of ovarian
reserves. Aim 3 will define how a meiosis-specific chromosomal protein, SYCP3, modulates meiotic functions
of BRCA2 to optimize meiotic HR. Super-resolution imaging and genome-wide ChIP-Seq mapping of BRCA2
and related recombination factors will be performed in Sycp3 mutant mice. Biochemical assays with purified
human proteins will test the hypothesis that SYCP3 binds BRCA2 to facilitate the balanced assembly of
RAD51 and its meiotic homolog DMC1 at recombination sites to promote DMC1-catalyzed recombination

missing biology of BRCA2 function during meiosis in mammals. These fundamental discoveries will be
germane to understanding pathologies associated with human meiosis, including infertility, miscarriage,
congenital disease, and premature ovarian insufficiency."

Glycogen storage disease type III (GSD III) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by deficiency
of glycogen debranching enzyme (GDE) that leads to excessive accumulation of abnormal glycogen (limit
dextrin) in muscle and liver tissues. The majority of patients (~85%) have both muscle and liver involvement
(GSD IIIa) while others have disease limited to the liver (GSD IIIb). In absence of an effective therapy, patients
with GSD III are experiencing progressive liver failure and muscle damage accompanied by increased morbidity
and mortality. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated gene therapy has shown promise for treating inherited
muscle and liver disorders with successful translation to clinical trials. However, this approach has not been
advanced for GSD III because AAV is not capable of delivering the large (4.6 kb) human GDE cDNA, due to its
small packaging capacity. We have developed an innovative gene therapy approach with AAV9 in a mouse
model of GSD IIIa with two key components incorporated 1) a small bacterial GDE analog to overcome the
limitation of small AAV carrying capacity; and 2) a novel immunotolerizing dual promoter to prevent cytotoxic T
lymphocyte (CTL) response to the bacterial enzyme and enable long-term Pullulanase expression in all affected
tissues. The overall objective of this project is to identify a path forward for clinical translation of this promising
therapy. It is commonly known that the therapeutic outcomes of AAV vectors in mouse models does not always
translate into human. Current AAV serotypes, especially AAV9, transduce muscle and liver in mice with high
efficiency; however, high doses of AAV9 required to transduce skeletal muscles in human patients can led to
adverse hepatotoxicity or even liver failure. In this proposal, we aim to identify a lead therapeutic candidate AAV
vector in GSD IIIa mice using high potency cross-species compatible AAV capsids (ccAAVs) containing a de-
immunized transgene expression cassette to minimize gene therapy related immune responses and reduce the
effective vector dose (Aim 1a). We will validate the lead AAV vector in GSD IIIa patient muscle cells and human
liver chimeric mice to increase its clinical translatability (Aim 1b). We will then examine the long-term efficacy of
the lead AAV vector in GSD IIIa mice (Aim 2), and test its safety and efficacy in GSD IIIa dogs (Aim 3). Data
generated from the proposed studies will lay the foundation for translating this innovative gene therapy to patients
with GSD III. The concept of using a bacterial enzyme to treat human diseases through gene therapy may open
up new alternatives for therapeutic development for metabolic disorders caused by defects in large genes. The
immunotolerizing dual promoter technology can also be broadly used for treating other conditions that affect
multiple tissues with gene therapy."

Adipose tissue homeostasis and expansion requires the coordination of multiple cell types to accommodate
increases in tissue volume and metabolic requirements. An important component of adipose tissue regulation is
the lymphatic vascular system, which is responsible for the removal of extracellular fluid and for immune cell
trafficking from the tissue to lymph nodes. In obesity, the relationship between fat and lymphatics becomes
dysregulated, resulting in lymphatic vessel dysfunction, including decreased vessel formation, increased
permeability, and diminished contractility. Conversely, in conditions of impaired lymphatic function, such as after
lymph node resection, adipose tissue is dysregulated and experiences accelerated expansion in the affected
area.
Given the increasing prevalence of obesity and its complications, as well as the burden of lymphedema in millions
of post-surgical patients, the mechanisms which regulate the relationship between adipose tissue and lymphatics
are of significant interest. Broadly, this proposal will investigate cell-type specific interactions which govern this
relationship. The lab’s single-nucleus RNA sequencing data revealed that lymphatic endothelial cells express
the leptin receptor, indicating a role for leptin—an adipocyte-produced hormone which regulates organismal
energy balance—in lymphatic function. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that leptin augments lymphatic
tube formation and impacts gene expression, and Aim 1 of this proposal describes a plan to further define leptin’s
role in lymphatic function. Aim 2 proposes to study the adipocyte-lymphatic relationship from an alternative
direction by performing single-nucleus RNA sequencing on adipose tissue associated with lymphedema in
human subjects, thereby revealing changes in cellular composition and transcriptional profiles after disruption of
local lymphatics.
This five-year career development program will build on and expand the candidate’s skills and experience in
studying adipocyte biology, animal models of metabolic dysfunction, and single-cell RNA sequencing, while also
employing a number of new techniques to evaluate lymphatic vessel function. By assembling a mentorship team
and collaborators who are well-equipped to facilitate these studies, in addition to supplementary didactic work,
this project will enable the candidate’s transition to an independent career as a physician-scientist in the fields
of adipose tissue biology and metabolism."

Overdose deaths caused by cocaine use disorder (CUD) pose a major public health burden in the United
States due in part to a lack of pharmacological treatments. The hippocampus is a major brain region for forming
and maintaining drug associated contextual memories. Pharmacologically disrupting these associations, in
supplement with existing psychosocial treatments, can potentially reduce the health risks of CUD. My proposal
is driven by this critical need to identify novel molecular mechanisms underlying hippocampal regulation of
cocaine seeking behavior.
 My preliminary findings suggest a role for voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) in supporting cocaine
contextual memory, via regulation by the VGSC auxiliary subunit Fibroblast Growth Factor 13 (FGF13). I
discovered that fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 13 (FGF13) is expressed in a subset of nNOS+
interneurons. Deletion of FGF13 from this subset of hippocampal interneurons results in increased cocaine
conditioned place preference (CPP). I aim to define the roles of FGF13 in controlling hippocampal excitability
and subsequent role in cocaine contextual memory. I hypothesize that FGF13 plays a critical role in the formation
of cocaine-contextual memory by regulating VGSC function and consequent neuronal excitability of a subset of
nNOS+ hippocampal interneurons. I will address this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: To define FGF13 maintenance of sodium channel excitability in hippocampal interneurons.
Aim 2: To test FGF13 sufficiency in mediating cocaine contextual memory acquisition and extinction.
To perform these experiments, I will use a floxed FGF13 mouse line generated by our lab to record
electrophysiological properties of FGF13+ hippocampal interneurons (Aim 1) in response to cocaine exposure
as well as to evaluate the role of FGF13 in mediating cocaine contextual memory (Aim 2). My fellowship training
plan outlines the steps I will take to gain technical expertise in slice electrophysiology (Aim 1), for which I have
little prior experience, and to employ viral tools in studying mouse models of addiction (Aim 2), which are also
techniques that are new to me. The research environment in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at Weill
Cornell Medicine is well suited for me to complete my goals. The proposed experiments will help establish a
model by which FGF13 controls hippocampal excitability, and enhance our understanding of contextual memory
and drug addiction overall. The objective of this proposal is to identify FGF13 as a novel pharmacological target
for treating cocaine dependence."

 This is a research grant application for a study being undertaken in the laboratory of Dr. Aras Mattis, a
Scientist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). This grant will provide support for the Mattis lab
to conduct this research over the five-year term of this project.
 Differentiation of patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to hepatocytes (iPSC-Heps) has
incredible value for modeling and experimental treatment of human hepatic disease. My lab has significant
expertise in the differentiation of iPSCs to human hepatocytes and therefore modeling of liver diseases. The
major goal of this project is to use iPSC-Hep cell lines that we have developed from a single family of patients
with NASH and matched controls to study modeling of NAFLD in vitro and the relationship of novel genes we
uncovered to the disease process. First, we will use the iPSC-Hep model to test a set of genes with unknown
function for involvement in NAFLD. We uncovered these genes by sequencing this family with severe and
penetrant NASH. Furthermore, we will test loss of function knockouts of these novel genes in control iPSC-
Heps, for their ability to cause steatosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and/or inflammatory pathway
activation. Finally we will test a set of genes we uncovered as potentially therapeutic targets.
 The specific experimental aims of this project are to 1) Identify NAFLD pathways modeled in patient
7017 familial NASH iPSC-Heps, 2) Establish contribution of known SNPs and novel genes for involvement in
NAFLD Phenotypes, and 3) Test our previously identified genes as therapeutic targets in 7017 iPSC-Heps.
This project follows the mission of the NIH to support medical research on hepatic diseases with the potential
for clinical translational use."

Osteoporosis, a skeletal disease characterized by compromised bone strength and increased risk of fracture,
affects 10 million older adults in the United States. Approximately 50% of postmenopausal women and 25% of
white men over age 60 will experience an osteoporotic fracture in their lifetimes, and the morbidity, mortality,
and costs are high and projected to increase with the aging of the U.S. population. There are many effective
pharmacological treatment options for osteoporosis, which broadly fall into categories of antiresorptive agents
that inhibit bone breakdown and anabolic agents that build bone. However, individual osteoporosis
therapies are not recommended for indefinite use, although osteoporosis is a chronic disease that
requires long-term management to maintain reduced risk of fragility fracture. Thus, treatment of
osteoporosis over the lifetime involves transitions between agents. Sequential use of osteoporosis
medications is a novel and important area of investigation that requires further examination. Additionally, the
use of combination treatment regimens with multiple medications is another important topic of interest that may
be effective and appropriate short-term therapy for some individuals with osteoporosis at particularly high
fracture risk. Currently, there is little scientific evidence to guide physicians and patients with
osteoporosis on best strategies for transitions between medications for long-term treatment, and this
has been identified as a key knowledge gap in the field by professional societies and the NIH. With the
work proposed in this application we aim to address this knowledge gap by evaluating many different long-term
treatment strategies for osteoporosis, including sequential and combination therapies, to identify the best
therapeutic approaches over the lifetime. To do so, we propose to first perform meta-analyses of clinical
studies on the efficacy of sequential and combination therapies for osteoporosis (Aim 1). Subsequently, we will
perform comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses comparing various long-term treatment strategies,
including sequential and combination therapy regimens, as well as the use of single therapeutic agents with
intermittent drug holidays, exercise therapy, and usual care (calcium and vitamin D only) for patients with
osteoporosis and different clinical characteristics (Aim 2). Our research findings will elucidate which
osteoporosis treatment strategies are most effective and cost-effective for individuals with various clinical
characteristics over the lifetime, and thus directly address one of the biggest challenges facing physicians who
treat patients with osteoporosis. This innovative investigation will help provide the framework for evidence-
based and individualized management of transitions of therapy for millions of Americans with osteoporosis."

Over 160,000 abandoned mine waste sites are concentrated in the western United States and continue to
degrade the environment with elevated heavy metals penetrating the surrounding sediment and groundwater.
The sedimentary dust and water used by communities located near abandoned uranium mine (AUM) sites
often exceeds the maximum contamination level for uranium (U, EPA max level 30 μg/L). Chronic exposure to
environmental toxins and heavy metals has been linked to intestinal inflammation, increased susceptibility to
pathogen-induced diseases, and higher incidences of colorectal cancer; all of which have been steadily
increasing in prevalence for the past 40 years. The negative effects of heavy metals on the intestinal
microbiota, barrier permeability, and inhibition of intestinal epithelial healing have been described; however,
transcriptomic changes within the intestinal epithelial cells are largely unknown. Upon ingestion, uranium is
poorly absorbed systemically (~1.5%) and thus distributed through the entire intestine, suggesting even low U
levels are sufficient to cause intestinal damage. Thus, our goals are to characterize particulate dust (referred to
as U-bearing dust, UBD) as an environmental toxicant that damages the intestinal epithelia and determine the
molecular changes that develop as a response to this injury. We have previously characterized the intestinal
mucus layer in human intestinal organoids (HIOs) under homeostasis and pathogen infected conditions, to
characterize HIOs as an intestinal pathophysiological model. Our preliminary data of HIOs exposed to UBD
found that chemical exposure negatively impacts the secretory lineage in the colon, specifically the mucus-
producing goblet cells and hormone-producing enteroendocrine cells. Thus, we hypothesize that UBD has a
direct effect on: 1) the mucosal surface, represented by a thinning mucus layer and goblet cell dysfunction
and 2) the intestinal enteroendocrine cells in the crypt. This leads to increased susceptibility to intestinal
disorders. The following Aims will address these questions in a mechanistic manner. The first aim will
determine the impact of UBD on mucus layer thinning, resulting pro-inflammatory response, and subsequent
goblet cell expansion. The second aim will examine the autophagy pathway in regulating changes in
enteroendocrine hormone secretion and the transcription factor PROX1 as the non-canonical driver of
enteroendocrine cell expansion following UBD chemical injury. There is a need to understand how heavy
metals, especially those naturally occurring as particulates, induce molecular changes in the intestinal epithelia
of exposed individuals to predispose them to intestinal disorders. Successful completion of this proposal will
help us understand the mechanistic underpinnings of environmental-induced injury that may promote colitis or
related diseases, identify potential therapeutic targets, and identify genetic variations that may contribute to
susceptibility."
10804098,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
One third of US children have overweight or obesity; children are developing obesity at higher rates than at any
other time in human history. Social determinants of health (SDoH) are strong and especially intractable risk
factors for childhood obesity, creating a structural context of stress in early life. Compared to children in high
socioeconomic status (SES) households, children in low SES households have 3-4 times higher odds of obesity
and elevated biomarkers for chronic stress (cortisol) after adjusting for individual level behaviors. Thus, studies
aimed at enhancing resilience to structural SDoH risk factors are critically important for reversing the childhood
obesity epidemic. Situated at the intersection of structural SDoH and individual behavior, outdoor preschools
present an ideal research opportunity for research to build resilience to low family SES for both the prevention
and management of childhood obesity. Rigorous research on this topic is nearly nonexistent, but its plausibility is
supported by mounting evidence that outdoor time may influence biological causes of childhood obesity.
Specifically, imbalance in microorganisms found in the digestive tract, referred to as the gut microbiome, is
associated with childhood obesity. Environmental factors strongly affect gut microbiome diversity, and urban
environments reduce gut microbiome diversity by limiting contact with green spaces and microbe-rich soil. Contact
with nature improves resilience and reduces stress in children; neighborhoods with lower household income often
lack access to parks and green spaces, exacerbating existing inequities. Thus, the gut microbiome, may be an
especially informative marker of the effectiveness of outdoor preschools for enhancing biological resilience to
obesogenic SDoH. No study in any population has longitudinally characterized gut microbiome diversity with
obesity in early childhood, nor has the interaction of stress and gut microbial diversity been evaluated. In this
application, “Childhood Obesity: the role of the gut Microbiome, outdoor Time, and Stress” we will conduct a
longitudinal natural experiment evaluating the impact of a novel outdoor preschool model on gut microbial diversity
and stress biomarkers, and the association with obesity. We will partner with Tiny Trees, an entirely outdoor
preschool in Seattle, WA, and the largest outdoor preschool in the US. Tiny Trees reserves 50% of enrollment
spots for families eligible for free/reduced tuition. We will recruit 300 children 3-5 years of age; 150 attending Tiny
Trees and 150 from the Tiny Trees waitlist attending an indoor preschool that provides tuition assistance to income
eligible families. To maximize sample size and statistical power, we will analyze ~400 stool samples collected using
an identical protocol and population as part of Dr. Fyfe-Johnson’s K01. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) estimate the
effect of an outdoor preschool model on gut microbiome diversity, stress biomarkers, and body mass index,
2) evaluate gut microbiome diversity as a mediator on BMI and SDoH as a potential modifier of effects on
primary outcomes, and 3) conduct cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses of the outdoor preschool model
to assess the return on investment for childhood obesity prevention."

For this K99/R00, I will specifically address the role of anxiety and anatomical sex on Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
progression, specifically memory loss. AD, a debilitating neurodegenerative and mental disorder, stands alone
as one of the ten leading causes of death in the United States that cannot be prevented, slowed, or cured.
Furthermore, neuropsychiatric disturbances, such as depression and anxiety, are observed in 90% of AD
patients and are frequent in those at risk for AD. Although most AD studies have been performed using male
mice, recent evidence suggests that females are more susceptible to depression, anxiety, and AD when
compared to males. In fact, two-thirds of AD patients are women. Here, we aim to identify the neural
ensembles linking anxiety and memory loss following AD progression by utilizing behavioral studies,
optogenetics, whole-brain microscopy, and in vivo Ca2+ imaging in female and male mice. These studies
represent a number of firsts in the AD field: 1) the first to test the controversial hypothesis that anxiety can be a
predictor of AD in females; 2) the first to investigate sex differences across the whole brain as the disease
progresses; 3) the first to use in vivo Ca2+ imaging to tag an individual memory and asses neuronal activity
during behavior in AD mice; and 4) the first to test the therapeutic potential of targeting neural correlates of
memory and anxiety in AD mice. In Aim 1, behavioral differences will be correlate anxiety-like behavior with
memory loss across numerous ages as AD progresses. In Aim 2, the individual neurons corresponding to a
memory will be investigated by utilizing a transgenic line, the ArcCreERT2 mice bred with an AD line (APP/PS1).
This mouse line allows for the indelible labeling of cells expressing the immediate early gene (IEG) Arc/Arg3.1
and allows for a comparison between the cells that are activated during the encoding of an experience and
those that are activated during the retrieval of the corresponding memory. We will use whole brain imaging to
find novel brain regions of interest that are altered during AD. In Aim 3, I will rescue impaired neural networks
in AD x ArcCreERT2 mice using optogenetic stimulation in combination with in vivo Ca2+ imaging. The outcome
of this targeted rescue will provide direct evidence that disrupted neural ensembles results in the cognitive
decline and anxiety-like behavior observed in female AD mice. My overall career goal is to lead an
independent research group examining the underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration and to determine
how sex impacts disease progression with the long-term goal of creating personalized therapeutics. This
K99/R00 will thus provide me protected time and mentorship to acquire the technical and conceptual skills to
successfully achieve my career goals and establish an independent research program geared towards
answering clinically driven research questions in the area of neurodegenerative diseases."

Today’s children spend an average of seven hours a day engaging with different types of Screen Media Activity
(SMA), such as social media use, video gaming, watching TV or videos, and communicating with their peers.
Mixed findings from small studies in adolescents and adults suggest that SMA is related to psychopathology,
emotional regulation, and cognition. Importantly, there’s a lack of large longitudinal studies addressing if these
effects are consequences of SMA or explaining how different types of SMA may impact child physical, emotional,
cognitive and neural development. For example, do TV watching and video gaming have similar impact(s), if
any, on children’s mental health and brain development? To address these matters, we propose to take
advantage of the world’s largest multi-modal longitudinal neuroimaging dataset, the ABCD multi-site study, a
landmark study following 11,880 demographically diverse children from ages 10 to 20 and is orders of magnitude
larger than most neuroimaging studies. Our long-term goal is to advance understanding of how SMA combines
with environment and polygenic variance to impact a broad range of outcomes such as child neurodevelopment,
mental health, and cognitive function. The objective here is to identify the specific impact of active (e.g., video
gaming), passive (e.g., watching TV and videos) and mixed (video chatting, social media use, texting) SMA types
on mental health and neurocognition, and (2) identify probable causal mechanisms involving SMA with respect
to moderating and potentially modifiable factors against detrimental effects of SMA. Our methodology includes
applying robust non-parametric approaches and using twin studies and sophisticated analytic methods such as
cross-lagged panels and Bayesian networks to identify probable causal mechanisms involving SMA across four
ABCD data time points ranging from ages 9-10 to 15-16. We also propose using predictive machine learning
models to publicly predict SMA outcomes in not-yet-gathered data from the ABCD release at age 18. The results
of this proposal will not only be descriptive of the impacts of types of SMA, but will also be prescriptive, enabling
practitioners to better understand the risks of various behaviors, as well as to enable the design of better
interventions to mitigate or prevent the worst outcomes of SMA."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains one of the most difficult-to-treat malignancies, with most patients
receiving decades old chemotherapy agents and experiencing relapse and/or refractory disease. Finally,
targeted therapies are making their way into the treatment of AML, and we are focused on developing a targeted
therapy for t(8;21) AML.
The most common translocation in AML, t(8;21), generates a chimeric transcription factor (TF), AML1-ETO (AE),
that is oncogenic and possesses both transcriptional activating and repressing effects on its target genes. AE
dominantly inhibits AML1 (aka RUNX1) and has many functional attributes not present in the wild type AML1 or
ETO proteins. We linked the ability of AE to promote hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal to its ability to
activate gene expression, and its ability to block myeloid differentiation to its ability to repress gene expression.
The p300 dependent acetylation of AE on lysine 43 (K43)1 enables AE to interact with the bromodomain of
TAF12, leading to activation of gene expression, enhanced stem cell self-renewal and the proliferation of AE-
driven AML. Given the inherent difficulties of targeting AE directly, we have been targeting its required co-factors
with p300/CBP inhibitors and Taf1 bromodomain inhibitors. More recently we have implicated the ETV6
repressor protein and the chromatin-associated signaling molecule Rac1 in gene repression by AE. We
hypothesize that targeting gene activation, gene repression and the signaling pathways (such as AKT) activated
by AE will lead to the development of effective targeted therapy for AE+ AML.
To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1. Determine how the interaction of AE
with TAF1 affects AE-mediated gene activation, HSPC biology, and AE-driven leukemogenesis. Aim 2.
Determine how Rac1/ETV6 functions in AE-mediated gene repression and leukemogenesis. Aim 3.
Determine how the targeting of AE-driven gene activation and gene repression, alone or in combination
with the targeting of signaling pathways that are activated by AE or Rac1, affect the growth of AE+ AML.
We will focus on the AE-TAF1 complex that promotes gene activation, HSPC self-renewal and leukemogenesis,
and on the regulation of ETV6 and ETV6/AE-bound enhancer function by Rac1 that affects the ability of AE to
impair differentiation and drive leukemia. We will also test treatment strategies using inhibitors for p300/CBP,
TAF1, Rac1 and ETV6 in the initiation and maintenance of AE+ AML. The studies detailed in this proposal
will define critical molecular events that underlie AE-driven leukemia, and hasten the development of
novel, targeted therapeutic strategies."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition with limited treatment options. Because late-stage CKD
is progressive and irreversible, molecular research to better understand the etiology of CKD progression and
identify novel therapeutic targets is critically needed to improve clinical outcomes. Mitochondria play an
important role in regulating kidney function, supporting the high energy demands of this end-organ.
Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN), a quantitative indicator of mitochondrial function, has been
associated with the incidence of CKD. Our recently published data (CJASN 2022; 17: 966-975) further showed
that lower baseline mtDNA-CN is associated with risk of CKD progression. However, longitudinal studies, with
repeated measures of mtDNA-CN, have never been conducted in a CKD setting. Such research is needed to
1) evaluate whether mtDNA-CN decline predicts kidney function decline and 2) delineate its upstream
determinants and downstream mechanisms. Kidney function may also be influenced by mtDNA quality, which
can be assessed as mtDNA heteroplasmy (mtDNA-Het). mtDNA-Het reflects the presence of both mutant and
wild-type mtDNA copies. In the only study to examine the association of mtDNA-Het with CKD progression, our
pilot work targeting mutations at 25 random mtDNA markers showed that CKD patients with mtDNA-Het had a
significant 2.4-fold higher hazard of CKD progression than those without mtDNA-Het. Sequencing of the entire
mtDNA genome (16,569 markers) is needed to fully characterize the role of mtDNA-Het in CKD progression.
Overall, our preliminary findings provide strong premise for our main hypothesis: mtDNA quality and quantity
associate with CKD progression through known and novel CKD related risk factors. To characterize the role of
mtDNA quality and quantity in CKD progression, we propose to measure mtDNA-Het at baseline and
mtDNA-CN at baseline and 3- and 6-years of follow-up among 5,499 participants of the Chronic Renal
Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC). The stringently ascertained CKD progression events and annually assessed data
on clinical and molecular biomarkers in CRIC will allow us to assess the contribution of baseline mtDNA-Het
(Aim 1) and mtDNA-CN changes (Aim 2) to CKD progression; delineate downstream mechanisms of mtDNA-
Het and mtDNA-CN (Aim 3); and discover unique upstream determinants of mtDNA-CN decline (Aim 4) in a
CKD setting. We will replicate CRIC findings among 3,498 CKD patients of the Trans-Omics for Precision
Medicine program. The proposed work represents the first study to examine the role of mtDNA-Het in CKD
progression and the first longitudinal study of mtDNA-CN decline in a CKD setting. Innovative methods,
including state-of-the-art mtDNA variant calling pipeline to account for the circular nature of mtDNA and cross-
lagged panel modeling to delineate causal directions, will be employed. Since mtDNA-CN and mtDNA-Het are
modifiable, our findings have potential to not only reveal novel mechanisms of CKD progression but provide
evidence-based targets for the development of new therapeutics to prevent and reverse CKD progression."

anxious misery subtypes (Aim 3) distinguished by brain network IDP profiles and symptom and cognitive
measures. Both data-driven analysis approaches will be applied to determine similarities of brain network-
symptom/cognitive dimensions and subtypes across adolescent and adults and their influence on antidepressant
treatment outcomes. Our preliminary data suggest these methods will advance our understanding of the links
between brain network dysfunction and specific psychopathology across age and in relation to antidepressant
response well beyond DSM diagnoses.
Public Health Significance: Successful completion of this project will deconstruct and validate the natural
heterogeneity of brain circuit alterations underlying transdiagnostic anxious misery disorders. The resulting brain-
clinical phenotypes will yield a robust set of dimensional and subtype targets for future clinical and mechanistic
investigations of heterogeneity in anxious misery disorders across the lifespan. These phenotypes can also be
used to inform precision medicine approaches to individualizing mechanistic and novel treatment studies."
10802854,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease caused by the destruction of pancreatic beta cells in
the islets of Langerhans. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) have implicated several dozen genes in
T1D, but few are expressed by or unique to beta cells. We hypothesize that a combination of genetic and
environmental factors contributes to immune and exocrine-endocrine crosstalk leading to the loss of beta cell
mass. In this multidisciplinary study, we will investigate the relationship between pancreatic tissue types,
inflammation, and genotypes to uncover new insights into the initiating events of T1D. We will generate
immune cells and pancreatic exocrine and endocrine organoids with induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells
derived from patients with T1D to produce a reproducible platform for our proposed study. Specific Aim 1 will
delineate transcriptional and chromatin accessibility changes of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine tissues
under inflammation with T1D-risk variants to identify T1D cell type-specific regulatory programs. Specific Aim 2
will determine changes in pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function on immune responses with T1D-risk
variants. Specific Aim 3 will establish a microcontact printing co-culture system of pancreatic exocrine and
endocrine tissue to investigate tissue interactions in the context of stress with T1D-risk variants. The multi-
tissue assemblies will be evaluated with spatial transcriptomics to identify the relationship between tissue
cross-talk and transcriptional identity. Successful completion of this study will provide a better understanding of
the relationship between pancreatic exocrine and endocrine cells in the context of defined genotypes and
environmental factors in the development of T1D. The data and novel co-culture platform generated in this
study will benefit the T1D community."
10784865,"Mycosis Fungoides (MF) is a clonal disorder of skin-resident memory T cells and is the most common
form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). In the early stages of MF, T cells reside primarily in the skin
and only a few circulate in peripheral blood. However, in a significant number of patients the disease
progresses within 10 years with tumor cells spreading to other sites of the body leading to a fatal outcome.
Diagnosis of MF is difficult to establish, especially in the early stages because the symptoms and
histologic features mimic other benign inflammatory dermatoses and specific markers for malignant
lymphocytes are lacking; consequently, MF may be misdiagnosed and treated inappropriately resulting
in poorer clinical outcomes. We have recently shown that malignant T lymphocytes from early- and
advanced-stage MF skin lesions produce high levels of cytokine IL-13 and, significantly, that they also
express the IL-13-specific receptor IL-13Ra1, unlike healthy human T cells. Further, we demonstrated
that IL-13 acts as an autocrine factor for tumor lymphocytes and implicated IL-13 signaling via IL-13Rα1
and the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-6 (STAT-6). Based on these results, our central
hypothesis is that IL-13Rα1 expression by malignant T lymphocytes in early-stage MF skin lesions
is a prospective marker for the early diagnosis of MF. In this proposal we will test our hypothesis by
investigating the correlation between IL-1Rα1 expression, T cell malignancy and patient characterization.
We will employ Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) to measure
immunophenotypes and transcriptomes simultaneously
in thousands of individual cells from
a large
heterogeneous population such as a patient biopsy. Parallel high-resolution profiling of the T cell immune
repertoire will identify the expanded malignant T cell clones directly in MF patient skin samples. We aim
to identify IL-13-specific pathways in malignant IL-13Rα1+ T cells from early-stage MF skin lesions by
comparison with adjacent unaffected skin, healthy control skin, and skin affected by benign inflammatory
dermatosis. In a second focus, multicolor immunohistochemical methods will be used on banked
samples from the PROCLIPI repository to assess expression of IL13Rα1 by T cells for a
retrospective correlation with the associated clinical data obtained longitudinally over the years. This
work will reveal the association between IL13Rα1 expression by T cells and MF tumorigenesis and
progression. Successful completion will provide a framework for evaluating IL13Rα1 as a candidate
biomarker that may be developed into a diagnostic test based on multicolor immunohisto-
chemistry/immunofluorescence that would be suitable for the clinical setting."
10785281,"Project Summary
Inappropriate accumulation of calcium phosphate salts in cardiac valve and vasculature, also known as vascular
calcification (VC), is increased with age, specific genetic disorders, coronary artery disease, valve disease,
diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Calcification of these normally compliant organs has severe impacts on
hemodynamics and cardiovascular function due to increased stiffness and/or tendency to rupture. There are
currently no pharmacological therapies approved to directly prevent or treat VC despite the recognized
deleterious effects of calcification in blood vessels and valves. Over the last 20 years paradigm-shifting studies
have revealed some of the key genetic pathways, cell types and pathobiological processes that control the
initiation and progression of VC These studies indicate that rather than a degenerative, untreatable inevitability,
VC is a regulated and potentially modifiable process. The challenge is to understand which pathobiological
processes predominate under specific disease conditions, and the critical upstream and downstream signaling
pathways regulating them in order to identify biomarkers and target for therapeutic development. The overall
goal of my research is to generate new scientific knowledge regarding the pathobiological mechanisms at play
in diabetes and chronic kidney disease, highly prevalent diseases with extremely high risk for VC and its
complications. We will continue to use a human first approach to identify key risk factors that may play a
causative role in VC, and mechanistic studies in animal models, organoids, and cell culture experiments to
identify key signaling pathways involved. The proposed studies will facilitate identification of biomarkers,
therapeutic targets and therapies to treat this silent killer and improve human health."
10785565,"ABSTRACT
 Melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) is a deadly, poorly understood consequence of melanoma for which
patients need improved treatment options. In integrating proteomics and transcriptomics data from independent
patient cohorts, CNDP1 was identified as a commonly upregulated gene in MBM. CNDP1, or carnosine
dipeptidase-1, cleaves carnosine into its component amino acids L-histidine and ß-alanine. Carnosine is
abundant in muscle, liver, and in the brain, where it exerts neuroprotective effects5. While carnosine itself is
thought to exert anti-tumorigenic effects, the role of CNDP1 in cancer remains vastly unknown.
 To probe the functional role of CNDP1 in MBM, we assessed the effects of CNDP1 depletion in MBM in
vitro and in vivo. Constitutive CNDP1 silencing reduced melanoma cells’ ability to colonize the brain parenchyma,
and inducible suppression impaired growth of established MBMs in preclinical mouse models. Mechanistically,
our preliminary studies suggest that, in addition to carnosine cleavage, CNDP1 may regulate cellular amino acid
pools, aminoacyl-tRNA availability and protein translation, particularly of mitochondrial proteins. Our findings
suggest the possibility that higher CNDP1 levels allow melanoma cells to withstand high carnosine levels and
oxidative stress during brain metastasis.
 This proposal aims to: 1) solidify the value and specificity of CNDP1 as a novel MBM target, using
preclinical models and genetic and pharmacological approaches, and 2) dissect its mechanism(s) of action."
10785635,"The NIH Precision Medicine Initiative was launched in 2015 with the goal of improving disease treatment and
prevention based on understanding of genes, environment, and lifestyle. As a first step towards this goal,
genome-wide association studies (GWAS), funded in part by the NIH, have identified 127 genes associated
with risk for developing primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) across multiple ancestries. However, this has
not yet translated into personalized approaches for disease diagnosis, risk stratification, monitoring or
treatment of this common, blinding disease. This proposal describes a 5-year training program for a clinician-
scientist to develop a career focused on leveraging understanding of the genetic basis of glaucoma to optimize
clinical care for afflicted individuals. I am well-suited to tackle this important unmet need. I have a strong
research background in glaucoma genetics and continued this work under the mentorship of Dr. Janey Wiggs
during my glaucoma fellowship at Mass. Eye and Ear. Our preliminary data demonstrate that POAG patients
with high mitochondrial genetic risk scores have higher mean treated intraocular pressure (IOP) and markedly
increased prevalence of paracentral field loss compared to patients with low mitochondrial genetic risk. These
results suggest that POAG driven by mitochondrial risk variants may represent a distinct disease subtype with
specific clinical features. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown and deep clinical
phenotyping is also warranted. In Aim 1, we will investigate the extent that individuals with high mitochondrial
pathway-specific polygenic risk scores (PRSs) display elevated IOP, retinal mitochondrial dysfunction, distinct
visual field loss patterns on archetypal analysis and greater susceptibility to environmental toxins that impact
mitochondrial function. In Aim 2, we will characterize the functional impact of mitochondrial gene variants using
disease-relevant primary cell strains (trabecular meshwork cells and retinal ganglion cells from human donor
eyes) and ex vivo perfusions. The proposed work is geared to lay the groundwork for tailored approaches to
disease monitoring and treatment for the subset of glaucoma driven by high mitochondrial genetic risk.
Importantly, the research aims and proposed career development plan will provide me with new skills in
statistical genetics and bioinformatics, clinical study design, deep clinical phenotyping, and functional
assessment of conventional outflow cells and retinal ganglion cells. I will have access to all resources
necessary to carry out the proposed work through Mass. Eye and Ear and the greater Harvard community. I
am fortunate to have an outstanding team of mentors with expertise in glaucoma genetics (Drs. Janey Wiggs,
Louis Pasquale, Ayellet Segre, and Jae Hee Kang), clinical data science (Dr. Tobias Elze), mitochondrial
function (Dr. James Handa), conventional aqueous outflow pathobiology (Dr. Daniel Stamer) and retinal
ganglion cell function (Dr. Donald Zack). Importantly, all members of my mentorship team are committed to my
career development and facilitating my transition to an independent, R01-funded clinician-scientist investigator."
10789868,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this proposal is to establish that the focal region of low shear stress (0-4 dyne/cm2)
immediately downstream or in the post-stenotic segment of ICAD is a marker of atherogenesis, providing a
therapeutic target for anti-inflammatory or anti-thrombotic interventions. Our central hypothesis is that post-
stenotic low shear stress associated with atherogenic endothelial pathophysiology provides a rational basis for
precision medicine of ICAD. Our preliminary data on low shear stress in these regions within SAMMPRIS
confirm the potential influential role of shear stress associated with endothelial pathophysiology recognized in
systemic atherosclerosis, yet extended to the cerebral circulation for the first time. Our three independent
specific aims leverage an ongoing, invaluable collaboration and the unmatched quality of the SAMMPRIS data
archive. The Neurovascular Imaging Research Core at UCLA will conduct the prospective experiments to
validate focal low shear stress measured on CTA CFD of MCA ICAD with detailed anatomical flow models
created from the same source images, with co-registered flow measured on 4D MRA [SA-1]. This step enables
us to use these validated flow models to directly observe flow vortices and adjacent low shear stress on particle
image velocimetry under microscopy [SA-1]. These validated MCA flow models serve as a scaffold for
endothelium, where the cell morphology, expression of VCAM-1 and platelet aggregation can be studied [SA-
2]. The clinical relevance of post-stenotic low shear stress (0-4 dyne/cm2) in these 50 MCA lesions will be
corroborated via comparison with CTA CFD of the contralateral homologous segment [SA-3]. Associations of
this clearly defined potential therapeutic target of post-stenotic low shear stress will be examined with respect
to other clinical variables and subsequent neurological outcomes in SAMMPRIS [SA-3]. These observations
will be similarly conducted across all 140 SAMMPRIS CTA CFD subjects to investigate the generalizability of
non-invasive CTA CFD in other arterial lesion sites [SA-3]. All image post-processing, CTA CFD, 4D MRA, 3D
printing and biological assays of endothelial pathophysiology will be conducted at UCLA, where we have
pioneered this workflow. The collaboration and guidance of the WASID and SAMMPRIS trial leadership is an
important element of this new approach to ICAD that employs the statistical expertise at Emory of these
landmark trials and their detailed imaging and clinical analyses. Our extensive preliminary work reflecting
collaborative expertise on a novel imaging and biological framework, coupled with intensive experience linking
the SAMMPRIS imaging and clinical datasets, provide a logical extension of knowledge on atherogenic low
shear stress into the cerebral circulation."
10789869,"Project Summary: Arousal state transitions are evoked by unexpected or aversive stimuli that change the
context of the environment. These transitions prime the brain to be more alert to sensory input and optimize
sensory processing for goal-directed behavior. VIP neurons disinhibit excitatory neurons and are known to alter
excitatory sensory processing in response to top-down or neuromodulatory input. VIP neurons activate in
response to contextual changes and their activity increases during periods of increased arousal. However, it is
unclear how changes in arousal lead to VIP activation, or indeed if VIP neurons modulate sensory processing in
an arousal-state-dependent manner. Arousal state is controlled by norepinephrine (NE) release from the locus
coeruleus (LC), which fires in response to contextual change and projects to the cortex. LC-NE signaling is a
putative mediator of VIP activation following arousal state transitions, but this mechanism has never been
experimentally addressed. In this proposal, I will use the visual cortex as a model to test the hypothesis that
arousal state transitions modify cortical sensory processing through LC-NE mediated VIP activation to optimize
context-dependent goal-directed behavior.
Excitatory neurons in the visual cortex become more selective and reliable during increased arousal states. In
Aim 1, I will examine the role of VIP neurons in mediating these and other changes in visual processing by using
dual-wavelength two-photon calcium imaging to simultaneously record excitatory and VIP neurons during
different arousal states. I will then use optotagging to examine the temporal pattern of VIP activity as it relates to
changes in visual processing. I will then test if VIP-driven changes in visual processing mirror the effects of
arousal states on visual processing using optogenetic VIP stimulation. In Aim 2, I will examine the relationship
between LC-NE and VIP activity using optotagging, LC axonal imaging, and NE imaging. I will then test if LC-
NE stimulation drives VIP activation and alters visual processing using LC axonal optogenetics in V1. In Aim 3,
I will relate these findings to goal-directed behavior using a learned visual discrimination task. I will determine if
LC axonal and VIP neuronal activity are predictive of discrimination accuracy and improved excitatory encoding.
Finally, I will optogenetically activate or inhibit VIP neurons during the task to directly measure their contribution
to arousal-driven changes in discrimination accuracy. The Sur research group at MIT is an ideal environment to
pursue the research outlined in this proposal and to receive training that will prepare me for a career as an
independent investigator. I will have the opportunity to master technologies pioneered in the Sur research group,
including next-generation dual-wavelength two-photon imaging, optotagging, quantitative analyses of behavior
and its neuronal correlates, optogenetic manipulations, and computational analysis of neuronal populations to
examine changes in sensory processing and encoding. Taken together, the research project, training plan, and
research environment create a path to future independence well suited to my career goals."

Optical imaging of Cherenkov emission from tissue during radiotherapy has been demonstrated in humans,
providing a map correlated to radiation dose within the surface tissues. In external beam radiotherapy, the signal
is optimally captured by time-gated intensified cameras, synchronized to the linear accelerator pulses, allowing
rejection of the majority of background room light, and providing real time video of each radiotherapy treatment
with standard dose rates. This discovery combined with CT and reflectance calibration has the potential to allow
accurate quantitative dose imaging in humans for the first time in the history of therapeutic radiation use. While
the imaging technology has inherent limitations to surface regions, the fact that it is a real time imaging tool and
provide visual recording of every feature of a treatment plan is revolutionary. It has the potential for a paradigm
change in how radiotherapy is documented and archived for daily reliance, quality audit and potentially
automated control of delivery. The implementation of Cherenkov imaging is significantly simpler than most
dosimetry tools, however the understanding and interpretation of the images need to be established, in order to
be clear about what is possible in imaging delivery of dose. This proposed technology developments advance
the methods for quantitative dose imaging in whole breast radiation treatment using our patented approach to
CT/reflectance calibration of Cherenkov imaging, will be advanced and tested in regular treatments. Additionally,
we will advance the ability to image patients with complex multi-field treatments, where adjacent beam fields are
matched, so that we can quantify the dose accuracy at the match lines. Another application is treatment of total
skin with electron therapy, where the field is extremely large and so imaging dosimetry makes sense. Our
preliminary data indicates that areas of chronic underexposure exist today and the optimal delivery technique
will be defined by our efforts in imaging and 3D animation & visualization of total body skin dose, developing an
optimized imaging system to identify the ideal treatment technique for patients of different body shape. Finally,
Cherenkov imaging is synergistic with scintillator imaging of dose, and this will be advanced as a related tool to
remotely quantify skin dose. Taken together, this project will advance the only way to directly image radiotherapy
dose and delivery on the patient’s tissue. The core of the project is combined technology systems, leveraging a
large installed base of cameras and national partnerships advancing this field. This technology is embryonic but
on the cusp of commercialization, where the focus of this research project being to advance the science and
methods of where it can add value to radiotherapy. The long term benefit of advancing this technology will be to
change the way in which radiotherapy incidents are observed by the therapist team and have these recorded on
a daily basis in every treatment center."
10789979,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mixed lineage leukemia is an aggressive subset of acute leukemias with poor clinical outcome and a severe
need for improved treatment options. A genetic hallmark of mixed lineage leukemia is chromosomal translocation
of the MLL gene, resulting in the formation of MLL-fusion proteins that drive leukemogenesis by mislocalizing
essential cellular epigenetic machinery. Many MLL-fusion partner proteins interact with the histone
methyltransferase Dot1L, mistargeting its activating methylation mark to developmental regulatory genes that
are native targets of MLL during development. Dot1L catalytic activity is essential for both leukemogenic
transformation and maintenance, making Dot1L inhibition one of the major strategies underlying current
therapeutic development. Defining the molecular basis of Dot1L activity is an essential step towards rational
development of Dot1L-targeted therapeutics, but our understanding of the structural and mechanistic basis for
Dot1L activity on its native nucleosome substrate is still incomplete.
Dot1L methylation of its target histone H3 lysine 79 residue is dependent on prior ubiquitylation of its nucleosome
substrate on histone H2B at lysine 120. However, the structural basis for this trans-histone crosstalk has not
been established. To elucidate the mechanistic basis for Dot1L activity on its nucleosome substrate and identify
novel strategies for Dot1L inhibition, we solved a 3.9Å cryo-EM structure of Dot1L bound to a site-specifically
ubiquitylated nucleosome, providing the first high-resolution insight into how Dot1L engages with its nucleosome
substrate and is regulated by ubiquitin. Guided by this structure, we identified residues in Dot1L essential for
both its nucleosome-specific activity and upregulation by ubiquitin. In Aim 1, we will mutate these Dot1L residues
to observe their effect on leukemia cell viability and Dot1L activity at known oncogenes. This work will define the
nucleosome-specific and ubiquitin-dependent activities of Dot1L in leukemogenesis and probe the potential of
the Dot1L-nucleosome and Dot1L-ubiquitin interfaces as therapeutic targets.
Many MLL-fusion partner proteins are also components of the super elongation complex (SEC), a large
transcriptional regulatory protein complex that promotes the elongation phase of transcription by releasing RNA
polymerase II from promoter-proximal pausing. The SEC is also essential for leukemogenic transformation in
mixed lineage leukemia, further promoting misregulation of gene expression at MLL-fusion target genes through
overactivation of transcriptional elongation. Still, the structural organization of the SEC and the influence of MLL-
fusions on SEC structure and function has not been explored. In Aim 2, I propose a complete structural and
functional characterization of the SEC to determine the mechanistic basis for SEC-driven leukemogenic
progression in the context of MLL-fusion proteins.
Together, these aims will identify novel targets along the molecular pathways driving leukemogenesis to form
the pre-clinical foundation for rational therapeutic development."
10789980,"Summary
Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for cilia formation. Defects in IFT/cilia
have been linked to cilia-related diseases. Although the roles of IFT in somatic tissues have been extensively
studied, little is known about its role in sperm flagella formation, which are specialized motile cilia with
accessory structures. Using conditional knockout (cKO) strategies, our laboratory analyzed male germ cell-
specific IFT mutant mice and discovered that all the analyzed IFTs are required for normal sperm
formation/function. Among the Ift genes, Ift25 and Ift27 hold particular interest. The two IFTs form a
heterodimer through their unique characterized structures. Although these two genes are not required for cilia
assembly in somatic cells, both are essential for sperm formation and function. Specific elimination of each of
these genes in male germ cells resulted in almost identical sterile phenotypes. Sperm from these mice were
immotile and had disorganized accessory structures, especially the fibrous sheath. Levels of testicular pro-
AKAP4, the precursor protein of AKAP4, an A-kinase anchor protein (AKAP) and significant component of the
sperm fibrous sheath, were increased; on the contrary, the mature AKAP4 was significantly reduced in
both Ift25 and Ift27 cKO mice. IFT25 associates with dynactin 4 (DCTN4), a dynein-associated protein. In
addition to IFT25, IFT27 also associates with signal peptide peptidases like 2a (SPPL2a), which functions as
a protease and is present in developing sperm flagella. The formation of mature AKAP4 was also affected in
the Sppl2a KO mice. Based on these observations, we propose the following central hypotheses: 1
) IFT25 and
IFT27 are dedicated to the movement and placement of accessory structure components critical for functional
sperm, and 2) The IFT25/IFT27 complex use specific domains to form IFT complex particles for sperm flagella
assembling. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1. To characterize the
IFT25/IFT27 complex components in the testis essential for normal sperm morphogenesis, particularly the
formation of accessory structures; 2. To investigate sperm accessory structure defects of Ift25 cKO mice
dynamically and develop an in vivo system to track the IFT25 complex trafficking in live germ cells for sperm
flagella assembly; and 3. To explore functional consequences of IFT25/27 disruption in sperm signaling. We
propose that the IFT25/IFT27 heterodimer forms a transporting complex containing SPPL2a and DCTN4
through specific domains in male germ cells for normal sperm accessory structure assembly; we expect
defects in accessory structures in the Ift25 cKO mice will occur at specific developmental steps. The dynamic
trafficking process of the IFT25 complex in live male germ cells can be tracked. We hypothesize that SPPL2a
is involved in processing pro-AKAP4 to mature into AKAP4, resulting in normal PKA signaling in mature sperm.
The proposed research will elucidate the mechanisms of the two IFT proteins in the formation of functional
sperm and
build a platform to study the roles of other IFT components in male and female reproduction.

The Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) plays
a crucial role in providing Oklahomans with access to National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and other
clinical trials, thereby helping to raise the standard of care in the State and region. At the national level, the
SCC has provided significant leadership in the design and conduct of NCTN clinical trials. In 2014, the SCC
was designated a Lead Academic Participating Site (LAPS) in the NCTN. Since that time, it has worked to
advance the following Specific Aims: (1) providing scientific leadership and coordination with NCTN
components to design and conduct NCTN clinical trials for newly developed therapies, including multi-modality
treatments, combinations of novel agents, molecularly based treatments, Precision Medicine screening, and
advanced imaging approaches; (2) effectively integrating scientific expertise and clinical trials management
capabilities at the SCC in order to activate, conduct and complete NCTN clinical trials in an efficient, timely and
compliant manner; and (3) accomplishing Aims 1 and 2 within the context of providing high-quality cancer care
and access to NCTN clinical trials for all Oklahomans, with a special emphasis on the State's underserved
populations which experience disproportionately high rates of cancer health disparities. To advance Aim 3, the
SCC utilizes patient navigators, social workers and targeted educational information to address barriers to
enrolling patients on NCTN and other clinical trials. Specifically, the SCC has implemented an innovative
American Indian (AI) Patient Navigation program to serve the Oklahoma's large AI population and promote
enrollment to NCTN and other clinical trials for this population under-represented in clinical research.
Clinical research activities at the SCC are overseen by a well-defined governance structure and supported by a
centralized Clinical Trials Office (CTO) that manages regulatory, data management, study coordination,
informatics, quality assurance, and biospecimen acquisition for all cancer clinical trials. The CTO functions as a
core resource and receives funding from a variety of sources in addition to clinical trial direct cost dollars,
allowing it to be proactive in faculty and staff education and career development, and leading to enhanced
expertise and support capabilities. The collective knowledge base and cross-training within the CTO allows for
adequate staffing and knowledge at all levels of research activity and ensures a coordinated research team
approach for clinical research. The SCC is a Main Voting Member for NRG Oncology and the Alliance for
Clinical Trials in Oncology, and it is a Full Member of SWOG and ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group. It
has worked efficiently and expeditiously with the respective Network Group operations, data management, and
statistical centers to accomplish the Specific Aims of the grant."

Circadian rhythms are biological processes a period of 24 hours driven by the circadian CLOCK-BMAL1
transcription factor that regulates diurnal variations of cellular metabolism and inflammation signaling.
Disruption of the circadian clock has been linked to cancer, but mechanisms of how the clock affects cancer
progression are not well understood. We previously shown that oncogenic MYC could disrupt the circadian
clock in cancer cells and in vivo in Drosophila and note that analysis of TCGA data indicates widespread
mutations in the circadian clock circuitry genes. To address the role of the clock heterogeneity in tumor biology,
we chose to study melanomas, which respond to immunotherapy and targeted therapy with varying degrees of
therapeutic resistance. In preliminary studies of a panel of 14 patient-derived melanoma cell lines, we found
heterogeneity in clock function and increased interferon response genes when the clock is molecularly
disrupted in engineered cells. Further we found in a mouse model of melanoma that clock disruption was
associated with accelerated tumorigenesis in immunocompetent but not immunocompromised mice. Increased
or decreased BMAL1, the central clock component, induced dedifferentiation, rendering mouse melanoma
cells immune privileged with altered chemokine expression and resistance to immunotherapy in vivo. Based
on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that functional clock heterogeneity alters cancer cell immunity and
contribute variable therapeutic responses. We propose to alter clock function through loss and gain of BMAL1
function in engineered human and mouse melanoma cell lines and determine the molecular mechanisms
underlying resistance of melanoma to anti-PD1 treatment. We will use a humanize mouse (Hu-mice) system to
study the clock-engineered human melanoma cells in vivo. These findings are expected to contribute novel
concepts of therapeutic resistance, biomarkers based on clock biology, and eventual better therapeutic
strategies."

High-throughput sequencing technology enables, among other things, experiments that produce
massive amounts of data about RNA transcripts in bacteria. These high-throughput sequencing
experiments continue to advance our understanding of bacterial transcriptomes, including
regulatory RNA genes, which pervade bacteria. However, processing the large resulting data
sets from high-throughput sequencing experiments can be a bottleneck in biological and
medical research studies, partly because existing methods are insufficient for analyzing these
data sets from bacteria.
 This project aims to develop new methods for processing high-throughput bacterial
sequencing data. A robust and user-friendly computational system will be implemented for end-
to-end analysis of high-throughput bacterial sequencing data. As part of this system, a novel
algorithm will be implemented to significantly reduce the time it takes for the most
computationally expensive stage of processing bacterial sequencing data, which is aligning
reads from sequencing experiments to a bacterial genome. While high-throughput bacterial
sequencing experiments commonly are performed on large sets of cells in bulk, recent
advances have made possible the effective use of these experiments on individual cells,
enabling greater resolution of bacterial transcriptome studies. New methods will be developed to
process high-throughput bacterial sequencing data from single-cell experiments. Further, a
computational system will be designed for systematic annotation of transcripts evinced from
bacterial sequencing data to aid biological and medical researchers in efficient and reliable
interpretation of the massive data sets. Finally, since many RNA genes in bacteria act as
regulators of other transcripts, novel approaches will be developed to identify the interactions
between these noncoding RNAs and their regulatory targets. The methods developed will be
applied and evaluated in different bacterial systems."
10805983,"Generalized deficits in motivation and impaired reward-seeking are behavioral symptoms associated
with mental health disorders. Identifying the neural signals responsible for generalized deficits in motivation
requires a task capable of examining the motivation to work for multiple reward options. While common
motivation assays can track a reduction in effort when a reward is decreased in size, these assays typically
offer a single reward option and cannot be used to study generalized deficits in motivation in a single setting.
To overcome this limitation, the lab developed a novel rodent task that simultaneously assesses the motivation
to work for two distinct rewards. In this task the effort required to earn a reward increases across trials under a
progressive ratio (PR) reinforcement schedule (Concurrent PR task). Importantly, the PR schedules for both
reward options are independent of one another. Rats were exposed to test sessions where one of the reward
options was decreased in size. Rats were categorized based on their reward seeking strategy during tests
sessions to examine how the net yield of rewards is impacted by changes in motivation. Reward ‘maximizers’
earned the same/more rewards than would be expected whereas reward ‘non-maximizers’ earned fewer
rewards than would be expected. Preliminary data illustrate that ‘non-maximizers’ decrease the motivation to
work for both reward options. The goal of this proposal is to (1) identify the neural signals responsible for
generalized motivational deficits in rats employing a ‘non-maximizer’ strategy and (2) implement rational
strategies to reverse these motivation impairments.
 Altered dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens core (NAc) could mediate these generalized deficits
in motivation since NAc dopamine facilities high-effort actions and contributes to value-based decision-making.
In preliminary studies we recorded NAc dopamine in rats trained on the Concurrent PR task. During test
sessions when one reward was decreased in size, ‘non-maximizers’ exhibited smaller dopamine responses to
both reward options relative to ‘maximizers’. The phenomenon could be explained by (1) the dopamine system
in ‘non-maximizers’ reflecting changes in the average reward size at a faster rate relative to ‘maximizers’ or (2)
‘non-maximizers’ having an intrinsically smaller reward-evoked dopamine response relative to ‘maximizers’. In
this proposal, NAc dopamine release will be recorded to determine which model (difference in updating reward
value vs intrinsic difference) accounts for the dampened reward-evoked dopamine response in ‘non-
maximizers’ (Aim 1). These findings will inform the predictions in Aim 2, where optogenetic manipulations of
reward-evoked dopamine release will be performed to identify rational strategies to reverse generalized deficits
in motivation."
10806924,"Diarrhea is one of the most frequent complaints in deployed military personnel from the United States and has
significant adverse effects on the health of service members. It was reported that 76.8 % of soldiers in Operation
Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom experienced diarrhea. Diabetes is becoming an increasing
health concern for veterans, with one in four veterans receiving care from the Department of Veterans Affairs
has diabetes. A common troublesome gastrointestinal complication of diabetes is diarrhea. Diabetic diarrhea
attains clinical significance because of its severity and refractory nature. The overall incidence of diabetic
diarrhea can reach as high as 22%. Although diarrhea is less frequent in type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM), the
frequent cause of diarrhea in T2DM is associated with drugs, including metformin, which is commonly used for
glycemic control in T2DM. Clinical Relevance to the Department of Veterans Affair is that with more than 70% of
patients in VA facilities being overweight or obese, T2DM is a major health concern. Yet the underlying cause of
diarrhea in T2DM has not been studied and there is a need to improve treatment for diabetic diarrhea. Diarrhea
is caused by altered intestinal transport of electrolytes and fluid, but the link between the aberrant electrolyte
transport and diabetic diarrhea is not established. The major Na+ absorptive mechanism in the intestine is
electroneutral NaCl absorption mediated by the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3). Inhibition of NHE3 is associated
with both enterotoxigenic and inflammatory diarrhea. Our recent study of type 1 diabetic mellitus (T1DM) showed
that NHE3 expression is downregulated in T1DM humans and mice, which helped to identify a specific ion
transporter as a cause of diabetic diarrhea for the first time. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that NHE3
expression is decreased in human diabetic tissues and db/db mice, a mouse model for T2DM. Additionally, we
have compelling evidence that metformin, a widely prescribed drug to treat T2DM, inhibits NHE3, suggesting
NHE3 dysfunction is associated with frequent diarrhea caused by metformin. Adenosine monophosphate kinase
(AMPK) is a major effector of anti-diabetic metformin, and activation of AMPK causes NHE3 inhibition,
suggesting the critical role of AMPK in NHE3 regulation by metformin. The objective of the proposed study is
determine the impact of decreased NHE3 expression and activity in diabetic diarrhea, in particular T2DM. The
central hypothesis of this proposed study is that inhibition of NHE3 by elevated PKCα is a major cause of NHE3
inhibition in T2DM, and activation of AMPK by anti-diabetic drugs such as metformin further inhibits NHE3,
contributing to diarrhea in some patients. The proposed studies designed to test this hypothesis will establish a
new paradigm that diabetic diarrhea is caused by aberrant regulation of sodium and fluid transport by NHE3. We
propose to test the hypothesis that PKCα is a major cause of reduced NHE3 activity and fluid absorption in T2DM
mice using intestinal epithelial cells and experimental models of T2DM (Aim 1). We propose to determine that
AMPK inhibits NHE3 in vitro and in vivo. We will determine the underlying mechanism of NHE3 inhibition by
AMPK by investigating signal pathways responsible NHE3 inhibition. We also plan to determine whether AMPK
activation by metformin mediates NHE3 inhibition via ubiquitination of NHE3 by using humanized mice (Aim 2).
As a pre-clinical test to improve the treatment for diabetic diarrhea, we will test the efficacy of a biologically
occurring phospholipid, lysophosphatidic acid, and probiotics in mitigating the inhibition of NHE3 (Aim 3)."
10807041,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) diseases are highly morbid energy deficiency
disorders with remarkably heterogeneous etiologies and phenotypes across all ages and systems, caused by
pathogenic variants in > 350 different genes across both genomes. No cure, FDA-approved, nor clinical trial-
validated therapies exists for RC diseases. As one-size-fits-all, single therapy is unlikely to benefit all patients,
therapeutic modeling is essential to develop precision medicines that meaningful improve health in distinct
molecular, biochemical, or clinical RC disease subtypes. Specifically, pre-clinical translational RC disease
investigations in human patient cells and simple animal models may efficiently identify potent therapeutic
leads, and specific mechanistic targets, to meaningfully improve overall health. With our unique collection of
‘matched’ nuclear gene-based RC disease model sets (for NDUFS2, NUBPL, SURF1, FBXL4, C12ORF65,
DLD) across 3 evolutionarily distinct species in C. elegans (worm, invertebrate), D. rerio (zebrafish, vertebrate),
and human patient fibroblasts in which we have validated a suite of novel methodologies, we are strongly
situated to further harness a multi-species modeling approach. Indeed, we have established a highly
productive research program in RC disease models to cross-validate multiple mechanistic insights and identify
promising new therapeutic leads for primary RC diseases. NIGMS R35 MIRA support will enable focus of this
basic and translational research program with demonstrated teaching opportunities, as built over the past 14
years by an internationally-recognized investigator, to advance precision Mitochondrial Medicine by identifying
central disease mechanisms and lead therapeutic candidates for diverse RC disease subtypes. Specifically,
this translational research program will focus on harnessing RC disease patient cell and simple animal models
to investigate key questions across 2 overarching themes. Theme 1 is Pathophysiology Investigations,
involving 4 project areas: (i) Understanding the mechanistic basis by which different organ pathophysiology
predominates in distinct RC diseases, (ii) Developing sensitive nanosensors to non-invasively quantify in vivo
mitochondrial functions, (iii) Deciphering the functional significance of novel post-translational modifications,
including N-glycosylation, of mitochondrial proteins in RC disease, and (iv) Determining which central nutrient-
sensing signaling network (NSSN) node(s), and their downstream biochemical pathways that regulate cellular
proteotoxic stress, to therapeutically target in specific RC disease subsets. Theme 2 is Therapeutic Modeling,
involving 3 project areas: (v) Recognizing the optimal nutritional therapies (macronutrients, vitamins, cofactors)
to improve health and overall function in RC disease, (vi) Harnessing translational animal and cellular models
for high-throughput drug screening and lead compound validation, to efficiently identify highly potent, safe, and
precision therapies for distinct RC disease subgroups, and (vii) Identifying whether primary RC disease
treatments will improve health in disorders with secondary (such as Trisomy 21) or acute RC dysfunction."

Sudden-onset of olfactory loss has been recognized as a common COVID-19 symptom. The mechanism of
COVID-19 related olfactory dysfunction is unknown. Whether the degree of olfactory deficit is indicative of any
long-term neurological diseases in COVID-19 has not been evaluated. Recent single-cell RNA-seq analyses
revealed that the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is not expressed by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) but
are expressed by supporting sustentacular (Sus) cells in the OE. Therefore, Sus cells may be the entry cell
type for SARS-CoV-2 in the OE. SARS-CoV-2 infection in the OE needs to be further characterized. Current
observations indicate that the viral infection is sparse and localized. Widespread olfactory receptor
downregulation has been reported under viral infection suggesting that there might be a distributed viral impact
from localized viral infection in the OE. We hypothesize that widespread Sus cell mediated inflammatory
response, triggered by SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for COVID-19 associated olfactory loss. In this study, we
will characterize inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the olfactory epithelium and identify Sus cell
specific cytokine expressions; we will established a primary Sus cell culture system to examine viral
recognition pathways and transcription factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 induced innate immune responses; we
will further determine SARS-CoV-2 infection induced olfactory sensory neuron functional deficits. Through this
study, we will gain mechanistic insight into COVID-19 associated olfactory loss."

Diverticulitis is among the most common gastrointestinal conditions leading to emergency department visits and
hospitalizations. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is usually mild and self-limiting, but about 10% of patients will
develop complications including abscess, fistula, obstruction, bleeding, or perforation, and over 20-30% will
experience at least one recurrence or ongoing gastrointestinal complaints. Although up to 50% of patients with
complicated diverticulitis require emergent surgery, there remains considerable uncertainty about whether most
other diverticulitis patients should be medically managed or offered elective segmental colectomy. Recent
guidelines recommend a personalized approach, with consideration of segmental resection according to risk for
recurrence or future complications. However, little is known about factors predisposing patients to unfavorable
outcomes. Among patients with their first episode of diverticulitis, there is a significant unmet need to identify
those at higher risk of recurrence or future complications to guide decision-making about clinical management.
Thus, I propose to apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to clinical data including natural language
processing (NLP) for narrative notes (Aim 1) and deep learning for imaging (Aim 2) in a large-scale electronic
health record (EHR) database to predict recurrence and long-term complications of diverticulitis. Building upon
findings from the first two aims, in Aim 3, I will validate the prediction model for diverticulitis recurrence in an
external EHR dataset. My overarching goal is to develop a clinical decision support tool incorporating NLP of
clinical documentation, computed tomography (CT)-based deep learning, lifestyle, and clinical factors to predict
outcomes in diverticulitis. Findings from this project will enable the utilization of comprehensive information from
EHR for diverticulitis research, advance understanding of novel predictors of long-term outcomes of diverticulitis,
and contribute to the development of a clinical prediction tool to facilitate risk stratification and guide disease
management. Through this work, I will receive formal training in using NLP for unstructured clinical notes;
developing deep learning algorithms for imaging; and modeling for clinical risk prediction. I will be
mentored/advised by an interdisciplinary team that includes Dr. Andrew Chan, a gastroenterologist and
epidemiologist with expertise in diverticulitis; Dr. Katherine Andriole, an expert in radiology imaging informatics,
deep learning, and machine learning; Dr. Ashwin Ananthakrishnan, a gastroenterologist with expertise in utilizing
NLP in EHR; Dr. Lisa Strate, a gastroenterologist with expertise in diverticular disease; Dr. Avinash
Kambadakone-Ramesh, a radiologist with expertise in abdominal imaging and advanced CT applications; and
Dr. Alisa Manning, a biostatistician with expertise in clinical research using EHR data. The outstanding training
opportunities with key leaders in their respective fields will provide me with new skills in the application of AI
methods including NLP, machine learning, and deep learning to clinical data and risk prediction modeling,
positioning me for a successful, independent career in advancing precision medicine in digestive diseases."

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms appear to be common and disabling in children and adults on the autism
spectrum. Co-occurring GI symptoms are associated with physical, mental, and behavioral health issues, and
lower quality of life. Yet, autistic children and adults face important barriers in terms of having their GI
symptoms recognized and therefore treated. The accurate and reliable measurement of GI symptoms is
essential for the timely screening and diagnosis of GI conditions in both research and clinical contexts and for
assessment of the safety and effectiveness of clinical interventions. Our prior work has demonstrated the
limitations of existing GI measures and/or the lack of information on psychometric performance of these
measures in the autistic population. Limitations of prior measures include omission of items regarding mealtime
behaviors/dietary patterns or non-verbal behavioral symptoms that may be indicators of GI distress, especially
in individuals who are minimally-speaking or have a cognitive disability. To address many of the problems with
existing GI symptom measures in the autism literature, the PI of this application developed the Autism
Gastrointestinal and Related Behaviors Inventory (GIRBI). The current version of the GIRBI is a 36-item multi-
dimensional symptom parent-report measure, designed to comprehensively characterize GI signs and
symptoms in autistic children 6-17 years, in the context of research studies. However, only a parent-version of
the pediatric measure currently exists. While some autistic individuals may have difficulties communicating
their internal GI experience to a caregiver, others can reliably report on their own symptoms. Additionally, a
version of the GIRBI for adults does not presently exist. Therefore, the proposed research will focus on the
development, refinement, and psychometric evaluation of four Autism GIRBI questionnaires (i.e., self-report
and parent-report versions of both the pediatric and the adult measures). To accomplish this, our research
team will work with community participants to generate and evaluate initial scale items for self-report and
parent-report versions of the pediatric and adult Autism GIRBI (Aim 1); and test and confirm structure,
reliability, measurement invariance, and construct and convergent validity in the whole analytic sample and
within strata of age, intellectual disability, and language level (Aim 2). We will leverage existing resources
(SPARK for Autism Research Match) to conduct a large-scale, online, nationwide study of GI symptoms in
7,000 autistic individuals 3 years of age and older (4,000 children, 3,000 adults). This proposed project is
consistent with the R21 mechanism, by further developing, refining, and evaluating a set of novel measures
that could have a major impact on GI research and ultimately support the health and well-being of autistic
children and adults."
10798319,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Fontan surgical procedure has greatly improved survival in children born with univentricular congenital heart
defects. Unfortunately, most will develop multiorgan dysfunction, and all face a progressively increasing risk of
Fontan failure and premature death. Due to an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology, Fontan failure
remains difficult to predict and treat. While the surgery creates the same fundamentally abnormal circulation and
vascular dysfunction in all patients by redirecting low-shear systemic venous blood from the heart to the lungs,
the variability in timing and presentation of Fontan failure is unexplained. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD)
modeling has been used to demonstrate that power loss across the Fontan conduit and pulmonary vasculature
is a significant but incomplete determinant of circulation performance. Although power loss is due to viscous
energy loss from shear forces in blood, prior studies have overlooked several important features of blood
viscosity, most notably its property of increasing exponentially at low shear rates (“non-Newtonian behavior”
[NNB]), such as in the Fontan circulation. The objectives of this project are to (i) elucidate the extent to which
NNB affects Fontan circulation performance in vivo; and (ii) correlate performance metrics with clinical markers
of Fontan failure. Based on published and preliminary in vitro observations, the central hypothesis is that patient-
specific variation in the NNB of blood, modulated by vascular compliance and cardiac output, determines Fontan
circulatory performance and clinical outcomes. The rationale for this proposal is that characterization of the role
of non-Newtonian viscosity in Fontan circulation pathophysiology will serve as a framework for developing
sensitive tools to screen for Fontan failure and pharmacologic therapies to prevent Fontan failure. This proposal
will harness the strengths of a multidisciplinary team from Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, University of
Southern California, University of California - Irvine, and University of Wisconsin. Using a combination of CFD
modeling, 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging, blood viscosity analysis, and exercise testing to study an
ethnically diverse cross-sectional cohort of pediatric Fontan patients, the central hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing these specific aims: (1) Determine the extent to which patient-specific differences in NNB explain
variability in Fontan circulation performance; (2) Determine the extent to which regional vascular compliance
modulates NNB; and (3) Determine the predictive value of non-Newtonian power loss on exercise capacity. The
K23 mechanism will allow the PI to complete a robust career development plan including formalized curricula in
study design, statistics, and engineering, and hands-on training in CFD modeling and 4D flow MRI. Together,
the research plan and career development activities will support the PI’s long-term goal of becoming an
independently funded physician-scientist, focusing on studying vascular biomechanics in children with congenital
heart disease in order to improve the diagnosis and management of cardiac decompensation."

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
accounts for 85% of all lung cancer cases and is generally diagnosed at advanced stages, requiring multimodal
therapy involving radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies. Despite these medical interventions, the five-
year survival rates of NSCLC patients are less than 5%, highlighting the need for innovative and more effective
strategies to treat NSCLC. Dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), such as CDK4 and CDK6, occurs
in 70% of NSCLC patients and results in aberrant cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis. Palbociclib (PD-03329,
trade name Ibrance) is the first cyclin dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor to be approved for breast cancer and
is currently investigated as a monotherapy for other solid tumors, including NSCLC. While palbociclib has shown
initial improvements in progression-free survival in a phase II clinical trial for recurrent or metastatic NSCLC
patients, over half of patients either experience adverse effects or develop resistance and disease progression
after eight weeks of treatment. Palbociclib achieves its therapeutic effect by arresting cells in G1 phase and
promoting an irreversible cell cycle arrest known as cellular senescence. Senescence was initially thought to
suppress tumorigenesis; however, growing evidence has suggested that senescent cells can paradoxically
promote tumorigenesis and cancer relapse by altering the surrounding tumor microenvironment. The use of
senolytic therapies to promote synthetic lethality may bypass the negative side effects of senescence and
enhance the efficacy of palbociclib by either driving palbociclib-treated cells towards apoptosis rather than
senescence. Through genetic screening, we identified thrombomodulin (THBD), a potent anticoagulant
endothelial receptor, as a novel senolytic target for palbociclib-induced senescence. THBD-mediated signaling
was upregulated during palbociclib-induced senescence in NSCLC cancer cell lines and served as a critical
regulator of NSCLC cell fate and survival, as inhibition of THBD signaling in NSCLC cells attenuated senescence
and promoted apoptosis. Importantly, inhibiting the activity of THBD downstream signaling by an FDA-approved
drug caused senescent NSCLC cells to apoptose under treatment of palbociclib. Built on these findings, we
propose two specific aims to fully investigate the mechanism by which THBD signaling mediates the senescent
program induced by palbociclib and validate this pathway as a target to induce synthetic lethality in palbociclib-
treated NSCLC cells both in vitro and in vivo for combinational therapy with the ultimate goal to develop
preclinical and clinical trials to improve overall NSCLC patient outcome."
10812316,"ABSTRACT
Use of telehealth has skyrocketed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-pandemic, only 60,000 of the
63 million fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries received a telehealth service each month compared to 24.5
million from March to October, 2020, with wide geographic variation in that uptake (e.g. 8.4% in South Dakota
to 47.6% in Massachusetts). This telehealth expansion comes at a time when the often-severe access issues
for rural individuals have become a focus for health policy and equity. Longer travel times for rural cancer
patients have been shown to negatively impact treatment regimens, RCT participation, and symptom
management. Multi-specialist teams are often required for comprehensive cancer care, making care
coordination in rural areas particularly challenging. These barriers have contributed to the widening gap in
cancer mortality between rural and urban patients. Measuring access to cancer care is a fundamental
component of both identifying gaps in access, as well as developing care delivery models to mitigate
disparities. Because telehealth transcends geographic proximity, it holds great promise for addressing rural
cancer care access inequities. Telehealth allows specialists to connect with geographically distant patients and
providers who otherwise would have had more restricted options for referral. With the expected persistence of
expanded telehealth following the COVID-19 pandemic, the time is now to develop new ways to measure
access to cancer care that integrate geospatial measures with telehealth and referral patterns in order to
improve equity in health care access and outcomes. Telehealth is now integral to rural cancer care in some
regions, yet where gaps are in its use and how inequities in access impact utilization and outcomes is
unknown. Only by measuring the new reality of cancer care access that includes telehealth, understanding
telehealth impacts on outcomes, and applying this evidence to “what if” scenarios/projections, can we begin to
harness and proactively direct the potential that telehealth has to reduce rural cancer disparities. This study will
take the critical and timely steps of developing measures of access nationally that incorporate telehealth,
identifying determinants of telehealth use in cancer care, testing effects of telehealth on cancer outcomes, and
analyzing the projected impact on equity in cancer care access and outcomes if telehealth use in cancer is
expanded, while considering differential effects based on the rural-urban continuum. To do this, we will use
national Medicare claims for telehealth utilization among cancer patients, Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) broadband data, and 2020 Census data for the entire U.S., to extend our prior geospatial
cancer care access work (R21CA212687) and population-based outcomes modeling with policy relevance."

Pesticides are pervasive in our environment, and have accumulated in drinking water reserves serving millions
of people worldwide, causing growing concern since the potential adverse health effects are not fully understood.
In 2017 alone, the world used about 6.8 million tons of pesticides, of which the world's largest usage is in China
and the United States. More recently it has been discovered that pesticides have strong effects on microbial
communities, extinguishing entire clades while promoting growth in others. Shifts in microbial composition have
been associated with brain development, mood and behavior suggesting a strong link between the gut and the
brain. We hypothesize that there may exist an unappreciated microbiome component to the adverse health
effects of pesticide exposure. In this proposal, we will use a comprehensive approach to identify the microbial
components of pesticide susceptibility to neurodevelopmental delay. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will investigate the
impact of prenatal exposure to 11 targeted pesticides on child neurodevelopment in a large well-defined human
Mother and Child Microbiome Cohort (MCMC) consisting of 3000 mother and child pairs. Study participants are
currently followed up regularly until the children reach 4 years of age. Comprehensive artificial intelligence
analysis of pesticide exposure and children's early neurodevelopment data will identify key pesticides that
negatively impact child development. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that prenatal exposure to pesticides can shift the
composition of the GM and subsequently lead to abnormal neurodevelopment. We will integrate the child gut
microbiome data with maternal pesticide exposure during pregnancy and child neurodevelopment data to
investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to targeted pesticides on child gut microbiome and development.
This Aim will identify specific gut bacteria or clades associated with child neurodevelopment. In Aim 3, we will
use conventional and germ-free mouse models to elucidate mechanisms by which pesticide exposure can affect
the gut microbiome and behavior. Conventionally housed pregnant mice will be exposed to pesticides and the
gut microbiome and behavior (anxiety, memory, motor performance, social interaction) will be analyzed in their
offspring. Also, germ-free mice will be colonized with specific bacteria or bacterial clades to study the causality
of the impact of the GM on behavior. The long-term implications for human health are significant – it may be
possible to increase tolerance/robustness to pesticide exposure by providing sensitive individuals with probiotics
that have select degradation pathways. Moreover, this understanding is important in order to formulate novel
preventive strategies including educating health practitioners, families, and public health providers and
organizations regarding the potential risks of environmental exposures."
10812319,"The importance of mucosal healing in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) derives from clinical data that
demonstrate it to be a predictor of remission. Unfortunately, many IBD patients remain refractory or lose
responsiveness to therapies leading to persistent mucosal ulceration. Prospective pediatric studies show that
reduced mitochondrial gene expression predict unfavorable outcomes in ulcerative colitis (UC). Consistently,
increased expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain genes has been shown to predict favorable Crohn’s
disease (CD) outcomes. Based on these results and our own data, we hypothesize that a critical driver of chronic
ulceration in IBD is the failure of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) to increase mitochondrial respiration. In studies
leading up to this submission we found that mitochondrial deficiency caused poor ulcer healing due to inadequate
crypt fissioning occurring at ulcer edges (Progress Report). These findings led us to develop a novel gold (Au)-
based drug based on the current safe and effective gold therapy for Rheumatoid arthritis (Auranofin). This new
drug, AuPhos, localizes to mitochondria where it increases mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species (mtROS) production. Induction of low levels of “endogenous” mtROS are known to promote
healthy adaptive responses in cells including anti-oxidant enzyme activities (Background). In preliminary
studies, we found that oral AuPhos 1) enhances mucosal repair in DSS colitis, 2) increases IEC mitochondrial
oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), 3) mtROS and H2O2 production in
IEC as well as 4) phosphoinositides-3 kinase (PI3K) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) signaling
with 5) improved expression of proteins that induce mitochondrial biogenesis [peroxisome proliferator activated
receptor-γ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1α) and transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM). Studies proposed in
Aim 1 interrogate mitochondrial function under baseline conditions to allow assessment of AuPhos-induced
changes in mitochondrial mass, activity (mtROS) and OCR, ATP turnover, electron transport chain (ETC) activity,
induction of adaptive responses [anti-oxidant catalase, MnSOD (superoxide dismutase) and glutathione
(reduced/oxidized)] as well as assess changes in tissue oxidant stress (4HNE, protein carbonylation,
nitrotyrosine IHC). Aim 2 will build upon these studies by evaluating AuPhos effects in TNF-stimulated small
bowel (SB) and colonic organoids from veterans (normal and IBD). Studies in 3D organoids will allow for
mechanistic testing of AuPhos-induced crypt budding and IEC gene expression. Results of Aim 2 will instruct
studies in Aim 3A that study therapeutic effects of AuPhos on IEC gene expression and crypt fissioning that
heal ulcers in DSS colitis. In Aim 3B, scRNAseq analysis of human biopsies incubated with AuPhos will allow
us to examine induction of mitochondrial gene expression in discrete IEC clusters. Proposed studies are driven
by a novel hypothesis that restoration of IEC mitochondrial respiration is a key step in mucosal healing. Together,
these “preclinical” studies with a VA-sponsored new drug (AuPhos) have the potential of transitioning this agent
to the therapy of IBD in veterans."

Abnormal lung development results in a variety of congenital respiratory diseases contributing to neonatal
morbidity and mortality. Although BMP signaling is known to be important in lung organogenesis,
understanding of BMP in lung development and pulmonary diseases is incomplete. In particular, BMP signaling
in developing lung mesenchyme has not been studied due to embryonic lethality in mice with global abrogation
of BMP pathway and the lack of genetic tools to target lung mesenchyme. Using our new Tbx4 lung enhancer-
driven loxP/Cre system, lung mesenchymal BMP receptor IA (Bmpr1a) has been specifically deleted. The
knockout mice have abnormal airway branching and cystic malformation, which resembles the pathology of
congenital pulmonary airway malformation seen in human patients. Deficiencies of airway smooth muscle cells
and subepithelial elastin fibers, abnormal mesenchymal expression of Bmp ligands, as well as airway epithelial
perturbation of Sox2-Sox9 progenitor axis are found in the cystic lungs of the Bmpr1a knockout mice. In
addition, we found that Bmpr1a-mediated Smad-independent signaling regulated airway smooth muscle cell
growth and elastin expression in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we hypothesize that mesenchymal Bmpr1a-mediated
Smad-independent signaling is essential for airway smooth muscle cell differentiation and subepithelial elastin
production as well as suppression of Bmp ligand expression. Combined disruption of these processes results
in abnormal airway development and subsequent prenatal airway cystic malformation. Two specific aims are
proposed: (1) To determine the pathogenic mechanisms by which defective mesenchymal BMP signaling
causes congenital lung malformation through disruption of the airway smooth muscle and subepithelial elastin
layer. Mesenchymal Bmpr1a will be deleted in embryonic mouse lung. The lung mesenchymal abnormality and
its contribution to airway cystic malformation will be determined from histologic structure to cellular and
molecular changes. The underlying molecular mechanisms from BMP intracellular signaling (Smad-
independent pathway) to decreased Myocd expression/SMC differentiation and deficiency of subepithelial
elastin production will then be studied using both in vivo and in vitro approaches. (2) To determine the
mechanisms by which mesenchymal deficiency of Bmpr1a indirectly results in abnormal airway epithelial
growth and overall airway abnormality. The airway epithelial abnormality resulting from mesenchymal Bmpr1a
deletion will be analyzed. The mechanisms by which mesenchymal deficiency of Bmpr1a signaling results in
abnormal mesenchymal-epithelial crosstalk through mesenchymal misexpression of Bmp ligands will be
studied. The role of the resultant airway epithelial Sox2+ progenitor deficiency and Sox9+ progenitor expansion
in contributing to the lung abnormality will also be investigated."
10812404,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious psychiatric disorder associated with significant morbidity and
mortality worldwide. There is an urgent unmet need to develop effective pharmacologic treatments for Veterans
with PTSD. The pathophysiology of PTSD is associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis and represents a potential target for therapy. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists have shown
promise for treating both PTSD and Major Depression. Glucocorticoid receptor antagonists such as mifepristone
are hypothesized to recalibrate the HPA axis through blockade of peripheral and central GR and enhance central
glucocorticoid signaling. In PTSD, enhanced central glucocorticoid signaling and normalization of HPA axis
regulation could constrain stress responsive systems, such as the sympathetic nervous system, that are
disrupted in PTSD leading to clinical improvement. A recently completed trial of mifepristone, a GR antagonist
that can modulate dysregulation of the HPA axis, demonstrated clinical benefits at 4 weeks in a sub-group of
veterans with PTSD without history of traumatic brain injury. Mifepristone also antagonizes the progesterone
receptor (PR) and has abortifacient effects, limiting its potential for widespread use. CORT108297 is a second-
generation glucocorticoid receptor antagonist which has no affinity for the PR and is proposed for a Phase IIa
clinical trial in veterans with PTSD. CORT108297 has been shown to have efficacy in preclinical CNS models,
and was well tolerated and safe in Phase I healthy volunteer studies making it a candidate for further
development. Thus, the goal will be to complete a Phase IIa proof of concept trial of CORT108297 to focus on
safety and tolerability, and obtain pilot efficacy data to inform the design of future clinical trials.
We propose a two-site parallel group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIa clinical trial to test
the efficacy and safety of CORT108297- 180mg daily for 7 days for PTSD symptoms in Veterans. The key
outcome measures will be obtained at baseline, day 7, 28, and day 56. Male and female Veterans between the
ages of 18-69 who meet criteria for current full syndrome PTSD will be enrolled in a 2 site trial. Each of the two
sites will enroll 44 medically healthy male and female Veterans with chronic PTSD who will be randomized (1:1
to either a) CORT108297 or b) placebo (n=22 per condition per site) resulting in a final sample size of 88
participants over a 26-month enrollment window."
10812405,"Project Summary
Vascular endothelial cell (EC) metabolism is essential for functional endothelium, and maladapted energy use
severely affects EC health. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of cellular energy status and
homeostatic function. Our preliminary studies showed that energy stress results in spatially defined AMPK
activity at cellular organelles, which indicates that AMPK activity is compartmentalized in the cell. An emerging
AMPK substrate in the vascular endothelium is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and we have found
that the AMPK–ACE2 axis enhances EC function and is atheroprotective. SARS-CoV viruses invade the host
cells by binding the viral spike protein (S protein) to ACE2, which leads to decreased membrane ACE2 levels,
increased extracellular soluble ACE2, and increased glycolysis, thus resulting in host cell damage. In preliminary
studies, we have also found that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein deactivates the AMPK–ACE2 axis and impairs EC
function in vitro and in vivo. This impairment is likely to constitute a risk factor for the long-term effects of SARS-
CoV-2 infection or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). These preliminary findings lead to the
hypothesis that EC homeostasis is maintained via the spatiotemporal regulation of the AMPK–ACE2 axis. In
contrast, S protein entry disrupts cellular energetics in ECs, leading to dysregulated AMPK and the ensuing
ACE2 hypo-phosphorylation, which critically contributes to the COVID-19–associated EC dysfunction and PASC.
The three specific aims proposed to test this novel hypothesis are as follows: Aim 1. To investigate the
spatiotemporal regulation of AMPK in ECs under physiological [e.g., pulsatile shear stress (PS)],
pharmacological (e.g., metformin), and pathophysiological (e.g., S protein) conditions; Aim 2. To decipher the
mechanisms by which physiological, pharmacological, and pathophysiological stimuli modulate the AMPK–
ACE2 axis in ECs; Aim 3. To investigate the role of impaired AMPK–ACE2 axis in S protein-accelerated
atherosclerosis in the context of PASC. In the proposed research, we will use live cell imaging, in vitro EC biology,
and in vivo animal models to determine the role of the AMPK–ACE2 axis in endothelial health and disease.
These findings will result in otherwise missing insights into the pathophysiology of PASC, which will continue to
be a long-term consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection."

The Cleveland Clinic Cardiothoracic Collaborative Clinical Center seeks to renew its participation in the
Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN). This Linked Clinical Research Center (LCRC) will consist of a
primary site (Cleveland Clinic) linked with an affiliate site (Ochsner Clinic and Health System [Ochsner]) in New
Orleans, LA, and a Clinical and Implementation Research Skills Program (CIRSP) to enrich the skills and
knowledge of junior surgical investigators as they are trained to take on research roles in cardiothoracic surgery.
As the largest-volume cardiac surgery program in the hemisphere, we propose to augment our clinical trial
enrollment by leveraging the multiple disease-oriented centers within the Heart & Vascular Institute, which take
the Heart Team model to a new level that includes within each center a mandate of research. Not only will we
enroll patients into all clinical trials, but we will also lead Protocol Development Committees, draft manuscripts,
and develop novel statistical methods as active participants in CTSN. We further suggest that we amplify the
capacity of the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) by performing secondary analyses of trial data that will result in
additional publications from each trial. We will further develop new statistical methods for more appropriate
analysis of trial data. We propose also working with the DCC to write UG2/U24 grants for CTSN-proposed trials,
thereby increasing the number of trials CTSN can conduct. Our affiliate, Ochsner, is in the Mississippi Delta that
anchors the 11-state stroke, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and heart disease belt. Following devastating
Hurricane Katrina, it has just regained its cardiac surgery residency program, and has expanded from a single
hospital into a Health System across the Gulf Coast. Although their cardiac surgeons have not participated in
NIH-sponsored clinical trials, only industry-sponsored ones, they have sufficient infrastructure and desire to
become a contributing member of the Network, thereby expanding its capacity and diversity. We will repurpose
a successful Cleveland Clinic model for assessing, mentoring, and managing affiliate clinical programs across
the US to enhance Ochsner’s clinical trials program. Cleveland Clinic is already involved in a 5-year contract
with the National Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute to conquer diabetes along the Gulf Coast, with
activities centered in Biloxi, MS. The program involves the governments of multiple states and a large number
of stakeholders from community, industry, and academia. We will leverage this experience and that of our
Cleveland CTSA and the NIH to amplify our educational program in T4 and Implementation Science. We will
involve both our Cleveland Clinic Scholars and Ochsner Scholars in these new offerings, along with research
opportunities in our existing MS and PhD programs."

 The use of opioids for managing pain is widespread, but it is plagued by several limitations, including the
development of dependence, decreasing efficacy over time, and adverse somatic effects. Opioid use disorder
(OUD) is a growing global health problem with a market size of $4.81 billion by 2028. The current standard of
care involves using opioid replacement therapies such as methadone and buprenorphine, however, these
treatments are associated with high rates of relapse and problematic side effects.
 All opioid drugs target the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) to produce both positive therapeutic results and
negative side effects. Research conducted on the MOR has demonstrated the possibility of segregating its
downstream signaling pathways to preserve pain relief while reducing the risks of dependence. However,
achieving that goal solely by targeting MOR is challenging. EvoDenovo founders uncovered a G protein-coupled
receptor GPR139 with “anti-opioid” activity, which selectively separates the behavioral effects of opioids. This
discovery has the potential to enhance opioid pain relief while reducing dependence, making it a promising
treatment for OUD. The project aims to develop small molecule compounds to treat OUD by targeting GPR139.
Evodenovo assembled a multi-disciplinary team of wide ranging expertise in genetic neuronal models, GPCR
signaling, medicinal chemistry and opioid pharmacology to pursue the following Aims: 1) Develop drug-like small
molecule inhibitors of GPR139, 2) Optimize lead compounds for modulation of opioid effects in endogenous
neuronal systems, and 3) Perform testing of GPR139 lead compounds for opioid effects in rodents. The overall
goal of this project is to identify the most promising compounds that can effectively reduce opioid dependence
in mouse models. The following steps will involve obtaining IND designation, manufacturing, conducting clinical
trials, and ultimately gaining approval from the FDA. This will enable the commercialization of a pioneering
therapeutic solution for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD).

The objective of this cooperative agreement is to coordinate state and federal activities to achieve
effective solutions to present and future radiation control challenges. The Conference of Radiation
Control Program Directors (CRCPD), a professional organization whose membership includes
representatives of state radiation control programs and whose mission is dedicated to radiation
protection, will provide a forum for development of coordinated national radiation policy, model
regulations, guidance and procedures for the control of sources of radiation in the United States and
will coordinate the interchange of radiation protection experience among the states and between the
states, tribes and the federal government. CRCPD will establish and maintain approximately 65
committees, other working groups, and liaisons to other organizations, made up of its state and local
government members to address specific radiation control problems in the application of radiation in the
healing arts, education, and industry; the control and mitigation of radiation exposure from all sources,
including radiation in the environment and as a result of licensed activities, accidents and incidents; and
preparedness for radiological emergencies and homeland security. Work products of the committees,
with oversight by an elected Board of Directors, will include updates to the Suggested State
Regulations for Control of Radiation, protocols for evaluation of x-ray trends, practice guidelines, and
other model procedures and reports for use by state and local government agencies in maintaining
effective radiation programs.
CRCPD will also plan, facilitate, and provide travel assistance for state representatives for annual
meetings of the National Conference on Radiation Control as an opportunity for member States and
other stakeholders to convene and exchange information on radiation issues and new technologies.
The conference will include discussions, lectures, and workshops on radiation priorities as determined
by state and federal planners. CRCPD will also provide radiation protection training sessions in
conjunction with the annual meeting and at other times outside of the annual meeting, through state-
federal workshops and web-based training sessions. CRCPD will also maintain various mechanisms
for access to information for the benefit of the States and other interested parties, including: a
frequently-updated website for posting of working group products, meetings, services, and opportunities
for service, as well as a secure site for committees and state agency members to access sensitive
information; a periodic newsletter; liaison with other related organizations; broadcast e-mails for time-
sensitive information; and use of social media and video-conferencing for major concerns affecting a
majority or all of the states.

Universal firearm injury and violence prevention counseling of patients has been recommended by multiple
national organizations for over a decade, yet clinicians rarely deliver this counseling. Implementation barriers
must be addressed to effectively deliver firearm related injury prevention programs. The research team has
demonstrated success in the implementation and sustainability of alcohol screening, brief intervention and
referral to treatment protocols in two federally funded multi-site trials. The team also has expertise in clinically-
based strategies for firearm injury prevention and educational program development. We will apply our
implementation science and subject matter expertise to implement a universal firearm injury prevention
initiative in a phased approach: first at a single, urban level 1 trauma center and second at a cohort of 4 trauma
centers serving urban, suburban, and rural communities following a stepped-wedge approach. All sites have a
successful history of prior collaboration through the Johns Hopkins Clinical Research Network. Our goal is to
demonstrate best practices for trauma center-based firearm injury prevention strategies that promote safe
storage practices and reduce firearm related injury and death. This proposal, submitted in response to PAR-
23-066, will refine a feasible, comprehensive training strategy for improving the implementation of a universal
firearm injury prevention program, ACTFAST (Adopting Comprehensive Training for FireArm Safety in Trauma
centers), and then study its implementation and effectiveness. In Phase 1 we will: (Primary Aim 1) demonstrate
feasibility of a program for adoption, implementation, and maintenance of a universal firearm injury prevention
intervention within one level 1 trauma center; and (Secondary Aim 1) evaluate trauma center clinicians’ firearm
injury prevention knowledge and confidence in delivering a firearm injury prevention intervention. In Phase 2,
we aim to: (Primary Aim 2) increase the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of a universal firearm
injury prevention intervention within four participating trauma centers in Johns Hopkins Medicine and the
Clinical Research Network, an alliance of academic and community hospitals in the mid-Atlantic states;
(Primary Aim 3) assess firearm injury prevention knowledge, attitudes, and safe storage practices among
trauma patients treated within participating trauma centers; and (Secondary Aim 2) evaluate trauma center
clinicians’ firearm injury prevention knowledge and confidence in delivering a firearm injury prevention
intervention. Using the RE-AIM methodology, we will evaluate our comprehensive strategy across the domains
of adoption, implementation, and maintenance at the institutional level. We will measure clinician firearm safety
knowledge and confidence in delivering firearm prevention counseling after participation in the clinician training
program as measured by pre and post training surveys. In addition, we will collect and analyze patient data
before and after ACTFAST implementation for changes in knowledge, attitudes and, most importantly,
practices at baseline and at 2 weeks and 3 months after hospital discharge."

In an otherwise healthy individual, the feeling of urinary bladder fullness integrates two important pieces of
information: (1) urine is collecting and can be stored; and (2) the amount of urine collected has reached a point
that voiding is a necessity. While countless papers claim to identify the source(s) of bladder dysfunction, they do
so without the most basic understanding of why we feel the need to void. Interestingly, many bladder pathologies
(whether overactivity or underactivity) both present with dramatic changes in the structure and mechanical
properties of the urinary bladder wall. Changes to these properties are often assumed to be the effect, not the
cause, of bladder dysfunction. We discovered that bladder wall biomechanics inexorably connect to the
perception of bladder fullness even in healthy individuals. This proposal seeks to understand and define how the
microstructure of the bladder wall transduces changes in bladder volume to the CNS, in the absence of any
confounding pathology, and finally determine what causes the sensation of bladder fullness. Drawing on our
interdisciplinary expertise in engineering and physiology, we will use innovative tools, genetic mouse models,
and biomechanical modeling to elucidate the relationship between elasticity, viscosity, and sensory outflow.
Through these experiments, we will not only learn the relationship between bladder wall mechanics,
microstructural organization, and afferent outflow, but we will also determine how the spatial arrangement of
transient UBSM contractions influences the sensation of fullness. This represents a paradigm shift in our
understanding of how biomechanics and physiology intersect to drive mechanosensation."
10800820,"The E4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE4) is the most common genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Given
the function of apolipoproteins in the transport of lipids and cholesterol, it is believed that individuals with APOE4
have impaired lipid metabolism leading to atherosclerosis and dementia. However, the role of APOE4 on
Alzheimer's Disease and dementia remains unclear, and there are likely to be additional roles for APOE4 beyond
its putative role in lipid transport. There is emerging evidence that the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis,
which is necessary for mounting the fight-or flight stress response, may be dysregulated in individuals with the
APOE4 allele. Specifically, APOE4-carrying individuals and mice with APOE deficiency both exhibit elevated
levels of baseline stress hormones as well as pronounced stress response following exposure to stress. There
is already substantial evidence linking chronic exposure to stress and subsequent repetitive HPA axis activation
to AD. Aging, the primary risk factor for AD, can be defined as the body's lifelong effort to maintain allostasis,
which refers to the mechanism engaged by the body to maintain homeostasis during cumulative “wear and tear”
from various forms of environmental stressors. As such, the failure to achieve allostasis results in increased
“allostatic load” in the form of elevated levels of the catabolic stress hormone cortisol. Chronically elevated levels
of cortisol have long been linked to cognitive impairment and reduced brain volumes, which are the hallmark
symptoms of AD. Taken together, these studies raise the possibility that APOE deficiency may precipitate AD-
related symptoms by overstimulating the HPA axis and causing excess “wear and tear” across age. We will
explore this potential interaction between the APOE gene and the HPA axis by using mice harboring the
humanized APOE3 protective allele or the APOE4 risk allele and subjecting them to chronic stressors. We will
document their stress hormone and lipid levels and correlate them to scores on tests of learning and memory.
This will help us determine whether cortisol or lipid levels mediate the effect of APOE deficiency on cognition. To
find further evidence of HPA axis dysregulation, we will examine stable epigenetic changes in the function of
genes that are associated with the HPA axis. We will examine an epigenetic modification known as DNA
methylation that has been linked to allostatic load in mice exposed to stress hormones. Identification of these
changes in stress exposed APOE3/APOE4 mice will provide strong evidence for HPA axis dysregulation in
APOE4 mice. Finally, we will pharmacologically and genetically alter the ability of APOE4 mice to mount a stress
response. We will measure the effect of using inhibitors and modulators of two primary proteins that regulate
stress hormone signaling on learning and memory. Genes that encode these two proteins will be epigenetically
manipulated using a modified gene-editing tool to further corroborate our hypothesis. Proving our hypothesis will
not only lead to a paradigm shift in our view of the role that APOE plays in AD, but also provide novel therapeutic
strategies that are much needed for the prevention and treatment of AD."

Cleaning and disinfection (C&D) activities pose work-related asthma (WRA) risks for nurses. C&D
involves an inherent “risk-risk tradeoff”: increased C&D leading to increased WRA risks and
simultaneous decreased occupational infection risks. Our preliminary data from a risk-risk tradeoff
survey indicate that nurses are generally willing to increase infection risks to maintain lower asthma
risks, if they think they think they will recover. Translating these concerns to C&D protocol changes is
challenging due to logistical constraints and lack of awareness about asthma risks from C&D. My
long-term goal is to advance methodologies for relating tolerable occupational respiratory
disease risks to public health policy interventions. Specific training aims are proposed: 1)
Develop independent competency in designing behavioral economic surveys for studying risk
perceptions and risk tolerances of WRA, 2) Develop independent competency in conducting health
policy analyses in intervention contexts with qualitative methods, 3) Apply bioethics and public health
policy principles to risk-risk tradeoff methodologies for assessing evaluations of WRA risk and risk
perception. These training aims will be accomplished through formal coursework, involvement in the
American Thoracic Society, qualitative research and health policy trainings, and assigned readings
and discussion with mentors. The University of Arizona is an ideal environment for the proposed
training, offering opportunities for training through faculty at the Asthma & Airway Disease Research
Center and the Southwest Environmental Health Sciences Center. This training will be applied
through 3 specific research aims: 1) Administer a C&D risk-risk tradeoff survey to 1,000 nurses in the
state of Arizona to collect data for microbial risk assessments, 2) Understand barriers to C&D policy
changes in the workplace, 3) Identify, describe, and assess C&D policy options with health policy
analysis. Aim 1 will involve adaption of a current risk-risk tradeoff survey and recruitment of 1,000
registered nurses. These data will be used in a microbial risk assessment to inform the needed
frequency and intensity of C&D to achieve acceptable risks. Aim 2 will involve interviews with
registered nurses (n=40) and key informant interviews with facilities management, legal and workers’
compensation staff, occupational health specialists, and infection preventionists (n=2-3/group). Aim 3
will involve the use of a policy Delphi method (n=75). Translating risk-risk tradeoff analysis to inform
C&D policies will increase the impact of behavioral economics translation in respiratory occupational
health research. Understanding barriers to C&D protocol changes and identifying feasible policy
change strategies will inform future efforts (NHLBI R01) to quantify acceptable OA and infection risks,
including the perspectives of patients, to implement and evaluate C&D policy changes nationally."

Demographic changes in the commercially insured population following implementation of the Affordable Care
Act (ACA)—specifically improved enrollment of the near-poor and those with chronic comorbidities--may have
paradoxically magnified the problem of “underinsurance;” that is, insurance that leaves persons at high risk for
financial hardship and care gaps following illness. The central objective for this study is to understand the
extent to which commercially insured cancer patients--particularly the near-poor and those with chronic
conditions—are at risk for shortfalls in care and adverse financial outcomes. Our working hypothesis is that
underinsurance is causing gaps in care and financial hardship for a substantial proportion of vulnerable cancer
patients with commercial insurance in the post-ACA era. To address our objective and hypothesis, we will
utilize a novel person-linked, population-level database that includes: 1) Western WA SEER cancer registry
data for cancer patients diagnosed in 2009-2022; 2) WA state voter registration file data (non-cancer controls);
3) Enrollment and claims records from the state's largest commercial payers (Regence Blue Shield and
Premera Blue Cross); 4) Longitudinal financial and credit records from TransUnion; 5) Washington State
bankruptcy records and 6) Medicaid enrollment records. Using this unique database that is updated annually,
our first aim is to understand how the neighborhood characteristics, financial health, and clinical characteristics
of commercially insured cancer patients have changed following ACA implementation. Due to expanded
eligibility for commercial insurance under the ACA, we hypothesize that a greater proportion of cancer patients
diagnosed post-ACA (2015-2022) live in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, are financially
fragile (lower credit, higher debt, delinquent payments), and have more comorbidities than pre-ACA (2009-
2012) patients. Our second aim is to estimate post-ACA trends in out-of-pocket (OOP) cost exposure and
underinsurance, with emphasis on vulnerable populations. We will characterize trends and variability in OOP
exposure and risk of underinsurance for cancer patients across employer-based and ACA marketplace plans.
Our third aim is to determine the extent to which commercially insured, vulnerable cancer patients diagnosed
after implementation of the ACA experience disparities in care and outcomes compared to less vulnerable
patients. In addition, we will measure the relationship between OOP cost exposure and adverse outcomes for
each population, defined as gaps in quality of care, financial hardship, and disenrollment from commercial
insurance and/or enrollment in Medicaid following diagnosis. This unique study and ongoing collaboration with
an external, community-based multi-stakeholder advisory group will provide crucial evidence to inform clinical
and policy discussions aimed at identifying and reducing disparities in treatment and outcomes among
commercially insured cancer patients in the post-ACA era."

The structural basis for pathway-selective signaling by the µ-opioid receptor.
For many patients experiencing acute and chronic pain, opioids like codeine, morphine, and fentanyl have
improved their quality of life. Unfortunately, these benefits can be offset by dose-limiting liabilities, like addiction
and the respiratory depression responsible for opioid overdose deaths. The µ-opioid receptor (µOR) is
responsible for mediating the beneficial and adverse effects of most opioid analgesics. The µOR has complex
signaling behavior, activating six different G proteins subtypes (Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, GoA, GoB, Gz) and two arrestin
subtypes. Most of the opioid agonists currently used to treat pain activate all of these signaling pathways. Yet
there is a growing body of evidence that only a subset of these signaling pathways mediate analgesia, while a
different subset may be responsible for the adverse effects. Moreover, it is possible that the Gi/o/z subtypes
responsible for alleviating acute pain are different from the subtypes responsible for alleviating chronic pain.
We have identified several agonists that preferentially activate subsets of Gi/o/z proteins that retain analgesic
efficacy but have fewer adverse effects. The overall goal of the proposal is to determine the structural basis for
this pathway-selective G protein signaling. This information will facilitate the development of more pathway-
selective agonists. These agonists will provide useful tools for understanding the complex signaling behavior of
the µOR and the role of specific pathways in mediating the therapeutic and adverse effects of opioid agonists.
The Specific Aims of the overall proposal are:
Aim 1A. Determine the structural basis for subtype-selective signaling to Gi/o/z proteins. We will use cryo-
electron microscopy to determine structures of the µOR bound to different Gi/o/z subtypes and different
pathway selective agonists.
Aim1B. Structure-guided synthesis of novel pathway-selective µOR agonists.
Aim 2. Characterize the steady-state conformational changes in the cytoplasmic surface of the µOR stabilized
by agonists with distinct signaling profiles. We will use double electron-electron resonance (DEER)
spectroscopy to map conformational changes in the cytoplasmic surface of the µOR bound to pathway
selective and non-selective agonists.
Aim 3. Characterize the dynamics of TM6, ICL2, TM7, and the C-terminus in response to the binding of
agonists with distinct signaling profiles in the presence and absence of specific G proteins and arrestins. We
will use single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer to monitor conformational changes of these
cytoplasmic domains in real-time."

 Toxoplasmosis is a life-threatening food-borne/congenital disease that can have severe implications in
immuno-compromised children. The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that 11% of the US
population of age six years and older carry the parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Congenital and acquired
toxoplasmosis in pediatric patients are treated with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine plus leucovorin for 12
months or longer. However, no pediatric formulation of pyrimethamine is commercially available, and the high
cost of available adult products (Daraprim and generic pyrimethamine 25 mg tablet prices are $790.1 and
677.6/tablet, respectively) makes the treatment cost-prohibitive even when using a single drug, and FDA-
approved formulations of sulfadiazine have been discontinued. Currently, pharmacists compound pediatric
formulations from drug substance of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine or adult pyrimethamine tablets, but
physicians, the FDA, and NIH have raised concerns about dose accuracy, quality, stability, bioavailability,
efficacy, safety, and the consistency of extemporaneous preparations. Dose adjustment/flexibility is difficult to
achieve in solid-dosage forms, as each dose strength must be manufactured separately. However, newer
manufacturing methods such as 3D printing can be used to produce dose-tailored or flexible solid-dosage forms,
which can easily be prepared in a clinical hospital environment for pediatric use. Based on these considerations
and support for deployment at Driscoll Children’s Hospital in South Texas, the objective of this proposal is to
demonstrate the feasibility of a 3D printed dose-flexible pediatric delivery system (printlets) of three drugs (i.e.,
pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin calcium) individually and in combination in a single printlet system.
Administering these drugs as age-appropriate flexible pediatric delivery systems is expected to overcome the
limitations of adult dose manipulations for compounding in pharmacies and address a significant unmet medical
need in children. Aim I involves developing, assessing palatability, and characterizing a dose-flexible delivery
system that will meet FDA and USP requirements for drug identity, quality, purity, and stability. Aim II involves
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation in animal models and palatability evaluation in a human taste
panel. The project is expected to advance scientific knowledge regarding the feasibility and utility of a dose-
flexible delivery system using 3D printing for pediatric toxoplasmosis treatment that could be applied to other
classes of drugs where no pediatric formulation exists. Successful completion of the project will have a significant
positive impact on the realization of the delivery system in clinical use and deployment in hospitals with further
development and regulatory filing to the FDA for broader use. The PI and his team have ample experience with
the proposed studies. The PI led the FDA team of scientists and reviewers through the approval of the first and
only 3D-printed drug product (Spritam®)."

Obesity is a risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a cancer that has a dismal 5-year
survival rate due to limitations in prevention and treatment. Obesity promotes PDAC tumorigenesis and
worsens survival by increasing systemic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and chemotherapy resistance,
but the mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis in obesity are unknown. Deleting lipocalin 2 (LCN2) in obese
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of PDAC decreases inflammation in the tumor
microenvironment and increases survival. LCN2 can bind lipid ligands like fatty acids (FAs), which are
dysregulated in the plasma and adipose tissue of obese PDAC subjects. Linoleic acid can suppress pro-
inflammatory signals through several pathways, including inhibiting LCN2’s binding to matrix
metalloproteinase-9. We observe that linoleic acid was lower in the plasma and arachidonic acid levels to be
highly abundant in the adipose tissue of obese PDAC patients. Arachidonic acid can be derived from linoleic
acid and then converted into pro-inflammatory prostaglandins by the enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). We
have previously shown that inhibiting COX2 in obese PDAC GEMMS reduces PDAC. Through other metabolic
pathways, linoleic acid can be metabolized into anti-inflammatory prostaglandins. Therefore, understanding
how LCN2, linoleic acid, and COX2 function in inflammation and metabolism in obesity may help improve
prevention and treatment of PDAC. Our long-term goal is to determine how excess adiposity and inflammation
due to obesity contributes to PDAC to identify targets for novel prevention and treatment strategies.
HYPOTHESES: 1) Signaling from adipose and immune cells in obesity drives tumor development through
changes in inflammation and FA metabolism in the adipose and tumor microenvironments. 2) Targeting FA
metabolism will slow the development of obesity-associated PDAC and decrease adipose tissue inflammation.
To test our hypothesis, we propose the following aims. AIM 1: Determine the adipose tissue and immune
cell contributions of LCN2 signaling on obesity-associated PDAC. We hypothesize that increasing LCN2
signaling from excess adipose tissue and/or immune cells contributes to obesity-associated PDAC
development, progression, and growth by modulating FA metabolism and inflammation in the tumor and
adipose microenvironments. AIM 2: Determine whether targeting fatty acid metabolism inhibits obesity-
associated PDAC. We hypothesize that increasing dietary linoleic acid levels and inhibiting COX2 will
suppress tumors by modifying KRas activity and prostaglandin biosynthesis to promote anti-inflammatory
signaling in PDAC. IMPACT: We will elucidate the signaling mechanisms that underlie how changes in the
adipose tissue of obese individuals can drive the development and progression of obesity-associated PDAC.
Understanding how adipose-derived factors contribute to obesity-associated tumorigenesis will lead to novel
targets for improving PDAC prevention and treatment and provide a model for future work in other obesity-
associated cancers."

Each year, millions of patients worldwide receive open vascular reconstructions (such as bypass vein grafting)
to treat occlusive cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, post-surgery failure, primarily due to lumen-narrowing
neointimal hyperplasia (IH), occurs at unacceptably high rates leading to tremendous human and financial costs.
IH is formed primarily by the vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that undergo phenotypic transition, with
dysregulated epigenetic remodeling now recognized as a root problem. We have obtained promising data to
show that DOT1L (disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like), an epigenetic histone code writer, is a potential master
target for IH mitigation. DOT1L is upregulated in human IH tissues. Pharmacologic inhibition and molecular
silencing of DOT1L mitigated SMC phenotypic transition and abated IH in animal models. We generated SMC-
specific DOT1L knockout mice and found that the absence of DOT1L in SMCs inhibited the development of IH.
Toward translation of the basic findings with DOT1L into human applications, we designed a prototype nano-
platform called Epi^NanoPaint for sustained drug delivery that is tailored for open vascular reconstructions.
When used to deliver the DOT1L-selective inhibitor, Pinometostat, Epi^NanoPaint mitigated IH in obese Zucker
rats following vein grafting. These findings support the premise that DOT1L is a master pathogenic target that
dictates SMC phenotypic transition and IH progression. In Aim 1, we will focus on dissecting the physiology of
DOT1L in modulating SMC function associated with IH using our novel mouse models. We will also delineate
the mechanism behind the epigenetic role of DOT1L in controlling IH using a combination of epigenomic,
transcriptomic, and biochemical assays. In Aim 2, we will optimize the Epi^NanoPaint platform to achieve safe
and effective delivery of therapeutic reagents for open vascular surgery application. We will then conduct pre-
clinical studies to establish the risk-benefits of the selected Epi^NanoPaint product to treat IH using animal
models of vein grafting. This project is innovative, as it will advance understanding of DOT1L’s role as an
epigenetic determinant of IH, and also develop a therapeutic prototype conveniently suitable for open vascular
reconstructions."

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with alterations in arousal that do not respond well to
evidence-based practices. Patients with PTSD tend to fall into one of two groups in extinction training (and in
exposure therapy): 1) over-engagers, where arousal is too high; and 2) under-engagers, where patients are so
worried about becoming upset that they distract themselves from the task (which prevents learning). In this
mechanistic clinical trial, we will evaluate a strategy to augment extinction training with neuromodulation to
reduce arousal and improve extinction retention. Augmenting extinction training with continuous theta burst
stimulation (cTBS, a type of transcranial magnetic stimulation) delivered to the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) may
lead to targeted reductions in arousal. Our team has shown that the IPS is a “connectivity hub” for arousal and
that stimulating this region with TMS can reduce excessive arousal in healthy people. The goal for this R01 is to
evaluate the main effects of IPS cTBS (versus sham cTBS, a between-subject comparison) and its interaction
with extinction training (vs. neutral training) on arousal among patients with PTSD. We hypothesize that reducing
parietal hyperexcitability will help patients with PTSD to modulate arousal during extinction training—enough
arousal to ensure that they can benefit, but not too much arousal which prevents learning. These results could
translate into future opportunities for novel therapeutic targets among patients with PTSD. The specific aims are
as follows: Aim 1: To evaluate the optimal dose of IPS cTBS. H1: Attenuation of startle for IPS cTBS vs. sham
cTBS will plateau at 1200 pulses, the anticipated optimal cumulative dose. Aim 2: To compare the main effect
of IPS cTBS and its interaction with extinction training on arousal (measured by startle response). Using
a two (between group: sham vs. IPS cTBS) x 2 (within group: extinction training vs. control/neutral training)
randomized controlled design among patients with PTSD (N = 120), we will examine the potential benefit of
cTBS and extinction training on reduction in arousal. H2a: IPS cTBS will result in greater reduction in arousal
compared to sham cTBS. H2b: Participants who receive IPS cTBS will have a significantly lower difference in
retention of extinction learning vs. control/neutral training (indicative of greater retention of extinction learning)
compared to participants who receive sham cTBS. Secondary: We will test analogous hypotheses on subjective
outcomes and on cognitive outcomes and we hypothesize similar directions of effects. Aim 3: To evaluate
neural mechanisms of action of IPS cTBS + extinction training. Participants will complete a resting state
fMRI scan on tests of retention of learning experimental visits to evaluate neural changes from training. H3: We
will observe attenuated activation (relative to pre-test) of the IPS for participants who received IPS cTBS
compared to those who received sham cTBS."

I am a mid-career nephrologist, a newly promoted Professor, the holder of Arthur Stach Endowed
Professorship and the Director of Nephrology Clinical and Research Education in the Division of Nephrology at
the University of Washington (UW). I have been a NIDDK-funded physician-scientist since the completion of
my fellowship in 2010; and have an active patient-oriented research program that focuses on the intersection
of kidney and cardiovascular disease. My work encompasses epidemiological studies, mechanistic studies,
and clinical trials all focused on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification and treatment of
hypertension, heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias in patients with chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury
and kidney failure (treated with dialysis or kidney transplant). I am currently the PI of three NIH R01s, the co-
Director of the UW Nephrology NIDDK T32, co-I on two NIH U01s and the PI of two NIH administrative
supplements. One of the greatest joys and privileges of my career to date has been the opportunity to serve as
mentor. My success as a mentor is measured by my mentee’s success.
My current and previous grants have provided numerous rich opportunities for training for post-doctoral
students, residents and fellows. I have been a mentor for 24 talented individuals since 2010, including 63%
women, 50% Asian American persons, 30% persons underrepresented in medicine or science by race,
ethnicity, gender identify and family educational status. Of these, 63% of my mentees remain in academia and
continue in scholarship or research. The work of these mentees has been productive, yielding >40 first author
publications and ten NIH or foundation grants.
There is a critical need to increase mentorship for individuals from diverse backgrounds. It is well known that
advances in NIDDK-focused diseases are in crisis as fewer physician and scientists choose to pursue research
careers. In particular, diverse research teams are needed to address racism and disparities in medicine and
science. Mentorship is a critical factor cited by students for inspiring their interest in scientific careers. Locally,
the UW, located in Seattle, WA, is unique in its mission to attract trainees from across a five-state region of
Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho, who are diverse by race (including American Indian and
Pacific Islander), ethnicity, sex, gender, geography (many from rural areas), ability, LGBTQ+ and
socioeconomic status. Coupled with established outreach programs at UW and the sizable pool of post-
doctoral trainees from these diverse backgrounds, there is tremendous opportunity to cultivate the next
generation of NIDDK diverse scientists in this region. I am committed to mentoring persons from backgrounds
underrepresented in medicine and science to increase the diversity of the future NIDDK biomedical scientific
workforce. This award will provide key resources, training and professional development that will enhance my
ability to serve as an effective mentor for post-doctoral trainees from diverse backgrounds."

acquire direct-to-consumer genetic tests for intelligence, math ability, and sexual promiscuity, among others.
 Despite the growing availability of SBG data, few policies and incentives exist to consider SBG’s
downstream implications. Further, there remains a critical lack of breadth regarding who gets to define the
harms and benefits of SBG. As such, SBG engenders a host of difficult ELSI questions to be addressed by this
K01: What are the downstream implications of social and behavioral genomics as identified by a broader set of
stakeholders than ever before (i.e., SBG researchers, journal editors, journalists, members of industry, parents,
and educators)? What are stakeholders’ roles in producing, promoting, and/or mitigating the downstream
harms and benefits of SBG? How might the potential harms of SBG be mitigated against and its potential
benefits promoted? To address these questions, this proposal includes a plan of research that will achieve
three aims. Aim 1 will use in-depth, semi-structured interviews to investigate stakeholders’ (i.e., SBG
researchers, journal editors, journalists, members of industry, parents, and educators) roles in the conduct and
translation of SBG and their perspectives on the downstream harms/benefits of SBG. Aim 2 will adapt The
Ethical Matrix to determine stakeholders’ roles in producing, mitigating, and/or promoting SBG’s downstream
harms and benefits for the purpose of locating social responsibility. Finally, Aim 3 will draw upon deliberative
engagement theory and methods to design, implement, and evaluate a series of participatory sessions that
bring a selection of stakeholders interviewed in Aim 1 together to: (1) discuss (dis)agreements about Aim 1 and
2 findings; and (2) identify strategies for mitigating the harms and promoting the benefits of SBG.
 Building on Dr. Martschenko’s strong background in mixed-methods education research, policy
development, and the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of human genetics/genomics, these aims
will be achieved with a career development plan that includes required training and coursework in science,
technology, and society (STS) studies and deliberative engagement theory and methods. Dr. Martschenko’s
career development plan will also strengthen her interdisciplinary ELSI networks. The career development plan
is supported by a team of esteemed, interdisciplinary scholars at Stanford University, The Hastings Center, the
University of California, San Francisco, and the University of California, Los Angeles: Mildred K. Cho (primary
mentor), Erik Parens (co-mentor), Janet Shim (co-mentor), Julie Harris-Wai (co-mentor), Barbara Koenig

10930163,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a major public health problem and the most common cause of death
from cirrhosis in the US. ALD disproportionately impacts racial/ethnic minorities, with Hispanic and American
Indian patients having increased morbidity and mortality compared with non-Hispanic White patients. Our
understanding of these disparities is limited as most data on ALD natural history comes from Europe, while most
prognostic studies focus on either risk of developing ALD among drinkers or short-term prognosis in severe ALD.
Moreover, few studies have examined how clinicodemographic (e.g., metabolic syndrome) and social
determinants of health (SDOH) factors impact patient prognosis in established ALD. Although the association of
genetics (e.g., PNPLA3) with risk of developing ALD continues to garner interest, few studies have examined
how genetics impact ALD prognosis. My central hypothesis is that unique clinicodemographic, biologic and
SDOH factors drive differences in the prognosis and natural history of ALD among racial and ethnic groups,
including risk factors leading to progression of ALD among Hispanics and AIs. Guided by an adapted Warnecke
conceptual model, I will disentangle direct and indirect effects of clinicodemographic (e.g, Race/ethnicity),
biologic (e.g., genetics), and SDOH (e.g. barriers to care) factors on ALD prognostication through the following
specific aims in a racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort: 1) Define the role of
clinicodemographic and SDOH factors with racial and ethnic differences in ALD severity; 2) Examine the
association of genetic factors and ALD severity; 3) Derive a multilevel risk stratification model for ALD
prognostication. These data will inform the most impactful interventions to reduce disparities in ALD. The PI is a
clinical researcher and hepatologist at UT Southwestern, with a long-term vision of improving care for patients
with ALD, including tackling disparities. The proposed training plan is integrated with the research aims and
builds on his existing knowledge in clinical research whereby he will acquire new, advanced skills in advanced
quantitative analysis, health disparities, genetics, cohort building, survey methods, machine learning in risk
prediction. He has assembled an exceptionally talented interdisciplinary team of mentors with complementary
expertise: Dr. Mack Mitchell, an experienced researcher and ALD content expert; Dr. Amit Singal, a world-
renowned health services and disparities researcher; Dr. Helen Hobbs, an international expert in genetics and
liver disease; Dr. King, an expert in AUD; Dr. Zhang, an expert statistician in quantitative analyses; Dr. Kozlitina,
an expert in genetic statistics; and Dr. Sandikçi, an expert statistician in machine learning in risk prediction. The
research studies in this proposal have significant public health impact as they will fill gaps in our understanding
of the prognosis of ALD among racial/ethnic minorities. This award and training plan will provide the PI with the
protected time, training, and mentorship, to build an independently-funded research career focused on improving
ALD outcomes."

Nucleoid structuring proteins (NSPs), like the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein H-NS, bind to DNA and
transcriptionally silence genes in bacteria. DNA-binding proteins, known as anti-silencers, counter NSP-
mediated silencing leading to gene expression. These opposing processes govern DNA management and
control transcription in all bacterial cells, impacting many aspects of bacterial physiology, including virulence. In
the bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri, genes on the 230 kb virulence plasmid are silenced by H-NS and, at
37°C, are anti-silenced by VirB, a required regulator of Shigella virulence. The overarching goal of this project is
to fully understand transcriptional silencing and anti-silencing mechanisms of virulence genes in the bacterial
pathogen Shigella. Over the last project period, a three-step model of anti-silencing has been developed, in
which VirB i/ binds to its site, ii/ spreads along DNA, and iii/ causes a localized change in DNA supercoiling that
evicts or remodels proximal H-NS:DNA complexes, allowing transcription to proceed. Here, our model will be
explored further, based on our new finding that VirB specifically binds an unusual ligand, the nucleoside
triphosphate CTP, like distant relatives in the ParB superfamily. We hypothesize that “The CTP ligand of VirB is
essential for its role as an anti-silencing protein that controls Shigella virulence.” This hypothesis will be tested
using three independent aims. In Aim 1, the role of CTP in VirB:DNA interactions, that underpin VirB-dependent
anti-silencing, will be characterized using biochemical and genetic approaches with innovative elements. Based
on preliminary data, this work will likely identify which of the three mechanistic steps of anti-silencing requires
the CTP ligand. In Aim 2, CTP hydrolysis by VirB will be measured and the effect this has on VirB:DNA
interactions and anti-silencing will be characterized. While the ParB/Spo0J literature, suggests that hydrolysis of
CTP by VirB may cause a conformational change that impacts VirB:DNA interactions, structural differences
highlighted by a new VirB model (collaborator A. Iyer, NIH) make it uncertain if hydrolysis of CTP by VirB has
been retained. Finally, in Aim 3, VirB mutants with intermediate CTP binding activity will be examined to
determine the effects on Shigella virulence. Here, a novel genetic screen allowing the identification of VirB
derivatives with intermediate CTP binding activity will be used so that these VirB derivatives can then be
characterized in assays that measure Shigella virulence. This aim is likely to i/ strengthen the link between CTP
binding by VirB and Shigella virulence and may ii/ provide the first evidence that CTP pools regulate virulence
gene expression. In sum, the proposed work will bring us closer to achieving our stated long-term goal (above)
by specifically examining the role of CTP in the anti-silencing of Shigella virulence genes by VirB. Furthermore,
since the anti-silencer, VirB, is a fast-evolving member of the ParB superfamily that does not participate in DNA
segregation, this work will broaden our understanding of this superfamily; an important group of proteins that
play critical roles in many different bacteria, including those that cause human disease."

10806090,"ABSTRACT - In the United States, one in three older adults dies with or from Alzheimer's Disease and Related
ADRDs (ADRD). The Medicare Hospice Benefit is considered the gold standard for end-of-life palliative care,
offering interdisciplinary care in all settings for 52% of Medicare decedents. Yet the role of hospice for ADRD is
complex. Our research indicates half of older hospice enrollees have ADRD and home- and community-
dwelling people with ADRD who enroll in hospice have higher end-of-life care quality and lower costs than
those not enrolled. On the other hand, access to hospice is restricted to a prognosis of 6 months or less, which
for ADRD is difficult to estimate. Standard palliative care models are also not tailored for ADRD-specific needs
such as managing behavioral symptoms. Moreover, there are inequities in access to and quality of end-of-life
care for underserved populations of racial and ethnic minoritized people with ADRD. (To highlight the effect
structural racism has had in producing underserved populations, we use “minoritized”). Black, Latinx, and
Asian American people are less likely to enroll in hospice, particularly with ADRD. Efforts to reduce inequities
in hospice and palliative care are limited by a lack of understanding of how racism impacts access, quality, and
fit of hospice care for racial and ethnic minoritized people with ADRD.
We aim to address these knowledge gaps and improve hospice, palliative, and supportive care for Black,
Latinx, and Asian American people with ADRD. We will convene community and scientific advisory councils to
partner with our team in refining study design, execution, and dissemination. Our aims are: (1) To identify
Black, Latinx, and Asian American care partner definitions of high-quality ADRD end-of-life care. Interviews
with 90 people will ask about experiences with provision of hospice care and other types of supportive care,
often in home-based settings. (2) To document hospice organizational practices and policies that influence
care for racial and ethnic minoritized people with ADRD. We will conduct case studies of 24 organizations
using multiple qualitative methods, including organizational surveys, observations (including of home-based
clinical and symptom management), document analysis, and interviews with providers and staff. (3) To develop
a community-prioritized set of recommended services, clinical practices, and policies for improving hospice
care for ADRD. We will use 6 focus groups (n=30) and a 3-stage modified Delphi process (n=60) with care
partners, policy makers, clinicians and researchers with expertise in hospice, palliative care, ADRD, equity.
Knowledge gained from this proposal will facilitate the development of professional and ethics guidelines, and
policy and regulatory recommendations, to improve end-of-life care and equity in hospice care for racial and
ethnic minoritized populations with ADRD. Improving end-of-life palliative care for ADRD aligns with NIA
strategic directions for 2020-2025 to support research that improves our understanding of ADRD, informs
policy decisions, and supports the goals of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease."
10807007,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Uveal melanoma (UM) is the second most common form of melanoma and the most common primary cancer of
the eye, resulting not only in vision loss, but in metastatic death in up to half of patients. There are no effective
treatment options once the tumor metastasizes and patients usually die within a few months of diagnosis despite
systemic therapy. UMs harbor activating oncogenic mutations in GNAQ, GNA11 or CYSLTR2 that occur early
in tumor formation and that are unrelated to metastatic risk. We showed that over 80% of class 2 UMs harbor
loss of function mutations of BAP1 and that recurrent mutations altering R625 of SF3B1 are found in tumors with
slower rates of metastasis. Mutations in EIF1AX are associated with tumors with minimal chance of metastasis.
The presence of BAP1, SF3B1 and EIF1AX mutations, are nearly always mutually exclusive. However, overlaid
on this are genomic rearrangements that include gain of chromosomes 8q and 6p, and loss of chromosomes 1p,
6q and 8p. Our studies of these karyotypic/copy number alterations in UM have identified a critical chromatin
modifier mapping to chromosome 6q (PHF10) and candidate genes in other regions of recurrent chromosomal
alteration. The consequences of these changes in the development of UM are poorly understood. To extend and
refine our copy number studies we will now will perform long-read single molecule sequencing of DNA and RNA
isolated from primary UMs with different driver mutations and CNAs. In Aims 1 and 2 we will perform long-read
single molecule sequencing (SMRT) to develop detailed maps of the structural variations (SVs) of the genomes
of these tumors, identifying and characterizing critical breakpoints, gene fusions and tumor specific isoforms.
Besides obtaining insights into the generation of chromosomal alterations we will validate and refine focal
deletions and identify critical isoforms in such regions. Functional analyses in cell lines will examine the
consequences of gene fusions and isoforms highly correlated with copy number changes. In parallel and in Aim
3 we will use the power of fly genetics to investigate the consequence of major alterations in UM in D.
Melanogaster. We will first generate and characterize flies with loss of function mutations in the BAP1 ortholog
calypso, and generate activating mutations of the GNAQ ortholog GαQ so that the combined effect of loss of
calypso and activation of GαQ can be investigated. We will focus on larval eye discs and wing discs that
represented well-ordered epithelial monolayers and examine the the phenotypic, signaling and epigenomic
changes that arise from these mutations. The fly model is capable of addressing the functional relevance of the
genomic insights from all three Aims by performing rapid genetic interactions. In the future, candidate UM drivers
identified from Aims 1-2 will be tested for the ability to modify the cancer-like phenotypes we see in our two hit
GαQ and calypso fly model. Genetic suppressors of overgrowth, tissue transformation, and metastasis
phenotypes would represent exciting therapeutic candidates to pursue in future studies."

Neurotransmitters and hormones serve as a link between the nervous and immune systems. Among them,
norepinephrine and epinephrine are synthesized in the postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous
system and the adrenal medulla. Upon release, they engage the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) expressed on
immune cells. Notably, β2AR abnormal expression and gene polymorphisms are associated with several types
of autoimmune diseases. However, mechanisms by which β2AR signaling dysfunction contribute to these
diseases remain largely unknown. In this context, our studies with mouse models have uncovered previously
unappreciated major dichotomous roles of β2AR in immune development and reconstitution: 1) Under specific
pathogen free (SPF) condition, β2AR deficiency causes significantly reduced T cell development in thymus in
contrast to increased CD115+ myeloid cell development in bone marrow (BM); 2) Both thymic and myeloid
development phenotypes are remarkably more manifested during immune reconstitution following allogeneic
hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT); 3) β2AR plays differential roles in in mature peripheral T cell
subsets and myeloid cell subsets that result in different outcome in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Together,
these findings highlight the critical and fundamental role of β2AR signaling in maintaining immune homeostasis
and regulating immune response. Therefore, this study will pursue three specific aims to test an overarching
hypothesis that β2AR signaling regulates immune development and reconstitution via cross-talking with
canonical immune signaling pathways and/or fine-tuning metabolic fitness of immune cells. Aim 1 will determine
mechanisms by which β2AR signaling regulates T cell development, reconstitution and GVHD. Aim 2 will define
mechanisms by which β2AR signaling regulates CD115+ myeloid cell development, reconstitution and GVHD.
Aim 3 will study the translational potential and mechanisms of pharmacologic β2AR intervention. We will use
unbiased RNA-seq transcriptomic approach along with flow cytometry, CyTOF mass cytometry and Seahorse
metabolic assay combined with cell type-specific β2AR knockout (Cre-LoxP) to define the molecular mechanisms
for T cell and myeloid cell differentiation and function. In the setting of allo-HCT, we will also examine the impact
of these mechanisms on GVHD and GVT effect. This project will not only improve our understanding of the
fundamental mechanisms of β2AR signaling in adaptive and innate immune cells in central and peripheral
immune organs, but it may also explain how β2AR signaling contributes to immunologic disorders and allo-HCT
based immunotherapy. Therefore, this study may have important ramifications on therapeutic rationale based
upon manipulation of β2AR signaling. Since β2AR agonists and antagonists are already widely available, new
clinical trials emanating from this research could be rapidly implemented for patients receiving allo-HCT for
treatment of blood cancers, or other hematologic or immunologic diseases in which allo-HCT can be curative."

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) constitutes a spectrum of incurable, relapsing and remitting disorders driven
by intestinal mucosal barrier function defects and aberrant pro-inflammatory responses directed against
microbial flora. IBD patients are at increased risk of developing colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) but
the epithelial specific mechanisms that control it are incompletely understood. Also unclear are the genetic
factors that predict which IBD patients are likely to progress to CAC. The research focus of this proposal is to
uncover how dysregulation of a novel epithelial repair protein, Leucine rich repeat and Ig domain-containing,
nogo receptor-interacting protein family 2 (LINGO2) contributes to malignant transformation. In preliminary
data, we show that Lingo2 deficiency in epithelial cells results in up-regulation of EGFR phosphorylation,
prolonged STAT3 activation in response to IL6 treatment and increased proliferation compared to wildtype
cells. Furthermore, Lingo2 deficient mice have severe dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced colitis that is
rescued by EGFR inhibition. We demonstrate that Lingo2 is expressed in immune cells and its loss in the
hematopoietic compartment contributes to susceptibility to colitis. Consistent with the published observations
that increased EGFR signaling is pro-tumorigenic, we show that when exposed to azoxymethane (AOM) and
DSS, Lingo2 deficient mice are more susceptible to the development of CAC compared to control mice. I
therefore hypothesize that Lingo2 protects against the development of CAC through regulation of EGFR and
STAT3 activity. The objective is to first mechanistically dissect the cell autonomous role of Lingo2 in epithelial
cells in protection from CAC and then to understand whether Lingo2 deficiency in the microenvironment is
important for CAC. My hypothesis will be tested through two inter-related Specific Aims that will examine the
interplay of LINGO2 and EGFR signaling in epithelial cells in CAC (Aim 1) and then evaluate how Lingo2
deficiency affects the production of STAT3 activating cytokines and activity of myeloid cells in CAC (Aim 2).
The experiments proposed will use various innovative approaches including the use of unique knock-in murine
models, 3D organoid culture model systems and organoid orthotopic transplantation. The proposed research is
significant because it will provide new information about a novel tumor suppressive molecular pathway.
University of Pennsylvania provides the perfect research environment to conduct this investigation given local
expertise in the inter-related fields of mucosal biology, epithelial biology and immunology. The candidate will
gain fundamental skills in murine and in vitro disease modeling and broaden her immunology and epithelial
biology knowledge base. These skill sets will greatly enhance the candidate's career development into an
independent NIH funded tenure-track faculty member with the long term goal of understanding the
mechanisms that control mucosal repair and homeostasis."

The last five years have been a volatile period in South America with the massive emergence of Zika and its
congenital syndrome, the Brazil yellow fever outbreak that threatened to exhaust the regional vaccine
stockpile, the Venezuelan crisis that led to significant migration and measles outbreaks, and an unprecedented
surge in malaria cases that crippled the progress achieved in malaria control. Indeed, Peru was affected by
these challenges and suffered its largest dengue outbreak on record with nearly 70,000 cases and 89 deaths
after the sudden 2017 Coastal El Niño event. Therefore, to strengthen early detection and effective responses
to these epidemic threats, we will provide advanced Master’s and doctoral training opportunities to Ministry of
Health personnel. This will create an Epidemiology Master’s program in the Amazon Basin and strengthen our
satellite research unit on the northern coast of Peru and secure the long-term sustainability of our new
epidemiology doctorate. These strategies will result in better-trained epidemiologists in larger numbers, and
present in the critical, high-risk areas where they are needed the most. Our objective will be to consolidate and
secure a self-sustainable and cost-effective epidemiology doctorate in Peru by replicating the successful model
of our Master’s program and creating a continuous pipeline of emerging diseases epidemiologists to respond
to outbreaks and prevention and control efforts. The expected outcomes for the next five years are: 1) 20 PhDs
graduates from the Peru program and 12 more under training with a streamlined curricula to improve
graduation and research outcomes, 2) 30 graduates from a new, decentralized Epidemiology Master’s program
in Iquitos and 90 additional graduates from our Lima Master’s, ~15% conducting research in emerging
diseases and ~20% from the public sector, 3) One doctoral and five Master’s graduates of the Peruvian CDC
trained jointly with the US CDC, 4) Six highly-selected Peruvian doctorates trained in world-class programs
abroad, four reinserted in Peru in productive research careers, 5) A large pipeline of young professionals
trained and engaged in emerging diseases research via on-site internships (30) and short courses (150).
Experienced research leaders in world-class institutions such as Cayetano, San Marcos, Minas Gerais and
Johns Hopkins universities will partner with Peru and US CDC supported by a broad network of 30 local and
foreign organizations working in Peru. The partners of this program provide a unique, rich and nurturing
research environment with extensive multi-year grant funding from the NIH and other sources that promotes
innovation and addresses hypothesis of public health and scientific significance, particularly for arbovirosis,
antimicrobial resistance, respiratory infections and zoonotic diseases. Our track record demonstrates proof of
concept for the proposed goals after creating an Epidemiology Master’s and Doctorate in Peru, graduating over
200 Master’s students and sponsoring doctoral training for 16 Peruvian scientists at prestigious US and UK
universities. Almost 15% of our Master’s students have already moved into PhD training, and our first cohort
alone has published >200 papers after graduating, a four-fold increase year compared to prior coursework.
More than half of our doctoral trainees abroad have graduated and started productive scientific careers, and
overall, they have published an average of 11 manuscripts each. Current and future trainees are likely to be
even more productive due to enhanced research opportunities, improved coursework and added mentoring.

The goal of this R01 application is to develop state-of-the-art, open-source software for image-based analysis of
skeletal kinematics. Worldwide, over 250 million people are affected by musculoskeletal disorders, including
arthritis, trauma, osteoporosis, and spine pathology, a number that is projected to increase as the population
ages. The in-depth understanding of normal joint function and the changes associated with aging, injury and
disease requires the ability to quantitatively measure skeletal kinematics. The current state-of-the art for
quantifying skeletal kinematics – especially the complex motion at the joint surface, called arthrokinematics – is
image-based object tracking performed with datasets from biplane videoradiography (BVR), and static and
dynamic computed tomography (3DCT and 4DCT, respectively). Regardless of the imaging modality, image-
based skeletal tracking involves image segmentation and bone model generation, bone image registration,
coordinate system selection, and data presentation. Software and computing infrastructure are critical for
accuracy and efficiency. The lack of “industry-standard” software or templates for workflow are major obstacles
to progress in the field. Laboratories use their own combination of commercial, public-domain, and custom-
written code. The current individualized implementation model is inefficient, duplicates effort, and impedes
collaboration, and, importantly, the sharing of software and technical advances. Recent focus workshops and
surveys demonstrate clear interest in better solutions. Accordingly, based on our longstanding expertise in
image-based tracking, we will develop an open source program for image-based skeletal motion tracking capable
of accepting as input all of the commonly used imaging modalities (videoradiography, 3DCT, and 4DCT). Our
long-term objective is to build a world-wide user base of collaborators and contributors to foster innovation and
inquiry in musculoskeletal research. In our first Aim we will partner with Kitware, Inc. an experienced and
successful open-source software development company, to refine and enhance Autoscoper, and integrate it into
the 3D Slicer platform to yield SlicerAutoscoperM (SAM). Autoscoper is an existing BVR software program
developed at Brown University to semi-automatically align skeletal structures (bones and implants) to x-ray
videos. SAM will be refined with input from the project’s co-investigators and an established core user base. In
Aim 2 we will determine the agreement and accuracy of SAM by comparing its outputs to those of obtained using
legacy methods, using data from existing studies performed in four independent laboratories. Finally, in Aim 3
we will use a synthetic model to evaluate the accuracy of SAM in round-robin testing in four labs (Brown,
Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and Queens Universiyt) using image data from 3DCT, 4DCT and BVR. The work
outlined in this proposal will yield a state-of-the-art, open-source software solution that will accept datasets from
multiple imaging modalities. SAM will simplify and improve image-based skeletal tracking, facilitate the sharing
of novel analysis algorithms, methodologies, and data, and hasten the translation to clinical implementation."
10805043,"Advanced prostate cancers disproportionally affect veteran populations in the US. One
key feature of the advanced diseases is the development of anti-androgen receptor
therapy resistance through a mechanism of tumor lineage plasticity, which contributes to
the lethal progression of prostate cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying the
aberration are poorly understood, which severely hinders the development of effectively
therapeutic intervention of the advanced diseases. Our preliminary studies found that a
novel reprogramming of adrenergic receptor signaling occurs in progression to lethal
forms of prostate cancer, where beta-blocker drug target gene is silenced and, in
contrast, adrenergic ligand synthesis genes, and a different member of the adrenergic
receptor family and its signaling pathway genes are induced. In line with the change,
beta-blocker displayed no significant effect on the treatment-induced neuroendocrine
prostate cancer (t-NEPC) tumors. Remarkably, small molecule antagonists of the other
adrenergic receptor developed by us and others displayed high potency in growth
inhibition of several enzalutamide-resistant /t-NEPC cell and PDX tumor models. Our
further analyses showed that the aberrant signaling stimulates programs for cancer
stem-like cell (CSC), EMT and NEPC features, with alterations of local chromatin histone
marks. Moreover, our data suggest that a chemokine receptor appears to interact with
the adrenergic receptor and facilitate the signaling. Therefore, we will take genetics,
pharmacological, functional genomics and epigenomics approaches to test the
hypotheses that reprogramming of adrenergic receptor signaling drives tumor plasticity
and therapy resistance through cross-talks and that targeting the aberrant signaling axis
is efficacious and safe for treatment of therapy-resistant, lethal forms of PCa."

Mixed neuropathologies are the most common cause of the clinical syndrome of dementia, including Alzheimer's
disease (AD), Lewy body dementia (LBD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Exploiting novel constitutive and
conditional knockout lines as well as transgenic mouse lines, we now propose a series of genetic approaches
designed to uncover key knowledge gaps linking alpha-synuclein (αSyn) and tau biology, pathologies and their
relationships to synaptic and cognitive function. Leveraging emerging evidence from independent groups
including our own, we will test the central hypothesis that αSyn expression, independent of αSyn pathology, may
impact the biology tau and/or tau-dependent pathology. In the light of novel findings reported in the preliminary
results, we will i) test the hypothesis that αSyn regulates human tau selectively, but not mouse tau, ii) test the
prediction that constitutive ablation of the SNCA gene encoding αSyn alleviates tau pathology and tau-induced
cognitive deficits in a model of tauopathy, iii) test the hypothesis that conditional ablation of SNCA in forebrain
excitatory neurons alleviates tau pathology and tau-induced cognitive deficits in a model of tauopathy, thereby
providing a preclinical proof-of-principle that targeting this αSyn/tau coupling might be therapeutically beneficial

10810844,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project will assess the availability of the cerebral α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR) as a
contributing factor in the early pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Converging data suggest that the
α7-nAChR promotes accumulation of Aβ42 in cholinergic neurons, particularly in basal forebrain and
neocortical regions where the α7-nAChR is more highly expressed. High cerebral α7-nAChR availability (as
we have observed in normal aging), promotes intracellular sequestration of Aβ42 in cholinergic cells, and the
Aβ42-α7-nAChR interaction functionally antagonizes the α7-nAChR, which may be linked to progressive,
localized cell-death, synaptic loss, and aberrant neuronal activity long before spread of extracellular amyloid
plaque. The Aβ42-α7-nAChR complex drives upregulated expression of the α7-nAChR, fueling its further
interactions with soluble Aβ42 species. Based on published evidence and our preliminary data, we
hypothesize that higher, cerebral α7-nAChR binding will be observed in patients with MCI, the prodrome to
AD, compared to cognitively normal elderly controls using [18F]ASEM (ASEM) with positron emission
tomography (PET). We further hypothesize that higher availability of α7-nAChR in targeted brain regions will
be associated with 1. lower cognitive performance and 2. higher circulating, AD-relevant, biofluid biomarkers
such as α7-nAChR autoantibodies within these participants. We will thus test for hypothesized high
availability of the α7-nAChR in MCI compared to cognitively normal individuals, and its relationship to
cognitive performance (Aim 1), as well as its correlation with targeted biofluid markers that include plasma α7-
nAChR autoantibodies (Aim 2). Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate changes in α7-nAChR availability using
ASEM PET and its relationship to cognitive performance and these biofluid markers between baseline and
two-year follow-up in a subset of participants from Aims 1 and 2. The goal of this proposal is to test for high
brain availability of the α7-nAChR in MCI and its relationship to cognition and circulating AD-relevant
biomarkers - a critical step toward evaluating the α7-nAChR as an AD imaging biomarker with diagnostic and
therapeutic implications."

Hospitalizations for drug use-associated infective endocarditis (DUA-IE), an infection of the heart valves from
injecting drugs, have increased sharply as a consequence of the opioid epidemic. DUA-IE is a severe disease
that poses substantial morbidity to patients and burden to hospitals and insurance payers. Treatment typically
requires long hospitalizations, six weeks of intravenous antibiotics and often includes surgical heart valve
replacement. The post-hospitalization course of patients with DUA-IE has not been well-studied. During
treatment, many patients’ drug use disorders (DUDs) remain unaddressed, despite their central role in causing
DUA-IE, leaving patients vulnerable to ongoing drug-related risks such as overdose and repeat DUA-IE.
Understanding how to address DUDs for hospitalized patients with DUA-IE, particularly in areas with limited
treatment resources, is critically important. The overall objectives of this work are to characterize DUA-IE
patients’ post-discharge course to understand the scope and timing of negative clinical outcomes, and to explore
DUA-IE patients’ perspectives to identify strategies to foster engagement in DUD and infectious disease care. In
North Carolina, a Medicaid non-expansion state, we will evaluate three research aims: (1) Estimate incidence
rates of and risk factors for adverse outcomes following hospitalization for DUA-IE including: drug overdose,
readmission, reoperation, and all-cause mortality; (2) Explore knowledge, preferences, and perceptions of DUA-
IE risk, post-hospitalization drug use, DUD treatment, and antibiotic options among hospitalized DUA-IE patients;
and (3) Pilot a multicenter survey characterizing DUA-IE patients’ knowledge, preferences, and perceptions of
DUA-IE and DUD, access to care, and treatment preferences. Completion of these aims aligns with a training
objective to obtain skills across five specific domains: (1) epidemiologic analysis of administrative datasets, (2)
exploratory qualitative research, (3) developing and analyzing questionnaires, (4) collaborative, management
and project development, and (5) the responsible conduct of human subjects research. This training will be
accomplished through coursework, one-on-one instruction and guidance from a diverse group of mentors and
advisors from across the University of North Carolina, Duke University and the North Carolina Division of Public
Health, including experts in health services research for infectious diseases, DUD care, multisite studies of
infective endocarditis and behavioral health. Completion of the research and training aims represent short-term
career goals, but they will also form a foundation for my future academic endeavors. My long-term goal is to
become an independent investigator with expertise in the infectious complications of drug use, and to be
prepared to implement interventions and to answer new epidemiologic and behavioral questions that arise. This
research and training plan is foundational to the future implementation and evaluation of an inpatient intervention
to enhance post-discharge outcomes for DUA-IE, which I will propose in an R01 towards the end of the award
as I transition to research and funding independence."
10810857,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) sufficiently suppresses HIV replication to reduce plasma viral load (pVL) below the
limit of detection, but immune activation (IA) is not normalized and the elevated levels of IA markers- IL-6, TNF,
TGFß, C reactive protein (CRP), and D-Dimer remain elevated are associated with increased risk for
cardiovascular disease, endothelial disfunction and clotting abnormalities, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial
nephritis, development of non-AIDS associated malignancies, and CNS abnormalities. Multiple mechanisms
have been proposed to explain the persistence of IA under ART including microbial translocation and herpes
virus infections (e.g., HSV, CMV, EBV). However, here we propose that HIV itself is a major cause of
persistent IA because of ongoing virus production in lymphoid tissues (LT) while on ART. In this revised
proposal, we have one specific aim that tests two hypotheses: 1) Sustained IA during ART is driven by
production of virions and/or expression of viral antigens in reactivated latently infected cells with or without
persistent low-level virus replication; and 2) that persistent low-level virus replication during ART is the result of
intracellular concentrations (IC) of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in LT that do not completely inhibit replication and
virus production. For our first hypothesis we will seek direct evidence of correlations between persistent IA and
virus production/antigen expression in LT by identification, at the single cell level, of: 1) virus-producing CD4 T
cells lacking markers of activation and proliferation that we have previously shown can sustain low levels of
virus production; 2) T follicular helper cells (Tfh) in B cell follicles that have recently been shown to be an
independent reservoir for viral persistence; and 3) reactivated latently infected T cells producing virus or p24.
We propose investigations of these drivers of IA by our validated and highly sensitive in situ hybridization (ISH)
methods to detect, phenotype and locate virus (v) RNA+ and virus-producing cells in LT; by a validated highly
sensitive high throughput “envelope detection by induced transcription-based sequencing” (EDITS) assay; and
a broadly neutralizing antibody (bNab) method to enrich for HIV-envelope (ENV)+ cells. For the hypothesized
correlations of the virus drivers with IA, we will measure IA with standard flow-based antibody assays and with
single cell transcriptomic analysis of LT mononuclear cells to identify unique gene signatures associated with
IA. Our second hypothesis will be tested by quantification of ARV-intracellular concentrations (ICs) in LT and
determine the relationships among ARV-ICs and the frequency of detecting the three putative virus drivers of
IA. Establishing that HIV itself is a cause of IA would point future developments to fully suppress virus
production in the LT reservoir with benefits both in reducing IA and associated pathologies and as an essential
component of HIV Cure Strategies."

A fundamental property of neural systems is the capability for functional adaptation in response to the signals they re-
ceive. Though much has been learned using existing approaches, a major limitation in investigations of neural circuits has
been the need to section the brain, destroying most of the network, and divorcing it from its sensory inputs or behavioral
outputs. The mammalian circadian system, including the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is one such cir-
cuit, unique in that represents a well-defined population of cells that engage in a full suite of functions that typify an entire
nervous system: the network is affected directly by sensory input which is easily manipulated, processes such input to
alter its function, and generates outputs that directly impact behavior. The overall goal of our research program is to un-
derstand how the brain processes sensory light input, integrates that input into the ongoing circadian behavioral/regulatory
program, and generates outputs that regulate behavior and physiological activity. We propose that it is a process involving
hierarchical plasticity, where sensory neurons in the eyes affect the internal clock time of primary oscillator neurons,
which then act on secondary and tertiary systems within the brain to alter global physiology and the timing of sleep/wake.
With in vivo widefield fluorescence imaging using a miniaturized microscope, this circadian neural network can now be
observed in real time during responses to environmental input, goal-directed behaviors, and abnormal function. This ap-
proach provides unprecedented anatomical and phenotypic specificity and can be applied over short (seconds-minutes)
and long (weeks-months) timescales. Our research program comprehensively attacks a range of important systems-level
features of circadian biology which were previously not addressable: cell-type specific acute response to systemic input
(light), the on-going network level processing that occurs in response to that light input, and how those mechanisms begin
to fail with aging. Such studies of hierarchical processing of sensory input, leading to systems-level plasticity and behav-
ioral change, followed over long timescales will pay dividends in understanding the steady-state and aging mammalian
nervous system as a whole."

10808335,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the United States, 10% of infants are born before 37 weeks’ gestation and considered premature. Although
survival has improved, preterm infants remain at increased risk for impairment in neurodevelopment, including
language development. Nearly 35% of infants born between 31- and 34-weeks’ gestation and 50% of infants
born at fewer than 30 weeks’ gestation demonstrate compromised auditory memory and expressive and
receptive language, which persist into adolescence. It is hypothesized that prematurity, which often results in
physiologic insults and white matter injury, as well as the atypical auditory environment of the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit (NICU) impact language development during critical periods. The aberrant auditory
environment is of particular interest because it can be modified to promote experience-dependent plasticity and
improve long-term language outcomes in premature infants. The primary objective of this K23 Mentored
Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to characterize the influence of the NICU’s sensory
environment on auditory processing of maternal voice as well as auditory cortex maturation and circuitry while
accounting for variables known to influence language development including gestational age, sex, medical
condition, socioeconomic status, and maternal stress and depression. To achieve this, Dr. Hammond will
recruit a group of pregnant women and their fetuses who are subsequently born at term and a group of
premature infants. In the first aim, attention to maternal voice will be compared in fetuses and premature
infants using HR responses to a maternal voice stimulus. In the second aim, auditory recognition memory for
maternal voice and auditory cortex maturation will be compared in term and preterm infants using auditory
event-related potentials. In the third aim, infants born preterm and at term will return at a corrected age of two
months and resting-state functional connectivity in the language regions of the brain will be compared. In all
three aims, the impact of characteristics of the auditory environments in utero and in the NICU on these
outcomes will also be evaluated. The findings from the proposed work will advance the field of developmental
neuroscience’s understanding of critical periods for language development and will identify the characteristics
of the auditory environment that promote or impede language development. The results will be used to design
developmentally-appropriate interventions in the NICU that improve the outcomes of premature infants.
Through the proposed work, Dr. Jennifer Hammond, a clinical neonatologist, will acquire mentored training in
developmental neuroscience as well as neurobehavioral, neurophysiologic, and neuroimaging assessments of
fetal and infant brain development to become a successful, independent physician-scientist. Dr. Hammond will
have the support of a rich institutional environment and the commitment of her mentorship team including Dr.
Catherine Monk, Dr. Patricia Kuhl, and Dr. Rachel Marsh, who will ensure that she transitions to independence
and becomes a leader in the fields of developmental neuroscience and neonatology."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) management is particularly challenging during periods of transition, such as at new
diagnosis, early adolescence, when changing treatments, and during the transition from pediatric to adult care.
Difficulties with self-management and increased risk for worsening glycemic and quality of life outcomes often
accompany these challenging periods. Despite decades of behavioral research, there are few empirically
supported behavioral interventions with proven efficacy to improve these outcomes. With foundations in the
science of behavior change and positive psychology, the Resilience and Diabetes (RAD) Behavioral Research
Lab at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and Texas Children’s Hospital (TCH) conducts strengths-based
research that aims to promote positive psychosocial and medical outcomes in young people with T1D and their
family members. The Principal Investigator, Marisa Hilliard, PhD, is a behavioral scientist and psychologist who
leads the multidisciplinary RAD Lab research team and mentors learners, including post-baccalaureate research
staff, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty. Many of Dr. Hilliard’s current mentees identify
as being from racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups that are underrepresented in science, and she has
sought focused training related to providing research mentorship with attention to the experiences and needs of
mentees with diverse identities. She has been recognized for excellent research mentorship and seeks to further
strengthen her skills to build a pipeline of well-trained, diverse early career researchers in the field of behavioral
diabetes science. This K26 proposal aims to strengthen Dr. Hilliard’s skills and capacity to provide personalized,
culturally aware research mentorship to diverse early career researchers interested in behavioral diabetes
research, both within the RAD Lab at BCM and TCH and at other institutions. With the protected time afforded
by the K26, Dr. Hilliard will engage in two primary mentorship-related activities: (1) expanding her capacity to
provide individual and group-based research mentorship to mentees using data from her NIDDK-funded R01s
and other research grants focused on behavioral aspects of living with T1D, and (2) strengthening her skills in
research mentorship through continuous, individual mentorship coaching from national experts who will guide
her in learning and applying skills for anti-racist, culturally aware research mentorship, using a systematic
approach to identifying and fostering mentee strengths, and applying a developmental lens to supporting
research success and professional development for mentees from various disciplines and skill levels. She will
participate in workshops for research mentorship skill development at least annually. To recruit additional early
career mentees from underrepresented backgrounds who have interests in pursuing research training and
careers in behavioral diabetes, she will partner with BCM and TCH pre- and postdoctoral training programs in
Pediatric Diabetes and Endocrinology and Psychology, BCM graduate programs focused on supporting learners
from underrepresented groups, and local and national research training programs and student organizations."
10798109,"Project Summary
This project will determine the impact of returning research results that indicate 5-year risk of developing
Alzheimer Disease (AD) to healthy older adults enrolled in a longitudinal cohort of aging. Returning research
results that indicate risk of AD is controversial for ethical and scientific reasons. Ethical concerns relate to the
potential harms of informing individuals their risk of a highly feared untreatable disease. Scientific concerns
relate to the potential change in cognitive test results due to knowing one’s risk of AD, potentially
compromising the scientific integrity of research studies that follow cognitive outcomes. However, participants
in longitudinal studies of AD increasingly ask for their research results to understand their AD risk. Returning
research results to those who wish to receive them respects autonomy and recognizes participant contributions
to research. Evidence is needed to determine the impact of returning research results on psychosocial and
cognitive outcomes to responsibly design future studies in AD.
A randomized delayed-start clinical trial will evaluate the impact of returning research results to participants in
longitudinal studies of aging. All participants of a longitudinal cohort of aging will be offered the option to
receive research results from a recent PET amyloid scan, MRI, and APOE genotype, presented as a
synthesized 5-year risk of developing AD. All consenting participants will be randomized to either receiving
their research results within 2 weeks or after 1 year. Those who choose to receive results will be followed for
up to 24 months to determine the impact of receiving results on cognitive and psychosocial outcomes. Aim 1
will quantitatively and qualitatively explore the decision to receive results and reasons for declining or choosing
to receive results. Aim 2 will use quantitative and qualitative analyses to determine the effect of returning
research results on 1-year cognitive and psychosocial outcomes. Aim 3 will assess feasibility, acceptability,
and resource requirements of the return of results process and develop educational materials and a training
module for future implementation.
Laying the foundation for widespread return of research results, this is the first systematic and comprehensive
approach to returning research results in cognitively normal persons engaged in biomarker studies of AD."
10798114,"Fragile X-associated tremor/Ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is one of a large class of human neurological disorders
that result from instability and expansion of nucleotide repeats. In FXTAS, a CGG nucleotide repeat expands in
the 5’ untranslated region of the fragile X gene, FMR1, and triggers formation of aggregated protein inclusions
in the patient brains. Our group found that the FXTAS CGG repeat gets translated into toxic homopolymeric
proteins despite its location outside of a canonical open reading frame through a process known as repeat
associated Non-AUG initiated (RAN) translation. RAN translated proteins accumulate in patient tissues and
contribute to CGG repeat associated toxicity in multiple model systems. In this proposal, we will explore how
this alternative translational initiation occurs mechanistically. Our preliminary data suggests that RAN
translation at CGG repeats is selectively enhanced by cellular stress, which typically blocks protein synthesis.
In parallel, CGG repeats directly elicit cellular stress and trigger stress granule formation. Our central
hypothesis is that CGG RAN translation and cellular stress participate in a feed-forward loop that drives
neurodegeneration. Our collaborative team will directly test this hypothesis by using biochemical techniques
as well as drosophila, mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cell models of FXTAS. In Aim 1 we will
determine how cellular stress selectively activates RAN translation, focusing specifically on initiation factors
that underlie this process. In Aim 2, we will elucidate how CGG repeats elicit cellular stress and influence
stress granule dynamics and whether interventions in this process impact repeat toxicity. In Aim 3, we will test
whether selective blockade of cellular stress pathways can disrupt this feed forward loop and alleviate CGG
repeat associated toxicity across disease models. Together, these studies will illuminate critical events in the
pathogenesis of FXTAS and other nucleotide repeat expansion disorders while rigorously testing two
complementary & innovative approaches to selective RAN translation blockade."

Environmental inhalation exposures are inherently mixed (gases and particles), yet environmental regulations
are still based on single toxicant exposures. Developing and studying the co-exposure scenario in a standardized
and controlled fashion will enable a better mechanistic understanding of how environmental exposures result in
adverse outcomes. The impact of co-exposures is poorly studied, especially in susceptible populations such as
individuals with acute lung injury (ALI). In the absence of such knowledge on environmental co-exposures, it will
be very difficult, if not impossible, to reduce the burden of environmental disease and develop effective as well
as realistic exposure limits to safeguard public health. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms of
carbon black (CB; surrogate of the carbon core of ultrafine particles) and ozone (O3) inhalation co-exposure-
induced lung injury and modulation of epithelial regeneration in mice following ALI. We will further mechanistically
characterize the role of mitochondrial nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like Receptor X1 (NLRX1) in
these responses. We hypothesize that co-exposure to CB and O3 synergistically increases pulmonary damage
by oxidizing the particle surfaces, causing NLRX1 mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis,
leading to reprogramming of the alveolar progenitor (AT2) cells for altered alveolar regeneration. Our research
plan exclusively combines state of the art inhalation co-exposures, unique mouse models, and 3-D organoid
cultures to elucidate the mechanisms of co-exposure induced pulmonary damage in healthy and injured lungs
(a susceptibility model). Our preliminary studies demonstrate that O3 and CB inhalation co-exposures
synergistically exacerbates lung injury, oxidative stress, inflammation, lung function decline, lung permeability,
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and lung microbial dysbiosis compared to individual exposures. Mice
lacking NLRX1 exhibit significantly aggravated inflammatory response after co-exposure. Alveolar type 2 (AT2)
cells (alveolar progenitor cells) show significant apoptosis, mitochondrial damage, and impaired ability to form
3-D alveolar organoids after co-exposure. Bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung epithelial injury is significantly
increased, while epithelial proliferation is impaired after co-exposure. Our specific aims are 1) to determine
synergistic biological activity and mechanisms of lung inflammation after co-exposure, 2) to identify how the
altered mechanisms of alveolar injury and alveolar progenitor cell dysfunction contribute to progression and
outcome of ALI, and 3) to characterize microbiome-alveolar progenitor cell cross-talk during co-exposure with or
without ALI. These studies will delineate genetic (NLRX1) and cellular mechanisms (alveolar progenitor
mitochondrial dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis) through which environmental exposures impact ALI
outcomes. These findings will be helpful in understanding the impact of co-exposures on adverse lung effects
and developing preventive and therapeutic efforts to ameliorate the health impact of air pollution."
10830300,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Finding a resolving cure for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), is an urgent critical need. There is ample consensus that
successful treatments should target early pathological events in AD. Among these, synaptic dysfunction induced
by oligomers of both Aβ and tau is recognized as one of the earliest key driving events in AD and thus an
attractive treatment target, but an effective strategy is still missing. Our long-term goal is to help develop
therapeutically useful approaches to increase synaptic resilience to Aβ and tau oligomers for the clinical
treatment of AD patients. With this goal in mind, we recently reported that exosomes specifically released by
hippocampal neural stem cells (NSC-exo) render CNS synapses resilient to the disruptive impact of Aβ oligomers
via selected micro RNA (miRNA) cargoes, a mechanism likely at play in the human brain as suggested by reports
of aged individuals with high numbers of NSC and synapses resilient to Aβ oligomers who remain cognitively
intact despite the CNS presence of extensive AD neuropathology. Whether such mechanism of resilience is also
effective against synaptic disruption brought about by tau oligomers- a recognized major player in the onset and
clinical progression of AD- remain to be established. Thus, the overall objective in this application, is to evaluate
the link between NSC (and their released exosomes) and increased synaptic resilience to the toxic actions of
tau oligomers as a function of aging, the strongest AD risk factor. Based of rigorous previous literature reports
and compelling preliminary results, our central hypothesis is that NSC-exo, via delivering unique miRNA cargoes,
render synapses resistant to toxic tau oligomers and that such protective mechanism fails during aging owing to
the well-documented age-related loss of NSC, leaving the aged brain more vulnerable to the AD toxic amyloids
(and therefore more at risk of developing clinically manifest AD). The rationale for this project is that a
determination of the preclinical therapeutic efficacy and associated mechanisms of NSC-exo (and their miRNA
cargoes) as a function of aging is likely to offer a strong scientific framework whereby a new strategy centered
on promoting synaptic resilience to AD pathological oligomers could be developed. To obtain the overall objective,
we will pursue three specific aims that will evaluate the efficacy of NSC-exo in promoting synaptic resilience to
Tau oligomers (Aim 1), determine the invoved miRNA cargoes and their impact on key synaptic proteins (Aim
2) and evaluate the impact of aging on such protective mechanisms as a function of decreasing numbers of
resident NSC and their released exosomes (Aim 3). At the completion of the proposed studies, it is our
expectation that we will have documented a previously unappreciated phenomenon of synaptic resistance to
toxic oligomers mediated by NSC-exo and their miRNA cargo that fails during aging. This discovery will illustrate
targets for the development of an innovative treatment concept for AD centered on sustaining synaptic
resistance to toxic oligomers in an aging environment, a strategy expected to be effective in humans as
suggested by the existence of aged resilient subjects with high NSC numbers and synapses that reject oligomers."
10929469,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
More than 80,000 Americans died in 2021 from fentanyl and other high-potency opioids. The emergence of
illicit, highly potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl is a key contributing factor to the recent spike in opioid-
related mortality, increasing ten-fold since 2016. While the mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist naloxone has
proven invaluable as an opioid overdose antidote, naloxone suffers from a very short duration of action (half-
life ~1 hour) and is less effective against newer, longer-acting opioids, including fentanyl (half-life ~7-10 hours).
This leads to a highly lethal and increasingly prevalent phenomenon known as “renarcotization,” whereby an
overdose patient revived with naloxone re-enters an overdose state from residual fentanyl in the body.
To counter renarcotization, naloxone must be given repeatedly and at significantly higher doses. While usually
achievable in a hospital, renarcotization is often not recognized or monitored for outside of a medical setting
and may lead to unexpected death. A critical, unmet need exists to develop a long-acting MOR antagonist
formulation that prevents renarcotization by providing 12-24 hours of protection to allow opioid levels to drop
below dangerous levels.
The objective of this project is to advance development of CP216, a novel, long-acting naloxone formulation that
utilizes an innovative design to address both primary and secondary overdose through a combination of free
form naloxone for immediate effect and microencapsulated naloxone for sustained protection. This new
formulation will be especially useful in rural areas, where access to emergency medical services is often delayed,
or for Warfighters poisoned by weaponized opioids that need sustained protection while transported to
definitive medical care.
Other attempts to address renarcotization using high or frequent doses of naloxone or nalmefene have limited
protection for high-potency opioids and can induce precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW) in those with opioid
dependence. POW is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition and for this reason causes some
overdose victims to refuse continued naloxone treatment after rescue. Still other efforts to chemically modify
naloxone are subject to significant regulatory and technical risk. Consegna’s drug (CP216) is approvable through
the accelerated 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway and is, according to recent studies, unlikely to induce POW and
would therefore gain more acceptance among overdose patients.
Consegna believes this project will have a positive impact on public health by leading to the first safe and
effective product to completely address renarcotization."
10916439,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The centromere is a network of proteins rooted to centromeric DNA by nucleosomes containing a
centromere-specific histone H3 paralog, CENP-A. Despite the centromere’s conserved role in chromosome
segregation, a subset of its proteins that are essential for its function exhibit molecular signatures of rapid
adaptive evolution. Repetitive centromeric satellite DNA also rapidly evolves, drastically diverging in sequence
between species. The “centromere drive hypothesis” proposes that a genetic conflict between centromeric
DNA and proteins causes their rapid evolution. Specifically, centromeric DNAs behave selfishly and increase
their inheritance through female meiosis (drive) by increasing binding affinity for centromeric proteins. Selfish
centromeres are also detrimental to the organism, which selects for novel centromeric protein variants with a
lower affinity for the selfish DNA, thereby suppressing drive. The centromere drive hypothesis further predicts
that distinct evolutionary lineages undergo unique bouts of centromeric DNA-protein co-evolution, leading to
deleterious centromeric DNA-protein incompatibilities in hybrids that promote reproductive isolation.
 I have developed a novel experimental system to test three key propositions of the centromere drive
hypothesis. The first is that centromeric DNA repeat variants differentially recruit centromere proteins. By
fertilizing the eggs of M. musculus with the sperm of divergent Murinae species, I test whether the two species
centromeric DNA repeats differ in their ability to recruit centromeric proteins from the hybrid zygote cytoplasm.
My preliminary data indicate that Mus pahari CENP-A nucleosomes have a higher binding affinity for a key
centromeric protein scaffold, CENP-C, than M. musculus CENP-A nucleosomes. For my first aim, I will
biochemically reconstitute the M. pahari CENP-A nucleosome and test whether the centromeric DNA that
wraps it imparts this increase in CENP-C binding. For my second aim, I will test whether rapidly evolving
centromere protein orthologs (variants) differentially bind to centromere DNA. I will transiently express various
centromere protein orthologs in hybrid zygotes and determine whether their binding preferences for the two
species’ centromeres differ. For my third aim, I will test whether divergent centromere DNAs result in
deleterious incompatibilities in hybrids. I found that in M. musculus / M. pahari hybrid zygotes, a subset of M.
pahari centromeres are mispackaged. I will generate a more contiguous M. pahari genome assembly to
determine if unique M. pahari centromeric DNA sequences underly this mispackaging, and test whether
mispackaging causes deleterious chromosome missegregation.
 The hybrid embryo system that I developed serves as a powerful tool to interrogate not only functional
divergence of centromeric DNA and proteins, but also genetic conflict more broadly by uncoupling selfish
DNAs from their species-specific suppressors. This system and my training will position me to establish a
future research program around diverse mammalian selfish genetic elements (see Career Goals)."

Children with in-utero exposure to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP; gestational hypertension, chronic
hypertension, preeclampsia, and superimposed preeclampsia) have an increased risk for hypertension and
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our preliminary data indicate that administering first-line antihypertensives
during pregnancy improves neonatal outcomes. However, the long-term impact of in-utero exposure to
antihypertensive treatment on childhood subclinical CVD risk factors (i.e., high oxidative stress, inflammation,
and arterial stiffness) is unknown. Further, it has not been established whether environmental exposures
influence the association of in-utero exposure to HDP on childhood subclinical CVD. Assessing subclinical
CVD in childhood is particularly important because longitudinal research shows that poor
cardiovascular health in childhood is associated with a higher incidence of hypertension,
atherosclerosis, and other cardiovascular events in later life. Thus, the objectives of this study are to 1)
Investigate whether in-utero exposure to antihypertensive treatment (compared to no treatment) is associated
with improved childhood (ages 5–10 years) subclinical CVD, and 2) Examine whether neighborhood deprivation
(i.e., a composite measure of environmental exposures) influences the association between in-utero exposure
to HDP and offspring subclinical CVD. The central hypothesis is that in-utero exposure to antihypertensive
treatment is associated with improved subclinical CVD among children born to mothers with HDP. We also posit
that neighborhood deprivation significantly influences the association between in-utero exposure to HDP and
offspring subclinical CVD. Completion of the research aims in this proposal will inform the development
of an intervention to improve vascular outcomes among children born to mothers with HDP. This research plan
will be augmented by intensive mentoring from a multidisciplinary team of experts, didactic coursework, and
formal training at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
The training plan was crafted to ensure that Dr. Martin achieves her specified career development goals, which
are to 1) Develop advanced skills to assess subclinical cardiovascular risk factors in children and gain a deep
understanding of the intergenerational transmission of CVD, 2) Develop expertise in the assessment of social
determinants of health and environmental exposures, 3) Develop a comprehensive knowledge of intervention
approaches and statistical analysis for clinical research in maternal-fetal-child health; and 4) Refine grant writing
skills for future grant mechanisms. Completion of the training aims in this proposal will transform clinical
care by providing new insight regarding the long-term impact of in-utero exposure to antihypertensive treatment
and will uniquely position Dr. Martin for a career that allows her to make a significant contribution to slowing the
progression of CVD for high-risk children born to mothers with HDP and other exposures."

This application is focused development of a new therapeutic for pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG), including a
rare subset known as Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). DIPG is a rare brain cancer primarily affecting
children, with approximately 200-300 new annual cases in the United States, less than 2 percent survival at 2
years, and with a limited response to therapeutic radiation (RT). Recently published studies in preclinical glioma
models have revealed that RT results in a progressive accumulation of monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs)
and activated microglia, and that inhibition of the recruitment of MDMs delays glioma recurrence. There is
substantial evidence demonstrating a key role for chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 or ‘CCL2’ also known as
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in RT-induced inflammation, including the recruitment of MDMs
into the brain and tumor microenvironment (TME). These studies not only show that RT induces a transient and
selective upregulation of CCL2 within hours of exposure, but also demonstrate disruption of CCL2 signaling
during this time frame alone is sufficient to attenuate chronic microglial activation and to allow the recovery of
neurogenesis in the weeks following radiation. However, there is a desperate need for new agents that are not
only potent inhibitors of CCL2 production and signaling, but that are also safe for administration in combination
with RT. The synthetic oleanane triterpenoids (SOTs) evaluated in this application meet these criteria. The
research team pursues ground-breaking, high-risk, high-gain studies that address our central hypothesis that
chronic, systemic oral administration of a newly developed SOT (CDDO-2P-Im or ‘2P-Im’) will enhance the
radiation response of DIPG through mechanisms that include suppression of RT-induced recruitment and
activation myeloid cells in the brain, with potential to also limit RT-related toxicity. Preliminary data show 900
nanomoles of 2P-Im/kg of brain at 6 hours after a 1 µmole dose, given either by intraperitoneal injection or by
oral gavage in mice, and that 2P-Im inhibits CCL2 production by activated human macrophages at picomolar
concentrations in vitro. The project is organized around three specific aims that: (1) define the effect of 2P-Im
(both alone and in combination with RT) on in vitro clonogenic survival of DIPG cell lines, including those
harboring the histone H3.3 Lys 27-to-methionine (K27M) mutation, and the relationship to direct molecular
targets of 2P-Im (AIM 1); (2) determine the dose- and time-dependent effects of 2P-Im on RT-induced recruitment
of MDMs and on microglial activation (AIM 2); and (3)
demonstrate the in vivo efficacy and activity of
2P-Im
(administered in rodent diet) in established, orthotopic PDX models of DIPG, including the capacity of 2P-Im to
enhance the radiation response of DIPG xenografts in vivo, (AIM 3). Data generated in this proposal will position
2P-Im for advancement to critical, IND-enabling studies, and as a novel, orally bioavailable therapy for a highly
aggressive, refractory rare childhood cancer."

Research in the Experimental Therapeutics (ET) program focuses on identification, development and testing of 
new cancer therapeutics. This is accomplished through three overlapping specific aims centered on 1) 
identifying potential targets and discovering therapeutics leads, 2) conducting preclinical evaluation of 
promising new therapeutic approaches, and 3) evaluating innovative and promising agents, combinations, and 
approaches to monitoring response in clinical trials. ET investigators are highly collaborative. Key scientific 
achievements of ET investigators over the prior funding period include identification of novel therapeutic 
targets in endometrial cancer and myeloma, nanoparticle based drug development, cancer immunotherapy 
based on toll-like receptor (TLR9) agonists, use of pharmacologic ascorbate to enhance the efficacy and 
reduce the toxicity of both chemotherapy and radiation therapy (in collaboration with the FRMI Program), and 
expansion of investigator-initiated and Phase I capabilities including trials of intralesional therapy. There are 28 
full and 16 associate members of ET including laboratory-based, translational and clinical investigators 
spanning 13 departments across five colleges. Annual total peer-reviewed cancer direct costs in the most 
recent budget year was $2.7 million ($1.9 million from the NCI). Additional funding included $3.8 million for 
non-peer-reviewed research projects. ET members are highly collaborative having authored or co-authored 
291 cancer-related peer-reviewed publications in the past five years, with 24% (n= 69) intraprogrammatic, 43% 
(n= 124) interprogrammatic, and 42% (n= 123) interinstitutional publications. Twenty-nine manuscripts 
appeared in high impact journals (Impact Factor ≥10)."

Children with speech sound disorder show diminished intelligibility in spoken communication, with negative con-
sequences for both social-emotional and academic-occupational outcomes [1–4]. While most speech deviations
resolve by the late school-age years, between 2-5% of speakers exhibit residual speech sound disorder (RSSD)
that persists through adolescence or even adulthood [5–7]. Both affected children/families and speech-language
pathologists (SLPs) have highlighted the critical need for research to identify more effective forms of treatment for
children with RSSD. Our work in the previous funding cycle showed that individuals with RSSD benefit from treat-
ment incorporating technologically enhanced sensory feedback (visual-acoustic biofeedback, ultrasound biofeed-
back). However, real-world adoption of biofeedback treatment remains limited by equipment costs and lack of
access to providers with specialized training.
 For our next phase of research, we focus on developing methods to support wider implementation of
technology-enhanced treatment for RSSD. Specifically, we investigate the possibility that access to biofeedback
can be expanded through telepractice service delivery and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered technol-
ogy to extend the services provided by SLPs. At the same time, we evaluate whether the efficacy of biofeedback
can be further enhanced by adopting a precision medicine approach in which a treatment method is selected
based on a learner’s individual profile of sensory strengths and weaknesses.
 In this proposal, we will conduct the first controlled comparison of biofeedback treatment delivered in person
versus via telepractice (Aim 1), testing our hypothesis that biofeedback intervention can be delivered remotely
without any unacceptable loss of efficacy. If successful, this study will greatly expand the reach of biofeedback by
making it easier for children with RSSD to connect with trained clinicians. In Aim 2, we will utilize technology de-
veloped in the previous funding cycle to assess whether the maintenance of gains achieved through biofeedback
treatment can be enhanced through AI-mediated home practice. Finally, Aim 3 will lay groundwork for a precision
medicine approach by testing whether relative response to ultrasound and visual-acoustic biofeedback can be
predicted from a learner’s profile of sensory response across auditory and somatosensory domains.
 While new technologies have the potential to revolutionize the development and delivery of interventions for
speech disorders, there is an ongoing need for well-designed research studies to bring these advances into
evidence-based clinical practice. This research will address the needs of children with RSSD and the clinicians
who treat them by providing a robust evidence base to guide clinical decision-making and user-friendly tools that
support implementation."
10932968,"Summary/Abstract
Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) promote therapeutic resistance and poor clinical outcomes in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). Central to the function of LSCs is a capacity for aberrant self-renewal, but the mechanisms
underlying this activity are not well understood. The long-term goal is to identify these mechanisms to develop
new therapies that can eradicate LSCs to improve clinical outcomes. The overall objectives in this application
are to (i) determine if LSCs from specific genetic subtypes of AML are dependent on regulation of protein
synthesis, (ii) determine whether LSCs in high-risk hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-like AMLs are more dependent
on regulated protein synthesis, and (iii) test a novel therapeutic strategy inhibiting protein synthesis in LSCs. The
central hypothesis is that LSCs aberrantly self-renew by adopting from normal HSCs a dependence on tightly
regulated protein synthesis. The rationale for this project is based on the finding that the cell surface marker
CD99 is selectively overexpressed on LSCs and serves to regulate protein synthesis to promote LSC function.
This offers a strong scientific framework by which new strategies to deplete LSCs can be developed. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determining the role of regulated protein synthesis
in promoting LSC function; 2) Determining if the cell-of-origin of AML influences the dependence of LSCs on
regulated protein synthesis; and 3) Determining if inhibition of protein synthesis can deplete LSCs in high-risk
AML. In the first aim, genetically engineered mice will be used to generate models of AML lacking CD99, to test
if this leads to dysregulated protein synthesis that impairs LSC self-renewal. LSCs from these models will be
evaluated to determine if they require low protein synthesis rates to prevent induction of tumor suppressors, the
unfolded protein response, and the integrated stress response. Ribosome profiling will be performed to identify
key LSC regulators selectively translated in the context of regulated protein synthesis. In the second aim, we will
generate a mouse model of HSC-like AML which mimics high-risk human AML. We will assess if LSCs in HSC-
like AML exhibit heightened sensitivity to dysregulated protein synthesis. These studies will be complemented
with an evaluation of protein synthesis in HSC-like human LSCs to determine if they also require maintenance
of low levels of protein synthesis. The third aim will test if the combination of a ribosome biogenesis-inhibitor with
a BCL2-inhibitor currently used to treat AML can eradicate LSCs in high-risk HSC-like AML. The proposal is
innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it aims to leverage a novel LSC-specific cell surface marker to
establish a new paradigm for understanding mechanisms underlying LSC self-renewal. The proposed research
is significant because it is expected to provide a strong scientific justification for the development of therapies
inhibiting protein synthesis to overcome therapeutic resistance in patients with high-risk AML. Ultimately, the
knowledge gained from these studies may offer insights into the mechanisms that promote the function of cancer
stem cells in general, opening up opportunities for the development of new strategies to treat cancer."

 This objective of this research is to develop metabolic interventions to improve sleep quality and
anesthesia safety in the elderly and eventually to treat neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease.
The aging brain has many changes including mitochondrial dysfunction, insulin resistance and decreased
neurotransmitter release leading to poor sleep quality and more complications with general anesthesia. The
ability of the brain to use glucose declines with age but the brain's ability to use ketones as fuel remains. Ketone
bodies are produced naturally from the breakdown of fatty acids and become a major fuel source for the brain
during times of starvation, exercise and high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets. The ketone bodies acetoacetate and
beta-hydroxybutyrate not only provide energy to the brain but also have potent signaling and anti-inflammatory
effects. The activation of inflammatory pathways, such as nuclear factor kappa B, are thought to be one
mechanism through which sleep disturbance and dementia are linked as well as post-operative delirium and
post-operative cognitive dysfunction. The inflammatory response is also tightly correlated with the onset and
clinical course of Alzheimer's disease and disruptions in sleep are an early biomarker of Alzheimer's disease.
Sleep quality declines with normal age as well, losing restorative slow and delta power and becoming more
fragmented. Therefore, targeting brain energy usage by providing ketones could be one strategy for improving
sleep quality in aged animals. In addition, the aged population is more susceptible to general anesthesia. Less
anesthesia is needed to anesthetize older people and they are more likely to develop post-operative cognitive
dysfunction. The energy substrate and anti-inflammatory effects of ketones could be neuroprotective during
anesthesia in the aged brain. Taken together, these ideas give rise to novel strategies that address the
dysfunctional neuronal metabolic-immune interactions in the aged brain by increasing ketones that could lead to
improved sleep quality (AIM 1) and safer delivery of general anesthesia (AIM 2) to the elderly. These innovative
strategies to improve brain health in the aged population have the potential for broad impact as many brain
diseases have components of metabolic dysregulation including epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's
disease, autism, anxiety, depression and glioblastoma."

Cellular inclusions of proteins are primary hallmarks of a great majority of neurodegenerative diseases. In
common forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (frontotemporal
dementia; limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE)) as well as some forms of
Alzheimer’s disease, the essential human TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) forms intraneuronal
aggregates. Importantly, dozens of missense mutations in an aggregation-prone domain of TDP-43 have been
found in familial and sporadic cases of ALS and frontotemporal dementia. These data provide strong support
for the direct causative pathological role for TDP-43 in neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease related
dementias and motor neuron disease. Additionally, recent research modulating the TDP-43 interactome
demonstrates that TDP-43 is an important potential therapeutic targets in these diseases. However,
therapeutic development is hampered in large part by an absence of mechanistic understanding of normal
TDP-43 function, the molecular effect of the mutations causing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and
frontotemporal dementia, and the TDP-43 disruption in neurodegenerative disease. These gaps are due in
large part to a lack of atomic structural data regarding TDP-43, its complexes, and its conversion to
aggregates, which in turn is due to the difficulty in observing TDP-43 complexes via traditional structural
biology techniques. This project will make use of integrated experimental and computational structural biology
techniques combined with molecular and cell biology approaches to 1) determine the atomistic details of the
assembly of a helical sub-region of TDP-43, its contribution to splicing function, and its structural conversion in
disease aggregates, 2) identify how known and novel post-translational modifications and disease-associated
mutations alter TDP-43 self- and hetero-protein contacts that mediate and regulate TDP-43 liquid-liquid phase
separation and disease-associated aggregation, and 3) map the structural basis of the interactions of TDP-43
with poly(ADP-ribose) and importin machinery that serve as promising therapeutic targets. The challenging,
dynamic, structural targets necessitate the approach highlighting a tight connection between molecular
simulation and experimental biophysical techniques (primarily NMR spectroscopy). These approaches will
generate detailed molecular models of the interactions that will be tested for functional relevance using in cell
aggregation, in cell splicing, and in cell protein/RNA binding structure (iCLIP). The results of these studies on
TDP-43 complexes, phase-separation, function, and aggregation will provide direct structural and mechanistic
input to the design of strategies to prevent toxic disruption of TDP-43 in Alzheimer’s disease related dementias
and motor neuron disease. These insights represent potential for future treatments for ALS, frontotemporal
dementia, and other TDP-43-associated diseases that currently have no cure or effective treatments."
10805394,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of my program of research is to develop and inform preventive interventions to improve
parent–child outcomes for families affected by substance use. The focus of this K23 award is to inform and
adapt an evidenced-based preventive parenting intervention, the Family Check-Up (FCU), to improve parent–
child outcomes among pregnant women with opioid use disorder (OUD). OUD is often accompanied by co-
occurring psychosocial challenges (e.g., mental health, compromised interpersonal relationships) that impact
caregiving quality. Existing parenting interventions for women with OUD largely begin postnatally, with the few
extant prenatal interventions narrowly focused on parenting education and skills and ending at or shortly after
birth. Further, existing interventions are often ill-equipped to address the common and complex psychosocial
challenges of women with OUD. As such, existing parenting interventions miss opportunities to intervene to
prevent the development of parenting challenges before the child’s birth and to intervene during pregnancy,
which is a peak window of engagement in OUD treatment services and enhanced motivation to engage in
recovery. This proposal addresses the need for parenting interventions for pregnant women with OUD that
begin during pregnancy and address co-occurring psychosocial challenges. Accordingly, the proposed project
will use qualitative and quantitative research methods to adapt and pilot the FCU for delivery during pregnancy
within a prenatal primary care setting for women with OUD. Aim 1 will qualitatively characterize the parenting
needs of women with OUD across the perinatal period, barriers to engagement in parenting interventions, and
desired outcomes of intervention. Aim 2 will adapt the FCU intervention for pregnancy using the ADAPT-ITT
framework and data collected during Aim 1. Aim 3 will conduct a pilot study of the prenatal FCU assessing
engagement and short-term outcomes including maternal psychosocial functioning (mental health and
interpersonal functioning) and parent–child relationship quality and self-efficacy.
To achieve the proposed goals and transition to independence, I require training in perinatal opioid use,
applied qualitative and mixed-methods research, and methods for developing and testing preventive
interventions. An experienced team will guide my training. Dr. Shaw (co-primary mentor) is a clinical and
developmental psychologist and co-developer of the postpartum FCU with expertise in parenting interventions
and prevention science. Dr. Krans (co-primary mentor) is an obstetrician-gynecologist and substance use
treatment provider with expertise in perinatal OUD and women’s health. Dr. Chang (co-mentor) is an
obstetrician-gynecologist with expertise in qualitative research methods and women’s health. The training and
research plan will form the basis to support an R-level proposal with the goal of bridging pre- and postnatal
parenting interventions to optimize support for families and young children affected by substance use."
10805396,"Our overall approach is to focus on multi-component in vitro reconstitutions that will provide insight into complex
biological processes such as cargo transport and cytokinesis. Expressed proteins used in the reconstitutions will
be biochemically characterized, and single-molecule and biochemical/biophysical techniques will assess motor
function. Cytoplasmic dynein-1 and kinesins drive long-distance motion on microtubules, which is required for
cell polarity and function. Dynein moves to the minus-end of the polar MT and drives retrograde transport, while
kinesins of class 1, 2 and 3 power motion to the opposite plus-end and drive anterograde transport. The biological
cargoes of these motors include membrane-bound vesicles, organelles and mRNA. Defects in trafficking
contribute to developmental and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Huntington’s and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis). Bidirectional motion of cellular cargoes as well as purified organelles are driven by motors of opposite
directionality in many organisms and cell types. Dynein requires both dynactin and an activating adaptor for full
motor activity, and these adaptors are emerging as scaffolds for coupling both dynein and kinesin motors. A
major goal is to build on our in vitro reconstituted complex containing dynein-dynactin, the adaptor protein
Bicaudal D, the mRNA-binding protein Egalitarian, and mRNA cargo by the addition of kinesin-1. Preliminary
data show that this complex recapitulates the bidirectional motion seen in the cell. We will use biophysical and
single molecule techniques (TIRF and iSCAT microscopy) to determine the stepping patterns and force
dependence of these complexes to understand how the motors co-ordinate and/or compete to achieve this
motion. We will determine if coupling dynein with different classes of transporting kinesins (kinesin-1, kinesin-2,
or kinesin-3) affects the outcome, and how microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) regulate these transport
complexes. To generalize findings, we will reconstitute a dynein-kinesin-1 complex based on the scaffolding
protein huntingtin, because it plays a causative role in Huntington’s disease. A second goal is to further our
biochemical/biophysical characterization of fission yeast myosins involved in cytokinesis. A major driving force
for cytokinesis is the interaction between myosin and actin that powers constriction of the contractile ring. The
complexity of this process in animal cells has led to the use of fission yeast as a favored model system. To
propose a more detailed molecular mechanism for cytokinesis in fission yeast it is essential to have an in depth
characterization of the principal contractile components. Here we will use biochemical/biophysical techniques to
characterize the two class II myosins involved in cytokinesis (Myo2 and Myp2), and determine how light chain
phosphorylation regulates their speed and force output. Lastly, we will pursue via collaboration how track
geometry influences transport of cargo (liposomes) with bound myoVa and kinesin-1 on suspended actin and
microtubule tracks, which is relevant to both the initiation and termination of motility."
10805528,"In cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, arginine metabolism is often shunted into the pathways that
produce polyamines, small polycationic metabolites essential for cell growth and immuno-suppression. Such
mechanisms in part account for the refractoriness of certain types of cancers, including breast cancer, to
immunotherapy. However, there is a critical gap in developing a method to correct arginine metabolism to
improve the immunogenicity of breast cancer. The long-term goal of our project is to develop an adjuvant
treatment to improve breast cancer immunotherapy with little side effects. Specifically, the objective of this
study is to test whether sepiapterin, the naturally-occurring precursor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) cofactor
BH4, could normalize arginine metabolism in the breast to prevent cancer formation or enhance the efficacy of
breast cancer immunotherapy. Our central hypothesis is that sepiapterin shunts arginine metabolism into the
pathways for NO synthesis in breast cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Such shifts
reduce polyamine production, suppress tumor growth and immuno-suppressive mechanisms. This improves
the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy with little systemic toxicity. Our hypothesis is based on the results of our
and others’ previous studies. The two major arginine metabolic pathways, NO production vs. polyamine
synthesis, antagonize each other. Consistently, we found that sepiapterin elevates NO synthesis and inhibits
growth-stimulatory and immune-suppressive molecules, such as polyamines, while converting TAMs from M2
(immuno-suppressive) to M1 (immuno-stimulatory) types within tumors. Besides, sepiapterin has been safely
utilized in humans and animals to treat certain metabolic disorders. The rationale is that this study will help
develop a novel method to normalize arginine metabolism and improve the immunogenicity of breast cancer.
Our hypothesis will be tested through two SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Determine whether sepiapterin normalizes
arginine metabolism in mammary tumor cells and tumor microenvironment Determine the efficacy and
safety of sepiapterin for the treatment and prevention of HER2-positive mammary tumor. In Aim 1, breast
cancer cells, TAMs and mammary tumors are treated with sepiapterin in culture, and their metabolites and the
respective enzymes are measured. In Aim 2, mice bearing or prone to HER2-positive mammary tumors are
treated with sepiapterin and tested for the inhibition or prevention of tumor growth. The proposed study is
innovative because it tests for the first time whether sepiapterin, the naturally produced precursor of the NOS
; and 2)
cofactor, could normalize arginine metabolism, improve the immunogenicity of breast cancer to inhibit the
growth or prevent breast cancer formation. The study is significant because it will have a positive translational
impact by justifying the use of sepiapterin as an adjuvant to breast cancer immunotherapy or a preventative
agent for breast cancer. Given that there is currently no FDA-approved immunotherapy for HER2-positive
breast cancer, successful results of this study will warrant future clinical trials."
10805530,"Host factors and viral determinants mediating flavivirus NS1 tissue-specific endothelial dysfunction and
vascular leak
ABSTRACT
The flavivirus (FV) genus contains medically important mosquito-borne human pathogens that cause a major
global disease burden. While dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are systemic, and
West Nile (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), and Zika viruses cause neurotropic infections, each FV can
cause severe disease characterized in part by endothelial barrier dysfunction – the most classic example being
vascular leak in severe dengue. This may result from overproduction of vasoactive cytokines as well as viral
factors. The highly conserved FV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected cells and circulates in
the blood of infected humans. We and others have shown that FV NS1 can trigger endothelial barrier disruption
in vitro and vascular leak in mice, independently from virus infection. In our current R01, we showed that endo-
cytosis of FV NS1 into endothelial cells (ECs) followed by activation of key enzymes such as cathepsin L and
heparanase leads to disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) as well as mislocalization of intercellular
junction proteins, both critical for maintaining endothelial barrier integrity. Interestingly, we found that FV NS1
proteins display exquisite tissue tropism, triggering EC dysfunction in vitro and in vivo in a manner reflecting
tissue tropism and disease manifestations of each virus. While FV NS1 tissue tropism was determined by
differential EC binding and internalization, downstream activation of key enzymes and signaling pathways
required for pathogenesis appear to be conserved across FVs. However, host factors, viral determinants, and
mechanisms mediating these processes are unknown. We hypothesize that distinct host factors on tissue-
specific ECs mediate FV NS1 cell binding and internalization, leading to endothelial barrier dysfunction, virus
dissemination, and different FV disease manifestations. In contrast, once a FV NS1 protein is internalized, we
hypothesize that downstream steps of EC dysfunction are comparable – thus pointing the way to a pan-FV
intervention. Here, we expand our previous work by identifying and characterizing host glycans, proteins,
and NS1 determinants required for tissue-specific cell binding and internalization of NS1 in human ECs, mouse
models, and clinical samples. We also define common mechanisms by which FV NS1 proteins trigger
pathology. In Aim 1, we will identify and characterize host glycans and FV NS1 determinants required for differ-
ential binding to tissue-specific ECs. In Aim 2, we will identify proteinaceous NS1 receptors required to initiate
EC dysfunction and define mechanisms by which FV NS1 proteins mediate disruption of the EGL and intercellular
junctions in tissue-specific ECs in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3 investigates the impact of FV NS1-mediated endothelial
dysfunction on FV dissemination and pathogenesis in mouse models and human clinical samples from severe
dengue and YF patients in Vietnam, Nicaragua and Brazil. This work is supported by experts in glycobiology, FV
structural biology and biochemistry, vascular biology, FV pathogenesis and animal models, and clinical
investigation and should identify biomarkers of severe FV disease and novel viral and host therapeutic targets."

Healthy bone is critically important to systemic health. Of relevance to the craniofacial complex, dental implants
require that empty sockets are filled with bone prior to implant placement and restoring dentition. Bone quality
and bone amount are strongly correlated with both the short- and long-term success of dental implants.
Biomaterials-based bone regeneration is promising to circumvent shortcomings of bone grafting. These
biomaterials can be functionalized with instructive components which guide tissue regeneration. Exosomes,
thought to be nature's endogenous biomolecule delivery platform, are particularly interesting because of their
innate biocompatibility and capacity to communicate with cells to modulate their phenotype. Recent in vitro
data suggests that exosomes derived from mineralizing MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts are able to induce
mineralization in naive bone marrow stromal cells. However, engineering a means for their efficient therapeutic
delivery in vivo, in a clinically and biologically relevant manner is a challenge in exosome-mediated therapy.
The overall therapeutic goal of this project is to exploit the regenerative capacity of endogenous mesenchymal
stem cells by mimicking the natural secretion of exosomes with a polymeric tissue engineering construct. My
preliminary data suggests that polymeric self-assembly via a tunable biodegradable copolymer can
encapsulate exosomes, which are released in a sustained fashion over time. My central hypothesis is that
controlled release of osteogenic exosomes from a polymer matrix will promote craniofacial bone
healing.
The specific aims are to 1) develop a well-controlled fabrication method which allows incorporation of an
exosome-releasing modality into a three-dimensional tissue engineering construct; 2) evaluate the integrity of
the bioactive exosome contents during encapsulation and release, and their ability to cause phenotype
changes in downstream cells; and 3) validate the technology invented herein in two in vivo models of
craniofacial bone regeneration. The outcomes of the proposed experiments will demonstrate a means for the
encapsulation and controlled delivery of exosomes from a polymer matrix, causing craniofacial bone
regeneration without stem cell transplantation. Effective exosome encapsulation and release strategies, which
preserve their biologic activity, are critical to advancing the field of exosome-mediated clinical therapies, which
can be applied to the regeneration of many tissue types."

The ability to learn, consolidate and retrieve information begins to decline with normal aging, a major risk
factor for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and dementia. In addition to aging, sedentary behavior ranks first in the
US and third in the world as a risk factor for causing cognitive decline and exacerbating AD. Greater and
accelerated rates of cognitive impairment in women with AD underscore the need for identifying the
mechanisms by which exercise prevents cognitive decline in normal aging and AD in both sexes. As observed
by our labs and others, hippocampus-dependent learning is facilitated by exercise in situations that are usually
subthreshold for encoding and memory consolidation and requires the induction of brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF). Our data suggest that specific exercise patterns can engage a ‘molecular memory’ for that
experience that persists through periods of sedentary behavior and enables a short exercise session, to again,
induce hippocampal BDNF and facilitate memory. We have proposed that epigenetic mechanisms mediate
this “molecular memory” of exercise, as the epigenome represents a signal transduction platform that is
capable of encoding past experience, current metabolic states (because nearly every epigenetic modification
is a metabolite) and establishing stable changes in cell function that lead to long-term changes in behavior.
Preliminary data in this proposal lead us to propose the novel hypothesis that specific patterns of exercise
establish a molecular feedback loop that integrates rate-limiting aspects of acetyl-CoA metabolism and
histone acetylation/methylation mechanisms to modulate gene expression required for long-term memory
formation and synaptic plasticity. Our goal in this proposal is to define, in aging wild type and 5xFAD female
and male mice, the exercise parameters that establish a molecular memory, to investigate the effect of
exercise on acetyl-CoA metabolic pathways and histone modifications and to determine whether
manipulations to this molecular feedback loop overcome deficiencies in synaptic plasticity and memory
formation in aging and 5xFAD female and male mice. We propose three Aims. Aim 1 - Determine how specific
exercise patterns affect synaptic plasticity and memory formation in aging wild type mice and 5xFAD mice.
Aim 2 - determine the effect of exercise on acetyl-CoA metabolic pathways, histone modification, and gene
expression in aging wild type mice and 5xFAD mice. Aim 3 - determine the effect of ameliorating hippocampal
acetyl-CoA deficiencies in aging and 5xFAD mice on gene expression, synaptic plasticity and memory
formation. Overall, successful completion of the research in this proposal will improve our understanding of
how the epigenome integrates information from metabolism (acetyl-CoA dynamics) and experience
(exercise), how this interplay becomes impaired with aging and in the context of AD, and how pharmacological
modulation of acetyl-CoA dynamics may improve age- and AD-related cognitive dysfunction."
10803906,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Malaria remains a global health disease that affects 40% of the world’s population and killed 619,000 in 2021.
The etiologic agent of malaria are Plasmodium spp. parasites, of which Plasmodium falciparum is the most
prevalent and deadly species. The World Health Organization recommends artemisinin-based combination
therapies (ACTs) as first-line treatment for falciparum malaria, and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is the active
metabolite of all clinically-used artemisinins. Artemisinin resistance (ART-R) has been documented globally and
is prevalent in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia, presenting a major hurdle to malaria eradication.
The most well-characterized genetic marker of ART-R is mutations in the propeller domains of Kelch13, a protein
that structurally resembles an E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor. Our studies utilize isogenic parasites of Cambodian
origin with mutations in Kelch13 and the proteasome. We have shown that P. falciparum-specific proteasome
inhibitors kill ART-R parasites, and that mutations in the proteasome increase susceptibility to DHA. Moreover,
proteasome inhibitors synergize with distinct classes of antimalarials that perturb proteostasis, including DHA.
We and others have shown that DHA non-specifically and promiscuously alkylates heme and nearby parasite
proteins. However, whether alkylated proteins are ubiquitinated and subsequently targeted to the proteasome
for degradation remains unknown. In addition, it is unknown if these alkylated products are responsible for the
parasite proteasome inhibition observed with DHA. Proteasome inhibition will lead to buildup of proteins that
activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). In this regard, we observe that early parasite responses dictate
eventual outcomes. Artemisinin-sensitive (ART-S) parasites demonstrate hyperactivation of the UPR at early
ring stages and a subsequent inability to recover from UPR activation. Collectively, these data led us to
hypothesize that a functional ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is necessary for ART-R. In Aim 1, we examine
the role of the proteasome in ART-R. We will determine whether alkylated proteins are ubiquitinated and whether
DHA-mediated alkylation inhibits the proteasome. In Aim 2, we examine the role of ubiquitination in ART-R. We
will identify and interrogate the role of distinct ubiquitin branch patterns in conferring artemisinin survival. In Aim
3, we will determine if dysregulation of the UPS and UPR are generalities underlying artemisinin susceptibility.
We will examine African parasites that are isogenic for mutations in coronin, AP2µ, and UBP1, proteins involved
in endocytosis and ubiquitination that have been confirmed by gene editing to mediate ART-R, thus extending
the implications of our earlier findings. An understanding of the molecular underpinnings of DHA and proteasome
inhibitor synergy could extend the clinical utility of artemisinins, support proteasome inhibitor-based combination
therapies, and lead to development of other antimalarials that perturb parasite proteostasis. The proposal aims
to address knowledge gaps in parasite proteostasis with the intent of leveraging this knowledge for development
of therapeutics to combat ART-R malaria."

the participation and retention of undergraduate students from UR groups in biomedical sciences research
through training opportunities that prepare them for advanced degree programs in the biomedical sciences. To
accomplish our goal, we will pursue the following specific objectives: (1) Enhance the biomedical sciences
research skills of U-RISE trainees; (2) Promote the development of essential supplementary skills in research
through training opportunities in written and oral presentations and research design and methodologies; (3)
Create a sense of community and belonging among U-RISE trainees who identify as researchers in biomedical
sciences; and (4) Develop and prepare U-RISE trainees to be competitive candidates for advanced biomedical
degree programs. The current proposal is modeled on the successful implementation of the RISE
undergraduate training program that has been funded at UTEP since 2004. In this proposal, we request to train
25 junior or senior UR undergraduates per year. The U-RISE trainees will receive enhanced mentorship and
guidance from the PDs who will counsel them at important junctures and checkpoints during their
undergraduate careers. The trainees will also have access to new courses and training workshops that will
make them more aware of biomedical research as a career, improve their science identity, and provide them
with the technical skills and knowledge needed to be competitive for biomedical graduate programs. The
expected outcomes of U-RISE at UTEP are as follows: all trainees will participate in mentored research
projects and extramural summer research training programs; all trainees will write a research paper suitable for
publication; 80% of the trainees will graduate with a 3.5 or higher GPA; and ultimately 75% of trainees will
enroll in an advanced degree program in the biomedical sciences. It is our expectation that upon achieving the
proposed objectives, the U-RISE program UTEP will continue to generate a highly talented pool of UR trainees
with a genuine interest in pursuing advanced biomedical degrees and future research careers."

The overarching goal of this project is to improve the reproducibility of quantitative MRI (qMRI).
Secondary goals are to enhance its sensitivity and specificity, and to enable its utilization in clinical
routine imaging by reducing the scan time. Successful completion of this project will help towards the
fulfillment of qMRI's promise to objectify the radiologists' analysis and to improve the comparability of
different scans, which is much needed in the age of large multi-center studies, artificial intelligence, and
precision medicine.
It is well-known that estimates of spin relaxation times for biological tissue vary substantially throughout
the literature, in particular if different pulse sequences are used for their measurement. Our central
hypothesis is that this variability is a result of model oversimplifications, as un-modeled effects bias the
parameter estimates and this bias depends on the sequence. Simple models are commonly chosen for
in vivo qMRI to keep the scan time clinically feasible. This project aims to overcome this variability by
removing the most severe model oversimplifications, and we will enable an efficient encoding of the
more complex model with the ""hybrid state,"" a spin-ensemble state whose discovery we recently
reported in Nature Communications Physics. Our preliminary data suggests that the hybrid state allows
us to disentangle different T1-relaxation paths, on a voxel-by-voxel basis and within a clinically feasible
scan time, and we find that magnetization transfer plays a dominant role in T1-relaxation in brain white
matter.
The three specific aims concern the physics, bio-medical, and the engineering aspects of the project
and will jointly establish the proposed model and hybrid-state pulse sequence for robust and fast
quantitative MRI. We aim to provide an improved understanding of multi-component T1-relaxation in
biological tissue and the clinical implications thereof, as well as to develop tools for quantifying the
developed biomarkers in a clinical imaging setting.
While this work is relevant to the entire field of biomedical MR, the project focuses on neuroimaging,
where the relevant biophysics in best understood; and we will use multiple sclerosis as a test-vehicle
for our model and pulse sequence, as the bio-medical interpretation of the physical parameters is well
understood."
10803557,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Precise temporal regulation of stage-specific gene expression is fundamental for the proper
development of all organisms. Different molecular mechanisms that ensure the regionalized activation of gene
expression, such as activator gradients or localized transcriptional repressors, have been elucidated in
remarkable detail; however, the structural features of cis-regulatory sequences that enable transcription factors
to achieve the timely deployment of their downstream genes remain mostly unclear. The evolutionarily
conserved transcription factor Brachyury provides an example of a regulator that controls the spatial and
temporal expression of a large number of genes, many of which are required for the development of the
notochord. The notochord is the main feature shared by all chordate embryos, from tunicates to humans.
During the early embryogenesis of all chordates, the notochord provides support and patterning signals to the
developing body and is indispensable for patterning neural tube, endoderm, paraxial mesoderm, and the
structures that they will form.
 In the tunicate Ciona, an invertebrate chordate, Brachyury is exclusively expressed in notochord cells,
where it controls the expression of hundreds of genes. Even though Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) is steadily
transcribed and transported to the nuclei of the notochord cells throughout development, the genes
downstream of Ci-Bra exhibit a distinctive, temporally staggered onset. In an effort to identify the cis-regulatory
strategies responsible for the precise temporal regulation of notochord gene expression by Ci-Bra, we have
characterized several cis-regulatory regions (aka enhancers) that control the notochord expression of Ci-Bra-
downstream genes characterized by different temporal onsets. These studies have led us to formulate a
working hypothesis that explains how Brachyury controls its early-, middle- and late-onset target genes. This
hypothesis will be tested through the following experimental approaches: the elucidation of the cis-regulatory
principles underlying the sequential activation of early-onset and middle-onset notochord genes directly
controlled by Ci-Bra (Aim 1); the functional analysis of two transcription factors that activate expression of late-
onset notochord genes (Aim 2); the exploration of the role of transcriptional repressors in notochord
development (Aim 3).
 These studies will shed light on the modalities employed by a pivotal transcription factor to set the
temporal context for developmental processes of widespread relevance, such as convergent extension and
extracellular matrix secretion, and will provide the mechanistic framework that is needed to diagnose and
prevent malformations and tumorigenesis associated with the multifaceted transcription factor Brachyury."
10803641,"Physical activity (PA) has been linked to health in many epidemiological studies. Physical
inactivity and sedentary behavior are known risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD),
which is the leading cause of death in the United States with more than half a million deaths
among older Americans annually. The relationship between PA and CVD has been
investigated with an increasing emphasis on objectively measured PA using accelerometer-
based activity trackers. Past analyses of accelerometer-measured PA rely heavily on cut-
point based summary metrics that aggregate minute-level PA records into day-level metrics.
However, this aggregate approach loses valuable information on the temporal dependence
of activity levels, and important diurnal patterns of PA are thus lost to subsequent analyses.
 In this project we propose to use a novel functional data analysis framework based
on Riemann manifold model to obtain deeper insights into the role of longitudinal changes in
PA in CVD prevention. Leveraging the highly diverse Women’s Health Initiative Strong &
Healthy (WHISH) trial data, which includes a unique longitudinal substudy on accelerometer-
measured PA, and our strong capacity in statistical methodology development, our overall
objectives in the proposed study are to: 1. elucidate effects of longitudinal changes in PA
diurnal patterns on CVD incidence using the novel Riemann manifold framework; 2. examine
the effectiveness of new metrics derived from our Riemann manifold model in characterizing
longitudinal changes in PA, and 3. further develop statistical and machine learning tools for
longitudinal accelerometer-measured PA. With the proposed study we will address the
deficiencies in current analysis of longitudinal accelerometer-measured PA and its
association with CVD and advance in both statistical methodology and analysis of the role of
longitudinal changes in PA in health. Knowledge of important PA patterns in the prevention
of CVD will also be immensely useful in designing effective interventions to promote healthy
PA habits in CVD prevention."
10803713,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) outcomes in children with advanced stage disease are markedly inferior to
those in children with early-stage disease. eBL is one of the most rapidly growing tumors. As a result, diagnostic
delays of days-to-weeks contribute to late presentations, and directly affect stage and curability of disease. BL
is the most common childhood cancer in Uganda. A child with a large jaw mass will be readily recognized as
having eBL, and will typically be treated before histologic confirmation. However, a child with a lesser jaw
swelling, or an abdominal mass, may be treated with empiric antimicrobials or observed for weeks. Even after
procedures are performed for suspected BL, final histopathology is typically not available for another two weeks.
 EBV is consistently associated with eBL, and is detectable in blood and saliva of eBL patients. Although EBV
DNA holds promise as an early detection marker for eBL, diagnostic utility is limited by poor specificity. EBV
DNA not related to tumor is present in blood in a small fraction of latently infected normal lymphocytes and EBV
virions may be present in plasma. EBV virions are also frequently detectable in saliva. We hypothesize that the
specificity for malignancy would be markedly enhanced by enriching specimens for circulating tumor-derived
EBV DNA. This may be accomplished by modifying preanalytical variables in specimen preparation, including
upfront cell stabilization to limit viral DNA leakage from latently infected cells, elimination of normal lymphocytes
(and epithelial cells in saliva) that may harbor latent EBV DNA, and enrichment for CpG methylated DNA, which
effectively reduces virion DNA since that is never CpG methylated. Enrichment for methylated EBV DNA is a
particularly innovative approach to improve assay specificity. We will test these hypotheses in two aims. In Aim
1 (blood), PBMC-derived viral DNA will be reduced by analyzing plasma, as opposed to whole blood or buffy
coat cells, collected in cell-stabilizing tubes to minimize ex vivo cell lysis. Virion EBV DNA will be excluded via
CpG methylated DNA separation. The effect of specimen transport temperature, time, and other preanalytical
variables on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) recovery and EBV DNA measurements will be evaluated. In Aim 2 (saliva),
collection techniques that minimize oral epithelial cells and lymphocytes and minimize ex vivo cell lysis along
with exclusion of virion EBV DNA will be assessed. The effect of specimen transport temperature, time, and
additive on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) recovery and EBV DNA measurements will be also be evaluated. These
studies aim to define the optimal specimen preparation methods that will be feasible in African settings, and
elsewhere, and can serve as the basis for future standards for the biospecimen science community at large.
Improved diagnostic specificity of EBV DNA measurements achieved by optimizing preanalytical
procedures should translate directly into earlier diagnoses and higher cure rates for eBL. Improved
specimen handling also has the potential to improve eBL treatment monitoring, and could extrapolate to the
diagnosis/monitoring of other EBV-associated malignancies."
10802935,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is a fundamental gap in the mechanistic understanding of the optokinetic reflex (OKR), used in the clinic
to diagnose a variety of visual and neurological disorders. The OKR provides a unique system in which the visual
system input, and eye movement output, are well-controlled and quantifiable, and the information bottleneck at
dedicated ganglion cell types is accessible. The long-term goals are to reveal the mechanistic basis of the OKR
from the molecular programming of circuit wiring to computations to stimulus (in)dependence and to translate
this knowledge into diagnostics. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine how the individual and
population properties of two specific ganglion cell types influence eye movements. This proposal’s focus is on
the vertical OKR, which is subserved by up/Superior and down/Inferior preferring ON direction selective ganglion
cells (Superior and Inferior oDSGCs). Preliminary work leads to a central hypothesis: The vertical OKR is
influenced by properties that can be traced to retinal direction selective circuits and specifically, motion encoding
in Superior and Inferior oDSGCs individually and as a population. Previous studies show that the OKR is contrast
sensitive and asymmetric, with higher gain in the up vs. down directions. Differences in intrinsic properties, e.g.,
dendritic morphology, and synaptic inputs can explain these phenomena with contrast sensitive spike tuning
curves and greater responses in Superior vs. Inferior oDSGCs. Recent single-cell sequencing supports the
asymmetry with identification of differentially expressed genes in Superior vs. Inferior oDSGCs, including
molecular guidance cues that could be integral to the development of direction selective circuits. We propose to
examine the fundamental molecular and computational mechanisms that support and preserve the vertical OKR
across diverse stimulus statistics. We will achieve this by (1) using mouse genetics to elucidate the molecular
processes that construct and maintain direction selective circuitry, and (2) measuring oDSGC population
responses and OKR in the context of stimulus perturbations including noise. (Aim 1) Identify essential signaling
pathways for the development of direction selective circuits and the OKR, and (Aim 2) Elucidate the mechanisms
of noise correlations among populations of oDSGCs and their impact on the OKR. The aims will be accomplished
by using stimulus manipulations, genetic perturbations, cellular physiology, circuit mapping, and computational
modeling to identify characteristics of the reflex, their potential mechanistic basis, and their stability or adaptability
under different visual environments. The expected outcomes for Aim 1 will be a concise link between molecules,
retinal circuits, and behavior, and for Aim 2 will be insight into how stimulus statistics, including noise correlations,
influence behavior. The proposed work is significant because it will reveal—from molecules to behavior—how
cells, circuits, computations, and their behavioral output operate in health and change in disease in an
evolutionarily conserved system with the potential for clinical application of knowledge gained in this proposal."
10802938,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Juxtaglomerular (JG) cells are a cluster of specialized vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells located in the wall of
each afferent arteriole (Af-Art) at the entrance to the glomerulus. On one hand, JG cells preserve most of the
characteristics of VSM cells, but on the other hand, they are distinguished from VSM cells by their unique
endocrine characteristics, specifically the synthesis and secretion of renin. Renin released from JG cells into the
circulation catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, the first and rate-limiting step of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) cascade. Commensurate with the central role of RAAS in fluid
and electrolyte homeostasis, renin synthesis and secretion by JG cells is regulated by multiple inputs that
generally reflect the status of extracellular fluid volume. The most important among the control mechanisms of
renin release is a pressure-sensing mechanism, denominated as the intrarenal baroreceptor. It is believed that
JG cells can detect slight changes in perfusion pressure through the Af-Art and respond with precise amounts
of renin synthesized and secreted to the circulation in sync, therefore functioning as a mechano-sensitive
rheostat to maintain a steady-state level of Af-Art perfusion pressure and thus systemic blood pressure. However,
the nature of the intrarenal baroreceptor and in particular, the central questions about this pressure-sensing
mechanism: what the exact mechano-sensor is in JG cells and how it controls renin synthesis and secretion,
remain elusive. A novel technique, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), provides a new tool to further
understand the genetic and molecular basis of the intrarenal baroreceptor in JG cells. Our preliminary studies of
scRNA-seq analysis have revealed that a gene Sdc1 is not only highly and differentially expressed in JG cells
vs. VSM cells, but also positively correlated with Ren1 expression. Sdc1 encodes syndecan-1, a transmembrane
proteoglycan, which allows for the transfer of information about extracellular environment changes into the cell
that consequently affects intracellular activities. Thus, in this project, we aim to determine whether syndecan-1
is a key mechano-sensor of the intrarenal baroreceptor mechanism in JG cells that controls renin synthesis and
secretion, regulates the circulating RAAS, and thus contributes to the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte
homeostasis and blood pressure. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine the expression of syndecan-1 in the
kidney, especially in JG cells; moreover, we will examine the effects of different perfusion pressures on the renin
mRNA and protein expression levels in JG cells with the in vitro model of isolated/perfused juxtaglomerular
apparatus and in vivo model of aortic coarctation in wild-type (WT), global Sdc1 knockout (KO), and JG cell-
specific Sdc1KO mice. In Aim 2, we will examine the volume depletion (low perfusion pressure) or volume
expansion (high perfusion pressure)-induced changes in the renin expression levels in JG cells, circulating levels
of RAAS, renal vascular resistance, urinary sodium excretion, and blood pressure in WT, global Sdc1KO, and
JG cell-specific Sdc1KO mice."
10802605,"SUMMARY: Two ancestry-associated coding variants in APOL1 drive much of the racial disparity in rates of
kidney disease. However, the presence of two risk alleles (a high-risk genotype) does not lead to kidney disease
in all or even most individuals, indicating that other factors must also be important. Several environmental 2nd
hits have been identified such as HIV, therapeutic interferon, and Covid19. APOL1 itself is an innate immune
factor induced by interferons. A unifying theme is that both the APOL1 high-risk genotype and factors that elevate
APOL1 expression are required for development of APOL1 kidney disease. In addition to APOL1 protein function
as a membrane pore, APOL1 mRNA 3’-UTR has inversely oriented alu repeats that form a hairpin loop of double-
stranded RNA (dsRNA). This loop acts as an inflammatory factor because dsRNA is recognized by pattern
recognition receptors (PRR). Activation of PRR induces an anti-viral state with production of additional
interferons, which can trigger more APOL1 expression in a vicious cycle. Several mechanisms act as brakes on
APOL1 activity to prevent excess toxicity including transcript repression by miRNA and prevention of the PRR
inflammatory response by the A-to-I editing enzyme ADAR. We believe that imbalance between APOL1
activation and suppression may trigger kidney disease. To continue these studies, we will now: (1) Examine how
miRNA activity at the APOL1 3-’UTR regulates APOL1 expression. miRNA regulate gene expression by binding
to mRNA (usually 3’-UTR), promoting its degradation. We identified ~80 miRNAs in a high-throughput screen
with the potential to reduce APOL1 mRNA levels. We will perform a counterscreen to identify the most potent
miRNA at preventing APOL1 upregulation by interferons. We will find the intersection between miRNA expressed
in the podocyte and those that repress APOL1. We will test whether human polymorphisms in the APOL1 3’-
UTR alter miRNA binding and gene expression. We will validate the most relevant miRNA in vivo in APOL1 BAC
transgenic mice. (2) Characterize environmental and endogenous factors that induce or modify APOL1
expression. We will test a wide range of exogenous and endogenous molecules for their ability to induce APOL1
expression and to modulate cytokine-driven APOL1 expression. We will test the most potent molecules in APOL1
BAC transgenic mice. (3) Examine the role of APOL1 mRNA as an innate immune signaling molecule. We will
determine the specific PRR that recognize APOL1 3’-UTR dsRNA and whether that recognition and the resulting
inflammation depends on APOL1 genotype. We will assess how A-to-I editing of the APOL1 3’-UTR by ADAR
or protection by mRNA binding proteins may prevent the inflammatory loop driven by PRR recognition of APOL1
mRNA. We will test the effect of ADAR editing on the stability of the APOL1 mRNA and how A-to-I editing alters
3’-UTR binding by miRNA. Together, these experiments will help us understand the positive and negative factors
that regulate the interferon-driven APOL1 feed-forward inflammatory loop, APOL1 expression levels, and
podocyte injury leading to kidney disease."
10802441,"Preventive interventions with minoritized families have rarely included content to promote ethnic-racial 
socialization (i.e., how families teach their children about the values, traditions, and practices associated with 
their ethnic-racial group). Ethnic-racial socialization plays a key role in mitigating the negative effects of racism 
on health outcomes and in contributing to children’s social-emotional functioning and healthy-lifestyle 
behaviors. This omission represents a crucial gap that may be limiting the engagement, reach, and impact of 
preventive interventions with minoritized families. Furthermore, the prevention and family intervention fields 
have focused on either social-emotional functioning or healthy lifestyle behaviors, rather than integrating the 
two domains. Addressing each domain in a separate intervention misses the synergistic effects and is less cost 
effective than tackling both domains using a single, integrated intervention. To address these gaps, the main 
objective of this project is to test whether providing parenting support, with an added emphasis on ethnic-racial 
socialization and healthy lifestyle behaviors, improves the social-emotional functioning and healthy lifestyle 
behaviors of Black and Latinx children ages 3-6. The guiding hypothesis is that incorporating these 
components into a parenting intervention will lead to improvements in children’s health as compared to a 
control condition. This pilot project is novel in that it (a) interweaves positive parenting practices, ethnic-racial 
socialization, and healthy lifestyle behaviors into a prevention program for Black and Latinx families, and (b) 
targets preschool aged children using a brief, universal prevention approach, which increases potential for 
dissemination and scalability. A type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design is used to simultaneously 
test intervention effectiveness while also gathering information on intervention delivery to inform future 
implementation trials. The specific aims are to: (a) test the preliminary effects of a preventive intervention on 
the social-emotional functioning and healthy lifestyle behaviors of Black and Latinx children, (b) identify the 
preliminary effects of the intervention on parenting outcomes, and (c) examine potential barriers and facilitators 
to intervention delivery. The expected contribution of this project is to provide important foundational 
knowledge regarding whether ethnic-racial socialization and healthy lifestyle behaviors can be integrated into a 
brief parenting intervention to enhance minoritized children’s physical and emotional health. This contribution is 
significant because it can lead to advancements in prevention efforts focused on improving child health-related 
outcomes, potentially decreasing health disparities for minoritized children."
10802442,"Healthy sleep is pivotal for children’s development. Sleep problems (i.e., late bedtime, insufficient sleep, 
inconsistent sleep patterns) can lead to impaired cognition, behavioral difficulties, decrement in academic 
performance, and increased risk of developing obesity. Developing healthy sleep habits is especially important 
for 4–6-year-olds as routines shift when children transition from variable preschool environments to a more 
structured elementary school setting. However, few studies have harnessed the unique partnerships between 
teachers and parents in preventing suboptimal child sleep. Therefore, innovative strategies are needed to target 
healthy sleep development – which may provide benefit across multiple domains ultimately enhancing children’s 
sleep behavior and daytime functioning in the classroom (e.g., attention, disruptive behavior, prosocial behavior). 
This project builds upon the Developmental Ecological Transition to Kindergarten model, which posits that 
supportive alignment across settings (i.e., home and school) is essential for child well-being during transitions 
into school. Guided by the ORBIT intervention development framework to systematically co-develop a schooland 
home-based sleep promotion intervention with key stakeholders (kindergarten teachers and parents), this 
project refines a sleep promotion intervention for kindergarten children via teacher and parent focus groups (Aim 
1), tests the intervention strategies for proof-of-concept in a single group design (Aim 2, n=1 school), and pilot 
tests the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary signal of effect in a randomized controlled trial (Aim 3, n=4 
schools). In Aims 2 and 3, data are collected on feasibility and acceptability (via observation and self-report), 
child sleep (via wrist-worn accelerometry), and child classroom behavior (via teacher report). The project will 
provide critical data for the development of a fully powered trial designed to simultaneously improve children’s 
sleep and social-emotional well-being around the time of school entry."

The negative health burden of obesity leads to an estimated 500,000 deaths in the United States
annually. Obesity and related metabolic disorders are caused by the excess consumption of
palatable, densely caloric foods. People with obesity have diminished reward from food. Although the
taste of food can elicit a rewarding feeling, the intestine is required for food reward. How the gut
signals this reward to the brain is unknown. My long-term career goal is the document the physiologic
regulation of food intake for better treatment of obesity. With the support of the NIH Mentored
Research Scientist Development Award – K01, the objective of this proposal is to define the role of a
specialized intestinal sensory cell in food reward and obesity. This proposal is built on recent
fundamental discoveries that have established how nutrient choice is guided by specialized neuropod
cells in the duodenum. Building on these observations, the objectives of this proposal are three-fold:
(1) to establish the role of duodenal neuropod cells in reward-driven feeding; (2) map the functional
brain targets of duodenal neuropod cells; and (3) determine the effects of duodenal neuropod cells on
hyperphagia and obesity. Defining how reward is signaled from the gut to the brain to guide ingestive
behavior will allow for novel pharmacotherapies for the treatment of obesity. Together with my
mentoring team, we have designed this project to provide me with the necessary research and
professional training for me to excel as an independent investigator at the intersection of
gastroenterology and neuroscience."
10784911,"ABSTRACT
Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are key components of the tumor microenvironment and are
associated with immunosuppression, poor prognosis and an inadequate response to immune checkpoint
therapy (ICT) in different types of tumors. Reprogramming of TAMs towards a more phagocytic and “type 1”
pro-inflammatory phenotype can improve tumor control. Thus, several molecules associated with the
immunosuppressive phenotype in TAMs have been targeted in both tumor models and patients, alone or in
combination with ICT. Recently, we showed that the human inhibitory receptor ILT3, also known as LILRB4,
is an attractive target for TAM reprogramming in tumor therapy. We found that ILT3 is highly expressed in
TAMs in various types of cancer. Moreover, we discovered that ILT3 recognizes fibronectin (Fn), which is
ubiquitously expressed in the extracellular matrix and enriched in various primary tumors and metastatic
sites. ILT3-Fn interaction polarizes macrophages and other myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells and
monocytes, towards an immunosuppressive state, which debilitates their capacity to stimulate and activate
T cells. Thus, the ILT3-Fn axis is a mechanism underlying stromal-driven inhibition of anti-tumor activity that
represents a promising target to promote reprogramming of TAMs and myeloid cells in general in cancer. In
this grant application we propose to determine the impact of ILT3 blockade on the control of primary and
metastatic tumor models in vivo with a specific monoclonal antibody, mAb1, that blocks ILT3Fn interaction.
Since ILT3 is a human receptor with a distantly related mouse paralogue, studying its function in vivo has
been difficult. To date, the evidence of ILT3 immunosuppressive activity is based on expression data in
human samples and in vitro assays, while the in vivo impact of ILT3 on myeloid cell functions and anti-tumor
activity remains to be elucidated. To overcome this issue, we generated a transgenic mouse that carries a
bacterial artificial chromosome encompassing a portion of human chromosome 19 that contains the ILT3
gene, together with its putative regulatory regions. Analysis of ILT3 expression in this mouse demonstrated
a pattern consistent with that in humans among different tissues. In specific aim 1, we will test the impact of
ILT3 blockade on tumor growth and anti-tumor immune responses in two models of sarcoma and colorectal
carcinoma in vivo. We will further test the ability of ILT3 blockade to restore an effective response to ICT in
a model of ICT resistance. In specific aim 2, we will test the impact of ILT3 blockade on the composition of
pre-metastatic and metastatic niches in two models of lung metastases and, ultimately, on the formation of
metastatic lesions. This proposal will advance our knowledge of the mechanisms regulating the immune
landscape in primary and metastatic tumors and validate the anti-human ILT3 mAb as a therapeutic agent
that can be brought to the clinic, either alone or in association with ICT."

Global change, including climate warming and human population increases and movement, has facilitated
range-expansion of arthropod vectors of human pathogens, with mosquitoes, bugs, and ticks increasingly being
reported outside their historic ranges. Concomitantly, there has been an explosive expansion of vector-borne
disease agents, especially obligate intracellular bacteria transmitted by ticks including the recently described
human anaplasmosis agent, Anaplasma phagoctophilum (Ap) that causes a severe and potentially life-
threatening illness. Progress in our understanding of this and related organisms has been hindered by the
inherent difficulties with manipulation of obligate intracellular bacteria in the order Rickettsiales. Moreover,
over 30% of their encoded genes have no matches in the databases, and are thus of unknown function. While
bioinformatics algorithms offer an approach to predict form and function, these predictions are unreliable. At
the same time, uptake of existing genetic systems has been slow, in part due to their limitations. To alleviate this
situation, we propose to employ a modified himar1 transposon-transposase system that enables efficient
replacement of the transposon with another cassette containing a wild-type copy of the mutated gene using
recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE), a well-established molecular technique, to restore gene
function. We will accomplish our planned projects following four specific aims: Aim 1: Generate a collection of
Ap mutants recovered in tick vector and human host cell culture using the himar1 transposon system where the
transposon is designed with flanking mis-matched lox sequences to allow subsequent replacement of the
transposon using RMCE. Aim 2: Determine insertion sites using whole genome sequencing. This will be
facilitated through the use of the Ap-HGE1 isolate for which the genome sequence is available. Aims 1 and 2 will
be carried out during the Phase I (R61) component of the application, and set the stage/provide the mutants for
the subsequent Aims 3 and 4, which will occupy the Phase II (R33) component of the award. Aim 3: Test
infectivity of selected mutants and of genetically “restored” mutants in vitro using multiple tick and mammalian
cell lines, and verify gene knock-out/knock-in using RT-PCR to demonstrate absence and restored presence of
transcripts, and immune-assays to demonstrate absence/restored presence of gene products. Mutants of interest
will be selected for RMCE to restore gene function, and successful RMCE will be verified using site-specific PCR
and Sanger sequencing coupled with assessment of restored phenotype. Aim 4: Test infectivity of selected
mutants and of genetically “restored” mutants in vivo in ticks and mice, including tick transmission studies."

 In the past 8 years, we have studied a cohort of youth from metropolitan Detroit to investigate the effects of
psychosocial stressors and resources on health, with a speciﬁc focus on asthma symptoms (Asthma in the Lives
Of Families Today, ALOFT study). Our preliminary results from bulk RNA-seq analysis in peripheral leukocytes
demonstrate that psychosocial factors are associated with transcriptional changes for a large number of genes,
many of them involved in immunological functions. Importantly, we and others have uncovered an important role
for blood cell type composition in inter-individual variation in response to psychosocial environments and their
effects on immunological health and asthma symptoms. Here, we propose 1) to disentangle the contribution of
psychosocial factors and asthmatic state on patterns of transcriptional dysregulation; 2) to investigate the effects
of psychosocial factors on transcriptional regulation in blood cell type subpopulations; and 3) to determine the
role of genetic variation in modulating these effects and their consequences for asthmatic children's health. To
this end, we will use a combination of bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing on immune cells collected from
children with asthma and their asymptomatic siblings. The complementary expertise of our team will uncover
speciﬁc genetic and psychosocial factors associated with increased risk for poor physical health and wellbeing.
These results will be important to design personalized medical and behavioral interventions to alleviate disease
severity in children with asthma."

Environmental hazards are more likely to be located near low-income communities of color. These hazards
are amplified by negative socioeconomic and health factors, including higher rates of chronic diseases, lack of
access to healthy foods, substandard housing, racism, poverty, unemployment, lack of greenspace, community
violence, and zoning incompatibilities. Understanding the role of environmental health in observed community
disparities is fundamentally important to helping communities deliver on the promise of an improved quality of
life for its people. Direct community engagement in identifying, developing, and evaluating these relationships
is critical to improving health equity. To help develop sustainable solutions, we propose to launch the
“Environmental Health MethodologicAl, Training, and Teaching EnterpRiSe” (EH MATTERS) program at USC.
EH MATTERS will (1) help foster a new generation of diverse environmental health scientists to improve the
current environmental landscape that contributes to disparate health burdens; (2) develop approaches to
identify and evaluate environmental health disparities; (3) build skills in community-engaged research and
research translation to improve public health. EH MATTERS will leverage the diverse student body at the
University of Southern California to engage students in robust and diverse interdisciplinary training and
research experiences. This will provide them with needed skills to meaningfully contribute to improving
community environmental health status through an integrated research and education training program.
Outcomes from these efforts will ignite interest in key areas of health research that disproportionately impact
communities of color. Through successive two-year training cycles, up to half a dozen motivated
undergraduate students per year from underrepresented minority groups (URGs) will be enrolled into a two-
year program to develop the tools needed to ultimately build environmental social capital in their respective
neighborhoods and communities. EH MATTERS is built upon a framework of didactic seminars, hands-on

10804814,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disabling autoimmune disease affecting individuals in their most productive
years and is also prevalent among US Veterans. MS is caused by abnormal activation of myelin-specific
autoreactive T and B cells and their CNS infiltration. At present, there is no cure for MS and the treatments for
MS involve a diverse array of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) targeting autoimmunity but with relatively
little or no effects on the CNS disease of MS as the disease progression continues.
Recently, anti-CD20-based B cell-depleting therapy has been approved for the treatment of MS. B cells
participate in the autoimmune process by presenting autoantigens and producing autoantibodies. B cells also
regulate T cell-mediated autoimmune responses by producing effector (IL-6) or regulatory (IL-10) cytokines. B
cell depletion is known to inhibit TH1 and TH17 cell immune responses in MS patients and in its animal models
(experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; EAE), a mechanism of B cell depletion therapy. B cell depletion
therapy, however, suffers from potential adverse effects, such as opportunistic infections and the generation
of neutralizing antibodies as well as low efficacy. Mechanistically, anti-CD20-antibodies depleting effector B
cells also deplete the regulatory B cells, thus causing loss of regulatory B cell function for inhibition and
recovery of MS/EAE disease. This underscores the need for a new therapy that selectively inhibits effector/
pathogenic functions of B cells while sparing or promoting regulatory/protective B cell functions.
 Recently, our laboratory reported a novel immunomodulatory mechanism of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO;
an endogenous S-nitrosothiol) in the EAE model. GSNO-mediated S-nitrosylation plays a critical role in
physiological nitric oxide (NO) signaling for the regulation of multiple cellular pathways. We reported that
exogenous GSNO or optimization of endogenous GSNO, by blocking its turnover using GSNO reductase
(GSNOR) inhibitor (GSNORi), attenuates the effector T cell (TH17) and effector (IL-6+) B cell functions while
increasing the regulatory T cells (Treg) and regulatory (IL-10+) B cell functions and thus protects against the
EAE disease. Based on this, we propose to investigate the preclinical therapeutic potential of GSNO/GSNORi
(S-nitrosylation)-mediated signaling mechanisms in B and T cell-mediated immunomodulation and their
potential efficacy against CNS disease using the EAE model.
Aim 1 is proposed to evaluate the preclinical therapeutic potentials of GSNOR inhibitors.
Aim 2 is proposed to investigate the mechanisms underlying GSNOR inhibitor-mediated
immunomodulation.
 The present study, based on our original contributions, investigates a novel mechanism of balanced
regulation of regulatory vs. effector functions of B cells under autoimmune disease conditions. We expect that
the proposed study will evaluate the preclinical potential of injectable (N6022) and orally active (N91115)
GSNORi for MS treatment and delineate GSNO/GSNORi-mediated mechanisms of regulatory vs. effector B
and T cell-selective immunomodulation and to gain new insights into the development of alternative therapy to
current B cell depletion therapy. We observed that human and mouse B cells share similar GSNO/GSNRi-
mediated immunomodulatory mechanisms. Therefore, we expect that the proposed study will provide
insights into the therapeutic potential of GSNORi for MS and other autoimmune diseases."
10934486,"Cardiometabolic and mental health conditions are highly prevalent and complicate management of each other
when they co-occur, leading to greater disability and healthcare costs. Such multi-comorbidity becomes even
more challenging when it intersects with racial inequities and social determinants of health culminating in
amplified risk of adverse outcomes. Successful disease management that works at the intersection of the
individual and the community must be implemented to mitigate disparities and optimal treatment must address
aspects of both cardiometabolic and mental health disorders in a culturally relevant intervention. Evidence based
interventions have not been demonstrated to be culturally relevant for resource poor minority populations. The
community perspective is likely missing in the overall care management of comorbid conditions. Scientific study
must include minorities both in the collection of data and also in the identification of community identified
variables important in successful management of comorbid conditions. Subsequently, positioning these variables
in community-generated conceptual models and then testable computer models will help to identify and highlight
key points for development of culturally relevant intervention strategies. The K01 candidate proposes a parallel,
integrated dynamic process of understanding community perspectives, analyzing risk factors and determinants,
and building and testing computer models that explain disparities and predict outcomes. Connecting the dots
between epidemiologic research and computer modeling through systems science in a community based
participatory framework will allow for the development of accurate replicable models of health disparities that are
co-built by community voices and population scientists.

10808668,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The study of African genomes is an urgent, critical need, not only to promote equity but also as a scientific
imperative. Prior studies have included mostly individuals from Western, Central, or Southern Africa, and a
major gap is the lack of cohorts from East Africa, who likely have unique demographic history, allele frequency
spectrum and linkage disequilibrium patterns. The Somalis are a distinct East African population group who
have not been part of genomic medicine research initiatives.
Due to political instability, many Somalis emigrated to the United States, with the largest number living in
Southeast Minnesota. Using a community based participatory research framework to guide efforts, we
engaged with the Somali community including tribal elders, imams, and healthcare workers, as well as
representative community-based organizations (e.g., Somali Health Advisory Committee, Pamoja Women) and
noted the community’s enthusiasm to engage in genomic medicine research. Our proposed research will
enable a research partnership with an underserved population of East African origin to establish a genomic
medicine research program in this understudied community. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1.
(a) Expand a community based participatory genomic medicine research effort in the Somali community of
Southeast Minnesota. We will be guided by a Community Advisory Board with diverse representation; (b)
Create a biobank of 1000 Somali individuals that includes plasma, DNA, and RNA. Clinical variables and social
determinants of health will be obtained from the electronic health record and surveys. Aim 2. (a) Perform
population genetics analyses of whole genome sequencing (30x) data, to investigate the demographic history
of the Somali population. We will use a graph genome reference based on African sequences from the
Pangenome Consortium, instead of the linear GRCh38, for more accurate variant calling; (b) Use population
genetics data to inform construction of polygenic scores for biologically relevant quantitative traits, starting with
lipid levels, height, and body mass index. Aim 3. (a) Identify actionable variants in medically relevant genes
(ACMG Secondary Findings v3.0) as well as select pharmacogenomic variants; (b) Return actionable results
based on input from the community and participant choice and assess near term outcomes.
By conducting research in a unique and understudied racial/ethnic group, the proposed work will extend our
knowledge of African genomes, help lessen disparities in genomic medicine and provide novel insights that are
relevant to diverse populations."
10812341,"Appalachian Gerontology Experiences: Advancing Diversity in Aging Research
(AGE-ADAR)
Specific Aims
Appalachia is a predominantly rural area in which 25 million Americans reside. The region
includes all of West Virginia and portions of 12 other states. Relative to the rest of the United
States, West Virginian Appalachia is rugged and mountainous, which creates geographic
barriers to medical and psychosocial services. Residents of the region also live with lower
annual incomes, higher poverty, higher unemployment, and higher morbidity and mortality rates
than other areas of the nation (Appalachian Regional Commission, 2017). Thus, it is a region
marked by significant health disparities.
Health disparities are more pronounced in the rural areas of Appalachia and are a complex
result of health behaviors, personal resources, and macro-environmental influences. Although
rural-dwelling adults have many of the same needs as adults aging in other environments, there
are unique issues presented by a rural context. Thus, as we have argued elsewhere, aging is
harder in rural areas (Hash, Jurkowski, & Krout, 2015). For many Appalachian residents, there
is a strong sense of place-identity, with an historical mistrust of “outsiders” who often lack the
cultural competence to address the nuances and complexities of Appalachian culture. Thus,
what is needed is a cadre of health professionals and researchers who are well-versed in
the science of aging, the science of health disparities, and the culture of Appalachia. To that
end, we propose a highly-scaffolded education experience to increase interest in and diversity
among researchers in aging and health disparities in Appalachia.
The overarching goals of this project align with the goals of the NIA to increase interest in
reducing health disparities and increasing the representation of historically underrepresented
scholars in the fields of aging and health disparities research. To accomplish these goals, the
proposed educational program would provide: focused educational content on research
methods, aging, health disparities, Appalachia and other rural areas. The program would
include structured, hands-on research experiences and mentored research experiences. We
would nurture an appreciation for applied/translational research and community-based
dissemination, thus increasing the health literacy and scientific literacy in the region.
Together, these experiences would prepare scholars to infuse a healthy aging approach to
their work. Specifically, the proposed program would:
1. provide culturally- and regionally-relevant educational content on aging, health
disparities, Appalachia and other rural areas;
2. provide an intensive introduction to research methods, including completion of at least
 one structured group research experience focused on health disparities and a second
mentored, health-related aging research experience with a faculty sponsor in the
student's home discipline;
3. create and reinforce an identity of being an aging and health disparities researcher who
will contribute to the research workforce in aging;
4. coach students on scientific writing and professional development; and
5. increase scientific and health literacy in the community through broad dissemination of
research findings."
10811135,"Project Summary
 HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) causes the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV/AIDS
is one of the most serious public health challenges in the world. Early diagnosis of HIV can improve health
outcome and reduce HIV transmission effectively. Currently nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are the common methods for HIV detection. However, they can
be only performed by professionals in a central laboratory. There is an essential need for development of point-
of-care (POC) tools for early HIV detection. The p24 antigen is a protein biomarker that can be used for early
detection. However, current POC testing tools have a poor limit of detection (LOD) toward p24 detection, which
cannot be used for testing HIV within less than two weeks of post-infection
 The objective of this project is to develop a paper-based lateral flow strip (PLFS) for rapid, in-field
detection of the p24 antigen in finger-prick whole blood samples. A plasmon-enhanced fluorescent sensor will
be developed by utilizing a hierarchical three-dimensional nano-architecture. The chip-based fluorescent
sensor and a plasma-separation unit will be integrated into a single paper-based microfluidic strip to enable
blood sample pretreatment, fluid transport and analyte detection. The performance of the integrated PLFS will
be tested in terms of limit of detection, sensitivity, selectivity and applicability to clinical patient samples.
 This need-driven work capitalizes on the expertise and skills of a multidisciplinary project team in device
development, statistical modeling, medicine, HIV biology and clinical diagnosis. The discovery-driven research
is novel because of the several appealing features. That is, incorporation of a blood plasma separation unit into
the PLFS will eliminate the need of sample pretreatment in a central laboratory. The three-dimensional
plasmonic nanostructure will enhance the sensitivity of the near-infrared fluorescence sensor. The PLFS can
be read out by a commercial, battery-powered, hand-held fluorescence reader. The portable device can be
employed as a POC tool for measuring p24 antigen in finger-prick (or heel-prick) blood samples in a minimally
invasive way at home, in a clinic or other resource-limited settings. It can be used for self-testing by an
untrained lay-person, and for early infant diagnosis. The data obtained from this portable device will assist
early diagnosis of HIV within first two weeks of post-infection. Early detection of HIV infection will improve
medical intervention outcome, and reduce HIV transmission, leading to substantial reduction in HIV/AIDS-
related mortality and morbidity as well as economic costs."
10813136,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Deficits in gaze and postural stability are closely linked with vestibular hypofunction. These deficits result in
dizziness and poor balance, increasing the risk for falls and other poor health outcomes. Vestibular
hypofunction occurs with several conditions and is increasingly prevelant with advancing age. An estimated
85% of people over the age of 80 experience vestibular hypofunction. As with many age-related health
challenges (e.g. sarcopenia, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease), exercise is widely recommended to
remediate the effects of vestibular hypofunction. Vestibular rehabilitation has demonstrated efficacy at
improving vestibular hypofunction in tightly controlled clinical trials, but the effectiveness in practice is limited
by two major barriers: 1) reduced patient adherence to the exercise program, and 2) inability to precisely
assess vestibular function. These are overlapping challenges; lack of access to vestibular function
assessments impedes effective dosing of rehabilitation as well as monitoring of patient adherence and
progress. Thus, personalization and monitoring—essential ingredients of nearly any health or exercise
regimen—are functionally missing in vestibular rehabilitation practice.
 For this proposal, we have developed the Making INformed Decisions in Gaze and Postural Stability
(MINDGAPS) system, which utilizes wearable sensor technology to provide simple, precise measures of gaze
and postural stability, as well as remote monitoring of patient adherence to vestibular exercises. Additionally,
MINDGAPS leverages NIH Toolbox data to display patient status compared to normative values and to
indicate progress over time relative to measurement error. This enables the application of two innovative
behavioral science principles aimed at facilitating patient adherence: 1) social norming; comparison of a patient
to her or his peers, and 2) frequent monitoring of progress and outcomes. This study is designed to examine
the preliminary efficacy of the MINDGAPS system, along with the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of its use
in practice. We will use a single cohort, double-basline design (n=30 older adults with vestibular hypofunction).
Following, the baseline (control) phase, all participants will complete 6 weeks of individualized vestibular
rehabilitation informed by the MINDGAPS system. Preliminary efficacy of the intervention will be examined by
comparing computerized Dynamic Visual Acuity (cDVA) scores during the intervention phase to cDVA scores
during the baseline phase. Other clinical outcomes (e.g., postural stability, video-head impulse testing, patient
reported dizziness) will also be examined. Feasibility and safety of the intervention will be examined relative to
a priori thresholds for recruitment, retention and adherence rates, as well as recording of adverse events.
Finally, the acceptability and remote/telehealth capability of the system will be explored using a mixed methods
analysis, which will inform system refinement in preparation for a future R01 submission (phase II clinical trial)."
10813140,"Rod and cone photoreceptors of the vertebrate retina detect light using their outer segments, highly specialized
forms of primary cilia. Primary ciliary throughout the body play important roles in sensing the cellular
environment, and genetic deletions in their molecular components, known as ciliopathies, lead to devastating
congenital diseases, including blinding forms of retinal degeneration. The goal of this project is to develop a
thorough understanding of the structural and molecular basis of primary cilium function, with a focus on the rod
sensory cilium, and to understand the molecular mechanisms of rod cell death in ciliopathies. We have
developed and applied innovative molecular-scale imaging approaches using fluorescence and electron
microscopy to this problem, and now propose to introduce additional improvements in the imaging technology
and to use them to test hypotheses about normal ciliary structures and mechanisms, and about
pathophysiological mechanisms in animal models of retinal ciliopathies. Specific Aims: 1. Use cryo-electron
tomography (cryo-ET) and recent developments in sub-tomogram averaging to determine the three-
dimensional structure to nanometer resolution of repeating structures of the rod cell connecting cilium and
basal body, including microtubule doublets and triplets, microtubule inner proteins, “Y-shaped links”, transition
fibers and appendages. Our goal is to apply recent developments in hardware and software to rod cells in both
wild type retinas and in animal models of retinal degeneration. 2. Use superresolution fluorescence to test
hypotheses about trafficking of specific proteins and about the roles of IFT (intraflagellar transport) particles
and the BBSome (a coat-forming protein complex implicated in the blinding ciliopathy, Bardet-Biedl syndrome)
in ciliary trafficking in rods. Two-color superresolution fluorescence and quantitative interaction analysis will be
used to assess putative interactions between IFT proteins or BBS proteins and outer segment membrane
proteins, as well as well as proteins normally excluded from the outer segment which mis-accumulate there in
BBS-deficient mice. These experiments will test the hypothesis that specific membrane proteins are actively
trafficked through the connecting cilium membrane through their association with IFT particles, whereas others
are transported via alternative routes and excluded proteins are actively removed by the BBSome. 3. Use
mouse models to test the hypotheses that CEP290 is a major component of the “Y-shaped links” extending
from the ciliary axoneme to the membrane, using superresolution fluorescence, conventional TEM, and cryo-
electron tomography with timed gene disruption or gene restoration at different developmental stages to
distinguish initiating as opposed to secondary events in the development of the pathophysiology of ciliopathies
associated with this protein"
10816498,"Many studies implicate mitochondrial dysfunction as a key contributor to age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Previously published gene expression analyses from laser-captured dopaminergic (DA) neurons from the substantia nigra of preclinical patients found a decrease in genes associated with mitochondrial respiration. However, the implications of this decrease in mitochondrial genes and its link to disease progression and pathology are still unknown. A decrease in a large number of nuclearly-encoded mitochondrial genes suggests that a central regulator of gene expression is impaired; in fact, most affected genes are putative targets for the transcription factor estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRg), a transcription factor that has not been well-characterized in neurons. Here, we determine the dependence of DA neurons on ERRg for gene expression, survival, and regulation of motor function and explore whether cell type-specific deletion of ERRg predisposes DA neurons to alpha-synuclein-mediated neurotoxicity. Preliminary experiments determined that removal of ERRg from DA neurons influenced gene expression and motor function and rendered DA neuron processes more vulnerable to loss with alpha-synuclein pre-formed fibril (PFF) exposure. This led to the hypothesis that ERRg has a role in promoting synaptic viability in the presence of alpha-synuclein. Experiments in the predoctoral portion will use bioinformatics, transcriptional assays and novel, cell type-specific proteomic techniques to reveal the ERRg-dependent pathways by which nigral neurons regulate mitochondrial and synaptic function and whether these pathways can be leveraged to prevent or delay disease-related synaptic loss.  Synaptic abnormalities also occur in the cortical-hippocampal circuit with age, contributing to cognitive decline; however, the transcriptional and proteomic changes which contribute to this decline have not been delineated in a cell type-specific way. In the postdoctoral phase of this award, the applicant will apply the technical knowledge acquired during the predoctoral stage to understand the aging circuits in the hippocampus and cortex using bioinformatics and novel cell type-specific proteomic techniques. This work has the potential to reveal how synapses change with age, with the long-term goal of developing strategies to counteract cognitive decline.  In addition to a rigorously designed and innovative research strategy, this application involves a strong training plan specifically designed to promote the future success of the applicant as an independent research scientist in neuroscience and aging. The plan includes exposure to emerging themes and techniques in aging research, opportunities for development in presentation skills and manuscript preparation, co-sponsorship from principal investigators with strong training records and commitment to graduate training, a unique combination of academic and drug discovery expertise, and training in the responsible conduct of research. Altogether, the combined research and training plans position the trainee to become an independent and productive member of the neuroscience aging research community."
10812033,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Neuroscience is one of the fastest growing areas of biomedical research, with many unanswered questions
about the basic mechanisms of brain function and how dysfunction at the genetic, cellular, and systemic levels
leads to neurological diseases and disorders. All of these areas of research are increasingly incorporating
cutting-edge computational research techniques, thus competitive neuroscience research training programs
must teach these skills for a successful research career. Women and historically underrepresented groups
(HUGs) are less common in computational fields, and we will fail to achieve our full potential for neuroscience
research if we cannot remove the barriers that disproportionately impact individuals from HUGs. Our goal is to
provide world-class hands-on training in computational brain science and career building skills to undergraduate
students from HUGs. We aim to increase the readiness and competitiveness of trainees as they prepare for
careers in the biomedical research workforce. We designed a nine-week summer training program to enhance
the research career trajectories of HUG undergraduates through a coordinated set of elements focused on
neuroscience research, building computational fluency, and professional skills development. We will recruit
participants through The Leadership Alliance (TLA), an organization devoted to developing underrepresented
students into outstanding leaders and role models. Through TLA’s Summer Research Program, undergraduates
gain research experience and mentoring in the principles underlying the conduct of research to prepare them to
pursue competitive applications to PhD or MD-PhD programs.
 The Aims of our program are: 1) Engagement in individualized research projects in an interdisciplinary
research environment; 2) Enhancement of coding and computational research skills; 3) Exposure to a breadth
of neuroscience methods and research; and 4) Skills development to prepare for careers in the biomedical
sciences. To accomplish these goals, each participant will join a lab where they will work closely with the faculty
trainer and a near-peer mentor to conduct a research project. We will enhance students' computational fluency
through a short course to establish fundamentals of adopting and using programming languages and interfaces.
To learn about the broad range of neuroscience topics, participants will participate in weekly neuroscience
research techniques series with faculty trainers. They will build professional development skills through
workshops with a graduate student mentor. The summer will culminate in the presentation of a poster featuring
their research project at The Leadership Alliance National Symposium.
 Overall, this R25 program merges individual lab experience in computational neuroscience with
structured research skill building and professional development programming. Participants will build
computational research skills that will serve them well in their future research endeavors."
10933527,"PROJECT SUMMARY
MRI and histopathology are two key methods for all research into age-related cognitive impairment and dementia and they have brought key insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic implications. A major challenge is to characterize the integrative properties of these two modalities, which differ in resolution, coverage, and markers; furthermore, in vivo, vascular abnormalities by nature are difficult to be characterized on post-mortem exams. Post-mortem MRI has emerged as a technique to bridge the gap but necessary techniques are still not fully developed. In this proposal, we propose to develop novel post-mortem MR imaging protocols and computational tools to enable the collection of multi-modal multi-scale brain MR/histopathology/ proteomics data analysis to advance our understanding of gray and white matter neurodegeneration associated with vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). We have assembled a multi-disciplinary research team with leading experts in several key aspects of the proposed study to achieve the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a robust, state-of-the-art post-mortem pipeline for human brain autopsy, fixation, and blocking/sectioning that meet the need for combined MRI/histopathology full-scale analysis of AD/ADRD. These include (a) characterization of the effects of post-mortem interval (PMI) and formalin fixation (i.e., hours to weeks) for modeling such effect in both spatial and temporal domains; and (b) establishing standardized ex vivo MRI procedures that focus on streamlining fixation and sectioning protocols to minimize imaging and tissue deformation/degradation, enabling dependable co-registration between imaging procedures and ensuring precise top-down correlation with histopathology and proteomic analysis. Aim 2: Develop a multi-modality atlas and database of the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) pathology based on co-registered multimodal and multiscale MRI and neuropathology data from a well-characterized cohort at NYU Langone Health ADRC that includes AD, TBI-related and other ADRD vs control subjects, focusing on Aβ, Tau, vascular, and microstructural pathology. The multi-modality vascular and microstructural atlases will be reconstructed and integrated with vascular pathology staining. Aim 3: Study white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) by performing high-fidelity and multi-contrast voxel-wise mapping of post-mortem MRI and histopathology that enable a better understanding of in vivo and ex vivo findings of small vessel disease (SVD). This aim tackles two major obstacles in the research of SVD associated with VCID: cross-modality interpretation and heterogeneity of WMHs. Aim 4: Develop digital libraries for imaging and pathology protocols, software tools, and brain atlases, as well as relevant pre- and post-mortem MRI and biomaterial data to be shared in the research community. Collectively, this project will make contributions to develop standardized and accessible MRI- histology protocols, novel post-mortem and co-registration tools, as well as resources of all imaging and biomaterial data from 75 elderly brains to advance the study of VCID pathology in AD/ADRD."
10812035,"Sepsis represents a life-threatening disorder caused by a dysregulated host response. Sepsis survivors
frequently have long-term immune dysfunction that contributes to high mortality from opportunistic infections.
Clinical data shows that lactate levels strongly and positively correlate with severity, morbidity and mortality
in sepsis5-8. It is unclear whether lactate contributes to sepsis impaired immune response and susceptibility
to subsequent infection.
 To address this important question, we performed preliminary studies and observed that enhanced
lactate levels markedly increased mortality. We also observed that lactate suppresses macrophage
phagocytic function during sepsis. Our findings suggest that lactate exerts a previously unknown biological
function contributing to the mortality of sepsis and re-infection of sepsis survivors.
 Cellular senescence is a fundamental mechanism of age-related organ dysfunction. Our RNA-seq and
other preliminary data shows that lactate markedly induces macrophage senescence during sepsis. our
preliminary data also shows that splenic macrophage senescence is significantly greater in macrophage
specific YAP/TAZ deficient (mYAP/TAZ-/-) sham and septic mice than in WT controls. Our finding suggests
that YAP is required for the protection against cellular senescence during sepsis. Interestingly, we found that
lactate induces lactylation of YAP. We reported that lactate induces HMGB1 lactylation in macrophages25,
suggesting that lactate could induce lactylation of non-histone proteins. Indeed, we made a novel observation
in our preliminary studies that lactate induces Keap1 lactylation and increases Nrf2 activation. Keap1 is an
important suppressor for activation of Nrf2 to upregulate the expression of genes related to suppressive
Immune responses. Our findings indicate that lactate alters macrophage immune response during sepsis that
may be mediated by promoting macrophage senescence and inducing lactylation of important transcription
factors and co-effectors. Based on our novel findings, we hypothesize that lactate is a novel endogenous
mediator which contributes to impaired macrophage immune function during sepsis via lactylation of
transcription factors and effectors and promotion of cellular senescence. To critically evaluate this
hypothesis, we propose three specific aims. Specific aim 1. Investigate the role of lactylation of YAP/TAZ in
macrophage immune dysfunction during sepsis. Specific aim 2. Define the role of Keap1 lactylation and Nrf2
activation in macrophage immune dysfunction during sepsis. Specific aim 3. Investigate whether lactate
promoted senescence of macrophages will contribute to impaired macrophage immune function during
sepsis. Successful completion of the proposed studies will result in a wealth of new and novel data showing
that lactate plays an important role in the regulation of immune responses during sepsis."

10801373,"Precision oncology aims to identify specific characteristics of a tumor, for example pathological or genomic
features, that allow selection of a treatment most likely to achieve success in a patient. While a large number of
single genomic alterations have been identified by large scale exome sequencing efforts, the National Cancer
Institute MATCH trial has revealed that targeting single pathologic exonic alterations achieve clinical benefit in
a minority of cancer patients. For example, lung cancer has the most molecularly directed targets; however,
work from multiple studies, including those conducted by the VA National Precision Oncology Program (NPOP)
has shown that therapeutic targets are identified in <30% of cases. Furthermore, therapeutic target rates are
lower in Veteran lung cancer compared to public data repositories like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
Therefore, there is a critically urgent need to develop new tumor biomarkers for precision oncology.
One reason for the limited success of current precision oncology approaches is current clinical sequencing
tests focus mostly on point alterations (ie. BRAF, EGFR, BRCA1/2), which do not reflect the phenotypic
consequences of the mutational processes that initially caused the tumor. Mutational processes that
underlie human cancer leave mutational signatures in the genome that can be identified by whole
genome sequencing (WGS). Seminal work by the Sanger Institute has identified mutational patterns
indicative of defects in DNA replication and repair, mutagen exposures, and enzymatic modification of DNA.
Currently, 79 single base substitution, 11 doublet base substitution, and 18 insertion/deletion signatures have
been identified that reflect these mutational processes. In addition, patterns of copy number variants can
identify tumor genomes that have undergone doubling events, chromothripsis, kategsis, loss of heterozygosity,
and homologous recombination based DNA repair deficiency. The major published catalogs of tumor
mutational signatures include cancers predominantly from individuals of English descent from efforts in the
United Kingdom. Whether the same mutational signatures are at work in tumors from Veterans, and those
from diverse genetic ancestries, is currently unknown.
We hypothesize that mutational signatures will identify carcinogenic mechanisms resulting from
Veterans’ service-related environmental exposures, provide clinical utility in defining treatment for
Veteran cancer, and will inform further preventative measures to limit cancer-causing exposures. In
order to test this hypothesis, we propose two independent Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will perform
whole genome sequencing (WGS) on Veteran tumors and extract known and novel mutational signatures,
comparing the Veteran signatures to public data. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the clinical utility of
mutational signatures. Our enterprise-wide team will leverage the resources of the National Precision Oncology
Program (Kelley), the Million Veterans Program (Pyarajan) and VA cancer genomics expertise
(Maxwell/Kratz/Neff/Pritchard) to perform and analyze WGS from existing tumor DNA specimens housed within
NPOP. We will determine whether mutational signatures are superior biomarkers in predicting response to
therapy (Fojo) by coupling with disease-specific experts in genitourinary (Garraway/Montgomery/Rettig),
gastrointestinal (Kratz) and lung (Herman/Kelley/Klein) cancers.
At a fundamental level, whether the mutational signatures identified in civilian tumors are found in tumors from
Veterans and whether novel signatures might develop due to war-time exposures is unknown. Identification of
novel mutational signatures may therefore inform preventative measures. Leveraging the diverse Veteran
population, our findings will also greatly expand the knowledge of mutational processes in non-White
individuals. Finally, we will define pathways for novel target development to treat Veterans with cancer and
determine whether mutational signatures should be included in the Precision Oncology care of Veterans."
10805411,"Project Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, represents an acute and ongoing threat to human life. A detailed molecular understanding of the viral life cycle is necessary to illuminate clinically accessible processes that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. The Nucleocapsid (N) protein is a 420-residue multidomain protein with both folded and disordered regions that underlies genome packaging, an essential step in the virion lifecycle. N protein mediates cytosolic genome packaging by binding to and compacting genomic RNA in a process apparently conserved across the coronaviridae family. Our ability to disrupt genome packaging is limited by the absence of a molecular understanding of these processes. To address this knowledge gap, our proposal is focused on the molecular biophysics that underlies how N protein drives genome compaction. N protein is highly multivalent; it can simultaneously bind to both itself and RNA via a number of distinct interaction sites. Multivalency is encoded across both folded domains and intrinsically disordered regions. While there has been substantial work on the folded domains in other coronaviruses, the molecular biophysics of the disordered regions has been largely ignored. We hypothesize N protein multivalency underlies the molecular basis of RNA compaction, and that the three disordered regions play key roles in determining multivalency, binding affinity, and RNA binding specificity. Through the combination of single-molecule fluorescence and force spectroscopy, ensemble methods, and all-atom simulation, we will dissect the molecular details that underlie these interactions. We also present a novel approach to small-molecule screening that leverages the formation of phase separated protein:RNA liquid droplets as a readout for genome compaction. Our work will offer high-resolution structural insight into the physical basis for two critical steps in the viral life cycle, as well as reveal small molecules that can attenuate genome compaction. More generally, by focusing on fundamental biophysical phenomena that empirically explain behavior from other distant coronaviruses, we believe that our conclusions will be broadly transferable to existing coronaviruses that represent major public health threats (e.g., SARS, MERS) but also to future novel zoonotic coronaviruses."

Medical marijuana is legal in 37 states and the District of Columbia, and use among adults 50 and older has
more than doubled in the past decade, with exponential increases projected by 2050. Adults 50 and older are
among the largest consumers of medical marijuana, with chronic pain as their most frequently endorsed reason
for use. In addition, the use of prescription opioids, one of the most common treatments for pain management in
this population, is a factor complicating chronic pain management as those 50 and older are three times more
likely to be prescribed opioids than younger adults. The primary goal of the current proposal is to identify the
effects of daily long-term (i.e., use >12 months daily or most days of the week) medical marijuana use on driving
performance outcomes using an open road test under real world conditions in adults 50 and older who endorse
chronic or severe non-malignant pain; and examine the combined effect of daily long-term medical marijuana
use and prescription opioid use on driving outcomes. A secondary goal is to qualitatively explore self-regulation
of medical marijuana and prescription opioid use in this population. These goals are of the utmost significance
given that THC is associated with a 50% increased risk for traffic crash, and the risk of motor vehicle collision
while driving under the influence of marijuana is two times higher than when driving unimpaired. Further, opioid
use is associated with a 47% increased risk of crash initiation and aging itself is associated with increased crash
risk and declines in driving performance. Thus, the proposed study will test medical marijuana use as the
exposure variable in adults age 50 and older and an open-road driving task performance as the primary outcome.
The study will detail THC exposure through electronic medical records, urinalysis, and data extracted from RYAH
Smart Inhaler devices, in conjunction with measures of open-road driving task. Further, we will use a race-sex
matched group of non-marijuana users, and age variability will be balanced in both groups. Results will provide
evidence for the effects of medical marijuana use and opioid positivity on a real-world driving task among adults
50 and older. To accomplish this, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Identify the effects of daily long-term
medical marijuana use on driving performance using an open-road driving task in adults 50 and older. Aim 2:
Examine the combined effect of medical marijuana use and prescribed opioid use on driving outcomes via an
open road driving performance task. Exploratory Aim: Identify intervention targets to improve self-regulation of
medical marijuana use, prescribed opioid use, and driving performance in adults 50 and older. Given the
proliferation of medical marijuana use and prescription opioid use in adults 50 and older, it is imperative that we
understand the long-term effects of daily medical marijuana use and how co-occurring use with prescription
opioids affects real-world driving outcomes. With our interdisciplinary team’s expertise and our current research
infrastructure throughout the state of Florida, including our research partners, we are uniquely poised to execute
this relevant and timely work."
10800955,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent among veterans and is a substantial public health burden.
Several psychotherapies, including cognitive processing therapy (CPT), have a strong evidence base for their
efficacy in PTSD. However, many individuals show limited benefit from such treatments, particularly older
Veterans. One factor likely affecting treatment response is poor encoding, storage, and retrieval of the skills
and treatment points that are learned in psychotherapy. Individuals with PTSD display deficits in learning and
memory, and aging is independently associated with declines in memory and executive functioning. Thus,
older adults with PTSD may be at heightened risk of cognitive dysfunction that could impact their ability to
benefit from frontline PTSD treatments. To this end, pre-treatment memory functioning has been shown to
consistently predict treatment response in psychotherapy for PTSD. Inefficient learning and memory for
psychotherapy content may be one mechanism explaining this relationship, as poor learning of therapy content
is linked with worse treatment adherence and outcomes. The primary aim of this proposal is to examine the
feasibility and acceptability of integrating a novel Memory Support intervention into the provision of CPT for
older adults with PTSD. The Memory Support intervention was developed such that specific strategies to
enhance encoding and retrieval of therapy content and skills can be integrated into manualized psychotherapy.
However, no prior studies have integrated this intervention into treatments for PTSD. The proposed project will
be guided by a user-centered design framework for treatment development and be conducted in three phases.
In the first phase, we will develop a modified CPT treatment manual that systematically integrates Memory
Support, with clinician (n=3) and Veteran (n=3) feedback to provide guidance on process and techniques. In
the next phase, we will conduct iterative refinement of the modified treatment through a case series in older
Veterans (n=3) with an experienced CPT therapist. Finally, we will conduct a small feasibility randomized
controlled trial (n=20) in which we will examine accrual, retention, completion, acceptability, and variability in
symptom and functional outcomes, as well as all procedures for a larger trial. The proposed project offers
substantial conceptual innovations by bridging foundational work from rehabilitation neuropsychology and
psychotherapy mechanisms research and will provide valuable pilot data to inform a novel intervention for
older Veterans with PTSD that can be tested in future large-scale studies. Such approaches may be especially
relevant for Veterans with neurocognitive deficits (e.g., memory), potentially suggesting a target for a
personalized approach to mental health care."

Alterations of the mycobiome composition that have been associated with Crohn’s disease (CD) are challenging
to link to defining elements of pathophysiology of this disease such as poor injury repair. Our published work
shows that using culture dependent and independent methods, Debaryomyces hansenii, a yeast best known for
its role as an additive in the food industry, is the dominant microbe found to non-healed intestinal wounds of
subjects with CD in two different medical centers. D. hansenii was not found in adjacent healthy tissue. D.
hansenii strains cultured from inflamed CD mucosal tissue impaired colonic healing when introduced into injured
conventionally raised or gnotobiotic mice. D. hansenii was re-isolated from injured areas of these mice, fulfilling
Koch’s postulates using animal models. Mechanistically, D. hansenii impaired mucosal healing via macrophage
production of type 1 Interferon (IFN) (not traditional proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF) that in turn led to
overproduction of the chemokine CCL5 a driver of poor repair. We have new preliminary data that shows D.
hansenii spores and vegetative cells are both important to the overall pathology of poor wound repair in the
intestine. We hypothesize that in damaged intestines, D. hansenii spores are taken up by F4/80+ innate immune
cells in the wound bed without eliciting a TNF response thereby allowing for persistence within the macrophage.
We also hypothesize that these D. hansenii spores germinate into vegetative cells within these macrophages.
This process stimulates type I IFN production through TLR3 engagement and this immune response prevents
wound healing. Our goals are to determine how D. hansenii spores evade macrophage killing (Aim 1) and how
germinating/vegetative cells can stimulate type I IFN (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will also develop tools for the detection
of D. hansenii spores and vegetative cells in murine models of injury and we will use these tools to determine in
preclinical models to determine if antifungal therapy can effectively eradicate cells in different morphologies with
the goal of restoring wound healing. Our studies will provide tools new knowledge to understand why D. hansenii
behaves as a pathogen in CD, and we will use this information to develop concepts for new diagnostics and
therapies for CD patients."

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle that houses factors that assist proteins in their folding and
supports the formation of stabilizing covalent modifications. Perturbation of ER functions results in
evolutionarily conserved cell stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR). Recent studies have indicated the
critical role of ER stress in diabetes-induced cardiac cell death. However, a pathway connecting hyperglycemia
to downstream events of UPR has remained elusive. Here, we present preliminary data demonstrating that
Arrestin Domain-Containing protein 4 (Arrdc4) is a glucose-responsive protein that mediates ER stress and
cardiac dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. Arrdc4 is a member of the ancient family of arrestin-fold proteins with
conserved roles in regulating nutrient transporter trafficking as adaptor proteins. We have found that Arrdc4
expression is robustly upregulated by high glucose in cardiomyocytes. Arrdc4 binds to the basal glucose
transporter 1 (GLUT1), induces its endocytosis, and blocks cellular glucose uptake. Arrdc4-mediated glucose
deprivation leads to the activation of UPR in cardiomyocytes, revealing a unique function of Arrdc4 in
cardiomyocyte metabolism and survival. To define the in vivo function of Arrdc4, we generated and
characterized a systemic Arrdc4-knockout (KO) mouse model. In this animal model, Arrdc4-KO mice have
fasting hypoglycemia, and Arrdc4-KO hearts exhibit a robust increase in myocardial glucose uptake without
insulin stimulation. Furthermore, deletion of Arrdc4 reduces ER stress during the development of diabetic
cardiomyopathy and protects the heart against cardiomyocyte apoptosis in type 1 diabetes. These results
define the outlines of an Arrdc4-GLUT1-UPR pathway that provides a strong link between hyperglycemia and
cardiomyocyte survival. This project aims to delineate the molecular nature of this pathway and tests its role in
the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Aim 1 will test three non-exclusive hypotheses by which high
glucose induces ER stress: (a) Arrdc4 is a target of the glucose-sensing transcriptional mechanism, (b) Arrdc4
sensitizes cardiomyocytes to ER stress by energy insufficiency through GLUT1 inhibition, and (c) Arrdc4 may
even promote ER stress through a mechanism beyond GLUT1 interaction. Aim 2a will characterize the cardiac
metabolic phenotype in the type 2 diabetic model to determine whether Arrdc4-KO mouse hearts are protected
from proteotoxic apoptosis. Moreover, Aim 2b will test the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of Arrdc4
deficiency in diabetes is cardiac autonomous or secondary to the glycemic control by skeletal muscle using our
newly-generated inducible, tissue-specific Arrdc4-KO mice, focusing on the significance of Arrdc4 in exercise
intolerance, an independent predictor of poor prognosis in diabetes. These studies are highly innovative as we
propose a pathway that has never been entertained as a cardiac stress regulator in diabetes. The resulting
knowledge will provide a new mechanistic basis for understanding the defense mechanism to protect
cardiomyocytes against diabetic insults. Based on the novelty of the study, this application is highly significant."
10803939,"Project Summary
The overall goal of this project is to develop new statistical methods that address important problems in ge-
nomics, to implement them in user-friendly open source software, and to make them available to scientists to
facilitate new biological discoveries. To this end, the proposed work tackles three important problems arising in
genomics where existing statistical methods are lacking, and where new, improved methods could accelerate the
pace of scientific discovery: fine-mapping of functional traits; gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA); and discovering
overlapping cluster structure in genomic data.
 The work on fine-mapping will enable the identification of genetic variants influencing common sequencing
assays such as ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq, without pre-specifying the locations of potential effects. This unbiased
approach will help identify regulatory genetic variants and interacting parts of the regulatory genome.
 The work on GSEA will provide a new more effective set of tools for researchers who use GSEA to set new
findings in the context of known biology. The proposed work uses recently-developed statistical techniques
to substantially reduce the redundancy of enriched gene sets, and will provide researchers with succinct and
precise results that better highlight the full range of known biological factors that are relevant to a new set of
findings.
 The work on overlapping cluster structure will provide new generally-applicable methods for understanding
complex layered and hierarchical relationships that occur commonly in genomics applications (e.g. cell sub-
types nested within cell types, layered on top of patient effects).
 The tools developed here will help scientists tackle a diverse range of analysis problems that arise in ge-
nomics, ultimately helping them better understand the biology of disease, with the eventual goal of improving
therapies and treatment strategies."

This R01 proposal responds to “Notice of Special Interest in Research on the Health of Sexual and Gender
Minority (SGM) Populations” (NOT-MD-19-001) which calls for research describing “clinical, behavioral, and
social processes affecting the health of SGM individuals and their families” that will promote development of
appropriate interventions to improve SGM health and fertility care. This proposal includes clinical studies of
transgender individuals and the effects of androgen treatment on their reproductive health. Androgens can have
significant inhibitory effects on neuroendocrine reproductive hormone secretion in both sexes, yet the
mechanisms and cell types by which androgens suppress GnRH and LH pulsatile and surge secretion in females
are poorly studied and remain unknown. Indeed, high levels of exogenous androgens fundamentally contribute
to reproductive disruption seen in otherwise healthy women and transgender men (female sex individuals taking
high levels of androgens), but the mechanisms, time course, and target neuroendocrine site(s) of action for these
inhibitory androgen effects are poorly understood. Our overall hypothesis is that male levels of exogenous
androgens can inhibit the female reproductive neuroendocrine axis by acting through androgen receptor (AR) in
hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons to modulate endogenous LH pulse secretion and impede generation of the
estrogen-generated preovulatory LH surge. We test this hypothesis in two complementary Aims that study the
role of high exogenous androgens in both a clinical setting in transgender male (female sex) human subjects
and corresponding transgenic female mouse models. Aim 1 investigates the effects of exogenous androgens in
a clinical setting, studying transgender men taking gender affirming testosterone therapy. This clinical Aim
assess the inhibitory effects and time-course of androgen treatment on a wide suite of reproductive
neuroendocrine parameters, with a focus on in vivo LH pulse and LH surge secretion, coupled with analyses of
menstrual cyclicity and ovarian measures. Aim 2 utilizes transgenic mice to test whether male-level androgens
acting via AR specifically in kisspeptin neurons are necessary and/or sufficient for androgen inhibition of in vivo
LH pulse parameters, including pulse frequency, and the estrogen-induced LH surge. This Aim also elucidates
whether elevated androgen action directly in kisspeptin cells is necessary for AR inhibition of reproductive gene
expression in the female brain, and uses innovative methodology to analyze androgen-induced changes in the
transcriptome of specific kisspeptin neural populations in females, identifying how exogenous androgens impact
these neurons to impede LH secretion. Together, these two complementary Aims will elucidate the cellular,
molecular, and physiological mechanisms of androgen inhibition on female neuroendocrine reproductive
hormones. This project will advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of androgen action in
neuroendocrine control of reproduction and inform upon future clinical interventions for rescuing reproductive
function in females or currently understudied SGM transgender males exposed to exogenous androgens."
10934380,"Filipino youth living in the United States (US) have significant behavioral health problems, including alarmingly
high rates of adolescent depression, anxiety, substance use, and suicidal behavior. Suboptimal parent-child
relationships and harsh discipline are critical risk factors for behavioral health problems among youth. Filipino
families also face acculturative challenges, parental separation due to immigration, family conflict, parental
mental health disorders, and maltreatment. Few, if any prevention programs are available to Filipinos despite
their rapid population growth in the US. The Incredible Years® School Age Parent Training Program (IY) is an
evidence-based preventive intervention designed to improve parenting skills and parent-child relationships
among families with school age youth. As a result of pilot studies funded through a K23 grant from NICHD, a
KL2 grant from NCATS, we have demonstrated IY efficacy in improving positive parenting practices and child
depression and anxiety symptoms in Filipino families. We have improved the intervention protocol for use
online with older children and secured agreements from community agencies to participate in the project.
Further research is needed on the effectiveness of online IY, and the impact of engagement (i.e., attendance)
on intervention outcomes as well as the barriers and facilitators to implementation by providers in community
agencies. Building upon ongoing collaborative research and community awareness-raising within Filipino
communities in California, we propose a Type 1 hybrid, individually group randomized treatment trial to
compare IY with a usual care control group who will receive IY after 3 months. Specifically, the study seeks to
recruit a sample of 250 Filipino parents and children ages 8-12 years through community organizations in
California. Participants in both groups will be followed for a minimum of 6 months with assessments that
include parent-report and child-report. Our primary objective is to test the effectiveness of online IY on our
primary outcomes: parent-reported parenting practices (positive verbal discipline), child-reported child
depression and anxiety symptoms, and secondary outcomes: parent-reported physical punishment, parent-
reported child internalizing behavior, parent-reported child depression & anxiety symptoms, and parent- and
child-reported youth resilience. Our specific aims are: 1) To test the effectiveness of the online Incredible
Years® model of parent training and its impact on primary and secondary outcomes; 2) To determine
the impact of engagement (i.e., IY attendance) on primary outcomes; and 3) To describe intervention
delivery and its online implementation in real-world community settings. We will utilize quantitative and
qualitative research methodologies to advance the scientific understanding of parenting interventions during
middle childhood. If the approach and intervention format succeed with Filipinos, comparable strategies could
be used effectively reach other immigrant or minority populations, many of whom are reluctant to seek
preventive parenting programs."
10804223,"Project Abstract
 Bacterial infections and chronic diseases cause significant healthcare costs each year. However, the
mechanisms underlying the formation of bacterial communities, such as biofilms and swarming colonies, remain
poorly understood. Community formation by motile bacteria is typically initiated when a cell senses its attachment
to a surface, usually by utilizing the flagellum as a tactile (mechanosensor) sensor. The flagellar stator, which
rotates the flagellum, has been shown to sense mechanical obstruction upon adhesion to a surface and remodel
in response. The remodeled stator delivers higher mechanical force to rotate the flagellar rotor. While the stator
has been widely implicated in surface sensing and biochemical signaling, the mechanisms are not understood.
Understanding these mechanisms is critical for developing innovative strategies to prevent bacterial community
formation. The PI's preliminary findings have uncovered a link between chemotaxis signaling and stator
mechanosensing. Therefore, the objective of the proposed work is to explain the mechanistic basis for this link
and reveal fundamental insights into mechanotransduction in bacteria. The long-term goal is to develop clinically
useful strategies to prevent chronic bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance. The proposed projects will
quantitatively measure the mechanical stimuli on the flagella as the cell's extracellular environment changes.
Investigations will determine the correlation between mechanical stimuli and the stator's role in maintaining
homeostasis in the output of the chemotaxis signaling network, which enables the cell to transition to surface-
adapted lifestyles. The mechanism by which the stator amplifies force delivered to the rotor to adapt the
chemotactic output will be determined to explain the basis for its mechanosensitive functions. Finally, the
mechanism by which the cell globally couples mechanosensitive flagellar functions will be explained. The
proposed work will employ advanced biophysical techniques such as optical tweezers, single-motor mechanical
stimulation assays, single-molecule fluorescence measurements, molecular biology tools, and stochastic
modeling. It is expected that the results will help establish a paradigm for understanding how bacteria integrate
signals from mechanosensors to target suitable niches. Quantification of the extracellular mechanical stimuli
typically encountered by the cells is anticipated to assist researchers in interpreting motility results across diverse
bacterial species."
10803632,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Fungal infections caused by dimorphic fungi Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides
posadasii are endemic to the southwestern parts of the United States and the selected areas in the Western
Hemisphere. While most infections are mild and, symptomatic pneumonia can be extremely difficult to treat and
requires lifelong azole therapy underscoring the need for new therapeutic options. In this respect, targeting the
high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and, specifically, hybrid
histidine kinases (HHKs), represents a promising approach because HHKs are not present in humans but are
critical components of cellular responses to oxidative stress in pathogenic fungi. We have identified a natural
product candidate that shows potent fungicidal activity against Coccidioides in a murine model. The overarching
goal of this collaborative project is to optimize antifungal activity of synthetic analogs as a potential lead for valley
fever treatment. In Aim 1, we will perform rational SAR study on a lead candidate by introducing modifications in
three distinct parts of the molecule. In Aim 2, we will study the mechanism of action of the lead candidates and
fine-tune in silico model to guide rational analog preparation. In Aim 3, we will perform PK/PD studies and validate
the activity of the optimized candidate in a murine model of coccidioidomycosis. Collectively, this study will result
in a small molecule fungicide with optimized properties for future pre-clinical work."

At chemical synapses, the presynaptic action potential triggers vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release.
Although action potential-driven high Ca2+ elevation is required to rapidly trigger exocytosis, the resting level of
Ca2+ can modulate release probability via vesicle recruitment, priming and sensitization. Moreover, subthreshold
depolarizations can spread from the dendrites and soma into the axon terminals and depolarizations of
presynaptic resting membrane potential largely increase the probability of neurotransmitter release and the
strength of neurotransmission. Thus, synaptic transmission relies on a hybrid between analog changes in resting
membrane potential and digital action potential signaling, called Analog-Digital synaptic transmission. The
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that mediate action potential-triggered neurotransmitter release have been
extensively studied in various neurons. However, the ion channels that determine the resting Ca2+ level and
mediate depolarization-induced elevation of terminal Ca2+ are largely unknown. Reasons for this gap in our
understanding include the small size of conventional synapses, extremely small Ca2+ conductances at resting
and subthreshold membrane potentials, and lack of specific pharmacological tools to dissect each conductance.
The mouse calyx of Held is a giant glutamatergic synapse in the auditory brainstem that permits direct pre- and
post-synaptic recordings, allowing us to directly study presynaptic Ca2+-permeable ion channels. In this renewal
application, we extend our previous studies on presynaptic Na+ control of vesicle recycling and loading to
characterize the Ca2+-permeable ion channels that control resting Ca2+ level and mediate depolarization-induced
Ca2+ elevations, and to study how hearing loss affects the channel function and synaptic transmission. This work
will establish a new fundamental role of resting and subthreshold Ca2+ to link activity and synaptic function under
physiological and pathological conditions."

The long-term goals of this proposal are two-fold: (i) understand the functional role of G0/G1 switch gene 2
(G0S2) during normal and obese hematopoiesis, and (ii) leverage that understanding for the development of
new therapeutics to treat multiple obesity-related conditions. The prevalence of obesity in the United States has
tripled over the past several decades, which has tremendous effects on overall health. Chronic inflammation,
due to the overproduction of myeloid cells from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of the bone marrow, is an
established mechanism explaining the negative health impacts of obesity. Hematopoiesis is the process of blood
cell production by HSCs residing in the bone marrow. Energy metabolism has emerged as an important regulator
of HSC fate. Lipid metabolism, primarily fatty acid oxidation (FAO), was shown to aid in HSC self-renewal and
differentiation. One important regulator of lipid metabolism is G0S2, a small 11 kDa protein that regulates multiple
cellular functions, including intracellular lipolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. G0S2 contributes to triglyceride
accumulation both indirectly through inhibition of lipolysis in adipose and liver tissue, and also directly through
lysophosphatidic acyl transferase (LPAAT) enzymatic activity. However, while much is known about the role of
G0S2 in highly metabolic cells, its role in normal blood cell development is unknown. We hypothesize that G0S2
LPAAT activity regulates lipid and energy during normal myeloid development. Specific Aim 1: Test the
hypothesis that G0S2 regulates neutrophil development and function in normal but not obese mice.
Utilizing mice maintained on a normal- versus high-fat-diet, we will assess the effects of altered G0S2 expression
on the differentiation of murine HSCs in response to granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) both ex vivo
and in vivo. We will utilize wild-type versus G0S2 knockout mice, and will test for differences comparing male
versus female mice. Specific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that G0S2 LPAAT activity contributes to myeloid
development. We will investigate whether G0S2 LPAAT activity contributes to survival or differentiation of
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We will utilize bone marrow from G0S2 knockout mice for ectopic
expression of wild-type versus mutant forms of murine G0S2. Resulting cells will be assessed for phenotypic
changes both ex vivo and in vivo. We have formed a collaborative research team to rigorously establish the
mechanistic role of G0S2 during myeloid development. Additionally, this R15 project will provide a unique training
opportunity for graduate students in our MSc program. Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at El Paso
is a Title V Hispanic-Serving Institution located along the U.S./Mexico border, with a majority of our population
identifying as Hispanic. This R15 will enhance the ability of our students to prepare for future jobs as research
assistants, and will help them compete successfully for admission into MD and/or PhD education programs.
Successful completion of the proposed experiments will be crucial for understanding the role of G0S2 and lipid
metabolism during normal blood cell development, and will promote the careers of young minority students."

 New strategies to prevent breast cancer are urgently needed because: i) breast cancer incidence rates keep
rising by 0.5% per year and about 13%, or 1 in 8, of U.S. women are going to develop invasive breast cancer in
their life time; ii) the endocrine-targeted agents for ER+ breast cancer prevention do not reduce breast cancer
mortality; iii) prevention strategy for ER- breast cancer, which has higher mortality rate, is still not available yet.
 Our recent study (published on Cancer Cell 2022 Jan 10;40(1):36-52) uncovered that high levels of plasma
histamine and histamine receptor H1 (HRH1) expression in tumors (mainly on macrophages) are significantly
correlated with reduced cytotoxic immune cell infiltration and devastating T cell function in patients with breast
cancer. On the contrary, breast cancer patients who took H1-antihistamines during immunotherapy treatment
had evidently improved survival. Importantly, the association between antihistamine uptake and better clinical
outcome was only observed in patients treated with immunotherapies but not that with chemotherapies,
suggesting that H1-antihistamines may contribute to antitumor immunity. Indeed, we found that H1-antihistamine
treatment or HRH1 knockout boosted CD8+ cytotoxic T cell activities and enhanced immunotherapy responses
in several mammary tumor models. More interestingly, our latest retrospective analysis of the electronic health
record of a MDACC patient cohort with stage 0 or 1 breast cancers revealed that patients who took H1-
antihistamines had significantly reduced tumor recurrence compared to patients who did not take them. Patients
who received therapies other than surgery were excluded, suggesting that the reduced recurrence is not due to
enhanced therapeutic response. These new findings led us to hypothesize that blocking histamine-HRH1 axis
by H1-antihstamines enhances immune surveillance and intercepts breast cancer development. We propose
two Specific Aims: 1) Test the effect of H1-antihistamines on intercepting mouse mammary tumor development.
We will test i) whether H1-antihistmaines can intercept early-stage mammary tumors in mouse models that mimic
patients with early stage breast cancers (i.e., the cohort in the analysis); ii) whether H1-antihistamines will
prevent/delay basal-like breast cancer initiation/progression in a genetically engineered mouse model which
recapitulates the natural development of breast cancer; 2) Determine the impact of blocking histamine-HRH1
axis on systemic immune landscape and tumor immune microenvironment in early stage mammary tumors. We
will examine i) broad effects of H1-antihistamine on blood immune cell landscape by CyTOF; ii) impacts of H1-
antihistamines on local immunity, e.g., the spatial interactions of mammary epithelial cells and diverse immune
cell populations. Integrating above data, we will identify key changes of immune cells that are linked with
antihistamine-mediated immunoprevention. The proposed study will explore a new strategy based on our latest
findings to address the unmet challenge for breast cancer prevention. If the results are promising, our findings
could be translated into clinic trials for immunoprevention of breast cancer, especially, in women at high-risk."

One way in which chronic alcohol exposure produces neuronal adaptations is by changing gene expression.
These changes can influence alcohol-drinking behavior and may lead to the development of alcohol use
disorder (AUD). Additionally, during alcohol withdrawal, gene expression changes can contribute to the
development of negative affective states, such as anxiety and depression, which makes it challenging for
individuals to stop consuming alcohol. Mounting evidence from many species indicates that chronic a lcohol
exposure also leads to alternatively spliced transcripts in different brain regions. Yet the molecular
mechanisms by which alcohol alters RNA splicing remains unknown. This K99/R00 award includes a
comprehensive career development and research plan based on Dr. Luana Carvalho’s preliminary data
showing that withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure in male rats increases the expression of genes
encoding components of the RNA splicing machinery and leads to changes in RNA splicing. My preliminary
data shows increased expression of the splicing factor Poly r(C) binding protein (PCBP1) in the hippocampus
(HPC) of ethanol withdrawn rats that present with anxiety and depression-like behavior, as well as in the
postmortem HPC of subjects diagnosed with AUD. I also found that PCBP1 is implicated in the mis-splicing
of the Hapln2 gene, an important regulator of neuronal conductivity in which loss of function could negatively
impact neurotransmission in the context of alcohol use. The scientific goal of this K99/R00 is to investigate
RNA splicing, with a focus on PCBP1, as a mechanism by which chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal
leads to molecular alterations and contributes to the emergence of negative affective states. I will manipulate
PCBP1 expression using viral-mediated gene delivery to test its behavioral relevance during alcohol
withdrawal. I will also perform RNA immunoprecipitation with a PCBP1 antibody, followed by next generation
sequencing to identify PCBP1-targets. Finally, I will perform full-length transcriptome sequencing to identify
the portfolio of alternatively spliced transcripts in the HPC during chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal.
During my K99 phase, I will gain additional technical training in cutting-edge molecular, bioinformatic and
statistical approaches. I will also enhance my leadership skills and receive considerable training in grant
writing, oral presentations, and ethics that will be crucial to my success as an independent researcher.
During the R00 phase, I will apply all training received to continue this project and further explorer PCBP1
targets in the HPC of humans diagnosed with AUD. Collectively, this work will provide insights into the
molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol withdrawal-induced changes on RNA splicing and negative
affective states, reveal novel targets and testable hypothesis for future functional studies, and facilitate
translational research for finding new targets for AUD treatment."

Cancer metabolic reprogramming is key for the adaptation of the tumors to their harsh microenvironments.
Elevated LD abundance in tumors is frequently detected and is being recognized as a common feature of their
rewired metabolism. Lipid droplets are multifaceted organelles that participate in crucial cellular functions
including metabolism, membrane synthesis and homeostasis, signaling, and protein trafficking. We and others
have shown that hypoxia stimulates LD accumulation and that forced depletion of LD stores impedes tumor
growth. In order to discover novel regulators of lipid droplet turnover, we performed a genome-wide loss of
function screen based on Crispr engineering. Edited cells were separated based on their LD abundance and
sequenced. Our approach identified GFPT1 (glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1) as a candidate
positive LD regulator. GFPT1 catalyzes the first and rate limiting step in hexosamine biosynthesis.
The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway uses a glycolytic intermediate and glutamine to produce UDP-GlcNAc
which is essential for O-GlcNACylation and glycosylation of proteins and other macromolecules. Flux through
the hexosamine pathway is regulated by oncogenic events, nutrient availability, and input from nutrient sensors
like AMPK. In turn, HBP impacts crucial signaling functions and metabolic processes. Cancers have elevated
HBP activity and gene expression and are dependent on this activity for survival, growth, and metastatic
dissemination. Broad range pharmacological inhibitors of the HBP have shown promising results as a therapeutic
approach, however, there are no HBP-directed cancer therapies currently approved. Our preliminary finding that
GFPT1 positively regulates lipid storage prompts us to hypothesize that concurrent inhibition of the HBP and
neutral lipid synthesis will result in more complete LD depletion and enhanced tumor control.
In aim 1 we will delineate the lipid metabolic processes impacted by genetic GFPT1 ablation or small molecule
inhibition of HBP in PDAC models in vitro. We will uncover nutritional requirements for LD turnover under
normoxia and hypoxia in the context of HBP inhibition and will quantify the toxicity of combined HBP- and lipid
metabolism inhibition. Further, we will mechanistically link GFPT1 and AMPK via post-translational modifications
during normoxic and hypoxic LD accumulation. In aim 2 we will evaluate the in vivo efficacy of HBP and metabolic
inhibitors in orthotopic PDAC models and will measure the impact of these new treatment schemes on tumor
microenvironmental characteristics. Successful completion of this proposal will uncover a new connection
between two cancer-promoting metabolic programs and will develop new chemotherapeutic paradigms for
cancer treatment."

 Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen that frequently causes genital tract
syndromes including urethritis in men and cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility in women.
Sensitive diagnostic tests have been approved in the US since 2019, however, few treatment options for M.
genitalium are available. M. genitalium lacks a cell wall and has only a single membrane so antibiotics
targeting peptidoglycan synthesis, or the bacterial outer membrane, are completely inactive. Doxycycline is
only 30-40% effective in eradicating M. genitalium infections. The efficacy of azithromycin, the preferred
therapy, has decreased in recent years and now more than 50% of US strains are resistant. In high-risk
populations in the US and worldwide azithromycin resistance reaches 100%. More than 10% of strains are
resistant to moxifloxacin, the recommended second line therapy, and resistance to both macrolides and
fluoroquinolones is increasingly reported. No effective treatment options are approved in the US to treat these
dually resistant infections. In addition, moxifloxacin is not approved for certain patient groups (e.g., pregnant
women, adolescents <18 years old), and the FDA discourages fluoroquinolone use unless no other options
exist because of potentially severe and permanent side effects. There is an urgent and immediate need to
identify additional therapies with activity against M. genitalium. We determined that M. genitalium is susceptible
in vitro to nitroimidazoles, consistent with a recently published clinical trial demonstrating that metronidazole
reduced M. genitalium infection in women with PID, and contrary to the accepted view that these drugs are
inactive against mycoplasmas. Building on our preliminary data we now propose to define the activity of
nitroimidazole and nitrofuran antibiotics against M. genitalium in detail. We will assess the in vitro susceptibility
to more than a dozen nitro group-containing drugs for which clinical safety and efficacy data are known,
including several that are approved for other indications in the US and elsewhere in the world. The in vitro
activity of these drugs will be compared in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration, time kill kinetics, post
antibiotic effect, activity against biofilms, and spontaneous resistance rates to inform future clinical trials.
Differences in strain susceptibility will be determined by measuring the potency of top performing analogs
against our existing collection of clinical isolates. We found that nitroimidazole resistance is associated with
mutations affecting an oxidoreductase gene suggesting a mechanism for the bioreductive activation of the
prodrug that is necessary for its bactericidal activity. We propose to expand and confirm these findings by
isolating additional resistant mutants and defining drug-enzyme interactions with wild type and mutant alleles of
the purified oxidoreductase. This study will have direct translational impact by offering clinicians and their
patients additional options for the untreatable M. genitalium infections that are increasingly reported."

Proper skin restoration after the damage is vital for organismal survival. The lymphatic vascular system is spread
throughout the human body and has a critical function in mammalian physiology. In physiological conditions, its
main function is the regulation of tissue drainage, immunosurveillance, and regeneration. Lymphatic dysfunction
causes lymphedema a medical condition that manifests as tissue swelling and fibrosis. This serious condition
results in profound severe delays in wound repair and the formation of chronic non-healing wounds. The
mechanism by which lymphatic vessels regulate skin repair is unexplored. Additionally, while the role of
lymphatic vessels in immune cell egress from tissues is well-established, how lymphatic vessels may directly
modulate immune function in damaged tissues is poorly-defined. Recently, I discovered that lymphatic vessels
are actively remodeled during wound healing to form small capillaries which are present in close localization to
the wound front and hair follicles. This remodeling is critical for optimal repair as skin-specific loss of lymphatic
vessels results in a significant delay in wound closure accompanied by a massive infiltration of immune cells.
This proposal aims to leverage these observations by 1) delineating the mechanisms and consequences of
lymphatic vessel remodeling during skin repair, and 2) determining the role of lymphatic vessels and fluid
pressure in macrophage behavior during skin repair. This research stands to have a significant clinical impact
because it can serve as a basis for developing new therapeutic avenues for lymphedema ulcers and chronic
wound management. In addition, career-oriented guidance from my mentor and advisors, along with career
development activated during the K99 phase that includes formal coursework on grant writing and project
management, will further facilitate my transition to the R00 phase and my long-term productivity as an
independent academic investigator. Collectively, the proposed research and career development plans are
expected to generate data with a significant impact on understanding the repair and immunomodulatory functions
of lymphatic vessels in skin repair and setting the basis of my future research as an independent researcher."

Copper is an essential trace nutrient critical to human health. As a prominent cofactor in metalloproteins, it is
required to support many fundamental biological functions, including respiration, superoxide detoxification,
degradation of amines, and the mobilization and uptake of iron. Cellular copper levels are tightly controlled
through a complex network of membrane transporters, chaperone proteins, ligands, and transcription factors. If
placed in the wrong environment, copper has the ability to catalyze the production of hydroxyl radicals and
other reactive oxygen species, a common deleterious mechanism that has profound implications in neuro-
degenerative diseases (ALS and Alzheimer’s disease) and diseases associated with copper mistrafficking
(Menkes and Wilson’s disease). As the pathological conditions are often caused by the toxicity of mislocalized
copper rather than the failure to deliver copper to cuproenzymes, detailed knowledge of the copper interactions
within the cellular proteome is of fundamental importance. The goal of this grant application is to develop
molecular tools that will allow researchers to dissect and discover new copper trafficking pathways, both under
normal physiological conditions and their alterations in diseases associated with copper dyshomeostasis. In a
broader context, the proposed tools are expected to be of critical importance for the long-term development of
novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods to combat copper related human diseases."

Central nervous system (CNS) relapse is a major cause of treatment failure among patients with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Notably, isolated CNS relapse occurs in ~3-8% of children with ALL and
accounts for 30–40% of initial relapses in some clinical trials. Furthermore, current CNS-directed therapies are
associated with significant toxicities. As a result, novel CNS-directed leukemia therapies are urgently needed
to improve long-term outcomes while decreasing treatment-related morbidity. Although extensive research has
demonstrated a critical role of the bone marrow microenvironment in leukemia biology, the impact of the CNS
microenvironment on leukemia cell survival and chemoresistance is largely unknown. We developed a novel
ex vivo co-culture system and an in vivo xenotransplantation approach to investigate the effects of the CNS
niche on leukemia biology and chemoresistance. We then used these model systems to identify that 1)
leukemia cells cultured in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in vitro and in vivo have diminished survival relative to
serum or media, 2) leukemia cells predominantly localize to the meninges within the CNS, and 3) leukemia
cells co-cultured with meningeal cells, or associated with the meninges of mice, exhibit enhanced survival and
chemoresistance. We then identified that direct meningeal-leukemia interactions promote leukemia cell survival
by modulating apoptosis balance, cell cycle progression, and quiescence. Importantly, leukemia
chemoresistance was reversible and overcome by detaching the leukemia cells from the meninges. We then
used a co-culture adhesion assay to identify drugs that disrupt the interaction between leukemia and
meningeal cells. In addition to identifying several drugs that inhibit canonical cell adhesion targets and
pathways, including the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, we found that Me6TREN, a novel small-molecule
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilizing compound, also disrupts the interaction between leukemia and
meningeal cells. This work demonstrates that the meninges exert a unique and critical influence on leukemia
chemoresistance and defines novel mechanisms of CNS relapse beyond the well-described role of the blood-
brain barrier. Based on this work, our central hypothesis is that the leukemia-meningeal cell interaction is a
critical regulator of leukemia cell survival and chemoresistance in the CNS. Moreover, from a therapeutic
standpoint, we hypothesize that niche disruption may be more efficacious in the CNS than in the bone marrow
because of the less supportive environment of the CSF relative to the blood or serum. The objectives in this
proposal are to use our in vitro and in vivo model systems for CNS leukemia to dissect the molecular
mechanisms that mediate leukemia adhesion (Aim 1) and chemoresistance (Aim 2) in the CNS and test novel,
clinically translatable therapies for CNS leukemia including Me6TREN and AMD3100 (Aim 3).

Obesity is an ongoing epidemic, with more than two-thirds of adults in the US considered to be overweight or
obese. Treatment options for these patients, including all FDA approved anti-obesity drugs, are ineffective for
long term weight loss. The lack of effective treatments for obesity signals a gap in knowledge. The white adipose
tissue is responsible for maintaining energy storage and release to maintain fuel homeostasis in the body.
Disruption of white adipocyte function due to excess energy intake is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of
obesity, resulting in insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic diseases. Recent advancements in
gene sequencing and mass spectrometry technology have allowed scientists to identify small Open Reading
Frames (smORFs), which encodes functional microproteins that have a wide range of biological roles. The
Saghatelian laboratory has pioneered a suite of multi-omic platforms that integrate proteomics, ribosome profiling
(Ribo-Seq), and RNA sequencing to accurately annotate smORFs of less than 150 codons. By performing Ribo-
Seq on models of murine adipocytes, the applicant has identified 1721 novel smORFs in the mouse genome.
The great majority of these smORFs are uncharacterized. This major goal in this proposal is to address this
knowledge gap by characterizing novel adipocyte smORFs that are involved in adipogenesis (Aim 1) and insulin
signaling (Aim 2). Using a CRISPR/Cas9 library screen specifically targeting the 1721 novel smORFs, the
applicant has already identified ~20 smORFs that specifically inhibit adipogenesis. Subaim 1.1 will validate
these findings through generation of smORF knockout 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to assess how specific smORFs
affect adipocyte differentiation, followed by rescue experiments through overexpressing smORFs in knockout
cells. In Subaim 1.2, the applicant will dive deep into the function of a specific microprotein identified in Subaim
1.1 by characterizing its cellular location and microprotein-protein interaction. In Aim 2, the applicant will exploit
the genomic and physiology data from the Diversity Outbred (DO) mice to identify smORFs that correlates with
physiological changes, such as body weight, blood glucose, and triglycerides. The applicant will determine
whether knocking out the smORFs identified from this analysis in 3T3-L1 cells will affect insulin signaling and
glucose uptake under normal conditions and in in vitro models of insulin resistance. Completion of these studies
will reveal how smORF and microproteins regulate adipocyte differentiation and insulin signaling."

Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) describes a group of disorders in which the alveolar space is progressively replaced by
fibrotic tissue which eventually leads to death from respiratory failure. Available therapies modestly slow disease
progression but are not curative, difficult to tolerate and most patients die unless they receive a lung transplant.
The prevalence of PF has tripled in the US Veterans Population between 2010 and 2019 and likely to continue
increasing in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We were the first to show that some patients with severe COVID-
19 develop severe lung fibrosis that is indistinguishable from IPF even at the level of the single cell
transcriptome. These findings prompted us to perform the first of many lung transplants for patients with severe
COVID-19 in the US. Even more concerning, however, is the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in more than
30% of patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 some of whom have PF. Thus, if even a small fraction
of the 66 million US survivors of COVID-19 to date develop fibrotic lung disease, the public health impact will be
enormous. Our laboratory has made important contributions to a model that hypothesizes that lung fibrosis
begins with damage to the alveolar epithelium which leads to the recruitment circulating monocytes to the
alveolar space where they differentiate into profibrotic alveolar macrophages to create a temporary seal over the
injured alveolar epithelium and in direct contact with alveolar fibroblasts. Trophic factors for fibroblasts are
released from alveolar macrophages and fibroblasts secrete G-CSF in response, which is necessary to sustain
alveolar macrophages and creates a profibrotic circuit that persists until the epithelial barrier is restored.
Metformin is an oral drug used for Type 2 diabetes that also ameliorates fibrosis in animal models but has not
been associated with improved outcomes in PF patients. Our preliminary data suggest these disparate findings
might reflect the pharmacokinetics of the drug—high levels of drug in the lung are only achieved with
intraperitoneal but not gut administration. Thus, while metformin may not be useful as a therapy for lung fibrosis,
small molecules that mimic its mechanism of action might be. However, this requires a mechanistic
understanding of metformin’s efficacy in lung fibrosis which is currently lacking. Metformin is concentrated in
mitochondria where it functions to inhibit Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. We have
identified a yeast protein, NDI1, that restores mitochondrial electron transport in the absence of complex I activity
and is insensitive to metformin. Using this construct, we have shown that many of metformin’s biologic effects
are attributable to its ability to inhibit complex I. We have also generated preliminary data suggesting a direct
activator of AMPK, an indirect target of metformin, prevents fibrosis after the intratracheal administration of
bleomycin. These data support our overarching hypothesis that modulation of mitochondrial metabolism is
necessary for the development of lung fibrosis, offering a novel therapeutic opportunity. We propose using novel
genetic tools to determine whether and how mitochondrial electron transport can be targeted for therapy to
ameliorate fibrosis in two interrelated Specific Aims. In the first aim we will determine whether metformin inhibits
complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in the alveolar epithelium to activate AMPK and attenuate
lung fibrosis. In the second aim we will determine whether metformin inhibits complex I of the mitochondrial
electron transport chain and activates AMPK to prevent the recruitment or differentiation of profibrotic MoAM.
Our studies are founded on unbiased, rigorous and reproducible data from patients with PF and murine models
of lung fibrosis and will have immediate implications for therapy. We will credential a widely used metabolic
therapy with an acceptable risk profile, metformin, and determine its mechanism of action during lung fibrosis
which could be leveraged to identify drugs/formulations with more favorable pharmacokinetics in humans."
10805035,"Microglial/macrophage activation contributes to neuronal injury after traumatic brain injury (TBI),
primarily through release of cytokines, proteases, and reactive oxygen species. Recent studies
from our lab and others show that these aspects of microglia/macrophage activation can be
suppressed by limiting glucose flux through glycolysis. Activated microglia/macrophages are
unique among brain cells in that they primarily utilize hexokinase-2 (Hk2) rather than
hexokinase-1, thus enabling selective targeting of glycolysis in these cells. The over-riding aim
of this proposal is to determine if Hk2 inhibition can suppress pathogenic aspects of
microglial/macrophage activation and improve outcomes in a mouse model of TBI. We will
assess microglial gene expression, cytokine expression, oxidant production, and neural and
microvascular injury in transgenic mice in which Hk2 is selectively deleted in the
microglial/macrophage lineage, and in wild-type mice treated with Hk2 inhibitors at time points
after controlled cortical impact. A single Hk2 inhibitor will then be chosen for assessments of
long term histological and behavioral outcomes after TBI. We will place a particular focus on the
effects of these interventions on neurite (dendrite and axon) loss after TBI, as our findings to
date indicate inflammation to be a major determinant of neurite degeneration. In parallel, studies
using cultured microglia will assess the effects of Hk2 inhibition on overall glycolytic rate, gene
expression and pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. These studies will also evaluate a
potential mechanism by which glycolytic inhibition influences microglial/ macrophage activation.
Of note, selective Hk2 inhibitors are now entering clinical use for other purposes, thus facilitating
potential translation of these studies to clinical treatment of TBI."

The gastrointestinal tract is colonized by trillions of normally beneficial microbes (termed the microbiota), as well
as serves as an entry site for pathogens. Therefore, the intestinal immune system must remain tolerant to foreign
non-harmful stimuli meanwhile provide protection against infections. Accumulating evidence indicates that a
dysregulated immune response in the intestine is causally associated with infectious, inflammatory, and
metabolic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite these advances, the cellular and
molecular mechanisms controlling protective versus inflammatory properties of immune responses within the
intestine remain incompletely defined. The long-term goal of the candidate is to investigate how diverse immune
and stromal cells are regulated to promote health and homeostasis in the mammalian intestine. The candidate’s
recent work identified a novel transcription factor that is expressed by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) and
specifically restrains the proinflammatory properties of ILC3s to promote intestinal health and protect against
inflammation (Zhou et al., Nature, 2022). Based on this and new preliminary data, the candidate hypothesizes
that this transcriptional regulator is an essential immune modulator limiting tissue inflammation and promoting
intestinal health by acting across distinct cell types. The objectives of this proposal are to understand the
regulation and functions of this transcription factor in intestinal health and inflammation across distinct cell types.
Aim 1 will identify the direct targets of this transcription factor and how it regulates intestinal immunity. Aim 2
will investigate its functional significance in inflammation and dissect the molecular mechanisms by which it
controls intestinal inflammation. Aim 3 will determine the upstream signals that modulate expression of this
transcription factor, assess the impacts of intestinal inflammation on gene expression, and interrogate the
physiological consequences of these context-dependent expression alterations in intestinal health and
inflammation. The results from this proposal will advance our understanding of essential pathways that shape
mucosal immunity and impact the pathogenesis of IBD, which could provoke the development of novel
therapeutic strategies targeting this transcriptional regulator or downstream mediators in inflammatory disorders
of the gut. Career goals of the candidate are to become an independent investigator at an academic institute
studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms that promote intestinal health. To fulfil these scientific and career
goals, the candidate has support from a multidisciplinary advisory team with extensive experience on areas
related to the proposed research and mentoring trainees to independence. The candidate has developed a plan
to acquire necessary technique skills, advance scientific writing and communication skills, and enhance
laboratory management and mentoring abilities during the K99 phase. This K99/R00 Award will permit an
outstanding training opportunity, allow the candidate to successfully complete the proposed novel research, and
flourish as an independent scientist focusing on mucosal immunity and gastrointestinal health."

ABSTRACT
This proposal seeks funding for ‘Research Immersion in Brain, Spinal cord (RIBS), and peripheral nerve
disorders’ for under-represented minority (URM) high school students during their academic summer break.
Through this program, we aim to excite, motivate, and increase awareness of common neurologic
conditions, and provide hands-on research experience to the students in active laboratories on Case
Western Reserve University (CWRU) campus. The proximity of CWRU campus to Cleveland Metropolitan
School District (CMSD) responsible for educating socioeconomically and educationally challenged youth,
and the availability of multiple (~40) NINDS-funded Faculty with active laboratories provides an optimal
opportunity for this program. Two specific aims are proposed to achieve these goals. Aim 1 will lay the
Foundation for Research Immersion by introducing the structure and function of the brain, spinal cord,
peripheral nerves, and common disorders associated with these structures in weekly educational sessions.
A didactic session of 20 minutes will be followed by small group discussions aided by the HoloLens virtual
image technology, YouTube videos, and 3D models. The group sessions will be led by 2nd and 3rd year
URM medical students to boost the confidence of students through ‘Near Peer’ mentoring. In Aim 2, each
student will be matched with a laboratory based on his/her interest for 8 weeks of hands-on Research
Immersion. During this period, the student will be guided by the principal investigator (PI) and laboratory
personnel, who will describe the overall research goal of the laboratory, and the specific project in which
the student will be involved. They will help the student in formulating a hypothesis-driven research question
based on the literature, assist in relevant research methods, collect and analyze data, and draw relevant
and meaningful conclusions. Every week, the student will be instructed by the PI on various topics of
Responsible Conduct of Research for 30 minutes. In addition, one laboratory personnel, in most cases a
postdoctoral fellow, will work closely with the student on college admission test quizzes and college
admission essay. Deliverables for the student will include an abstract of 1 page stating the hypothesis and
experimental plan after 1 week, a full paper of 6 pages with all sections completed after 6 weeks, a college
admissions essay after 7 weeks, and a poster complete with all sections for presentation to diverse
audience after 8 weeks. The student will be expected to attend scientific talks hosted by the Departments
of Pathology, Neuroscience, and Biomedical Engineering on CWRU campus, and seminars hosted by the
Office of Inclusion and Equal Opportunity. After each talk, the invited speaker will be requested to spend
15 minutes of exclusive time with the students. We believe that the RIBS program will develop the skills,
instill enthusiasm, and boost the confidence of URM students to pursue higher education and a career in
neurologic research and healthcare."

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) affects one in four people by the age of 85, and it is linked to abnormal hip morphology
including Cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). Hence, symptomatic FAI represents an ideal
condition to identify key regulators in hip OA progression. To this end, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-
seq) comparing FAI and hip OA cartilage, revealing that WNT16 expression is negatively correlated with OA
severity. We also showed that WNT16 is decreased during cartilage cell (i.e., chondrocyte) hypertrophy (a
hallmark of OA) and that WNT16 is up-regulated in chondrocytes under mechanical loading. As Transient
Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), a Ca2+-permeable ion channel, is an essential mechanosensor in
chondrocytes, our results suggest a novel link between TRPV4, WNT16, and chondrocyte
mechanobiology. Our preliminary data predict that WNT16 in chondrocytes is potentially regulated by
TRPV4-mediated signaling pathways, and WNT16 inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy via G protein-associated
signal transduction. Thus, to elucidate the functional role of WNT16 in hip OA pathogenesis and develop novel
therapies, we propose the following aims:
Specific Aim 1: To determine the genetic and epigenetic mechanism(s) of mechanoinduction of WNT16 in
chondrocytes. Agarose constructs encapsulating human stem cell-derived chondrocytes and hip primary
chondrocytes will be subjected to loading in combination of TRPV4 activator/inhibitor, and their effects on
WNT16 will be assessed. We will use novel next-generation sequencing to identify genetic and epigenetic
factors that regulate WNT16 expression in chondrocytes.
Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of WNT16 gain- and loss-of-function on chondrocyte specification,
hypertrophy, and hip OA development. We will investigate if cartilage-specific Wnt16 knockout mice exhibit
enhanced hip OA compared to control mice. We will measure OA severity, synovitis, and bone remodeling. We
will also quantify behavioral changes and pain responses, as well as determine the association of these
measurements with hip OA severity. We will use human hip primary chondrocytes with WNT16 modulation to
investigate its effects on hypertrophy.
Specific Aim 3: To elucidate altered chondrocyte cell-cell crosstalk in hip healthy/FAI/OA cartilage and to
determine if WNT16 mRNA delivery can mitigate hip OA by restoring normal WNT signaling among
chondrocyte crosstalk. We will fully characterize distinct chondrocyte phenotypes in human healthy, FAI, and
OA hip cartilage by integrating scRNA/Spatial-seq datasets. We will determine if WNT16 mRNA delivery using
nanoparticles to hip FAI/OA cartilage explants is sufficient to mitigate hip OA progression.
Impact: A mechanistic understanding of the role of WNT16 in hip cartilage homeostasis and FAI/OA will
provide insights into the development of therapeutic interventions for hip OA by targeting WNT16 signaling."

Among stroke subtypes, spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has the highest mortality and disability.
Neutrophilic inflammation is associated with poor outcomes after ICH. However, the mediators of such injury are
unknown. Neutrophils are known to secrete neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are complexes of DNA
and proteins, that neutrophils can secrete into the blood as part of an innate immune response. NETs also
facilitate endothelial injury and thrombosis. Previously, NETs have been therapeutically targeted in animal
models in other disease entities. In ICH, edema formation through endothelial disruption and ischemic lesions
through microthrombosis are prime candidates for NET-mediated tissue injury. Both are associated with poor
outcomes. However, the contribution of NETs to edema and ischemic events after ICH has not been investigated.
This proposal seeks to biochemically measure markers of harmful neutrophil inflammation (NETs),
transendothelial tissue migration (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1, sICAM-1), and resulting neuronal
injury (neurofilament lightchain, NfL) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with ICH, and assess local tissue
injury (perihemorrhagic edema, PHE volumes), and remote tissue injury (new ischemic lesions) using an
innovative MRI approach with high spatial resolution and short imaging time. The proposed research will
demonstrate 1) a contribution of NETs to PHE and new ischemic lesions, framed by increased neutrophil tissue
infiltration and resulting neuronal death, and will thereby shed light on this mechanism of neutrophil tissue injury
in ICH, and identify potential treatment targets to prevent secondary injury after ICH, and 2) the feasibility of a
precise MRI sequence that will make PHE measurements a usable study endpoint in future ICH treatment trials.
This proposal will allow the candidate to transition to independence with expertise in biomarker validation, clinical
trial conduct, and implementation of MRI markers as study endpoints in hemorrhagic stroke studies. The
acquired expertise through this proposal will allow the candidate to prospectively study new therapies for ICH
using tissue-based definitions of therapeutic success in addition to conventional outcome measures.
The candidate has the support of an interdisciplinary team led by the co-primary mentors (1) Dr. Ramon Diaz-
Arrastia, an expert in the field of molecular and imaging biomarkers in neurological disease, and (2) Dr. Scott
Kasner, an internationally distinguished stroke trialist. The committed collaborators will provide expertise in the
use of novel MRI measures as study endpoints in studies on ICH (neuroimaging acquisition, analysis, and
interpretation). All mentors and collaborators are committed to the success of the proposed research and to
guiding the candidate in becoming an independent clinician-scientist and expert in the field of secondary injury
with the long-term goal to find therapies directed against neutrophil-mediated tissue injury in patients with ICH."

 Background: Following surgical resection for intractable epilepsy caused by malformations of cortical
development (MCDs), over 30% of children continue to have life-changing seizures. Mutations in genes of the
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway lead to these disorders that include focal cortical dysplasia
(FCD), tuberous sclerosis complex and hemimegalencephaly. Therefore, there is a critical need to discover the
specific mechanisms by which increased mTOR signaling leads to the development of epilepsy to develop
specific therapies for children with MCDs. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that mTOR pathway
upregulation in pyramidal cells causes axon overgrowth, creating an epileptogenic network in both mouse and
human MCDs
 Methods: The first step in testing the central hypothesis will be to determine the effect of mTOR pathway
upregulation on axonal length in mouse FCD and human MCDs via quantifiable analysis of fluorescently labeled
murine axons of and by 3D reconstruction of individually filled human neurons. A second set of experiments will
be performed to determine whether some pyramidal neurons act as operational hub cells in human and mouse
MCDs. Calcium imaging on ex vivo brain slices of mouse and human tissue will be used to define the local
network connectivity and identify hub cells. Finally, axonal degeneration will be induced in vivo in dysplastic cells
in mouse FCD to determine the effect of targeted reduction in axon length on seizure frequency.
 Implications: The proposed research will help to determine whether axonal overgrowth is a key mechanism
by which mTOR upregulation leads to the generation of pharmacoresistant epilepsy in children with MCDs.
Additionally, this project will demonstrate whether targeting axonal overgrowth offers the potential for treatment
of seizures. Thus, the results of this research will provide further biological understanding of MCD and provide
hope for rational development of future successful therapies for children with this set of disorders.
 Career Development Plan: During the five years of this award, Dr. Alexander will work with a team of
mentors to achieve six specific career goals which allow her to accomplish this project and will also cement her
transition to independent investigator. With hands-on mentorship and a focused set of coursework, she will work
towards three training goals. These are as follows: 1) to obtain training and mentorship in the principles and
techniques of molecular neuroscience; 2) to obtain mentorship and training in neuronal network analysis using
calcium imaging; and 3) to obtain training and mentorship in laboratory management as a neurosurgeon-
scientist. Dr. Alexander is a pediatric neurosurgeon at Children's Hospital Colorado. Her chairman and division
chief continue to support 50% protected time through on-campus resources which include dedicated research

My lab is broadly interested in understanding how cellular differentiation is controlled within a continuously
renewing epithelial tissue. Conserved features of these tissues that are not fully understood and unify studies
across experimental systems include a flexible niche structure, a “transit amplification” stage which typically has
significant cellular plasticity, and the ability of neighboring stem cell lineages to compete for niche occupancy.
To understand these emergent properties of tissues, we have focused on approaches that allow for the study of
cell behaviors within the native, in vivo context in at cellular resolution. Our primary model system is the follicle
epithelium of the Drosophila ovary, and we have recently extended our studies into the mouse intestinal
epithelium. Our contributions over the past ten years include identifying the source and identity of the follicle
stem cell (FSC) niche ligands, defining a self-renewal network for FSCs, describing new mechanisms that
promote the segregation of stem cell and daughter cell fates, and the establishment and use of the FSC lineage
as a model for understanding stem cell niche competition. Our current studies are investigating three
interconnected areas. First, we created a cell atlas of the Drosophila ovary that describes the identity, position,
and gene expression profile of over a dozen known and novel cell types. This project has provided useful new
tools that are allowing us to investigate the lineage plasticity of cells in the tissue and has led, for example, to
the discovery that niche cells can convert to stem cells during physiological stress. In addition, these tools provide
us with a new opportunity to study how a dynamic population of niche cells is able to maintain a stable pool of
FSCs amid changing tissue demands. Second, we are investigating the molecular mechanisms that govern
stem cell niche competition. We have identified a broad class of alleles that cause hypercompetition for the niche,
and we are using genetics, quantitative imaging, and mathematical modeling to understand the basis for
selection of one lineage over another. We have also extended these studies into the mouse intestinal epithelium
and found that the process is at least partially conserved. Third, we are investigating the role of intracellular pH
(pHi) in regulating cell fate decisions. We demonstrated that pHi increases during differentiation in both the FSC
lineage and mouse embryonic stem cells, and that this increase in pHi is necessary for differentiation. In
unpublished studies, we discovered a similar requirement for increased pHi in the mouse intestinal stem cell
lineage. Currently, we are focused on understanding how pHi regulates cell fate, with an emphasis on candidate
“pH sensor” proteins, such as β-catenin, that have a pKa within the physiological range. For these proteins, the
gain or loss of a proton functions like a post-translational modification, thus linking pH dynamics to changes in
protein activities that may affect cell fate. By studying these emergent properties within well-characterized
Drosophila and mouse epithelia, we are gaining detailed insights into the process of normal tissue homeostasis
that will provide a foundation for a better understanding of how tissue homeostasis fails during aging and disease."

Pediatric chronic pain is a common but understudied health problem, with prevalence increasing from
childhood to adolescence, particularly among girls. Moreover, prevalence rates have increased over the past
20 years for unknown reasons. Despite the high prevalence and enduring impact, we know little about its
etiology and developmental progression. The literature documents associations between exposure to early
adversity and chronic pain among adults, but little is known about the early developmental time course, key
mechanisms, and social resilience that can mitigate risk in youth. Critical questions need to be addressed
before efforts at prevention and intervention can have maximum impact. To that end, the proposed competing
continuation project focuses on four aims: identify the genetic and environmental influences on growth in pain
across childhood and adolescence (Aim1); examine the role of stress exposure in the development of
children's chronic pain (Aim 2); and evaluate two potential mechanisms linking stress and pain, problems with
emotion regulation (Aim 3), and epigenetics (Aim 4). Under a recalibration model, we also explore social
resilience in adolescence as a buffer of these risk processes. To accomplish our aims, we propose to conduct
intensive longitudinal follow-up assessments (at 14, 15, and 16 years of age) of a birth-records-based
community sample of 350 pairs of twins who are diverse in ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Stress,
emotion regulation, and recurring pain during early and middle childhood have already been well
characterized. Assessments during adolescence will take a multi-method approach that includes clinical and
diary assessments of pain frequency, intensity, duration; objective, diary, and questionnaire assessments of
emotion regulation, stress, and social resilience; and objective assessments of epigenetics. Our genetically
informed developmental approach to understanding the etiology and mechanisms of pain in youth is critical to
determining when benign chronic pain is clinically significant and identifying key targets for intervention efforts
to prevent the development of and promote recovery from chronic pain among youth."
10798213,"Mutations in PKD1 are responsible for over 85% of cases in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
(ADPKD). A number of studies by us and others have implicated that the ADPKD proteins polycystin-1 and -2
(PC1 and PC2) modulate a number of cellular events and signaling pathways such as Ca2+ signaling, JAK-
STAT, mTOR, cyclic AMP (cAMP), and planar cell polarity (PCP). How polycystins modulate these pathways,
however, remains elusive. The sequence of these signaling events is unknown. A major challenge is that many
experiments have been performed using different model systems, different cell types, and under different
conditions. Better understanding of the cystogenic mechanisms and disease progression of ADPKD is a high
priority for clinical care. Our long-term goal of this proposal is to identify and modulate the factors controlling
cyst formation and enlargement in ADPKD using multidisciplinary approaches. We previously reported a
biochemical interaction between PC1 and protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 2 (Pacsin
2), a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that has been implicated in cytoskeletal organization and vesicle trafficking.
By in vitro studies, we found that PC1, Pacsin 2 and N-Wasp are in the same protein complex and deficiency
of either PC1 or Pacsin 2 leads to defects in actin cytoskeleton and cell migration in cultured cells. Here we
propose to extend our study of Pacsin 2 to multiple orthologous mouse models of ADPKD that we have
developed to understand mechanisms suppressing cystogenesis. We aim to develop an in vivo imaging
protocol of cell migration and to elucidate the role of Pascin 2 in cystogenesis using multidisciplinary
approaches including the analysis the cystogenic proteome and phosphoproteome in human and mouse
ADPKD models using the latest quantitative proteomics technology, coupled with innovative bioinformatics
tools.
The proposed studies will likely discover novel therapeutic targets central to the early event(s) in cystogenesis."

Neuroimaging is a cornerstone of patient care for patients with brain injury. High field magnets and access to
imaging interpretation have prevented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from becoming a universally
available tool. Our group has demonstrated the feasibility of acquiring clinically useful images on a portable,
low-field MRI. In this proposal, we will validate the use and successful deployment of a portable, mobile MRI
into the acute stroke setting. In current practice, all patients, including those that are critically ill, must be
transported to a centralized, controlled-access environment to obtain an MRI at a single time point, in a highly
inaccessible paradigm. Our hypothesis is that a highly portable, low-field MRI can be deployed into nearly any
setting on a platform that provides real-time, automated neuroimaging analysis. Development of this solution
incorporates engineering and technological innovation (low field MRI), methodological innovation
(imaging reconstruction techniques, machine learning approaches to automated diagnosis), and conceptual
innovation (changing clinical workflow to accommodate a non-invasive method capable of point-of-care and
serial MRI). Our key rationale is that we can expand already available treatments, facilitate decision making,
and inform new approaches to patient care when we reposition the availability of MRI on a near-universal
scale. The fundamental insight is that a low field, portable MRI solution, including advanced methods in image
quality, reconstruction, and interpretation, can make imaging available to virtually any patient. We will bring
MRI technology and interpretation to an individual patient's bedside and in doing so create a platform for
MR imaging and analysis on an unprecedented scale. Because the instrument is inexpensive, does not have
cooling requirements and operates on a standard 15A 120V electrical source, project success would
democratize diagnostic MR imaging for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. In this proposal, we will develop,
quantify, and validate the measure of certainty required for transition into clinical care. Stroke has been
carefully chosen because of the substantial public health burden and existing treatment options that are
available but currently limited because of the requirement for acute neuroimaging. We have developed a
highly collaborative and multidisciplinary framework, with leading experts in low field MRI, machine learning,
stroke, multicenter studies, clinical and translational research. Embedded as well in our team is the expertise
to immediately take this exciting solution to a variety of novel settings (e.g. ambulance, low/middle income
countries). Our industry partner, Hyperfine, is the first company in the world to develop a truly portable MRI
solution, in collaboration with our academic team over the last three years. As we prospectively develop,
troubleshoot, and fine-tune our solution at two leading institutions (Yale and MGH), we have assembled a
broad scientific team to incorporate technological, clinical workflow, and health systems factors so that our
solution is ready to deploy in any clinical setting to improve patient care across human health."

Upper gastrointestinal symptoms may result from gastric dysfunction including reduced gastric accommodation
and gastric hypersensitivity, and may cause functional dyspepsia (FD), a very common cause of substantial
morbidity estimated to affect 10% of the population. FD manifests as abdominal pain/discomfort for at least
three days per week which may be associated with eating. An estimated 40% of patients with this symptom
complex consult their physicians, negatively influencing their workplace attendance and productivity with
overall economic impact of more than $18 billion in 2009. Development of effective treatments of these
disorders is desirable, given significant unmet medical need. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the
literature have shown low levels of efficacy with current treatments which include proton pump inhibitors, H
pylori eradication, prokinetics, and central neuromodulators. There is currently no approved treatment for
functional dyspepsia. We have developed a noninvasive imaging method to simultaneously measure gastric
accommodation and gastric emptying, one or both of which are reported to be altered in up to 75% of patients
with functional dyspepsia. The approved NK 1 receptor (NK1R) antagonist aprepitant has been shown to
increase fasting gastric volume and postprandial accommodation in healthy participants without deleteriously
affecting gastric emptying. The novel NK1R antagonist, tradipitant, was previously shown to reduce symptoms
in patients with gastroparesis although the precise mechanism, overall effects, and benefit-risk ratio of this
medication unclear. Our general hypothesis is that tradipitant relieves symptoms in patients with functional
dyspepsia as well as enhances postprandial gastric accommodation without deleterious effects on gastric
emptying. Our aims are:
1. To compare the pharmacodynamics and clinical effects of tradipitant vs. placebo on satiation, fasting and
fed gastric volume, gastric accommodation, gastric emptying, and symptoms in patients with functional
dyspepsia (and non-delayed gastric emptying at baseline) based on Leuven Dyspepsia scale and Nepean
Dyspepsia Index
2. To assess prevalence of NKR-SNP rs881 genetic variant and the pharmacogenetics effects of this variant in
NK1 gene on the pharmacodynamics of tradipitant compared to placebo on fasting and accommodation gastric
volumes, gastric emptying and satiation.
In an exploratory analysis, we shall assess the correlation between gastric accommodation and emptying in
functional dyspepsia and to compare the relationship with those previously reported in health volunteers.
Anticipated Results and Significance: We expect these studies will lead to understanding the mechanisms
of action of tradipitant in improving gastrointestinal functions and patient reported outcomes, including pain, in
patients with functional dyspepsia, addressing unmet needs of millions of American citizens."

 SUMOylation is a dynamic post-translational modification which involves the
conjugation of SUMOs (Small Ubiquitin-Like Modifiers) to the lysine residue/s of target
proteins affecting their function, localization or stability. Recent studies have reported
that SUMOylation (SUMO2/3) promotes vascular endothelial dysfunction and
accelerates atherosclerosis. This application aims to explore a redox-dependent
mechanism for the deleterious effect of SUMO2ylation in the vasculature, and identify a
novel target of SUMO2 in the vascular endothelium.
 We have observed that SUMO2 overexpression in endothelial cells promotes
oxidative stress and impairs endothelial function via the master redox regulator p66Shc.
Furthermore, we have observed that p66Shc is directly modified by SUMO2 on a critical
lysine that regulates the oxidative property of p66Shc. Based on this evidence, we
hypothesize that SUMO2ylation of p66Shc is a key molecular mechanism driving
vascular oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and atherosclerosis.
 We have generated endothelium-specific SUMO2 transgenic mice, as well as
transgenic mice expressing non-SUMO2ylatable p66Shc in the endothelium, and whole
body knockin mice expressing non-SUMO2ylatable p66Shc. We will leverage these
mice, as well as tools to manipulate SUMO2ylation of p66Shc in vitro, to answer three
fundamental questions: 1) does SUMO2 expression in the endothelium promote
endothelial dysfunction and accelerate atherosclerosis; 2) is SUMO2ylation of p66Shc
responsible for SUMO2-induced endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis; and 3)
how does SUMO2ylation of p66shc promote endothelial oxidative stress.
 Answers to these important questions will establish the role of SUMO2 as a post-
translational modification that impairs vascular endothelial function and promotes
atherosclerosis via p66Shc. Advancing this knowledge could potentially lead to SUMO2-
directed therapies for atherosclerotic vascular disease."
10812324,"There is little doubt that we are in the midst of a worldwide epidemic of obesity. Almost two-thirds of adults in the
United States are obese or overweight. Whether if obesity arises from genetic factors or high caloric intake, it
still may lead to insulin resistance and type II diabetes. Our recent data show that bilirubin (BR), which has been
typically considered as an antioxidant, may function as a metabolic ligand that signals to the nuclear receptor
transcription factor PPARα to reduce lipid accumulation. We also found that BR induces the hepatic fibroblast
growth factor 21 (FGF21) hormone via PPARα, which is known to have systemic effects on insulin sensitivity.
Hepatic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance are interlocking pathophysiologic events, but the mechanisms
of these abnormalities, and how these distinct processes interact, are inadequately understood. For unknown
reasons, BR plasma levels are lower in the obese, and several obese patients progress to nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD), which is likely due to obesity-induced insulin resistance. However, in patients with
pathological liver disease such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome, the BR plasma levels are very high. This paradox
may be explained by the hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1 (UGT1A1) enzyme that conjugates BR to
make it soluble and for deposition into bile and eventually into the intestine, which lowers unconjugated BR from
the blood. In humans, a polymorphism in the UGT1A1 gene (UGT1A1*28), known as Gilbert’s syndrome (GS),
reduces expression resulting in increased plasma BR levels but not in liver disease. We have shown that
humanized mice with the Gilbert’s polymorphism (UGT1A1*28) on a high-fat diet have significantly higher plasma
BR levels, reduced adiposity and insulin intolerance, and are resistant to fatty liver disease. Agents that regulate
Ugt1a1 during weight gain or loss are unknown. In the preliminary data, we show exciting data that microRNA-
365 (miR365) suppresses Ugt1a1 expression and increases plasma BR levels. We also found that Ugt1a1
expression is higher in the livers of obese mice, while miR365 and plasma BR levels are lower, which indicates
that miR365 targeting Ugt1a1 may be beneficial in increasing plasma BR to regulate adiposity. Our central
hypothesis is that BR functions as a metabolic ligand that activates the liver PPARα-FGF21 pathway to reduce
adiposity and insulin resistance. We will pursue this plan with three primary scientific aims: 1) Determine the
selectivity of BR on PPAR isoforms; 2) Determine the systemic effects of BR mediated by hepatic FGF21; and,
3) Determine if miR365 elevation of BR reduces adiposity and insulin resistance via PPARα. Collectively, this
project is the first systematic investigation of the BR-PPARα-FGF21 module and its control of insulin resistance

Acinar epithelial cells can undergo a highly regulated acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), wherein
resident acinar cells of the pancreas undergo trans-differentiation into ductal-like cells. In the
context of damage to pancreas (pancreatitis), this process is adaptive and apparently reversible,
where the ductal-like cells that have undergone ADM completely restore their acinar identity by
undergoing acinar cell reprogramming. However, in the presence of mutant Kras, ADM cells
remain ductal and are unable to reprogram into acinar cells, forcing their continued development
down the ductal lineage. We have identified central molecular determinants of ADM, including
key transcription factors such Prrx1 and Sox9. Despite this, very little remains known regarding
the alterations that distinguish “adaptive” ADM (i.e. pancreatitis or injury-induced), which does
not result in PanIN (preneoplasia), from “oncogenic” ADM (i.e. mutant Kras induced), which does.
Additional features of ADM process are unknown – namely, what ‘gatekeepers’ control trans-
differentiation of acinar cells and how the pancreas microenvironment participates in these cell
fate transitions.
Our objective is to study acinar cell fate and to define the key points at which the tightly regulated
process of ADM is dysregulated. First, in several prior studies, we have defined Prrx1 as a central
determinant of ADM formation. Second, we have begun to identify differences in the chromatin
landscape of adaptive versus oncogenic ADM and highlight the AP-1 member Fra1 as a firm
mediator distinguishing oncogenic and adaptive ADM through new in vivo data. Third, we have
identified new cell extrinsic roles for epithelial Fra1 to act as an organizer of a microenvironment
that fosters ADM. Together, our central hypothesis is that oncogenic ADM features central
mediators distinct from those in adaptive ADM that drive subsequent inflammatory and
preneoplastic states. Our collaborative teams (Rustgi-Columbia, NYC and Chandwani-Weill
Cornell, NYC) will pursue the following interrelated Specific Aims: (1) Define the role of Fra-1
(cell intrinsic) in mediating the switch from adaptive to oncogenic ADM; (2) Delineate how
coordinate activation of Prrx1 and Sox9 controls acinar cell responses in ADM; (3)
Determine the cell-extrinsic effect(s) of Fra-1 in organizing an ADM-promoting
microenvironment. Together, our innovative studies now focus on three specific aspects of the
ADM process – Prrx1-Sox9 activation, Fra1 dependency, and microenvironment contributions --
–– that will further illuminate the key biological processes that ensure an appropriate response to
tissue-level injury in the pancreas."
10812328,"The proper control of pain is one of the most important areas in health care. We still rely heavily on opioid
narcotics for acute and chronic pain control despite growing evidence of their risks and lack of strong efficacy.
In surgical populations, where opioid prescribing is common and often believed to be good practice, the
amount and duration of post-operative opioid prescriptions are strongly related to subsequent opioid misuse,
and perioperative opioid use is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Total knee arthroplasty
(TKA) is one of the most common orthopaedic procedures performed. While knee pain is often a complaint that
precedes TKA, the procedure itself is associated with considerable post-operative pain lasting days to weeks.
Data suggest that adequate post-operative pain control in this population is an important factor in determining
surgical outcomes, recovery time, and hospital length of stay. While the technology associated with the TKA
procedure itself has developed rapidly in the past several years, post-operative pain management techniques
have not changed substantially in several decades, and despite the currently employed pain-management
strategies, patients still report considerable post-operative pain, and often struggle to complete post-operative
physical therapy regimens. New analgesic strategies are needed that can be used adjunctively with existing
strategies that have the potential to reduce reliance on opioid analgesia, and reduce post-operative pain.
Several novel brain stimulation technologies including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are
beginning to demonstrate promise as treatments for a variety of pain conditions including perioperative pain. In
a series of recent studies, the PI has shown that tDCS can reduce post-operative opioid use by as much as
43% while simultaneously reducing subjective pain ratings. This recent scientific work (and the work of others)
suggests that stimulating pain-modulating areas of the human cortex with tDCS has the potential to yield
meaningful analgesic effects and reduce post-operative opioid consumption with minimal risks or side-effects.
Another non-pharmacologic approach to pain-management with minimal risks and good potential benefit is
cognitive behavioral therapy for pain (CBT-P). CBT-P has consistently demonstrated solid empirical support as
an effective treatment for chronic pain, but it is less well-studied in perioperative settings. Nonetheless, a few
small studies have demonstrated that brief cognitive-behavioral interventions hold promise as adjunctive post-
operative pain management strategies, but more work is needed. Interestingly, accumulating data from our
group suggest that tDCS of the prefrontal cortex may augment the analgesic effects of cognitive-behavioral
(CB) interventions for acute pain. When combined with a brief cognitive-behavioral intervention for acute
pain, tDCS appears to enhance the analgesic benefits of the cognitive-behavioral intervention while
improving participants’ subjective capacity to benefit from it. It appears that tDCS may be able to prime
neural circuits that facilitate engagement of brain areas involved with pain-reducing cognitions and behavioral
patterns. Thus, when cognitive-behavioral pain management strategies are taught to patients during tDCS,
more analgesic benefit is observed than with either intervention alone. To date, no studies to date have directly
investigated analgesic benefits of combining these approaches in the post-operative arena. The proposed
study will be the first ever to (1) determine the independent effects of post-operative tDCS and a brief
cognitive-behavioral intervention on post-operative pain, opioid use and functioning following TKA, (2)
determine the effects of combining tDCS with a brief cognitive-behavioral intervention, and (3) determine
longer-term outcomes of post-operative tDCS and a cognitive-behavioral intervention on pain, opioid use,
quality of life, and functioning in TKA patients. This innovative, high-quality clinical trial has the potential to
generate findings that could shift the modern paradigm of post-operative pain management to take advantage
of recent neuroscience and behavioral-science developments."
10813121,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Lupus nephritis occurs in a majority of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus), and is a
leading cause of morbidity and mortality. CD4+ and CD8+ T effector cells contribute to the inflammatory
response in lupus nephritis in mice and in humans with their renal infiltration correlated to tissue damage and
disease severity. Yet, there is limited knowledge of the phenotypic characteristics of the T cells that promote
local tissue injury in lupus. The kidney microenvironment becomes hypoxic as a common denominator
following a variety of insults, an appropriately physiologic response analogous to that which occurs to ensure
lymphocyte survival and effector function during environmental stress, such as at sites of pathogen replication
or in tumors. We have shown in preliminary studies that this response in the murine lupus kidney results in
tissue adaptive transcriptional and phenotypic changes in renal infiltrating T cells, changes associated with
epigenetic modification, with evidence that analogous changes occur in human lupus nephritis. We now
propose in this revised application sto explore the hypothesis that environmental stress in the lupus kidney
necessarily shapes the phenotypes of renal-infiltrating T cells, with programming for survival and effector
function, culminating in tissue injury. We will explore this hypothesis using in vitro and in vivo studies, including
genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of tissue adaptive effector pathways in renal T cells, with target
confirmation in human lupus nephritis. Our longer term goal, if the current project is successful, is to use this

Each year, 50.000 women are diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the US. DCIS is a non-invasive
form of breast cancer, which respects the natural tissue barriers of the breast, and is therefore not life-
threatening. However, some of these DCIS lesions overrule natural tissue barriers imposed by healthy breast
tissue, leading to invasive and metastatic breast cancer (IBC), a life-threatening disease. There is currently no
way to predict which DCIS will progress into IBC, causing all women diagnosed with DCIS to be treated with
invasive surgery and systemic therapy, causing overtreatment, harmful side effects, and psychological burden,
while also using valuable resources in healthcare systems. One of the caveats of clinical DCIS research is the
natural progression, which cannot be followed over time, as almost all patients are treated with surgical excision
when a lesion is detected. Therefore, the dynamics and natural course of DCIS growth and invasive
transformation remain poorly understood. To resolve this lack of dynamic information, PI Scheele at VIB, together
with collaborating labs at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, has developed the first living biobank of >100 patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) models of DCIS directly derived from human samples through orthotopic injections.
This biobank is a full representation of the patient population, and represents all DCIS molecular subtypes,
morphological growth patterns, histological features and grade, with high concordance with the original patient
samples. PI Scheele’s team also developed a way to analyze DCIS progression using a 3D whole-gland imaging
technique to study lesion size, location, and growth pattern in the intact tissues to better assess the growth
pattern of the different lesions. Using this approach, the team has shown that 3D growth pattern provides a much
better prediction for invasive progression than the classical markers derived from 2D histopathology. The VIB
team has identified that all DCIS lesions can be classified into two distinct 3D growth patterns: replacement
growth and expansive growth. Only the expansive growth pattern strongly correlates with invasion, whereas
replacement lesions never progress into invasive disease. However, the mechanisms by which one growth
pattern progresses into invasive breast cancer, whereas the other growth pattern remains indolent remain
unknown. Additionally, it is uncertain if these PDX derived growth patterns occur in patient samples, and whether
histological analysis will allow to identify these growth patterns. PI Scheele proposes to assess these
uncertainties and to further investigate the growth patterns of DCIS by understanding how DCIS cells can
overrule the natural barriers imposed by healthy breast tissue. Using the unique cohort of DCIS-PDX models,
combined with optical barcoding, 3D imaging and longitudinal (intravital) microscopy, the VIB team aims to build
detailed spatio-temporal (xyzt) maps of DCIS growth and progression. From these 4D maps of DCIS growth and
progression, the team aims to extract predictive biomarkers, such as morphological features or marker gene
expression, that can discriminate low-risk from high-risk DCIS prior to invasion in clinical pathology practice."

Candidate: I am presently a scientist in the BRAVE Research Center (BRC), within the Department of Psychiatry
at the University of Wisconsin (UW). Career Goals: I seek to identify neural mechanisms though which childhood
adversity can perturb typical development of biobehavioral affective systems in ways that effect enduring
psychiatric risk, as well as moderative ecological factors that may provide a foundation for evidence-based
clinical efforts with vulnerable youth. Career Development: I request support for mentored training to build
knowledge and skills in four areas pertinent to my career goals: (1) theory and analysis of functional brain
networks; (2) caregivers and caregiving as ecological moderators of the linkage between victimization and
psychopathology; (3) data-driven approaches to neurobehavioral analyses and (4) professional development as
an independent investigator. Research Project: The proposed work utilizes longitudinal, multimodal
assessment data from parent-child dyads participating in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study
(N=11,875), and its Social Development sub-study (N=2,500). The primary aim is the evaluation of cross-
sectional and longitudinal changes in functional connectivity networks as mechanisms linking childhood adversity
(victimization) and caregiving practices to impairments in emotion regulation, a biobehavioral domain with
transdiagnostic relevance. First, I will extract robust functional network (static and dynamic) data from quality-
controlled ABCD resting state fMRI scans and evaluate these metrics (and their change across time) as
mediators in a structural equation model linking victimization and emotion regulation. Second, I will consider
main effects of caregiving practices (e.g., positive parenting) on functional network development, as well as
modulative impact on neurofunctional sequelae of victimization. Third, I will develop and evaluate a deep-
learning model predicting impairment in emotion regulation from neural and behavioral inputs, including regional
connectivity, caregiving practices, and exposure to victimization. These results will inform future applications
proposing independent research projects considering neurofunctional mechanisms linking adversity to
psychiatric risk in the context of granular assessment of caregiving practices, caregiver-child relationships, and
dynamics within the broader family system. Such findings may serve as the basis for developing targeted clinical
approaches translating ecological factors shown to moderate the biological and behavioral sequelae of
victimization. Environment: Activities in this proposal will be conducted at UW (BRC, Department of Psychiatry)
under the mentorship of esteemed scientists working in areas of affective and developmental neuroscience,
neural and behavioral sequelae of adversity, quantitative modeling of developmental processes, and machine
learning, led by Drs. Ryan Herringa, Seth Pollak, and Vikas Singh (respectively), each of whom possesses
extensive experience mentoring early career investigators."

Biomedical and bioengineering research are interdisciplinary fields of science that have led to medical
applications, biotechnology innovations and basic research discoveries. However, the lack of educational
resources and research opportunities available to underrepresented groups (UR) has limited the diversity of
scientists that pursue biomedical research careers. The Building Early Awareness and Research in Science
(BEARS) at California State University San Marcos, a NIBIB ESTEEMED program, will support 15 talented UR
undergraduates interested in biomedical sciences from matriculation through acceptance into an advanced
honors program; the ultimate goal is for them to complete their B.S. degrees, obtain admission to Ph.D. or
M.D./Ph.D. programs, and increase the number of underrepresented biomedical scientists in the nation’s
workforce. The three primary goals of the program are to 1) empower BEARS Scholars to accumulate
personal, academic and research skills necessary to persist and complete their B.S. degree program, enter an
advanced honors program in their junior year, and apply to graduate school in the biomedical sciences; 2)
provide a comprehensive mentoring team that supports the academic, research, career, and
personal/social/peer needs of the Scholars during their critical first few years; and 3) train BEARS Scholars to
be STEM Ambassadors to aid in diversity recruitment, promote local awareness of biomedical and
bioengineering careers, and develop leadership skills. Over three summers and two academic years, the
BEARS program combines a variety of new workshops and events with leveraged campus opportunities to
address several specific aims including: a) strengthen their college survival skills, and quantitative and
computational competence (Q&C) in core sciences by participating in an early summer bridge program and a
series of increasingly challenging Q&C workshops; b) build their confidence, identity, and communication skills
as scientists by participating in inclusivity workshops, presenting their research findings, and making
presentations to high schools and the public; c) foster their passion and interest in biomedical and
bioengineering careers by participating in research trainings, activities, and conducting independent research
at CSUSM and with partner faculty at UCSD in the Orthopaedic Surgery and Bioengineering Departments.
BEARS scholars will then enter one of our many existing and high successful advanced honors programs (U-
RISE, McNair, LSAMP) in which they will receive comprehensive longitudinal faculty, grantsmanship training,
research and peer mentorship which will help them continue their careers into graduate schools and the
biomedical workforce. Ultimately, the BEARS program will help decrease the nationwide diversity gap in
biomedical research and help talented UR students become thoughtful scholars of science."

SARS-CoV-2 exploits the function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to promote its
infection life cycle. Despite its strong reliance on the ER, the molecular basis by which
SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ER factors to promote defined steps of this life cycle remains
unclear. Using infectious SARS-CoV-2, we recently identified two ER membrane
proteins – RTN3 and SigmaR1 – as critical host factors that support virus infection. Our
findings further reveal that RTN3 plays a role in viral replication, while SigmaR1 exerts a
function in viral secretion. However, how SARS-CoV-2 exploits the activities of RTN3
and SigmaR1 to accomplish these two distinct tasks, in mechanistic terms, is completely
unknown. Accordingly, the objective of this application is to elucidate the molecular basis
by which these two ER membrane factors promote replication and secretion of SARS-
CoV-2. We believe these insights will not only illuminate the basic infection mechanism
of SARS-CoV-2, but given the continuing global COVID-19 pandemic, may lead to the
development of effective anti-virals to blunt the devastating impact of SARS-CoV-2."

The primary goal of this 5-year project is to renew a cooperative agreement for the continued
support of the Western Center for Food Safety (WCFS). The WCFS functions as a dynamic
collaborative partnership between FDA and the University of California, Davis, and also as one
of four academic Centers of Excellence that support the mission-critical food safety and public
health goals promoted by FDA. The long-term goals of the WCFS are five-fold: (1) conduct
multidisciplinary applied laboratory, field, and educational research regarding the safety of
agriculture production to generate practical solutions that can be implemented by the
agricultural community and consequently, enhance food safety for FDA-regulated products; (2)
develop and maintain communication with various stakeholders, domestic and international,
involved in food production and food safety in order to identify food safety knowledge gaps and
opportunities to leverage resources; (3) enhance technical assistance, community outreach and
educational efforts through various venues, such as agricultural industry seminars,
presentations, serving on technical advisory boards and industry or regulatory committees,
publishing lay and scientific publications, and providing food safety education through local
agriculture extension offices; (4) engage in multi-institutional research collaborations to ensure
that FDA has the most current, scientific thinking on best agricultural practices across varying
agro-ecological landscapes; and (5) assist FDA in implementing the Food Safety Modernization
Act standards associated with the produce safety and preventive controls regulation."
10801884,"Adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV) have shown promise in some liver-based clinical trials
including hemophilia B. However, one of the limitations is the loss of the vector genomes during
tissue growth and cell division limiting the duration of expression when treatment is initiated early
in life. For success in treating a number of genetic diseases treatment early in life is required. We
previously developed a non-nuclease mediated AAV-mediated homologous recombination (AAV-
HR) approach by using genomic homology arms to insert a protein coding sequence onto the end
of the endogenous Albumin gene such that after homologous recombination, the modified locus
would make a chimeric mRNA and both the endogenous albumin protein and a second protein,
in our case human factor IX and treated the bleeding diathesis in a murine model of hemophilia
B. Subsequently, this approach has been used to treat other murine models of human
hepatodeficiency disorders and a Phase I/II clinical trial for methylmalonic acidemia was initiated
by LogicBio therapeutics. The limitation is the efficiency of the process remains low and we have
recently established that off-target integration likely can produce a proportion of the therapeutic
protein. Our goal is to further study the genomic sources of the AAV-HR produced therapeutic
product as well as parameters that influence the efficiency of AAV-HR in cells and in vivo. To do
this, we will use high-throughput sequencing approaches to molecularly characterize the origin of
off-target transcribed RNAs produced after AAV-HR mediated transduction. We will establish if
they arise from vectors that integrate into regions of microhomologies or via non-homologous end
joining as well as identify which sets of these RNAs are translated. Our preliminary data suggests
that regions of the host genome that are more robust in R-loop formation will likely be more
efficient at AAV-HR. We will directly test this hypothesis and use the information to design
improved homology arms for AAV-HR. We will also do an unbiased in vivo genetic screen in mice
to establish which genes when expression is reduced results in higher AAV-HR. We will confirm
that parameters that influence non-nuclease mediated AAV-HR also effects nuclease mediated
AAV-HR. The results from these studies will not only provide new mechanistic insights into AAV-
HR but provide new approaches for enhanced genome editing, which would broaden the
application for treating human genetic diseases."
10801408,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Glaucoma, which is often referred to as the ""silent thief of sight,"" gradually steals vision without early warning
signs or pain, and it remains the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Currently, the only known method to slow
the progression of glaucoma is to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), which helps to minimize permanent damage
to the optic nerve. However, IOP levels can fluctuate over both daily and seasonal periods, with the greatest
peaks often occurring during sleep or in a supine position. In turn, vision loss may occur during sleep, without
the patient being aware of it, even if their IOP levels are normal during daytime measurements taken in clinical
or home settings. Assessing the 24-hour pattern of IOP on a regular basis, daily, weekly, and monthly can be
highly beneficial for patients with glaucoma or those who are at risk of developing the condition, which is however
lacking in standard clinical practice. Although wearable ocular tonometers, such as the Triggerfish lens
(Sensimed, Inc.), aim to continuously monitor IOP in both clinical and home settings, their long-term use in
human eyes is currently limited, particularly during sleep, due to various side effects such as foreign body
sensation, eye pain, superficial punctate keratitis, corneal epithelial defects, and conjunctival erythema. To
address this unmet need, we propose to develop and optimize a unique class of smart soft contact lenses that
build upon existing commercial brands of soft contact lenses, without altering their intrinsic properties, including
lens power, biocompatibility, softness, transparency, wettability, oxygen transmissibility, and overnight
wearability. We anticipate that the smart soft contact lenses will offer a number of advantages over existing
wearable ocular tonometers, including superior safety, user comfort, lens fit, visual field, ease of use, overnight
wearability, and measurement accuracy. To this end, we will produce various prototypes of the smart soft contact
lenses and then iteratively conduct a comprehensive set of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo tests to assess several
key features. These include: (1) durability against perpetual cycles of mechanical loads such as flipping, folding,
and stretching, chemical treatments such as cleaning and disinfecting, and other possible user mishandling such
as dehydration, overheating, or overcooling; (2) in vitro cell viability on human corneal cells; (3) ex vivo sensing
performance in enucleated pig eyes; (4) in vivo sensing performance in dogs (without euthanasia); and (5) clinical
validity in human eyes, both in-clinic and at-home settings. We will compare the measurement results with those
obtained from the in-clinic, portable, and wearable types of current ocular tonometers such as the Goldmann
applanation tonometry (GAT), I-Care Home (I-Care, Inc.), and Triggerfish lens (Sensimed, Inc.). We envision the
smart soft contact lenses to provide continuous, 24-hour monitoring of IOP that is well-tolerated by the majority
of glaucoma patients and those suspected to have the condition. Successful outcomes of this project may also
present opportunities to broaden the use of smart soft contact lenses beyond glaucoma management, opening
the door to the continuous monitoring of other chronic ocular diseases, such as cataract and age-related macular
degeneration."

 Personality disorders are complex and debilitating disorders associated with profound risk for suicide and
substantial cost related to long-term intensive care, emergency room visits, and psychiatric hospitalizations.
Although traditionally diagnosed only in adults, emerging risk for personality pathology can be reliably assessed
in early adolescence. The level of personality functioning (LPF) is a dimensional measure of personality
pathology that predicts the development of personality disorders across the lifespan and contributes to long-term
dysfunction beyond the effects of other clinical concerns, such as anxiety, depression, attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and conduct problems. LPF refers to the degree of disturbance in self (i.e., identity)
and other (i.e., interpersonal) functioning, and as a dimensional measure, is sensitive to the individual differences
in emerging identity and interpersonal development in early adolescence. Yet very little research has examined
neurophysiological mechanisms of LPF in youth, missing critical early opportunities to target youth at risk for
some of the most stigmatized and costly conditions. Deficits in the NIMH RDoC constructs of Attachment and
Affiliation and Understanding of Self may underlie impaired LPF. At the self-report level, impaired LPF is
associated with difficulty modulating responses to social acceptance cues and accurately encoding self-relevant
information. However, examining these processes at the neural level, which is not confounded by lack of insight
or other demand characteristics, may more clearly elucidate processes underlying impaired LPF. Individual
differences in processing social acceptance cues and self-referential information can be reliably detected at the
neural level using event-related potentials (ERPs), but have not been applied to understanding personality
disorders in youth. For this work, a sample of 240 early adolescent youth (ages 10-13, 50% female) will be
recruited, the majority (n=180) from two clinically diverse outpatient psychiatry clinics, while the remaining (n=80)
youth will be comparison youth without a history of psychopathology. Neurophysiological assessments of social
acceptance processing and self-referential processing will be administered, and will be tested as predictors of
growth in LPF impairment measured over two years. LPF will be assessed using behavioral observations of
parent and peer interactions and through daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) collected over two
years. Additionally, the effect of LPF on clinical indicators, including functional impairment, suicidality, and
treatment use, will be tested, considering other key clinical concerns, including maladaptive traits, co-occurring
mental health disorders, substance use, and sociodemographic and developmental factors. Results from this
work will provide evidence to elucidate treatment targets to mitigate the long-term personal and societal burden
associated with personality disorders."
10801178,"Women Veterans are the fastest-growing population and pelvic floor disorders such as anal/fecal incontinence
(FI) are highly prevalent in women. Fecal incontinence (accidental leakage of stools; FI) that occurs in a
significant population of women (>7%), is attributed to childbirth-related injury to the external anal sphincter (EAS)
and pelvic floor muscles, by a variety of mechanisms, i.e., stretch, ischemia, spontaneous avulsions and surgical
incision (episiotomy). Many FI patients develop symptoms after about 5 decades of life and the risk increases
with advancing age, the reasons for which are not clear. In addition, these patients show anatomical disruptions
and impairment of EAS muscle function. Our animal (rabbit) studies confirm these findings and further
demonstrate abnormal healing with increased fibrosis and disorganized fiber orientation in the regenerating
muscle after experimental EAS myotomy. Similar charges were also seen in old animals. Our mechanistic studies
show upregulation of fibrosis network involving Wnt-β catenin/ STAT3 proteins and a novel central hub for multi-
receptor driven profibrogenic signaling, GIV/Girdin in the injured as well as old animals. We hypothesize that
impaired muscle regeneration/fibrosis after EAS injury as well as increased muscle atrophy observed during
advanced aging is mediated by common molecular pathways involving Wnt-Frizzled, β-Catenin/TCF/LEF, STAT-
3 and GIV/Girdin signaling proteins. A clear understanding of these molecular mechanisms involved in sphincter
fibrosis/atrophy would enable the identification of a novel target for the development of innovative strategies to
prevent/ treat this disorder. The specific aims of our studies are to determine: 1. Mechanisms of injury-related
sphincter muscle dysfunction; 2. Mechanisms of age-related sphincter muscle dysfunction, and 3. Mechanisms
of the cumulative impact of age on injury-related sphincter muscle function. We will use a rabbit model and several
novel approaches, 1; longitudinal measurement of in-vivo length tension function of the EAS muscle in animals,
2; use of Wnt antagonists (sFRP2), small molecule inhibitors (STAT3) and gene silencing (Girdin siRNA)
approach to modulate fibrogenic signaling networks with an ultimate goal of improving sphincter function in our
studies. Mechanistic insights gained from these studies will not only examine the topic from the molecular level
to the level of whole animals but also unravel novel targets for further development of treatment strategies to
prevent muscle fibrosis both in the setting of post-injury and aging-related incontinence. Thus, our proposal is
both conceptually novel (studies a novel fibrogenic signaling network), and innovative (uses novel approaches
and interventions to study sphincter and improve sphincter function), paving the way for new treatment strategies
Successful conclusion of this study has a high potential for clinical translation (development of anti-fibrotic
interventions) to maximize functional recovery (anal continence function) in the post-partum and aging population."

Black and Hispanic preschool children with developmental and disabilities (DD) have endured longstanding
disparities in accessing therapies depriving them of services across medical and educational systems that
foster developmental, behavioral, and educational outcomes. Studies also indicate parents benefit when their
children receive needed therapies with improvements in mental health, stress, and quality of life. Thus, a lack
of clinic- and early childhood special education (ECSE)-based therapies during critical periods of brain
development, including the preschool years, can substantially contribute to preventable morbidity. Racial and
ethnic health care disparities for children with DD have been documented for decades. The scientific
community has now urged for research which advances knowledge regarding the etiology of these disparities.
Much of the emphasis to date has focused on how individual-level factors contribute to disparities in
therapeutic access for children with DD. However, contextual factors, including structural racism and
discrimination (SRD), are likely a significant, but unexplored influence. The scientific objectives of this research
are to address the following existing gaps in the literature: 1) the degree to which contextual factors, as
evidenced by educational, healthcare and neighborhood indicators of SRD, drive disparities in therapeutic
access among Black and Hispanic preschool-age children with DD and impact child, parent, family and
community outcomes; and 2) the identification of modifiable protective determinants that may mitigate the
relationship between SRD and access to therapies. Our interdisciplinary team will meet the objectives of this
study by conducting a mixed methods longitudinal study enrolling 300 Black and Hispanic children with DD and
their parents from clinics across Chicago and collecting multilevel prospective data five times over a three-year
period. We will also create a Multidisciplinary Advisory Board who will meet biannually to consider how our
research findings can inform educational and health care intervention and policy. The proposed research is
significant for its potential to advance scientific knowledge about the role of SRD in sustaining health inequities;
how gaps and delays in therapeutic services impact multilevel health outcomes among Black and Hispanic
PCw/DD and their families; and the role of key protective factors in mitigating these effects. Results from this
study will provide actionable data to inform policy and the development of medical, educational, and public
health interventions towards achieving health equity for Black and Hispanic children with DD and their families."

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with no cure. Current treatment
strategies offer only partial remission, with many patients remaining refractory to treatment, and carry risks of
significant adverse events including serious infections and cancer. Thus, an improved understanding of
inflammatory signaling pathways and identification of novel preclinical mechanisms are critical challenges in
IBD research. Signaling downstream of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and toll like
receptor (TLR) pathways play major roles in IBD pathogenesis. In previous work, we discovered that the RNA
binding protein Sam68 is required for both TNF- and TLR-induced activation of the transcription factor NF-κB,
a master regulator of inflammation, suggesting that Sam68 contributes to NF-κB-dependent inflammation.
Our new preliminary results show that Sam68 is prominently expressed in human and murine intestinal
epithelial cells (IEC); Sam68 knockout (KO) mice are significantly protected from dextran sulfate sodium
(DSS)- and oxazolone-induced colitis; and Sam68 protein is significantly elevated in inflamed colons of UC
patients. Based on this, we hypothesize that Sam68 is a critical mediator of inflammation in IECs, and
targeting IEC Sam68 will provide a novel therapeutic strategy in UC via dual inhibition of TNF- and
TLR-mediated inflammatory pathways. We propose to study the molecular mechanisms of IEC-specific
Sam68 signaling in human and experimental murine colitis using cutting edge tools such as 3D colonoids
derived from UC patient colonocytes and novel IEC-specific Sam68 conditional KO (cKO) mice. Aim 1 will
delineate molecular mechanisms of IEC-specific Sam68 signaling in TNF- and TLR-induced inflammatory
signaling and identify the structural domains and posttranslational modifications of Sam68 required for its
inflammatory functions. Aim 2 will study the in vivo role(s) of Sam68 in primary IECs under homeostatic and
inflammatory conditions, using Sam68-cKO mice challenged with DSS and oxazolone as experimental colitis
models, and using a spontaneous colitis model, Sam68-cKO / Wiscott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) KO
double KO mice. This aim will utilize 3D colonoids prepared from wild type and Sam68-KO mice to study role
of Sam68 in IEC proliferation, permeability and inflammatory signaling to study the homeostatic role of Sam68.
Aim 3 will delineate the proinflammatory role of Sam68 in UC patients. This aim will study IEC-specific growth,
proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of TJ proteins, and activation of proinflammatory signaling in IEC's and
mucosal immune cells using co-culture assays of control and patient derived 3D intestinal organoids and
immune cells. Successful completion of this study will fill critical knowledge gaps in understanding novel
mechanisms underlying TNF- and TLR-dependent inflammatory signaling in UC and pave the way for the
development of novel therapeutics targeting Sam68 to treat UC. Moreover, this study will also serve as the
basis to explore the role of Sam68 in other TNF- and TLR-dependent chronic inflammatory diseases as well."

The central goal of this proposal is to elucidate how leptin transport into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
and brain is gated at the choroid plexus (ChP), how such gating influences the action of leptin on reward-
related dopaminergic neurons, and how saturated ChP transport may contribute to leptin resistance in
obesity. Regulation of energy expenditure and feeding are crucial to an animal’s ability to survive and maintain
physiological homeostasis. Leptin is an endocrine factor secreted by adipocytes that participates in the regulation
of food intake and body weight. Acting on receptors in the brain, leptin exerts an overall effect to decrease
feeding, increase energy expenditure, and promote a lean phenotype. Leptin must enter the brain to reach its
receptors. In obesity, circulating leptin levels are elevated, but the ratio of CSF to serum leptin is reduced, and
leptin suppresses food intake when administered centrally but not peripherally. This suggests insufficient
transport of leptin into the CSF as a potential contributor to the development of obesity. Preliminary work has
implicated transcytosis through the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier of the ChP epithelium as a critical pathway
of leptin entry into the brain. In fact, local deletion of endocytic receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related
protein 1 (LRP1) in the ChP epithelium impairs feeding suppression by peripheral leptin while keeping intact the
decrease in food intake in response to centrally delivered leptin. However, the real time dynamics of this
proposed transcytotic transport at the ChP are poorly understood. I propose to apply novel in vivo imaging
techniques to study leptin transcytosis through the ChP epithelium as well as its access to and effects
on leptin-sensitive dopaminergic circuitry in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in real time in awake,
behaving mice. In Aim 1, I will refine recently developed tools to visualize leptin transcytosis at the ChP in real
time (see preliminary data) and quantitatively assess the effects of LRP1 deletion or overexpression on leptin
transport from the blood into the CSF. Once it reaches the brain, leptin is known to engage a number of neural
circuits. Dopaminergic neurons in the VTA encode the motivational salience of food and are normally inhibited
by leptin, leading to reduced motivation for food consumption. In obesity, however, dysregulated VTA
dopaminergic activity promotes compulsive eating. In Aim 2, I will extend the imaging toolkit to track the access
of leptin to the VTA parenchyma in parallel with recording the activity of individual VTA dopaminergic neurons,
and rigorously assess the interplay between leptin transcytosis at the ChP and the VTA dopaminergic responses
to palatable food in lean and obese mice. Additionally, I will confirm if LRP1 overexpression in the ChP epithelium
could be protective against the development of obesity. These studies will provide novel insights into the
pathways and mechanisms of leptin entry into the brain, assess the dynamics and downstream effects of leptin
signaling with unprecedented precision, and propose new therapeutic approaches for obesity and other
metabolic disorders."

 Age-related declines on many cognitive abilities are well documented and are highly associated with
subsequent development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Nevertheless, there is great variability in cognitive
abilities across individuals in susceptibility to these age-related changes. It may help to identify potential
preventive measures by elucidating the mechanisms underlying this variability. Recent advances in cognitive
neuroscience suggests that, among the elderly, variation in cognition might be due to the differences in present
brain reserve [a combined result from peak brain reserve (peak BR; peak neurobiological capital at young age)
and the brain maintenance (BM; ability of maintain against aging-related morphologic brain decline or
pathological accumulation over time)] and cognitive reserve (CR; the extent of cognitive function exceeding
what can be expected from a certain level of brain aging or pathology). Adherence to the Mediterranean-type
diet (MeDi) is one of the top modifiable protective factors against AD and cognitive decline in the literature.
However, which of the three reserve concepts (BR, BM, and CR) play a role in the cognitive benefits of MeDi is
unclear. Obtaining insight into the role of the reserve concepts in the context of diet and AD or cognition will
assist to prioritize public health efforts and provide a firm foundation for dietary recommendations on cognitive
resilience and AD prevention. We aim to examine the respective roles of BR, BM and CR in cognitive benefits
of MeDi, using data from a unique research population which includes 562 cognitively healthy participants
aged 20-80, evaluated with multimodal brain imaging measures, a neuropsychological battery, and
questionnaires on many demographic and lifestyle factors. Five-year follow-up of the cohort is ongoing. Thus,
we are well positioned to explore the association between MeDi and present BR in all age groups, of particular
interest will be the present BR of young adults representing the peak BR. For BM, we have previously
developed relative BM measures using cross-sectional data. More importantly, the longitudinal data will allow
us to directly measure BM. Finally, we have extensive experience in CR quantification. Specifically, we will: 1)
Examine whether healthy diet such as MeDi is associated with larger BR. We will examine whether closer
adherence to MeDi is associated with larger BR in all age groups, with the association in the young adults
approximating the association of MeDi with Peak BR. 2) Examine whether MeDi is associated with BM. We will
examine whether MeDi is positively associated with a relative BM proxy using cross-sectional data, and with a
direct measure of BM (using longitudinal change of brain measures). 3) Examine whether MeDi is associated
with CR. Using cross-sectional data, we will examine whether MeDi is associated with a “residual” estimate of
CR, or with the expression of previously identified CR-brain networks. Using longitudinal data, we will examine
whether MeDi moderates the relationship between brain and cognitive change."

Ultrasound is among the world’s most widely used biomedical imaging technologies due to its low cost and ability
to visualize deep tissues with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, ultrasound has had a relatively
small role in molecular and cellular imaging due to a lack of contrast agents and reporter genes connected to
specific aspects of cellular function such as gene expression and intracellular signaling. To address this
limitation, we are developing acoustic biomolecules – proteins that can be imaged with ultrasound. These
constructs are based on gas vesicles (GVs) – a unique class of air-filled protein nanostructures from buoyant
photosynthetic microbes, which we introduced as imaging agents for ultrasound in 2014 (Nature Nano. 9:311)
and as acoustic reporter genes for commensal microbes in 2018 (Nature 554:86). Since our last renewal, we
took the next major step of demonstrating that GVs can function as reporter genes in mammalian cells (Science
365:1469, 2019 and Nature Biotech. 2023), learned how to turn GVs into dynamic biosensors of intracellular
protease activity (Nature Chem. Biol. 16:988, 2020), developed methods to detect GV-expressing cells down to
single-cell sensitivity (Nature Methods 18:945, 2021), demonstrated their utility as injectable contrast agents in
a disease context (ACS Nano 14:12210, 2020), and made several other advances in understanding and
engineering GVs and accompanying ultrasound methods and applications. Much work remains to be done to
develop GVs as targeted nanoscale contrast agents and reporter genes with broad utility in biology and medicine.
Our proposed next steps will enable specific applications of GVs in biomedical research and clinically relevant
contexts. These next steps include developing GVs as both targeted nanoscale contrast agents and acoustic
reporter genes, focusing on biomedically impactful applications in (1) labeling tumors for intraoperative
ultrasound imaging and (2) visualizing the migration and proliferation of primary immune cells during
immunotherapy. We will support the future clinical translation of these applications by establishing standardized
protocols for high quality GV production, characterizing and optimizing their in vivo tolerability and
immunogenicity and developing new nonlinear pulse sequences allowing ultrasound to nondestructively image
lower doses of injected GVs and smaller numbers of GV-expressing cells. Successful completion of this work
will result in unprecedented capabilities for ultrasonic molecular and cellular imaging and lay the foundation for
developing clinical nanoscale and cell-based diagnostics and therapeutics."
10804437,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), parenting, and social determinants of health (SDH) contribute to early
life adversity (ELA), which can disrupt development in the brain, cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune systems
to increase the risks for chronic non-communicable diseases, substance abuse, or other detrimental outcomes.
In contrast, positive childhood experiences (PCEs) can build resilience, and improve physical and mental health
outcomes. We have validated the assays for hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) to assess chronic stress
and hair oxytocin concentrations (HOC) to assess social bonding in over 1200 children. We found significant
differences in HCC/HOC by age, sex, race/ethnicity, parent income, the child’s health and ACEs exposures. We
also measured hair growth rates and hair composition, and found no effects of hair composition on HCC/HOC.
The social psychology of childhood flows from parenting and family factors, with ACEs and PCEs reflecting the
negative vs. positive experiences in the child’s social ecology. We propose an identity disruption model to study
how early social psychology and health are altered by their social ecology, using hair biomarkers to define the
role of HPA-axis (dys)regulation in mediating these outcomes. We will derive a measure of toxic stress (TS) from
ACEs, PCEs, and family factors in a prospective longitudinal study, evaluating 450 children at 6-month intervals
to see how TS affects HCC/HOC trajectories and to develop HCC criteria for HPA-axis dysregulation.
AIM 1 examines how ACEs exposures in preschool children are related to a chronic stress biomarker (HCC).
AIM 2 examines how the PCEs are related to a social bonding biomarker (HOC), and if the PCEs can protect
children from developing HPA-axis dysregulation. The degree and timing of child exposures to toxic stress will
be related to the adaptive, hyperresponsive, maladaptive, and exhaustive phases of HPA-axis (dys)regulation.
We will examine how the ACEs, PCEs, and family factors are associated with HPA-axis profiles by classifying
children into 4 groups of atypically low (0-25th), normative (25th-75th), reactive (75th-90th), or atypically high (90th-
100th) HCC percentiles. Latent class mixed models will reveal their HCC trajectories, and secondary analyses
will examine the moderating effects of parent resilience, self-esteem, mental health symptoms, and parenting
stress on HCC trajectories. This project will also establish the first-ever scalable methodology for public health
studies of HPA-axis function in children and adults, to identify those at risk for long-term effects of toxic stress
on their physical, mental, social, and relational health; thus becoming eligible for intervention trials or programs.
We have an experienced multidisciplinary team, the pilot data, and the strong community partnerships to
successfully complete the proposed project, which addresses fundamental gaps in our current knowledge,
and establishes a scientific framework for predicting long-term physical and mental health sequelae of TS.
Our research focuses on childhood trauma and traumatic stress occurring in the most sensitive periods for
HPA-axis maturation, and it also contributes to the NICHD priorities on health disparities & disease prevention."
10933506,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is a major clinical challenge due to their poor response to therapeutic
options. Although the survival rate of breast cancer (BC) patients has improved, the incidence of BCBM is
increasing with recent advance in diagnostic imaging and systemic therapy, and long-term survival rates for
these patients are unacceptably low, urgently calling for new interventions. Oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1
(oHSV) therapy is the most advanced virotherapy as approved by FDA for melanoma in the U.S. and
conditionally for glioblastoma in Japan. However, accumulating clinical data is revealing that oHSV treatment
very weakly induces a systemic anti-tumor immune response which is often offset by the immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironment (TME). Thus, mechanistic identification of the anti-viral resistance is a key to maximize
its therapeutic efficacy. In BCBM, we observed that oHSV therapy induces insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)
expression and secretion, sustaining pro-inflammatory neutrophils in the TME and polarization change to pro-
tumoral neutrophils, hampering the virus propagation and discouraging the development of a strong adaptive
anti-tumoral immune response. Additionally, we found that infiltrated neutrophils by oHSV therapy induces
neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation (also called “NETosis”), hampering the therapeutic efficiency of
Viro-Immunotherapy. The overarching goal of this application is to identify the ultimate cause of the poor clinical
response of cancer patients to oHSV therapy, and develop a more effective novel viral immunotherapy for
incurable BCBM. We aim to achieve our goal by deciphering anti-viral resistance mechanism behind oHSV-
induced IGF2/microglia/neutrophil axis, and evaluating therapeutic benefit of IGF2 inhibition and NET
degradation on oHSV therapy. To compromise oHSV-induced IGF2 and its signaling pathways, we generated a
novel IGF2-scavanging oHSV (oHSV-D11mt) and will investigate the therapeutic benefit when combined with
radiation therapy, which has also been hindered by IGF2, neutrophil infiltration and NETosis. We also generated
actin resistant DNase1-expressing oHSV (oHSV-haDNase1) to degrade the NETs for enhanced virus
propagation and access to infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes. To test these hypotheses, we will investigate the
contradictory roles of IGF2 in virus clearance and tumor progression (Aim 1), evaluate therapeutic potential of
IGF2-scavenging oHSV-D11mt in combination with radiotherapy (Aim 2), and assess the preclinical efficacy of
NET-mitigating oHSV-haDNase1 (Aim 3). The successful completion of this proposed study is expected to unveil
the role of neutrophil infiltration and NET formation induced by oHSV therapy, and elucidate why oHSV therapy
was not as successful as viral immunotherapy as expected. Therefore, it will accelerate the translation of oHSV
therapy into an efficient and improved treatment modality for the patients with BCBM."
10802748,"Abstract
Our understanding of DNA replication and its relationship with chromatin structure, nuclear organization
and gene transcription has advanced significantly through the development of genome-wide assays. Most
genome-wide tools to study DNA replication utilize large populations of cells and report on the average
behavior of the population; as such, many infrequent or stochastic events that occur as the replication fork
progresses through chromatin are missed. Recently, we have developed novel methods to map DNA
replication with single-molecule and single-nucleotide precision. In this proposal we will apply this new
technology to understand how DNA synthesis can be completed when the replication machinery
encounters obstacles. We will specifically test how RNA/DNA hybrids and G-quadruplex DNA influence
the progression of DNA replication and whether DNA synthesis can be efficiently restarted downstream of
an impediment. In addition to understanding the progression of replication through chromatin, we will also
investigate how replication is competed during the process of termination. Using high-resolution assays,
we have uncovered a critical role for the DNA helicase Rrm3 in replication termination. We will further
define the role played by Rrm3 and test a novel hypothesis that Rrm3 may prevent catastrophic re-
replication of the genome."
10802861,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurodevelopmental disorders are a serious health problem affecting more than 3% of children worldwide.
More than 1,000 genetic variants in synaptic proteins are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. While the symptoms of these disorders differ, each of
them affects transmission between synapses in the brain, altering how information is passed throughout the
neural network. To understand what causes these disorders and how to treat them, researchers are striving to
learn the mechanism behind how these genetic variations affect synaptic function at the cellular and molecular
level. This study aims to help answer foundational questions about synaptic transmission using the emerging
framework of macromolecular assemblies.
Transmitting information efficiently from one synapse to another requires transcellular nanocolumns (TNCs).
TNCs span the synaptic cleft and align the neurotransmitter release site of one neuron with the receptors on a
neighboring neuron. Unfortunately, the arrangement of components within these TNCs remains unclear. This
makes it challenging to determine whether disease-causing mutations disrupt functional TNC formation. This
proposal employs an innovative, multidisciplinary approach that combines cutting-edge cryogenic electron
tomography (cryo-ET), biochemical methods, mass spectrometry, cell imaging and electrophysiological
recordings to generate a nanoscale, macromolecular blueprint of synaptic transmission. Our central hypothesis
is that synaptic proteins form subsynaptic PSD nanoblocks, receptor nanodomains and cleft adhesion
molecule pairs as key building components for TNC alignment and activity dependent re-organization, which is
critical for regulating synaptic transmission and plasticity. Toward proving this hypothesis, the authors have
already used cryo-ET on cultured primary neurons, induced human neurons, and isolated nerve terminals to
directly visualize the nanoscale organization of TNCs in near native state. These efforts have provided the first
molecular-resolution information on such TNC assemblies. Advancing from that success, we will utilize two
independent yet complementary aims to establish the sub-10 nm resolution structure of TNCs in healthy
physiology and diseases: (1) investigate the molecular architecture, composition, and assembly of postsynaptic
nanoblocks, (2) determine the in situ structures of synaptic adhesion molecular pairs and glutamate receptors,
then investigate their organization within the synaptic cleft and their alignment with PSD nanoblocks. This
research will significantly advance scientific understanding of the molecular architecture, dynamics, and
functions of synaptic nanostructures, particularly TNCs. This knowledge will enable development of new
therapeutics that target nanoscale structures."
10803117,"Project Summary:
 The fungus Candida albicans is a frequent commensal of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract but is also an
important cause of both mucosal and systemic disease. The GI population is particularly relevant to human
health as cells can translocate out of this niche to cause disseminated infections. C. albicans cells in the gut
also play key roles in regulating local and systemic immune responses that can be either beneficial or
detrimental to the host. There is therefore a pressing need to understand how C. albicans colonizes the GI
tract and to define how changes to the commensal environment impact fungal behavior.
 Attention has focused on the ability of C. albicans to transition between yeast and filamentous states,
with yeast-locked cells shown to exhibit higher fitness in the GI tract than wildtype cells. However, these
studies have extensively relied on models that require antibiotic supplementation for stable fungal
colonization. In preliminary studies, we examined C. albicans fitness in colonization models without antibiotic
treatment. Surprisingly, we show that yeast-locked cells are defective for gut colonization in hosts containing
high bacterial loads, including those colonized with defined bacterial consortia. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that Candidalysin, the first toxin identified in a human fungal pathogen, is critical for gut colonization in hosts
carrying high bacteria loads but not in those given antibiotics, indicating that this factor supports fungal
commensalism by enabling competition with the bacterial microbiota.
 To build on these observations, we will examine how C. albicans morphology (and co-regulated genes)
determine GI colonization fitness. Experiments will utilize a variety of murine GI models carrying native or
defined bacterial populations to determine how interkingdom interactions influence fungal gut commensalism
(Aim 1). We are particularly interested in determining how Candidalysin regulates fungal fitness in the GI
niche, and whether this toxin acts intrinsically on fungal cells, to inhibit bacterial cells, or via its impact on host
epithelial cells (Aim 2). Experiments will also perform fitness selection assays to identify novel factors that
determine gut colonization fitness in hosts carrying different gut bacterial populations (Aim 3).
 Together, these experiments will provide novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms used by C.
albicans to colonize the gut, including the role of Candidalysin toxin in increasing the fitness of fungal cells in
the competitive GI niche. Given the importance of gut colonization to fungal-host interactions, these
experiments are critical for understanding how C. albicans operates as a human pathobiont."

 The long-term objective of this proposal is to improve the prognosis of patients with colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM). Only 15% of these patients are candidates for surgical resection due to the number, size,
and location of their liver metastases. Even for resection candidates, survival rates remain dismal. Improved
approaches are desperately needed to treat this devastating and increasingly prevalent disease.
 It has been recognized that anaerobic bacteria can proliferate only in the hypoxic regions of solid tumors
subsequently lysing tumor cells resulting in marked de-bulking and often complete regression. The failure of
chemotherapies for a broad range of tumor etiologies, including CRLM, has led to a rejuvenated interest in the
development of bacteriolytic approaches for the treatment of solid tumors.
 Most recently, the modified anaerobe Clostridium novyi-NT was identified as an ideal strain for bacteriolytic
therapy. Pre-clinical animal model studies have demonstrated the striking potential of C. novyi-NT to eradicate
solid tumors. Recent clinical trials have investigated these bacteriolytic approaches for the treatment of
patients with a broad range of tumor etiologies. Initial results from these studies have been highly promising.
However, these studies have also identified critical questions that must be addressed to maximize the efficacy
of bacteriolytic approaches, particularly for the treatment of CRLM:
 1) Systemic intra-venous (IV) dosing of C. novyi-NT spores can produce positive responses but the residual
tumor tissues in normoxic area, associated toxicities with low targeting efficacy and requirement for extended
regimen of antibiotics post-therapy may be problematic. For CRLM, selective liver-directed transcatheter
intra-arterial (IA) administration should be feasible. Furthermore, given the preferential arterial blood supply
of CRLM, hypoxia and selective anaerobe germination could conceivably be enhanced via follow-up
infusion of embolic materials to block blood flow to these metastases. The salient combination of the latter
approaches we have now dubbed `transarterial bacteriolytic embolization' (TBE).
 2) Obligate anaerobe C. novyi-NT spores germinate in only hypoxic regions and destroy tumor cells via
secretion of lipases and proteases. Accurate delivery of C. novyi-NT spores to these hypoxic regions and
subsequent tumor colonization will be critical to achieve positive outcomes. Imaging the dynamic
distribution of C. novyi-NT spores and germinated anaerobes (transcatheter IA delivery to the tumors
and subsequent colonization in tumor) should critically permit a) intra-procedural optimization during
targeted administration and b) early prediction of longitudinal outcomes.
 Through this collaborative project building upon our inter-disciplinary strengths in nano/bio interfaces,
nanomedicine, interventional oncology, and radiology, we seek to develop a new nano-functionalized cyborg C.
novyi-NT and powerful new approach for image-guided trans-arterial bacteriolytic therapy."
10798165,"Sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias is a major public health problem, accounting for 10-20%
of all deaths in adults in the US. Current predictors can identify patient subsets at high risk, but unfortunately
sudden death is the first manifestation of heart disease in up to half the victims. Costly implantable defibrillators
in high-risk patients are the only real therapeutic option at present. Conventional anti-arrhythmic drug therapy
targeting membrane ion channels has either no survival benefit or even increases mortality. Thus, a key
challenge in the arrhythmia field is to understand fundamental mechanisms in order to find better ways to
predict and treat ventricular arrhythmias. Since the pharmaceutical industry has all but abandoned drug
development for cardiac arrhythmia, in 2018 there are fewer antiarrhythmic agents available for clinical use
than 20 years ago. Hence, another key challenge for academia is to improve the efficacy of existing
antiarrhythmic drugs and find new compounds that could be developed therapeutically.
The overall vision of my R35 research program is to better understand molecular and cellular mechanisms
responsible for arrhythmia and to use this knowledge to improve the care of patients with arrhythmia disorders.
To accomplish this vision, the proposed research program will build on our prior accomplishments (e.g, finding
new treatments for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or developing human induced
pluripotent stem cells as better tools for arrhythmia research) to pioneer discovery in three areas: (1)
Discovery of new arrhythmia mechanisms; (2) Discovery of new antiarrhythmic treatments; and (3)
Development of new approaches to individualize care of patients with arrhythmia disorders.
Accomplishing these goals will provide major conceptual advances for our understanding of the
pathophysiology and treatment of acquired and inherited arrhythmia syndromes."
10795350,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During the last two decades, nearly half a million people died each year from heat-related causes; climate
change is expected to exacerbate the burden of adverse health outcomes. Heat stress has been associated
with an increase in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease and mortality, chronic respiratory disease, lower
respiratory infection, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and poor mental health.
In this RO1, we propose to determine personal heat stress of low-income individuals who do not have
access to air conditioning, evaluate the effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and scalability of
building-level cooling strategies to reduce indoor heat stress among vulnerable individuals, and
evaluate the impact of these interventions on heart rate. A disproportionate burden of heat-related death
and disease is borne by low-income communities because they do not have access to cooling and suffer from
comorbidities that exacerbate the adverse impacts of heat stress. South Asia faces the greatest current and
predicted loss in disability-adjusted life years due to heat stress, and heat stress is particularly strong in
informal settlements. As such, we plan to conduct this study in informal settlements in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Our
overall hypothesis is that individuals who live in homes with corrugated iron roofs and walls are at elevated risk
of heat stress and that it is possible to modify homes to prevent increases in heart rate associated with heat
stress, ultimately reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Aim 1 will characterize personal heat stress
in individuals across age ranges, occupations, sex, and housing types, and examine heterogeneity in the effect
of existing building variation on heat stress. Aim 2 will model building-level interventions, test their ability to
cool indoor spaces, and evaluate their impact on heart rate in a randomized-controlled trial. In Phase 1, energy
modeling will be used to evaluate the cooling potential of 12 passive or active building-level infrastructure
modifications, material additions, and technologies to identify six strategies with maximum effectiveness for
households in informal, low-income settlements in Dhaka, Bangladesh. In Phase 2, we will implement each of
the six strategies in 17 homes to experimentally assess their impact on indoor thermal conditions and
determine their feasibility and acceptability. The two most cost-effective interventions will be tested in a
randomized controlled trial in 459 houses in Phase 3. Phase 3 will evaluate the impact of the interventions on
residents’ heart rate (primary outcome), blood pressure, self-reported thermal comfort, wellness, productivity,
fatigue, and indoor thermal conditions (secondary outcomes)."

Over 100,000 patients in the US currently await solid organ transplantation, with inadequate organs to save
these patients from waitlist mortality. Safely expanding the donor pool, and optimally matching donors to the
right recipient, is essential to transplantation. The overarching goal of the applicant is to guide clinical decision-
making and policy in solid organ transplantation, particularly in the context of novel expansions such as HIV-
infected donors and recipients, expanded criteria for living donation, and immunological incompatibility.
 This is a renewal proposal for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award for Dorry Segev, MD, PhD, a transplant
surgeon and epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University who has published 422 papers and received 4 NIH
R01 and 2 NIH U01 awards in his 12 years on faculty. The first 5 years of this K24 provided the protected time
that Dr. Segev needed to mentor 11 residents, 16 medical students, 5 graduate students, and 14 junior faculty
in an exciting, productive multidisciplinary environment; these mentees wrote 141 first-authored papers under
Dr. Segev’s direct mentorship, and received 31 NIH/AHRQ grants and 13 foundation grants. This renewal will
leverage carefully designed cohorts and data-driven tools that Dr. Segev has generated through NIH-funded
studies, including (1) a linkage of national transplant donor and recipient registry data to insurance and
pharmacy claims; (2) a longitudinal multicenter study of over 5500 living kidney donors; (3) multicenter study of
long-term outcomes and survival benefit from incompatible live donor kidney transplantation, with granular HLA
and antibody data on over 2000 recipients and their donors; and (4) a prospective multicenter study of frailty,
health literacy, cognitive dysfunction, biomarkers, and other novel risk predictors, with over 5000 kidney
transplant and 2000 liver transplant patients. In addition, this renewal will leverage two new U01-funded
studies of HIV-to-HIV kidney and liver transplantation, including measurement of HIV-related complications,
characterization of HIV-related kidney disease, measurement of HIV superinfection, and examination of the
size and genetic composition of the latently infected HIV proviral population.
 These national data and large multicenter cohort studies provide rich substrate for ancillary studies by
mentees, as well as many opportunities for advanced methodologic training. Specifically, the new aims of this
K24 are: (1) to better understand survival benefit in HIV+ patients undergoing liver transplantation, using a
novel linkage to identify patients with HIV on the LT waitlist by prescription fills of medications specific to HIV
treatment; (2) to characterize long-term post-donation eGFR trajectories and associations with subsequent
outcomes in living kidney donors; (3) to identify the appropriate treatment for sensitized patients in the recent
era of deceased donor allocation and kidney exchange; and (4) to expand Dr. Segev’s capacity to mentor the
next generation of clinician-scientists in solid organ transplantation."
10798335,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) surpassed HIV as the number one cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. In
the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of TB cases in the nation, comprising nearly
one-quarter of all new active TB cases in 2017. More than 80% of active TB disease in the U.S. is due to
reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LTBI. Yet, adoption of the latent TB
screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely
on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further,
treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LTBI and the barriers to successful treatment
are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record
data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LTBI
stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for
LTBI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being
perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LTBI stratified by characteristics of
interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of TB cases prevented by current screening as a
measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For
Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LTBI based on variables widely
available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify
risk factors for positive LTBI tests and reactivation TB. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and
will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To
estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will
develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation and
completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients
and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will
perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment
completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S.
LTBI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this
work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions
to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LTBI care continuum."

PI: Bennett Van Houten, PhD
Abstract/Summary
This highly innovative project seeks to answer several fundamental questions regarding how DNA
repair proteins work to protect the human genome from environmentally-induced DNA damage. This
project uses an integrated approach combining biochemistry, single molecule analysis and highly
innovative chemoptogenetic cell biology tools to study with high temporal and spatial resolution
molecular hand-offs during DNA repair. We posit that key nucleotide excision repair proteins including
UV-DDB, XPA, and XPC-RAD23B work in a dynamic way with specific base excision repair proteins to
process oxidized bases in the context of chromatin. Specially, we will follow purified DNA repair
proteins and/or proteins labeled from nuclear extracts as they interact at sites of damage on naked
DNA and chromatinized DNA using a DNA tightrope optical platform. Building on preliminary data and
premise that UV-DDB can change the register of specific lesions in the context of the nucleosome, we
will test the paradigm shifting hypothesis that UV-DDB working in concert with other NER proteins is a
general damage sensor and can stimulate APE1 and 11 mammalian DNA glycosylases activities on
their respective oxidized DNA substrates. This project will develop and validate new genomic tools to
place 8-oxoG adducts at defined sites throughout the genome to assess the how chromatin structure
and chromatin remodelers effects repair. We will also develop and use several high-resolution
fluorescent approaches including single particle tracking protocols (based on Halo- and SNAP-tags) to
watch individual repair proteins arrive and process damage sites in real-time in living cells. Finally, we
posit that UV-DDB and XPC-RAD23B work with thymine DNA glycosylase to alter methylation patterns
in cells and ultimately change gene expression profiles. Together these approaches will give an
unprecedented view of the complex process of DNA damage processing during repair and answer
several key questions regarding damage recognition that have been intractable in the absence of
super-resolution approaches. Completion of this project will have a long and lasting impact on the field."
10798341,"Abstract:
The goal of this study is to understand the role of the gut microbiome in the development of neuropsychological
symptoms (NPS) among patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) through potential roles of short chain fatty
acids and inflammation among patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) receiving chemoradiotherapy.
Patients with HNC experience significant NPS, such as fatigue, depressive symptoms, cognitive dysfunction,
and sleep problems. These symptoms often occur as a cluster, influence treatment responses, predict worse
survival among HNC patients, and have a more negative impact on patient outcomes and survival than
individual symptoms. Our earlier work, along with others, have shown a robust link between peripheral
inflammation and these NPS. However, the biological factors that contribute to inflammation are still not fully
understood and the management of NPS is still challenging. An emerging appreciation of the gut-brain
connection has suggested the involvement of the gut microbiome in NPS. Microbiome dysbiosis has been
implicated in complex symptoms including fatigue, depression, cognition, sleep, and pain. Our preliminary
data indicate that taxa associated with high inflammation were associated with high NPS. Moreover, the gut
microbiome is believed to paly immunomudolatory roles, in part mediated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs),
the most abundant metabolites of bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers in the gut. SCFAs not only play key
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory roles within the gut and periphery, but also cross the blood-brain
barrier leading to decreases in neuroinflammation and improvement in brain homeostasis. Our preliminary gut
microbiome data suggest lower abundance in SCFA-producing taxa in patients with high NPS. Our pilot data
on plasma SCFAs echo this trend by showing that lower circulating butyrate, a main SCFA produced by the gut
bacteria, was associated with high NPS. These new exciting data suggest that a restoration of depleted
bacteria or their metabolites has the potential to reverse the dysbiosis-associated phenotypes. Therefore, we
propose a longitudinal study of 350 HNC patients receiving active treatment to examine the association
between the gut microbiome and NPS before and after treatment. Patients with HNC also have a high risk of
dysbiosis due to severe side effects (i.e., mucositis, dry mouth, and difficulty opening mouth) of cancer
treatment. These debilitating and long-lasting side effects reduce patients' capability for food intake, and could
result in marked changes in gut microbiome and subsequently SCFAs. Taken together, we hypothesize that
cancer treatment-induced alterations in the gut microbiota and resulting reductions in SCFAs contribute to high
peripheral inflammation and then NPS. Our results may lead to the development of NPS therapies targeting
the gut microbiome and production of SCFAs. This may also contribute to NPS management among other
cancer patients, given the high prevalence of NPS in a variety of cancer papulations."
10806996,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:
The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) has significantly improved outcomes for patients with a
variety of malignancies. By blocking the inhibitory signaling pathways of T cells, CPIs are associated with a
diverse spectrum of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Immune-related cutaneous adverse events (ircAE)
are the most frequent AE and may result in CPI dose interruption or discontinuation. Current guidelines
recommend corticosteroids for the management of irAEs including those affecting skin. Yet ~25% of ircAEs are
steroid unresponsive, and their use has revealed a negative effect on survival, underscoring the need for early
identification of corticosteroid unresponsiveness and rational therapies. Although the underlying pathogenic
mechanism of irAEs remain elusive, autoimmune and autoinflammatory reactions have a putative role in their
development and maintenance. Thus, understanding the pathogenic events underlying irAEs are critical to their
prevention and treatment. The underlying mechanisms of irAEs remain a significant knowledge gap that we will
address in this proposal. Our Central Hypothesis is that patients with ircAEs have unique endotypes
associated with polarized immune responses in the skin and blood, which results in corticosteroid responsive
and unresponsiveness reactions that may require intervention with targeted immune pathway blockade. In
addition, we hypothesize that specific ircAE skin manifestations are associated with unique immune dermatologic
responses. Cutaneous irAEs give us a unique opportunity to understand the immune reaction in the involved
end organ and systemically. We will test our central hypothesis through;
Aim 1: Define and correlate ircAE phenotypes with their immune reaction endotype and response to toxicity-
directed therapy. In this aim we hypothesize that ircAEs are associated with distinct, polarized immune
endotypes that correlate with specific cutaneous phenotypes and predict response to available interventions
(corticosteroids, biologics targeting inflammatory pathways).
Aim 2: Identify skin and circulating lipid biomarkers which occur during and after ircAEs. This aim tests the
hypothesis that distinct ircAE clinical phenotypes and their endotypes will manifest unique changes in the skin
structural and circulatory signaling lipidome and suggest novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate ircAEs.
Aim 3: Determine mechanisms associated with corticosteroid unresponsiveness in patients with ircAE. This aim
tests the hypothesis that steroid unresponsiveness can be defined by understanding the major mechanistic
pathways involved, and ultimately allow targeted therapy to resolve the ircAE.
In this translational approach to understanding ircAEs, our goal is to define in patients, the mechanisms involved
in ircAEs, activated polarized pathways, and advance our understanding of translational immunology as well as
lead to actionable interventions to mitigate these devastating AEs that can limit cancer therapy."

Climate change is a well-documented reality that is impacting planet earth and its inhabitants. The health impacts
of climate change have been studied in terms of heat wave, air pollution, spread of vectors of infectious diseases,
and extreme weather events of flooding, drought, wildfires, as well as mental illnesses. One of the regions that
will be impacted most from climate change is the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Yet, there is very limited
understanding of the human health impacts, the possible policies and interventions to address them, and most
importantly limited capacity in research of such policies and interventions. Through this proposal we will establish
the GeoHealth Hub for Climate Change Health Impacts in MENA through its two components: The U01 research
component (1/2 GeoHealth Hub for Climate Change and Health in the Middle East and North Africa-
Jordan) and the U2R training component. The research and training will take place in Jordan, Lebanon, and
Morocco. The climate relevant areas of research will focus on heat waves, precipitation and water quality, air
pollution, and desert dust pollution. Cost-effectiveness analyses of environmental health policies will be
determined to quantify health benefits from interventions through economic models and then informing local
governments through dissemination and implementation science. These will be linked to the U2R GeoHealth
Hub training application titled “2/2 GeoHealth Hub for Climate Change and Health in the Middle East and
North Africa-U.S. The training program will focus on creating a cadre of local experts in one or more of the
areas of environmental health in the scope of the U01. The U2R training will build on the ongoing R25 training
grant between the two collaborating academic institutions in Jordan (Jordan University of Science and
Technology-JUST) and the U.S. (University of California San Diego) (2R25TW010026-06A1). We have
assembled an exceptional team of collaborators from the top institutions led by the University of California San
Diego and with UC Berkeley, and Harvard University, as well as support of the U.S. CDC. This will be
complemented by partnership in the MENA represented by the Jordan University of Science and Technology in
Jordan, University of Balamand in Lebanon, Mohamed VI University for Health Sciences in Morocco, and the
WHO Regional Eastern Mediterranean Center for Environmental Health Action located in Amman, Jordan. The
training program will include short term didactics in the form of summer courses, workshops, U.S visits, and
virtual webinars to build individual capacity building. We will build institutional capacity through the addition of

research training on work related to the U01 aims. We will also aim to influence overall awareness about climate
change health impacts among the general health and policy professional community through an annual regional
conference to showcase the hub. This will be a sustainable state-of-art hub to inform policy makers about the
health risks of climate change and the first of its kind to fill in a major gap in this region."
11179721,"Abstract
Climate change is a well-documented reality that is impacting planet earth and its inhabitants. The health impacts
of climate change have been studied in terms of heat wave, air pollution, spread of vectors of infectious diseases,
and extreme weather events of flooding, drought, wildfires, as well as mental illnesses. One of the regions that
will be impacted most from climate change is the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Yet, there is very limited
understanding of the human health impacts, the possible policies and interventions to address them, and most
importantly limited capacity in research of such policies and interventions. Through this proposal we will establish
the GeoHealth Hub for Climate Change Health Impacts in MENA through its two components: The U01 research
component (1/2 GeoHealth Hub for Climate Change and Health in the Middle East and North Africa-
Jordan) and the U2R training component. The research and training will take place in Jordan, Lebanon, and
Morocco. The climate relevant areas of research will focus on heat waves, precipitation and water quality, air
pollution, and desert dust pollution. Cost-effectiveness analyses of environmental health policies will be
determined to quantify health benefits from interventions through economic models and then informing local
governments through dissemination and implementation science. These will be linked to the U2R GeoHealth
Hub training application titled “2/2 GeoHealth Hub for Climate Change and Health in the Middle East and
North Africa-U.S. The training program will focus on creating a cadre of local experts in one or more of the
areas of environmental health in the scope of the U01. The U2R training will build on the ongoing R25 training
grant between the two collaborating academic institutions in Jordan (Jordan University of Science and
Technology-JUST) and the U.S. (University of California San Diego) (2R25TW010026-06A1). We have
assembled an exceptional team of collaborators from the top institutions led by the University of California San
Diego and with UC Berkeley, and Harvard University, as well as support of the U.S. CDC. This will be
complemented by partnership in the MENA represented by the Jordan University of Science and Technology in
Jordan, University of Balamand in Lebanon, Mohamed VI University for Health Sciences in Morocco, and the
WHO Regional Eastern Mediterranean Center for Environmental Health Action located in Amman, Jordan. The
training program will include short term didactics in the form of summer courses, workshops, U.S visits, and
virtual webinars to build individual capacity building. We will build institutional capacity through the addition of
tracks in environmental health to existing masters and PhD programs. We will also have mentored one-on-one
research training on work related to the U01 aims. We will also aim to influence overall awareness about climate
change health impacts among the general health and policy professional community through an annual regional
conference to showcase the hub. This will be a sustainable state-of-art hub to inform policy makers about the
health risks of climate change and the first of its kind to fill in a major gap in this region."
10806999,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The prevalence and significance of methylation reactions in biology is well established. Methyl groups are
appended to a wide array of biological molecules, including numerous small-molecule metabolites and natural
products, and various macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA, RNA, carbohydrates, and lipids. In the vast
majority of methylation reactions, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the source of the appended methyl group. In
classical methyltransferase reactions, strong nucleophiles such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur attack the sp3-
hybridized methyl group of SAM in a polar SN2 reaction, affording S-adenosylhomocysteine as a co-product.
Carbon atoms can also be methylated by this mechanism, but only if a suitably nucleophilic carbanion can be
generated. Relatively recently, it has come to light that SAM can be used to methylate inert carbon or
phosphinate phosphorous atoms via pathways involving radical intermediates. These noncanonical SAM-
dependent methylations are found in numerous biosynthetic pathways for antibiotic, antifungal, anticancer,
and herbicidal natural products, and are catalyzed exclusively by enzymes within the radical S-
adenosylmethionine superfamily. Radical SAM methylases currently consist of three classes (Class A, Class B,
and Class C) based on structural architecture, cofactor requirement, and mechanism of action. Class A
enzymes use a Cys dyad to catalyze methylation of sp2-hybridized carbon centers. Class B enzymes use
cobalamin cofactors to catalyze methylation of both sp2- and sp3-hybridized carbon centers. Class C enzymes
use two simultaneously bound molecules of SAM to methylate sp2-hybridized carbon centers. In all cases, the
appended methyl group derives from a second molecule of SAM. This work will continue our efforts to
understand how these radical SAM methylases work, with a particular focus on efforts to determine structures
of these enzymes with bound substrates, cofactors, and intermediates. Important systems include RNA
methylases that are involved in antibiotic resistance, as well as methylases that are involved in the biosynthesis
of important antibiotics, such as thiostrepton A, nosiheptide, and carbapenems, the antibiotics currently of last
resort."
10807001,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Olefins are abundant chemical feedstocks that many industries, including pharmaceutical development, rely
on to prepare essential synthons in a stereo- and regioselective manner. Similar to the ubiquity of olefins, sulfur-
containing molecules have been used in a medicinal context since antiquity, and continue to represent a large
portion of new FDA approvals. The ability of sulfur to adopt five stable oxidation states further contributes to the
structural diversity predicated on forming crucial C–S bonds. As such, the development of a chemo- and
enantioselective method to construct C–S bonds (i.e., thioethers) from olefins would serve as a useful synthetic
tool in the preparation of many pharmaceutically relevant targets.
 While many methods exist to prepare thioethers, they classically rely on the nucleophilic addition of thiolates
to highly reactive species such as alkyl halides. This approach has poor chemo-selectivity, in that uncontrolled
nucleophilic addition can occur at many sites within complex architectures, and has stereoselectivity that is
predicated on first forming enantiopure alkyl halides. These two factors greatly limit the general utility of this
approach and often dictate the order in which bonds must be constructed in targeted synthesis. Over the last
decade, thiol-ene chemistry has emerged as a useful tool in constructing C–S bonds from olefins. However,
thiol-ene chemistry proceeds with restricted regioselectivity, in that it only allows anti-Markovnikov
functionalizations, and does not yield enantioenriched products.
 The object of this proposal is to provide a new synthetic approach to synthesize enantioenriched thioethers
from widely available functionalized olefin precursors. Using copper(I) hydride catalysis in conjunction with a
sulfenamide-based sulfur transfer reagent will yield a versatile method to construct both enantioenriched and
linear thioethers. Furthermore, the prepared thioethers will serve as an entry point to other stereodefined sulfur-
containing functional groups such as sulfoxides and sulfones. This versatile method will be beneficially adopted
to the synthesis of many sulfur-containing pharmaceuticals, thereby demonstrating the overall utility of this
approach. The proposed research is expected to provide novel approaches to tackle long-standing challenges
in forging C–S bonds using CuH catalysis.
 The Buchwald laboratory at MIT is the ideal environment to accomplish the proposed research and training
goals in preparation for a career in academia. In the Buchwald group, I will gain crucial training in many areas of
organic chemistry including method development and physical organic chemistry. Furthermore, MIT will provide
numerous opportunities to improve my skills as an educator and scientific mentor through the MIT Teaching and
Learning Laboratory. Collectively, all of these factors led me to choose MIT as the optimal institution to pursue
my ultimate goal of having a successful independent academic career."
10807982,"Abstract
Children of Latino migrant farm workers (LMFW) are a unique and vulnerable population whom are at
significant risk for social and health disparities that can have lasting developmental and socioeconomic
consequences. Every year over 3 million migrant and seasonal farmworkers harvest food across the United
States, and almost 60% have minor children whom often accompany them. Mobility produces unique
challenges for children including educational interruptions and instability, discrimination, isolation, and poverty
which can contribute to poor mental and physical health as well as early substance use. These challenges may
be especially salient during adolescence when high-risk behaviors and health disparities become more
evident. Due to the high mobility of these families, few researchers have studied this population with
consideration of the longitudinal nature of migration, and thus, have been unable to identify the long-term
effects of migration status on youth health outcomes. Also, researchers have rarely assessed resilience factors
that may mitigate stressors that LMFW youth experience. Our objectives are to longitudinally examine how
contextual migratory stressors contribute to proximal vulnerabilities that result in poor health outcomes for
LMFW youth during adolescence. We also assess specific protective factors that have potential to buffer
children from migratory risks, as well as promote health and well-being. Study participants include 400 LMFW
children aged 10-15 recruited in all three regions of the Migrant Education Program in Indiana. We use
a longitudinal mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative semi-structured interviews with quantitative
surveys collected from multiple reporters, biomarkers, and behavioral tasks to address 3 specific aims: (1)
Assess how macro and proximal risks are associated with salient health outcomes in LMFW youth, and identify
how mobility status moderates these relations; (2) Examine how macro level stressors and mobility status
affect LMFW youths’ health trajectories across adolescence, and assess how such links are mediated by
proximal risk factors; and (3) Identify protective factors that counteract or buffer negative health trajectories in
LMFW youth. This project uses a dynamic multi-disciplinary approach to assess the long-term developmental
consequences of mobility on health, while utilizing a strength-based framework to elucidate meaningful
individual, familial, and community resilience factors present in LMFW children’s environment. These outcomes
are expected to have a significant positive impact on public health issues relating to LMFW children by
informing policy and directing future intervention efforts targeted at reducing health disparities in a vulnerable
youth population during a critical developmental period. By focusing on the children of migrant farmworkers,
whom constitute one of the most economically disadvantaged and underserved Latino subpopulations, our
study lays the groundwork for future studies that aim to develop interventions to improve the life chances,
health, and adjustment of second-generation immigrant children in farmworker families."
10807983,"Maternal stress and diet, and the fetal epigenome
Abstract
In children, a cluster of metabolic dysfunction including truncal obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia are
increasing in prevalence, disproportionately affect minority populations, and increase the risk for adverse long-
term outcomes. While genetic factors underlie some of this increase, these conditions also have a large
environmental component. Among suspected environmental contributors are prenatal stressors including
maternal depression and anxiety and chronic stress associated with adverse childhood experiences; the underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood. One way in which genes and the in utero environment can interact to
trigger the initiation of disease is through epigenetic modifications. In fact, environmental exposures like social
stress can cause detectable long-term changes in pathways that contribute to appetite and satiety, nutrient
acquisition, metabolism, and fat deposition. However, the regions of the epigenome that are targeted by these
stressors remains unclear, primarily because available genome-scale array data are measured in DNA derived
from accessible tissues, such as blood—but epigenetic marks vary widely by cell type, and the measured cell
types may not be relevant to metabolic dysfunction. The exception is parent-of origin cytosine methylation marks
that control genomic imprinting, known as imprint control regions (ICRs). Methylation of these regions is
established early, before tissue specification, and therefore is similar across tissues. Aberrant methylation of ICRs
detectable in peripheral blood is implicated in numerous metabolic diseases, making ICRs promising targets for
investigations of metabolic diseases. Until recently, only 24 ICRs were known, limiting the scope of these
investigations. Our group recently identified the complete repertoire of DNA methylation marks that control
genomic imprinting; here, we seek to leverage these ICRs to identify methylation patterns associated with
metabolic dysfunction in children. We will test the hypothesis that prenatal stress substantially increases the risk
of cardiometabolic dysfunction among children, and that detectable epigenetic perturbations at ICRs mediate
these associations. We also will evaluate the extent to which anti-inflammatory diets such as the Mediterranean-
style diet modify these effects. We will leverage data and biological samples from our existing cohort resources
of the Newborn Epigenetics Study and Stress and Health In Pregnancy, where more than 750 women and their
children have been followed from 3 months gestation, and children now range in age from 2 to 15 years. We will
test the hypothesis that a Mediterranean-style diet prenatally, mitigates health effects of prenatal stress via
epigenetic mechanisms. This will provide much-needed data on the epigenetic fingerprint linking social stressors
to the cluster of metabolic outcomes in children, paving the way for clinical trials focused on dietary manipulation
to mitigate the effects of a wide variety of prenatal exposures."
10804789,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) afflict ~8% of Americans and ruptured AAA carries >80% mortality.
Screening programs have increased identification of small AAA, but there is no directed medical therapy to inhibit
growth and rupture rates have not decreased. The technologic advances in endovascular AAA repair have been
vast while our ability to correlate pathology to clinical care has lagged. There is a clear need for a platform to
incorporate patient-specific mechanobiologic stressors to complement aortic diameter measurements and inform
treatment decisions. Inhibition of two mechanical signaling molecules, the AngiotensinII-type 1 receptor (AT1R)
and the serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase-1 (SGK-1), has been explored in pre-clinical experimentation
and hold promise for clinical application. In mice treated with the AT1R blocker Losartan or SGK-1 inhibitor
EMD638683, AAA growth was abrogated and only ~25% aortic dilation was observed, suggesting that there was
a non-mechanical contribution to this early matrix remodeling. Additionally, since both inhibitors led to the same
degree of aortic remodeling, it has raised the question of whether AT1R and SGK-1 operate interdependent
mechanical signaling cascades. Interest in SGK-1 as a druggable target in small AAA was amplified when it was
discovered that upregulated SGK-1 activity promoted VSMC pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis, while SGK-1
inhibition restored VSMC contractile function as quantified by ultrasound-derived pulse propagation velocity
(PPV). Therefore, SGK-1 is a prime candidate to transduce aortic mechanical strain to promote VSMC synthetic
activity in AAA growth. We propose that VSMC synthetic phenotypes evolve during AAA growth based on
mechanical activation of SGK-1 and that the plasma levels of well-documented AAA biomarkers represent an
opportunity to define these transitions. Specific biomarkers assessed in this project incorporate inflammatory
cytokines (Interleukin-6, IL-6), protease systems (Matrix metalloproteinse-9, MMP-9; CathepsinS, CtsS;
CystatinC, CysC), markers of calcification (Osteoprotegerin, OPG), and fibrillar matrix peptides (TenascinC,
TNC). Integrating these pathologic matrix markers (PMMs) with ultrasound-derived mechanical aortic strain and
immunohistochemical analysis may enable prediction of aortic wall instability. We hypothesize that increased
aortic stiffness can mechanically activate SGK-1 to alter VSMC synthetic activity to promote PMM production,
aortic matrilysis, and AAA growth. In Aim 1, stimulation with axial tension will confirm upregulated SGK-1 activity
in murine abdominal aortic rings. Dependence of PMM expression on SGK-1 activity will be explored by blocking
with EMD638683 versus Losartan. Data will be computationally integrated to explore additional pathways
engaged in tension-induced VSMC synthetic activity. In Aim 2, mice will undergo AAA induction with peri-
adventitial application of CaCl2. Ultrasound-derived aortic strain parameters include quantification of global radial
strain, distensibility, and pulse propagation velocity. Assessment of aortic strain parameters, plasma PMMs, and
SGK-1 activity will occur at days 0, 7, 21, and 42. Integrity of matrix components as well as the quantification
and localization of inflammatory infiltrate and VSMC phenotypes will be completed utilizing the Hyperion Imaging
Mass Cytometry. To demonstrate the integral role of SGK-1 in PMM production, aortic wall inflammation, and
VSMC synthetic phenotype, a subset of animals will have EMD638683 versus Losartan therapy initiated at day
21. Computational modeling will integrate aortic strain parameters, PMMs, and SGK-1 activity to define
synergistic relationships that can be further interrogated. In Aim 3, patients with normal aorta versus small AAA
will have plasma PMMs and ultrasound-derived aortic strain collected annually over 3 years. Computational
assessment of this data will further support the concept that these easily accessible biomechanical indicators
can be utilized to predict aortic growth. Integrating mechanical stressors with PMMs may enhance the analysis
of aortic wall pathobiology during growth of small AAA to expedite identification of druggable targets and the
characteristics of patients who would benefit from that therapy."
10805608,"Older Veterans suicide rates are 1.7 times greater than the general population of the same age and they have
a higher prevalence of depression. Moreover, older adults with depression are more likely to have impairments
in functioning across multiple health and social domains than their civilian counterparts. Depression later in life
is related to premature death, and impaired physical, cognitive and social functioning. Specifically, older
Veterans with depression tend to disengage and withdraw from social engagements, which interferes with
maintaining and creating interpersonal relationships and subsequent positive externalities (e.g., mood-
enhancing benefits or social activity). Further, this social withdrawal impedes the protective health effects
gained through frequent positive social contact with the same individuals (i.e., social support). Currently, there
are few models for community-based social support once individuals separate from military service. However,
VOICES Veterans Socials is a peer-led weekly social group based in the community designed to promote
sustainable social support among Veterans. The proposed SPiRE will involve three aims: 1) Adapting training
and intervention materials for VOICES Veterans Socials to serve older Veterans with depression through
individual interviews (n= 13) with older Veterans with depression, and regular meetings with an expert advisory
panel; 2) Conducting an open trial (n = 20) with a focus on feasibility (e.g., fidelity, retention and acceptability)
over the four-month intervention that includes pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up assessments and
interviews; and 3) Completing final revisions of the adapted VOICES Veterans Social manual for a future grant
application, dissemination, and randomized clinical trial. This pilot project is significant and innovative in three
key respects: (1) it extends services into the community based on previous research to address both
psychiatric and social concerns for Veterans with depression; (2) is potentially cost-effective and easy to
disseminate nationally, as there are over 85 transdiagnostic versions of VOICES Veterans Socials in the U.S.;
and (3) focuses on improving older Veterans’ social functioning and mental health differently than current VA
offerings. Results from this pilot project will inform the development of a Merit Review application for a
randomized clinical trial."
10805764,"The Problem: Mesothelioma is a devastating cancer where the majority of patients will die from their disease.
The last significant advance in treatment for mesothelioma was the introduction of immunotherapy, which was
approved by the FDA in 2020. However, the benefits of current systemic therapeutic approaches to mesothelioma
are modest and not curative. New treatments are needed.
Knowledge to be Addressed: The long-term goal of this laboratory is to identify key principles of cancer
biology that will allow the appropriate selection of the most effective combination therapies based on upfront
molecular signatures. The objective of this application as a next step in the pursuit of this long-term goal is to
validate that dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a viable target to inhibit as part of a treatment strategy
against mesothelioma. DHODH is a key (and rate-limiting) enzyme in de novo pyrimidine synthesis and has
been demonstrated to be highly expressed in several cancers, including mesothelioma.
Hypothesis: Our central hypothesis is that inhibition of DHODH will result in decreased cell proliferation in vitro
and decreased tumor growth in vivo. Secondarily, we also hypothesize that 1) combination treatment with DHODH
inhibition plus dinaciclib (inhibitor of CDKs 1, 2, 5, and 9 and 2) combination treatment with DHODH inhibition with
immune checkpoint inhibition will result in synergistic effects on cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.
Preliminary Studies: We have demonstrated that the DHODH inhibitor BAY2402234 potently inhibits
mesothelioma cell proliferation in vitro. In addition, we have demonstrated that the combination of
BAY2402334 and dinaciclib is synergistic in decreasing cell proliferation in vitro.
Specific aims: 1) Validate that inhibition of DHODH inhibits mesothelioma growth and proliferation. 2) Identify the
mechanisms of DHODH inhibition on related targetable pathways in mesothelioma to validate a drug combination
to inform the design of a near-term clinical trial.
Significance and Innovation: The proposed work is innovative because inhibition of DHODH has never been
studied in mesothelioma before. Positive results in this study will validate DHODH as a target to purse in treatment
strategies against mesothelioma. In addition, establishing a link between pyrimidine synthesis, several CDKs, and
immune checkpoint inhibition will be novel. The proposed research will de-risk future preclinical and clinical studies
and will aid in the design a clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of DHODH inhibition in the treatment of
mesothelioma."

The choice of a delivery system for genetic manipulation or gene expression remains a topic of debate in the
research community. The development of a safe, unique, and efficient delivery vehicle that could promote gene
editing would significantly contribute to the field of gene therapy and regenerative medicine. Recently, we have
demonstrated that the Measles virus can be developed as a single cycle vector for multiple gene delivery. We
have shown that we can express the four reprogramming factors from on single measles genome and reprogram
adult human fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells. We further have evidence that MeV can express the
gene-editing system CRISPR-Cas9 and lead to the correction of cells in the presence of a molecule of DNA
template. The goal of this application is to develop new prototype measles vectors that can either genetically
modify or correct a specific gene locus without relying on a DNA molecule using Prime Editors. As a proof of
concept, we will develop prototype vectors based on the vaccine strain of the measles virus, a negative-strand
RNA virus. The objectives of this application are (1) to establish the proof of principle that the MeV vector can
express the Prime Editing system (MeV-PE2). To do this, we will express the two elements required for prime
Editing: the Prime editor (PE2) and prime editor guide RNA (pegRNA), and test their functionality in producing
modified cells for the correction of Sickle cell disease (SCD) (2) In the second aim, we will introduce the latest
generation of Prime editor in MeV vector (MeV-PEmax), which consists of the PE2 and the introduction of (i) a
standard gRNA targeting the non-edited template, (ii) the MLH1dn protein to reduce mismatch repair or (iii) a
modified pegRNA to increase its stability. The proposed work is innovative, challenging, and significant, and if
successful, it will lead to the production of novel prototypes of “all-in-one” non-integrating RNA viral vectors for
cellular gene editing without the addition of an exogenous molecule of DNA. This work will open the future
development of safe vectors for gene editing and the production of corrected cells for multiple genetic disorders.
This new platform will have a significant impact in the field of gene therapy and regenerative medicine."
10812425,"Due to the aging of the United States population, age-related cognitive problems resulting from Alzheimer’s
disease and other causes of dementia are increasingly prevalent. Before individuals are diagnosed with
dementia, they typically exhibit a period of “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI). Mild cognitive problems
associated with MCI frequently impact an individual’s ability to perform everyday tasks, including working,
independent living, and medication adherence. Veterans are at increased risk of cognitive decline, and the
Veterans Healthcare Administration (VA) is now providing health care to surging numbers of older Veterans
with MCI who report significant cognitive complaints, difficulties with everyday functioning, and concerns about
impending dementia. Despite high patient demand, few cognitive rehabilitation interventions exist that
specifically address the needs of older Veterans with MCI that are widely accessible, patient-centered, and
evidence-based. To our knowledge, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted that evaluate the
efficacy of manualized, brief and inexpensive, yet comprehensive (multi-modal) cognitive rehabilitation
interventions for older Veterans with MCI. Hence, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy
of Motivationally Enhanced Compensatory Cognitive Training (ME-CCT), a manualized cognitive rehabilitation
group treatment for older Veterans with MCI. The study’s specific aims are to determine whether ME-CCT is
effective for: 1) improving objective cognitive performance and functional capacity, 2) improving subjective
cognitive complaints, subjective functioning, and collateral measures of everyday function, and 3) increasing
modifiable protective factors (e.g., diet, exercise) associated with reduced risk for MCI. We will also explore
mediators and moderators of treatment effects. The overall goal is to evaluate a manualized group treatment
for the symptoms of MCI that can be readily implemented in VA treatment settings. The study design makes
use of the convergent availability of resources at the two participating VA Healthcare Systems in San Diego,
California and Portland, Oregon to conduct a randomized controlled trial of ME-CCT. The study will recruit a
sample of 216 Veterans (108 at each site) who meet criteria for MCI. Inclusion criteria will be: 1) Veterans 55
years old or older enrolled at one of the participating VAs who are able to provide informed consent, 2)
Independently living, 3) Meet criteria for MCI based on previously published criteria (Petersen, 2004; Petersen,
2011), and 4) Willingness to participate in audio-recorded group sessions. Exclusion criteria will be: 1) Current
substance use disorder with less than 30 days abstinence, 2) History of schizophrenia, schizoaffective
disorder, or other primary psychotic disorder, 3) History of significant head trauma with loss of consciousness
>30 minutes, and 4) Auditory or visual impairments that would prevent ability to participate in the cognitive
rehabilitation group. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either the ME-CCT or an active control
group, Goal-focused Supportive Contact (SC). The SC group will provide the same frequency and amount of
therapist and peer contact as ME-CCT, but without specific training in cognitive strategies, lifestyle strategies,
or motivational enhancement. 10 2-hour long weekly sessions will be delivered in both conditions. Both groups
will undergo evaluations at baseline, 5 weeks (midway through the intervention), 10 weeks (immediately
following the end of the intervention), and 23 weeks (3 months after completion of the intervention)."
10812437,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases are a growing concern worldwide, as the consequences
are often lethal, or at best they leave patients incapacitated. One such disease is dystonia, which
overwhelms affected people with severe motor difficulties including painful muscle over-contractions,
twisting of the body and tremor in the limbs. Despite recent efforts in identifying the brain circuits that
contribute to dystonia, as well as the success of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a therapy for adults,
pediatric patients face unique long-term health concerns, with poor treatment options for many kids
since the timing of disease onset is unclear. Such barriers arise as developing circuits are dynamic;
and functional changes that promote brain maturation create hurdles for using deep brain stimulation.
An overarching problem, however, is that we currently have little insight into how the brain regions
and circuits that mediate dystonia emerge during embryonic and early postnatal life. As a first step
towards better defining the developmental mechanisms that instigate dystonia, we have found that
conditional loss of a single gene, engrailed1 (En1), which is required for brain morphogenesis, results
in severe dystonia in mice. En1 and its homolog engrailed 2 (En2) are homeobox-containing genes
that cooperate to control midbrain and hindbrain development. The basal ganglia, which are partly
located in the midbrain, and the cerebellum, which is entirely located within the hindbrain, are the two
main structures that are thought to drive dystonia pathophysiology. Intriguingly, manipulations of En1
alone leave the basal ganglia intact, but alter cerebellar circuit patterning. Based on the cerebellar
focus of the En1 conditional phenotype, we argue that severe dystonia originates from genetically-
defined defects that disrupt cerebellar circuit maturation. We generated three specific aims to test this
hypothesis in vivo. In Aim1, we will use conditional genetic manipulations in combination with in vivo
electrophysiology and quantitative behavioral paradigms to uncover the temporal dependence of En1
in setting the severity of developmental dystonia. In Aim2, we will perform cell-type specific deletions
of En1 and then conduct in vivo electrophysiology in behaving pups to define the neural signatures of
the En1-dependent cerebellar circuits that trigger early-onset dystonia. Although the cerebellum and
basal ganglia are present in En1 mutants, it is unclear if their circuits are mis-wired to a point that is
beyond repair. In Aim3, we will use the En1 lineage to target optogenetic DBS to the cerebellum and
basal ganglia to test which region restores mobility in En1 mutants. Then, we will deliver optogenetic
stimulation to the En1 lineage in control mice to test which of these regions can initiate dystonia in
otherwise normal young and adult mice. Designing better treatment options for incurable motor
diseases will improve healthcare considerations and enhance the quality of life for pediatric patients."
10812439,"Project Summary
According to the CDC, there are more than 3 million people with active epilepsy in the US. It is estimated that
up to 50% of all epilepsy cases are initiated by a neurological insult and are called acquired epilepsy. Brain
infections and traumatic brain injury are two major examples of common brain injuries that can lead to the
development of acquired epilepsy. Although there is diversity in the etiology and the severity of the disorder,
understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which seizures develop will aid in uncovering novel
ways to prevent epilepsy following high-risk CNS injuries.
Evidence has accumulated indicating that glial cells play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of
the prolonged neuroplasticity changes underlying the development of epilepsy. NG2-glia are commonly known
as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). However, a growing body of evidence has led to their classification
as a major glial cell-type in their own right. Recent evidence suggests that these cells play important roles in
maintaining environmental homeostasis, and disruptions to NG2-glia function have now been highly implicated
in the development and progression of neurologic disease.
To investigate whether NG2-glia are involved in epilepsy development, in Aim 1, NG2-glia morphology, structural
organization, and protein expression were evaluated in a viral infection-induced mouse model of acquired
epilepsy. The analysis identified that NG2-glia have highly reactive morphology, increased proliferation, and are
involved in scar formation both during viral infection and following viral clearance. These NG2-glia responses
are also highly localized to the hippocampus, the site of active infection and the origin site of seizures. This is
significant because, while likely triggered by the initiating infection, the NG2-glia reaction may continue to play
an important role in long-term neuroplasticity deficits that lead to epilepsy.
Preliminary experiments in Aim 2 demonstrate that extracellular purines (damage signals that are heavily
produced in the hippocampus following viral infection) induce robust elevations in intracellular calcium in NG2-
glia. This finding is important because calcium can be used as a functional readout to better understand the real-
time dynamics and the environmental signals initiating the NG2-glia reaction to injury and infection. Future work
aims to use calcium signaling as a functional readout combined with morphological changes to better understand
the intracellular and intercellular communication that occurs between glial cells during injury and disease. This
study is the first to analyze calcium signaling in NG2-glia during infection and epilepsy development, and may
lead to novel cellular and molecular targets to restore homeostasis and prevent the development of epilepsy
following a high-risk insult to the central nervous system."
10812410,"Project Summary / Abstract
This application is in response to a specific request for proposals to develop immune cell engineering towards
the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). We propose to evaluate genetic engineering approaches in immune T
regulatory cells (Treg) by integrating chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) proteins that are engineered with an
external targeting domain (scFv) and internal stimulatory domain. This approach has revolutionized cancer cell
therapy with heightened specificity and effectiveness of T cell action. We and others have found evidence that
CAR Treg can help mediate immune protection of islets and may even act upon islets themselves to reduce
stress and cell death. We propose to (a) determine how enhanced targeting and activation of Treg to human
islets might improve islet function and local immune modulation to protect islets, (b) evaluate a method for
enhanced islet targeting through the development and testing of a dual-targeting CAR system that exploits
downstream T cell receptor signaling molecules that have not been previously evaluated and (c) determine
how enhanced targeting and activation of Treg to human monocytes might result in more immunoregulatory
monocytes that could help to alter response to islet autoantigens and prevent immune destruction. One very
important component of our proposal is that we suspect that CAR Treg from patients with T1D may not
function as well as CAR Treg from normal individuals. In fact, there is no data about this available. We think
that some CAR Treg from some T1D patients might be more cytotoxic, less effective or more inflammatory and
we propose to evaluate if this is true statistically and also to develop an approach to introduce and overexpress
a set of genes known to be important for Treg function as a way of making sure that all Treg in all cases will
exert effects that are wanted. We postulate that developing these Treg methods will produce novel clinical

10812414,"Bioactive lipids, such as ceramide and its downstream metabolites, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate
(S1P), mediate critical biologic responses, including inflammation and cancer1. Thus, the enzymes regulating
lipid metabolism are intriguing therapeutic targets. The long-term goal of this project is to define the role of the
bioactive sphingolipid metabolizing enzyme, acid ceramidase (AC), in colitis and colitis-associated cancer (CAC)
and determine whether targeting this enzyme could serve as a novel anti-inflammatory/anti-CAC therapy.
 The PI’s laboratory has an established track record of expertise in sphingolipid metabolism and function2,3.
Our recent work has begun to uncover a specific and very unique role for myeloid (Mye) AC in colitis and CAC.
Using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS-induced CAC in murine
models, we found that AC expression is increased in the inflammatory infiltrate but not in the colon epithelium.
Similarly, we observed increased AC expresion in tissue macrophages in humans with colitis and colon cancer.
In conditional knockout mice deletion of AC in myeloid cells, (Mye AC cKO), but not intestinal epithelial cells,
decreased immune infiltrate and protected mice from colitis and CAC. Moreover, we found that our AC-specific
inhibitor, LCL521, attenuates inflammation in a chronic colitis model (IL10 deficient mice). Finally, our newest
preliminary data using bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Mye AC cKO mice strongly hint that
Mye AC may be required for inflammatory responses in these cells. Together these data suggest that Mye AC
plays a large role the development of colitis and CAC.
 Based on our substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that loss of Mye AC activity is protective against
colitis and CAC by modulating colonic inflammatory infiltrate, and that targeting Mye AC may result in novel
disease-modifying therapy in colitis and CAC. This hypothesis will be tested by the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1. Establish that Mye AC cKO protects from chronic colitis and CAC in vivo.
Specific Aim 2. Determine the mechanisms by which loss of Mye AC protects from chronic colitis in vivo
and probe these mechanisms in cells.
Specific Aim 3. Advance pharmacologic inhibition of AC as a novel colitis and CAC target.
The significance of these studies lies in the unique role of AC as the ceramidase that is clearly important in colitis
and CAC, and the potential for AC as a novel therapeutic target. Identifying the mechanisms by which AC
regulates chronic colitis and CAC, with specific focus on Mye AC, is a crucial first step in the design of novel
therapies targeting this pathway. In addition, the studies that target AC in specific mouse models of colitis and
CAC, will allow us to begin to translate our studies into clinical therapeutic approaches in the very near future."
10813142,"Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the cornerstone for brain tumor diagnosis and
treatment planning. While its sensitivity for metastases is superior to that of CT or PET-CT, small lesions (<5-
mm) and leptomeningeal spread may still be missed, which can have a major impact on prognosis and
planning for stereotactic radiosurgery, as well as on the use of targeted biologics that cross the blood-brain
barrier. A method that could further improve the sensitivity and specificity of MRI for brain tumors would be of
great clinical benefit. Towards this end, we have developed a new class of pulse sequences, called T1
Relaxation-Enhanced Steady-State (T1RESS), that greatly improves the visibility of tumors in contrast-
enhanced MRI. Compared with existing neuroimaging techniques, T1RESS at least doubles the tumor-to-
background contrast while significantly improving the tumor-to-background contrast-to-noise ratio. An
“unbalanced” version (uT1RESS) renders blood vessel dark and is the focus of our proposal.
 In a preliminary study of 54 adult patients that was published in Science Advances, uT1RESS provided
a remarkable twofold or greater improvement in tumor-to-brain contrast along with a marked improvement in
lesion-to-brain contrast-to-noise in comparison to standard-of-care MPRAGE and other pulse sequences that
are commonly used to image brain tumors. We found that even small metastatic tumor deposits and
leptomeningeal lesions that were difficult to distinguish from small blood vessels with standard imaging
techniques could be unambiguously identified.
 The primary hypothesis of this five-year grant proposal is that T1RESS will significantly improve the
sensitivity for small brain metastases compared with existing MRI pulse sequences, while also reducing scan
times. A secondary hypothesis is that the twofold improvement in tumor-to-brain contrast obtained with
uT1RESS can be used to enable a substantial twofold reduction in gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)
dosage. Studies of phantoms, healthy volunteers, and patients with brain tumors along with Bloch equation
modeling will be used to guide sequence optimization. These optimization efforts will be followed by a two-
institution study to determine the accuracy of the technique. Our specific aims are as follows:
1. To apply uT1RESS in healthy subjects and patients with brain tumors to systematically evaluate the impact
of various sequence parameters on image appearance, contrast, SNR, and lesion sharpness, and to optimize
the technique to maximize tumor visibility while minimizing scan time and image artifacts.
2. To perform a pilot study to determine whether metrics of tumor visibility using uT1RESS and a twofold
reduced GBCA contrast agent dosage are noninferior to MPRAGE with a standard contrast agent dosage.
3. To perform a two-site research trial at 3T to characterize the appearance of brain metastases with
uT1RESS, and to determine its accuracy for small brain metastases compared to standard-of-care MPRAGE."
10813144,"Abstract
Protein aggregation is a hallmark of at least 71 diseases. Protein aggregates are caused by an imbalance in
protein homeostasis resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins. One major question in biomedical
research is: How do cells recognize and deal with misfolded proteins? My laboratory has taken a unique
approach to answering this question. Instead of studying protein aggregation in model organisms where proteins
readily aggregate, we have identified Dictyostelium discoideum (Dictyostelium) as a proteostatic outlier, highly
resistant to protein aggregation. Using this unique feature of Dictyostelium we are working to identify how nature
has dealt with the problem of protein aggregation. Once we determine the mechanisms Dictyostelium utilize to
suppress protein aggregation we plan to determine if this information can be used to develop therapeutic
strategies. In the next five years our goal is to have a comprehensive analysis of factors that suppress protein
aggregation in Dictyostelium. Factors that suppress protein aggregation in Dictyostelium will then be tested to
determine if they can be used to treat human diseases caused by protein aggregation. In addition to our work
on identifying how Dictyostelium evades protein aggregation we are also interested in what biological role
pathways that suppress protein aggregation play in Dictyostelium biology. One particular area of interest is in
Dictyostelium’s developmental cycle where single cellular amoeba transition to multicellular fruiting body. This
developmental cycle is of interest because the initial gene that we identified as a suppressor of protein
aggregation is part of a large gene family found only in Dictyostelium discoideum and Dictyostelium purpureum,
two closely related organisms that undergo this developmental process. This gene family is developmentally
regulated with most genes being transcribed in short bursts at time points during and after Dictyostelium
becomes multicellular. In the coming years we want to understand what role this protein family plays in
Dictyostelium development to determine if suppression of protein aggregation plays a critical role in Dictyostelium
development."
10784931,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tight regulation of circulating nutrients within a narrow physiological range is a critical function of metabolism,
and eating is a regular perturbation of this homeostasis. Growing evidence suggests that changes in circulating
metabolites after a standardized mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) may reflect underlying cardiometabolic
(CM) health beyond what is revealed during fasting. Thus far, there have been very few broad
characterizations of metabolomic changes after a standardized meal in a large cohort of community-dwelling
individuals with a range of CM risk. In recently published human data, the applicant identified >30 circulating
metabolites whose 2-hour changes after a MMTT are different in people with diabetes vs. those without even
after accounting for fasting differences. A subset of these metabolites is associated with premature death in a
large population-based cohort. The applicant will now extend these pilot findings in the Framingham Heart
Study (FHS), where >2,400 participants will undergo a MMTT and metabolomic profiling of ≈800 targeted
metabolites and ≈5,000 unknown compounds by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We will
test whether specific metabolites’ responses after a MMTT are associated with a range of CM risk factors such
as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, obesity, and unhealthy diet, and novel glycemic traits by continuous
glucose monitoring (Aim 1). We will then assess broader epidemiologic implications of these post-MMTT
metabolite responses by examining their associations with incident cardiometabolic disease (CMD) in the FHS,
relating their fasting levels to incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in racially and ethnically
diverse external cohorts, and testing whether post-MMTT metabolite responses may be causally related to
CMD by leveraging genetics (Aim 2). Finally, we will translate the paradigm of using a MMTT to assess CM
health from individuals in the community with average CM risk to a hospital-based cohort of individuals with
overt CMD (i.e., heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]). We will assess whether post-MMTT
metabolite responses are related to markers of HFpEF disease status and if post-MMTT metabolite responses
improve after treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, which are theorized to improve
outcomes in HFpEF through metabolic modulation (Aim 3). The applicant is an early career investigator and
cardiologist with a research focus on leveraging evolving biochemical profiling techniques in precision nutrition
to improve CVD prevention and treatment. This proposal will further the applicant’s career development
through training in nutrition science, state-of-the-art metabolomics technology, advanced biostatistics and
bioinformatics methods for analyzing metabolomics and genomics data, and the conduct of patient-oriented
research in diverse settings. The applicant’s outstanding mentoring team of senior investigators with
distinguished mentoring records and internationally recognized expertise in nutrition, metabolomics, genetics,
and epidemiology will support the candidate as he transitions to research independence during the award."
10785528,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite progress in human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake, about three million women are still
diagnosed with precancerous cervical lesions each year in the US. Most spontaneously regress, but yearly follow
up and invasive prophylactic care (e.g., endocervical curettage and cervical biopsy) is still required as it is not
clear which may progress to cervical cancer. Since Black women have more persistent HPV infections and
precancerous lesions, as well as a higher incidence of cervical cancer than white women, they are
disproportionately impacted by these invasive prophylactic procedures and their sequelae (e.g., pain, bleeding,
scarring, infertility, future miscarriages, and preterm births). The vaginal microbiome (VMB) has been implicated
in sustaining HPV infection and development of precancerous lesions. HPV-positive women, women with
precancerous lesions, and Black women are more likely to have a suboptimal VMB with high taxonomic diversity
with depletion of Lactobacillus spp. (both features of vaginal inflammation and dysbiosis) and are also associated
with worse prognosis for precancerous lesions. My preliminary data shows that an optimal, Lactobacillus
predominant VMB is protective against the risk of a precancerous cervical lesion for white but not Black women.
Since the VMB is susceptible to the host micro and macro environments, it is plausible that these differences
override the protective effect of the VMB in Black women. At the micro level, differences in species-specific
metabolic profiles might be contributing to lesion prognosis by disturbing vaginal homeostasis. At the macro
level, psychological stress, which is disproportionately experienced by Black women may be influencing the VMB
through a cortisol pathway which has been biologically implicated with VMB dynamics and known to be
dysregulated in Black women in response to stress. In this K01 application, I will test the hypothesis that racial
differences in daily experiences of stress and respective cortisol response result in VMB changes that influence
differential precancerous lesion regression by race. I will measure VMB changes and psychological (ecological
momentary assessments), and physiological stress (salivary cortisol) among 75 Black and 75 White women
diagnosed with a cervical lesion, assessed during the critical time between their routine pap screen and abnormal
follow-up. The proposed mentorship, training and research will give me critical skills in bioinformatics, statistical
and molecular biology to interrogate plausible mechanisms through which the VMB might underlie racially
differential etiologies for pre-cancerous cervical lesions. The training described in this proposal will prepare me
to become an independent translational investigator leading to the identification of practical solutions to the
reduction of cancer outcome disparities."
10813874,"This application focuses on expanding toolbox for control tsetse fly by formulating eco-friendly novel odor
attractant and repellent blends against major tsetse vectors of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and
African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) in eastern Africa. Eastern Africa is under continuous risk of
rhodesiense HAT and AAT transmitted by different tsetse species, including Glossina austeni (Gau),
Glossina pallidipes(Gpd), and Glossina fuscipes fuscipes (Gff). Tsetse control strategies constitute
cornerstones efforts in suppression and eradication of HAT and AAT that can be augmented by effective 1)
tsetse lures that attract the flies to traps or insecticide-treated targets, and 2) repellents that minimize contact
between flies and their vertebrate hosts. We formulated Novel Attractant Blend (NAB) (ε-nonalactone,
nonanoic acid, 2-nonanone and acetone) from waterbuck and buffalo odors that is 1) two- and five-folds
more effective against Gau and Gpd, respectively, than POCA (3-propylphenol, octenol, p-cresol and
acetone) standard tsetse attractant, 2) 2.4 folds more attractive to Gpd than Fermented Cow Urine (FCU) +
acetone (proxy for natural bovine host odor), and 3) seven-fold more attractive to Gpd than POCA when co-
deployed with FCU and acetone. We are interested in comparing the performance of NAB with that of natural
hosts (cattle) on Gpd and identify other host odor constituents that may enhance the attraction of NAB. There
are no effective attractants against Gff while POCA and NAB are suboptimal against Gau, relative to Gpd.
We confirmed attraction of Gff by monitor lizard (Varanus niloticus niloticus) and established role of olfaction
in the attraction. Gau preferentially feed on bush pig (Potamochoerus larvatus). We are interested in
formulating Gff and Gau repellents from monitor lizard and bushpig hosts and integrating their application
with NAB for efficacy against multiple (sympatric) species. We also established repellence of Gau by
FCU+Acetone and formulated Novel Repellent Blend (NRB) (δ-nonalactone, heptanoic acid, 4-
methylguaiacol and geranyl acetone) based on tsetse-refractory waterbuck odor that is effective against most
savannah species and two-fold more efficacious than current WRC-icipe blend against these species. We
are interested in formulating Gau specific repellents from FCU constituents, evaluate its synergistic effects
on NRB through co-deployment and assess efficacy of NRB and Gau repellent in protection of vertebrates,
from tsetse, with oxen and domestic pig as proxy. We will extend the efficacy and application of the
repellent/attractant blends by masking them with fragrance and micro encapsulating them in nano-particles.
We will thus formulate 1) Gff and Gau specific attractants and integrate them with NAB for control of sympatric
tsetse populations and 2) Gau repellent and integrate it with NRB and NAB for protection of vertebrate hosts
from sympatric tsetse in Kenya as consortium comprising of Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research
Organization and Kenya Wildlife Services in Kenya , and Yale University in USA."

The Research Education Component (REC) of the proposed University of Pennsylvania Patient-Oriented
Research and Training to Accelerate Learning (Penn PORTAL) program will train learning health system (LHS)
Scientists to develop and test patient-centered health care innovations aimed at improving health care delivery
and population health. This training will center equity and justice while incorporating approaches from
comparative effectiveness research, implementation science, behavioral science, biomedical informatics,
quality and safety operations, and ethics. Scientists will learn how to evaluate and implement evidence,
generate actionable and trustworthy findings from patient data, partner with health system and community
stakeholders, and conduct pragmatic trials. Penn PORTAL’s REC will build on the successes of the Penn T-
GAPP K12 program while addressing the needs of a diverse emerging LHS Scientist workforce. Specifically,
we aim to train a diverse cadre of LHS Scientists whose careers fit into one of two phenotypes: LHS Scientist
Investigators seeking independently funded research careers and LHS Scientist Clinician Leaders seeking
targeted skill building in LHS science. Scientists will be supported by a mentoring team including research and
operations experts and by consultants in equity and community engagement and in research design and data
analysis. They will develop knowledge and skills corresponding to the AHRQ LHS competencies through
didactic training (an LHS Seminar Series with lectures and interactive discussion sessions and a 4-day
implementation science bootcamp) and experiential training (a series of LHS Design Studios and a capstone
project). Additional coursework tailored to the Scientists’ phenotype will be selected by the Scientist and their
mentoring team guided by the Scientist’s Individual Development Plan. A third type of trainee, LHS Affiliate
Scholars, are early-stage faculty and clinician leaders who will be recruited from the Philadelphia metro area to
participate in the LHS Seminar Series and the LHS Design Studios. Affiliate Scholars will be recruited from
local health systems through the Accelerate Health Equity initiative, a unique city-wide collaboration funded by
the city’s major payor and including all major Philadelphia health systems. Penn PORTAL will be rigorously
evaluated using a logic model and serial assessments of learners, mentors, and health system outcomes.
Penn PORTAL is poised for success and high impact because it leverages Penn’s institutional strengths,
including existing educational programs in health care innovation, quality and safety, health equity and justice,
biomedical informatics, implementation science, behavioral economics, and ethics; several robust and linked
LHS research and training centers; and a world-class roster of 49 mentors spanning medicine, nursing, health
services research, and clinical operations. The long-term result of these efforts will be exceptional LHS
Scientists and Affiliate Scholars who are equipped to execute rigorous LHS projects and advance the field of

PROJECT SUMMARY
The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) Patient-Oriented Research and Training to Accelerate Learning
(Penn PORTAL) includes an Administrative Core, Research Education Core (REC), Research & Data
Analysis Core (RDAC), and Equity & Community Engagement (ECE) unit. The goal of the RDAC is to
centralize, expand, and support the people, processes, methods, and technical resources necessary to
keep Penn’s learning health system (LHS) research-ready – that is, able to identify high-priority
questions, rapidly design and test potential solutions, measure patient-centered outcomes using
comparative effectiveness methods, disseminate results to key stakeholders, and foster implementation.
These goals will be achieved by uniting the multidisciplinary expertise at Penn essential to executing
LHS studies, using this expertise to design and complete LHS studies, and deploying state-of-the-art
methods to build, curate, and disseminate accessible data resources and knowledge. The RDAC will be
co-led by Drs. Kevin Johnson and Michael Harhay. Dr. Johnson has led the development and
implementation of clinical information systems and clinical decision support to drive LHS research for
over 20 years, and as Vice President for Applied Informatics for Penn’s health system, he is uniquely
positioned to support the RDAC’s activities. Dr. Harhay is a biostatistician and epidemiologist with
extensive experience in designing and analyzing LHS projects, particularly pragmatic and cluster trials.
In addition to supporting the broader REC and PORTAL training and research activities, the RDAC will
accomplish three major endeavors. First, they will establish and lead the ‘Penn LHS studio’ that will
bring together senior LHS stakeholders, including clinical operations and informatics leaders, with the
RDAC leads and PORTAL MPIs for monthly meetings where the priority, feasibility, and ongoing needs
of LHS proposals and projects will be assessed to ensure the expediency and success of new and
ongoing projects (Aim 1). Second, they will develop a multidisciplinary PCOR/CER study design and
analysis service to support the entire lifecycle of LHS projects and educate LHS Scientists. This service
will include fourteen faculty with expertise spanning study design, advanced statistical methods,
implementation science, health care operations and systems science, community engagement, and the
ethics of human subjects research, particularly for pragmatic trials (Aim 2). Third, the RDAC will build,
standardize, curate, and disseminate essential and unique data assets and knowledge to catalyze LHS
science. Current and planned projects include developing tools to capture social determinants of health,
producing an online catalog of LHS solutions that have been tested and implemented (over 75+
interventions implemented and 400+ publications to date), protocolizing data extraction algorithms, and
collating all discrete and free-text patient data to support multiple research and operations needs rapidly."

The development of the thyroid gland from anterior endoderm is an essential step in development that allows for
the production of thyroid hormones around week 12 in utero in humans. Unfortunately, in about 1/4000 births
genetic mutations that affect this development pathway lead to congenital hypothyroidism requiring lifelong
thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Thus, a better understanding of thyroid follicular cell development could
lead to a process where genetic editing and cellular therapy could provide treatment for congenital
hypothyroidism (CH). Our work in this area has utilized a directed differentiation approach and has identified
bone morphogenic protein and fibroblast growth factor as key mediators of thyroid follicular cell lineage
development across species resulting in functional murine thyroid follicular cells that can rescue athyreotic mice.
In this proposal, we now turn our attention exclusively to human thyroid follicular cell development and propose
three Specific Aims that will allow for the pre-clinical development of functioning human thyroid follicular cells
derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), In the first Aim we will utilize a novel lineage tracing
methodology to understand how developing human thyroid follicular acquire their cell fate and to ensure that the
process in iPSC parallels that in vivo. In the second Aim we will prove that the human thyroid follicular cells
derived from iPSCs are fully able to produce thyroid hormones in vitro and can be transplanted into
immunodeficient athyreotic mice to rescue their hypothyroidism. Finally, in the third Aim we will demonstrate pre-
clinically that derived iPSCs from a patient with CH can be genetically corrected and re-introduced via transplant
to function normally. Together completion of these Aims will provide key insight into the possibilities of iPSC
derived cellular therapy for the treatment of CH and enhance our understanding of the development endodermal-
derived tissues in humans."
10801240,"This is a competing renewal application of an ongoing merit review program, focused on the mechanisms
of leukemogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The program aims to develop innovative new therapeutic
approaches for AML by identifying new cellular targets in leukemic cells. This is of high clinical translational
significance and relevance, as the outcome for most patients with AML remains very poor. Resistance of
leukemia cells continues to be a serious problem and identifying pathways that can be therapeutically targeted
is of high importance. Work from our laboratory has provided evidence for the existence of negative feedback
regulatory loops in AML cells that are engaged in response to antileukemia drugs and mediate leukemic cell
resistance. These include activation of pathways that regulate transcription and mRNA translation of pro-
leukemogenic genes, and other regulatory negative feedback loops.
 In efforts to identify pathways associated with leukemic cell resistance, we discovered that there is
constitutive activation of the ULK1 kinase in AML cells and identified novel phosphorylation sites that may
mediate autophagy-independent activation of downstream effector pathways. Remarkably, we found evidence
for interactions of ULK1 with proteins key in the pathophysiology of AML. These include RUNX1 and other core
binding factor proteins and CHAF1b & CHAF1a. These unexpected findings raise the intriguing hypothesis that
ULK1 directly regulates transcription factors that are important for leukemogenesis and play key roles in the
pathophysiology of AML. The current proposal is a systematic approach to define the mechanisms by which
ULK1 is engaged in leukemogenesis. The proposal aims to use such information towards identifying novel
cellular targets in AML for the development of new therapeutic approaches. Specific aim 1 will define
autophagy independent ULK1 effector pathways and will dissect their roles in leukemogenesis. Studies will be
performed to examine the roles of unique ULK1 phosphorylation sites in the activation of downstream
effectors, including RUNX1, CBFβ and the Core Binding Factor (CBF) complex. The requirement of ULK1 in
the regulation of CHAF1b and CHAF1a in leukemogenesis will be assessed, and the functional role of the
ULK1-S6K complex in mRNA translation and ribosome function in AML cells will be defined. Specific Aim 2 will
determine the role of ULK1 and effector pathways in antileukemic responses in AML models in vivo. AML
models will be established using ULK1 conditional knockout mice and AML patient-derived xenografts. The
impact of ULK1, as well as ULK1 effector pathways in leukemogenesis and generation of antileukemic
responses by hypomethylating agents and chemotherapeutic agents will be examined. Specific aim 3 will
examine the antileukemic properties of novel ULK1 inhibitors on primary leukemic progenitors from AML
patients. It will systematically study the effects of ULK1 inhibitors on primary cells from AML patients and will
define their effects on leukemic cell survival. We will also examine activation of negative feedback regulatory
loops and will determine whether combinations of ULK1 inhibitors and modulators of such feedback loops
result in enhanced antileukemic responses.
 Together, these studies should advance our understanding of the mechanisms of AML leukemogenesis
and provide the basis for important future clinical-translational efforts involving the use of novel drugs targeting
ULK1 or its effectors for the treatment of AML."

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a complex disorder and developed as an adverse consequence of
excessive alcohol use. It is a major public health problem among veterans and a leading cause of chronic liver
diseases and liver transplantation in the US. Mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM) are the site
where mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) form contact points; it is a signaling hub enriched with a
wide range of proteins. One of its crucial functions is to regulate Ca2+ transport from the ER to mitochondria to
support mitochondrial metabolism. In the MAM, Ca2+ transfer is regulated by a formation of MAM Ca2+-
channeling complex, consisting of the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75). GRP75 acts as a
tether between ER and mitochondria by physically binding with ER membrane Ca2+ efflux channel, Inositol-1-
tri-phosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1), and outer mitochondrial membrane protein, Voltage-dependent anion
channel 1 (VDAC1). The role of MAM in ALD pathogenesis has not been explored. We found that hepatic
pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), one of the MAM-associated genes, was significantly upregulated in
ethanol-fed mice and patients with ALD. Our overarching goal is to further understand the mechanistic action
of the PDK4 and the MAM axis in mediating alcohol-induced liver injury. In the first aim, we will determine the
effect of hepatic PDK4 and MAM Ca2+-channeling complex formation in alcohol-associated liver disease.
Subsequently, in the second aim, we proposed a mechanistic study to determine the molecular mechanism of
PDK4 on MAM Ca2+-channeling complex proteins in the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver disease. This
is based on our novel preliminary data that PDK4 modulates the MCC complex via the phosphorylation of
GRP75. In the last aim, we proposed several translational experiments to determine if PDK4 deficiency
ameliorates ethanol-induced liver injury via suppression of the MAM formation. Taken together, we have
developed a mechanistic proposal to determine the role of PDK4 and MAM in ALD pathogenesis. Our
proposed experiments also open an avenue for the future therapy of ALD by employing PDK4 as its target;
illustrating the clinical applicability of our project."
10801146,"Abstract: HPV positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV+ OPSCC) comprises a progressively
rising epidemic that will be a public health problem for several decades both because of the persistently low
adoption of the vaccine in the United States and the delay from HPV infection to the development of malignancy.
For this disease, treatment paradigms have been successful for some patients but are both highly morbid and
limited by the need to identify patients at increased risk of treatment failure. We believe that developing an
improved understanding of interactions between HPV and the host tumor genome will help resolve this problem,
but until now the technical approaches needed to study viral-host interactions remain limited. Recently, we
developed a novel targeted capture sequencing (TCS)-based HPV integration caller and assembler. Through
analysis of a pilot cohort of tumors and models profiled with matched TCS, long read genome sequencing and
transcriptome sequencing, we show our approach has a higher sensitivity and specificity than two other
published approaches. Unexpectedly, this analysis uncovered additional preliminary data suggesting that
multiple unique structural mechanisms drive HPV integration, and that the structural mechanism of HPV
integration may have utility in predicting the impact on chromatin accessibility and transcription of integration
adjacent genes. Further, by using our technology to evaluate multiple spatial locations within individual HPV+
tumors, we also develop pilot data suggesting that HPV integration structures are spatially heterogeneous, and
that clonal outgrowth of specific “driver” integrations may be a key feature of tumor progression. Now, by
leveraging our new technology and biospecimen resources, we propose to test the hypothesis that the
structure of an HPV integration event determines the impact on local chromatin accessibility as well as
adjacent transcript expression and structure, such that key structural features can be used to identify
functionally pivotal integration events as “drivers” of HPV+ OPSCC. We propose the following aims: 1) To
determine the accuracy of using local sequence features from short read technologies (TCS and ATAC) as a
surrogate for the structural mechanism of HPV integration in recurrent HPV+ OPSCC, 2) To define structural
features of HPV integration events critical for regulating the expression, and structure of adjacent host and viral-
host fusion transcripts in recurrent HPV+ OPSCC, 3) To identify functionally pivotal driver integration structures
through analysis of clonally enriched integrations in HPV+ OPSCCs with poor outcome. Our primary goal is to
improve the overall survival of patients with HPV+ OPSCC, while reducing treatment-related morbidity. Our
immediate objective is to advance the basic knowledge of HPV+ OPSCC tumor genetics, such that in the future
HPV integration structures may be used to help understand treatment outcomes and/or to guide treatment
decisions."

Detection of disease progression as well as evaluation of therapeutical interventions are important in the
management of many neurological disorders. Metabolic alterations such as altered glucose metabolism often
play a crucial role in conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and brain tumors. Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) is commonly used to monitor neurological diseases due to its high sensitivity and
excellent soft tissue image contrast. However, MRI has very limited capabilities to image active tissue
metabolism. MR spectroscopic methods such as 1H, 13C, hyperpolarized 13C and 31P MR spectroscopic imaging
(MRSI) are important MR research tools that can detect metabolism non-invasively in vivo. Unfortunately, none
of these methods have reached clinical significance because of technical complexity, lack of robustness and/or
low sensitivity. Deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) is a new, MR-based method that can map active metabolism
of deuterated substrates non-invasively in vivo. DMI is unique in that it is extremely robust, while providing good
sensitivity and information content, and thus has great promise to be integrated in the clinic.
 The clinical potential of DMI has sparked rapid adoption by research groups worldwide, whereby DMI
has primarily been implemented on (ultra)-high-field MR research scanners. However, such MR scanners (≥ 7T)
are only available at specialized research sites and represent only ~1% of the broadly available 3T MR scanner
base, and thus severely limit the availability of DMI. Our main goal is to assist DMI to become an accessible
method to study larger, diverse patient populations and establish its added value to neuroimaging by increasing
the spatial resolution of DMI and implement and validate the technique on a standard 3T MR scanner.
 The RF coil is one of the primary determinants of the sensitivity and overall performance of MRI and DMI.
Aim 1 is dedicated to the design, optimization and construction of a multi-element 1H/2H RF coil for high-quality
DMI and MRI of human brain. Emphasis is placed on high-sensitivity, whole-brain coverage for DMI while
retaining clinical MRI quality and acceleration potential. Aim 2 is focused on novel acquisition and processing
methods to provide robust 2H-based metabolic maps of cerebral glucose metabolism with increased sensitivity
at 3T. Improved detection sensitivity is pursued through balanced steady-state free precession and proton
decoupling. A complete processing pipeline will be developed for reproducible generation of 2H-based metabolic
maps, cumulating in a user-friendly graphical user interface. Aim 3 is centered on establishing the reproducibility
of DMI at 3T with test-retest scans on healthy subjects. Also, patients with brain tumors are studied to
demonstrate the clinical applicability of DMI. Upon successful completion, this project will deliver the hardware
(RF coil) and software (sequences, processing) necessary to achieve robust and reproducible DMI at clinical 3T
MR scanners. These technical developments will drastically improve access to DMI and drive its further
development and validation via use in larger, diverse patient populations in multi-site imaging trials."
10806192,"Project Summary/Abstract
Recent work establishes that skeletal blood vessels are not just mere channels for blood, but
instead play an active role in supporting bone formation. However, it is unknown which types of
blood vessels provide this support, how these blood vessels alter the production of bone
forming cells from their stem cell progenitors, or how this coupling between blood vessels and
bone forming cells is tied to the overall physiologic demand for bone formation. Progress in this
area has been impeded by most of the growth factors for blood vessels in bone also having
direct effects on bone forming cells, preventing their use to study interactions between blood
vessels and bone forming cells. We have recently identified a new growth factor for skeletal
blood vessels, SLIT3. SLIT3 is produced by bone forming cells and increases bone formation
not by targeting bone forming cells themselves, but instead by promoting outgrowth of blood
vessels that in turn support bone formation. Thus, SLIT3 presents an attractive tool to study
which blood vessels in bone influence bone formation and how these blood vessels shape the
production of bone forming cells. Furthermore, recent advances in understanding skeletal stem
cells from ourselves and others identify that bone contains multiple populations of stem cells
giving rise to bone forming cells, with each of these stem cells having a different anatomic
location and function. It is unlikely that a single type of blood vessel is able to support all of
these different of skeletal stem cell populations, and we accordingly hypothesize that different
types of skeletal blood vessels each support different types of skeletal stem cells. Here, SLIT3
to both address this hypothesis and establish fundamental paradigms for how endothelial cells
support bone formation. In Aim 1, we will study how SLIT3-mediated outgrowth of skeletal blood
vessels is driven by signals known to promote bone formation, determining if this SLIT3-driven
blood vessel outgrowth is needed for the bone formation response to these signals and also
which subsets of bone forming cells are the key producers of SLIT3 needed for these
responses. In Aim 2, we will determine which specific bone forming cells are supported by each
blood vessel type induced by SLIT3. In Aim 3, we will determine how SLIT3-induced blood
vessels shape the differentiation of bone forming cells. Overall, this work will provide a
foundation for the development of drugs targeting skeletal blood vessels as a new approach to
treat osteoporosis and other skeletal disorders.

10806158,"Childhood cancer survivors often have complex health needs that require medical surveillance, requiring them
to navigate the complexities of the health care system. Despite the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of
insurance, many childhood cancer survivors continue to experience underinsurance and barriers to care.
Adequate health insurance literacy is a key skill for survivors to obtain and utilize health insurance and to
prevent high out-of-pocket costs or unmet health care needs. Interventions are critically needed to support
childhood cancer survivors in addressing issues of insurance, but to date no intervention has been developed
to improve childhood survivors’ health insurance literacy. Guided by Andersen and Aday’s Behavioral Model of
Health Services Use, we developed a patient navigation intervention and health insurance booklet, targeted for
survivors. We conducted a pilot randomized trial comparing intervention, Health Insurance Navigation Tools
(HINT-S), delivered synchronously via Zoom, to enhanced usual care (EUC; digital health insurance booklet
only) among 82 survivors in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) cohort. HINT-S incorporates a
strong psychoeducational component, with 4 45-minute sessions designed to improve survivors’ conceptual
knowledge of health insurance and cost. Preliminary results support its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
efficacy. In response to RFA-CA-20-027, we propose a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to test
HINT-S vs. EUC to promote health insurance literacy, as well as improving downstream financial hardship and
health care. We will randomize 520 survivors from the CCSS cohort to: HINT-S, HINT-A (4 prerecorded,
asynchronous navigator sessions, which has the potential to be cost-effective and scalable), and EUC. All
study activities, including recruitment, data collection, and navigation, will be conducted virtually, via the CCSS
mHealth platform and patient portal. We will investigate whether HINT-S improves health insurance literacy
over EUC at 6 months (primary outcome) and explore the relative difference in effect size and cost of HINT-S
compared to HINT-A. We will explore moderators (e.g., sociodemographics, insurance status, state Medicaid
expansion status, cancer and health history, and baseline literacy) of the intervention effects. The association
of health insurance literacy with longer-term outcomes, such as financial hardship (worry, unmet healthcare
needs, and financial consequences of medical costs), decreases in out-of-pocket-costs, and improvements in
healthcare utilization at 18 months will be investigated. Implementation evaluation will assess the intervention’s
reach, engagement, acceptability, fidelity, and sustainability (including cost). This study is innovative for the 1)
comparison of digital intervention delivery, 2) focus on health insurance literacy, and 3) access to a national
sample of long-term childhood cancer survivors. Digitally-delivered interventions that address health insurance
literacy can lead to national sustainable improvements in childhood survivors’ health care costs and care."
10803197,"PROJECT SUMMARY
T2D is a major public health problem and is currently the 7th leading cause of death in the US. Despite a range
of efficacious treatments, less than 50% of patients achieve a glycemic target of A1c < 7.0%, suggesting that this
is due to difficulty with following medical regimens to reduce A1C levels. While a range of factors have been
identified in this regard, we posit that a barrier to treatment are broad difficulty with emotional regulation that are
not diagnosis-specific but lead to Diabetes Distress (DD) and difficulty in coping with medical regimens, and
other aspects of diabetes self-care, in the context of the psychosocial stressors associated with T2D. Extant data
suggests that sub-optimal emotional regulation (experience of intense emotion and skill at regulating emotion)
is related to elevated DD and A1c levels, and that an Emotion-Focused Behavioral Intervention (EFBI) can reduce
both DD and A1c levels in PWD with T2D. In this project we seek to, first, adapt our EFBI, initially developed as
a one-to-one intervention, to a group intervention (G-EFBI) and, two, collect feasibility, acceptability, and
preliminary efficacy data to determine if G-EFBI is a feasible, acceptable and, possibly, efficacious intervention
compared to an “Attentional Control” intervention in PWD with T2D and elevated DD and A1c levels."
10803198,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are severe early-onset seizure disorders with
treatment-resistant seizures, developmental delay/regression, and long-term cognitive and motor impairment.
SCN8A DEE, caused by gain-of-function, missense variants in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN8A
(Nav1.6), is characterized by infantile-onset seizures, mild to severe intellectual disability, significant
developmental delay, and elevated risk of premature lethality. A serious comorbidity in SCN8A DEE is the
prominent motor impairment, including severe hypotonia, movement disorders, and a large proportion of
individuals that are non-ambulatory. Two mouse models carrying the patient mutations p.Asn1768Asp
(N1768D) or p.Arg1872Trp (R1872W) recapitulated seizures and early death but did not exhibit motor
impairment. Thus, insight into the mechanisms underlying motor impairment in SCN8A DEE has not previously
been possible. We developed a novel conditional mouse model of SCN8A DEE with the patient mutation
p.Thr767Ile (T767I). The T767I mouse is the first model of SCN8A DEE that exhibits significant muscle
weakness and motor impairment. Our preliminary data suggests that functional motor units are reduced in
Scn8a-T767I/+ mice. We hypothesize that the Scn8a-T767I mutation alters spinal motor neuron activity,
leading to dysfunction of the motor unit and motor impairment in SCN8A DEE. Thus, we propose to use this
unique mouse model to address the gap in our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying motor
impairment in SCN8A DEE. We will use the T767I mouse to 1) determine how Scn8a-T767I affects motor unit
structure, function and connectivity, 2) determine how expression of Scn8a-T767I in motor neurons affects
neuromotor development, and 3) determine whether motor impairment can be prevented or reversed with
administration of an anti-sense oligonucleotide that reduces expression of Scn8a in brain and spinal cord.
Information gained from these studies will provide mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of SCN8A DEE
that will aid in the development of new therapeutic strategies for this severe disorder."
10803204,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In 2018, 51.8% (129 million) of American adults had at least one chronic condition (e.g., diabetes, arthritis). The
total cost of chronic conditions is $3.7 trillion; about 84% of healthcare costs are attributed to chronic condition
treatment. Self-management is critical to reducing clinical and economic burdens. Multiple sclerosis (MS)
is one of the most demanding cases, costing approximately $28 billion for about one million Americans with MS.
However, people with chronic conditions, including people with MS (PwMS), often face challenges in applying
self-care information and partnering with their clinicians over their illness progression to reflect their ever-
changing needs. Unfortunately, the existing self-management interventions and mHealth solutions for PwMS
and other patients do not support self-sustained personalization of self-management through lifelong user
modeling. To address these challenges, we propose MyMSMentor, a Health Action Process Approach (HAPA)-
driven artificial intelligence (AI) agent, to estimate users’ states and provide just-in-time guidance. Overarching
goals are: [i] developing personalized, lifelong self-management support that is contextualized in an individual’s
daily life and available resources; [ii] making MyMSMentor generalizable for the millions of people who need
lifelong self-management of other chronic conditions. The innovation of the study focuses on bridging HAPA,
social-cognitive science, and AI algorithms to build a theory-based intelligent healthcare advising agent that can
support the adoption and maintenance of health behavior. Specific Aims are: (1a) Build MyMSMentor for
proactive patient-centered self-management support; (1b) adopt participatory design to refine and evaluate
MyMSMentor iteratively; (2) validate the feasibility and acceptability of MyMSMentor with PwMS. For Aim-1a, we
will build [i] lifelong comprehensive user modeling by combining the Information Need Model, Known Information
Model, and HAPA status variables and [ii] five function modules (i.e., symptom recording and updating, case
summary generation, note-taking, user model inference module, HAPA-based interactive intervention module).
For Aim-1b, we will collaborate with patient and clinician advisory boards to co-design and evaluate MyMSMentor
iteratively. For Aim-2, 50 PwMS will use MyMSMentor for 30 days. They will use feasibility and acceptance
measures to evaluate MyMSMentor and provide user feedback. The study will make a critical and timely
contribution to establishing a generalizable novel model to bridge big data, artificial intelligence, and social-
cognitive science for precision self-management among people with chronic conditions and support the
National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System to advance data-powered research and healthcare
services."
10798277,"Acquired drug resistance (DR) largely limits the effectiveness of targeted cancer therapies, especially for
aggressive diseases, such as mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a B-cell lymphoma with poor prognosis. Recently,
FDA approved drug Venetoclax (ABT-199), a novel, potent and selective small-molecule BCL-2 inhibitor was
clinically vetted as an effective therapy for hematopoietic tumors, including MCL. The use of ABT-199
produced a dramatic response; however, the emergence of resistance to this drug was ensued by fatal
progression of the MCL. Once MCL patients relapse from ABT-199 treatment, either during or after, there is
rapid disease progression and accelerated mortality. Thus, there is an urgent need to define mechanisms of
ABT-199 resistance (AR) and identify targets to bring forward novel treatment options with tangible curative
potential. We modeled drug resistance to ABT-199 by generating AR cell lines from MCL, and characterized
the adaptive molecular reprogramming to ABT-199 treatment in these cells. Small subpopulations of lymphoma
cells were consistently detected that evade strong selective ABT-199 pressure by entering a reversible drug
tolerant 'persister' state (DTP), and consequently leading to a DTP expansion population (DTEP) and eventual
acquisition of bona fide drug resistance. Given the premise that a myriad of mechanisms are involved in MCL
AR, we applied network-wide, robust and unbiased approaches to determine the major altered MCL signaling
pathways during AR evolution. More complex and more dynamic than we had anticipated, we observed that
these DTEP cells conferred increased viability and clonogenic growth, associated with BH3 family protein
reprogramming. Intriguingly, DTEP cells can revert back to drug sensitive states after long-term passaging
without the drug, supporting the notion that these cells are epigenetically reprogrammed to drug resistant
states. Consistent with these results, our initial drug screen revealed the exquisite sensitivity to epigenetic
machinery inhibitors (e.g., BRD4, CDK7) in ABT-199 DTEP cells when compared with parental cells. In line
with this, our immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and RNA-Seq assays revealed dynamic super
enhancer (SE) remodeling in DTEP MCL cells, and this chromatin alteration is associated with CDK7-mediated
transcription in ABT-199 resistant MCL cells. We propose that transcriptional and epigenetic adaptive
responses are required for the survival of cells that persist in the presence of ABT-199 therapy. The objective
of this proposal is to strategically target transcriptional machinery and provide pre-clinical validation by
targeting CDK7/BRD4, in combination with BCL-2 as an efficient and durable treatment for MCL. With the
small molecule tools for epigenetic targets and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model available in the Qi and
Tao laboratories, respective expertise and the unique access to a large resource of primary MCL samples, the
study allows us to gain valuable insights into MCL drug resistance biology and uncover a novel mechanism-
driven therapy for MCL patients."
10798284,"Project Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a deadly disease. Although cytogenetic and molecular risk-adapted
approaches can guide treatment, overall outcomes remain poor. Currently available cell cycle-based
chemotherapy or targeted therapy, such as use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), cannot eliminate all leukemia
clones. Mounting evidence suggests that remaining cells that depend on oncoproteins for survival become a
source of relapse. Many of these oncoproteins, such as Mcl-1, STAT5, and c-Myc, are short-lived, and their high
levels in tumors are likely due to aberrant activation of the translation machinery, a hallmark of cancer. Thus,
understanding mechanisms underlying dysregulated translation is necessary to antagonize leukemia
persistence. We recently found that higher expression levels of PRMT9, the most recently defined symmetric-
dimethylarginine (SDMA)-forming enzyme, are associated with decreased overall AML patient survival. Our
proteomics and mutagenesis analysis revealed a novel mechanism whereby PRMT9 catalyzes methylation of
translation elongation factor eEF1A1, linking PRMT9 to active translation and promoting AML maintenance.
Accordingly, PRMT9 inhibition blocked AML cell survival/proliferation in an eEF1A1 methylation-dependent
manner, while sparing normal hematopoietic cells. Inhibition of PRMT9/eEF1A signaling indeed decreased
protein biosynthesis, reducing levels of the short-lived oncoproteins Mcl-1, c-Myc, and STAT5 and significantly
extending leukemic mouse survival. Thus, we hypothesize that PRMT9 is critical for AML pathogenesis and that
PRMT9-mediated eEF1A methylation promotes mRNA translation and protein synthesis to enable AML
maintenance. To test this hypothesis, we will: 1) define the function of PRMT9-mediated eEF1A arginine
methylation in AML pathogenesis using a MLL-AF9-related doubly-hit AML mouse model and a newly developed
PRMT9 conditional knockout mouse; 2) define molecular mechanisms underlying PRMT9/eEF1A signaling in
AML by testing whether eEF1A methylation alters its GTPase activity by enhancing GTP/GDP binding and
assessing whether PRMT9 deficiency induces global translation changes in AML based on ribosome profiling
sequencing; 3) determine combined effects of PRMT9 deletion or inhibition with daunorubicin/cytarabine or
AC220 treatments on AML eradication in murine and human AML models. Our studies should reveal functional
interaction between PRMT9 and eEF1A and indicate how arginine methylation of highly conserved eEF1A R166
governs translation in cancer cells. These studies will close the knowledge gap relevant to how leukemia cells
acquire a survival/growth advantage through aberrant activity of the translation machinery and may show how
combining targeting of PRMT9 with current treatments could represent a more effective strategy to eliminate
AML cells."
10808118,"The long-term goals of this proposal are to define the cellular and molecular determinants of organismal heme homeostasis. Heme, an iron-containing organic ring, functions as a vital cofactor responsible for diverse biological functions, and is the major source of bioavailable iron in the human diet. As a hydrophobic and cytotoxic cofactor, heme must be transported in a highly controlled manner through membranes via specific intra- and inter-cellular pathways. However, the genes and pathways responsible for heme trafficking remain poorly understood. The current paradigm states that cellular requirements for heme are fulfilled by the cell’s internal capacity to regulate and synthesize its own heme. Our paradigm-shifting hypothesis is that cellular heme levels are not only maintained by internal heme synthesis (cell-autonomous), but also by distally located proteins which signal systemic heme requirements to an inter-organ heme trafficking network (cell- nonautonomous). Although emerging evidence support the existence of a systemic cell-nonautonomous heme communication system in mammals, this concept has remained unexplored. Caenorhabditis elegans is a unique animal model to determine if such systemic signaling pathways exist as C. elegans allows systemic heme homeostasis to be manipulated nutritionally and genetically, and their optical transparency allows for in vivo monitoring of heme signals between tissues at subcellular resolution. In the last funding period, we identified a novel bidirectional signaling pathway of heme status between the intestine and neuron. We showed that distal organs have dedicated mechanisms to communicate and coordinate their heme status with the crucial heme storage and transport organ – the intestine via HRG-7 (cathepsin E), DBL-1 (BMP5), SMA-9 (SHN) and HRG-1 (SLC48A1). In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that inter-organ heme communication is coordinated by both, HRG-7 dependent and HRG-7 independent pathways. This hypothesis is supported by exciting new preliminary data from proteomic, genome-wide RNAi, forward genetic, and RNAseq studies. We will (a) elucidate the molecular mechanisms for a secreted EGF-domain protein in directly regulating HRG-7-dependent signaling pathway; (b) assess the molecular requirement for a transmembrane potassium/ion channel in regulating HRG-7-independent inter-tissue heme signaling pathway; and (c) uncover the mechanisms for adaptor protein complexes in coordinating intestinal heme transport with extra-intestinal heme allocation to regulate systemic heme signaling. Our goals are to acquire a deep understanding of heme-dependent signaling at a tissue and subcellular resolution within the context of an intact animal, as 95% of the total body iron quota in humans is within heme proteins."
10785495,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dr. James Gugger is an Assistant Professor of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania with clinical
expertise in both epilepsy and traumatic brain injury (TBI). His long-term goal as a physician-scientist is to use
quantitative neuroimaging to define neurobiologically grounded phenotypes of neurological disorders, which
will improve our understanding of disorders such as epilepsy and TBI and ultimately improve care.
The neurobiological phenotype of TBI involves both focal and diffuse injury mechanisms. Both animal and human
data implicate damage to the limbic network in those with epilepsy after head injury. This proposal tests the
hypothesis that the effects of focal and diffuse injury mechanisms on the limbic network can be used to
distinguish patients with TBI who will develop epilepsy from those who do not. Experiments will utilize
neuroimaging data from a large, well-phenotyped cohort of participants with TBI and uninjured controls. The
specific aims are (1) to define the relationship between focal post-traumatic lesions and brain networks implicated
in post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) and (2) to determine the profile of diffuse injury in brain networks implicated in
PTE. This project will uncover neuroimaging phenotypes present prior to the onset of PTE and advance us
towards identification of biomarkers for epilepsy risk stratification.
The proposal builds on Dr. Gugger’s prior research on quantitative multimodal neuroimaging in TBI and
epilepsy. With the support of a team of mentors at the University of Pennsylvania who are leaders in the field,
he will gain expertise in functional neuroimaging, statistical modeling of multimodal neuroimaging data, and the
conduct of prospective neuroimaging studies. Dr. Gugger’s team of mentors at the University of Pennsylvania
(Drs. Diaz-Arrastia, Davis, Shinohara, and Detre) have strong track records of mentorship and will provide
specific expertise in his areas of skill development. He will also leverage his existing relationships with large
multicenter consortia focused on PTE research (Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI
[TRACK-TBI] Network, Military Injuries—Understanding PTE: Bioinformatics with big data to examine multi-
modal PTE biomarkers [MINUTE], and the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy
[EpiBioS4Rx]) to launch future studies as an independent physician scientist. Dr. Gugger’s clinical background
in epilepsy and TBI, with the additional support of this career development award and his unique mentorship
opportunities, will position him to succeed as an independent physician-scientist focused on using quantitative
neuroimaging to improve the lives of people with epilepsy and TBI."

Hospital-associated disability (HAD), defined as the new loss of ability to complete one or more activities of daily
living without assistance at hospital discharge, occurs in nearly one-third of all hospitalized patients. HAD and
low mobility during hospitalization are associated with readmissions, permanent disability, new
institutionalization, death and escalating healthcare costs. While access to physical therapy (PT) is critical for
functional improvement, my preliminary data from a single site suggests Black patients face disparities in both
functional impairments and PT referrals. However, it is currently unclear whether this is true across sites, whether
social vulnerability affects these outcomes, or why this occurs. Therefore, this proposal aims to characterize the
association of Black race and social vulnerability with development of HAD and referral for acute and post-acute
physical therapy across a set of Chicago area academic medical centers. I also aim to explore racial differences
in perspectives on mobility loss and participation in PT. I hypothesize that Black race and social vulnerability are
associated with HAD and physical rehabilitation use. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will assess
differences, by race and Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a measure of social vulnerability, in HAD and inpatient
physical therapy referrals in three academic medical centers across Chicago conferring a socioeconomically
diverse patient sample; Aim 2) Across these medical centers, I will also determine differences by race and ADI,
in rates of recommendation for discharge to post-acute care (PAC) facilties for PT and actual discharge to PAC
facilities for PT when recommended; Aim 3) I will use qualitative methods to explore patients’ experiences with
mobility loss and participation in PT during hospitalization; and interdisciplinary care team documentation for
Black vs. White patients. My long-term goal is to develop a model to predict HAD risk and likelihood of benefit
from skilled physical rehabilitation during hospitalization to reduce the burden of HAD on diverse populations of
patients. To accomplish this, I have developed an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Meltzer,
Arora, Lagu) and advisors (Drs. Peek, Chin, Jayaraman, Gibbons) who have a track record of NIH-funding and
successful mentorship of early career investigators. I have formulated an in-depth career development plan to
gain expertise in health disparities research (Chin, Peek, Meltzer), disability and physical rehabilitation in
hospitalized patients, (Arora, Lagu, and Jayaraman), and incorporation of race and social determinants in
statistical modeling to reduce bias (Gibbons, Peek, Chin). Completion of this proposal will train me to address
each level of influence (individual, interpersonal, community, societal) within the “healthcare system” domain of
influence outlined in the NIMHD’s research framework. Equipped with advanced skills and knowledge in health
disparities research methodology and the role of race and racism in healthcare, I will be able to design unbiased
risk prediction tools and physical rehabilitation protocols and lead their culturally-tailored implementation in
diverse populations in future R01 level applications."
10798348,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Glioma is a form of cancer that occurs in glial cells in the brain and central nervous system. Glioma has very
poor prognoses in children and adults due to lack of, or ineffective, available therapies. Commonly used available
therapies for gliomas and other brain cancers include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. However,
these therapies only prolong survival and rarely completely eliminate the tumor. One potential therapy for glioma
that has been tested in clinical trials is CAR T cell therapy targeting epidermal growth factor variant 3 (EGFRviii).
Similar CAR T cell therapies have proven effective and are approved in blood cancers, including diffuse large B-
cell lymphoma (DLBCL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and multiple myeloma. However, CAR T cells
have proven less effective in glioma and other solid tumors and certain tumor cells ‘escape’ from CAR T cell
therapy, and develop resistance to CAR T cells. Potential tumor cell intrinsic factors that may lead to escape
include lack of homogeneous antigen expression, mutations in the EGFRviii target antigen itself, and mutations
in other genes leading to resistance to killing. In this grant, I propose to study genomic and transcriptomic
mechanisms for tumors that escape from CAR T cell therapy, and hypothesize that tumors that escape from
CAR T therapy acquire distinct targetable mutational loads through the activation of APOBEC cytidine
deaminase enzymes. I propose to generate tumors that escape from and develop resistance to sub-optimal T
cell therapies both in vivo and in vitro, and characterize the mutational load and transcriptional changes that
occur upon escape from CAR therapy. Depending on genomic and transcriptomic changes that occur, I will
propose and test either a chemotherapeutic combination targeting mutational pathways such as APOBEC, or an
immunotherapeutic combination therapy targeting neoepitopes in mice. If successful, the overall impact of this
research will be the identification of mutations and changes in gene expression that are the result of CAR T cell
therapy in escaped variants, and a potential combination therapy to target CAR escaped variants."

Racial/ethnic disparities in infectious disease burden are common and can exacerbate existing social
inequalities. Beyond the question of justice, health disparities have major economic consequences that can affect
everyone in society. Previous studies have established the role of both environmental factors (e.g. healthcare
access, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and structural racism, to name a few) and human genetic factors in
susceptibility to infectious diseases. However, systematic and comprehensive assessment of both
sociodemographic and genetic factors that underlie ethnic/racial disparities in infectious disease is lacking. Filling
this gap is important for both clinical care and public health.
To this end, here we will leverage the genetic, electronic health records, and survey data from the All of US
biobank to test the hypothesis that human genetic factors can contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in infectious
disease burden independently of sociodemographic risk factors through the following aims:
Aim 1: To identify demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental factors that contribute
to racial/ethnic disparities in infectious disease prevalence. In this aim, we will perform a comprehensive
assessment of 227 demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental variables, collected through All
of US surveys, on the prevalence of 336 infectious disease phenotypes across fine-scale, genetically-defined
population communities. At the end of this aim, we will know which infectious diseases are enriched or depleted
in which fine-scale racial/ethnic communities and which demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and
environmental variables are the main contributors to these disparities.
Aim 2: To identify human genetic factors that contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in infectious disease
prevalence. In this aim, we will perform in-depth analyses of genetic variants that can be associated with
infectious disease prevalence. We will use complementary approaches to assess common and rare genetic
variants. This aim will lead to the discovery of novel infectious disease susceptibility loci and risk variants. We
will perform in silico functional analysis to gain insight to the function of these variants.
In the short term, this study will result in identifying sociodemographic and genetic risk factors that underlie
racial/ethnic disparities in infectious diseases and understanding their relative contribution to disease prevalence.
Moreover, this project enhances our understanding of infectious disease biology and the genetic factors that
affect interindividual variability in susceptibility to specific pathogens. In the long term, the results of this project
can help the development of new public health policies or new diagnostic tests or drugs for infectious diseases."
10842453,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The lack of effective vaccines against most infectious diseases is largely a result of our fundamental lack of
understanding of mechanisms involved in protective immunity. Adjuvants incorporated into vaccine formulations
have a major impact on vaccine efficacy via modulating and prolonging host immune responses; however, our
understanding of their underlying mechanism(s) of action in driving specific immune parameters is incomplete.
While vaccines are the most effective way to prevent and control infectious diseases, many pathogens that
significantly impact human health remain without an effective vaccine. For example, one-fourth of the world's
population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB)1,
the leading infectious disease killer in the world. It is likely that for TB, and other major infectious diseases (e.g.
AIDS and malaria), new adjuvants or adjuvant combinations will be essential for instructing a protective immune
response. We and others have shown that targeting both the type 1 T helper (Th1) cells and type 17 T helper
(Th17) cells enhance vaccine-induced immunity for TB5-8. Additionally, we have recently demonstrated that live
vaccines (e.g. BCG) and adjuvants (e.g. β-glucan) generate innate memory response, termed trained immunity,
via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes/macrophages, thereby conferring protection against Mtb
infection9,10. These data together suggest that combination adjuvants targeting both innate trained immunity
and adaptive Th1/Th17 cellular responses can enhance protective immunity against pathogens. Thus,
defining the mechanisms of action of combination adjuvants that generate potent trained immunity and protective
Th1/Th17 axis, are the overall goals of this proposal. In the current proposal, we hypothesize that combinations
of adjuvants that drive Th1 responses (AS01 or UM-1007, a novel TLR7/8 agonist) and Th17 responses (β-
glucan, nanoemulsion, or UM-1098, a novel Mincle agonist) will result in Th1/Th17 adaptive responses and/or
enhance trained immunity. We will achieve these overall goals through the following four Specific Aims. Specific
Aim 1: To determine the mechanisms by which combination adjuvants elicit Th1/Th17 immune responses.
Specific Aim 2. To determine the impact of combination adjuvants on hematopoietic stem cells and trained
immunity. Specific Aim 3. To determine whether use of combination adjuvants improves recall Th1/Th17
responses and trained immunity upon challenge. Specific Aim 4. Determine the mechanism of action of
combination adjuvants in a pre-clinical human-like rhesus macaque model. Together, the aims of this study will
map out the pathways induced by combination of adjuvants that effectively drive Th1/Th17 responses and trained
immunity. Through Mtb challenge studies, we will demonstrate whether the mechanisms by which Th1/Th17 and
trained immunity are elicited are involved in protection against pathogen challenge. While we will use TB as a
model system, we envision that dissecting the mechanism of adjuvants-mediated immunity has broader impact
on many other infectious diseases."
10795426,"Impaired vision and blindness due to acute and chronic ocular injury and disease, including glaucoma, optic
nerve stroke, and ocular and head trauma have dramatic consequences on the Veteran’s quality of life. Visual
dysfunctions including visual field defects, loss of acuity and blindness are associated with retinal ganglion cell
(RGC) degeneration and apoptosis. The molecular and cellular events mediating RGC degeneration are poorly
understood, and a deeper understanding is required to develop new approaches to protect RGCs after injury.
Early molecular events that impact RGCs after nerve injury and ocular hypertension have been examined;
however, there is little or no quantitative information about acute cellular changes in RGC excitability, Ca2+
permeability, dendrite morphology and synaptic receptor expression. This is in part due to a lack of experimental
approaches that permitted examination of defined RGC types after injury. These experimental limitations can
now be addressed using genetically identified RGCs, including our newly developed model that allows
examination of RGC structure and synaptic receptors immediately after injury.
RGC degeneration is initiated by high intracellular Ca2+ levels followed by a cascade of deleterious cellular events
that end with RGC death. There are multiple cellular sources that mediate an increase in intracellular Ca2+
including calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) that are located at synapses of RGC dendrites.
RGCs rapidly upregulate CP-AMPARs after ocular injury concomitant with an increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels.
Furthermore, RGC survival is enhanced by CP-AMPAR selective antagonists in chronic, ocular hypertensive
models suggesting that suppression of CP-AMPARs is important for protecting injured RGCs.
Studies will test the hypothesis that limiting CP-AMPAR mediated increase of intracellular Ca2 following
optic nerve injury or during early stages of ocular hypertension will preserve RGC function and structure.
Investigations will focus on acute changes of RGCs during the week after optic nerve injury or induction of
elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and test if RGCs are protected by pharmacological or genetic suppression
of CP-AMPARs. All RGCs express CP-AMPARs, and αRGCs will be used as a model system because their
physiological, structural, and neurochemical properties are well established.
Specific Aim 1 will investigate functional and structural properties of αRGCs following optic nerve injury
or early elevated IOP. Investigations will evaluate αRGC A) physiological properties, including excitability,
synaptic Ca2+ permeability and intracellular Ca2+ levels and B) dendritic field area and complexity, and synaptic
receptor expression. C) Studies will determine if CP-AMPAR expression is regulated by a change in AMPAR
GluA2 subunit level or by the RNA editing enzyme, ADAR2.
Specific Aim 2 will test the effects of pharmacological and genetic suppression of CP-AMPARs on αRGC
functional and structural properties following nerve injury or early elevated IOP. Investigations will test
whether CP-AMPAR antagonist or genetic interventions A) reduce CP-AMPAR upregulation and suppress
intracellular Ca2+ increase in αRGCs and B) maintain αRGC physiological properties, dendritic structure, synaptic
receptor expression. C) Studies will determine optomotor responses and long-term RGC survival and D) test if
glial activation is regulated by treatments targeting suppression of RGC CP-AMPARs."
10805600,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is common in Veterans and is the leading cause of disability
worldwide. Unfortunately, many Veterans with MDD do not respond to conventional pharmacological
interventions. TMS offers a noninvasive, nonpharmacological treatment option that is effective for treatment-
resistant MDD. This therapeutic approach uses repetitive pulsed magnetic fields to induce depolarization in
brain regions that, in turn, modulate neural networks and alter pathological patterns of brain activity seen in
depression. TMS lacks the systematic side effects associated with pharmacological treatments for MDD and is
generally well-tolerated and safe. Furthermore, there is emerging literature supporting the use of TMS for a wide
range of neuropsychiatric disorders for which pharmacotherapy offers limited efficacy.
 Despite this therapeutic promise, TMS remains an underutilized psychiatric treatment. Challenges
limiting more widespread adoption of TMS include the time commitment for patients and clinicians and variable
responses to treatment. Understanding this variability in treatment response would help optimize the delivery
of TMS to Veterans, increase the percentage of successful treatments, and provide a starting point for integrating
measurement-based care approaches with TMS protocols. This CDA2 proposes an approach to understand this
variability in TMS treatment response and optimize TMS treatments in Veterans inexpensively.
 This project will utilize clinical data from several hundred Veterans who have received and will receive
TMS for the treatment of depression as part of the nationwide “VA TMS Pilot Program”. This multisite VA effort
was designed to both deliver clinical TMS to Veterans with MDD and provide a mechanism for VA scientists to
investigate TMS outcomes and predictors of treatment response. A key feature of this program is the
implementation of a standardized REDCap database that is used to collect data from clinical questionnaires as
part of the VHA Measurement-Based Care initiative. These instruments measure various aspects of psychiatric
symptomology. Over 1000 Veterans have begun TMS through this program.
 This project will use this clinical longitudinal data to replicate and expand a nonlinear modeling approach
of the TMS treatment response that we have developed using clinical data from our lab (n=97) as well as
published group-level data from multiple large clinical trials of TMS. This nonlinear modeling approach uses an
exponential decay function to quantify the magnitude, speed, and outcome of TMS treatment response that
utilizes all of the time points of symptom ratings before, during, and after TMS treatment. This provides a
comprehensive estimate of the total TMS treatment course as well as an approach to predict treatment response.
This CDA2 will replicate and expand this work using the largest dataset of TMS response in Veterans to date and
will potentially yield precision psychiatry tools that would be widely applicable to many psychiatric interventions.
 Work proposed in this project will lay the foundation for a VA Merit proposal by the end of the CDA2
period, anticipated to focus on prospectively testing and implementing treatment algorithms to guide clinical
TMS decisions and optimize outcome."
10805730,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other types of tauopathies are proteinopathies. The unfolded protein
response (UPR) which is a cellular response to remediate proteinopathy in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
has been observed in post-mortem brains in several neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulation of the ER
stress response is suggested also by genetic evidence. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated
with increased risk for tauopathy were identified by multiple large Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
for PERK (Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 3). PERK acts as one of the sensors and
responders for ER stress, regulating a coordinated cellular response to maintain protein quality and to resolve
proteostatic stress due to misfolded proteins. The integrity of the UPR when faced with ER stress must be
kept intact to maintain the integrity of the proteome. Alterations of these fundamental mechanisms will result in
cellular demise and degeneration. Although the tauopathy-related PERK risk variant is found in about 30% of
the population, how the SNPs affect the performance of the UPR is not clear. Nor do we yet know if the
carriers of the risk SNPs can alter their UPR response through pharmacological interventions. Filling this gap in
our understanding of the genetic variation dependent regulation of PERK function will enable us to more
effectively target this pathway, improving clinical trial outcomes and clinical management efficacy. In this
proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the SNPs enhance PERK activation, exacerbating the
neurodegenerative process, and that it can be reversed by blocking the Integrated Stress Response (ISR).
The tauopathy related PERK risk variant identified in GWAS is in the same haplotype with three SNPs in the
coding region, namely p.S136C, p.R166Q and p.S704A (PERK Haplotype B). We found that the PERK
Haplotype B compared to its isogenic control caused gain of function. In this proposal, we will test the
hypothesis that the SNPs enhance PERK activation, exacerbating the neurodegenerative process, and that it
can be reversed by blocking the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). We have also generated an isogenic
mouse model with the PERK risk variant for testing this hypothesis in vivo. We have a team of investigators
experienced in the methodologies for studying neurodegeneration and ER stress using the human induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) in vitro and mouse in vivo models. We will test our hypothesis in two aims. Aim
1: Determine how the PERK risk SNP variants confer GOF of PERK activity and neurodegeneration. Aim 2:
Determine if PERK Haplotype B risk variant accelerates neurodegeneration through overactivation of the ISR
in vivo. Our goals are to use the knowledge gained in this application to establish a targeted treatment
response dependent on the genotype, for ISR inhibitors and personalized therapy that would be most effective
for the patients based on their PERK genotypes."

A new small-molecule kinase inhibitor for airway disease
Summary
NuPeak Therapeutics Inc. is a biotechnology company (C corporation) designed to deliver a first-in-class small-
molecule kinase inhibitor for therapeutic use in humans. The present project is aimed at the next steps to develop
an inhibitor for treatment of respiratory airway disease especially due to asthma and COPD, which remain leading
causes of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide despite current therapeutic approaches. Moreover,
there is growing recognition that these diseases are linked to airway inflammation and mucus production in
response to respiratory viruses, allergens, or toxins. In that context, we identified a mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) known as MAPK13 that drives the key features of respiratory airway disease in human cell and
animal models. We also validated critical components of this pathway in asthma, COPD and long-term Covid-
19, suggesting the therapeutic benefit of a MAPK13 inhibitor in these patient populations. Further, this relatively
orphan kinase was dismissed in favor of conventional inflammatory signals and was untargeted in previous
kinase-inhibitor screens. Therefore, we used structure-based drug design to engineer proprietary small-molecule
kinase inhibitors against MAPK13 and arrived at a lead candidate compound (NuP-4A) based on physical-
chemical attributes, cell safety, enzyme inhibition, binding mechanism, interaction kinetics, kinome selectivity,
pharmacokinetics, and animal safety. Consistent with these attributes, NuP-4A provides highly potent and safe
correction in disease models. Notably, NuP-4A treatment corrects the basal-epithelial stem cell activation that
drives the key disease phenotypes. This benefit is equivalent to Mapk13-deficiency or combined MAPK13-14
blockade in disease models. Initial toxicology studies suggest that NuP-4A will deliver a satisfactory safety
margin in vivo. and provides a firm basis to move NuP-4A to the next stage of drug development. Smart delivery
using intravenous and inhaled dosing will guide an effective, safe, and practical continuum of care for airway
diseases. Here we concentrate on the next steps in our intravenous dosing program developed in concert with
FDA recommendations. Thus, we propose a STTR Phase II program for NuPeak and Washington University to
advance NuP-4A under the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 will optimize dosing and biomarkers in preclinical
models to refine our clinical trial design; Aim 2 will complete the final non-GLP and GLP pharmacology and
toxicology testing to obtain IND approval; Aim 3 will move our Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC)
process into a commercial facility to support clinical trials. The combined Aims will fully prepare the project for
Phase 1 Clinical Trials in humans. NuPeak will operate with the entrepreneurial resources of BioGenerator and
Harrington Discovery Institute and a license from Washington University under a patent for composition and use
of MAPK13 inhibitors, including NuP-4A and back-ups. The commercialization plan is based on completing STTR
Phase II milestones and then performing Phase 1 and then more advanced clinical trials with support from STTR
Phase IIB/III, DOD Clinical Trial Award, Missouri Technology Corporation, and private investors."
10808676,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) infect mucosal epithelia and cause nearly 5% of cancers worldwide.
Other HPVs infect cutaneous epithelia and cause benign or pathogenic lesions. One hallmark of papillomavirus
biology is the virus’ ability to establish persistent infections in the proliferative basal layer of stratified squamous
epithelia. The mechanisms used by papillomaviruses to direct cells to be retained in the basal layer of stratified
epithelia, which are dynamic tissues that are subject to constant cell turnover, are poorly understood. The goal
of this proposal is to test whether specific activities of the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins from mucosal and
cutaneous HPV genotypes drive cell retention in the basal epithelial layer. The work will use a powerful model
developed in my lab to track the migration of epithelial cells in engineered three-dimensional tissue.
We hypothesize that different papillomaviruses activate YAP1 and/or inhibit Notch signaling to promote cell
persistence in the basal epithelial layer. We have identified several mechanisms by which HPV E6 and E7
proteins repress epithelial differentiation in response to a stimulus in two-dimensional cell culture models. Our
data support that the ability of HPV E6 and E7 proteins to repress the commitment to epithelial differentiation is
correlated with their ability to promote basal identity. We found that high-risk mucosal HPV E7 proteins bind and
degrade the tumor suppressor PTPN14. PTPN14 degradation activates YAP1, a powerful driver of epithelial cell
proliferation and basal identity. When high-risk HPV E7 proteins activate YAP1, cells resist differentiation signals
and are more likely to be retained in the basal epithelial layer. Cutaneous HPV E6 proteins bind the transcriptional
co-regulator MAML1. E6 binding to MAML1 blocks Notch signaling, repressing differentiation. We predict that
E6 binding to MAML1 directs basal identity.
The work will systematically determine which activities of E6 and E7 promote basal identity and whether
interfering with such activities will prevent HPV-infected cells from being retained in the basal epithelial layer.
The aims are 1) to test whether inhibition of HPV E7-mediated PTPN14 degradation limits basal cell retention
and 2) to determine whether HPV E6 proteins promote basal cell retention by repressing Notch signaling. We
have developed a robust and physiologically relevant assay for epithelial basal cell identity. We are ideally poised
to apply the assay to identify the basis of the basal retention activities of HPV oncoproteins. Understanding the
mechanisms by which HPV establish and maintain basal epithelial identity, which is required for persistent
infections, will elucidate principles of epithelial biology and tumor virology. It will, in the long term, enable new
therapeutic approaches to treat HPV-positive cancers and premalignant lesions."
10808678,"Summary
Infections with encapsulated bacteria are responsible for the death of millions of children and the elderly each
year. Capsular polysaccharides behave as T-independent antigens (TI) and vaccination based on these
carbohydrates provides protection against these infections. The efficacy of vaccines against TI antigens is
severely limited by their inability to induce recall responses upon revaccination or infection. This phenomenon
depends on inhibition of memory B cells by antigen-specific IgG generated in the primary response. The
mechanism behind this inhibitory activity however, remains unclear. The efficacy of vaccines critically
depends on adjuvants that can promote strong memory and influence Ig class switch recombination (CSR).
However, effective adjuvants for TI antigens vaccination are not available. The goal of our proposal is to
answer two outstanding questions regarding the response to TI antigens: what is the mechanism of the
inhibition of recall responses? and how can CSR and generation of memory B cells can be manipulated to
improve vaccination? For these studies we will use a mouse model of tularemia and will use Francisella
tularensis LPS, a model TI antigen that we showed activates B1 cells. In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that
IgG-LPS immune complexes inhibit memory B1 cells reactivation and IgM production through complement
activation. We will test whether complement depletion or absence could restore the recall response to
vaccination with TI antigens and result in a more effective vaccine for tularemia. In aim 2 we will test the
hypothesis that novel adjuvants can improve recall responses to TI antigen by manipulating CSR in B1 cells
and/or improving generation of memory B1. Based on our preliminary results we will test a number of
potential adjuvant treatments with the goal of achieving sustained IgM and increased LPS-specific IgA
production but reduced IgG (responsible for inhibition of recall response). These adjuvants are also expected
to increased numbers of memory B1 cells. If successful, our studies will create proof of concepts that can
inform future development of more effective vaccination strategies for TI antigens."
10808504,"Project Summary/Abstract
Increased ribosome biogenesis is a hallmark of cancer and reflects the increased and pervasive protein
synthetic needs of the cancer cells. Targeting this process by curbing the rate-limiting step, RNA polymerase I
(Pol I) transcription, using specific inhibitors abrogating this activity, is a promising strategy for cancer therapy.
BMH-21 is a first-in-class small molecule that inhibits Pol I transcription and large-scale cancer cell line
screens demonstrated its potent efficacy across broad cancer lineages. However, a heterogeneous response
was observed emphasizing the presence of mechanisms dampening the therapeutic response. Genome-wide
positive selection CRISPR Cas9 knock-out screens were performed in human colorectal carcinoma cells to
identify genes that cause resistance to the selective inhibition of Pol I. The screens identified all key positive
regulators of the mTORC1 pathway accounting for the resistance. mTOR is a major driver of ribosome
biogenesis and cellular translational programs and considered essential for cancer growth. The inactivation of
mTOR as a resistance mechanism is counterintuitive, as this mechanism requires a reduced translational state
by the cancer cells and inactivation of two key pathways enabling protein synthesis. These unexpected
findings led to the hypothesis that cancer cells evade severe ribosome biogenesis stress by switching off
mTOR-dependent translational pathways. This premise stipulates that bypass mechanisms have evolved to
facilitate translation of essential proteins for survival and growth when cancer cells face obstacles in protein
translation. This concept will be tested using pharmacological and genetic approaches that block mTOR. The
goal of the project is to gain knowledge on the mechanisms that enable unabated ribosome translation in
cancer cells. The following aims will be implemented to achieve this goal: Aim 1. Identify genes driving
resistance to Pol I and translation inhibitor, Aim 2. Investigate the translational activity maintained under
translation stress in cancer cells and Aim 3. Identify the regulators of ribosome activity that support survival by
translation stress. By executing these aims we will gain knowledge how cancer cells survive severe
translational stress and the mechanisms of this escape. These studies will identify critical processes and
proteins required for survival and how their translation is maintained with limited ribosome numbers. These
findings have implications in therapeutic strategies that target ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis and
translation and the approaches are designed to use this knowledge to develop new combination strategies to
overcome these resistance mechanisms."

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is committed to improving the quality of life for people
with sickle cell disease (SCD) globally. India is home to the world’s second largest population with SCD or
asymptomatic sickle cell trait (SCT). Unlike the more widely studied African SCD, most Indian women do not
know if they have either SCT or SCD until they are screened during antenatal care, as mandated by the Indian
Government. In India, the process of screening for SCT/SCD during pregnancy is complicated, involving using
the cheap and easily available “solubility test,” to detect the presence of sickle hemoglobin (HbS). The test is
positive in those with SCT as well as those with SCD. Pregnant women with a positive solubility test and their
partner undergo hemoglobin electrophoresis to determine their actual sickle cell status and the risk of unborn
child having SCD. We hypothesized that the women who inform their partner about a positive solubility test
may be at increased risk of intimate partner violence (IPV), because sickle cell literacy is low and IPV is
accepted and normalized. Using a Boston University Early Career Catalyst Award, I recently compared the
rates of IPV in the six months before and after 182 pregnant women in Nagpur, India learned that their
solubility test result. Pregnant women with a positive test (n=91) were twice as likely to experience IPV
compared to women with a negative test (n=91). Women who experienced IPV were three times as likely as
those who experienced no IPV to deliver low birthweight babies, especially when they also reported symptoms
of depression or anxiety. For this K01 award, my training objectives include gaining expertise in: (1) clinical and
psychosocial aspects of SCT/SCD; (2) intervention development and evaluation; and, (3) implementation
science theory and methods. I will use these skills to advance my research objective of implementing and pilot-
testing a couple-based HIV screening and disclosure intervention adapted for SCT/SCD, with an explicit focus
on IPV prevention and mental-health promotion. I propose using the 8-phased ADAPT-ITT framework and the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to guide adaptation and implementation of the
Jamii Bora intervention developed by mentor Dr. Janet Turan (R34MH102103). The three aims of this study
include: conducting formative research to inform Jamii Bora adaptation (AIM 1); adapting the Jamii Bora
intervention using ADAPT-ITT (Phases 2-7) (AIM 2), and pilot-testing the adapted intervention for feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy (AIM 3). I will leverage the infrastructure of the Nagpur site of NICHD’s
Global Network for Women and Children’s Health Research, directed by my primary mentor, Dr. Hibberd and
co-mentor Dr. Patel (UG1HD078439)."
10920484,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 During development, individual neurons extend highly branched neurites that innervate the surrounding
territory with minimal overlap. In mammals, the clustered protocadherins (Pcdh) provide each neuron with a
unique cell specific identity required for self-identification and self-avoidance in the brain. Individual PCDHa/b/g
protein isoforms cis-dimerize, and engage in homophilic trans interactions to create a lattice-like structure at
contacting membrane surfaces, providing the diversity required for self-recognition. Deletion of Pcdh genes in
mice results in deficits in neuronal wiring and altered behaviors. Biophysical and structural data, cellular
assays, and functional studies support a model in which perfect homophilic matching of PCDH isoforms leads
to the assembly of an extended PCDH lattice structure on sister neurites, triggering intracellular signaling, and
a series of yet to be identified steps leading to self-avoidance. Many neuronal transmembrane proteins execute
neurodevelopmental processes through both nuclear and membrane associated signaling mechanisms;
however, the mechanisms regulating PCDH mediated self-avoidance remain unknown.
 My recent work in the Maniatis lab has demonstrated that the PCDHa/g intracellular domain (ICDs) are
required for interactions with protein partners at the membrane (e.g. WAVE complex and WNT signaling
modulators) and in the nucleus (e.g. chromatin and transcriptional regulators). In the nucleus, the PCDH-ICD
interacts with and may regulate the expression of genes involved in axon guidance, synapse formation and
participate in an auto-regulatory feedback loop. During the K99 phase, I will leverage these preliminary findings
to assess the need for each downstream signaling mechanism for proper self-avoidance in vitro (Aim 1) and in
vivo (Aim 2). During the independent R00 phase, I will implement knowledge and techniques acquired in the
mentored phase to investigate whether PCDH SNVs from ASD cases disrupt the identified downstream
signaling mechanisms, proper self-avoidance and neural circuitry during development (Aim 3). Understanding
the mechanisms of self-avoidance is a fundamental step toward revealing how neural circuits are formed
during development in vertebrates and could have important implications for neurodevelopmental disorders.
 The work described in the mentored portion of this proposal will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr.
Maniatis, who has a strong record of mentoring postdoctoral research scientists who have transitioned into
their own laboratories. Ultimately, this award will allow me to accomplish three broad training goals including;
(1) learning to address biological questions using in vivo models, (2) developing and extending my knowledge
of molecular and genetic approaches to probe gene function, and (3) expanding on my background in iPSC
based disease modeling by probing PCDH function in cortical organoids. Achieving these goals and training
will provide me with the strong foundation required to pursue a faculty position at a research institution where I
can integrate in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate novel questions in the field of neurodevelopment."

The primary training objective of the K99 phase of this award application is to mold the candidate into an
expert in assessing behavioral engagement for reward using advanced in vivo electrophysiology methods. He
will learn required analytical techniques for comprehensively measuring aspects of behavioral engagement and
correlated brain activity patterns. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that Locus Coeruleus-cortical
circuits regulate engagement when responding for alcohol, which is increased by protracted alcohol drinking.
To address this hypothesis, this award will use Cambridge NeuroTech high-density silicon probes to record
neural activity within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula (aINS), and also will use
chemogenetic manipulation of noradrenaline signaling, during the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT)
in mice responding for alcohol. During the K99 phase, the candidate will be trained in the use of high-density
probes to generate large neural recording data sets to discover the relationship of ACC and aINS activity to
behavioral engagement for sugar within the 5-CSRTT (a robust and widely used model). To obtain this training,
the candidate will work with leading researchers at Indiana University with expertise in neural recording
implementation and analyses. During the R00 phase, the candidate will use his recently published paradigm of
behavioral engagement for alcohol in 5-CSRTT combined with K99 training to further support his hypothesis.
Critical goals of this award are publishing results in high-impact journals, oral and poster presentations at
conferences and attending relevant seminars to further the candidate’s career development and exposure
within neuroscience/alcohol research community. In this proposal, Drs. Frederic Hopf, Christopher Lapish,
Catharine Winstanley, Brian Mathur, and Nicholas Grahame will form a dedicated mentoring team for the
candidate. Combined, these individuals hold expertise in relevant rodent behavior, in vivo electrophysiology in
awake animals, alcohol research, noradrenaline signaling, and relevant cortical regions investigated in this
proposal. The Indiana Alcohol Research Center, a collaboration between Indiana University and Indiana
University-Purdue University-Indianapolis, provides a nationally recognized research environment with the
resources necessary to complete the Aims within this proposal, as well as an exceptional mentoring
environment. At the end of the K99 phase, the candidate will be seeking a faculty position as an independent
investigator at an institution well-suited to for his R00 phase. The experiments in these studies will provide
valuable groundwork for future R01 applications that will incorporate methods for projection-specific circuit
inhibition and explore potential therapeutic avenues to attenuate maladaptive alcohol-engagement behaviors
for future clinical benefit. Together, this award will provide a strong foundation for the candidate to build a
successful career as an independent researcher within the alcohol field and contribute to the forward progress
needed for combating problem alcohol use."
10808647,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are common conditions that cause significant maternal
morbidity during the birthing process. Guidelines encourage routine delivery management with induction of labor,
but my prior work demonstrated many patients across the US are not receiving this care, and instead have high
rates of cesarean delivery. This variation may occur because current guidelines lack specificity for patients with
HDP complications or factors that increase risk of induction of labor, where it is unknown if induction of labor
continues to be favored. My preliminary data from NYU reports up to 20% of those undergoing induction for HDP
develop abnormal vital signs, lab abnormalities, or symptoms consistent with progression of HDP. However, it is
unknown how the risks of induction of labor compare to those of immediate cesarean delivery. Without a more
nuanced understanding of how delivery decisions and clinical factors influence outcomes, too many may be
receiving a potentially unnecessary cesarean delivery (when induction of labor would have improved
outcomes), or experiencing potential excess morbidity from induction of labor, when immediate cesarean
delivery may have been favored.
 This proposal will characterize the risks of each delivery decision with more precision and potentially
develop a decision model to guide individual-level decision making. To accomplish this, in Aim 1 we will use a
large representative dataset to compare maternal health outcomes among comparable newly diagnosed
patients with HDP based on delivery decision (induction of labor versus immediate cesarean delivery). In Aim 2
we will potentially develop a decision model for delivery decisions between induction of labor and immediate
CD, incorporating patient preferences and long-term health outcomes. In Aim 3 we will identify perceived
clinical, structural, and cognitive factors informing delivery through clinician focus groups and patient
interviews. I have assembled a mentorship team, led by Dr. Scott Braithwaite, with the expertise to supervise
this research proposal and its corresponding training objectives. My training objectives are to 1) develop
advanced skills in perinatal epidemiology and causal inference techniques 2) acquire expertise in decision
science incorporating advanced risk prediction and 3) train in qualitative and mixed methods, conducting focus
groups and patient interviews, coding, and analyzing qualitative data. My long-term career goal is to become
an independent physician scientist with a research program that focuses on improving risk prediction and
clinical decision-making in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The proposed training and research plan will
prepare me to succeed as an independent investigator."
10812342,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Paneth cells (PC) are specialized small intestinal epithelial cells that control microbial populations in the gut
through the secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Importantly, PC dysfunction is emerging as a driver of
disease development in several gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, including Crohn’s disease, necrotizing enterocol-
itis, and graft-versus-host disease. These disorders have limited therapeutic options, which often carry significant
immunosuppressive and/or surgical risks. Ultimately, developing therapies to enhance PC function may provide
a novel treatment strategy for these diseases. To accomplish this, further understanding of the regulatory mech-
anisms responsible for normal PC biology is required. To this end, the present study seeks to build upon previ-
ously published work from this applicant’s lab, which demonstrates that the enteric microbiota significantly influ-
ence PC biology. Specifically, the objective of this application is to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which
the resident gut microbiota exert their regulatory effects on PCs. The clinical rationale for this work is that the
knowledge obtained will support the design of targeted strategies that augment PC function to putatively treat a
spectrum of GI disease. The central hypothesis of this study is that the enteric microbiota increase PC census
and promote AMP production via signaling through the subepithelial tissue (i.e. tissue underlying the intestinal
epithelium). This hypothesis will be tested via two independent aims that respectively focus on host and microbial
elements of PC regulation. In Aim 1, we seek to determine how specific subepithelial tissue factors are able to
regulate PC function. Directed by our preliminary data, we will combine (A) targeted studies focused on IL22,
with (B) a broader screen of rationally-selected additional molecules (Il17a, Retnlb, Jchain, S100a9, Cxcl5) to
identify novel mechanisms by which the subepithelial tissue regulates PC biology. In Aim 2, the microbial side
of these interactions will be explored. This will be facilitated by a novel PC-reporter mouse (Defa6-cre;td-To-
mato) we have developed, which will be studied in both conventional and germ-free housing conditions. Specif-
ically, these mice will be used to: (A) determine if bacteria implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease
(which has been linked to PC dysfunction) differentially regulate PC biology; and (B) ascertain if PC function can
be enhanced using the established clinical probiotic, VSL#3 – both at homeostasis and during inflammation. In
combination, these aims are expected to identify host (Aim 1) and microbial (Aim 2) elements that can regulate
PC function. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it explores the novel hypothesis
that the subepithelial tissue is required to mediate microbial influences on PC biology. This substantially expands
the conceptual framework of previous studies, which suggest that luminal bacteria directly interact with PCs to
simulate antimicrobial function. The expected findings are significant because they will provide scientific justifi-
cation for the development and future testing of novel agents that can clinically augment PC function. This has
the potential to offer patients with limited therapeutic options new approaches for the treatment of their disease."

Industrial accidents involving chlorine (Cl2) occur once every 2-3 days in the United States (US) and are
associated with higher risk of death and injuries compared to other toxicants. One out of 13 African Americans
have Sickle Cell Trait (SCT) which is the carrier state of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Therefore, they have a high
chance of being involved in Cl2 accidents. People with SCT are at high risk of sudden death and multiorgan
failure when exposed to stressful conditions such as high-altitude hypoxia, environmental heat, and exercise.
These injuries are mediated by acute hemolysis and rhabdomyolysis with the release of free hemoglobin and
myoglobin. Consequently, individuals with SCT can be more vulnerable to multiorgan injury and death when
exposed to Cl2. We have shown that Cl2 inhalation results in higher death rate in humanized SCD mice and that
Cl2 action is mediated by acute hemolysis. Haptoglobin is an acute phase protein that neutralizes free-
hemoglobin and myoglobin thus limiting their toxicity. As a result, haptoglobin has been approved in Europe and
Japan to treat acute hemolysis associated conditions that overwhelm the endogenous haptoglobin system.
Therefore, our hypothesis is that Cl2 inhalation induces exaggerated hemolysis and rhabdomyolysis in
humanized SCT mice resulting in increased multiorgan injury (lungs, kidneys, and heart) and death compared
to humanized normal hemoglobin control mice. We further hypothesize that postexposure administration of
haptoglobin improves the outcomes of Cl2 inhalation by scavenging free hemoglobin and myoglobin. To test this
hypothesis, we are proposing (Aim 1) to determine if humanized SCT mice are more susceptible to multiorgan
failure when exposed to Cl2 inhalation. We will test in (Aim 1A) if SCT develop exaggerated hemolysis and
rhabdomyolysis after Cl2 exposure compared to control mice, and in (Aim 1B) we will investigate whether Cl2
inhalation induces more severe multiorgan injury (lungs, kidneys, and heart) in the SCT mice compared to control
mice. In (Aim 2) we will investigate the therapeutic benefits haptoglobin administration after Cl2 exposure. (Aim
2A) will test if haptoglobin compared to vehicle reduces the long-term effects of Cl2 inhalation on the vital organs
(lungs, kidneys, and heart) by evaluating their functions and structures 14 days after Cl2 exposure. While (Aim
2B) will examine if haptoglobin reduces the death rate of SCT mice within 2 weeks of Cl2 inhalation. The work is
innovative as it will 1) show for the first time if people with SCT are at higher risk of death and multiorgan failure
when exposed to Cl2 as an example of toxic inhalants, 2) it will detail the mechanism of Cl2 induced organ injury
in SCT, and 3) it will provide a strong preclinical proof of targeted therapy, haptoglobin, for this vulnerable
population. Consequently, 4) haptoglobin can be tested in other conditions associated with acute hemolysis in
SCT and SCD population to improve their survival and quality of life towards decreasing the health disparity."
10812344,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) have the potential to improve the health and well-being of more
than 2.1 million Americans with OUD, however, long-term adherence particularly to buprenorphine is alarmingly
poor. Pain, mental health, and substance use disorders are increasingly recognized as risk factors for inadequate
treatment adherence and often co-occur in families due to shared genetic and environmental factors.
Understanding comorbidities in patients with OUD and their family members, and the impact of these
comorbidities on poor opioid use outcomes, can help identify patients at risk for inadequate treatment adherence
and serious adverse events. Further, information on the costs associated with buprenorphine non-adherence
and family comorbidities can inform health insurance reimbursement policies. The overall career goal of the
recipient is to become a leading pharmacoepidemiologist focused on improving treatment for substance use
disorders, particularly opioid use disorders. The goal of this K01 is to train the recipient to investigate associations
between family comorbidities and/or prescription medications with a high risk of misuse and buprenorphine
treatment adherence, opioid use outcomes, and costs to the family unit and health insurer. Research aims of
this project are to: (1) develop a clinically relevant prediction model to identify patients prescribed buprenorphine
at risk of inadequate adherence; (2) determine whether other prescriptions in the family are associated with poor
buprenorphine adherence and opioid-related adverse events; and (3) compare overall healthcare costs to the
family and health insurer across varying levels of buprenorphine adherence. The training aims of this project are
to: (1) gain understanding of the clinical assessment and diagnosis of opioid use disorders and comorbid mental
health conditions; (2) learn and apply innovative methods for dyadic data analyses; (3) learn and apply methods
for conducting economic evaluations of substance use treatment; (4) hone professional skills in research,
publishing, and project administration; and (5) responsible conduct of research. Training aims will be pursued
through tutorials with world-renowned experts forming the recipient's mentorship team, graduate-level
coursework, workshops and seminars, participation in scientific meetings, and mentored research. Research
aims will be accomplished using the OptumLabs Data Warehouse, a large integrated commercial healthcare
insurance claims database that tracks beneficiaries, spouses, and dependents across health plans and over
time. This project will fill an important gap in our understanding of how family comorbidities and medication use
by family members influence MOUD treatment adherence, outcomes, and costs, and will provide evidence to
support interventions by clinicians and health insurers to improve MOUD adherence outcomes."

 Lipid droplets (LDs) are cytosolic organelles that serve as the major energy reservoir in most
cell types. Dynamics LDs are tightly linked to the regulation of metabolic homeostasis. Nascent
LDs are generated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the key factors that are
involved in the biogenesis of the LDs are poorly understood. Interestingly, we recently discovered
that dynamin-related-protein1 (DRP1), a well-known mitochondrial fission protein, translocates
onto ER and regulates the dissociation of the nascent LDs from the ER. Here, based on our
preliminary observations, we hypothesize that DRP1 on ER directly fissions micro-LDs via its
GTPase activity. To test the hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will define
the molecular mechanism(s) governing DRP1-mediated LD budding off from ER. Previously we
found that lack of DRP1 leads to the retention of the nascent LDs in ER. To determine the direct
fission function of DRP1 on the ER-bound LDs, we will apply both in vitro and in vivo systems that
compositionally mimic the tubular topology of ER-LD to analyze DRP1 constricting and severing
capacity. We will also determine whether GTPase domain in DRP1 is required for LD budding by
applying a GTPase mutant (S38A) of DRP1 in the study. In Aim 2, we will define the cellular
mechanism(s) governing the recruitment of DRP1 onto the ER. We will first determine how cAMP-
PKA signaling regulates translocalization of DRP1 onto the ER. Specifically, we will analyze the
phosphorylation sites in DRP1 by PKA and the function of the identified sites on its ER location.
Then, we will study the molecular role of Seipin, a known ER membrane protein in ER-recruitment
of DRP1. Specifically, we will determine the interaction between DRP1 and Seipin and detect the
impaired ER-recruitment of DRP1 in the lieu of the loss-of-function of Seipin. In Aim 3, we will
study the abnormal ER-LD phenotype in the DRP1-deficient adipocytes. First, we will investigate
the abnormal changes on the pre-existing cytosol LDs by examining their size, number,
morphology as well as the consequential effects on LD degradation and lipid metabolism. Then,
we will examine the ER morphological changes, ER stress and hence other associated
pathological changes. Collectively, the goal of the study is to achieve fundamental findings about
DRP1 novel function on LD biogenesis.
 Understanding the critical factors, such as DRP1 and the detailed events in LD biogenesis and
dynamics will not only help us to dissect the basic cellular function of LDs on lipid metabolism,
but also shed light on the novel strategies to treat obesity-related lipid disorders."
10812449,"PROJECT SUMMARY
ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, gated by intracellular nucleotides ATP and ADP, couple cell
energetics with membrane excitability to govern a wide range of physiological processes vital to energy
homeostasis. KATP channels are unique hetero-octameric membrane protein complexes of four inward rectifier K+
channel (Kir6.1 or Kir6.2) subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1, SUR2A, or SUR2B) subunits. Various
Kir6.x/SURx combinations generate KATP channel isoforms with distinct tissue distribution, nucleotide sensitivity,
and pharmacology. The most prominent KATP channels are those of Kir6.2/SUR1, Kir6.2/SUR2A, and
Kir6.1/SUR2B combinations, representing the major pancreatic, cardiac, and vascular smooth muscle isoforms,
respectively. Genetic mutations in the various KATP channels underlie a number of endocrine, cardiovascular, and
neuronal, and muscular diseases, as exemplified by Cantú syndrome, a severe pleiotropic systemic hypotension
disorder caused by gain of function mutations in the vascular Kir6.1/SUR2B KATP channel. A central goal in the
KATP channel field is to understand the structure-function relationship of KATP channel isoforms in order to develop
mechanism-based, isoform-specific therapies for disease caused by KATP channel dysfunction. A key barrier to
progress has been a lack of high resolution channel structures. Recently, we have broken this barrier by resolving
3D structures of the pancreatic Kir6.2/SUR1 channel to near atomic resolutions using cryoEM. In this new
application, we seek to carry this momentum and determine structures of the other KATP channel isoforms. We
hypothesize that comparing and contrasting related KATP channel complexes will reveal the general design
principles that allow KATP channels to operate as ATP/ADP sensors and the specific mechanisms that underlie the
unique gating properties and pharmacology of different KATP channel isoforms. We will test the hypothesis using a
multipronged approach that combines single-particle cryoEM, molecular dynamics simulations, in silico
compound screening, and functional assays in three independent but integrated Specific Aims. (1) Determine
cryoEM structures and conformational dynamics of KATP channel isoforms in apo, inhibitors-bound and activators-
bound states. (2) Test mechanistic hypotheses on KATP channel isoform-specific biophysical properties,
nucleotides sensitivities, and pharmacology. (3) Conduct proof-of-concept structure-based drug discovery studies
towards targeted pharmacology for Cantú mutations in vascular KATP channels. The scientific premise of the
proposal is built on a wealth of KATP channel literature and rigorous preliminary and published studies from the
applicant and her co-investigator and collaborators. The proposal is innovative as it aims to generate new
structures, establish new concepts in KATP gating regulation mechanisms, and discover new vascular KATP
channel inhibitors for Cantú patients. Successful outcome will advance structural knowledge of KATP regulation in
health and disease, and shift KATP pharmacology towards a structure-based paradigm to significantly impact the
field. It will also have broad implications for other ABC transporters and ion channels critical for human health."
10916286,"SUMMARY-ABSTRACT
 The overall goal of this proposal is to use highly multiplexed, high-resolution imaging of
tissues and tumors to deeply characterize the microenvironments of diverse solid tumors being
studied by NCI-funded collaborators at the Harvard Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology
(LSP), Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center and four other NCI cancer centers. The PI of this
proposal, Research Specialist Jerry Lin PhD, invented tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence
(CyCIF) in 2018 and has made it the leading public domain (license-free) method for performing
high-plex tissue analysis. He has adapted the method to high resolution 3D imaging of selected
fields of view (~103 cells using deconvolution microscopy) as well as rapid analysis of whole
slides (~106 cells) at lower resolution. As developed CyCIF can collect data from 20-60 protein
markers from a single specimen making it possible to identify cell types and states in a
preserved tissue environment. It can also image structures as small as immune synapses
allowing cell-cell interactions to be analyzed at a functional level. Dr. Lin’s work directly supports
research by 18 NCI-funded laboratories and the CyCIF protocols he has published are used by
multiple other labs working independent of the HMS team. Dr. Lin also performs his own
research as part of a Human Tumor Atlas Network Trans Network Project that conceived and
now leads. These activities have resulted in 20 collaborative publications over the past three
years including several in high impact journals with Dr. Lin as first or co-first author.
 As part of this R50 proposal Dr Lin will engage in three primary activities. First, he will
continue to collaborate with research groups to acquire CyCIF data at different stages before
and after treatment. This is will make it possible to identify molecular and morphological features
associated with disease initiation, progression, and therapeutic response. Second, he will
continue to improve the CyCIF method and integrate it with other methods for spatial
interrogation of human and murine tumors (e.g. transcript profiling and imaging mass
spectrometry). Dr. Lin will also continue to lead an HTAN TNP designed to compare spatial
profiling methods across technologies and performance sites. This research has already led to
unexpected insights into adequately powering spatial profiles as well as the relative merits of
whole-slide 2D and 3D imaging. Third, he will continue to develop and validate new approaches
to tissue imaging, particularly those that are applicable to digital pathology workflows in the
setting of clinical trials and patient diagnosis. This builds on the proven ability of CyCIF to collect
high quality data from the formaldehyde-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens routinely
acquired for patient diagnosis and staging (including core biopsies and fine needle aspirates).
This combination of collaborative and original research and technology development is
expected to have a high impact on an emerging area of translational cancer biology and is fully
consistent with the roles expected of a laboratory-based R50 Research Specialist."

Sex differences are present in many pathological conditions, including a number of non-reproductive cancers. 
These differences have been observed from an epidemiolocal perspective, and mechanistic studies have 
revealed broad-ranging differences between sexes at the genetic, epigenetic, and cellular levels. In glioblastoma, 
the most common primary malignant brain tumor, males present with disease nearly twice as often as females 
and experience a poorer prognosis given the same standard-of-care treatments. As part of a current Program 
Project Grant (P01 CA245705), we are focused on the cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic influences of sex 
differences, as well as their interplay, in glioblastoma. These efforts have focused on multiple mechanisms, 
including sex differences in the immune response, and found differences in the resident (microglial) and 
infiltrating (namely myeloid-derived suppressor cell) immune populations. While these initial observations were 
made using transplantable mouse glioblastoma models generated from genetically engineered or carcinogen- 
induced mouse models and validated in human samples, these models are not strongly representative of the 
human disease, as they lack key drivers, including mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, 
namely EGFRvIII). Using in vivo electroporation approaches supported by the NCI IMAT program, more 
representative GBM models have been generated using Mosaic Analysis with Dual Recombinase (MADR) and 
Genome Editing of Synthetic Target Arrays for Lineage Tracing (GESTALT) technologies that leverage 
concomitant expression of key oncogenes such as EGFRvIII and deletion of key tumor suppressors such as 
NF1 and p53. The overall objective of this revision application is to enhance our program through the use of 
these more representative glioblastoma models to determine sex-specific immune response effects. In Aim 1, 
we will determine how the glioblastoma immune microenvironment is arranged as a function of the biological sex 
of the tumor. In parallel with these benchmarking studies, Aim 2 will take an unbiased, hypothesis-generating 
approach to determine how the neural cell composition of the tumor microenvironment is generated as a function 
of the biological sex of the developing glioblastoma. The MADR-GESTALT will be applied to wild-type mice, as 
well as Project 3-specific mouse models (junctional adhesion molecule-A) and the four-core genotype model that 
separates chromosomal and gonadal sex. The short-term goal of this application is to enhance Project 3 of our 
Program Project Grant and provide this new model for all projects through Core C, which houses experimental 
models. The long-term goal of this project is to leverage these more representative glioblastoma models for 
future functional and mechanistic studies on sex differences in glioblastoma."

 Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that has both fatal and non-fatal morbid consequences.
Unfortunately, initial survival does not provide relief from morbidity for most sepsis survivors. Initial clinical
trajectories include rapid recovery, early in-hospital death, and progression to chronic critical illness (ICU stay ≥
14 days with organ dysfunction). Late complications include sepsis recidivism and late death, both of which
have rates of approximately 40% at 90 days and 6 months, respectively. Circulating lipids play an important
role in sepsis and cholesterol levels of both high density lipoproteins (HDL-C) and low density lipoproteins
(LDL-C) are dynamically regulated in sepsis. HDL and LDL are both thought to play protective roles in sepsis
via several mechanisms (antioxidant/anti-inflammatory function, bacterial toxin clearance, steroid synthesis),
but the exact mechanisms by which HDL and LDL protect against sepsis are not known.
Lipid and lipoprotein dysregulation occurs in early sepsis, leading to failure to protect against sepsis. Our
published work has shown that in sepsis patients: 1) HDL is oxidized, becomes proinflammatory and
dysfunctional; 2) dysfunctional HDL correlates with and predicts organ failure severity; 3) HDL cholesterol
efflux (required for toxin clearance and steroid synthesis) is impaired in older septic patients compared to
healthy older controls; 4) HDL-C and LDL-C levels drop precipitously, and drop-severity predicts organ failure
and death; and 5) low LDL-C levels are associated with increased long-term sepsis risk. New preliminary data
in this grant revision also suggests that PON1, an HDL associated antioxidant protein, may play a critical
protective role in sepsis.
 A large gap in our knowledge of lipid and lipoprotein dysregulation in sepsis exists that prevents complete
understanding of previously observed lipid changes. We hypothesize that inflammatory, lipidomic, and
genomic changes in early sepsis result in dysregulated lipid and lipoprotein metabolism & altered lipid
function, oxidation and reduced levels that play a central role in sepsis pathobiology.
 This new investigator R01 application will allow Dr. Guirgis to further establish his laboratory and will
capitalize on biobanked samples from a diverse cohort of 165 sepsis patients (UF Jacksonville and UF
Gainesville) and will confirm findings in a small prospective cohort. This approach has several advantages: 1)
recent cohort of sepsis patients (2016-2018) treated with evidence-based management bundles, 2) availability
of serial samples (enrollment, 48-72h, 28d, and 90d) & stored leukocyte mRNA, 3) samples from matched
healthy control subjects, 4) detailed clinical and outcomes data, and 5) prospective enrollment of a small cohort
of sepsis patients for validation of findings. This project satisfies the NIGMS mission of researching biological
mechanisms that underlay the foundation for advances in treatment of diseases such as sepsis.

10812330,"Abstract
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the most effective treatments for patients with advanced Parkinson's
disease (PD). Delivery of high frequency electrical stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) ameliorates
parkinsonian motor symptoms, often within seconds, but therapeutic effects wear off quickly if stimulation is
stopped, often within minutes. This transient nature of symptomatic relief underscores the fact that existing DBS
protocols mask symptoms but do not alleviate underlying circuit dysfunction. A modified DBS protocol, called
coordinated reset (CR-DBS), has shown potential to provide long-lasting therapeutic benefits for days to weeks
after stimulation, but this protocol has been slow to translate into widespread clinical use because (1) the multi-
site, pseudorandom stimulation patterns required to implement it cannot be delivered with existing devices and
(2) its mechanisms of action remain obscure, hindering insights into what parameters of CR-DBS should be
tuned to ensure engagement of long-lasting effects. Recently, in a mouse model of PD, we discovered a cellular-
based strategy to induce long-lasting motor recovery, by using optogenetics to target interventions to specific
neuronal subpopulations in the external globus pallidus (GPe), an anatomical neighbor of the STN. Long-lasting
motor rescue was induced by interventions that simultaneously increased the firing rates of GPe neurons
enriched in parvalbumin (PV-GPe) and decreased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in lim homeobox 6
(Lhx6-GPe). Interestingly, at the physiological level, these cell-type specific interventions in the GPe converged
upon a similar mechanism as CR-DBS, by ameliorating pathological patterns of neural activity in basal ganglia
output nuclei that have been associated with parkinsonian motor deficits. This proposal will use knowledge
gained from our discovery of long-lasting rescue through cell-type directed interventions in GPe to guide
rational design and interrogation of human-applicable forms of DBS that may yield similarly long-lasting
therapeutic benefit. Our experiments will test a novel, mechanistic hypothesis, based on supporting preliminary
data, that the pattern of electrical DBS can be tuned to drive cell-type specific responses in the GPe that mirror
those previously found to be sufficient to induce of long-lasting motor rescue with optogenetics. Experiments in
Aim 1 will investigate the cellular mechanisms through which phasic stimulation in the STN evokes cell-type
specific responses in the GPe (Aim 1.1) and use a machine learning approach to identify stimulation protocols
that maximize this cell-type specific response (Aim 1.2). Experiments in Aim 2 will test the therapeutic efficacy
of phasic stimulation protocols compared to conventional DBS, using behavioral and physiological assays in
mouse (Aim 2.1) and primate (Aim 2.2) models of PD. Taken together, these experiments will advance our
understanding of the fundamental differences between how conventional vs. phasic stimulation impacts
the nervous system, with cell-type specific and synapse-specific resolution, and could provide novel
therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly translated into humans."
10812331,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder imposing an unbearable socio-
economic burden worldwide. Current therapeutic approaches fail to halt AD progression, indicating the need for
new strategies, which is the focus of this project. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)–the major pathological hallmark
in human AD and related tauopathies, occurs when microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT or tau) forms
aggregates. Further, accumulation of the tau aggregates in AD brain promotes cognitive decline, accompanied
with dysregulated proteostasis in neurons. However, we and others have previously shown that smaller soluble
tau-aggregates, called oligomers, are the most toxic species and form prior to NFTs in human AD. Our
preliminary studies show that AD-brain-derived tau oligomers (BDTOs) exhibit unique post-translational
modifications (PTMs), including specific ubiquitin-linkages, which seem to be involved in tau-aggregation that
influence stability, propagation in a prion-like manner and subsequent cognitive decline. Understanding the
fundamental signature ubiquitination pattern by which tau oligomers evade proteasomal degradation and
promote its assembly, stability, secretion and propagation is important for developing disease-modifying
therapies for AD.
This proposal will test the central hypothesis that the unique mono-ubiquitination of tau oligomers facilitate to
evade the neuronal ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and promote its accumulation in neurons, which
causes synaptic dysfunction. Furthermore, these tau oligomers contribute to increased neuronal toxicity,
secretion and propagation of a prion-like tau pathology, and also promote neuroinflammation by modulating
microglia and astrocytes activation. In specific aim 1, using mass-spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis,
we will define the mechanism and functional impact of lysine modification, and particularly reversible mono-
ubiquitination, in regulating the processing, assembly and trafficking of tau oligomers in neurons. This will also
define the biochemical and structural consequences of tau oligomer mono-ubiquitination in modulating the
efficacy of tau oligomer assembly, secretion and propagation in AD, which will serve as a potential AD
antemortem biomarker, and provide key information for targeting the pathological tau. Using isotope labeling by
amino acids in vitro and in vivo (SILAC) proteomics approaches, in specific aim 2, we will define the mechanism
by which mono-ubiquitination controls the interplay between PHF-tau assembly and tau oligomers secretion and
propagation in primary neurons. Further, physiological mechanisms for regulation of tau-deubiquitination and AD
pathogenesis will be verified using complementary approaches. In specific aim 3, we will investigate the role of
deubiquitinase Otub1 on tau oligomer accumulation, trafficking and self-propagation in neurons."
10811343,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 In aging HIV-infected populations comorbid diseases are important determinants of morbidity and mortality.
HIV patients die of non-AIDS comorbidities almost a decade earlier that their non-HIV counterparts. cART is
unable to eradicate HIV due to established HIV reservoirs. Mounting evidence suggests that exhaustion of the
latent viral reservoirs leads to either a complete cure (sterilizing cure) or a remission (functional cure). HIV
establishes reservoirs at several anatomical sites like peripheral blood, CNS, lung, etc. Gene therapy has shown
enormous promise but its application towards HIV cure is limited due to limitations like viral escape, off-target
effects and most importantly delivery and bioavailability to infected cells.
 Gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 has tremendous potential in HIV gene therapy and reports have shown
excision of HIV from infected cells. However, CRISPR based HIV excision is vulnerable to viral escape as well
as off-target effects. P-TEFb, a heterodimer of cyclinT1 and CDK9 is recruited by HIV Tat and plays a pivotal
role in releasing the elongation block to allow transcription to proceed from the HIV LTR. Interaction of Tat with
CyclinT1 is critical to recruit PTEF-b to turn ON HIV transcription, while CyclinT1 can be substituted by other
cyclins for cellular transcription. This criticality for HIV transcription and redundancy for cellular transcription
makes CyclinT1 an ideal cellular factor to block HIV with minimal effects on cellular transcription. Inhibition of
Cyclin T1 has been shown to completely inhibit HIV transcription. Hence a CRISPR mediated inactivation of
CyclinT1 will completely block HIV transcription, locking it in an inactive form in the cell thereby effecting a
functional cure. Effecting CRISPR-mediated CyclinT1 knockdown only in HIV infected cells provides an
additional insulation from any toxicity or off-target effects. We will restrict CyclinT1 knockdown only in infected
cells by co-expressing gRNA targeting Cyclin T1 along with Cas9 from a Pol II mono-promoter based single
transcription cassette using our patented LTR-hsp fusion promoter co-expression cassette. Expression is self-
limiting as the co-expression cassette is also dependent on HIV Tat-CyclinT1 interaction thereby preventing
generation of adaptive immune responses. Upon CyclinT1 knockdown, expression of gRNA and Cas9 will cease
from the fusion promoter. We will combine this specific expression with lentiviral vector based in vivo delivery
using a regimen that has demonstrated delivery and transduction of bone marrow stem cells and PBMCs. In Aim
1, will determine the efficacy of our self-limiting HIV inducible gRNA-Cas9 co-expression cassette to block and
lock HIV proviral transcription in primary cell models of infection and HIV latency. Aim2 we will test the
pharmacokinetics, toxicity and efficacy of lentiviral vector based in vivo delivery of our HIV inducible CRISPR
targeting CyclinT1 in small animal models of HIV infection and latency. This application responds to key
objectives of RFA-AI-20-076 by proposing “in vivo gene therapeutic strategies with selective regulation of genetic
payload expression to maximize on-target efficacy and minimize off-target effects.”"

Alcohol consumption adversely affects up to 28% of hospitalized patients and contributes to a loss of 133 million
disability-adjusted life years and 5.3% of worldwide deaths each year. As alcohol use has substantial health and
economic impact, much attention has been directed toward the numerous adverse health outcomes in patients
with unhealthy alcohol use. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) occurs on a spectrum from mild to severe and is
precipitated by binge drinking and heavy alcohol use. We and others have shown that AUD is a modifiable
perioperative risk factor and is present in up to 18% of surgical patients. Despite its significant clinical impact,
AUD is often overlooked in the design of perioperative care plans. Although AUD affects 9% of the US population,
less than one in ten individuals with AUD receives any treatment. Barriers to treatment are multiple and include
scarce care availability, limited access, and social stigma. Although anesthesiologists routinely provide guideline-
concordant treatment for non-operative medical conditions such as coronary artery disease, AUD-specific care
is rarely provided, even to high-risk patients. Thus, there is a compelling opportunity to integrate AUD screening
and treatment into routine perioperative care. Our central hypotheses are that AUD health services initiated in
the perioperative period will 1) leverage the significant resources made available to perioperative care in the US,
2) forge novel synergistic alliances between previously disconnected healthcare settings, and 3) break down
barriers to access to care for health disparity populations. A multi-institutional team of anesthesiologists,
biostatisticians, psychologists, and psychiatrists with expertise in AUD treatment and novel clinical trial designs
will lead the Leveraging Alcohol Use Disorder Screening for Treatment in Routine Perioperative
Care: AllUsCare proposal and proposes three aims: 1) Leverage our existing EHR-integrated Alcohol Use
Disorders Identification Test-Concise (AUDIT-C) screening tool to increase provision of AUD-specific
perioperative care, 2) Conduct a two-center prospective observational cohort study to assess patient
acceptability of interventions, feasibility of outcome data collection, and optimum outcome measures for a future
pragmatic trial, and 3) Optimize perioperative AUD intervention bundles most likely to be effective in a future
pragmatic randomized factorial cluster trial through a health equity lens. This R34 planning grant will lay the
groundwork for identifying the most effective health service intervention bundles in surgical patients at high risk
for AUD. To maximize inclusion of NIH health disparity populations, we will conduct our study in two centers that
serve inner-city and rural populations and will deliberately include patients aged 12 years and older. At the
conclusion of AllUsCare, we will have established the research team, designed an AUD intervention bundle most
likely to be effective in a future multi-center pragmatic trial, demonstrated a single-IRB governed uniform data
collection and entry process, and confirmed the acceptability and feasibility of the future pragmatic trial."
10811346,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Ionizing radiation causes double strand breaks and damages the protein-based mechanisms responsible for
their repair. This makes mitotic cells in the bone marrow, gut and reproductive organs highly susceptible to
ionizing radiation damage. In addition, as humans age, we become more susceptible to the effects of radiation
likely due to inherent accumulated cellular damage we accrue over time. There are very few pharmaceutical
countermeasures approved for mitigation of acute radiation damage, and none are effective for prophylactic
intervention. Given the use of nuclear power plants, the proliferation of nuclear arms and increased global
interest in space flight with its concomitant cosmic ray exposure, there is a pressing need to identify medicinal
sources of radioprophylactics.
Fungi are sources of diverse and powerful pharmaceuticals, and many strains of fungi are remarkably
radioresistant. Various fungi have been found growing in the heavily irradiated environments of the Chernobyl
Nuclear Power Plant and the International Space Station. To meet the growing need for radioprophylactics, we
seek to determine the radioprotective efficacy of dietary administration of highly radiation-resistant non-
pathogenic fungi. Drosophila are natural fungivores. In addition, Drosophila are an excellent model system in
which to study the damaging effect of radiation exposure on various organ systems since they share many
similarities with vertebrates yet are easily manipulated with sophisticated genetics and cell biology. We
hypothesize that consumption of these fungal strains will increase resistance to acute radiation damage
through known and unidentified factors. To do this, we will feed three Drosophila genotypes a panel of highly
radioresistant fungi. In addition to wild type flies, we will also test whether radioresistant fungi confer
radiation resistance to two mutant Drosophila strains that accumulate oxidative damage. To test our
hypothesis, we propose a single Aim. We will exposure the flies to gamma irradiation and test if the selected
dietary fungi confer radioprotection to lifespan, the gastrointestinal tract, the ovary, and various biomolecules.
We expect to find a radioprotective effect of dietary radioresistant fungi at one or several levels of our studies
from organismal to molecular. Knowledge gained from this research will open the opportunity to screen
hundreds of fungi using a relatively simple method. Once protective fungal strains are identified, future studies
can test their effectiveness in vertebrates, as well as identify the molecules responsible."
10811373,"ABSTRACT
Background: The use of cannabis is growing in older adults but there is very limited high quality
information on the acute effects of cannabinoids in healthy older adults. As the legalization of cannabis
continues to increase globally, the age range of individuals using cannabis across the lifespan continues to
expand, and the aging population continues to increase. Recent statistics indicate an increase in recreational
cannabis use by 75% and higher use of medical cannabis in older adults compared to younger adults3,4. As the
baby boomer generation grows older and the legal status of cannabis changes globally, the use of cannabis by
older individuals is projected to continue to grow5. The acute effects of cannabis in older individuals could be
different due to important age-related cognitive and physiological differences. First, the target of THC, the
endocannabinoid (eCB) system, changes across the lifespan. Second, age-related reductions in cognitive
reserve could make older adults more susceptible to the cognitive-impairing effects of cannabinoids. Third, the
aging brain may be less reward-driven6. Fourth, given the cardiovascular risks of cannabinoids7, age-related
reductions in cardiovascular reserve could place older adults at greater cardiovascular risk. Finally, age-related
changes in metabolism8 could impact the response to cannabinoids.
Hypotheses: Increasing age will confer greater vulnerability to THC-induced cognitive impairments, anxiogenic
effects, and cardiovascular effects but are less vulnerability to its rewarding effects. Increasing age will confer
greater vulnerability to THC-induced deficits in electrophysiological indices of information processing including.
Pilot data: Older (>50 years old, n = 4) adults are more vulnerable to the acute memory-impairing and anxiogenic
effects of THC than younger adults (<25 years, n = 5).
Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, hybrid fixed-order/randomized, single test day laboratory
study 60 adults ( 21 years) will receive 0 (placebo) and 0.03 mg/kg of intravenous THC over 20 minutes.
Cognitive function (memory, attention, etc.) and proximal measures of attention and information processing (EEG
measures, including P300, ASSR, and neural noise) will be tested after the administration of THC/placebo.
Subjective effects, perceptual alterations, vital signs, objective measures of information processing (EEG), and
blood for PK will be collected before and after the administration of THC."
10813151,"Mammalian early embryogenesis is a fundamental question in biology. Recent studies
have demonstrated that global remodeling of chromatin structure plays a critical role in acquiring
and maintaining toti- or pluri-potency. Although their exact function remains elusive,
endogenous transposable elements (TEs), remnants of ancient transposons, are associated
with dynamic chromatin remodeling in early embryogenesis. Furthermore, although trophoblast
stem cells (TSCs) play essential roles in supporting embryonic development, little is known
about their chromatin structure. TEs plays an essential role in the acquirement of placenta in
eutherians during evolution. Intriguingly, the specification of the trophoblast lineage occurs when
traditional epigenetic marks reaches the lowest point, indicative of the existence of novel
mechanisms.
 DNA methylation is a critical factor in the regulation of chromatin structures. A series of
recent studies, including ours, have discovered a novel type of DNA methylation, N6-
methyladenine (N6-mA), in metazoans. In general, N6-mA is expressed at very low levels in
adult mammalian tissues and can be upregulated under environmental stress or in
tumorigenesis. N6-mA levels are greatly elevated in early embryogenesis in various metazoans,
including mammals. Interestingly, we and others also demonstrated the specific role of N6-mA
in silencing TEs in mouse embryonic stem cells, brains and human tumor cells. Our most
recent results demonstrated a surprising function of N6-mA in promoting dynamic chromatin
structures in stem cells thereby promoting the stem cell fate (TSCs), via stabilizing DNA
secondary structure at TEs. This proposal aims to further investigate this novel mechanism.
The outcome of this proposal will pave the way to a new research direction in epigenetics and
embryogenesis."
10813152,"Project Summary/Abstract
In melanoma, loss of function mutations in NF1 are the third most common oncogenic alteration after activating
mutations in BRAF and NRAS. The RAS GTPase-activating protein NF1 provides negative feedback from the
MAPK pathway to RAS by binding to SPRED1 at the plasma membrane where it is inactivates RAS-GTP. We
recently discovered recurrent inactivating mutations of SPRED1 in melanoma, occurring in a mutually
exclusive pattern with inactivating NF1 mutations, consistent with their functional overlap. Inactivation of either
tumor suppressor often co-occurs with additional MAPK activating mutations such as activating mutations of
KIT. We hypothesize that NF1 or SPRED1 inactivation may reduce the efficacy of therapeutic inhibition of KIT
and similar gain of function alterations in the MAPK pathway. The objective of this research is to identify the
spectrum of additional MAPK activating alterations that occur in the setting of NF1 or SPRED1 loss and to
determine the role of NF1 or SPRED1 in melanoma progression and response to targeted therapies. Our
central hypothesis is that NF1 or SPRED1 loss increases MAPK signaling but that full malignant transformation
requires additional alterations that feed into the MAPK pathway. We will catalogue the spectrum of cooperators
that form oncogenic pairs with NF1 or SPRED1 inactivation and validate their contributions to tumorigenicity
both in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that identifying oncogenic pairs and developing therapeutic strategies
that address both members of a pair will lead to improved outcomes for patients. We will provide proof of
principle for this concept by building on our preliminary data that dual inhibition of KIT and MEK are synergistic
for melanomas with an oncogenic pair consisting of KIT mutation and NF1 or SPRED1 loss. We will test
combination therapies in genetically engineered human melanoma cell lines and mouse models. We will also
investigate the direct physical interaction between KIT and SPRED1, which may lead to additional avenues for
inhibiting melanomas with KIT or SPRED1 mutations. This work will provide a framework for similar studies for
other cooperators of NF1 and SPRED1. This research is significant since it will lead to novel therapies for a
significant number of melanoma patients for whom targeted therapies are not currently available. The
proposed research is innovative because it tests a novel hypothesis why treatment of mutations such as KIT
have limited efficacy in melanoma. Shedding light onto the complex signaling pathway perturbations in the
considerable share of melanomas with NF1 or SPRED1 will have a considerable impact for patients with
melanomas for which treatment options are currently limited."
10813174,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION)
Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the
US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking
cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s
SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely
available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit
rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to
address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for
smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now
making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered
digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations.
CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and
advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major
knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also
unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA
for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized
controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible
with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the
three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps
and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled
trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine
whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes
significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs.
SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness
of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of
research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general—
regardless of whether the results are positive or null. Positive results could have high population-level impact
and stimulate new lines of research into CA dissemination and implementation, and the adaptation of CAs for
multiple subpopulations of smokers, languages, and community and medical settings."
10813175,"ABSTRACT
Biliary epithelial cells (BECs; also called as cholangiocytes) that line the hepatic biliary tree control bile
composition and flow. Injury to the BECs leads to cholestasis, which can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver
failure. Cholestatic liver diseases are associated with high morbidity and mortality; however, few effective
therapies are available. In fact, liver transplantation is the only life-extending treatment for end-stage cholestatic
liver diseases, but the shortage of donor livers makes this therapy extremely limited. In the injured liver with
biliary damage, hepatocytes (HCs) can contribute to BECs to recover from the loss of BECs. Recent studies in
mice have shown that HC-derived BECs contribute to the intrahepatic bile ducts, thereby restoring appropriate
bile flow. Patients with biliary obstruction or cholangiopathies also exhibit biliary marker expression in HCs,
suggesting their reprogramming into BECs. Thus, augmenting innate HC-to-BEC reprogramming in cholestatic
liver diseases is an attractive therapeutic alternative to ameliorate cholestasis and subsequent cirrhosis. To
develop such a therapy, it is crucial to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying HC-to-BEC
reprogramming. Furthermore, identifying small molecules that can augment the reprogramming should provide
promising therapeutic drugs for patients with cholestatic liver diseases. Our long-term goal is to completely
delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying HC-to-BEC reprogramming. As a first step in pursuit of that goal,
the objective of this proposal is to determine the cellular and molecular characteristics of HC-to-BEC
reprogramming-driven biliary regeneration in our two innovative zebrafish models and to elucidate how histone
deacetylase 1 (hdac1) regulates HC-to-BEC reprogramming. Based on our preliminary data obtained from
pharmacological and genetic studies, we hypothesize that Hdac1 inhibition promotes HC-to-BEC reprogramming
by derepressing the Notch receptor gene notch2 and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 gene
(stat3). We will test this hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this application by (1) elucidating the entire
process of HC-to-BEC reprogramming-driven biliary regeneration in the two zebrafish models, in which complete
absence of BECs is achieved and subsequently HCs convert to BECs. (Aim 1), (2) determining the effects of
Hdac1 inhibition on HC-to-BEC reprogramming in both zebrafish and mice (Aim 2), and (3) elucidating the
molecular mechanisms by which Hdac1 inhibition promotes the reprogramming (Aim 3). The successful
accomplishment of the proposed research will not only provide novel molecular mechanisms underlying HC-to-
BEC reprogramming but also suggest HDAC1/2 inhibitors as promising therapeutic drugs to promote the
reprogramming in patients with cholestatic liver diseases."
10784870,"Research confirms that patient outcomes improve when healthcare providers practice in an evidence-based manner. Evidence-based practice (EBP) involves a problem-solving approach to clinical care that incorporates the conscientious use of current best practices from well-designed studies, a clinician's expertise, and patient values and preferences. EBP has been shown to increase patient safety, improve clinical outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and decrease variation in patient outcomes. The importance of EBP is substantiated; however, significant barriers to widespread use of current evidence to inform decision-making remain, including the lack of access to published research. 
Publisher paywalls limit access to approximately 75% of the published biomedical literature. That represents a massive amount of information being withheld from physicians who lack subscriptions to the content. This notable disparity in health information access presents an opportunity to democratize information access by providing all physicians in the state with the means to acquire the evidence necessary to support clinical decision-making. This ideal aligns with NLM’s strategic goal to reach more people in more ways through enhanced dissemination and engagement.
In pursuit of that objective, the Eccles Health Sciences Library (EHSL) at the University of Utah has devised a pathway that enables licensed physicians across the state to retrieve full-text articles from PubMed without encountering a publisher paywall. By removing one of the obstacles to information access that disproportionally affects physicians (and their patients) in rural and under-served areas in the state, EHSL seeks to minimize disparities in health information access by healthcare providers in Utah.
This project will eliminate the barrier of publisher paywalls as an impediment to EBP and be guided by the following aims: Aim 1: To increase access to usable health information for Utah physicians, particularly those in rural areas with high health disparity populations. Aim 2: To solicit feedback regarding the impact of expanded health information access on physicians’ ability to provide evidence-based care. Aim 3: To evaluate the suitability and sustainability of a subsidized article delivery service in PubMed as a means of alleviating the unequal access to information experienced by Utah physicians. 
This proposal’s significance and opportunity for change is exemplified by the fact that most Utah physicians have limited access to the published biomedical literature. If proven effective, our approach can be replicated or adapted in other locations where physician health information access disparities need to be addressed."
10813727,"Project Summary
Accumulating evidence in humans and in animal models indicates that inflammation of the brain that
develops after status epilepticus (SE) may play a determinant role in long-term detrimental consequences,
independent of an infection or auto-immune cause. The pathophysiological interactions among the various
inflammatory molecules, and the sequence of events leading to their induction, have not yet been dissected.
Previous work pointed to a role for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathways in SE-induced inflammation, and
showed that the EP2 receptor mediates much of the COX-2 effect. Our recent work suggests that PGE2
released from neurons after SE activates EP2 receptors on nearby neurons and myeloid cells, and that EP2
activation on neurons and myeloid cells might cause opposing effects. We hypothesize that EP2 activation
on neurons after SE is neuroprotective, whereas EP2 activation on microglia or invading monocytes results
in cytokine synthesis and subsequent development of epilepsy. Here we use a novel HaloTag technology to
target neurons and myeloid cells separately with EP2 antagonists and agonists to test this hypothesis. Our
specific aims are: 1. To test the hypothesis that pharmacologic block of EP2 receptors on neurons and
myeloid cells has opposing effects after SE. 2. To test the hypothesis that blocking EP2 receptors on myeloid
cells interferes with the process of epileptogenesis. 3. To test the hypothesis that EP2-mediated
neuroprotection involves neuronal EP2 receptors, utilizes a cAMP rather than β-arrestin pathway, and
requires CX3CL1 (fractalkine). To address these aims we employ in vitro culture models and in vivo SE
models with novel EP2 antagonists and agonists targeted by HaloTag to neurons or microglia.
Immunohistochemical, western blot, qRT-PCR, cell viability, EEG and behavioral assays are performed."
10815549,"Targeting the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer and has been
validated by the FDA approval of the Bcl-2 selective inhibitor, venetoclax, for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Given the well-documented importance of Bcl-xL to many
types of cancers, including most T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and its contribution to drug
resistance, Bcl-xL has become one of the best validated cancer targets. Unfortunately, the on-target and dose-
limiting platelet toxicity associated with the inhibition of Bcl-xL has prevented the use of Bcl-xL inhibitors in the
clinic. To circumvent this toxicity, we have applied the Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology to
design small-molecules that target Bcl-xL to E3 ligases for degradation. Our hypothesis is that Bcl-xL degrading
PROTACs (named as Bcl-Ps) designed to recruit an E3 ligase that is minimally expressed in platelets for the
targeted degradation of Bcl-xL will have reduced platelet toxicity and improved antitumor activity compared with
their corresponding Bcl-xL inhibitors. This hypothesis is supported by our strong preliminary results, including in
vivo efficacy data in T-ALL patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models and other tumor xenograft mouse
models. In addition, our Bcl-Ps are also potent senolytic agents that can selectively kill senescent cells (SnCs),
because SnCs also rely on Bcl-xL for survival. Clearance of chemotherapy-induced SnCs is considered as a
novel strategy to prevent or reduce many short- and long-term adverse effects of the chemotherapeutic drugs,
as well as cancer relapse and metastasis. Collectively, these findings suggest that Bcl-Ps are superior to
conventional Bcl-xL inhibitors as anticancer agents. The goal of this application is to: (1) optimize Bcl-Ps for
improved potency, selectivity, drug-like properties, and in vivo efficacy; (2) evaluate the new Bcl-Ps through a
series of in vitro and in vivo assays; and (3) evaluate the preclinical efficacy of lead Bcl-Ps in T-ALL PDX models.
Upon completion of this project, we aim to produce Bcl-Ps amenable to further evaluation in clinical trials for T-
ALL, an aggressive leukemia that currently has no targeted therapies."
10815558,"Abstract
Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), a life-threatening illness with multi-system involvement in a subset of infected individuals. Oral and
nasopharyngeal (NP) epithelial cells express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2, and infection of the
oral/nasopharyngeal cavity (ONP) is likely an obligate step in the development of COVID-19. Immune responses
first generated in the ONP are almost certainly crucial for viral clearance but may also play a central role in the
development of hyperinflammatory injury observed in many infected individuals. We have used single cell (sc)-
RNA sequencing from a racially diverse prospective cohort of COVID-19 patients to identify distinct subsets of
ciliated epithelial cells within the NP that are direct targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection and have described innate
anti-viral responses generated by those cells within both directly infected as well as non-infected bystander cells.
Interestingly this analysis demonstrates that increased mortality is linked to blunted anti-viral gene response in
the NP, suggesting that a successful innate response to viral infection in the nose is a critical component of a
successful anti-viral response. In addition to the nose, there is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the
oral epithelium. While there are several anatomic sites within the mouth that are likely involved in anti-viral
responses, the gingival sulcus is a unique immunologically active location that is crucial for maintaining oral
health. The gingival epithelium expresses both the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 as well as the host protease
TMPRSS2 necessary for viral entry, but exhibits important immunological differences compared to the nasal
epithelium including a bias towards IL-17 associated neutrophil responses. Thus, our overall hypothesis is that
identifying and enhancing successful innate and adaptive cellular immune responses of the nasal and gingival
epithelium will lead to novel therapeutic avenues for COVID-19. To address this hypothesis, propose the
following aims: 1. Stratify cell states and viral dynamics across mucosal surfaces following SARS-CoV-2
infection and vaccination; 2. Compare memory T cell responses within the nose and gingiva that are associated
with successful or pathogenic responses to SARS-CoV-2; and 3. Characterize the regulation of host innate
immune defense mechanisms that are essential to limit propagation of SARS-CoV-2 infection within ONP
epithelial cells. To accomplish these aims, we will analyze human ONP samples from individuals with COVID-
19, recovered from COVID-19, and vaccinated for COVID-19 using sc-RNA-seq, flow cytometry, and other
molecular biology techniques. At completion, the project will define the protective innate and adaptive immune
mechanisms operating in the ONP of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, improve our overall understanding of
viral induced immunity in the ONP, and provide insight into how these pathways influence disease pathogenesis."
10800825,"Although new treatments have improved outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), disability remains
high, most patients have ongoing disease activity, and lasting remissions are rare. A major gap
in the field is the elusive identity of pathogenic cells driving persistent inflammation and bone
erosion. Our lab focuses on the identification of pathogenic B cell subsets in RA, which might
drive persistent and aggressive disease. We reported that B cells promote bone erosion by
RANKL/TNF-mediated differentiation of monocytes to osteoclasts (OCs) and TNF/CCL3-
mediated inhibition of osteoblasts (OBs). Importantly, synovial B cells express much higher levels
of these bone pathogenic factors. More recently, we identified a subset of B cells expressing the
classic T cell lineage defining transcription factor T-bet enriched in the RA synovium and
correlating with disease severity and the abundance of SLAMF7 pro-inflammatory monocytes.
We find that synovial T-bet B cells express cytokines influencing OCs/OBs, SLAMF7, and the T-
bet inducible chemokine receptor CXCR3. Remarkably, mouse B cells lacking T-bet did not
activate OCs or inhibit OBs. Based on our results, the central goal of this proposal is to define
how T-bet influences synovial B cell states, mediates B cell-driven bone effects on OCs/OBs, and
coordinates B cell pathogenic functions in RA target tissue, contributing to joint erosion and
synovial inflammation. We hypothesize that T-bet promotes pathogenic B cell functions in the RA
synovium via acquisition of a pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine program that orchestrates
CXCR3-dependent B cell migration to the synovium and enhances SLAMF7-dependent
monocyte activation and bone erosion. We will use deeply characterized RA patient cohorts, high-
resolution single cell transcriptomic and spatial analysis of joint target tissue, and novel animal
models to track T bet B cells and selectively and conditionally delete T-bet in B cells of mice with
collagen induced arthritis. The combination of preclinical and translational studies will facilitate
the mechanistic interrogation of T-bet B cell functions in RA via 3 SAs: 1) Determine the
mechanisms by which B cell T-bet promotes RA joint erosion; 2) Assess how T-bet B cells impact
RA synovial monocyte activation; 3) Examine the role of T-bet in B cells during inflammatory-
erosive arthritis in mice. By detailing the functional impact of T-bet B cells, innovative treatments
targeting their activity may be a novel path towards preventing bone erosion and conferring lasting
clinical remissions."

Obesity increases the risk of numerous cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC). With the growing global
epidemic of obesity, a greater understanding of the obesity cancer-link, including its underlying biology and its
adverse influence on patient outcomes is critically needed. Our ability to treat patients optimally has been
hampered, in part, by the traditional use of body mass index (BMI) to define obesity. BMI fails to take into
account important dimensions of body composition, such as fat distribution (e.g., visceral obesity) and muscle
mass (e.g., sarcopenia). A clinically applicable approach to characterizing obesity and body composition
combined with an understanding of CRC-obesity biology will advance our ability to tailor treatments and
interventions to disrupt the adverse impacts of obesity on treatment toxicity and patient outcomes. We propose
an interdisciplinary study that addresses both gaps in knowledge by (1) application of a cutting-edge artificial
intelligence (AI)-powered, fully automated CT scan-based platform to generate accurate, individualized
volumetric measures of adipose tissue compartments/skeletal muscle mass and (2) testing the role of
thromboinflammation, a novel biologic pathway to investigate in the context of obesity-CRC outcomes.
Thromboinflammation, a state characterized by increased platelet activation and systemic and tumor-specific
sequelae, plays a role in metastasis and has recently, but separately, been associated with obesity and
cancer; however, it has never before been investigated as a biological interface and potential target of
intervention in the obesity-CRC link.
 Our study leverages a unique resource of longitudinal CT images, clinical data, tumor, plasma, and urine
from a population of N=1,200 stage I-III CRC patients enrolled in the NCI-funded ColoCare Study. In Aim 1,
we will apply a novel AI-powered fully automated radiologic 3D body segmentation software to generate robust
volumetric adiposity and muscle mass profiles and examine associations with treatment-related toxicity and
clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will examine thromboinflammation biomarkers in blood, urine, and tumor in
relation to visceral obesity and survival outcomes and test whether this pathway mediates Aim 1 associations.
Together, we will discern differences by race and other factors (e.g., age, sex, stage, and tumor site)
 The proposed project takes a powerful and rigorous team science approach to address key questions on
the impact of body composition and adiposity-promoted thromboinflammation on CRC treatment-related
toxicities and survival. Use of a single, large, study patient population with an exceptional set of uniformly
available CT scans, data, and biospecimens is cost-effective and maximally informative. Our study will not only
yield clinically meaningful prognostic measures of body composition and thromboinflammation but will also
provide insights into obesity-CRC biology with the potential to identify novel personalized treatment strategies."
10801956,"Project Summary/Abstract: Alterations in the immune system occur with aging, likely contributing to
infections and malignancies. In T cells, probably the most prominent change with aging is memory T cell
expansion. A possible mechanism for this finding is immune stimulation over a lifetime. The nucleotide binding
domain and leucine-rich-repeat-containing (NLR) protein X1 or NLRX1 located in mitochondria is a negative
regulator of multiple inflammatory pathways including the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), NLR pyrin
domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, and NF-κB signaling. Our published and preliminary studies
support the possible implication of NLRX1 in aging. Aging induced the reduction of NLRX1 in murine lungs.
The lungs from whole body NLRX1 null mutant (-/-) or knockout (KO) mice revealed increased lung compliance,
a key feature of the “aging lung”8. Of interest, we found decreased expression of NLRX1 in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of older adults, raising the implication of NLRX1 in immune aging. Indeed, the
NLRX1 KO mice have changes in T cell immunity known to occur with aging. These changes include an
expansion of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased naïve T cell survival and IL-2 production, increased T
cell exhaustion molecules and effector cytokine IFN-γ. Our RNA-seq analysis on effector memory (EM) CD4+ T
cells of WT and NLRX1 KO mice highlighted an aging-like change in the global gene expression profile in
NLRX1 KO mice, implying the role of NLRX1 in altering T cell immunity with aging. This point is further
supported by noticing well-known age-associated changes in NLRX1 KO mice, including reduced
mitochondrial mass, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and SIRT1 as well as enhanced mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species (ROS), mTOR activation, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) expression and
cellular exhaustion which are mechanistically linked. However, our understanding remains poor about how
NLRX1 plays in altering T cell immunity in the context of aging biology and whether such changes can be
restored by increasing NLRX1 in aged hosts. Here we address this question based on the hypotheses that
decreased NLRX1 augments T cell aging by mechanistically affecting a set of aging-associated molecules (i.e.,
mitochondrial ROS, NAD+, SIRT1, and mTOR) and that such aging-associated changes can be improved by
restoring NLRX1 expression in old mice. The goal of our proposal is to test these hypotheses with the following
specific aims: 1) Aim 1. Elucidate the mechanism of how NLRX1 deficiency alters T cell characteristics,
especially ones related to immune aging; 2) Aim 2. Elucidate the implication of mitochondrial ROS and NAD+
in inducing T cell immunity changes via affecting mTOR activity in NLRX1 KO mice; and 3) Aim 3. Elucidate
whether restoration of NLRX1 in vivo can attenuate aging-associated changes in T cell immunity. The results
of our study will reveal a novel mechanism of T cell aging in the setting of decreased NLRX1, providing a
potential anti-aging strategy by restoring NLRX1."

Tuberculosis remains a major global health burden with ~1.6 million deaths in 2021 and a latently-infected
population of billions. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent, is a sophisticated pathogen which can
persist for decades in the human host and which requires lengthy treatment for cure with multiple antibiotics.
One of the features of M. tuberculosis is its ability to survive and replicate inside human cells, including
macrophages, one of the normal host defense mechanisms against infection. Intracellular bacteria are a specific
population which can be hard to kill, in part due to the requirement that molecules enter eukaryotic cells, and in
part due to the different physiological state in which the bacteria persist. Increasing evidence points to a higher
level of antibiotic tolerance in intracellular bacteria, as well as increased heterogeneity.
In order to identify new drugs which can shorten therapy, we focused on the identification of novel anti-tubercular
agents which are active against intracellular bacteria. We identified a number of scaffolds which inhibit
mycobacterial intracellular replication using a high content screen to monitor bacterial and eukaryotic cell survival
simultaneously. From these, we selected high priority series with attractive properties for further evaluation.
The overall aims of this proposal are to (i) evaluate a high priority chemical series with intracellular activity, (ii)
identify the target and mechanism of action of this novel series and (iii) determine the best companion agents
for a new regimen. The major outcome will be a molecule series with a known mechanism of action with in vivo
validation ready for lead optimization."

Despite advances in tobacco smoking cessation interventions (pharmacological and behavioral), most
smokers do not succeed at quitting, creating a major public health burden. Stress is one of the most
commonly reported precipitants of tobacco craving and relapse. Tobacco withdrawal is associated with
escalation of negative affect symptoms; our research has found multiple stress-related physiological and
hormonal alterations during withdrawal that predict relapse. Modifying these stress-related biobehavioral
changes may prove useful in reducing effects of stress. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid of
cannabis with low abuse liability that has received increased attention in the retail market and cannabis
research. Although CBD is aggressively marketed for addressing stress, little research has been done to
characterize CBD’s physiological and mood effects, their implications in managing tobacco withdrawal
symptoms, and the mechanism by which CBD may influence these symptoms. Our research will address
these timely issues. This application builds on our current and previous funding periods (PI: al’Absi,
R01DA027232) demonstrating that stress-related hormonal changes during tobacco withdrawal predict
relapse. We have shown that tobacco dependence is linked with: 1) enhanced basal hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenocortical (HPA) activity; 2) blunted cortisol response to multiple stressors; 3) disrupted opioid
regulation of the stress response; 4) association of attenuated stress response and early relapse; and 5)
sex differences in changes during withdrawal and predictors of relapse; hormonal responses are better
predictors of relapse in men, while withdrawal symptoms and craving are stronger predictors of relapse in
women. Our recent research has also documented blunted emotion regulation among cannabis users. In
the new cycle, we plan to conduct a multi-site, multi-group, multi-dose, double blind, within-subject study.
We will address the following specific aims: 1) Determine the acute effect of CBD on the psychobiological
mechanisms of the stress response in healthy participants; 2) Examine how tobacco dependence influences
the acute effect of CBD on psychobiological mechanisms of the stress response; 3) Determine the effect of
CBD on tobacco withdrawal-related changes in psychobiological mechanisms of the stress response in
tobacco users; 4) Explore sex differences in the psychobiological mechanisms of the stress response and
acute effects of CBD in dependent tobacco users. This research is the first to examine CBD's effect during
exposure to acute stress and tobacco withdrawal using relevant measures that are known to be sensitive to
acute stress and to tobacco withdrawal. The research builds on important preliminary results and uses
rigorous, reproducible procedures."
10804267,"Many human diseases are caused by faulty genes. The best way to treat them is by gene therapy, a
concept that has been around for over four decades. One of the major challenges of gene therapy is the lack of
reliable technologies to deliver healthy gene copies to target cells. Some commonly used delivery approaches
include viral vectors or nucleic acids coated with lipid-based nanoparticles, but their success in clinical
applications, particularly for gene therapy is limited. The revolutionary CRISPR-Cas gene editing system,
developed about a decade ago, offers a solution, but it too suffers from the delivery problem. A recent report
uncovered a surprising inter cellular mRNA transfer process, termed SEND (for selective endogenous
encapsidation for cellular delivery; Segel et al., Science: V373; 6557, p882), which provides an elegant solution
to the delivery problem. The SEND system utilizes a cellular protein, PEG10, which has the ability to form a
capsid-like protein coat on its own mRNA. PEG10 viral-like particles (VLPs) containing cargo (either Peg10
mRNA itself or an engineered heterologous mRNA), coated with another protein called fusogen, exit cells and
attach to other cells, delivering their cargo. Our preliminary results show that the SEND-VLP system works in
vivo in mice.
 While this initial work demonstrates the power of the SEND system for gene-therapy applications, the
real potential of SEND—as a much-needed delivery tool—could be exploited once we understand more about
the biogenesis of VLPs in mammalian tissues and their role in development, physiology, and pathology. The
task of systematic in vivo investigation of this newly discovered phenomenon requires the development of a
variety of carefully designed genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). Specifically, we have conceived
a suite of GEMMs having inducible and conditional potential to produce VLPs in a tissue of choice or at a
specified time in the mouse lifespan, including aging, as well as in disease conditions including fetal diseases
(applicable for Intra Uterine Gene Therapy; IUGT). As part of this award, we have selected three prototypes of
GEM models suitable for SEND-VLP research—one each for understanding the physiology of intercellular mRNA
transfer, for delivering CRISPR-Cas9 tools to a target tissue (e.g., liver) to treat genetic diseases in adult mouse
and for IUGT to treat fetal diseases. One of the major advantages of the SEND system is that it uses
endogenous proteins and therefore it is thought to be non-immunogenic and non-toxic. Once we learn more
about the SEND-VLP system, it could be re-purposed as a gene therapy tool to apply for numerous human
diseases for which there are on-going clinical trials that rely on viral vectors or nano-formulations; the
drawbacks of which are immunogenicity and toxicity. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to repurpose the
SEND system as a delivery tool for gene therapy."
10804275,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With the identification of hundreds of genes associated with autism spectrum and related neurodevelopmental
disorders (ASD/NDD), there is a pressing need to define the molecular pathways these genes contribute to in the
nervous system and to dissect how their disruption alters brain function to drive disease. Methylation of cytosines in
DNA classically occurs at CG dinucleotides in mammalian cells, serving as an epigenetic mark often associated with
gene repression. However, a unique form of non-CG DNA methylation that occurs primarily at CA dinucleotides
(mCA) is highly enriched in neurons and has emerged as an essential regulatory modification needed to tune
neuronal transcriptomes. Notably, this DNA mark is susceptible to disruption due to mutation of the ASD/NDD gene
DNMT3A, as well as the Rett syndrome methyl-DNA-binding protein MeCP2, suggesting that the specialized
neuronal DNA methylation pathway may be vulnerable to disruption across additional causes of ASD/NDD. In recent
studies, we have uncovered new mechanisms that govern the patterning of mCA in neurons and identified key
functional outputs for the neuronal DNA methylation pathway in regulating cell-type-specific transcriptomes. We have
shown that the histone H3 lysine 36 dimethyl mark (H3K36me2) is necessary for targeting DNMT3A to deposit mCA
and demonstrated that mutation of the ASD/NDD-associated gene, NSD1, disrupts this histone mark, leading to
altered neuronal DNA methylation. We have further uncovered evidence that mCA deposited by the NSD1-
H3K36me2-DNMT3A cascade is read out by MeCP2 in a cell-type specific manner to control expression of genes
that define neuronal subtype-specific transcriptomes. In our proposed studies we will build on these findings to
investigate the mechanisms of DNMT3A targeting by H3K36me2 and assess their potential disruption due to
additional genetic lesions in ASD/NDD (Aim 1). We will then dissect the cell-type specific epigenetic consequences
of perturbing the NSD1-H3K36me2-DNMT3A cascade in NSD1 mutant mice (Aim 2). Finally, we will employ cutting-
edge spatial transcriptomic technologies to probe gene dysregulation caused by mutations in the neuronal DNA
methylation pathway across more than a hundred subtypes of neuronal and non-neuronal cells with single-cell spatial
resolution (Aim 3). Together these studies are significant because they will define new roles for ASD/NDD-associated
factors in the neuronal DNA methylation pathway and explore how disruption of these factors can alter neuronal
function. Furthermore, our implementation of spatial transcriptomic analysis for the study of ASD/NDD will provide
systematic understanding of the transcriptomic impacts caused by disease-associated mutations in this pathway at
the highest level of resolution."
10803947,"Despite therapeutic advances, the 5-year survival rate from metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has
not improved significantly for 30 years. As such, significant benefits to patients with advanced breast cancer will
result by developing novel therapies, which target advanced metastatic breast cancer. To address this need we
screened metastatic cancers for genes which could contribute to metastasis. From this screen we identified
MDA-9/Syntenin-1/Sydecan Binding Protein (MDA-9) as a regulator of cancer cell metastasis. Published and
preliminary studies using several mouse models of metastasis confirm that inhibiting MDA-9 prevents metastasis
and sensitizes progressive metastatic tumors to chemotherapies leading to improved survival. These results
support the hypothesis: that targeting MDA-9 with inhibitors will lead to a combinatorial therapeutic approach
that simultaneously inhibits both the dissemination and growth/survival of progressive TNBC. We developed an
effective small molecule inhibitor of MDA-9 called PDZ1i. Administering PDZ1i in several mouse models of
metastatic cancers effectively prevents metastasis and sensitizes metastatic tumors to chemotherapies,
supporting our hypothesis. In this application. we propose experiments to better understand how PDZ1i exerts
anti-tumor/metastatic effects and if this information can be used to make PDZ1i a better chemotherapy. In
Specific Aim 1, we seek to formulate PDZ1i for clinical applications, building upon our preliminary work with a
novel nanocrystal technology (PDZ1i-Nano), and to characterize non-cell-autonomous mechanisms by which
PDZ1i suppresses tumor growth. Focus will be on the immune system, particularly the infiltration of effector
immune cells in response to PDZ1i-Nano treated tumor cells. Experiments will employ TNBC metastatic mouse
models, and human patient-derived (PDX) tumors and humanized mice. The precise impact of this recruitment
on tumor growth control will be evaluated in this aim. In Specific Aim 2, genome wide datasets will be used to
define the signaling pathways, regulatory transcription factors and down-stream gene targets regulated by MDA-
9 to promote cell motility in vitro and metastasis in vivo. In Specific Aim 3, PDZ1i-Nano will be combined with a
standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy, paclitaxel (Taxol), to improve the therapy of mouse models of TNBC.
These studies will include using PDZ1i-Nano in both an adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting as a means of
preventing the appearance of metastases. Experiments will study how PDZ1i-Nano sensitizes TNBC cells or the
host cells to the effects of chemotherapies to improve tumor growth control, which are required for PDZ1i to
progress into clinical trials. Because the PDZ1i small molecule inhibitor has initial favorable drug characteristics
(ADME, pharmacokinetics and toxicity testing), performs well in mouse tumor models, can be combined with
FDA approved SOC chemotherapies, the results of this research program could lead to entry into phase I clinical
trials, reducing the lag time until benefits could be realized by breast cancer patients."

This proposed project aims to develop a wearable ultrasonic patch for automatic, continuous, and noninvasive
central blood pressure monitoring. Hypertension is a “silent killer” since it gradually induces a series of
cardiovascular diseases, usually without any obvious symptoms. Compared with brachial blood pressure
acquired by the cuff, blood pressure at central locations has been proven to be more valuable for predicting
future cardiovascular events and disease risks. Thus, it is essential to measure central blood pressure regularly
to maximize the blood pressure management outcome. This research is distinct from all other existing methods
for central blood pressure measurements that have a series of different technical challenges, such as the use of
invasive procedures, insufficient accuracy, and significant dependence on the operator’s skills. In 2018, the PI’s
group invented the first wearable ultrasonic device for central blood pressure recording, supported by an R21
grant from NIH. However, this device still needs cables for power and data transfer, manual processing of the
data, and a low signal-to-noise ratio. In this proposed project, we will demonstrate a wearable ultrasonic
transducer array integrated with miniaturized wireless control electronics and automatic data processing
algorithms. The integrated control electronics will eliminate the bulky setup and connecting wires. The
phased-array beamforming will focus and steer the ultrasound beam to search the blood vessels and improve
the signal-to-noise ratio and the spatial resolution. All data acquired by the wearable ultrasonic device will be
wirelessly transmitted to a terminal receiver (e.g., a smartphone), where a deep learning based algorithm is
running for further data processing. The customized algorithm will automatically localize the targeted artery and
track both the anterior and posterior walls of the vessel without the supervision of human operators. Thereby,
the operator dependence in conventional ultrasound systems will be eliminated, and device usability can be
much improved. Finally, the proposed entire system will be validated on patients against arterial catheterization,
the current gold standard for central blood pressure monitoring in clinical settings. If successful, this proposed
study will provide patients with a device that can access their central blood pressure automatically, continuously,
and noninvasively. Using a stretchable platform that matches the softness of the human skin will make a key
difference in patient acceptance and monitoring outcomes. The ease of measurements enabled by the
automatic algorithm can significantly help high-throughput screening of central blood pressure in the general
population and guide the development of antihypertensive drugs, which can eventually translate to a significant
reduction in blood pressure associated mortality and healthcare costs."
10806162,"Understanding the function of the nervous system requires a sophisticated understanding of its main
output, behavior. Although our ability to record from and to manipulate neurons and neural circuits has
accelerated at a spectacular pace over the last decade, progress has lagged in coupling the interrogation of
the nervous system to similarly high-resolution measures of behavior. As a consequence, we lack a
sophisticated understanding of how the brain composes, modifies and controls action.
 We have recently developed a transformative behavioral characterization technology called Motion
Sequencing (MoSeq), which circumvents many of the limitations imposed by typical approaches to behavioral
measurement (e.g., overtraining, head-fixation, limited behavioral flexibility). This analytical system works by
capturing comprehensive and continuous morphometric data about the three-dimensional (3D) posture of a
mouse as it freely behaves. The 3D data are then analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm
to identify patterns of motion that correspond to stereotyped and reused modules of sub-second behavior
(which by analogy to natural language we refer to as behavioral “syllables”). The output of this fitting procedure
is a parts list for behavior: a limited set of syllables out of which the rodent creates all of its observable action.
In addition, within any given experiment MoSeq identifies the specific transition structure (or “grammar”) that
places individual syllables into sequences; these sequences encode all patterns of spontaneous behavior
expressed by an animal in a given experimental context. We have recently combined this behavioral
assessment technology with techniques for neural recording, allowing us to assess the relationship between
neural activity in behaviorally-relevant circuits and patterns of action. This combined approach allowed us, for
example, to identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics in striatum; importantly, these observed
correlations validate MoSeq as a technology that enables accurate inference of internal states from external
states. However, the code that underlies MoSeq is essentially bespoke, inappropriate for distribution, and
difficult for all but expert users to navigate. In addition, implementing MoSeq in its current form requires
extensive prior mathematical and computational experience, limiting its use to a small set of users with
specialized skills. Here we propose Aims to democratize MoSeq by (1) transforming it into an end-to-end
pipeline that can be easily used by graduate-student level neuroscientists with minimal expertise, and which
can be modified on an ongoing basis to accommodate improvements to MoSeq and (2) to offer hands-on
training in the set-up and appropriate use of MoSeq for characterizing behavior and neural-behavioral
relationships. Together these aims will create a vibrant community of MoSeq users; the creation of such a
group has the potential to transform the way behavior is analyzed across neuroscience, and promises to lead
to broad insights into the many and varied relationships between neural circuits and behavior."
10932322,"Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is the third leading cause of preventable deaths in U.S. and accounts for over 10%
of U.S. hospital admissions. Treatment for this population often fails to address the underlying cause of the
hospitalization: the AUD. Patients hospitalized with alcohol-related medical complications tend to have high-risk
for recurrence of alcohol-related medical problems, high rates of hospital readmissions, and poor recovery
outcomes. Methods that promote long-term recovery care are needed. Inpatient linkage to peer recovery
coaching may bridge this gap in care by providing a method of continued care for AUD recovery that offers
flexibility in recovery pathways, peer modeling opportunities, and strong social support. Pilot study results
demonstrated the feasibility of inpatient linkage to peer recovery coaching and showed evidence of decreased
alcohol consumption, increased engagement in treatment and recovery support programs, and decreased
emergency department visits. However, pilot study sample size, outcomes, and methods were limited. This
proposal seeks to overcome these limitations and build on these preliminary results by: using ecological
momentary assessments, measuring recovery using the new NIAAA definition, examining cost-effectiveness,
assessing alcohol consumption using an additional objective measure (breath alcohol content levels), and
examining social support and self-efficacy as potential mechanisms of effectiveness. This proposal will rigorously
test the effectiveness of an inpatient peer recovery coaching service called the RC-Link program on recovery
outcomes in patients hospitalized with medical complications from AUD. The program involves a bedside
introduction to a peer recovery coach during the patient’s hospitalization plus continued, recovery support for
six-months. The RC-Link program provides standardized peer recovery service that is both personalized to the
patients’ needs and generalized to provide socioemotional, instrumental, and informational social support during
every patient encounter. Aim 1 will determine the effect of the RC-Link program on frequency of heavy drinking,
biopsychosocial functioning, and remission from AUD compared to controls. Aim 2 will examine how daily
changes in perceived social support and self-efficacy influence alcohol consumption and determine whether
such associations differ between the RC-Link and control groups. Aim 3 will examine the cost-effectiveness of
the RC-Link program; hospital utilization rates will be examined as secondary outcomes. These aims will be
evaluated using a two-arm randomized controlled trial that compares the RC-Link program intervention to a
control group that receives a brief intervention and connection to a peer recovery coach after the study period.
Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, monthly during the 6-month study period, and 6-months post-
intervention. This study has potential to advance recovery care for AUD by providing a better understanding of
how long-term, inpatient-initiated peer recovery coaching influences recovery outcomes over time in this
population."
10935990,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Itaconate is a major regulator of macrophage inflammatory activity through its ability to directly alkylate
cysteines on critical target proteins. Using our newly developed mass spectrometric (MS) method (CPT-MS),
we identified a newfound regulated cysteine on the SH2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1
(SHP-1) as a target of itaconate in both mouse and human macrophages. We developed a library of highly
potent itaconate-mimetics and found that the anti-inflammatory activity of these molecules was dependent on
this critical SHP-1 cysteine modification. Together, this led us to hypothesize that the newfound SHP-1
regulatory cysteine (Cys102) is a critical proximal inhibitor of macrophage cytokine production, and that
chemical modification of this site presents an unprecedented opportunity to modulate the production of
inflammatory cytokines. We will test our hypothesis through three aims: Aim 1) To determine the structural
basis of SHP-1 cysteine regulation and its role in macrophage activation, we will combine our CPT-MS
platform, protein crystallography and biochemistry, loss-of-function models, and cytokine production assays to
define the role of SHP-1 and its Cys102 residue in macrophage activation. Aim 2) To identify potent itaconate-
mimetic chemotypes that can selectively target the SHP-1 activation cysteine in macrophages, we will use
structure guided medicinal chemistry to improve potency and specificity of our lead itaconate-mimetics. The
newly synthesized compounds will be tested using phenotypic and MS assays in both mouse and human
macrophages. Aim 3) To define the interactome and downstream effectors of SHP-1 upon cysteine activation,
we will use MS to identify the SHP-1 binding partners, and genetic modification via CRISPR/Cas9 to validate
the role of these interactions in macrophage activity and cytokine production. We will also examine the role of
known SHP-1 binding partners, IRAK and STAT3, in macrophage deactivation. If successful, our project will for
the first time 1) define the role of SHP-1 cysteine activation in itaconate-mediated inhibition of macrophage
activity and 2) identify new compounds with potential to inhibit macrophage cytotoxic activity with high
specificity and efficacy. This will represent an important step forward in both our understanding of the
fundamental mechanisms of macrophage biology and development of compounds that can serve as both
highly specific biological tools and have translational potential for pathologies characterized by chronic
inflammation."

 Dopaminergic signaling is proposed to be critical for gating items into working memory and for
maintaining representational content over delays in the presence of distracting information. Working memory
deficits due to dysregulated dopaminergic signaling are associated with a broad range of psychiatric illnesses.
However, the precise role of dopamine in working memory has yet to be fully understood due to limits on our
ability to measure it in humans.
 Recent advances by PI Montague’s research group allow for tracking neuromodulator release in
epilepsy patients using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry augmented with machine learning (elastic net regression).
Our team can now measure dopamine responses in awake humans with sub-second temporal resolution,
allowing for precise characterization of phasic and tonic dopamine release in cortical areas that have been
associated with cognitive processes that constitute working memory. This application merges this technique
with measurement of working memory processes to test fundamental predictions about dopamine’s function in
cognitive control.
 We will record dopamine release in the lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and
hippocampus during performance of a set of working memory tasks. Medication-resistant epilepsy patients will
participate in the study during phase-II monitoring for seizure activity with surgically implanted electrodes.
These electrodes will be implanted at Banner Hospital in the Phoenix metropolitan area (Co-I Bina). During
recording, patients will complete Delay Match-to-Sample and Delayed Estimation Visual Working Memory
tasks. Our research group (Co-I Brewer, Co-I Bae, and Co-I McClure) has used these tasks to characterize
individual differences in working memory and to explore the neural basis of working memory for the past 15
years. The overall goal of this project is to collect and model direct dopamine recordings during stimulus
presentation, distractor presentation, and delay periods of canonical working memory tasks to better
characterize the role of phasic and tonic dopamine release in working memory."
10934495,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Multicomponent interventions delivered in school-based health centers (SBHCs) have the potential to
decrease asthma morbidity in children from communities that experience health inequities. Asthma is the most
common chronic disease in children. Black and Hispanic children from low-socioeconomic communities
account for a disproportionate percentage of asthma exacerbations, emergency department (ED) visits, and
hospitalizations. These children often do not receive guideline-based asthma care, and adherence to daily
preventive asthma medication is poor. Traditional health service delivery models where care is received in
physicians’ offices have limited success in improving asthma outcomes in vulnerable populations. This is
attributable to multiple social determinants of health that interrupt consistent comprehensive care, including
limited availability of health services, lack of transportation, and caregiver employment demands. As a result,
these children often receive crisis-driven care rather than prevention-driven care. SBHCs can serve as a safety
net for children living in poor communities and improve health outcomes. SBHCs are staffed by advanced
practice providers (APPs) who can assess and manage diseases. There are therefore minimal costs to
integrating an asthma management program within this existing health care delivery model.
Project ASTHMA (Aligning with Schools To Help Manage Asthma) is a prospective, stepped wedge cluster
randomized trial based on a successful pilot study, that aims to assess the effectiveness of SBHCs as a cost
effective health care delivery model to reduce asthma symptoms, exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations
in children with uncontrolled asthma who live in communities with health inequities. The intervention will take
place in SBHCs located in 10 Buffalo Public Schools. The APPs at the SBHCs randomized to Project ASTHMA
that year will be trained and supported to deliver guideline-based chronic asthma care. Students enrolled in
Project ASTHMA will receive asthma assessments and preventive medication management from the APPs,
directly observed therapy of their preventive asthma medication from school nurses to support adherence, and
self-management support to improve adherence to home doses of asthma medication. Students enrolled at the
SBHCs randomized to the control that year will be in an enhanced usual care group who will receive an
asthma assessment by the research team and then be referred to their primary care provider for assessment
and medication management. SBHCs are a financially and clinically sustainable health care delivery model,
and have the potential to substantially decrease inequities in asthma morbidity. If disseminated, Project
ASTHMA has the potential to improve the health of children in high-poverty schools throughout the country.
These improvements are likely to be cost-effective for state and county health departments because over
2,500 SBHCs already exist in hundreds of communities in the United States. Evidence generated through our
findings can assist public health policymakers in determining priorities and allocating resources to SBHCs."

The discovery of new disease-modifying treatments for low back pain and spine degeneration requires a more
complete understanding of the mechanisms controlling intervertebral disc (IVDs) formation and maintenance.
Our objective in this proposal is to use knowledge from a series of conditional mouse models, where TonEBP is
ablated in specific compartments of the IVD, (i) to characterize a newly identified function of TonEBP as a
component of the machinery required for vesicular protein transport and secretion and ii)
to improve our
understanding of the nature of the interactions between IVD compartments during formation and maintenance
of the spine.
Our central hypothesis is that TonEBP is required, via its role in vesicular protein transport, for the
secretion of extracellular and signaling molecules important for the maintenance of, and communication
between, IVD compartments. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of TonEBP in vesicular protein trafficking. We
will use TonEBP cKO sclerotome-derived (chondrocytes) and notochord-derived (NP) cells to determine the
subcellular localization of TonEBP within the vesicular secretory pathway, in which subcellular compartment
defects occur in this pathway, and whether TonEBP deficiency alters the UPR or autophagy pathways. We will
characterize the TonEBP interactome with a focus on vesicular assembly and organization proteins identified by
pull-down and LC-MS/MS assay. By comparing the behavior of cells grown in isotonic and hypertonic conditions,
we will determine if a rise in extracellular osmolarity and its promotion of TonEBP nuclear translocation alters
the cytosolic level and function of TonEBP. In Aim 2, we reason that the protein trafficking and secretory defects
associated with TonEBP deficiency is a feature of all IVD cells that alters the ECM and thus the structure of the
IVD, as well as the autocrine and paracrine signaling of cells forming and maintaining each IVD compartment.
We will use conditional TonEBP postnatal ablation in NP cells only (TonEBP-iK19cKO), or in annulus fibrosus,
cartilage end plate (CEP) and growth plate cells only (TonEBP-iCol2cKO) in a longitudinal comparative analysis
to determine if TonEBP-dependent secreted factors influence, in a cell-intrinsic or paracrine manner, each IVD
compartment and adjacent ones. We will also determine if an increase in CEP extracellular matrix permeability
or the release of secreted proteins from mutant CEPs contribute to NP cell enlargement in iCol2 cKO mice, and
how NP cells keep a brake on the proliferation of cells in CEP and vertebral growth plates."

 Attention is the gateway to all we perceive, learn, and remember, and disorders of attention are a national
public health concern. Although we live in a world of overlapping, dynamic, multimodal events, little is known
about the development of attention amidst this complexity. Infants must learn to selectively attend to unitary
multimodal events (intersensory processing, IP) by detecting synchronous sights and sounds (e.g., face and
voice of a speaker), and to flexibly shift and maintain attention in the context of competing stimulation. These
basic “multisensory attention skills” (MASks) provide a cornerstone for language, socio-emotional (SE), and
cognitive development. However, there is no systematic database depicting the typical development of these
foundational MASks or the developmental pathways leading to optimal outcomes. A key obstacle to progress
has been the lack of individual difference measures appropriate for infants and children. To address this gap,
we created the first such protocols. Our measures index IP, attention maintenance, and shifting in the context
of overlapping audiovisual social and nonsocial events at a grain of analysis needed for characterizing skills of
individual children, developmental change, and risk for atypical development. In our current RO1, we assessed
longitudinal growth in MASks (across 3-72 mos; N=133). Our findings have modeled developmental pathways
demonstrating that infant MASks cascade to an impressive range of critical child outcomes including language,
school readiness, SE, and executive functioning. In the current proposal, we build on these novel findings: a)
We extend our longitudinal testing through preadolescence (PreAd; 9, 10, 11 yrs; N=178), a particularly
vulnerable period for SE development. b) We assess a new outcome domain, academic achievement, and
broaden assessment of the SE domain given their importance for successful functioning in PreAd. c) We add a
new predictor domain, family context (SES, maternal SE functioning, maternal sensitivity) known to predict
child outcomes but never before linked to MASks. Using cutting-edge SEM-based growth curve and panel
modeling, we will model how infant MASks develop and cascade to these important domains in childhood and
PreAd. The specific aims are to characterize the typical longitudinal growth of MASks and define values
signifying risk for delays (Aim 1), characterize pathways from infant MASks to all outcome domains (Aim 2),
and assess the role of family context in shaping MASks and pathways to outcomes (Aim 3). With the larger
sample at 9-11 yrs, we can test hypothesized and alternative models of developmental pathways in greater
detail. Findings will be shared via Databrary and promise to advance theory, methodology, and knowledge by
providing the first tools, data, and knowledgebase of developmental processes through which basic MASks
influence a host of later outcomes. This has potential to catalyze a shift in the study of multisensory attention in
line with the current shift in developmental science, focusing on individual differences and developmental
change—a level of analysis necessary for identifying atypical development and guiding interventions."
10803394,"Inter-individual variability is a common observation in studying neural systems but is often ignored in favor of
developing a general understanding of properties and responses that are the mean across individuals. This is
because we accept that neural circuits should produce stable, robust, and consistent activity, characteristic for
each behavioral context. All neural activity results from ionic currents that shape the outputs of individual
neurons or produce synaptic interactions. However, within the same neuron type, these currents and the
channels that underlie their expression show considerable variability across individuals. It remains unclear
how neurons with variable levels of ionic currents and synaptic interactions could produce consistent circuit
output activity with low inter-individual variability of output attributes. The inter-individual variability of ionic
currents is not a static problem, as neuromodulators tune those currents, thereby providing flexibility to neural
circuit activity and behavior. While neuromodulation itself can be a source of inter-individual variability,
functional circuit output should not only be similar across individuals at some basic level but should also
respond similarly to neuromodulators that shape it into different modes of operation, adaptive to different
behavioral contexts. While the role neuromodulators play in providing flexibility of circuits in individuals is well
studied, the role of neuromodulation in producing consistent functional circuit output across individuals is not.
Multiple neuromodulators act on a neural circuit at the same time. Such comodulation is understood to
enhance flexibility by increasing the number of possible circuit states. We propose that comodulation with
excitatory modulators that have convergent cellular effects promotes consistency and robustness of circuit
output. An increase in the number of circuit elements that are targeted results in more consistent overall circuit
activation, and an overall increase in excitability pushes individuals closer to shared upper boundaries of
neuron and synapse activation. We will test this hypothesis in the stomatogastric nervous system, which has
been instrumental in establishing the general organizing principles of convergent and divergent comodulation
and is an ideal testbed for understanding neural circuit dynamics. We will use electrophysiological methods to
determine the effects of single and multiple neuromodulators on individual circuit components, circuit
operation, and output activity. We will apply different sequences of increasing numbers of modulators, either
with converging or diverging cellular and synaptic actions, and determine the effects on inter-individual
variability and mean similarity of circuit output attributes. In parallel, we will use biophysical approaches,
computational modeling and mathematical analysis to understand the underlying cellular and ionic
mechanisms in circuit components that account for consistent circuit output. This work will produce a general
framework to understand the role of comodulation in the production of robust and consistent circuit output."

While it has long been established that exercise training can have profound effects on systemic glucose
homeostasis and skeletal muscle metabolism, more recent research has demonstrated that adipose tissues
also play an important role in mediating the benefits of exercise on metabolic health. Studies supported by this
award have shown that subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT), the adipose tissue located beneath the
skin, undergoes profound changes in gene and protein expression, structural architecture, and adipokine
profile in response to exercise training, adaptations that play a strategic role in regulating systemic exercise-
facilitated metabolic benefits. The signaling and intracellular mechanisms that control these important changes
in scWAT phenotype and function are not known, but our preliminary data demonstrate that lactate and
glycogen, two factors typically associated with skeletal muscle metabolism in response to exercise, also play
fundamental roles in regulating exercise training effects on scWAT. In Specific Aim 1 lactate signaling through
the G-protein receptor 81 (GPR81) and glycogen metabolism will be investigated as essential mediators of
exercise training-induced adaptations to scWAT phenotype, and in turn, whole body systemic metabolism.
Numerous approaches including genetically modified mouse models, physiological assessments, proteomics,
RNAseq, and lipidomics will be used for this Aim. Specific Aims 2 and 3 will focus on visceral white adipose
tissue (vWAT), the adipose depot that surrounds the internal organs under conditions of fuel over-abundance.
While vWAT has been less studied in the context of molecular adaptations to training, our recently published
multi-omics project investigating key metabolic tissues led to the discovery that under obese conditions,
exercise training induces more profound cellular composition and transcriptomic changes in vWAT compared
to scWAT. We also found that obesity and training significantly impact crosstalk between immune cells and
adipose stem cells (ASCs) in vWAT. Given that exercise is a potent epigenetic modulator, we hypothesize
that exercise training reverses the unfavorable responses to obesity by rewiring of the underlying epigenome
of vWAT. In Specific Aim 2, single cell level open chromatin accessibility and lncRNA expression profiling in vWAT
will be done to determine the epigenetic mechanisms mediating the effects of exercise training and obesity. In Aim
3, exercise training- and obesity-induced immune cell-ASC crosstalk using in vitro and in vivo models will be studied.
This will include a focus on the putative interaction between amphiregulin, produced by type 2 innate lymphoid
cells (ILC2s) with epidermal growth factor receptor of the ASCs, as this was the most striking interaction
predicted by our in-silico single cell analysis. To complement our expertise in exercise science, adipose tissue
biology, cell signaling, metabolism, and in vivo models, studies will be performed in collaboration with world
renown experts in computational biology and immunology. Thus, these studies will generate high quality
scientific discoveries with high potential for clinical impact for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes."

Glaucoma is a major cause of blindness, affecting over 80 million people worldwide. Glaucoma is a
neurodegenerative optic neuropathy caused by the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), leading to loss of
vision. Current therapies are all directed at lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), and yet RGC loss still
continues in many patients despite IOP lowering. The identification of an agent that complements IOP lowering
by promoting RGC survival would be a significant advance toward improving the visual outcomes of patients
with glaucoma. Using cultures of primary RGC, we screened more than 10,000 compounds and identified
candidates with potent neuroprotective properties, including a drug that is FDA-approved for an unrelated
indication. We further characterized the novel pathway through which these compounds act to protect RGC,
thus identifying a novel drug/drug target combination for neuroprotection. We have also developed a novel
thermosensitive gel-forming eye drop drug delivery system that provides efficacious drug delivery to the
posterior segment, even in large animals (rabbits, pigs). Importantly, we observed that the combination of more
effective intraocular drug penetration provided by the gel-forming eye drop with a drug that binds to melanin in
the eye, led to RGC protection in vivo with once weekly topical dosing. In this application, we are screening
additional neuroprotective drugs for melanin binding, cell uptake, and intraocular penetration to compare head-
to-head for pharmacokinetics and efficacy in an optic nerve crush rat model and a bead injection mouse model
of IOP elevation. The goal is to develop an efficacious eye drop for neuroprotection that requires once weekly,
or ideally once monthly maintenance dosing. In Aim 1, we will make further formulation changes in the eye
drop to increase intraocular drug absorption, and formulate additional melanin-binding neuroprotective drugs.
In Aim 2, we will characterize the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of a variety of dosing regimens and
formulations to identify the most effective dosing approach with the lowest dosing frequency. In Aim 3, we will
perform dose-ranging studies in rabbits to achieve similar drug concentrations in target tissues that were
shown to be effective in Aim 2. We will also perform safety evaluations with longitudinal dosing, including
fundus exams, IOP, and retinal morphology analyses. The demonstration of efficacy in rodent models of
neurodegeneration along with similar pharmacokinetics and no overt toxicity in the rabbit eye, would provide
evidence of the therapeutic potential of our neuroprotective drug delivery strategy for the treatment of
glaucoma."

By age 75, individuals sleep about 1.5 hr. less per night, take longer to fall asleep, wake up more frequently at
night and are more likely to nap during the day than at age 25. Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease/Lewy
body dementia, and fronto-temporal lobe dementia exacerbate these problems. We hypothesize that the
changes in wake-sleep and circadian behavior during aging are due to subclinical neurodegeneration
of wake-sleep and circadian circuitry as a continuous process during aging. This would be similar to
REM sleep behavior disorder, which often occurs 10-15 years before a diagnosable synucleinopathy. We
further hypothesize that different neurodegenerative disorders may affect different patterns of wake-
sleep and circadian cell groups and cause different behavioral changes. If this hypothesis is correct, it
may be possible to use specific sleep and circadian disturbances as biomarkers to identify early, preclinical
stages of these disorders. We propose here to test these hypotheses using two unique sets of subjects from
the Rush Memory and Aging cohorts, who have actigraphic recording of rest-activity behaviors. In the first set
of subjects, who have had actigraphy within one year of death and a brain autopsy, we will analyze the
actigraphy for sleep time, sleep fragmentation, and sleep efficiency during the night, nap time during the day,
and circadian activity phase and amplitude. We expect to find that cell loss will be associated with
deposition of pathological proteins in wake-sleep and circadian cell groups, and specific patterns of
wake-sleep and circadian behavioral deficits, even if there was no diagnosable neurodegenerative
disorder during life. In Aim 1, we will look at wake-promoting (orexin, tuberomammillary, A10, raphe,
pedunculopontine, parabrachial, and locus coeruleus), sleep promoting (ventrolateral preoptic, MCH), and
circadian (suprachiasmatic vasopressin and VIP neurons) cell groups for association between deposition of
neurodegenerative pathological protein deposits (beta-amyloid, phospho-tau, phospho-α-synuclein, phospho-
TDP-43) and reduced numbers of surviving neurons. In Aim 2, we will look for association of changes in sleep
time, efficiency, fragmentation, and napping, as well as changes in circadian amplitude or phase with numbers
of remaining neurons and deposition of neurodegenerative proteins in the same cell groups as Aim 1. In Aim
3, we will test a separate validation cohort of patients who had actigraphy 2 or more years prior to death and
clinical and pathological diagnosis at the time of death, to determine whether specific wake-sleep or circadian
deficits predict later neurodegenerative diagnoses. We hope to be able to identify patterns of wake-sleep
and circadian deficits during life using actigraphy, an inexpensive, non-invasive, and widely available
tool, that predict and act as biomarkers for subclinical presence of Alzheimer’s disease and other
neurodegenerative disorders, similar to the relationship of REM sleep behavior disorder and
synucleinopathies."

 The short-term training goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate with mentoring and training in
computational biology and data science. The long-term objectives are to establish robust computational and

OG1RF and the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans, as the candidate determined that S. mutans kills
OG1RF and a vancomycin-resistant isolate of E. faecalis through an unknown mechanism. Together, this
research will generate genome-scale descriptions of gene function in medically relevant bacteria and define
mechanisms by which novel factors contribute to biofilm formation and interactions between microbes.
 The University of Minnesota provides an ideal institutional environment for this work. This highly
collaborative environment has diverse microbiology and computational biology research groups from
biomedical, dental, veterinary, and basic science backgrounds. U Minnesota also offers exceptional career
development opportunities, and the U Minnesota Genomics Center is a state-of-the-art facility with which the

 Together, the proposed training and research will be a platform from which the candidate will launch an
independent research career combining functional genomics with in vitro model systems to study hypothetical

Preterm infants experience high rates of severe morbidity and mortality prior to discharge home. One of the
leading factors associated with morbidity and mortality is being born small for gestational age (SGA; less than
10th percentile for gestational age and sex). While many etiologic factors have been identified, including
maternal illnesses, infections, and prenatal exposures, these factors explain only a fraction preterm SGA birth.
Some genetic disorders have been shown to cause preterm SGA birth. Genetic disorders have also been
linked to morbidity and mortality in related populations. My prior research and that of others indicates that
genetic disorders likely contribute, but the overall genetic contribution is unknown. In this project, my team and
I will define the prevalence of genetic disorders in this population, the contribution of genetic disorders to
morbidity and mortality, and identify disorders in novel genes associated with preterm SGA birth. Using similar
strategies, I recently determined that congenital renal anomalies are prevalent in preterm infants, and strongly
associated with genetic disorders. Work by my mentors showed that a specific class of genetic variants—loss-
of-function (LoF) variants in novel genes—contribute to related diseases. I hypothesize that common, rare, and
novel genetic disorders contribute to preterm SGA birth, morbidity, and mortality. I will investigate this through
three complementary aims: 1) define epidemiologic factors associated with preterm SGA birth, including
common genetic disorders, 2) determine the prevalence of rare genetic disorders in preterm SGA infants, and
3) identify novel genes associated with preterm SGA birth. Positive results would inform improved diagnosis
and management of this high-risk population and inform new research into molecular pathogenesis. Negative
results would inform research into environmental factors, as well as other genetic diagnostic strategies.
This project is central to my Career Development Plan, which consists of three Training Goals: 1)
epidemiologic research, 2) human genetics research, and 3) academic development. This project will be
mentored by world-class experts in human genetics and perinatal medicine: Drs. Ali Gharavi, Anna Penn, and
Ronald Wapner. And this project will be conducted at one of the premier research institutions, Columbia
University, which supports a regional referral neonatal ICU and the Institute for Genomic Medicine. Aim 1 of
this project will be conducted using a robust database containing records from 409,704 preterm infants. And I
will be supported by expert advisors in epidemiology, statistics, and genomics. Through the completion of this
research and training, I will gain an ideal skillset to become an R01-funded investigator advancing the field of
genomic neonatology."

Colonization factors that facilitate establishment in the complex and competitive environment of the
gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome are still relatively unknown, but knowledge of these factors will be crucial for
understanding the formation of this ecosystem and reveal novel therapeutic avenues to manipulate this
community. Serving as potential colonization factors, Diversity Generating Retroelements (DGRs) are genetic
elements found in bacteria, archaea, and their viruses that are capable of accelerating evolution by rapidly
diversifying ligand binding proteins to alter their ligand recognition. The GI microbiome is the most enriched
ecosystem for DGRs known to date, but the role of DGRs within the microbiome remains completely unexplored.
Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how DGR-driven genotypic variation contributes
to adaptive bacterial phenotypes in the GI microbiome, especially in response to dynamic shifts in the
environment, such as during colonization or from perturbations to the community. The candidate will use five
carefully selected strains of Bacteroides, each of which contains a similar but non-identical DGR that diversifies
either a pilus tip adhesin or a periplasmic protein. In Aim 1, he will uncover factors that control DGR activity in
Bacteroides spp. In Aim 2, he will characterize the in vivo roles of the diversified proteins and identify other
proteins that functionally interact with these diversified proteins. Lastly, in Aim 3, the candidate will determine
the selective fitness advantages conferred by DGR-directed accelerated protein evolution. These aims require
the application of genetic systems to manipulate Bacteroides genomes, RT-qPCR, genome-wide Tn-insertion
sequencing, tandem mass spectroscopy, deep sequencing, computational methods to measure single
nucleotide variation, and gnotobiotic mouse models. Practical implications of this work include the identification
of DGR-encoded and host-encoded factors that control DGR activity in Bacteroides, characterization of the
functions of Bacteroides diversified proteins, and an understanding of how diversification can be utilized to create
selective fitness advantages in complex microbial communities. Insights derived from this proposal will ultimately
be developed into a toolkit for engineering adaptative colonization systems in beneficial microbes that will
facilitate their efficient engraftment into disrupted microbiomes to reverse the dysbiotic states that are often
associated with diseases such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and cardiovascular disease. Included in
this proposal is a detailed career development plan that outlines a five-year timeline for the candidate that
includes hands-on and didactic training in structural biology, bioinformatics, and ecology and evolution. It also
details a diverse, multidisciplinary, and complementary advisory team, including an experienced primary mentor,
who will guide the candidate in both scientific inquiry and career development. By the conclusion of this award,
a successful transition to independence is anticipated to establish an R01-funded research program using DGR-
driven technologies to engineer microbiomes."
10785474,"Project Summary/Abstract
Altered neural-immune (NI) gene expression has been observed in postmortem brain tissue from individuals with
schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders. One mechanism by which NI function may affect the
brain is through effects on neurite outgrowth and synaptic pruning during development; however, the effects of
NI gene expression on in vivo brain development and behavior are not known. A major barrier to understanding
how interindividual differences in NI expression relate to heterogeneous developmental trajectories is the inability
to measure gene expression in the living human brain. Through a coordinated set of multimodal analyses, the
current proposal aims to define the polygenic architecture of NI gene expression to generate a genome-wide
resource for individual-level prediction and characterization of its impact on brain and behavioral trajectories in
the pediatric population. Integrating functional genomic data from the PsychENCODE Consortium with several
other large-scale resources, we will perform a multi-ancestry genome wide association study (GWAS) to identify
the genetically regulated component of NI expression (GREx) in >4,000 human brain samples (Aim 1). Next,
using genetics data in >11,000 multiethnic youth from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)
Study, we will compute individual-level predictions of NI GREx and test the relationship with longitudinal
trajectories of structural brain development (Aim 2). Finally, to examine how interindividual variability in NI GREx
may relate to clinically-relevant symptomatology, we will test the relationship between NI GREx and age-related
change in dimensional measures of mental health relevant to psychosis and other related neurodevelopmental
disorders (Aim 3). By examining links between NI GREx and brain development in a large population-
representative cohort of children, this project has the potential to inform our understanding of mental health as a
continuous construct, and to aid in the prospective identification of individuals at heightened risk for psychosis
and other psychiatric disorders. These aims are in-line with the NIMH strategic plan to define the brain
mechanisms underlying complex behaviors, and to examine mental illness trajectories across the lifespan. The
proposed research will take place at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) under the mentorship of
Drs. Daniel Geschwind, Carrie Bearden, Bodgan Pasaniuc, and Wesley Thompson, experts in functional
genomics, psychosis spectrum disorders, computational genetics, and longitudinal statistical analyses,
respectively. The proposed K01 will provide the PI with mentored research training in transcriptomics, including
the analysis and interpretation of post-mortem human brain RNA-sequencing data, multi-ancestry GWAS, the
neurobiology of psychosis, and statistical methods to model longitudinal data. This research and training will lay
the foundation for the PI’s career development as a leading expert in the neurogenetic etiology of psychosis and
pleiotropic psychiatric disorders. Results will support a future R01 extending this work into clinically ascertained
populations and will elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental heterogeneity in youth."
10909314,"Project Summary
Oxidative stress is a byproduct of energy production necessary for all living organisms and caused by
unregulated reactive oxygen/nitrogen/carbonyl species (ROS/RNS/RCS) among others. Nature has evolved the
oxidative stress response (OSR) as a key component of metabolism that maintains cellular homeostasis by
detoxifying and neutralizing aberrant reactive molecules. Spatiotemporally control of OSR is achieved through
compartmentalization and redundancies that are coupled to create a redox balance to promote survival.
Unbalanced OSR due to a defective or overactive capacity to resolve oxidative damage is associated with
various human diseases. For example, chronic OSR is a hallmark of obesity, a global epidemic as well as a
major risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. To better understand
obesity, it is paramount that we elucidate the coordination of the OSR metabolon, defined here as the sequential
antioxidant enzymes, biochemical reactions, and cellular compartments that maintain redox homeostasis.
The proper regulation of and adaptive changes by OSR require rapid signaling taking place in the seconds-to-
minute timeframe. Such dynamics must therefore require fast regulatory networks such as protein post-
translational modifications (PTMs). Phosphorylation of serine (S) (~90%), threonine (T) (~9%), and tyrosine (Y)
(~0.1-1%) residues are one of the many ways cells regulate pathways that maximize survival. Initial evaluation
of the published phosphoproteome stratified by enzyme classification and pathway enrichment analysis indicates
that, despite low intracellular stoichiometry, pY are enriched on antioxidant enzymes. However, the majority of
pY sites on antioxidant enzymes are not functionally characterized. My overarching goal in this proposal is to
gain network level insight into the pY directed regulation of antioxidant enzymes and the resulting dynamics of
dysregulated OSR. I hypothesize that obesity-driven pY on multiple antioxidant enzymes modulates their
catalytic activity to produce systemic changes in OSR. I will test this hypothesis by employing proteomics,
metabolomics, structural analysis, and computational modeling. During the mentored phase of this application,
I will predict the functional role of previously uncharacterized pY, validate predictions using in vivo as well as in
vitro enzyme kinetic assays, and demonstrate pY-driven OSR dysregulation in an in vivo high-fat diet (HFD)-
induced obesity mouse model. Through these interdisciplinary approaches, I aim to define systems of pY-
modified enzymes that “tune” metabolic response to HFD, and evaluate differential regulation of OSR in a sex
specific manner. Additionally, I will determine how altered dietary serine, glycine, or addition of small molecule
antioxidants ameliorate HFD phenotypes, and the sex specific responses in the OSR metabolon that may be
therapeutically relevant. This proposal and the outlined training plan will equip me with the technical skills,
scientific knowledge, and professional training that will serve as the foundation to launch my research focused
on OSR regulation as an independent investigator."
10785846,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) activity is critically important for response to motivated stimuli, including
aversive stimuli. However, it is not known how the NAc processes and responds to these stimuli across the 24hrs
cycle. We and others have found NAc shows daily changes in neuronal activity which appears to be in phase
with circadian-dependent dopamine release from the primary dopamine input to the NAc, the ventral tegmental
area (VTA). Therefore, response to motivated stimuli may vary depending on time-of-day. We recently
discovered the circadian gene CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) modulates Gs-protein coupled with dopamine 1 (D1)
receptor which may alter neuronal activity and excitability of NAc projection neurons. These data suggest
circadian regulation of dopamine receptor activity in the NAc has the ability to strongly alter response to
dopamine driven by aversive stimuli via the dopamine 1 receptor. We hypothesize that CRY controls circadian
NAc activity through modulation of dopamine 1 receptor function.
 In year 1 of this proposal, we will assess the role of CRY in regulating circadian dopamine 1 receptor
function ex vivo and in vivo. We will selective knockdown CRYs in the NAc and assess D1 receptor function by
whole-cell patch clamp physiology by monitoring voltage-gated K+ currents ex vivo and by fiber photometry to
monitor D1 receptor signal transduction dynamics in vivo. In year 2, we will use ex vivo approaches with selective
knockdown of CRYs to assess DA-dependent NAc excitability. We will further determine circadian-dependent
VTA dopamine release and NAc neuronal activity changes in response to aversive stimuli in vivo by monitoring
calcium signaling with fiber photometry. This study will allow us to dissect mechanistic, circadian regulation of
NAc neurophysiological response and dopamine receptor function. The overall aim of this project is to determine
the role of CRY in regulating excitability and function of the NAc and how this regulation controls NAc response
to aversive stimuli. This proposal will provide translationally relevant information about circadian regulation of
basic mechanistic underpinnings of NAc dopamine function and behaviorally relevant, neurobiological response
to aversive stimuli. This work will further provide a foundation for understanding how circadian-driven NAc
changes underlie susceptibility to mood disorders such as depression."

Each year in the US, over 70,000 children are hospitalized with sepsis. Of the nearly 90% of children who
survive sepsis, many face physical, emotional, and cognitive morbidity following sepsis hospitalization. Indeed,
recent work by the proposed project’s research team—including through support from PI Carlton’s NCATS KL2
award—demonstrated that 1 in 20 children who survive sepsis develop new chronic respiratory failure (defined
as supplemental oxygen dependence and/or invasive or non-invasive ventilator dependence) within 6 months
of discharge. This rate of new chronic respiratory failure was nearly 2.5 times higher than in matched, non-
septic, critically ill children. The proposed project will bring novel data to address several important gaps in
understanding in order to mitigate and prevent the development of new chronic respiratory failure after sepsis.
Using national multi-payer data (commercial insurance & Medicaid), the research team will characterize the
patterns of onset of new chronic respiratory failure after sepsis. Secondly, the team will identify potentially
modifiable factors associated with onset of this new morbidity.
Specific aims include:
Aim 1: To test the extent to which new chronic respiratory failure develops in-hospital versus post-discharge
among children who survive sepsis hospitalization.
Aim 2: To establish the antecedent and sepsis-specific risk factors associated with the onset of new chronic
respiratory failure following sepsis.
No studies, to the team’s knowledge, have described the time of onset of chronic respiratory failure after sepsis
(i.e., developed during sepsis hospitalization vs. after discharge), nor assessed the explanatory risk factors for
its development. The team anticipates that findings from the proposed project will fill critical knowledge gaps
about the epidemiology and risk factors for postsepsis chronic respiratory failure that are necessary to enhance
recovery. This work will provide key preliminary data for an R01 addressing the prevention, treatment, and
management of sepsis-associated chronic respiratory failure among children."
10807970,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of this proposal is to delineate the role of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP
(Epac1) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) disease. IPF is characterized by progressive scarring and fibrosis
of the lungs that results in life-threatening complications such as respiratory failure. Unfortunately, there is no
cure for IPF, and our aging world population requires a vast majority of new therapeutic targets and strategies
for treating patients with this fatal disease.
Most studies in fibrosis focused on increased cAMP to inhibit fibroblast proliferation and differentiation through
the PKA pathway, however, neither the regulation of the expression nor the contribution of Epac1 to IPF
pathophysiological processes are well defined. Thus, it is interesting to direct the research by specifically
regulating the actions of the Epac enzymes independently of PKA in IPF. Recently, the compound AM-001 has
been identified and characterized as a novel and potent Epac1 pharmacological inhibitor. AM-001 selectively
inhibits Epac1 catalytic activity and displays cardioprotective properties. Such findings reflect the need to assess
the key role of Epac1 and its specific inhibitor AM-001 in pulmonary fibrosis (PF) disease. Our preliminary
studies show that the expression of Epac1 is significantly increased in lung tissue from IPF patients, IPF diseased
fibroblasts, and bleomycin (BLM)-challenged mice compared to controls. Furthermore, Epac1 deficiency mice
are protected against BLM induced-lung injury and fibrosis. Furthermore, the knockdown and inhibition of Epac1
by AM-001 attenuate normal and IPF fibroblasts proliferation and the expression of pro-fibrotic markers, TGFβ
and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In addition, AM-001 significantly decreases lung fibrosis in vivo in the BLM-induced PF
mouse model. RNA sequencing data analyses show key components of the pro-fibrotic genes signature of IPF
in AM-001-treated NHLF cells. Based on these data our overall hypothesis is that Epac1 is an important regulator
of the fibroblast's pathological state in PF and that Epac1 can serve as a potential therapeutic target by AM-001
for PF disease. In this proposal, we will extend these preliminary findings by testing the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: To define the expression pattern of Epac1 in humans and mice with PF.
Specific Aim 2: To define the mechanisms of Epac1 function in fibroblast activation.
Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the effectiveness of a novel Epac1-specific inhibitor AM-001 in a mouse model of
pulmonary fibrosis. Collectively, the proposed studies will help increase our understanding of Epac1 role in lung
remodeling associated with aged-PF pathogenesis and may lead to the identification of new potential targets to
block the progression of this deadly disease."
10807973,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Extensive research has established clear, strong associations between human social relationships and health
and illness. A lack of social connection, including isolation, loneliness, and conflict, is related to the onset and
progression of cardiovascular disease, some forms of cancer, diabetes, and obesity among other acute and
chronic health conditions. Neurodegenerative diseases have been relatively overlooked in this research
despite having adverse effects on patients’ functioning that may disrupt a range of social relationships.
Huntington’s disease (HD) is an exemplar neurodegenerative disease that it is a fully penetrant, autosomal
dominant condition characterized by progressive cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and motor impairments that
have the potential to negatively affect family functioning and community engagement. HD is likely to place a
particular burden on the parent-child relationship given that the disease is most often diagnosed in middle
adulthood, a period that includes the primary years for child rearing and parenting, and offspring of parents
with HD have a 50% risk of inheriting the disease themselves. As children watch their parents’ disease
progress, they observe their own potential future and may be tasked with significant caretaking demands.
Notably, qualitative research highlights significant impairments to social relationships experienced by both HD
parents and their offspring within and outside of the family. In response to PAR-21-145, the proposed study will
address the gap in empirical research by documenting levels of the structure, function and quality of social
connectedness in HD families and examine potential mechanistic targets for behavioral intervention. Our
preliminary data emphasize the negative impact of HD on social connectedness, including the quality of
communication, of parents with HD and their offspring. Further, our previous research and preliminary data
suggest two potential mechanisms linking social relationships and psychological and physical health outcomes
for parents with HD and their offspring: executive function (EF; e.g., working memory) and emotion regulation
(ER) in response to stress (e.g., cognitive reappraisal, problem solving). We will examine the associations
between social connectedness and quality of life and impairment in cognitive and emotional function in a
sample of 200 patients with HD and their adolescent and young adult offspring (n = 200). A sample of parents
without neurodegenerative disease (n = 200) and their adolescent and young adult offspring (n = 200) will
serve as a comparison sample."
10804755,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc), or scleroderma, is an autoimmune systemic disease with no cure and the highest
case-specific mortality of all rheumatic diseases. SSc is 3-4 times more prevalent amongst Veterans, partially
due to service-related exposures. Skin is by far the most commonly affected organ, and skin fibrosis, the
hardening and tightening of the skin, is a hallmark feature of SSc. Although skin fibrosis is a key marker of
overall disease severity and a significant cause of morbidity and impaired quality of life, tracking cutaneous
SSc remains an important challenge. The clinical standard for assessing SSc severity, the modified Rodnan
skin score, estimates the degree of skin thickening by pinching, but suffers high interobserver variability,
inability to distinguish treatable active disease from damage, and insufficient sensitivity to change over time.
The lack of reliable measures to track cutaneous disease activity can significantly delay treatment decisions
due to missed opportunities for early intervention to positively alter the disease course.
We propose to address this unmet need for cutaneous biomarkers of SSc with the Myoton, a user-friendly
cellphone-sized device that we have pioneered as a reliable measure of skin sclerosis in graft-versus-host
disease. The Myoton enables precise, reliable, and reproducible measure of mechanical attributes of the skin
through rapid and simultaneous acquisition of five parameters. Our team has validated the Myoton against
conventional clinical assessments, longitudinal therapeutic response, and in tissue models. Importantly, our
existing standardized protocols enable novice Myoton users achieve high intra- and inter-observer reliability in
clinical multicenter studies.
In this proposal, we aim to validate skin mechanical parameters measured by the Myoton a practical cutaneous
biomarker that is linked to the underlying pathology of SSc. We will enroll an observational cohort of 100
Veterans across the full spectrum of cutaneous SSc severity, and 100 matched healthy controls. Over the
course of twelve months, we will acquire Myoton measurements, clinical assessments including the modified
Rodnan skin score and standardized SSc-specific physician- and patient-reported outcome measures, high
frequency ultrasound images, and skin biopsies. First, we will determine the associations between Myoton
measurements and clinical phenotypes of cutaneous SSc. Second, we will determine the quantitative
relationship between Myoton measurements and structural alterations, correlating to both skin thickness
measured by high frequency ultrasound, and tissue pathology markers from histology. Finally, we will assess
how changes in Myoton measurements over time reflect changes in cutaneous SSc severity. We will also
evaluate the ability of early time point Myoton measurements to predict the one-year clinical progression.
In summary, we will validate Myoton’s direct quantification of skin mechanics as a measure of cutaneous SSc.
This will pave the way for skin mechanics to serve as a diagnostic biomarker for practical, objective staging
and response measure of this debilitating disease that greatly affects our Veterans’ lives."
10807984,"Contextual Determinants of Sexual Minority Health in the United States
 R01 Application Summary/Abstract
 Kara Joyner (PI) and Wendy Manning (Co-I)
Researchers have long documented health disparities for sexual minority populations (or sexual diverse
populations) and they are beginning to document them for gender minority populations (or gender diverse
populations). These health disparities remain largely intractable because researchers have not been able to
rigorously capture the putative mechanism behind them: stigma. The minority stress perspective posits that
sexual minority populations, like racial/ethnic minority populations, experience a higher prevalence of adverse
health outcomes than heterosexual populations due to their stigmatized status in society. Researchers testing
this perspective have increasingly measured stigma at the societal level or “structural stigma,” a concept that
captures both social climate (public attitudes towards sexual/gender minorities) and legal climate (laws and
policies relevant to sexual/gender minorities). Researchers have been hampered in their ability to adequately
assess the effects of structural stigma due to the design of most population-based surveys that include questions
on sexual minority status and health. Few of these surveys permit researchers to measure stigma at multiple
levels. Another limitation of these surveys is that they are cross-sectional, precluding a consideration of how
exposure to structural stigma changes over the life course. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to
Adult Health (Add Health) has the necessary criteria to rigorously investigate the effects of structural stigma on
the health outcomes of sexual minority respondents, including a formal and regulated mechanism for producing
and disseminating contextual data. Add Health users interested in testing minority stress and intersectionality
perspectives will have unprecedented opportunities to examine how various outcomes are associated with
structural stigma for sexual minority respondents and how the associations differ across subgroups. Aim 1 of
this project is to create a contextual database that researchers can use to better study the effects of structural
stigma. Specifically, this database will include measures of social and legal climate relevant to sexual minorities
that correspond to the tract, county, and state levels before or around the time of Waves 3, 4, and 5. This
database will also include measures of structural racism since many sexual minorities are also racial/ethnic
minorities. We will convene an advisory team to ensure we have the best measures of structural stigma and
racism. Aim 2 will examine with this contextual database how state-level measures of legal climate are
associated with self-rated health and health biomarkers among Add Health respondents and consider how these
associations differ by key factors (e.g., gender, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity). This database will
promote research on health disparities for sexual and racial minority populations that is both rigorous and
innovative. Research made possible by the creation of this contextual database has the potential to inform
policies and interventions that improve the health of sexual and racial minority populations, including subgroups
of these populations, ensuring all populations have equal opportunities for long, healthy, and productive lives."

10930149,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Nicotine vaping among adolescents has surged in prevalence over the past decade. Vaping poses clear
health risks, is highly addictive, and leads to the use of combustible cigarettes. Our multi-disciplinary team,
which includes expertise in youth participatory approaches, substance use prevention, nicotine use and
cessation, and statistics, has developed an innovative school-based approach that promotes positive health
behavior while also addressing academic standards, and thus incorporates both the academic mission of
schools and youth health. YES-CAN! (Youth Engaged Strategies to Change Adolescent Norms) integrates the
following evidence-based strategies: youth-adult collaboration; youth-developed narrative videos to convey
health messages; peer leaders as change agents; and sustained implementation to change the normative
environment. It rests on evidence that adolescents are more likely to change attitudes, norms, and behaviors
when exposed to messages developed and delivered by peer role models rather than teachers, parents, or
other adults.
 For this pilot/feasibility study, two middle/high school communities will receive the intervention. In each
school community, we will implement a credit-earning high school class in which a trained teacher will deliver
the one-year classroom-based program to 25-30 high school students, who will produce 6-8 short videos
intended to increase refusal skills; promote stress management and positive coping; change social norms;
prevent vaping initiation; and promote vaping cessation among current users. Videos will use a narrative
approach and integrate known determinants of vaping. High school students will collaborate with the teacher
and researchers to develop discussion guides and skills-building activities based on best practices for
substance use prevention. In 6-8 eight sessions, high school students will deliver their videos to all students in
the associated middle school. A text messaging component will reinforce and boost the effectiveness of the
classroom sessions.
 Our overarching hypothesis is that this intensive approach that involves both middle and high school
students in the same community will result in a new normative environment and a reduction in youth vaping.
Aims for this pilot/feasibility study are to: 1) Determine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the
YES-CAN! program; and 2) Determine the feasibility and acceptability of the research protocols that will be
used in a future efficacy trial. Primary efficacy outcomes include vaping ever use, past month use, daily use,
susceptibility, behavioral intentions, and vaping-related knowledge, attitudes, perceived norms, resistance
skills, and self-efficacy. Additionally, for high school students who participate in the intervention development
and delivery, outcomes include positive youth development. Outcomes will be measured over a 13 month
period."
10808621,"PROJECT SUMMARY
T cells responding to persistent antigen during cancer and chronic infection develop a hyporesponsive
phenotype, while T cells responding to self-antigen during type 1 diabetes (T1D) maintain function and eliminate
pancreatic beta cells. My co-mentor previously identified a transcriptional program induced by persistent
stimulation that was shared by mouse and human T cells responding to chronic viral infections and tumors. This
program was linked to the Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) and Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4 Group
A (NR4A) families of transcription factors (TFs), which are potently induced during chronic stimulation. This
transcriptional program elicited a characteristic pattern of inhibitory receptor expression and also directly reduced
expression of genes encoding effector proteins. In new preliminary studies, I found that only a subset of T cells
specific for self-antigen in the pancreas of NOD mice induced this exhaustion associated transcriptional program.
Cells with increased levels of exhaustion associated TFs had lower expression of genes encoding effector
proteins. These data indicate that the canonical exhaustion program is weakly induced in the autoreactive T cell
pool during diabetes and is a potential target to lessen effects of T cells during autoimmune disease. Based on
these data, my central hypothesis is that expression and activity of the exhaustion program determines the
function of self- antigen specific CD8+ T cells during type 1 diabetes. I predict that 1) the exhaustion associated
program can be activated to limit autoreactive T cell function and 2) the induction of this program is determined
by TCR affinity for self-antigen. I propose two aims to test these predictions during T1D using NOD mice and
human T cells. The expected results of this study will address unanswered questions about the fundamental
mechanisms controlling T cell activity during autoimmune disease and determine the potential to limit
autoimmune disease by controlling exhaustion associated transcriptional programs."

This is a 5-year K23 career development award for Dr. Jessica Cohan, a board-certified general and colorectal
surgeon and early career investigator whose research focus is optimizing person-centered surgical care for
older adults. As the population ages, an increasing number of older adults will face major, non-urgent surgery,
associated with significant risk of cognitive, functional, and physical decline. Traditional surgical consultations
do not include a discussion of the goals for surgery, i.e., what surgery can and cannot accomplish for the
patient. Only by identifying clear, realistic goals for surgery can patients and families meaningfully deliberate
about whether surgery is worth its burdens and risks. This proposal addresses a critical need to support older
adults, families, and surgeons in discussing the goals for surgery during outpatient consultations. Dr. Cohan
has developed a prototype intervention that consists of question prompts used by older adults, families, and
surgeons to identify clear, realistic goals for surgery during consultations. In this proposal, Dr. Cohan will use
the NIH Stage Model to 1) refine the intervention with input from key stakeholders, 2) adapt the intervention to
the clinical context through field testing, and 3) measure the efficacy of the intervention on treatment goal
documentation during surgical consultations. This work aligns with Dr. Cohan’s career development plan,
which provides a clear path to independence by providing the means to develop expertise in 1) stakeholder
engagement, 2) clinical intervention design, 3) intervention testing for aging populations using the NIH Stage
Model, and 4) leadership in aging research. The proposed research will provide novel insights into how person-
centered surgical care can be achieved for older adults and will result in a novel clinical intervention ready for a
multi-center trial. Thus, this work will directly impact the health and wellbeing of the growing population of older
adults facing major, non-urgent surgery.
To accomplish these endeavors, Dr. Cohan is supported by a highly skilled, multidisciplinary team of mentors
with expertise in geriatrics and aging-related research (Dr. Supiano), behavioral intervention development and
clinical trials (Dr. Ozanne), and patient-surgeon communication and stakeholder engagement (Dr. Schwarze).
The mentor team is complemented by three skilled and dedicated advisors with expertise in biostatistics,
caregiver research, and pragmatic clinical trials. The proposal leverages the rich research and clinical
resources of the University of Utah and provides a clear path by which Dr. Cohan will fulfill her career goal of
becoming a leader at the intersection of surgery and aging research, developing and disseminating clinical
interventions that advance high-quality, person-centered surgical care for older adults."
10808810,"I am a physician-scientist dedicated to caring for people with schizophrenia (SZ) and studying the
pathophysiology of SZ to identify disease-modifying therapeutic interventions. Converging evidence in the field
points to abnormalities in synapses, and perhaps a reduction in specific synaptic subtypes in distinct cortical
layers due to ongoing synapse elimination, that may result in abnormal neuronal signaling that interfere with
cognition. However, methodological limitations have impeded progress in testing the neuroanatomical basis of
this hypothesis. In this project, a novel multiplex imaging method, Array Tomography, will be applied to a large
cohort of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) sections of postmortem brain samples from individuals with
SZ and controls in combination with transcriptomic data to test whether individuals with SZ a have a lower
synaptic density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in layer 3 (L3) of the DLPFC that correlate with high
C4A gene expression. Specific aims include: [1] Comparing both the synaptic density of excitatory and
inhibitory synapses (and ratios of excitatory to inhibitory synapses) in DLPFC L3 from 55 SZ and 55 control
donors, to test whether the synaptic density of either (or both) primary synaptic subtypes differs between SZ
and controls, while also testing whether an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic density could be the
basis of the imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory signals that may be disrupting cognition (E/I imbalance).

inhibitory synaptic density in the same samples in layer 5, and [3] calculating the correlation between
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic density in DLPFC L3 and C4A gene expression, as measured by bulk RNA-
sequencing [RNA-seq]. Demonstrating a strong correlation between high C4A gene expression and low
synaptic density would provide supporting evidence for the excessive synaptic pruning hypothesis and C4A
gene expression as a primary mediator of synaptic density. Work on this project will provide empirical data for
leading hypotheses in the field while supporting my Career Development. I will gain extensive experience in
using Array Tomography to study detailed synaptic architecture and work towards identifying critical factors
that regulate synapses in SZ by coupling with transcriptomic data. This experience will build on my prior
experience so I can work on the underlying synaptic pathology in SZ using a combination of postmortem tissue
and in vivo model systems as an independent investigator. Goals of this Career Development Award will be
overseen by my primary mentor, Professor Urban, expert in -omis analyses in psychiatric disorders. An
outstanding Mentoring Team at Stanford University will support my career development in gaining experience
in using Array Tomography, bioinformatic analyses, deepening my knowledge of synaptic biology, while
building the publication record and preliminary data for a successful transition to an independence."
10794445,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hearing loss is one of the most common age-related diseases. Untreated hearing loss is associated with in-
creased risks of negative social-emotional health outcomes including loneliness and depression. Why hearing
loss is associated with poor social-emotional health is unknown. The primary treatment for hearing loss is hear-
ing aids, but only 30% of adults with hearing loss use hearing aids. Whether hearing aids reduce the risk of
poor social-emotional health is equivocal, and if they do moderate the risk, how they do is unknown. In order to
improve the effectiveness of audiologic interventions in reducing the risk of poor social-emotional health, it is crit-
ical to understand why hearing loss is associated with poor social-emotional health, whether the mechanisms of
this association are hearing-related, and how hearing aid use moderates the risk of poor social-emotional health
outcomes. This study addresses these questions by introducing a theoretical framework of hearing-related be-
havior and novel methods to quantify it in the real world. Hearing-related behavior is proposed to comprise both
auditory lifestyle, or how acoustically demanding and diverse the soundscapes a listener encounters in daily life
are, and communication engagement, or how well a listener is able to engage in conversation within sound-
scapes in daily life. In the proposed study, these domains are measured using long-form audio recordings and
ecological momentary assessments collected from the daily lives of listeners with hearing loss who do and do not
use hearing aids. Then, the relationship between these domains and social-emotional health is determined. In
Aim 1, auditory lifestyle differences between the two groups is quantified by measuring auditory lifestyle demand
(proportions of different types of soundscapes) and diversity (predictability of soundscapes) for each participant.
Long-form audio recordings of daily life are analyzed using machine learning classification to precisely character-
ize the soundscapes of each listener. Sound recordings are also paired with ecological momentary assessment
to add context. Whether hearing aid users spend more time in demanding (e.g., speech-in-noise, group conversa-
tion, unfamiliar talkers) and diverse (less predictable) soundscapes than non-hearing aid users is determined. In
Aim 2, recordings from the real world are identified where participants engaged in conversation. Conversations
are analyzed for utterance length and conversational turn rate, two measures of communication engagement.
Differences in engagement between hearing aid users and non-hearing aid users are determined. In Aim 3,
participants complete standardized and momentary measures of social-emotional health (depression, loneliness,
quality of life). The association between hearing-related behavior, hearing aid use, and social-emotional health is
determined. Findings from this study will determine how social-emotional health and hearing loss are related and
how clinical audiology can best promote positive behavior change that reduces the risks of loneliness and de-
pression in people with hearing loss. This study addresses goals of the NIDCD Strategic Plan by using machine
learning to develop new outcome measures that will improve clinical practice and intervention effectiveness."

10812453,"There is a need for an enhanced and expanded hematology research trainee pipeline to fit the changing
landscape of the 21st century. Dr. Hoots and colleagues from the Division of Blood Diseases and Resources
(DBDR) at extramural NHLBI reported in Blood in 2015 that “the total number of investigator-initiated (R01)
grants that the NHLBI DBDR funds (almost all of which have nonmalignant hematologic science as their
emphasis) has declined over the past decade, as have the number of unique R01 investigators.” They called
for enhancement of trainee career development, a reinvigoration of hematology research technology and
redefinition of roles of the hematology physician-scientist.
The Pittsburgh Blood Science Center at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine has responded to the
hematology training need with a full-featured training program in translational hematology science. The
program combines cross-departmental strength in laboratory blood research, innovative, well-developed
degree programs in clinical research and entrepreneurship, and translationally motivated hematology
physician-scientist faculty research mentors with over $28 million in current fiscal year total cost NIH funding.
Each trainee will attend a core T32 training structure in place already for heart, lung, vascular and sleep
researchers at the Pittsburgh Heart, Lung, Blood and Vascular Medicine Institute, including an intensive two-
week “Fundamentals of Bench Research” course, grant writing workshops, academic survival skills conference
series, reimbursed grant review program, and K-to-R transition workshop.
An individualized career development plan is developed from a menu of options for research experience and
degree programs to enhance their translational research skills:
  Master of Science (MS) in Clinical Research from our Institute for Clinical Research Education
  Master of Public Health (MPH) from our Graduate School of Public Health
  Master of Science in Medical Product Engineering (MS-MPE) from our Swanson School of Engineering
  Master of Business Administration (MBA) in entrepreneurship and product development from Carnegie
 Mellon University Tepper School of Business
  FDA, NIH and American Society of Hematology externships for regulatory and infrastructure experience
  In-house internships in drug development regulatory expertise
  Laboratory training in translationally-oriented basic science labs
  Apprenticeship with in-house leaders of multicenter clinical trials
  Experience with computational biologists and other “big data” researchers
  Skills for transitioning to early stage funded faculty researcher positions
  Advanced scientific expertise on the role of emerging inflammatory biology on hemostasis, thrombosis,
 sickle cell disease and other vascular biology
The research training program impact is augmented by an updated, USGME-approved hematology-
concentrated clinical fellowship training program that offers training for evolving roles in health-system clinical
hematology, transfusion medicine, hemostasis and thrombosis, and hematopathology."
10812455,"We propose to validate and export to the aging field a novel tool to measure a person’s pace of
biological aging: DunedinPoAm4x. The measure will be useful for basic aging research and also for
testing whether an intervention has slowed a person’s pace of aging. We began this work under NIA
R01 AG032282 (Belsky et al PNAS 2015). Over two decades, we tracked a 19-biomarker panel of the
physiological functions of 1,000 individuals born the same year (1972-73) in the population-
representative Dunedin Study. Our goal has been to measure, in people the same chronological age,
variation in biological aging defined per geroscience theory as: gradual, progressive decline
simultaneously affecting multiple organ systems. We tracked declines in the cardiovascular, metabolic,
pulmonary, renal, dental, hepatic, and immune functions of participants by repeating biomarkers at
ages 26, 32, 38 and 45 years (94% retention). Growth-curve modelling of this one-of-a-kind dataset
yielded a pace-of-aging metric that quantified how slowly or rapidly each participant in our cohort had
been aging (Elliott et al Nature Aging, 2021). The next stage of the work applied machine-learning to
participants’ age-45 whole-genome DNA methylation data, training an algorithm on the pace-of-aging
metric to derive a score called DunedinPoAm4x (Pace of Aging methylation, 4 waves). This technical
advance means that a person’s pace of aging can be estimated from just a single blood sample, and
the metric can be exported to any research sample that has blood methylation data. Previously we had
reported validation checks on a preliminary version of DunedinPoAm, up to age 38, showing that
people who had faster methylation pace of aging scores subsequently experienced advanced facial
age, declines in cognitive and physical functioning, chronic diseases, and early mortality (Belsky et al
eLife 2020). Our Aims propose a systematic out-of-sample validation evaluation of DunedinPoAm4x in
19+ data sets, testing its applicability in older adults, young people, race/ethnic groups, and several
countries. Each Aim will also test existing leading methylation clocks for comparison. Our overarching
hypothesis is that DunedinPoAm4x will characterize biological aging with greater precision than the
clocks, and in so doing will bring added information value over and above the clocks. In addition to aim-
specific publications, we plan a final, synthesis publication. We will deliver, to basic scientists and
intervention researchers, a reliable, valid, open-access measure of how rapidly a person has been
aging."

10836409,"Project Abstract/Summary
Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, with disparities in survival by race and
ethnicity. Nearly all stages of OC require aggressive treatment, such that 90% of women diagnosed receive
chemotherapy. First-line treatment includes surgery and six cycles of platinum- and taxane-based
chemotherapy. Timely and successful completion of chemotherapy is critical, as delayed or reduced
chemotherapy dosage for OC is associated with decreased survival; yet chemotherapy dose delays and dose
reductions are common. The primary reason for dose delays and reductions is chemotoxicity, including
neuropathy, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, depression, arthralgia, and gastrointestinal toxicities. Muscle loss is
an additional consequence of chemotherapy in women with OC. Strategies to manage chemotoxicities include
nutrition and exercise. Our team has extensive experience in leading multi-site nutrition and exercise
interventions in women with OC and relevant experience with trials specifically addressing chemotherapy
completion rates. We will leverage this expertise to address a critical gap: how to reduce chemotoxicity and
treatment delays in women with OC. We propose to conduct a multi-site randomized trial of an 18-week
medical nutrition therapy and exercise intervention vs. attention control in a racially and ethnically diverse
sample of 200 women newly diagnosed with OC (stage I-IV) and initiating curative intent chemotherapy to
assess the effect of the intervention on: Aim 1: Relative dose intensity (RDI), an integrated measure of
chemotherapy dose delays and reductions; Aim 2: Patient-reported chemotoxicities including neuropathy,
cognitive function, depression, fatigue, arthralgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances; Aim 3: Body composition
and muscle mass assessed via CT scans and urinary D3‐Creatine dilution method; and Aim 4: Long-term
lifestyle behaviors, body composition, patient-reported chemotoxicities, and health care utilization assessed 3-
months post-intervention and 12-months post-diagnosis. We hypothesize women randomized to intervention
will have higher RDI as compared to women in the attention control arm because of fewer patient-reported
chemotoxicities. The intervention will result in attenuated declines in body composition compared with attention
control, and women randomized to the intervention will maintain healthy lifestyle behaviors long-term, in turn
favorably impacting lingering chemotoxicities and body composition, resulting in less health care utilization
compared with attention control. Strengths of our approach is that baseline, follow-up visits and the intervention
duration are timed with standard of care in that first-line chemotherapy is completed at ~18 weeks (when our
primary endpoint will be assessed) with women undergoing repeat imaging assessments at this timepoint and
3 months later. Positive results would accelerate a paradigm shift with OC patients receiving nutrition and
exercise programming as standard of care in tandem with chemotherapy treatment to minimize chemotoxicity
and optimize treatment dose delivery for a curative outcome."
10813176,"Project Summary/Abstract
Multiple Myeloma (MM) causes devastating bone destruction and protracted suppression of bone formation that
markedly increases fracture risk, impacts mortality and contributes to MM cell drug resistance. MM bone lesions
rarely heal in most patients, so that severe bone pain and fracture risk persist. Currently, there are no safe bone
anabolic agents approved for MM bone disease (MMBD). We showed that the multi-domain protein p62
(sequestosome-1) is a major contributor to MMBD through its two major functions. It is a signaling hub for multiple
signaling pathways that increase MM cell growth, bone destruction OB suppression in MM. p62 also mediates
pro-survival functions in MM cells as a cargo receptor for ubiquitin-mediated autophagy. The p62-ZZ domain
(p62-ZZ), plays a key role in both these functions, and is the focus of this proposal. We, with colleagues at
University of Pittsburgh, developed XRK3F2 (XRK), a small molecule that binds p62-ZZ. We found that XRK
induced dramatic new bone formation in MM-bearing mice, allowed MM patient-derived bone marrow stromal
cells (MM-BMSC) to differentiate to functional OB, induced MM cell death and enhanced the anti-MM effects of
Bortezomib (Btz) and Carfilzomib, proteasome inhibitors (PIs) used for MM treatment. However, the mechanisms
responsible for XRK’s effects in MM are unclear. Recently, our collaborators found that p62-ZZ is a high-affinity
N-recognin for N-terminal argininylated proteins generated by the N-end rule pathway, and that XRK acts as a
high affinity degron for p62- ZZ, mimicking endogenous N-end degrons. The N-end rule pathway (N-ERP) is a
proteolytic system that protects cells from the proteotoxic stress of misfolded proteins (MPs) in the cytosol that
normally are targeted for ER-associated degradation, and shuttles them to proteasome and autophagy-mediated
degradation pathways. Excess MPs trigger release of chaperones from the ER that are then N-arginylated and
bind MPs. The N-R protein complexes bind either the UBR box of N-recognins for subsequent proteosomal
degradation, or p62-ZZ for autophagic proteolysis. We recently found that saturating p62-ZZ with XRK increased
PI-induced MM cell death via necroptosis, even in PI-resistant cells. Thus, p62-ZZ serves as the molecular
switch for necroptotic vs. apoptotic cell death pathways in MM cells. However, how XRK’s actions as a
high-affinity N-degron that binds p62-ZZ are uncharacterized in MM or BMSCs. We will use in vitro and in
vivo approaches to determine; Aim 1: The mechanisms responsible for XRK’s relief of the suppressed OB
differentiation in BMSC exposed to MM cells or TNF, and the contributions of inflammatory cytokines to this
process. Aim 2: The mechanisms responsible and relative contributions of XRK’s effects on osteocytes in
MMBD. Aim 3: The importance of necroptosis-mediated cell death in MM, and its regulation by the p62-ZZ/N-
ERP and proteasome pathways. Aim 4: The in vivo effects of combining XRK targeting of p62-ZZ +/- PI treatment
on MMBD and healing MM bone lesions. These studies should provide important new information on the p62-
ZZ/N-ERP pathway as a therapeutic target to build bone and decrease tumor growth in MMBD."
10813178,"Single Cell Tracking of 3D Epigenetic Landscape Evolution During Embryonic Development
An important question to cell biology is how cells break the symmetry during mitotic divisions. During mammalian
pre-implantation embryonic development (PED), how the first cell fate decision is made remains unclear and is
crucial for the understanding of how specific gene regulations can guide the life of a cell. Epigenetic modifications
including chromatin remodeling are early events during PED. Histone methylation at different residues can recruit
differential sets of chromatin remodeling complexes to regulate chromatin structures and silence/activate gene
expressions accordingly. These histone methylations and their combinations at different genomic loci can serve
as codes to determine the overall gene expression profile and phenotypic outcomes. However, it is still not
understood how histone methylations and hence chromatin structures at specific loci are dynamically regulated
during PED in which cells undergo a heterogeneous modulation at single cell levels. In this proposal, we will
harness the power of directed evolution and high-throughput screening method to systematically develop
specific/sensitive FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) biosensors for the monitoring of crucial histone
methylations in single cells. We will further develop and apply the mapping RNA-chromatin interactions in single
cells (sciMARGI) to identify crucial RNA-genome interaction sites during PED. We will then employ the
endonuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9), small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and split FPs to identify and track the
positons of specific loci crucial for embryonic cell differentiation. Ultimately, we will apply our controllable
epigenetic modulators to guide the histone modulations at specific loci and elucidate their role in determining cell
fates during PED. Given the importance of epigenetic modifications at different loci, the success of the project
should have transformative impact in understanding the role of locus-specific epigenetics in determining the cell
fate during PED. Accordingly, three aims are proposed: Aim 1. Spatiotemporal imaging of crucial histone
methylations in single live cells and during PED; Aim 2. Visualize the locus-specific histone modifications during
PED; Aim 3. Reprogram the locus-specific histone modifications during PED. While the focus of this proposal is
to develop tools targeting histone methylations and chromatin structures at specific loci and differentiation
outcomes, the strategies and approaches can be extended to monitor, in principle, any other epigenetic
modification in single cells, including but not limited to histone acetylation and phosphorylation. The results from
this project can also lead directly to the dynamic nuclear atlas illustrating how specific histone codes are
encrypted in an integrative manner for the regulation of life."
10785461,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall survival rate for children with high-risk liver cancer, including metastatic or relapse/refractory
hepatoblastoma (HB), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and HB with HCC features (HBC) is below 50%. The
best odds for survival for patients with these cancers is complete surgical resection with negative margins, but
this is not achievable at diagnosis for most patients. Instead, high-risk patients are treated with combinations of
chemotherapy and surgery, where chemotherapy is used to reduce tumor burdens before surgery and to
eliminate residual cancer cells after surgery. The low survival rates for high-risk liver cancers are associated with
chemoresistance and improving these survival rates requires alternative therapies to target chemoresistant
cancer cells in combination with chemotherapy.
We propose a comprehensive approach to characterize chemoresistant cancer cells in children with high-risk
liver cancers, design technologies to detect these cancers at diagnosis, discover and establish therapies to target
these chemoresistant cancer cells, and use patient-derived models to test personalized treatment combinations
before prescribing them to high-risk patients. We propose to proceed with three aims. First, we will establish
chemoresistant models and molecularly and clinically characterize them. Second, we will use molecular data to
enable the identification of chemoresistant cancers at diagnosis utilizing prospectively collected specimens from
a major clinical trial. We will use personalized models to predict treatment response in prospectively enrolled
cancer patients and determine if chemoresistance can be detected at diagnosis. Finally, we will identify and
investigate targeted combination therapies in patient-derived models.
Conceptual innovations in our proposal include building a pediatric liver cancer atlas of molecularly and clinically
characterized cell types that could be used to predict patient responses to therapy at diagnosis, as well as
mapping out the drivers of chemoresistance in pediatric liver cancer. The study will evaluate the largest cohort
of patient-derived models for pediatric liver cancers and the utility of these models as pre-clinical tools to develop
and evaluate therapies for children with high-risk liver cancers. If successful, this study will help efforts to
transform the diagnosis and treatment of children with high-risk liver cancers leading to dramatically improved
outcomes."
10815559,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Difficulty adhering to prescribed health behaviors significantly hinders the long-term benefits of lifestyle weight
management programs, leading to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and early mortality.
Although physical activity (PA) is one of the best predictors of sustained weight loss, long-term adherence to PA
remains poor in adults with overweight or obesity enrolled in lifestyle weight management programs. Absence of
accessible, effective, theory-based programs that account for each person’s values and preferences remains a
major barrier. Thus, novel, person-centered, and scalable interventions are urgently needed to effectively
promote PA adherence in adults with overweight or obesity to enhance weight loss maintenance and CVD
prevention. The overall objective of this K01 Career Development Award is to expand and pilot test a theory-
based PA program (called MOVE+) designed to enhance motivation in adults with overweight or obesity enrolled
in a lifestyle weight management program. First, I will engage stakeholders to assess the initial acceptability of
the MOVE+ intervention components. User-centered design testing will occur over 2 cycles: 1) initial stakeholder
review of MOVE+ component design and content, and 2) a 12-week, single-arm field trial to pilot test delivery of
the MOVE+ program. Second, I will evaluate the feasibility of delivering MOVE+ within an existing lifestyle weight
management program (Prevent T2). I will recruit 80 adults with BMI 25-45 kg/m2 to receive 6 months (with 12
month follow-up) of remote delivery of the Prevent T2 program, integrated with the MOVE+ program. To isolate
which MOVE+ components are “active ingredients”, I will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy and
conduct a cluster randomized 2^3 full factorial pilot trial. Eight clusters of n=10 participants will be randomly
assigned to a combination of 3, MOVE+ components. My long-term goal is to develop an independent research
program that focuses on the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases, including obesity and CVD, by
designing and disseminating theory-based, optimized PA interventions that promote sustained behavior change.
Along with my mentorship team (Drs. Catenacci, Masters, Kwan, Conroy, Pfammatter, Pyle, and Ms. Barnard),
I have developed a comprehensive training plan to support this career goal. My primary training goals include to
develop expertise in: 1) the application of behavior change theory to PA intervention design, 2) dissemination
and implementation science, 3) the use of novel frameworks and efficient trial designs, and 4) human clinical
trial design and conduct. My past experience, complemented by my expert mentoring team, a robust training
plan, and an exceptional environment (the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus) will ensure my
success. Completion of this K01 will generate critical preliminary data needed to support a competitive R01
application and will serve as both a superb training opportunity and as an original and meaningful scientific
contribution to propel my career goal of becoming an emerging leader in PA and obesity research."
10815564,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background: Cancer originates from genetic alterations that lead to changes in gene
expression programs that promote tumor survival, growth, motility and inhibits
differentiation and apoptosis. The mRNAs from this oncogenic gene expression program
must be exported to the cytoplasm to be translated into protein in order to promote
tumorigenesis. Whether there is regulation of export of tumor specific mRNAs and the
potential proteins involved in this process is unknown. We have shown that tumor
specific NXF1 adaptor proteins regulate export of oncogenic mRNAs. The adaptor
proteins are also highly upregulated during tumor initiation and knockdown of specific
adaptors inhibit tumorigenesis.
Objective/hypothesis: This proposal seeks to understand the molecular mechanisms
driving the progression from normal to neoplastic skin using a RAS driven human
epidermal tumor model. Our preliminary data suggests that 4 adaptor proteins are highly
upregulated during tumor initiation that associates with NXF1 to mediate the export of
the oncogenic gene expression program. Our objective is to characterize the role of
each tumor induced NXF1 adaptor protein in the progression of normal to neoplastic
skin. Furthermore we seek to determine the specific transcripts that each adaptor protein
binds during tumor initiation to promote tumorigenesis.
Specific Aims: (1) To determine the role of NXF1 adaptor proteins in the progression
from normal to neoplastic skin and (2) to identify the transcripts associated with NXF1
adaptor proteins and determine which bound transcripts are exported.
Study Design: To study epidermal tumorigenesis in a more clinically relevant setting,
we generate 3-dimensionally intact human skin, containing human epidermal cells (that
have been permanently knocked down for adaptor proteins) in the context of human
dermal stroma and basement membrane, regenerated on immune compromised mice.
By using this model, we can perform loss of function experiments on NXF1 adaptor
proteins in regenerated human skin to characterize their role in epidermal growth,
differentiation, and progression to neoplasia. We will use CLIP-Seq to determine the
RNAs associated with each adaptor protein during the progression from normal to
neoplastic epidermis."
10931634,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The pillars of multiple myeloma (MM) therapy are DNA alkylators (cyclophosphamide, melphalan), proteasome
inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, prednisone) and IMiDs
(thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide). Despite achieving an initial response, patients inevitably relapse
and MM remains incurable. More recently, remarkable responses have been obtained with immunotherapy:
antibodies against CD38 (daratumumab), bi-specific antibodies or BiTEs to BCMA, CAR-T cells against BCMA.
However, similarly to what observed with conventional therapy, none of these immune-oncology agents are
curative. We believe that in order to improve patient outcome we need to better define the changes induced by
the tumor on the surrounding immune cells and the effects that conventional and immunotherapy exert on the
tumor and its microenvironment. Unfortunately, most preclinical studies are conducted on xenograft models
lacking an immune system, or transiently reconstituted with human immune subsets and fail to capture the
complex interaction between tumor and immune cells.
Using the clinically predictive, fully immunocompetent Vk*MYChCRBN mouse model of MM we have generated,
we discovered that sensitivity to anti-BCMA bispecific antibody is affected by high tumor burden, which drives
excessive antigenic stimulation and T cell exhaustion. Combination therapies aimed to boost T cell function
increase the short-term activity of the bispecific antibody, but mice eventually relapse with modest improve in
overall survival. Surprisingly, the addition of cyclophosphamide proved very effective, by inducing a tempered
but durative T cell activation which was curative in a fraction of mice.
Based on our results in VkMYChCRBN MM we have designed a phase 1, randomized phase 2 clinical trial of a
BCMA/CD3 bispecific antibody teclistamab with the addition either iberdomide or cyclophosphamide. In this
proposal we aim to use the results of treating MM patients with either single agent teclistamab, or combinations
with iberdomide or cyclophosphamide to credential the Vk*MYChCRBN MM model for T-cell directed
immunotherapy. Finally, we will investigate factors that regulate the development of immunologic protection
and cure after bispecific antibody therapy. Overall, these data will further credential the Vk*MYChCRBN mouse
model of MM and inform the clinical development of bispecific antibodies in MM."

 Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) and is
the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the United States. The latest surveillance from the CDC reported that
Lyme disease affects more than ~475,000 people in the U.S. every year, a nearly 50% increase from 2015.
Furthermore, the disease is expanding from its endemic areas in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, and Upper
Midwest. The rapidly increasing public health risks and rising healthcare costs associated with the disease are
exacerbated by controversies surrounding its diagnosis and treatment. While the under-diagnosis of Lyme
disease has led to under-treatment, the mis-diagnosis and mis-treatment of the condition have led to serious
morbidity as well. Simply put, our current fundamental understanding of the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and
treatment of Lyme disease is lacking. Taken together, the data indicate that the development of tools for the
non-invasive molecular imaging of Lyme disease is an urgent scientific and clinical need.
 This R01 proposal is focused on the synthesis, characterization, and in vivo validation of first-in-class
radiopharmaceuticals for the PET imaging of Lyme disease. The target for these agents will be VlsE, a protein
that is abundantly expressed on the surface of Bbsl throughout its time in its vertebrate host. Specific Aim 1
(SA1) will be focused on the synthesis, chemical characterization, and in vitro biological evaluation of 89Zr-
labeled monoclonal antibodies and 68Ga-labeled single domain antibodies capable of binding VlsE with high
specificity, selectivity, and affinity. Specific Aim 2 (SA2) will be centered on interrogating the in vivo
performance of these VlsE-targeted radiopharmaceuticals in two murine models of Lyme disease. First, we will
use mice subcutaneously inoculated with cultured Bbsl to interrogate the sensitivity and specificity of the
radioimmunoconjugates and to assess the power of the imaging agents as tools for monitoring response to
antibiotic therapy. Subsequently, we will explore the performance of the VlsE-targeted PET probes in a more
advanced murine model of Lyme disease: mice infected multiple strains of Bbsl via Ixodes scapularis ticks. In
both models, longitudinal PET data will be used alongside a battery of ex vivo analytical techniques to evaluate
the ability of the radiotracers to delineate sites of active infection.
 Ultimately, we contend that a Bbsl-targeting radiotracer could have a paradigm-shifting impact on both the
basic science and clinical study of Lyme disease. In the laboratory, a VlsE-targeted radioimmunoconjugate
could be a valuable non-invasive tool for studying the dissemination, pathophysiology, and treatment of Bbsl
infections in murine models of disease. In the clinic, a Bbsl-targeted radiopharmaceutical could be an
indispensable research tool to support the clinical development of novel vaccines, therapeutics, and
diagnostics as well as an effective imaging agent to monitor the therapeutic response of patients with
particularly persistent or severe Bbsl infections."
10801811,"Abstract
Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality among women in low-and-middle-income
countries (LMICs) such as in Africa where screening by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) is the primary
strategy. Although in 2021 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended human papillomavirus (HPV)
testing as the preferred screening test in all settings, VIA will remain the most common screening test for the
foreseeable future in many LMICs, and the main triage test after the transition to HPV screening. However,
incomplete visualization of the transformation zone (TZ) of the cervix (Type 3 TZ) which accounts for about 15%
of women undergoing cervical cancer screening, is associated with missed lesions during VIA. Therefore,
interventions to increase complete visualization of the TZ (i.e., conversion), reducing Type 3 TZ at VIA, remain
a priority for cervical cancer prevention. Prostaglandin E1 (misoprostol), with cervical modulating effects, is a
promising intervention due to wide availability, low cost ($1/dose), single vaginal dose, benign side effects, and
small trials suggesting efficacy. However, misoprostol efficacy remains uncertain and it is unclear whether it will
vary by duration of misoprostol, age/menopause, parity or previous precancer treatment, or whether such a
program is acceptable, particularly in Africa, a region with the highest risk of cervical cancer. To address these
gaps, and building on our preliminary data, we propose a double-blind RCT (N=420) to evaluate the effectiveness
and acceptability of misoprostol to convert Type 3 TZ in patients attending a screening program in Cameroon.
The ultimate goal is to prevent cervical cancer and morbidity by improving detection of pre-/cancerous lesions.
Aim 1: Test the effectiveness of vaginal misoprostol 600 mcg vs. placebo to convert Type 3 TZ. Hypothesis 1:
In women with Type 3 TZ, misoprostol given up to 6hrs prior to VIA will increase the rate of conversion by over
50% (primary outcome) and detect more cervical pre-/cancer lesions (secondary outcome).
Sub Aim 1a: Identify optimal timing of misoprostol placement prior to same day evaluation to optimize efficacy
and other factors that influence the rate of conversion of Type 3 TZ. Hypothesis 1a: Cumulatively, conversion
rates at 4-6 hours after misoprostol will not be materially higher than at 2-3 hours and conversion rates will vary
by maternal age, parity, prior pre-cancer treatment and menopausal status.
Aim 2: Examine the acceptability and satisfaction of integrating misoprostol for Type 3 TZ into a cervical cancer
screening program in Africa from patient and health care worker perspectives. Hypothesis 2: Patients with Type
3 TZ and clinical providers will have high acceptability and satisfaction rates with this approach. Cameroon is a
low-resource setting with a high burden of cervical cancer and has a VIA-based comprehensive prevention
program which provides a framework for the proposed study. If successful, this simple inexpensive intervention
will reduce the risk of missed cervical lesions and improve early treatment and prevention cervical cancer."
10803887,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic inflammation of the brain occurs with aging and plays an important role in age-related cognitive decline
and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression. Proinflammatory chemokines not only bind to their cognate receptors,
but also to “atypical” chemokine receptors (ACKR) that lack intracellular signaling domains and principally serve
to buffer or control chemokine bioavailability. The Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) is a member
of the ACKR subfamily. DARC is highly expressed on red blood cells (RBCs), and to a lesser extent in other cell
types, where it functions as a chemokine ‘buffer-sink’, sequestering proinflammatory chemokines. There are two
dominant
DARC alleles in humans, Fyb
(predominant in European Caucasians)
and Fya
(hypofunctional allele
prevalent in Asians). A mutation in the promoter region of the Fyb allele abolishes the expression of DARC in
RBC. Notably, approximately 70% of African Americans harbor this mutation, which is associated with a pro-
inflammatory phenotype. We provide novel preliminary data showing that both global DARC knockout mice, and
mice lacking DARC selectively in blood cells, exhibit cognitive impairment and increased levels of
proinflammatory mediators associated with AD. Moreover, DARC is downregulated in the brain with aging and
in AD mice, and overexpression of mouse DARC in the brain alleviated cognitive impairment in 5xFAD mice,
supporting that DARC protects against AD-related cognitive decline. These novel findings lead us to hypothesize
that DARC plays an important role in regulating neuroinflammation, cognitive dysfunction and AD pathologies.
To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine if selective ablation of DARC
in blood cells accelerates age-related neuroinflammation and cognitive decline and exacerbates
neuropathological and cognitive phenotypes of AD mice. In Aim 2, we will determine if ablation or overexpression
of mouse DARC in forebrain glutamatergic neurons modulates neuronal vulnerability to degeneration, Aβ/tau
pathologies, and aging- and AD-associated cognitive impairment. In Aim 3, we will determine if DARC-Fya and
Fyb isoforms differ in their ability to sequester chemokines and Aβ and their protective effects against
neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment."
10803888,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In mammals, insulin primarily regulates metabolism while insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) stimulates growth,
proliferation and differentiation. Aberrant production of IGF-1 is connected with different human diseases
including growth disorders such as Laron syndrome, acromegaly and Graves' orbitopathy as well as thyroid
eye disease (TED) and the early stages of diabetic nephropathy. In addition, circulating levels of IGF-1 are
increased in cancer patients and IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) expression is upregulated in various tumor types.
Although the IGF1R system plays a key role in tumor progression and has been one of the most intensively
investigated molecular targets in cancer research, previous clinical attempts to develop IGF1R inhibitors have
largely failed. Thus, there is a critical knowledge gap regarding the underlying mechanisms of IGF1R inhibition
and an urgent need to develop novel IGF1R inhibitors. The data generated through my K01 grant has
expanded the family of insulin/IGF-like hormones and provided us a new tool to probe this complex system:
viral insulin/IGF-1-like peptides (VILPs). Previously, we chemically synthesized these VILPs and characterized
their function on the insulin receptor (IR)/IGF1R system using in vitro and in vivo assays. While most of the
VILPs are natural agonists of the IR and IGF1R, we showed that two VILPs in Mandarin fish ranavirus (MFRV)
and Lymphocystis disease virus-1 (LCDV1) are highly specific and potent antagonists of the IGF1R. This
discovery has opened up new avenues for understanding and studying IGF1R inhibition. The overarching goal
of this proposal is to examine unique antagonist effects of MFRV and LCDV VILPs on the IGF1R to elucidate
the underlying structural and molecular mechanisms of the IGF1R inhibition. Our central hypothesis is that the
VILPs will inhibit IGF1R signaling and IGF-1 related proliferation function via their unique interaction with the
IGF1R, differentially regulating post-receptor signaling pathways and IGF1R gene expression. We will test this
hypothesis based on two independent Aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that VILPs engage with
human IGF1R in a unique way, recruit different substrates to the receptor and modify post-receptor signaling
while directly regulating IGF1R gene expression. We expect to determine the molecular and structural
mechanisms of the hIGF1R antagonism in vitro. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that VILPs will specifically
inhibit IGF1R signaling in vivo without affecting IR signaling and decrease IGF-1 mediated growth without
affecting glucose metabolism. These findings will define the effects of VILP-mediated IGF1R inhibition using
two in vivo models of IGF-1 mediated growth and IGF-1 mediated tumor progression. This proposal is built on
the conceptual innovation based on our exciting discovery of the VILPs and their unique effects on IGF1R. We
propose using cutting-edge techniques and if proven right, these studies will transform our understanding of
the IGF1R inhibition and function as a proof-of-principle for the introduction of peptide-based inhibitors of the
IGF1R into the framework of human disease research."
10802720,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD), both autosomal dominant (AD) and autosomal recessive (AR) forms, remains
the leading cause of inheritable kidney disease in adults and children throughout the US as well as worldwide.
Though the pathogenesis of renal cyst formation is understood to be driven primarily by a loss-of-function
mutation in the polycystin in ADPKD and fibrocystin gene in ARPKD, there remains no cure for these diseases
beyond kidney transplantation. Vasopressin (AVP) signaling blockade has been demonstrated to blunt cyst
formation, specifically through pharmacological targeting of AVP receptor type 2 (V2R) with Tolvaptan. While
V2R antagonism may benefit the patient by delaying cyst and renal disease progression, chronic V2R blockade
often leads to a decrease in quality of life due to symptoms such as polydipsia and polyuria. An understudied
contributor to hypothalamic regulation of AVP is from the kidney itself, through the renal afferent nerves. With
the emergence of catheter-based renal denervation to treat cardiovascular disease, alternative applications of
this technique may benefit patient populations with potential aberrant renal nerve signaling. We have recently
reported that afferent renal nerve activity (ARNA) is increased over two-fold in an ARPKD model compared to
non-cystic controls, and total renal denervation (TRDNx), which disrupts both renal afferent and sympathetic
nerve activity, mitigates the cystogenesis and lowers arterial pressure. In addition, targeted ablation of only renal
sensory (i.e. afferent) nerves (ARDNx) had a similar abrogating effect on cystogenesis, which highlights the
intriguing and novel role of renal nerves in the pathogenesis of this this model. While these data are promising,
the mechanisms mediating these responses remain unclear and require further investigation. Critically, we aim
to elucidate the role and mechanisms by which renal nerves contribute to AR- and ADPKD. The following aims
form the experimental basis of this research proposal: (1) Determine the role of renal nerves in the progression
of renal cystogenesis and neurohumoral axis in ARPKD. We will perform either complete bilateral or unilateral
renal denervations in PCK rats to test the hypothesis that renal nerves contribute to all phases of renal
cystogenesis, function, and proliferative signaling in both the early, mid, and late phases of ARPKD. (2) Elucidate
the molecular mechanism and consequences of elevated afferent renal nerve activity in ARPKD. We will quantify
the excitatory effects of renal inflammatory cytokines to isolate the causes for elevated afferent renal nerve
activity in the PCK rat. We will pair these studies with histochemical tracings of neural activation following renal
inflammatory stimuli. (3) Investigate the role for renal nerves and interaction with Tolvaptan in ADPKD
progression. We will determine the role for renal innervation and interaction with V2R antagonist Tolvaptan (FDA-
approved) in the cystogenesis and renal dysfunction in mouse models of rapid (PKD1-/-) and progressive onset
(PKD1rc/rc) of ADPKD. These studies are poised to bring a robust and innovative experimental approach to
dissecting the novel role of renal nerves in PKD pathogenesis, potentially identifying a novel therapeutic modality."
10804057,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal fibrotic lung disease. IPF is
characterized by fibroblast and myofibroblast foci and excessive accumulation of
extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. IPF is prevalent among the Veteran population.
Myofibroblast differentiation is thought as one of the responsible mechanisms for
excessive ECM protein production and accumulation, leading to progressive fibrotic
lesions in lung. It is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that are
responsible for myofibroblast activation in IPF. Tristetraprolin (TTP) is a major regulator of
gene expression and modulates mRNA stability. The preliminary data demonstrate that
TTP function is impaired in IPF. We speculate that impaired TTP function likely results in
a dysregulated regulation system of gene expression, and consequently leads to
pathological conditions. This proposal aims to investigate the role of TTP as a break to
limit fibrotic response and lung fibrosis. It is important to understand the molecular
mechanism leading to increased pro-fibrotic response in IPF. The preliminary data
demonstrate that TTP regulates ECM protein expression and signaling that are important
for myofibroblast differentiation and functions, and gain of TTP decreases ECM protein
expression and signaling, and myofibroblast differentiation in IPF lung fibroblasts. We
hypothesize that impaired TTP fosters a ‘pro-fibrotic ECM niche’, fueling cell-matrix
interaction and signaling that increases myofibroblast differentiation and fibrotic
responses. This proposal aims to define the role of TTP in myofibroblast differentiation
and lung fibrosis, examine the molecular mechanism involved, determine the impact of
impaired TTP function on ECM production and accumulation, and the role of TTP in
fibrogenesis and fibrotic remodeling in vivo. Completion of this project will provide new
insight about the mechanisms responsible for the development of pulmonary fibrosis and
serve the goal to develop more effective therapy for IPF patients."
10795412,"Project Summary/Abstract
 In the decades after the American Revolution, citizens imposed significant restrictions on
physically and intellectually disabled people’s legal, political, and social rights. Increasingly towards the
mid-nineteenth century, these restrictions were justified with medical theories and managed and
implemented by physicians. As a result, disabled people—men and women, black and white, wealthy and
poor, from across the nation—lost access to basic civil rights and privileges, including suffrage, marriage,
property ownership, and independent living. At the same time, this project documents how disabled
people challenged the exclusions they faced, claiming knowledge of the functioning of their bodies and
minds as they fought for greater access and opportunity. Just as ableism has a long American history so
too does disability rights activism as individuals used legal, political, institutional, and physical means to
claim their status as equal citizens.
 This narrative of ableist exclusion, medical justification, and disability rights resistance has long
been overlooked in accounts of our nation’s history. Scholars in the fields of early American history and
the history of medicine have been slow to attend to disability and integrate findings from the discipline of
disability studies into their work. Scholars in disability studies, meanwhile, have tended to focus on more
recent historical periods. Academic oversight of early American disability history has also shaped popular
national narratives. Museums, historical societies, and the media all rarely feature disabled people when
they chronicle our nation’s founding period. Drawing on nearly a decade of primary source research in
legal, medical, governmental, institutional, and genealogical records, this project centers disabled people
to tell a more accurate and inclusive national story—crucial as our country nears its semiquincentennial
anniversary in 2026.
 With publication (the manuscript is committed to a top academic press), this project seeks to
accomplish three aims. First, it documents the structural ableism that defined our nation’s founding
period. Second, it reveals how physicians rationalized ableist exclusions and implemented them in legal,
political, institutional, and social settings. Third, the work chronicles the resilient individuals who
challenged these restrictions as they worked to improve their lives, families, and communities. This
history is crucial for a full and accurate understanding of our early American past as well as critical
context as we confront and challenge ableism today."
10932977,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There has been a dramatic increase in the number of persons living with reduced physical function and with
aging-related chronic conditions. If we compare chronological age (calendar-based age) with biological age
(changes at the cellular, tissue, organ, and system levels), we can classify persons as aging faster
(accelerated aging) or slower (successful aging) than their peers. Methods have been developed to measure
biological age based on DNA methylation, telomere length, and blood biomarkers. However, such measures
may not accurately reflect organ- and tissue-level changes from aging. A multi-organ/tissue approach is
needed to identify comprehensive age-related structural changes before signs, symptoms, or clinical
diagnoses occur. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) has widespread use in the general population (35%
of adults ages 20-89 years in an 11-year period). Quantitative measures of the organs and tissues on
abdominal CT may predict organ-specific diseases, or in combination, may be used to calculate biological age
and predict the more global outcomes of hospitalization and mortality. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that
deep learning (DL) models applied to abdominal CTs can quantify structural features of the organs and tissues
to identify persons with accelerated aging at high-risk for organ-specific disease, hospitalization, and death.
The Rochester Epidemiology Project record-linkage system provides access to a general population archive of
images for 423,081 abdominal CTs and to comprehensive medical record data among 181,187 adults (ages
20-89 years) between 2010-2020. Our team has already developed and validated DL tools to measure liver,
kidney, aorta, fat, muscle, and bone on abdominal CT images. We will leverage these resources to 1) establish
percentiles of abdominal CT biomarkers from both healthy and general population samples; 2) determine the
risk of organ-specific clinical disease by abdominal CT biomarkers in the general population; and 3) determine
the risk of hospitalization and death associated with abdominal CT measures in the general population. If
successful, application of DL tools to abdominal CT images will enrich the characterization of age-related
health risks without additional testing burden. Subclinical abdominal CT biomarkers may also inform the
biology of aging and early disease, improve disease classification, and provide opportunities for early
intervention."

This project will enhance our understanding of the humoral immune response to Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) and
its polysaccharide antigens with the long-term goal of guiding and optimizing broad vaccine development. Kp
infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and bacteremia, are sharply on the rise among
hospitalized patients; CDC has declared infections with Kp and other carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriales
(CRE) demand a threat level of urgent. Beyond classical Kp typically seen in the US, emerging hypervirulent Kp
strains, capable of causing liver abscess, bacteremia, and meningitis in healthy hosts, are spreading globally.
This work builds on the PI's background in bacteriology, Gram-negative bacterial pathogenesis, and modeling
of host adaptive immune responses, to investigate antibodies targeting Kp's polysaccharide capsule (K-type)
and O-antigen. We have found that, while mice are able to produce antibodies targeting Kp capsule and O-
antigen, capsule may directly interfere with O-antibody binding and killing of Kp. With our collaborators at
Omniose, we have developed and are testing novel bioconjugate vaccines targeting the most prevalent K- and
O-types. Bioconjugation is an alternative manufacturing process that uses recombinant E. coli strains to
concurrently produce the capsule or O-antigen and an engineered carrier protein, and to enzymatically link the
two. We have produced multiple K- and O-bioconjugates that have demonstrated promising efficacy in mice.
As both O- and K- vaccines are under development, we will use our novel bioconjugate vaccines in murine
protection experiments to determine the relative effectiveness of O-antigen or K-antigen bioconjugates against
classical and hypervirulent Kp isolates. Further, we will challenge O-immunized mice with strains of closely
related O-antigen structural subtypes that have not been included to date in vaccine formulations being
developed commercially. Potential masking of O-antigen by capsule will be determined through mouse serum
IgG ELISAs. Serum bactericidal assays (SBAs) and opsonophagocytic killing assays (OPKAs) will be developed
and correlated with murine protection. Further, with bacterial mutants, complemented strains, and capsule
inhibitors, we will determine the specificity of Kp O-antibody inhibition by capsule, utilizing multiple techniques
including biolayer interferometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, and transmission immunoelectron
microscopy. Finally, we will perform a first-ever longitudinal study of human patients with Kp infection, analyzing
their sera for antibodies specific to Kp polysaccharides and their functional activity against the inciting Kp strain.
At the conclusion of these studies, the relative efficacy of both K- and O-type bioconjugate vaccines will be
determined, cross-protection among O-antigen subtypes will be resolved, correlates of protective immunity will
be established, and mechanisms of O-antigen masking will be defined. Our results will illuminate human antibody
responses to Kp infection and guide vaccine development to target this worrisome pathogen."
10795230,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Cell therapy is an innovative and non-toxic regenerative approach for the treatment of inflammatory and
degenerative disorders. Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cells (MSCs) are widely being tested as cellular and
regenerative therapy and in some countries, it is already approved as standard clinical care for the management
of inflammatory bowel disease associated complications. Specifically, Perianal fistula (PF) is a serious
complication of Crohn’s Disease (CD) which substantially affects the quality of life of those patients. Treatment
options are limited and are not highly effective. MSCs derived from adipose tissue has been approved in Europe
for the treatment of complex PF in patients with CD. Although this stem cell therapy is showing efficacy, side
effects such as anal abscess, proctalgia, and variations in treatment responses are common which could be due
to the allogeneic nature of this cell therapy. The current unmet is the development of an autologous cell therapy
strategy with enhanced potency and safety for the treatment of PF. We hypothesize that MSCs derived from the
rectum of patients with CD display robust immunosuppressive and regenerative properties that can be used as
an autologous cellular therapy. We also hypothesize that rectum derived MSCs’ potency can be further improved
with appropriate inflammatory cue mediated preactivation, and thus they can function amidst confounding
factors. In the present preclinical research phase, we aim to characterize the potency of rectum derived MSCs
from patients with CD. Mercer University School of Medicine’s mission is to educate students to become future
physicians and serve rural and underserved regions of Georgia. Involvement of students in this Research
Enhancement Award Program will bring exposure and help them to apply cellular therapy in rural health care.
The results of this study can inform a second-generation cell therapy approach not only for the management of
PF but also for bowel inflammation."

given the myriad intersecting challenges they face due to identity stigma and caregiver burden. This project
further seeks to co-design and test a culturally relevant intervention to meet these unique needs. Drawing on
strong mentor support, additional research training, and logistical assistance from professional organizations,
the candidate will gain necessary capacity to ensure successful completion of aims."
10806990,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produce all blood lineages and replenish blood in response to loss or injury
throughout life. HSCs like most adult stem cells, are mainly quiescent. Quiescence is proposed to protect
HSCs from replicative and metabolic stress that would otherwise impact health and longevity, thereby
enabling them to maintain tissue homeostasis and allowing for the repair of defective/damaged tissue during
their lifetime. Progress in HSC-based therapies is partly hindered by lack of reliable approaches to modulate
HSC quiescence and activity. Thus, understanding the core molecular mechanisms of HSC quiescence is
fundamental for improving HSC health and longevity and has major translational implications for the clinic.
By applying a new approach based on mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), we identified the most
dormant subsets of both human and mouse HSCs. Using this approach, we recently discovered that
lysosomal activity is pivotal for the maintenance of mouse HSC quiescence. Our findings suggest that
lysosomes dynamically regulate the hematopoietic stem cell switch between quiescent and active states.
Here, we propose to investigate lysosomal function and the effects of modulation of lysosomal activity on the
potency of human HSCs. These studies are likely to provide means towards extending the availability of
human HSCs. Overall, translation of our findings to human HSCs will build the foundation towards advancing
cell therapy."
10805601,"Veterans’ rates of sleep disorders have been increasing over the past 20 years, and millions report shorter than
recommended sleep durations for optimal sleep health. Contemporaneously, ongoing cannabis legislation in the
U.S. has increased access to, and availability of, cannabis products distinct by mode, formulation, and
cannabinoid composition. Moreover, as cannabis’ perceptions of harm are declining, widespread beliefs about
its therapeutic benefits are increasing and cannabis use disorder (CUD) remains prevalent. For example, one of
the most common reasons Veterans use cannabis is for sleep. However, cannabis’s effect on sleep is unclear,
likely due to a reliance on self-reports, cross-sectional data, and insufficient attention to cannabis product type.
Laboratory studies also administer cannabis with limited cannabinoid profiles and lower potency compared to
commercially available products used for sleep in the real-world. Equally important, cannabis/sleep research has
not adequately prioritized Veterans as prior findings come almost exclusively from civilian populations.
Smartphone apps and wearable technologies are valuable and unobtrusive tools to generate fine-grained data
on substance use and health behaviors. These technology-based-tools (TBTs) have considerable promise to
help understand how cannabis and sleep are related and identify potential prevention and intervention targets
tailored to Veterans. As such, the primary research objective of this Career Development Award-2 (CDA-2) is
to prospectively examine bi-directional relations between cannabis and sleep among non-CUD-treatment
seeking Veterans in the natural environment. Participants will first complete a 30-day pilot study by wearing a
Fitbit device and using an EMA app on their smartphone to measure cannabis use and sleep in the field followed
by individual interviews to determine protocol feasibility, acceptability, and adherence (Phase I, Aim 1). After
refining the study procedures based on results from the prior phase, Phase II research will evaluate bi-directional
links between cannabis use and sleep physiology/behaviors during a 30-day observational field period (Aim 2.1),
explore participants’ lived experiences using cannabis for sleep (Aim 2.2), and determine which specific cannabis
modes, formulations, or cannabinoid compositions are most harmful (or helpful) to self-reported and technology-
derived sleep behaviors (Aim 2.3).
Dr. Berey has demonstrated considerable scholarly productivity with an established track record of using different
TBTs in substance use research. This CDA-2 proposal aims to accelerate Dr. Berey’s training in cannabis and
sleep using TBTs, and to launch his VA-based research program. A collaborative and coordinated mentor team
will facilitate his successful transition to independence via training in: 1) EMA and wearable technologies (Drs.
McGeary and Merrill), 2) cannabis use among Veterans (Dr. Metrik), 3) measurement and core components of
sleep (Dr. Carskadon), and 4) advanced analytic techniques for longitudinal data (Dr. Merrill). This award offers
protected time that will allow Dr. Berey to engage in diverse training activities to strengthen his mixed-methods
research skills that he will use to identify optimal prevention and intervention targets for Veterans with sleep
problems and who use cannabis. Dr. Berey’s mentorship team consists of VA clinician scientists and non-VA
researchers with considerable expertise in areas germane to this CDA-2 proposal. The proposed mentors are
ideal candidates to facilitate Dr. Berey’s career goal of becoming an independent, VA-based scientist whose
research will have high public health impact by helping to improve Veterans’ clinical outcomes. Findings from
the CDA-2 will address a critically important gap in our understanding of how cannabis and sleep are related and
provide foundational data for subsequent VA Merit proposals."

The integrated approach described in the UNM Center for Native Environmental Health Equity (Native EH
Equity) will for the first time address, across multiple tribes, disparities in social determinants of health, and
tribal cultural and traditional practices with the potential to provide resilience to reduce the effects of
environmental disparities on the health of Native Americans. The Native EH Equity approach, also for the
first time, provides an integrative understanding of the generalizability of risk and resilience factors across
multiple tribes – Navajo Nation, Crow Nation, and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe (CRST) - to improve both
our understanding of these relationships, and our ability to develop and prioritize evidence-based risk
reduction and prevention strategies. The focus of Native EH Equity will be to develop common data sets
that for the first time will standardize our approach to assessing these variables across multiple tribes.
Achieving these goals requires a strong administrative structure to ensure consistency across all
components of the Center, to ensure parallel data are collected from each of the partner tribes, and that
data are managed in a structure that ensures integration and allows comparative analyses. The
Administrative Core (AC) for Native EH Equity brings decades of experience working with Tribal
communities, leadership, and agencies; of managing and analyzing large and complex datasets; of
oversight of career development programs; of integrative analyses allowing replication of findings with
multiple levels of data; and of successful translation of results to enhance understanding in communities,
among researchers, to federal agencies, and to health care providers. The goal of the Administrative Core
(AC) is to facilitate responsible management, resource allocation, integration and communication within the
team; to foster successful career development for new investigators; to provide and manage pilot funding;
and long-term to develop sustainable partnerships integrated within the institutional and tribal structures to
ensure sustainability of research on Native Environmental Health Equity."

and an ongoing webinar series covering such topics as incorporating traditional ecologic knowledge (TEK) into
the research process; environmental, biological and social determinants of health; collection and quality control
of environmental and survey data. The CEDC will seek collaboration from the community to 1) refine strategies
to support environmental sampling (e.g. identifying locations and frequency of trash burning activities for
monitoring micro-plastics and chemical exposures in environmental media), and participant recruitment for
surveys, 2) identify and support research liaisons, and 3) identify and support promising pilot project topics and
community collaborators. In response to community concerns, and lack of data, a survey of social stressors
and resilience factors is included as a CEDC activity in all tribal communities. Also in response to community
needs, implementation of a targeted environmental health and toxicology literacy education program will be
continued in the CEDC. Community research liaisons, hired exclusively from tribal communities, will
understand of environmental exposure sources and pathways based on local TEK, and transgenerational
perspectives on health and resiliency. The liaisons will assist with collection of environmental samples
including placement and collection of stationary wristbands and plant samples as citizen scientists. They will
conduct outreach, collect survey data and support research dissemination. Traditional Ecological Knowledge
(TEK)/Indigenous Way of Knowing (IWK) influence decisions regarding participation in research, especially
projects that involve the collection of information that has implications for others in the community. To facilitate
the linkage with TEK/IWK, our artist-in-residence will continue to develop art pieces (e.g. paintings) to translate
the Center’s complex scientific research objectives and findings to tribal communities using traditional
messaging relayed through native symbolism, storytelling, and other transgenerational imagery."
10808159,"SUMMARY- INVESTIGATOR DEVELOPMENT CORE
The Pilot Program will emphasize high quality research that promotes collaboration between the Center and
the partner communities, and promotes development of new investigators as they strive to establish
independent research programs in Native environmental health disparities research. The Pilot Program will
align with the Center’s mission and theme by providing sub-awards to partner organizations in support of
innovative research ideas of importance to environmental health disparities. The overarching objective of the
Pilot Program is to encourage active participation of Center partners to develop a sustained, powerful
influence on reducing health disparities by promoting quality research and building long-term research
capacity. We will work with community partners to identify research questions and develop research
approaches to address gaps in knowledge related to the impacts of environmental health disparities within
our partner communities. We will identify specific research questions of concern related to exposure from
burning trash, microplastics, or environmental metals. Center researchers will work directly with community
members and research partners to construct hypothesis driven research proposals that directly address
community concerns and that fit within the scope and capabilities of the Center. We will work to promote
research opportunities for young investigators and members of health disparity populations through
recruitment, mentoring, research training and professional development opportunities. We will leverage off
existing programs and Centers, take advantage of strong institutional resources and support, and build on
our existing success to recruit promising young investigators from members of health disparity populations to
our Center. We will provide mentoring support, research training and professional opportunities that will
promote successful completion of projects and promote long-term research capacity."
10808162,"Project Summary “Role of Open Dumping And Open Burning Of Solid Waste In The Generation Of
Microplastics And Products Of Incomplete Combustion On Tribal Lands”
This research project addresses two critical issues in tribal lands caused by open dumping and burning: 1)
potential generation of secondary microplastics which are currently under intense investigation worldwide due
to their unknown health and environmental effects and 2) generation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
which include a wide array of potential toxic substances. Open dumping and burning practices are common in
tribal lands posing potential health to communities located nearby. Open dumping enables plague propagation,
infection transmission, wildfire fire generation, greenhouse gas emission, water and solid ecosystems pollution,
and bad odor emissions among other undesired effects. Open burning in addition to producing typical
combustion products (e.g., carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water vapor, hydrogen sulfide) generates
products of incomplete combustion. Products of incomplete combustion include greenhouse gases, reactive
trace gases, VOCs, semi-VOCs, dioxins, and other toxic compounds, ashes, and particulate matter. Secondary
microplastics are a potential product of incomplete combustion. Secondary microplastics are plastic materials
generated by the fragmentation of larger plastic pieces. Despite the disparities in infrastructure that increase
the likelihood of microplastics generation on tribal lands, their occurrence due to open burning practices and
their effect on environment and health in tribal lands is largely unknown. We hypothesize that open dumping
and burning practices generate and propagate microplastics and toxic VOCs in air, water, and soil enabling the
exposure of communities located in proximity to waste disposal sites. The goal of the proposed project is to
better understand the disparate environmental and health impacts of dumping and burning in tribal
communities. We will partner with communities in Crow, Navajo, and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe for this
investigation. We propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Identify changes in physical and
chemical properties of plastics from open burning activities and propagation pathways through the environment
in lab scale experiments and field Specific Aim 2: Identify the potential exposure pathways and the
environmental biophysical impacts of plastics from open burning activities in soil-plant-air systems. Specific
Aim 3: Identify patterns in release of VOC, PAH, and dioxins released from open burning activities. Each tribal
community likely has unique burning practices, thus the identification of both common and distinct patterns will
help inform mitigation strategies that can be applied broadly or can be specifically tailored by community."
10808165,"Project Summary
Communities that practice traditional land-based cultures are intimately connected to the environment due to
cultural, spiritual, and traditional practices. While our Center’s previous work demonstrated varying degrees of
metal exposure among members of Navajo Nation, Cheyenne River Sioux (CRST) and Apsaálooke (Crow),
single exposure pathway (e.g. water) investigations were not sufficient to explain individual-level exposure and
adverse health outcomes. Moreover, there remains limited knowledge on other chemical exposure sources
prominent on Tribal lands, such as trash burning, that may lead to accumulation of microplastics, volatile, and
semi-volatile compounds in the environment and lead human exposures. This research project will address the
challenge of integrating multiple exposure routes for Native communities through modeling combined
environmental exposure potential. We will adapt an existing GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis
approach that can integrate air, water, and soil pathways previously used by our group. Our modeling
framework enables integration of novel soil, water, air, and plant data on microplastics and other chemicals
produced by low-temperature trashing combustion. This research approach is innovative because it
investigates combined exposures on tribal lands, including microplastics and combusted plastic by-products
against a background of high metal exposures. We will (1) develop predictive and validate combined
environmental exposure models based on GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis, which considers chemical
sources, topography, infrastructure, and land-use practices; (2) ground truth model predictions through
measurement of combined exposures for people and cultural resources (such as livestock and plants) using
silicone wristbands, human biomonitoring, and immunology studies; and (3) collect community-scale health
survey data to begin assessing exposure :disease relationships (e.g., cancer, autoimmunity, and
cardiovascular disease) in collaboration with RP3. SA1 will generate the first combined environmental
exposure spatial products for Apsaálooke (Crow) and Crow and CRST reservation lands and a refined product
for NN. These spatial products will support environmental health research among Tribal communities and
provide policy-makers with critical information to address Tribal health disparities. The studies proposed in SA2
provide important ground truthing of the GIS-based model through individual-level chemical and immune
marker measurements. This will inform policy makers about the scope and extent of combined environmental
exposures in their communities and allow us to consider the contributions of combined chemical exposures to
associations with metals that we have observed in participant samples from these communities. The health
survey data will provide data to validate and substantiate health disparities at individual community scale for
tribal community partners, and at a scale consistent with the combined exposure prediction scale in our model."
10808167,"Summary
RP3 Hierarchical statistical modeling and causal inference approaches to elucidate exposure
pathways underlying health disparities
The health disparity between the Native American population and the US general population arises from the
complex interplay between multiple socio-demographic, behavior, lifestyle and genetic susceptibility factors.
Environmental contaminants are increasingly acknowledged to play an important part in explaining health
disparity through their combined or interaction effects with other factors. Proximities of Native American
communities to abandoned uranium mines (AUM) have been of particular health concern. These chronic
exposures to AUM waste related metal mixtures pose higher risk for developing chronic and fatal diseases
including hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, and types of cancer in Native American populations
compared to the US population. The hypothesis of this project is that the three Native American tribal
communities included in this study (Navajo Nation, Crow, and Cheyenne River Sioux) encounter great risk of
exposures to environmental hazards (mine waste related metal mixture exposures, unregulated water
resources, and illegal dumping, etc.). These hazardous exposures along with socioeconomic status,
psychosocial stress, behavior/lifestyle factors influence multiple biological pathways to produce health
disparities in Native American communities. The complex set of exposure variables including dietary nutrients,
physical activity, infectious agents, air pollutants and metal exposures at both the individual and community
levels are acknowledged as contributors to health disparities, however, their relative contributions of the
potential causal factors have not been well studied. The objective of this project is to employ data-driven and
modeling approaches to understand the relative contribution of different environmental, behavior, and
socioeconomic determinants of the health disparities between the native population and the US national
population. We will use innovative modeling approaches such as decomposition analyses and structural
causal models to estimate the effects of risk factors at the individual and community level on the health
disparities. In Aim 1, we will collect data and summarize the frequency distributions for major chronic and fatal
diseases in the Native American communities. In Aim 2, we will employ novel hierarchical modeling
approaches to estimate the relative contribution of different risk factors at the individual level and community
level to the health disparities. In Aim 3, we will implement frontier causal pathway analyses to illustrate the
intermediate mechanisms explaining the health disparity. Aim 4 is to examine the complex correlation structure
among multi-dimensional exposures, intermediate biological responses, and health endpoints using frontier
statistical approaches. We expect this project will identify major contributing factors that explain a large
proportion of the health disparity, and in addition elucidate the intermediate causal pathway that the effects are
transmitted to the health disparity endpoints. These findings have the potential to inform policymaking on the
cost-effective resource allocation to maximally reduce disparity and improve community health."
10810669,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The caregiving environment children experience is the most important modifiable feature for shaping brain
development and influencing subsequent mental health. Building from knowledge of infant mental health and
developmental neuroscience, this NIMH BRAINS award application is designed to advance our understanding
of how children’s experiences with their caregivers during infancy, a developmental period characterized by
heightened brain plasticity, influences brain and behavioral development. Specifically, we will use innovative
methods to characterize multiple aspects of the early caregiving environment in relation to changes in brain
structural and functional connectivity that are believed to contribute to the onset of mental disorders. The
application of new tools, coupled with traditional metrics, will improve our measurement of children’s
experiences using a child-centered approach (i.e., capturing children’s contact with multiple caregivers). To do
this, we will recruit 150 women in pregnancy and, following birth, conduct assessments in children’s daily
ecological context at ages 1, 6, 12, and 18 months. This project introduces a wearable device technology that
can dynamically, unobtrusively, and continuously measure patterns of physical proximity between children and
caregivers, regardless of physical location. In addition to children’s proximity to caregivers, we will obtain
ecological assessments of language exposure and observation-based caregiver sensitivity and examine the
convergence and divergence among these different ways of capturing children’s experiences (Specific Aim 1).
While prior research suggests that greater environmental enrichment leads to lower symptoms of
psychopathology, the lack of granularity in measurement (i.e., not capturing the full continuum of relative
psychosocial neglect–enrichment) has precluded the ability to characterize the shape of these associations
(e.g., linear, nonlinear). We will study children selected to range in experiences along the neglect–enrichment
continuum and use repeated neuroimaging of infant brain structural and functional connectivity and repeated
behavioral assessments to explore the possible profile of the associations between aspects of the caregiving
environment and changes in brain and behavior (Specific Aim 2). Last, we will examine how changes in
emotion regulation and emotion reasoning circuitry are associated with signs of emerging psychopathology at
age 18 months in order to test whether, when, and how variations in early experience influence risk for
psychopathology through changes in emotion-related circuitry (Specific Aim 3). Here, neuroimaging is
particularly advantageous as it allows us to examine the maturation of emotion-related networks from birth and,
importantly, prior to the onset of detectable mental health difficulties. Achievement of the aims of this proposal
is expected to meet NIMH’s objectives to determine the biological and psychological mechanisms by which
experience affects neural and behavioral development, with direct applications for prevention and early
intervention."
10810676,"Project Summary
Our proposal focuses on the epigenetic mechanisms of microglia-mediated regulation of brain homeostasis
and neuro-degeneration. Our recent studies revealed brain region-specific microglia specification and
suggested that this specification matches distinct neuron phenotypes in functionally distinct brain areas. We
showed that regional microglia specification depends on the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2),
which silences microglia genes in a brain-region specific fashion. Ablation of PRC2 “relaxes” specification
of microglia followed by neurodegenerative-like changes in neuronal function and behavior. These findings
suggest a model where interaction between “matching” neurons and microglia renders microglia from the
aberrant production of factors responsible for microglial-mediated neuronal damage. To test our hypothesis,
we propose to identify PRC2 targets in microglia in different brain regions and to determine the impact of
PRC2 inactivation on regional microglia specification. PRC2 has been shown to operate downstream of
different signaling pathways including the RAF/Erk signaling pathway, which has been implicated in
microglia-mediated neurotoxicity. We hypothesize that activation of these signaling pathways may trigger
the aberrant expression of genes controlling microglia proliferation, phagocytosis and/or proinflammatory
activity by directly affecting PRC2 function. We will address the link between signal-induced microglia-driven
neurotoxicity and PRC2-mediated gene silencing.
Much of the microglia-mediated toxicity during neurodegeneration involves the activation of inflammatory
responses. Our proposal aims at identification of the gene regulatory mechanisms supporting the
proinflammatory activity of microglia. We found that BET proteins, which link histone acetylation and
activation of RNA Pol II, play a key role in the signal-induced transcription of proinflammatory genes in
microglia. We show that the pharmacological inhibition of BET leads to the selective suppression of microglia
inflammatory gene expression in vitro and in vivo. The BET family includes the structurally different BRD2,
BRD3 and BRD4 proteins, all of which are expressed in microglia. We previously observed differential
binding of individual BET proteins to distinct gene targets in macrophages and neurons. Using mice with
conditional microglia-specific inactivation, we will determine the contribution of individual BET proteins to
brain region-specific microglia phenotypes in the healthy brain and during neurodegeneration. In summary,
the proposed research will identify novel epigenetic mechanisms of region-specific microglia specification
and the contribution of these mechanisms to neurodegeneration. Identification of proteins controlling distinct
states of microglia activity will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention
and/or attenuation of neurodegeneration."
10810682,"Project Summary:
 Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) maintains an epigenetic memory of cell identity and controls
many fundamental cellular processes, such as stem cell pluripotency maintenance, stem cell differentiation, X-
chromosome inactivation, imprinting, and so on. Dysregulation of PRC2 function is associated with a wide
spectrum of cancers and developmental disorders. On the molecular level, PRC2 mediates histone H3 lysine
27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), hallmark of gene silencing. Cell type and developmental state-specific PRC2
function largely depends on the dynamic interactome of the complex. PRC2 displays tremendous
compositional complexity, which correlates with pleiotropic roles of PRC2 in cell development. The core PRC2
complex consists of EZH1/2, EED, SUZ12 and RBBP4/7. The mammalian paralogs EZH1 and EZH2 are the
catalytic subunit of PRC2. The enzymatic activity and chromatin targeting of PRC2 are impacted by a diverse
array of accessory subunits, including AEBP2, JARID2, PHF1, MTF2, PHF19 and EPOP, which form two
classes of mutually exclusive PRC2 holo complexes. Besides these mostly dedicated accessory subunits,
PRC2 also dynamically associates with a plethora of other cellular factors to mediate crosstalk with important
cell signaling pathways, for example BRCA1 in DNA damage response and repair, DNMTs in DNA methylation
and genomic imprinting, and CTCF in genome structure and organization.
 While biologically and clinically important PRC2 function has been widely appreciated, the underlying
molecular mechanisms are largely lacking. Due to their size and complexity, biochemical reconstitution and
structural analysis of the molecular assemblies of PRC2 present a formidable challenge; only recently have we
and others started to reveal the structural basis of catalysis, chromatin binding and disease mutation of PRC2.
The overarching theme of this MIRA award is focused on the structure and function of PRC2 and aims to
understand how they are regulated to control cell proliferation and differentiation. The proposed study will
close gaps of understanding in the field by addressing the following three specific questions. (1) How the
enzymatic activity of PRC2 is regulated in various cellular contexts? (2) How is PRC2 specifically recruited to
CpG island chromatin? (3) How are the structural mechanisms of PRC2 connected to gene regulation during
some central biological processes, such as stem cell differentiation and epigenetic memory maintenance
during cell division?"

10810788,"Project Summary
The timely delivery of membrane-bound vesicles and tubules bearing transmembrane protein and lipid cargoes
to discrete cellular membranes is fundamental to cell biology and human health. Many proteins associated with
trafficking pathways are linked to serious and crippling human diseases, especially neurological diseases and
disorders. Although many trafficking proteins and some pathways are well characterized, we still do not
understand other trafficking pathways that we infer must exist between membranes. This constitutes an
enormous gap in our understanding of fundamental cell biology. Our goal is to elucidate the molecular
structures and functions of important coat protein complexes that initiate trafficking pathways by forming coats
around vesicles or tubules. Coat proteins recognize and package relevant cargoes, and they promote efficient
assembly of additional required protein components, like accessory proteins and SNAREs. Clathrin coats have
long served as an important paradigm, but increasing evidence demonstrates how other coats use distinct
mechanisms. We investigate the retromer and Assembly Polypeptide (AP) family of coat complexes (COPI,
AP-4, AP-5) by using a variety of tools to ascertain molecular mechanisms of coat assembly and regulation.
Biochemical approaches allow us to identify and test new interactions in coat complexes, including how
accessory and regulatory proteins drive function. Integrated structural methods including X-ray crystallography,
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) provide detailed evidence for
how coats interact with key partners and allow us to generate specific hypotheses to test function. Biophysical
techniques enable us to quantify binding affinities and to probe interfaces identified in structural models. With
collaborators, we use molecular data to design experiments in cultured cell lines or in model organisms to
explore how protein-protein interactions drive phenotypes at the cellular or organismal levels. Ultimately, we
hope to gain a molecular understanding of how coats assemble at distinct membranes to drive different
trafficking pathways. We anticipate this work will reveal new mechanisms of coat assembly and regulation and
will provide fundamental insights into the protein networks that underlie key cellular events on membranes."
10810791,"Title: Nematicidal chalcones: a genetic approach to uncovering the action mechanism
Project Summary/Abstract:
Parasitic Nematodes (PNs) are enemy to both plant and animals (including humans). These parasites have a
tremendous impact on medicine, veterinary medicine, and agriculture, causing human infections and mortality
(see WHO “Soil-transmitted helminth infections” factsheet) and significant annual monetary losses. For example,
there is an estimated loss of $157 billion worldwide (Li et al., 2007) due to infestation by plant parasitic
nematodes. Therefore, developing new nematicidal agents and understanding their mechanism of action is of
paramount importance; it is likely that a solution to nematode control will come from the use of cocktails of
nematicidal agents, which can control nematodes in different ways. Previous work in our lab identified two
organic chalcones (chalcones 17 and 30) as effective nematicidals on Caenorhabditis elegans and the plant
parasitic nematode Meloidogyne incognita (Saeed, et al. 2012, and Calderón-Urrea, et al., unpublished results).
Furthermore, these chalcones have no significant effects on either soil microorganisms or human cells
(Calderón-Urrea, et al., unpublished results). However, the mechanism of action of these chalcones is not known.
It is possible that these chalcones target essential proteins (enzymes), which are rendered infective by the
chalcones. If this is the case, alterations in the binding of the chalcones to said proteins can be a powerful tool
to elucidate the mechanism of action of the chalcones. We hypothesize that “the susceptibility to chalcones is
due to the action of the chalcone on a protein product, perhaps an enzyme, and therefore mutations on the gene
(or genes) encoding that protein will render the chalcone action ineffective”. We are testing this hypothesis by
conducting a forward genetic screen on mutagenized C. elegans nematodes, and characterizing the isolated
mutants. The specific objectives of this project are: 1) To test resistance to chalcones 17 and 30 and identification
of mutants overcoming chalcone effects; 2) Characterization of chalcone resistant mutants; and 3) Identification
of the DNA sequences involved in the chalcone resistant mutants. The PI will use his extensive experience in
recruiting and training students, particularly from underrepresented groups in sciences, to actively engage them
in the execution of this project."
10810793,"Cognitive health is central to successful aging, independence and well-being. The prevalence of dementia is
increasing in the U.S. and there are no effective therapies to prevent cognitive decline or to treat Alzheimer's
disease (AD) and related dementia. Neuroinflammation, including systemic immune cells, contributes to
neurodegeneration in AD and age-related dementias. Convincing evidence from animal models of AD, large
human genetic association studies of AD and dementia imaging markers, and small human case-control
studies of AD, demonstrate a role for immune cells and processes in the disease. The complex relationships
among the peripheral immune system, cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, and cognitive health are not
yet understood. Understanding the biologic mechanisms connecting circulating immune cells and cognitive
aging holds the potential to identify new blood based biomarkers and novel therapies for cognitive decline,
dementia and AD. We propose a comprehensive investigation of the role of circulating immune cells across the
spectrum of cognitive aging in the community-based Framingham Offspring cohort. The cohort is deeply
phenotyped for cognitive outcomes, including longitudinal dementia surveillance and repeated neuro-
psychological (NP) tests and brain MRI. We hypothesize that we will identify novel associations between
immune cell phenotypes in the pro-inflammatory and regulatory pathways and incident adverse cognitive
outcomes including development of clinical dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and measures of
cognitive aging defined by NP testing and brain MRI scans. We will investigate whether vascular factors
associated with immune cell phenotypes mediate the relationships, as vascular factors increase susceptibility
to cognitive aging. We will test our hypotheses with the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: To profile circulating immune cell phenotypes in a dementia and stroke free community based sample
of men and women across a wide age range (n=1000, mean age 63, range 40 to 88) and identify cross-
sectional correlates of the immune cell phenotypes including age and sex.
Aim 2: To identify circulating immune cell phenotypes in the pro-inflammatory and regulatory pathways that
are risk factors for incident cognitive aging outcomes (dementia including AD and cognitive aging measures
based on NP testing and MRI brain volumes). We will test whether associations differ by sex and genetic risk.
Aim 3. To investigate whether the cognitive-outcome related immune cell phenotypes identified in Aim 2 are
associated with vascular factors known to increase susceptibility to cognitive aging including incident
cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease and vascular risk factors.
This work will uncover novel mechanistic insights into the relations between circulating immune cell
phenotypes and the aging brain, identify new biomarkers for cognitive decline, and may reveal novel
therapeutic targets to prevent and treat dementia consistent with NIAs strategic goals for aging research."
10810848,"Project Summary & Abstract
In the US, it is estimated that at least 1% of children suffer from alcohol-related growth and neurocognitive
defects associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). One of the major confounding elements in the
study of this disorder is the enormous variation observed in both incidence and severity. The observed variance
in FASD phenotypes indicates that multiple factors beyond the incidence of maternal drinking play a significant
role in the development of this condition. Over the past 40 years, clinical studies have reported that 75% of
FASD children have biological fathers who were either heavy drinkers or chronic alcoholics. However, the role
of preconception male alcohol consumption in the development of FASD birth defects remains unexplored,
largely due to the misconception that sperm do not transmit heritable information beyond the genetic code.
Using a well-established mouse model, preconception male alcohol exposure has been associated with both
prenatal and postnatal growth restriction, abnormalities in placental growth and sex-specific alterations in the
long-term metabolic health of the offspring. The defects identified in these animal studies are similar to those
described in long-term clinical studies of FASD children and reveal that paternal drug use is a significant
modifier of offspring health. However, the molecular mechanisms by which paternal exposures prior to
conception impact offspring development remain poorly defined. Further, the ability of paternal alcohol use to
interact with gestational alcohol exposures and exacerbate the development FASDs has never been tested. This
proposal responds to `PA-18-507 - Effects of In Utero Alcohol Exposure on Adult Health and Disease' and will
define the basic fundamental mechanisms by which male preconception exposure to alcohol impacts the
developmental program of the fetus and contributes to the incidence of FASD birth defects. Identifying a link
between male alcohol use and a disorder that, until now, has been almost exclusively associated with the
decisions of the birthmother, will hopefully prompt a shift of epidemiological perspectives that will more fully
consider the lifestyle choices of the birthfather in the development of alcohol-related growth and neurocognitive
defects."
10808456,"Approximately 50,000 infants are born less than 28 weeks’ gestation in the United States each year, and the
development of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in these infants is common. However, difficulties
with early identification of at-risk infants and incomplete knowledge of modifiable risk factors have hampered
improvements in BPD care. Acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluid overload are emerging risk factors for severe
BPD in premature infants. A more complete understanding of how AKI and fluid overload in infants impacts the
development of BPD could lead to better-targeted interventions in the early neonatal period as AKI and fluid
overload are both preventable and treatable conditions. My long-term career goal is to develop a portfolio of
research focusing on the relationship between lung and kidney disease in premature infants and decreasing
the incidence of BPD in premature infants by identifying and mitigating kidney-based risk factors. This K23
proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a research project to
establish critical kidney-based candidates for early detection of severe BPD in premature infants and develop a
clinical prediction model to identify premature infants at risk for severe BPD. My central hypothesis is that
acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluid overload contribute to severe BPD development and are linked by
angiogenesis. Specific aims for the K23 are to: (1) Develop a clinical prediction model that uses markers of
kidney disease to estimate severe BPD risk in premature infants, and (2) Identify longitudinal patterns of
angiogenesis biomarkers in premature infants that predict BPD. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that a clinical
prediction model which incorporates both AKI and fluid overload will more accurately identify BPD in premature
infants than an existing model. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that premature infants with AKI and subsequent
severe BPD will have altered patterns of angiogenesis during their neonatal hospitalization. Through my career
development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will develop expertise in a) bronchopulmonary dysplasia
and angiogenesis, b) machine learning and health informatics, and c) clinical trial design and biostatistical
principles. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary
groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R01 grant
funding from the NHLBI in year 4 of my K23 award to develop individualized fluid management and AKI
detection/treatment protocols for testing in a clinical trial. I will also apply for an R03 in year 3 to further
augmented the developed clinical prediction models with biomarkers. Overall, my proposed line of research is
the first step in a career focused on the detection, monitoring and treatment of kidney-based risk factors for
BPD in premature infants. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of a multidisciplinary team of faculty
with expertise in health services research, clinical trials, machine learning, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and
kidney disease."

Endocrine therapy (ET) resistance and metastasis are major obstacles for curing patients with advanced
ERα+ breast cancer (ER+ BC). Upregulated oncogenic ERα activity plays critical role in advanced
progression of ER+ BC. One essential mechanism of regulating ERα signaling is the ubiquitination-
dependent proteasomal degradation of ERα and its co-activators such as steroid receptor coactivator 3
(SRC-3, also known as amplified in breast cancer 1). Owing to its direct effect of targeting ERα for
degradation, fulvestrant is the only FDA-approved selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) as a first
line endocrine agent for metastatic and locally advanced breast cancer and a second line drug for
advanced metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor
treatment. Unfortunately, either de novo or acquired resistance to fulvestrant occurs in the majority of
the patients with advanced ER+ BCs. The molecular mechanism underlying fulvestrant resistance is still
largely unknown. The proposed study aims to test an intriguing hypothesis that the F-Box protein FBXL16
stimulates oncogenic ERα activity by upregulating the stability and expression levels of ERα and
coactivator SRC-3, thereby promoting breast cancer development, metastatic progression and
endocrine therapy (ET) resistance. Two specific aims will be performed. Aim 1 is to determine the roles
of FBXL16 in regulating the stability and expression levels of ERα and ERα LBD mutants; Aim 2 is to
determine the role of FBXL16 in ER+ breast tumor growth, metastasis and endocrine therapy resistance.
By conducting a variety of both in vitro and cell-based assays and in vivo tumor mouse model
experiments, we expect to elucidate how FBXL16 upregulates the protein stability of ERα and ERα-LBD
mutants and to determine the roles of FBXL16 in breast tumor development, metastasis and ET
resistance. Our ultimate goal is to define FXBL16 as a new prognostic marker and/or a therapeutic drug
target for treating advanced ER+ BCs, particularly in the patients with either de novo or acquired
resistance to SERDs including those with ERα LBD activating mutations."
10794567,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Most applications of genomics in modern oncology focus on somatic mutations acquired during tumor
evolution and selecting drugs to target these tumor-specific mutations. While effective, these approaches usually
do not consider the broader context of a patient’s inherited (i.e., germline) genetics, which is a major source of
cancer risk that can modify the effects of somatic mutations and alter therapeutic responses. This focus on
somatic mutations is also a major limitation for cancers driven by the RAS oncogene family, which are recalcitrant
to virtually all targeted therapies. Somatic RAS alterations are common in many cancers—especially pancreatic,
colorectal, skin, and lung tumors (hereafter: “RAS-driven cancers”)—but are difficult to inhibit pharmacologically.
These cancers comprise 39% of all cancer-related deaths in the USA each year, many of which could be
prevented if their cancers were intercepted at earlier stages. This reflects an urgent opportunity to reduce cancer-
related mortality by unifying germline and somatic genetics to prioritize high-risk individuals for screening or early
intervention and to identify novel targets for therapeutic development. In this proposal, I outline a strategy to
dissect the impact of germline genetics in RAS-driven cancers. During the K99 phase, I will discover germline
factors that modify RAS oncogenicity in a unique collection of somatic, germline, clinical, and/or transcriptomic
data for >35,000 individuals. During the R00 phase, I will nucleate an independent research program around a
comprehensive computational framework for the genome-wide detection of germline risk factors for cancer
spanning the full spectrum of variation accessible to genome sequencing, with an emphasis on understudied
classes of variation like structural and rare noncoding variants. I will apply this method to systematically map
genetic risk factors for RAS-driven cancers in a diverse set of >10,200 patients and >17,100 cancer-free controls.
 My long-term career goal is to usher in a new era of preventative precision oncology by unlocking the
potential of human genomics to illuminate the heritable causes of cancer initiation and progression. My mentors
and I have developed a comprehensive training plan in cancer biology and medical oncology for my K99 phase
that will prepare me to launch a successful independent career at the intersection of genomics, cancer, and data
science in the R00 phase. My postdoctoral training will be supervised Dr. Eliezer Van Allen, who is a world-
leader in computational oncology. I will also benefit from the complementary expertise of two co-mentors in Drs.
Alexander Gusev (statistics) and Kevin Haigis (RAS biology), who will buttress Dr. Van Allen’s mentorship and
ensure I build a well-rounded skillset during the mentored K99 phase to lay the foundation for a highly productive
independent R00 phase. Finally, my proposed research plan will be facilitated by the outstanding scientific
environment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, which is the ideal ecosystem to support my postdoctoral phase."
10796773,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Latinos living in the 50 United States (US; hereinafter States), the largest racial/ethnic minority US population,
are 1.5 times more likely to have Alzheimer’s disease than non-Latino whites. Latinos in the States exhibit
unique profiles of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) disparities across ethnic backgrounds
(namely, Cubans, Dominicans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and South and Central Americans). For example,
Puerto Ricans are the Latino background with the lowest cognitive scores and highest prevalence of mild
cognitive impairment and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors-- long associated with higher ADRD risk.
Thus, it is not surprising that ADRD is also a growing crisis among Latinos living in the US territory (island) of
Puerto Rico (PR). In fact, the age-adjusted AD mortality rate in PR is double that of Latinos in the States.
Unfortunately, research on protective factors that may serve as targets for promoting cognitive and brain health
among Latinos in the States is scant and even less is known among Latinos in PR. As an early stage
investigator, born and raised in PR, with doctoral training in community health sciences and post-doctoral
training on CVD epidemiology, this K01 would the provide new skills and training in theories of resilience and
reserve as well as content knowledge on normative cognitive aging, brain structure and neuroimaging, and
protective factors for healthy aging. This K01 would also achieve the overall research goal of examining the
mechanisms through which protective factors shown important in older non-Latino whites, i.e., favorable body
composition, better psychological health, and higher levels of cognitive enrichment, support cognitive and brain
health in middle-aged and older Latinos (ages 45+) with an emphasis on PR. Specifically, Aim 1 is focused on
resilience to age; we will investigate baseline protective factors related with maintenance of cognitive function
over a 7-year follow-up period (i.e., cognitive resilience to age) and examine whether protective factors modify
the cross-sectional relation of age with brain structure (i.e., brain resilience to age) using previously collected
data from the largest epidemiological study of Latino health in the States, the Hispanic Community Health
Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) Visits 1 and 2 and its NIA-funded SOL-INCA and SOL-INCA MRI ancillary
studies. Aim 2 is focused on cognitive reserve; we will test whether protective factors modify the cross-
sectional relations of brain structure with cognition by leveraging data from SOL-INCA MRI and SOL-INCA.
Aim 3 is focused on PR, we will administer the HCHS/SOL cognitive battery in the NHLBI-funded PROSPECT
cohort, an island-wide longitudinal epidemiological study of health, to estimate cognition and compare the
protective factors-cognition relations between Puerto Ricans in PROSPECT and HCHS/SOL. This research is
responsive to the priority areas of the NIA of identifying protective factors associated with successful cognitive
aging in ADRD disparities populations. The proposed research will provide preliminary data to conduct a larger
epidemiological R01 study on resilience and reserve among adults living in PR."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder that affects >3 million Americans and is a
major cause of stroke. Since AF is primarily an age-related disease, it is fast becoming an epidemic in a rapidly
aging population. Unfortunately, current therapeutic approaches to AF – both pharmacological and ablation-
based - are sub-optimal in patients with persistent AF. This is thought to be because current treatments do not
target the fundamental, molecular mechanisms that cause AF. Over the last several years, the Arora lab at
Northwestern University has worked hard to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying AF, with
the long term goal of developing a mechanism-guided therapeutic approach to AF. Work done in the Arora lab
over the last several years in large animal models of AF has demonstrated that autonomic nervous system
signaling, oxidative injury and CAMKII signaling are important mechanisms leading to electrical remodeling of
key ion channels and excitation contraction coupling proteins in the atrium, thereby leading to the
establishment of substrate for paroxysmal AF. The goal of the Arora lab over the next several years is to obtain
a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the progression of paroxysmal AF to
persistent AF. We postulate that structural changes in the atrium such as new parasympathetic nerve
sprouting, NLRP3 inflammasome mediated fibrosis and HDAC6 mediated breakdown of microtubules (derailed
proteastasis) are key mechanisms underlying this progression of AF. We will study these mechanisms in
chronically tachypaced large animal models of AF by using novel gene therapy approaches developed in our
lab over the last several years. Success of these gene therapy approaches in arresting progression of
paroxysmal AF to persistent AF will also demonstrate their therapeutic potential. Since our eventual goal is to
develop a clinically viable gene therapy approach for persistent AF, we have recently conceived of a highly
novel electroporation-based approach to facilitate trans-venous gene delivery. In addition to identifying novel
gene therapy targets for AF, another major goal of this R35 proposal will be to fully develop and optimize this
gene delivery approach.
The next phase of the research proposed in the Arora lab is not only expected to give fresh mechanistic
insights into the creation of an atrial myopathy that supports persistent AF, but is also expected to led to the
development of new, potentially paradigm-shifting therapeutic approaches to AF."

 Neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is characterized by a protracted series of
pathophysiological events that, without intervention, are devastating. HIE can result in neurodevelopmental
delays, epilepsy, cognitive and motor issues, or death. The current standard of clinical care for infants born at
term with severe hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is hypothermia. Therapeutic hypothermia reduces the likelihood of death
and lessens deficits in some behavioral outcome measures. However, neuroprotection is far from complete. The
major goal of this proposal is to use the well-established Rice-Vannucci HI rodent model to develop a translational
strategy for improving neuroprotection by targeting mitochondrial Complex I. Although Complex I function is
necessary for the recovery of brain energy metabolism after acute energy failure, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
produced by Complex I during the recovery phase contribute to secondary injury. Apoptotic cell death and
neuroinflammation also contribute to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. It is unknown whether these mechanisms
depend on Complex I alterations in vivo. Our published findings demonstrate that the preclinical drug mdivi-1
inhibits Complex I-dependent ROS production while only mildly and reversibly inhibiting mitochondrial
respiration. Our new data suggest a direct interaction of mdivi-1 with a subunit of Complex I. We find that mdivi-
1 significantly reduces the occurrence of severe rat brain tissue loss measured 3 days after HI and decreases
3-nitrotyrosine labeling, a marker of oxidative stress, in the hippocampus,. Mechanistically, we find that mdivi-1
interacts with Complex I in microglia, the innate immune cells mediating the persistent neuroinflammatory
response after neonatal HI. Mdivi-1 shows inhibition of microglial pro-inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo.
 The central hypothesis of this study is that mdivi-1 will additively enhance hypothermic neuroprotection
in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury models by reducing Complex I-dependent oxidative stress. We predict
benefit in both male and female animals, though through potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms. Males and
females differ in dominant cell death pathways, and males exhibit greater vulnerability to chronic microglial
activation after HI. A novel mouse model of partial Complex I deficiency showing normal neurodevelopment will
be used to establish whether neuroprotection by mdivi-1 or hypothermia is occluded by a moderate reduction in
the level of assembled Complex I. This genetic method will also reveal whether Complex I dysfunction contributes
to HI-induced apoptosis or neuroinflammation in the immature brain of either sex. Positive outcomes will support
the development of reversible Complex I inhibitors for clinical use, with the hope that this class of drugs may
ultimately help millions by reducing the devastating consequences of neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy."

Minoritized individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have approximately 2% higher average A1c levels and twice
the rate of hospitalizations, complications, and mortality as their white counterparts. However, the efficacy trials
establishing the benefits of hybrid closed loop (HCL) pump therapy in T1D have been in more socially
advantaged and predominantly non-Hispanic white patients. Use of this transformative technology by individuals
with T1D from underserved communities remains very low. We plan to conduct a randomized effectiveness trial
- with broader eligibility criteria (including markedly elevated A1c) and longer (9 month) follow up than the pivotal
HCL efficacy trials - to evaluate the benefits, safety risks and treatment complications of HCL use in underserved
adults with T1D (Specific Aim 1). Primary outcome will be % time-in-range 70-180 mg/dL, and secondary
outcomes will include % time < 70 mg/dL, DKA events and body weight. The HCL arm in the trial will include
three HCL systems (BetaBionics iLet, Insulet OP 5, Tandem Control IQ) that vary in degree of automation and
user input required for operation. More automated systems could potentially better match the needs of
underserved individuals with competing life demands that limit diabetes self-care; however, the potential benefits
of automation are at the cost of less personal control of the system, including adjustments for work-shift changes
and activity. Specific Aim 2 incorporates the novel application of Ecological Momentary Assessment to examine
the lived experience with HCL (including benefits and burdens, the impact of life stressors impact on HCL use,
and how the match between HCL system functionality and the individual’s needs and expectations impacts on
user experience). In Specific Aim 3, in collaboration with a user-centered designer, we will apply the learnings
from the study to develop: 1) Improved HCL patient education and clinician support tools; and 2) Decision-aids
to guide patient selection of the HCL system that is most aligned with personal preferences and needs. These
optimized training materials and decision-aids will set the stage for the translation of our research findings into
increased adoption of HCL in underserved communities and improved shared decision-making by patients and
clinicians in the selection of HCL systems."

Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disability in the United States. Smoking cessation
rates have stagnated in recent years, underscoring the need for innovative, accessible methods to support
cessation. Emerging neurobiological and behavioral research indicate that the intentional sniffing of olfactory stimuli
(OS) can fundamentally alter emotional states and reduce cigarette craving. Yet, no work has evaluated the
potential for OS as an adjunctive intervention to facilitate successful smoking cessation. The proposed project aims
to refine and test a novel biobehavioral smoking cessation intervention that integrates the strategic application of
OS to reduce cigarette craving with an established smartphone-based smoking cessation application. Our
previously published work indicated that OS can relieve cigarette craving, and our recent pilot data showed that
these effects may hold in the natural environment to help smokers resist smoking. This work provides the rationale
for conducting the proposed clinical trial. Still, research is needed to determine the precise methodology for OS
administration in the context of a smoking cessation attempt and to preliminarily evaluate the potential of OS when
integrated with an established phone-based smoking cessation app before conducting a full-scale R01 smoking
cessation trial. Building on our prior work, the current proposal aims to (1) refine the design and methodology for our
novel, first-generation olfactory stimulation delivery system (OSDS; Phase I), and (2) determine the adjunctive benefit
of the OSDS when integrated with a smartphone-based smoking cessation application (Smart-T; Phase II). This trial
integrates theory-driven basic research derived from three disciplines independently related to smoking, but not
jointly examined in the context of applied smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition). Phase I will consist
of a crossover, micro-randomized controlled trial in which treatment-seeking smokers (N=32) will receive the
nicotine patch and engage in a self-guided quit attempt for 14 days. During the 14-day trial, participants will use our
OSDS daily and complete daily ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). Phase I participants will complete a
qualitative interview and quantitative survey at the end of the trial. Phase II will consist of a randomized controlled
trial, in which participants (N = 100) will be randomized to our smartphone app for smoking cessation (Smart-T) with
nicotine patch or the Smart-T app with nicotine patch and OSDS as an adjunctive feature (Smart-T+O). Participants
will complete a baseline assessment, daily EMAs for 13 weeks (1-week pre-quit and 12-week post-quit), and a
follow-up assessment at 12 weeks post-quit via the app. The proposed project will provide vital data to refine a
protocol for assessing a phone-based cigarette smoking intervention that integrates an OS approach to craving
relief. Accordingly, it will provide the data needed to successfully conduct a full-scale clinical trial evaluating this
novel approach to smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research will advance knowledge
regarding the integration of OS-based craving relief with a mobile health approach to smoking cessation."
10812349,"Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a high-morbidity, beta-globin blood disorder that causes hemolysis and vaso-
occlusion, leading to pain, organ damage and premature death. A key barrier to progress is that current
disease-monitoring biomarkers correlate weakly with clinical outcomes because they do not directly measure
the mechanisms that cause clinical pathology. The transparent media of the eye presents the opportunity to
directly visualize the retinal microvasculature, as an indirect representation of the microvascular status of other
organ systems and to quantify transient interruptions in blood flow (a major cause of SCD pathology). Our
group found that new approaches to quantifying retinal perfusion abnormalities, such as mapping variably
perfused areas and comparing them over minutes to hours, can produce reliable metrics of retinal perfusion
that predict SCD severity and mortality better than any currently available clinical biomarker. Using Optical
coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) we
hypothesize that innovations in retinal imaging may be leveraged to create new biomarkers to guide disease
monitoring and improve mechanistic understanding of disease. In our preliminary work, we developed several
highly-reliable retinal perfusion metrics, identified 4 mechanisms of small-vessel occlusion in SCD, and showed
that one novel perfusion metric, between-session intermittent flow index (IFI), outperformed all current
biomarkers as a measure of disease severity and predictor of mortality. We propose to conduct a prospective
cohort study using serial retinal imaging and clinical data collection to 1) develop reliable metrics of retinal
perfusion (as determined by coefficients of variation and indexes of individuality), 2) validate perfusion metrics
as objective indicators of disease severity, treatment response and mortality risk, and 3) compare the
mechanisms that cause microvascular occlusion among the 5 major SCD phenotypes. To ensure maximum
generalizability and potential for harmonization with other data sources, clinical data will be collected using
tools developed from the NHLBI Sickle Cell Implementation Consortium Clinical Data Registry. To accomplish
these important goals, the proposed project brings together expertise in ophthalmology, retinal imaging, high-
efficiency study design and analyses for rare diseases, stakeholder engagement and SCD."

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common familial cardiovascular disorder viewed as a genetic disease
of the sarcomere, since most mutations occur in genes that encode sarcomere/cytoskeletal proteins. Despite
decades of basic and clinical research, there are critical gaps in our knowledge concerning how defective
biophysical signals in the myocyte influence the function of other cellular compartments of the heart during the
clinical course of this disorder. We have reported that early interventions aimed at normalizing myofilament
properties only partially prevent HCM progression. Moreover, removal of the triggering mutation does not
always reverse progression. In experiments proposed here, we test the overall hypothesis that critical, but
treatable, maladaptive modifications in the vascular/endothelial compartment occur early and in parallel with
changes in myofilament properties in the progression of HCM linked to thin filament mutations triggering
different biophysical and biochemical signals. Preliminary data strongly support a role for and a need to
investigate vascular remodeling and endothelial dysfunction that exacerbate symptomatic HCM. Novel data
support our focus on HIPPO/YAP/TAZ signaling with emphasis on protective effects of sphingsine-1-phosphate
receptor (S1PR) signaling, which is common to the endothelium (EC) and myocytes (CM). Our aims are as
follows: Aim 1. Determine the decline in coronary function, changes in vascular remodeling and mechano-
sensing in HCM linked to mutationsTnT-R92Q and Tm-E180G with different signaling in progression to HCM.
Aim 2. Establish whether restoration of the endothelial HIPPO pathway is sufficient to impede HCM
progression. Evidence provided here for a role of EC HIPPO/YAP/TAZ signaling in HCM progression demands
an investigation of the consequences of its regulation, and whether therapeutic interventions modify HIPPO
signaling. Aim 3. Evaluate the microenvironmental signals responsible for HIPPO pathway dysregulation and
co-translation expression of activated YAP/TAZ protective mediators in HCM. Our approach includes
determination of the time course of changes in coronary flow velocity, vascular/endothelial histology, and
mechano-sensing through key components of the HIPPO pathway, with changes in cardiac function and the
myofilaments Ca2+-response during HCM progression. We will treat mouse models early in HCM progression
with S1PR agonists, and small molecule inhibitors to normalize myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and tension to
examine whether they restore EC HIPPO pathway and angiogenic signaling. We will identity EC and CM
specific disease signaling networks and determine whether HCM leads to impaired S1P export and paracrine
function, by enriching and probing the ""functional co-translatome"" in the RiboTag reporter mice crossed with
HCM mutations. Accomplishing our aims will provide discovery of targets for effective and individualized
therapies for HCM."

T cells have the potential to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. However, most often cancers progress in spite
of the tumor-specific T cells present within tumors. While current immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint
blockade can bring about long-lasting remissions in some patients with certain cancer types, most patients are
not cured. Using a genetic liver cancer mouse model, we previously demonstrated that tumor-specific T cells,
after entering malignant livers, rapidly differentiate to an early and then late dysfunctional state, encoded by
distinct epigenetic programs. Late dysfunctional tumor-specific T cells failed to become functional again in
response to immune checkpoint blockade, and we found that human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from patients
with solid tumors shared key epigenetic hallmarks of late dysfunctional T cells from our mouse liver cancer
model. Thus, a critical challenge for cancer immunotherapy is how to prevent or revert tumor-specific T cells
from entering this epigenetically-enforced dysfunctional state. We now find that late TST fail to proliferate in
response to T cell receptor stimulation, and we hypothesize that the barrier to functional rescue of late
dysfunctional tumor-specific T cells is their inability to enter cell cycle in response to TCR stimulation. We will
leverage our preclinical mouse cancer models and study TIL in liver and breast tumors from human patients to
(i) understand how cell cycle kinetics and T cell receptor signaling defects change during dysfunctional
differentiation, (ii) define how cell cycle and epigenetic changes determine functional rescue, and (iii) test
strategies to overcome cell cycle and TCR signaling defects in late dysfunctional T cells. These studies will
uncover critical insights into how cell cycle and T cell receptor signaling regulate the T cell epigenome and test
therapeutically-applicable strategies to overcome barriers to tumor-specific T cell reprogramming, which may
lead to improved cancer immunotherapies."
10801085,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are two reasons Americans mostly
require a liver transplant. Furthermore, aldehyde dehydrogenase gene 2 (ALDH2) deficiency, which impairs
alcohol and lipid metabolism, affects ~560 million people globally.
Our earlier studies show that a pathway from TGF-β to βII-spectrin (encodes the disordered protein βII-spectrin)
via SMAD3 (a TGF-β -activated transcription factor) is essential for proper development of the liver and
preventing many liver pathologies. βII-spectrin-deficient mice are highly susceptible to alcohol-induced liver
injury, and complete knockout of this gene results in embryonic death with features like fetal alcohol syndrome.
Compromised TGF-β signaling through SMAD3 and βII-spectrin dysregulates ALDH1A and ALDH2 genes and
disrupts DNA repair, contributing to oncogenesis from elongated telomeres and genome instability.
To explore the roles of βII-spectrin and the TGF-β pathway in aldehyde-related and alcohol-related liver injury,
we generated Aldh2-/-Sptbn1+/- (ASKO) double-knockout mice, which become obese and develop NASH and
characteristics of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Their livers have altered lipid profiles, increased reactive
aldehydes, and increased lipid synthesis. Treating Aldh2-/- mice with siRNA targeting βII-spectrin reduces diet-
induced lipid accumulation and improves glucose handling. We hypothesize that hepatocyte stress from high
lipid levels, reactive aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxynonenol (4-HNE), or inflammation activates caspases that
cleave βII-spectrin, which, in turn, promote lipid synthesis by interacting with SREBP1 (sterol regulatory element
binding protein1). This process also diverts βII-spectrin from TGF-β-SMAD3 signaling, activating fibrogenic and
oncogenic pathways instead. We will explore how cleavage of βII-spectrin and aldehyde-modification of βII-
spectrin affect the interactions between βII-spectrin, SMAD3, and SREBP1 by addressing the following specific
aims:
Aim 1. Determine the hepatocyte-specific roles of βII-spectrin by studying Aldh2-/- mice crossed with liver-specific
Sptbn1 knockout mice.
Aim 2. Define molecular mechanisms by which the interaction between βII-spectrin and SREBP1 promotes
lipogenesis.
Aim 3. Assess the translational relevance of SPTBN1 and ALDH2 in human obesity and NASH, and if
pathological effects are reduced by siRNA targeting βII-spectrin.
The outlined studies are aimed at improving the understanding of diet-induced fatty liver disease in the context
of ALDH2 deficiency. The outcomes promise to expose the many intricacies of liver diseases and inform the
development of novel intervention strategies for liver-associated diseases, such as MetS, ALD, NAFLD, and
NASH."

A common pathological state strongly associated with both obesity and aging is insulin resistance (IR) in which
cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. IR is a hallmark of prediabetes, affecting a third of Americans. It
also represents a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus, physical dysfunction, heart disease, and dementia.
Other than exercise and diet, limited mechanism-based strategies exist to improve IR. Another shared feature
of obesity and aging is accumulation of p21Cip1–highly-expressing (p21high) cells in various tissues. However, the
roles of p21high cells in IR and physical dysfunction remain largely unknown. To examine the relationship between
p21high cells and IR, we have generated and validated a novel “p21-Cre” transgenic mouse model containing a
p21 promoter driving a Cre fused to a tamoxifen-inducible estrogen receptor (ER) element. This novel model
enables us to monitor, kill or modulate p21high cells in vivo without affecting other cells. In our preliminary studies,
we find that intermittent clearance of p21high cells in obese mice significantly alleviates IR, indicating that
strategies targeting these cells could result in novel approaches for managing IR and metabolic dysfunction.
Based on these findings, we will test our central hypothesis that targeting p21high cells will alleviate metabolic
and physical dysfunction associated with obesity. We will use p21-Cre mouse models to examine the role (Aim
1) and underlying mechanism (Aim 2) of p21high cells in IR and physical dysfunction. We will also leverage
powerful single cell transcriptomics (SCT) technology to reveal the heterogeneity and conserved transcriptomic
features of these p21high cells in tissues with obesity. This project will have a broad impact on both aging and
obesity research by determining how p21high cells contribute to IR. Using multiple in vivo models, coupled with
the powerful approach of single cell transcriptomics, we expect to gain a comprehensive understanding of p21high
cells (at both functional and expression levels) in vivo. Results from this work will also enable future testing of
pharmacological interventions that eliminate these cells to treat not only metabolic dysfunction, but also a wide
range of age-related diseases."

The ability of cells to divide, establish a polarization direction, and move by crawling requires the coordinated
interactions of the cytoskeleton with membranes as well as with the signaling system organizing on
membranes. A major challenge for the development of predictive mathematical and computational models of
these mechanisms of subcellular organization is accounting of how highly specific interactions at the molecular
level lead to the emergent collective behavior. We propose to address this complexity by employing powerful
computational and modeling methods linking molecular to cellular scales, in close collaboration with
experimentalists working on model systems that (i) reveal important cell biological functions and (ii) are
amenable to quantitative approaches. The proposed research program will address mechanisms in
cytokinesis, cell polarization and motility. A. Cytokinesis. We have previously modeled how the contractile ring
in fission yeast forms through the condensation a broad band of membrane-bound nodes containing myosin
and formin. These models represented nodes, which are large macromolecular complexes, as single units with
the ability to polymerize and pull actin. Using input from super-resolution experiments and applying coarse-
grained biophysical modeling and Bayesian inference methods, we propose to model the ultrastructure and
dynamics of nodes, how this organization impacts their ability to capture and pull actin filaments, as well as the
role of type V myosin. We will develop models to study how membrane delivery is distributed across the whole
septum and how it coordinates with contractile ring constriction and tension. B. Cell polarization and ER
organization. We will study how the Cdc42/Ras1 system establishes patterns with distinct spatial distributions
of GEF and GAP regulators on cell membrane. Novel modeling methods will be developed to understand how
the ER membrane is distributed subcellularly on cortical sheets adhered to the plasma membrane, cortical
fenestrae anchored to eisosomes and internal tubular networks, altogether regulating cell polarization. C. Actin
dynamics in motile cells. We will develop filament-level models of actin dynamics and organization in
lamellipodia that account for their dendritic network structure, distributed turnover, force transmission and
mechanical regulation of branching, severing and polymerization. In collaboration with the Watanabe group
(Kyoto University), we will test these models by measuring turnover and flows near focal adhesions with single
molecule imaging of actin and regulators."

Metastatic melanoma was until recently considered an untreatable disease, but the discovery of small
molecules that inhibit oncogenic BRAF(V600E) and approaches that unleash the immune system against
tumors have brought hope to melanoma patients. Not every patient will have meaningful therapeutic benefit
from these treatments and durable disease remission remains elusive for most. Among the causes of the
failure to respond or early relapse is a dynamic cancer cell heterogeneity that facilitates outgrowth of therapy
resistant tumors with enhanced malignancy traits. In order to extend the use of current therapies, we propose
to identify alternative molecular targets that could be harnessed for combinatorial treatment exploit and might
hold promise for sustainable therapeutic benefit. Specifically, whether metabolic and epigenetic processes
provide collateral dependencies within highly metastatic and chronic BRAF-targeted drug-adapted melanomas
is largely unknown. To this end, a third of melanomas display heightened expression of the transcriptional
coactivator PGC1α that integrates mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetic activity to ensure cellular
survival. Previously we found an inverse functional relationship between PGC1α expression and vertical
growth phase within primary melanoma that associates with poor patient prognosis, and genetic targeting of
PGC1α provoked enhanced metastatic traits in cell line models. Consistent with a functional role for adaptive
expression of PGC1α and enhanced malignancy traits, our current preliminary data supports that chronic
adaptation to BRAF-targeted drugs silences PGC1α expression through altered histone marks across its
promoter region. We now propose to seek the molecular mechanisms that attenuate PGC1α expression that
links enhanced metastatic spread and chronic adaptation to BRAF-targeted drugs. In an integrated study plan
that includes clinical melanoma specimens, established cell lines and in vivo tumor modeling, the experimental
design is focused on two aims: 1) to determine epigenetic mechanisms that silence PGC1α expression during
chronic adaptation to targeted BRAF(V600E) treatment; and 2) to identify collateral metabolic and epigenetic
vulnerabilities arising from chronic adaptation to targeted BRAF(V600E) treatment. Outcomes from these
studies will identify metabolites and epigenetic regulators that provoke vulnerabilities within alternate PGC1α-
dependent epigenetic states. Successful completion of the proposed study plan may help predict patients at
heightened clinical risk as well as provide means to break chronic adaptation to BRAF-targeted drugs."
10800946,"Project Summary/Abstract: Pharmacologic treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is very challenging, largely
due to the difficulty of rapidly and specifically delivering drugs to the ischemic region of the brain. Targeted drug
delivery using affinity moieties (e.g., antibodies) can increase the local concentration of drugs, thereby improving
the therapeutic index. But targeting to blood brain barrier (BBB) epitopes such as transferrin and insulin receptors
achieves poor delivery with intravenous administration (e.g., with intravascular targeted-nanocarriers, T-NCs)
and is not selective to the injured region of the brain. New targeting/delivery approaches are needed for AIS.
We and others have demonstrated that Vascular Cellular Adhesion Molecule (VCAM) is highly
overexpressed in the endothelial cells of the penumbra (brain regions at risk of death). Here, we will exploit this
for targeted drug delivery with T-NC. We have demonstrated how VCAM T-NC provides unprecedented
enhancement of drug delivery to the brain after IV administration (>20 times higher vs. precedent approaches),
specifically to the injured brain. In our pilot studies in an animal model of AIS, we observed rapid and specific
uptake of CAM-targeted mAbs and T-NCs encapsulating mRNA encoding for interleukin 10/IL-10 (anti-
inflammatory cytokine), providing targeted treatment that reduced stroke volume by >60% and improved survival
from 60% to 100%.
Central hypothesis: VCAM-directed T-NCs can restore BBB function by delivering therapeutic
RNAs to endothelial cells in the ischemic penumbra and core, limiting sustained inflammation and brain
damage after AIS. We will deliver IL-10 mRNA and siRNA against ICAM with T-NCs, to promote a local anti-
inflammatory environment that will restore BBB homeostasis. Our T-NCs: i) Will target RNAs to the BBB to
decrease BBB permeability to plasma proteins and reduce leukocyte infiltration; ii) Will deliver RNAs with
complementary temporal effects to act at different phases of the disease – IL-10 will reduce inflammation in the
acute phase of AIS, and ICAM siRNA will protect during the subacute one.
In the current proposal, we suggest: Aim 1: Vascular immunophenotype and nanocarrier delivery in
AIS. Aim 2: CAM T-NC to enhance the BBB after AIS. Our deliverables are: i) generate a spatiotemporal
map for the expression of CAMs in the AIS of mice and its vascular accessibility to deliver T-NC, ii) Independently
of the therapeutic efficacy of our approach will validate our central hypothesis as we are going to quantify: i)
expression of the therapeutic mRNA, ii) silencing of ICAM in the BBB, and iii) cellular infiltration. We will also
identify in an unbiased way different pathways affected by ischemic stroke and how these pathways are altered
after the treatment with anti-inflammatory molecules. This will help to identify new targets for treatment. In
addition, we will identify the possible toxicities associated with this therapeutic approach. These results will be
key for further investigations in large animal models."

Nearly one-third of US reproductive aged women have obesity prior to pregnancy and similar numbers have
vitamin D insufficiency (25(OH)D< 20 ng/mL). Both vitamin D deficiency and obesity may impact the
intrauterine and maternal environment to increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes. Risk of obesity and D
deficiency are significantly higher among Black women compared to White women. In addition, well-described
differences in vitamin D metabolites, calcitropic hormones, and vitamin D binding protein (DBP) genotype are
evident in Black women compared to White women. Despite a dramatic increase in awareness of the multiple
roles of vitamin D in human health, little is known about regulation of vitamin D metabolism during pregnancy.
Maternal concentrations of the prohormone 25(OH)D remain constant across pregnancy but concentrations of
the hormone calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D) more than double in early pregnancy and, despite the rapid t1/2 of calcitriol
(~4 h), this hormone remains elevated across the 9-month gestation period. These changes are unique to
pregnancy and do not occur at any other life stage. Marked metabolic changes in D absorption and/or
utilization must occur to support these physiological changes, but these pathways remain largely unexplored at
this key life stage. Obesity increases the risk of vitamin D deficiency but it is unknown if this is due to
sequestration in body fat, obesity-driven changes in the hormone activation or inactivation pathways, or to
other unidentified differences in D absorption and utilization. We recently developed a novel ultra-high
performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method capable of measuring the absorption
of trideuterated-vitamin D3, its conversion into 25(OH)D3 and the subsequent serum half-life of 25(OH)D3. We
will use this innovative approach to examine vitamin D kinetics in non-pregnant and pregnant women. This
approach allows us for the first time in humans, to evaluate metabolic utilization of vitamin D3 and how it
is impacted by pregnancy (Aim 1). Genetic variants in the DBP gene that affect DBP concentration, as well
as genetic variants in other key genes that are directly involved in vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3 production and
utilization, and their contribution to the differences in vitamin D kinetics will be characterized between White
women and Black women whose genetic ancestry will be confirmed with ancestry-informative genetic markers
(Aim 2). The impact of adiposity on outcomes will be addressed by recruiting both normal weight women and
women with obesity in each ancestry group. Body composition will be measured, and subcutaneous abdominal
fat will be collected to 1) evaluate how this storage depot of vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3 is impacted by obesity,
genetic ancestry, and pregnancy and 2) determine how variability in the mass of this storage depot impacts D
kinetics (Aim 3). The proposed research will provide novel data on the maternal metabolic pathways that
impact vitamin D utilization and will identify both modifiable and non-modifiable factors that can be targeted to
improve maternal vitamin D status and fetal vitamin D availability across pregnancy."
10801113,"Abstract. This proposal is disease agnostic and patient centered, focusing on symptoms associated with side
effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPis). Although ICPis are effective in the treatment of several can-
cers, the risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to unrestrained activation of the immune system
presents a significant challenge. Severe irAEs (grade 3 or higher) can be devastating in many ways. The
symptoms associated with severe irAEs can be debilitating, resulting in frequent hospitalizations. Their impact
on quality of life can be significant enough to mandate discontinuation of an ICPi that is having beneficial anti-
tumor activity, resulting in progression of disease and decreased overall survival. In the absence of prompt in-
tervention, severe irAEs may cause life-threatening decline in organ function and are potentially fatal. Our insti-
tution (MD Anderson Cancer Center) has shown that early detection and treatment of irAEs improves treat-
ment outcomes. However, biomarkers to predict a patient’s risk for irAEs that could help in developing surveil-
lance strategies and early diagnosis and management of irAEs are lacking, representing a gap in knowledge.
The overall objective of this application is to build and validate a risk-prediction model and develop a clinical
tool to predict the risk for severe irAEs in patients treated with ICPis. In preliminary studies, we found that poly-
morphism in the germline-encoded T-cell receptor beta (TCRB) variable (TRBV) gene serves as a predictive
biomarker of severe irAEs. We also observed that changes in symptoms reported using the MD Anderson
Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-Immunotherapy measure within the first 3 weeks of immunotherapy initiation are
predictive of subsequent development of severe irAEs. Guided by our preliminary findings, we hypothesize
that integration of TRBV polymorphism and early changes in MDASI-Immunotherapy symptom items are pre-
dictive of severe irAEs. To test our hypothesis, we will evaluate 500 patients on treatment with ICPis at MD
Anderson or the National Cancer Institute. In Aim 1, we will perform long-amplicon TCRB repertoire sequenc-
ing of RNA extracted from baseline peripheral blood samples to predict risk of severe irAEs based on TRBV
polymorphism. In Aim 2, we will longitudinally administer patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures to deter-
mine symptom, function, and health status changes that predict the risk of severe irAEs. Finally, in Aim 3, com-
bining TRBV polymorphism and PRO changes with relevant demographic, socioeconomic, treatment, and clini-
cal factors, we will build a predictive model and validate the model in an independent cohort of patients. To
translate our results into clinical practice, we will also develop a web-based application to predict the risk of
severe irAEs during treatment with ICPis. Our contribution is significant since risk assessment using the novel,
simple, web-based tool will enable patients and their treating physicians to formulate personalized irAE-
monitoring care plans to mitigate irAEs. This multidisciplinary approach will facilitate early detection and prompt
management of irAEs, which will reduce the chance of progression to life-threatening or fatal events."
10801116,"Project Summary/Abstract
Conventional thresholds of physiological parameters for clinical diagnosis have become a root cause of
racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare. These thresholds were established decades ago using limited samples of
Caucasian subjects and simplistic statistics without considering genetic effects. Consequently, these thresholds
have no capacity to account for the normal variability intrinsic in race/ethnicity, genes, and environments, which
can lead to errors in disease diagnosis and risk assessment when applied to racial/ethnic minorities. As the
minority population grows and becomes even more diverse, continuing to use Caucasian-based, “one-size-fits-
all” thresholds creates the risk of exacerbating racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare. Therefore, an effective
alternative must be developed to address this issue. Hence, we propose creating Person-specific Precision
Thresholds (PPTs), which are designed to account for normal variability in genetic and biological makeup,
variation in race/ethnicity, sex, age, and other characteristics. PPTs will eliminate the root cause of healthcare
disparities caused by conventional thresholds for diagnosis and risk assessment. The innovative precision of
PPTs will fundamentally shift current research paradigms regarding clinical thresholds from a single cutoff point
for everyone to precise, person-specific thresholds matched to individual genetics and phenotypic
characteristics. PPTs will effectively improve disease diagnosis and risk assessment while reducing healthcare
disparities. The first PPT iteration will focus on women's bone mineral density (BMD), as osteoporosis primarily
affects women the most. The existing T-score threshold of BMD has become controversial because many women
who sustain fragility fractures have a “normal” BMD value, as defined by the commonly employed T-score
method. Because genetic factors contribute to 50-85% of BMD variation, genetic variants must be considered
when creating precision thresholds. With feasibility tested by pilot studies, we hypothesize that PPTs will enhance
the ability of a single BMD measure to predict fractures in minority women compared to conventional T-score
and prior model-based methods, which lack consideration of genetics. We will pursue the following three specific
aims: (1) Develop a modeling framework for PPTs of BMD using novel machine-learning techniques; (2) Calibrate
PPTs of BMD using clinical data; (3) Validate the PPTs of BMD using genomic cohort data. In addition, we will
create a publicly available, cloud-enabled PPT application for community investigators. This proposed approach
is innovative because it integrates individual genetics into clinical precision thresholds and uses novel machine-
learning techniques to create PPTs. By replacing the traditional one-size-fits-all threshold, the innovative PPTs
will shift existing research paradigms regarding how clinical thresholds have been developed and implemented.
The knowledge gained from this research can be utilized to create many other PPTs to improve the diagnosis
and prevention of various diseases and illnesses. These next-generation PPTs will help significantly improve
patient outcomes, leading to better health, a higher quality of life, and improved health equity."

In response to PAR-22-072: Measures and Methods to Advance Research on Minority Health and Health
Disparities-Related Constructs, this project “Smoking and Cancer-Related Health Disparities among
Sexual and Gender Minority Adults” proposes to integrate multiple independent national data sets to
estimate the prevalence of smoking behaviors, low dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening
eligibility and use, and other smoking-related outcomes among sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI)
minority (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) adults. While a growing body of literature documents large
disparities in tobacco use for SOGI minority populations, past research focusing on SOGI minority adults to
determine smoking-related health disparities has been severely hampered by geography and by inadequate
sample sizes, particularly to examine heterogeneity within SOGI minority subgroups. Thus, there is a lack of
research that examines the prevalence and unique risk factors (i.e., state-level SOGI-specific policies)
associated with cigarette smoking, LDCT lung cancer screening, and smoking-related health outcomes among
SOGI minority adults using nationally representative data. The absence of adequate explanatory frameworks
further hinders the ability to effectively screen, prevent, or treat lung cancer-related health behaviors in at-risk
populations such as SOGI minority adults. The overall five-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 17-19%,
but survival substantially improves with early detection. To this end, the proposed project will integrate four
national data sets that include adults aged 18 years and older in the U.S. The integration of these data sets,
which have common measures of SOGI, cigarette use, and smoking-related health outcomes, will provide
adequate sample sizes to examine the prevalence and risk factors of smoking behaviors that cannot be
adequately addressed with one data set alone. This study aims to: (1) evaluate alternative state-of-the-art
techniques for combining estimates from four different surveys with a specific focus on SOGI minority
populations and cigarette use, smoking-related health outcomes, and LDCT eligibility and use; (2) using the
harmonized data based on the four different surveys, assess the self-reported cigarette use, smoking pack-
years, smoking-related health outcomes, and eligibility and use of LDCT lung cancer screening among adults
by sexual orientation (SO) and gender identity (GI); and (3) examine how state-level policy enactment and
implementation related to SO and GI are associated with smoking, LDCT lung screening eligibility and use,
and smoking-related health outcomes, while controlling for the state-level tobacco environment. We will
capitalize on the unique opportunities afforded by the integration of these data sets: large samples of SOGI
minorities; heterosexual and cisgender comparison groups; innovative methodological approaches for
combining estimates; and multilevel analyses with state-level policies related to SO and GI."
10803973,"The treatment of cancer has been revolutionized by the development of targeted and immune-based therapies.
However, many of these new therapies, as well as established ones such as doxorubicin, can damage the heart
and cause severe heart failure. A growing body of evidence suggests that perturbations in cardiomyocyte
autophagy may play a central role in chemotherapy-induced heart failure, and the ability to image this process
in vivo could provide important insights. We have recently developed an autophagy-detecting nanoparticle (ADN)
and have used this agent to image autophagy in the heart during chemotherapy with doxorubicin and dasatanib.
The core of the agent consists of ferumoxytol, an MRI-detectable nanoparticle, to which several polyarginine-
Cy5.5 moieties are attached. The polyarginine peptides facilitate the translocation of the agent into the cell,
where it is taken up by autophagosomes and trafficked to the lysosomes. Folding of the polyarginine peptides
also results in stacking and quenching of the Cy5.5 fluorochromes until the peptides are cleaved by cathepsins
in the autophagolysosomes. We have shown using chemical inhibitors/stimulators of autophagy, and cells with
genetic deletion of the key autophagy proteins ATG5 and ATG7, that the activation of ADN is specific for
autophagy. Likewise, using a transgenic mouse with overexpression of the DDiT4L transcription factor in the
heart and the canonical autophagy model of intermittent fasting, we have shown that ADN can detect autophagy
in vivo with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. In this proposal we will use ADN to interrogate changes
in autophagy in both the heart and cancer. While the upregulation of autophagy in the heart is protective, it has
the potential to either protect or harm tumors undergoing chemotherapy. We hypothesize that the imaging of
autophagy with ADN will allow conditions and strategies to be identified where the upregulation of autophagy is
cardioprotective but does not attenuate the effect of the chemotherapy on the tumor. In aim 1 of the proposal,
we will make a small chemical modification to the probe, enabling it to be detected before and after its activation,
and use confocal/super-resolution microscopy of live cells to develop a detailed kinetic model of autophagy.
IPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and relevant tumor cell lines will be studied. In aim 2 we will assess the impact of
autophagy upregulation on a library of tumor cell lines exposed to a large panel of chemotherapies, many known
to cause heart failure. In aim 3 we will use a multispectral fluorescence approach to image autophagy, apoptosis
and inflammation in the heart and in tumors in mice in vivo. The impact of autophagy upregulation will be
assessed and a detailed kinetic model of autophagy in the heart and in tumors will be derived. Execution of the
proposed aims will provide important insights into the role of autophagy in the heart and cancer, and provide a
platform to identify safe and effective autophagy regulating strategies to protect the heart during chemotherapy."
10803985,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are prevalent cardiovascular
syndromes of aging that frequently co-exist. Unfortunately, clinical outcomes are worse among individuals with
comorbid HFpEF and AF compared with either syndrome in isolation. Although AF and HFpEF share several
common clinical risk factors, such risk factors lack the pathway-specific granularity that is essential toward
identifying therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment. Over the last 6 years, our group has identified
reduced left atrial (LA) mechanics as a shared upstream phenotype that predates both AF and HFpEF. Recently,
we have demonstrated that LA functional reserve (i.e., change in LA function after intravascular volume
challenge) is uniquely linked to subclinical HFpEF syndromes. Despite consistent associations between LA
dysfunction and cardiometabolic risk factors, how these risk factors promote LA dysfunction remains elusive.
The advent of high-throughput circulating metabolite profiling and protein quantification has presented a unique
opportunity to define metabolic pathways driving LA dysfunction to illuminate its pathobiology. We have
previously defined a distinct proteomic signature of LA dysfunction in prevalent HFpEF. Similarly, select
metabolites have been associated with LA dysfunction, AF, and HFpEF. Despite these early findings, several
questions remain: 1) are these molecular biomarkers of LA dysfunction simply a consequence of prevalent
AF/HFpEF?; 2) what is the proteomic and metabolomic signature of sensitive measures of LA function at rest
and after hemodynamic provocation?; and 3) do these associations exist in ethnically diverse populations at high
joint AF and HFpEF risk? The overall goal of the proposal is to elucidate key metabolic pathways linked to LA
dysfunction to determine the shared biology of AF and HFpEF among individuals at risk. Our study will leverage
multimodality measures of LA function at rest and after hemodynamic provocation in participants of the Multi-
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). In Aim 1, we will determine proteomic associations of LA dysfunction,
incident AF, and incident HFpEF using targeted and untargeted approaches. We will validate our findings in the
Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA), and the HeartShare study. In Aim 2, we will determine the
metabolomic signature of LA dysfunction and its association with incident AF and HFpEF in MESA, and validate
findings in CARDIA, Framingham Heart Study (FHS), a cohort of hospitalized patients who have undergone
cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and the HeartShare study. In Aim 3, we will perform integrative analyses of
the metabolome and proteome and its relationship with LA dysfunction, incident AF, and HFpEF. We will
determine associations of genetic variation of the most highly loaded proteins and metabolites within each
network with LA dysfunction, AF, and HFpEF. Upon completion, this proposal will provide foundational insights
into the pathogenesis of LA dysfunction, an upstream phenotype of the AF-HFpEF syndrome."
10804039,"Disseminating Effective Sexual Health Programs in Schools using iCHAMPSS
 PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite a steady decline in the U.S., teen births continue to be a public health problem, particularly in Texas. Texas has
the ninth-highest teen birth rate and is tied for the highest percentages of repeat teen births nationally. Teen births are
especially problematic in South Texas, with rates as high as 64 per 1,000 females 15-19 years. Sexual health evidence-
based programs (EBPs) can reduce sexual behaviors that increase the risk of unintended pregnancies and other adverse
sexual health outcomes among youth; however, the implementation of such programs has been limited in schools. In
fact, fewer teens now than in the past receive any sexual health information in Texas schools. Thus, there is a critical
need for evidence-based strategies to increase the adoption and implementation of sexual health EBPs in Texas schools.
Our goal is to increase the adoption and implementation of sexual health EBPs in South Texas schools; in doing so, we
will reduce risky sexual behaviors among adolescents and, ultimately, teen births. The objective of this 5-year study,
which is the next logical step to attain our goal, is to rigorously evaluate iCHAMPSS 2.0 (CHoosing And Maintaining
Effective Programs for Sex Education in Schools). We designed this innovative, theory-based implementation strategy to
increase knowledge and skills among school-based and district-wide decision-makers, enabling effective adoption,
implementation, and maintenance of sexual health EBPs. Our central hypothesis is that iCHAMPSS 2.0 will increase the
implementation of sexual health EBPs in South Texas schools in the implementation phase relative to the control phase.
Our rationale for this project is that determining iCHAMPSS 2.0's effectiveness will help scale-up sexual health EBPs
across Texas schools, giving access to critical sexual health information to thousands of Texas youth annually. This study
is founded on our extensive experience working with Texas school districts to implement sexual health EBPs and
developing and pilot-testing iCHAMPSS 2.0 to disseminate these EBPs. Our proposed specific aims are to: (1) Conduct a
stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial of iCHAMPSS 2.0 in 15 South Texas school districts to test iCHAMPSS 2.0's
impact on the adoption, implementation, reach, and maintenance of sexual health EBPs in schools; (2) Determine
iCHAMPSS 2.0's effectiveness in improving determinants of sexual health EBPs use in schools based on constructs within
the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research; and (3) Conduct a process evaluation of iCHAMPSS 2.0
implementation to monitor implementation, reach, dosage, barriers, and facilitators to implementation. This study is
innovative because it seeks to test the effectiveness of the first-of-its-kind web-based implementation strategy designed
to overcome barriers to the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of sexual health EBPs, specifically in schools.
The proposed research is significant for its potential to meet the current demand from school districts and decrease the
teen birth rate in an area of high need by increasing the scale-up of sexual health EBPs in schools and advancing the
knowledge base of implementation research in the education sector."

Cryptosporidium is a wide-spread enteric pathogen that causes severe diarrheal disease in
immunocompromised patients and infants, especially in the developing world. There are more than 20
described species of Cryptosporidium some of which show narrow host ranges while others are quite broad. C.
parvum has a relatively broad host range infecting many agricultural animals and causing zoonotic infections in
humans. C. parvum is further divided into subtypes that undergo recombination in the wild often resulting in in
differences in host range, infectivity, and virulence. The factors that control host range of C. parvum as well as
their pathogenicity in different hosts are largely unknown, presenting a major gap in our understanding of this
important group of parasites. In preliminary studies, we have defined major virulence differences between
common laboratory variants of C. parvum during infection in immunocompromised mice. High-virulence
isolates are associated with elevated oocyst shedding and lethality, while low-virulence isolates cause only
mild, non-lethal infections. Whole genome sequencing identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms in
candidate genes that likely control these phenotypic differences. We recently developed a stem-cell derived
system for culturing differentiated intestinal enterocytes that allows complete development of C. parvum in
vitro, including production of viable oocysts. In preliminary studies, we tagged C. parvum isolates with
fluorescent reporters using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and used these lines to conduct genetic crosses in
vitro. Analysis of the recombinant progeny from crossed lines demonstrates that meiosis results in Mendelian
chromosome reassortment. In the proposed studies, we will cross fluorescently tagged virulent isolates with
avirulent isolates in vitro, sort recombinant progeny using FACS, and expand them in mice to select for genes
associated with increased fitness. The contributing loci will be mapped using Bulk Segregant Analysis to define
candidate genes that will be confirmed by CRISPR/Cas editing. These studies should lead to a molecular
understanding of pathogenicity of C. pavrum and may identify genes responsible for mediating infectivity and
host-range."

Endurance exercise is a highly effective intervention for ensuring healthy metabolism and maintaining healthy

sedentary animals. Here, we propose to identify genetic factors that mediate increased neuronal branching in
the exercising brain (Aim 1), elucidate the pathway regulating the response to octopamine in exercising muscle

some benefits of exercise in sedentary humans (Aim 3)."

Neural regulation of sleep, appetite and energy homeostasis is critical to an animal’s survival and under stringent
evolutionary pressure. Despite the prevalence of disorders associated with metabolism and sleep, the neural
and genetic processes that regulate interactions between these two systems is unclear. This proposal will
investigate how genes and neurons modulate sleep in response to changes in metabolism. Flies, like mammals,
potently modulate rest/activity cycles in accordance with their nutritional needs. Specifically, flies and mammals
suppress sleep in response to food deprivation, presumably to initiate food-seeking behavior. Powerful genetics
in the fruit fly allow for precise characterization of genes regulating behavioral and metabolic processes. We
recently identified a single pair of neurons that express the neuropeptide Leucokinin and are required for sleep-
metabolism interactions. This proposal will examine the neural signatures of food deprivation within these
neurons, and how they are regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic cues associated with feeding state. We will
combine single cell physiology and sequencing to define the molecular changes within these neurons associated
with sleep and food deprivation. Finally, we will examine how the peripheral adipose tissue communicates
energy stores to neurons in the brain that regulate sleep-metabolism interactions. Functional investigation of
genes regulating sleep-metabolism interactions will provide the groundwork for understanding metabolic
regulation of behavior and further our understanding of obesity, sleep disorders and diabetes."

The broad objective of the proposed research is to achieve comprehensive understanding of the effects of
DNA sequence variants on complex and quantitative traits in the yeast S. cerevisiae, arguably the most
powerful eukaryotic model system due to its small genome, ease of genetic manipulation, and the ability to
generate very large sample sizes. Evolutionary conservation has also ensured that many yeast traits have
direct parallels to biomedically important human phenotypes. We seek to comprehensively identify the DNA
loci and the candidate sequence variants within them that underlie genetic variation in fitness and expression
traits, experimentally engineer and test the effects of variants on a massive scale, and build rules for predicting
the functional effects of variants of unknown significance. Success in answering these questions will provide
critical guidance for the design of genotype-phenotype studies in humans and other organisms of medical,
biological, and agricultural interest, and enable improved diagnostic accuracy based on genome sequencing of
patients. Specifically, we will leverage single-cell sequencing to massively scale up genetic mapping in order to
increase statistical power and resolution of rare and common variant discovery. We will generate a mapping
population of millions of genetically diverse yeast by using CRISPR/Cas9 and other strain engineering tools to
facilitate crossing, selection of haploids, and incorporation of DNA barcodes. The mapping population will be
genotyped and phenotyped for both genome-wide transcript abundance and multiple fitness traits, to provide a
much richer sampling of the regulatory and other functional effects of natural yeast genetic variants, particularly
rare genetic variants. We will then employ a CRISPR/Cas9-based strategy to engineer variants in parallel on a
large scale and assess their effects in yeast through phenotypic assays. This approach involves designing
libraries of edit-directing plasmids that incorporate a specific variant at the target location. The phenotypic
assays rely on DNA barcoding and ultra-high-throughput sequencing. We will use statistical approaches to
analyze the data and control for errors and false discoveries. We also plan to validate the efficiency of the
system and improve the experimental design by evaluating the effects of various parameters. Finally, we will
build improved predictive models of variant effects in yeast, using large data sets generated here in
conjunction with existing yeast functional information. The focus will be on predicting the effects of coding and
non-coding variants on fitness traits, with machine learning and artificial intelligence models that incorporate
local sequence context, eQTL effects, and variant features such as allele frequency, functional scores, and
evolutionary conservation. The performance of the predictive model will be evaluated on newly engineered
variants, and the models will be improved through iterative cycles of feature selection, training, and
experimental testing."

The programmable CRISPR/Cas gene editing system has great potential for cancer treatment due to the ability
to precisely inactivate or repair cancer-related genes. However, delivery of CRISPR to solid tumors for efficient
cancer therapy remains limited by the uniquely stiff and fibrotic tumor microenvironment that acts as a barrier to
nanoparticle uptake. Here, we propose to directly target tumor tissue mechanics via a multiplexed lipid
nanoparticle (LNP) approach involving co-delivery of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) siRNA, Cas9 mRNA, and
sgRNA (siFAK + CRISPR LNPs) to enable tumor delivery and enhance gene editing efficacy. We will leverage
our recently developed non-viral Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) LNP platform that enables tissue-specific
nucleic acid delivery, protein delivery, and genome editing following intravenous (IV) administration. The
proposed approach involves a unique combination of siRNA-mediated gene silencing of FAK, a key modulator
of tumor ECM, and CRISPR-mediated gene editing (deletion) of tumor-related genes via a single all-in-one
nanoparticle approach. We will further leverage Liver and Lung SORT LNPs for to evaluate gene editing as a
strategy for permanent inactivation of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), supported by the clinical limitations
of anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). In this grant proposal, we Aim to (1) establish how FAK knockdown enhances SORT LNP-mediated
mRNA delivery and CRISPR gene editing, (2) optimize Liver and Lung SORT LNP formulations for multiplexed
siRNA + Cas9 mRNA + sgRNA delivery, and (3) evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Liver and Lung SORT siFAK
+ Cas9 mRNA + sgPD-L1 delivery in orthotopic and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer. Regulating
the mechanical properties of tumor cells/ECM for enhancing the genetic suppression in tumor tissues provides
an innovative strategy for treating cancer using CRISPR. We anticipate that this general approach could further
synergize with additional types of therapeutics in the future."

 Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) coincides with retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
heterogeneity. While ordered cellular heterogeneity is beneficial, pathogenic subgroups resulted
from age/stress-related heterogeneity could lead to age-related diseases. Aging and cigarette
smoking (CS) are the two strongest non-genetic factors associated with AMD risk. The
mechanisms whereby aging and CS drive RPE heterogeneity and these focal AMD changes are
unclear. RPE mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction is a well-established pathogenic factor in AMD, and
both aging and CS induce mt dysfunction. We recently reported that modest mt dysfunction
from impaired mitophagy can trigger reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated retrograde mt to
nuclear signaling and RPE epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which has been identified
in human AMD tissue. Senescence is a specific, terminal cellular program that induces cell
cycle arrest with aging, and/or metabolic and oxidative stress. Even small numbers of senescent
cells can drive age-related disease. We recently reported that mice deficient of mt phosphatase
PGAM5 had mt hyperfusion, which induced significant mt dysfunction associated with changes
in ROS and ATP level. As a result, a subset of RPE became senescent due to dysregulated
AMPK/mTOR signaling. Similarly, our pilot data show that RPE senescence and EMT can be
induced by non-lethal Cigarette Smoke Condensate (CSC). These observations suggest that mt
dysfunction severity from aging/CS can initiate RPE heterogeneity. Our objective is to
determine how aging and smoking induced mt dysfunction severity triggers RPE heterogeneity
including EMT and senescence, to link these phenotypes with RPE dysfunction and an AMD
phenotype in animal models, and identify the molecular identity of RPE heterogeneity including
EMT and senescence in a smoking model of AMD and human AMD samples. Our hypothesis
is that RPE mt dysfunction severity from smoking and aging induces RPE heterogeneity
including EMT, senescence, and cell death, which will be tested in two specific aims (SA). SA I
is to determine the extent that mt dysfunction severity from aging drives RPE
heterogeneity through regulating mt dynamics. SA II is to determine the extent that mt
dysfunction severity from smoking, especially when combined with aging, promotes RPE
heterogeneity and an AMD phenotype. By the end of proposed project, we will have
experimentally linked mt dysfunction severity with RPE EMT, senescence, and cell death, and
identified therapeutic targets to test for dry AMD, a long-term goal of our labs."
10805585,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the leading cause of chronic liver disease, and its incidence
and prevalence are expected to worsen with the growing aging population and epidemics of obesity and
metabolic syndrome. Unfortunately, NAFLD pathogenesis remains poorly understood and an effective
pharmacotherapy is lacking. Recent studies demonstrated that senescent hepatocytes accumulate in human
NAFLD and correlate with adverse outcomes. However, the characteristics of senescent hepatocyte have not
been defined, and it is unclear what molecular mechanisms drive/maintain this senescent phenotype or if/how
the senescent phenotype per se effects NAFLD progression. My preliminary data from NAFLD patients, rodent
NAFLD models and cultured senescent hepatocytes strongly suggest that hepatocyte senescence is involved in
NAFLD pathogenesis and drives NAFLD progression. I hypothesize that preventing accumulation of senescent
hepatocytes will improve NAFLD, and will test this hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1: Define the
transcriptome, secretome and paracrine effects of senescent hepatocytes. Aim 2: Dissect the molecular
mechanisms of hepatocyte senescence. Aim 3: Determine the role of hepatocyte senescence in NAFLD
pathogenesis/progression.
Overall, this project will evaluate a clinically relevant, innovative and impactful hypothesis by employing multiple
state-of-the-art approaches (i.e. CRISPR-based screening, bioactive chemical screening, genome editing, single
nuclei RNA-Seq, secretomics, etc) to comprehensively characterize the hepatocyte senescent phenotype,
uncover fundamental mechanisms that regulate senescence-associated liver biology (e.g. phenotypic
heterogeneity, metabolic reprogramming and state transitions) and identify novel senolytic therapies for NALFD.
Successful completion of this study will provide novel molecular mechanisms for NAFLD pathogenesis and thus,
establish the groundwork for future projects that exploit cellular senescence as a novel strategy to treat NAFLD
and other liver diseases. Together with the comprehensive career development plan outlined herein, this project
will advance my expertise in several areas, including cellular senescence, bioinformatics, secretomics, high-
throughput screenings and genome editing. A seasoned mentoring team with diverse and complementary
expertise, lengthy track records for training research scientists and full commitment for mentorship is established,
and will guide my career development by providing mentorship and research resources, and offering professional
scientific training during the award period. This award will provide me with superb professional and scientific
skillsets, enabling me to be a very competitive and worthy applicant for independent academic faculty positions

Gastrointestinal (GI) disease is a significant global problem, causing 3 million hospitalizations in the US alone.
Conventional antimicrobial treatment of GI infections present challenges such as selection of antibiotic resistance
and off-target interactions with commensal microbes. GI diseases are uniquely challenging to treat with protein-
based therapies because they often cannot withstand the harsh and rapidly changing environment of the GI
tract, which includes a rich collection of proteases. I hypothesize that an engineered probiotic, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae var. boulardii (Sb), can deliver anti-infective, protein-based therapies to the GI tract to treat the key
enteric pathogens Clostridioides difficile (Cd) and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF). Next-generation
therapies targeting Cd and ETBF, including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), toxin-neutralizing binding domains,
and anti-virulence proteins are in development and are amenable to Sb-based expression and secretion. Sb
maintains viability throughout the mammalian GI tract and can be modified with sophisticated genetic engineering
tools developed for the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Herein, I propose to expand upon a genetic
toolbox I have begun establishing to achieve finely tuned expression and secretion capacity from Sb in the con-
text of the mammalian GI environment and use this toolbox to modulate the expression of a panel of anti-infective
therapeutics targeted to either Cd or ETBF. I will thoroughly characterize a panel of Sb strains carrying these
therapies in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and impact on the host microbiome in the context of enteric infection.
The rationale for this proposal stems from i) the need for improved and controlled delivery strategies for anti-
infective protein therapies to treat GI infections, and ii) the extensive potential for Sb, which has inherent anti-
pathogen qualities, to be genetically modified for production and delivery of a large variety of therapeutic pay-
loads. My central motivation is to demonstrate the capacity for engineered Sb to eradicate the clinically significant
gut pathogens Cd and ETBF through therapeutic delivery systems that are both tunable and combinatorial. This
will be achieved through two aims: 1) define and expand the therapeutic capacity of Sb specifically in the mam-
malian gut environment by building a genetic toolbox of secretion constructs with varying secretion capacities of
a panel of anti-Cd and anti-ETBF therapies with distinct mechanisms of action, and 2) demonstrate that engi-
neered Sb is capable of selectively targeting the Cd and ETBF in murine models of infection. These experiments
are significant as they generate novel treatment regimens for enteric infections, including against Cd which has
significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, and for ETBF which has no clinically approved, targeted therapy
available. This proposal is innovative as it will develop Sb as a carrier of anti-Cd and anti-ETBF AMPs for the
first time and extensively define the impact of this therapeutic system on the host microbiota as well as the target
pathogen. Finally, this proposal is impactful as it strives to develop a safe, non-invasive, and targeted treatment
for major GI infections, and can be readily adapted to treat other maladies of the GI tract."

The goal of this K08 application is to provide a rigorous 5-year scientific and career development training plan
that will facilitate the transition of Dr. Glynnis Garry from a post-doctoral fellow to a fully independent investigator
as a cardiovascular physician-scientist. Dr. Garry obtained her medical degree from Vanderbilt University during
which she pursued a rigorous and productive 1.5 year molecular biology training through a Sarnoff
Cardiovascular Research Fellowship at UT Southwestern in the laboratory of Eric Olson, Ph.D, one of the world’s
leading experts in muscle biology and cardiovascular regeneration. After completing a short-tracked Internal
Medicine residency at UT Southwestern through the Physician-Scientist Training Program, Dr. Garry joined the
laboratory of Dr. Olson as a post-doctoral fellow, where she directed her focus to investigating direct cardiac
reprogramming as a means of promoting heart regeneration following myocardial infarction. Reprogramming of
fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes has emerged as an attractive strategy to redirect the fibrotic response of the
injured, non-regenerative heart toward a functional myocardium. However, previously discovered cocktails have
been ineffective in reprogramming adult human fibroblasts, limiting the clinical application of this strategy. From
a large unbiased screen, Dr. Garry identified the histone reader PHF7 as the most potent activator of adult
reprogramming. Her preliminary work demonstrated the ability of PHF7 to markedly activate reprogramming in
adult human and mouse fibroblasts by increasing chromatin accessibility at cardiac super enhancers when
added to a five-factor reprogramming cocktail. She also discovered the ability of PHF7 to activate adult murine
reprogramming in the absence of canonical reprogramming factors. Further, she recently generated data
demonstrating the ability of PHF7 to improve cardiac function following myocardial infarction, which is an
unprecedented result that merits further characterization. In her proposed research, Dr. Garry under the
mentorship of Dr. Olson will aim to 1) define the role of PHF7 in adult human reprogramming, 2) define the ability
of PHF7 and PHF7 cocktails to improve cardiac function following myocardial infarction, and 3) delineate
mechanisms by which PHF7 induces reprogramming events and improvement in cardiac function in vivo. These
studies will potentially provide the basis for development of a novel therapeutic factor for the treatment of
ischemic heart disease and advance our understanding of mechanisms that drive reprogramming. Dr. Olson is
a pioneer in the field of cardiac reprogramming with a storied legacy of mentorship. He is fully committed to
mentoring the career of Dr. Garry, and together they have assembled an outstanding advisory committee to
ensure her success through scientific mentorship, grantsmanship, coursework, and career development
opportunities. Given her outstanding mentorship, productive research program, and full institutional support and
resources of UT Southwestern, Dr. Garry is well-positioned to launch a successful career as an independent
leading academic cardiovascular physician-scientist and submits a K08 award application to this end."
10930896,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Candidate: My long-term goals are to acquire a tenure-track faculty position at a research-intensive university
that serves students who reflect the diversity of the United States. My research will utilize multi-modal
neuroimaging techniques to better understand the neural correlates and developmental relationship between
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use in women and racial/ethnic minority groups. I have a strong
background in using structural and functional neuroimaging techniques to study the threat-related neurocircuitry
related to the development and maintenance of PTSD. In this application, I propose to extend my training by first
learning the basic neural mechanisms that promote alcohol use and how trauma exposure may contribute to
neurological vulnerabilities in women, making this group more prone to using alcohol. Furthermore, I will build
off the training I am already receiving through my Diversity Supplement award to learn how to use complex
longitudinal statistical models to analyze ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data. Ultimately, this
additional training will give me the skills to produce high-impact publications and successful R01 submissions.
Training: In addition to Dr. Jennifer Stevens, I have a mentoring team filled with experts in academic research
who will provide the necessary training and guidance to accomplish this proposal. Dr. Julie Kable is an Associate
Professor of the Department of Psychiatry and Associate Director of the Emory Neurodevelopmental Exposure
Clinic, Dr. Justine Welsh is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Director of the Emory
Healthcare Addiction Services and Medical Director of the Addiction Alliance of Georgia, and Dr. Nicole Nugent
is an Associate Professor at Brown University. Outside of the mentoring team, we have identified workshops,
seminars, and meetings to provide further technical training, presentation experience, responsible conduct in
research, and the necessary skills (negotiations, tenure, laboratory management) to transition to independence.
Research: PTSD and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are highly co-occurring disorders (PTSD+AUD). Women are
twice as likely than men to develop PTSD, and women face more detrimental health effects from alcohol
compared to men. A large body of work has examined the neural mechanisms that underlie each disorder,
separately. However, very few studies have examined the neural substrates of co-occurring PTSD+AUD, and
none have examined sex differences. My preliminary data shows sex differences in the striatum, a region
important in reward-related behavior. This proposal aims to define sex differences in reward-related
neurocircuitry that contribute to alcohol use behaviors in trauma-exposed women. By using EMA and
functional neuroimaging techniques, I anticipate expanding our understanding of sex differences in reward-
related neurocircuitry that promote alcohol use in trauma-exposed populations. The successful completion of
this proposed project has the potential to inform the development of preventative interventions to inhibit the
development of AUD in trauma-exposed women."
10786002,"Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is a slow-growing disease with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 9%. It is the fourth
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US. Currently used pancreatic cancer drugs are not very
effective and exhibit severe side effects. Patients develop drug resistance and ultimately cancer relapse due to
the generation of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which play significant roles in tumor initiation, promotion,
metastasis, and chemotherapy failure. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new non-toxic drugs to
improve pancreatic cancer patients’ outcomes. Special AT-rich binding protein 2 (SATB2) is a nuclear matrix
protein that acts as a key regulator of gene expression and chromatin remodeling. SATB2 is highly expressed
in pancreatic cancer cells and CSCs, but not in human pancreatic normal ductal epithelial cells. Nanog, a
transcription factor, is highly expressed in mouse and human pluripotent stem cells. Nanog overexpression
has been detected in cancer and CSCs, and is correlated with cell proliferation, tumor recurrence, clonogenic
development, tumorigenicity, invasiveness, and resistance to chemotherapy. STAB2 plays a significant role in
the pluripotency and self-renewal of stem cells and inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth. SATB2 regulates
the expression of pluripotency maintaining and self-renewal factors (Oct-4, Sox-2, Nanog, cMyc, and KLF4).
Furthermore, overexpression of the SATB2 gene induces malignant transformation, and inhibition of SATB2
expression by shRNA inhibits pancreatic cancer growth; suggesting the oncogenic role of SATB2 in pancreatic
cancer. Unfortunately, there are no small organic molecule-based FDA-approved SATB2 inhibitors in the
market. The main objective of this application is to identify and validate SATB2 inhibitors for the treatment of
pancreatic cancer using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and in vitro cell culture
approaches. Our hypothesis is that the SATB2 inhibitor suppresses pancreatic cancer growth by inhibiting
Nanog expression. Aim 1. To perform molecular screening and docking studies to find selective SATB2
inhibitors. Aim 2. To examine the molecular mechanisms by which SATB2 inhibitors suppress human
pancreatic cancer growth in vitro. Molecular docking studies, molecular dynamics simulations, and QikProp
analysis will be performed to identify non-toxic and drug-like selective SATB2 inhibitors. Biding residues of
SATB2 which interact with specific compounds (SATB2 inhibitors, small organic molecules) will also be
identified. The effects of SATB2 inhibitors on binding to SATB2 proteins, Nanog transcription, cell viability,
apoptosis, spheroid and colony formation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) will be examined. The
effects of SATB2 inhibitors on the expression of pluripotency and self-renewal genes (Oct-4, Sox-2, KLF-4,
cMyc, and Nanog), and stem cell markers (CD24, CD44, and CD133) will be measured by qRT-PCR and/or
western blot analysis. SATB2 binding partners/targets will be identified by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
Sequencing (ChIP-seq). In conclusion, our studies are highly innovative and offer significant preclinical
benefits by developing non-toxic SATB2 inhibitors for the treatment of pancreatic cancer."
10804993,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a potentially curative therapy
for hematologic malignancies and other diseases, in which the donor's stem cells are
used to replace the recipient's damaged or destroyed cells. The Veterans Health
Administration has been offering allo-HCT services since 1982, which have saved
thousands of veterans' lives. However, this life-saving therapy comes at a cost - lethal
immune activation caused by cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Currently,
glucocorticoids (GC) and IL-6 antagonists are used for CRS treatment, but some
patients do not respond well to treatment. A limitation is that CRS may cause
irreversible organ injury before treatment is initiated, as the indicator of treatment is
CRS itself. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify patients at high risk of CRS
and provide preventive therapy.
 We recently reported that the adrenal stress response, defined by a 6-fold
increase in induced GC (iGC) production, is an essential host response against therapy-
induced lethal immune activation. We identified scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), an HDL
receptor, as a key regulator for iGC production. Using SR-BI null mice as an adrenal
stress response deficiency model, we demonstrated that the adrenal stress response
protects against therapy-induced death by controlling CRS. Conversely, relative adrenal
insufficiency (RAI) - the absence of adrenal stress response - is a risk factor for CRS.
Our study provides proof-of-concept that diagnosing RAI may help identify patients at
risk of CRS, and selective GC therapy for patients with RAI prior to the onset of CRS
may reduce mortality from therapy-induced lethal immune activation. The goal of this
application is to delineate the mechanisms of the adrenal stress response protection
against CRS in allo-HCT-induced lethal immune activation and to translate the
mechanistic findings into a precision medicine approach to prevent CRS in allo-HCT-
induced lethal immune activation.

10805957,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global epidemic, progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) and fibrosis, and results in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and increased cardiovascular
mortality. NAFLD affects greater than 30% of the general US adult population, and disturbingly, prevalence
rates appear to be greater in the military and veteran population. Unfortunately, no pharmacological therapies
are available yet to treat NASH and fibrosis, necessitating the identification of novel targets and approaches.
We have recently reported that hepatic eNOS is reduced in human patients with increasing NASH severity,
and in vivo deletion of eNOS in hepatocytes exacerbated hepatic steatosis and NASH susceptibility. Here we
present novel preliminary data demonstrating that eNOS deletion in hepatocytes upregulates the lipogenic
transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and the DNL regulatory proteins
acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). In addition, both hepatocyte-specific eNOS
overexpression suppressed markers of DNL, concurrent with decreased histological steatosis and
inflammation. These results clearly show in hepatocytes that eNOS depletion is deleterious for liver disease. In
contrast, we have recently made the novel preliminary observation that silencing eNOS specifically in Kupffer
cells (KCs) in vitro and in vivo dramatically suppressed KC pro-inflammatory activation status and reduced
short-term western diet induced NASH. Similarly, silencing eNOS in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in vitro
reduced HSC fibrogenic activation. Whereas overexpressing eNOS in KCs and HSCs increased pro-
inflammatory cytokine expression and increased HSC activation. Collectively, these data indicate that there is
an apparent dichotomy in eNOS function in hepatocytes vs. nonparenchymal cells. Therefore, we hypothesize
that hepatocyte-specific eNOS deletion transcriptionally upregulates DNL and SREBP1c and drives NAFLD
(Aim 1), while KC- and HSC- specific eNOS deletion attenuates NASH and fibrosis (Aim 2). We will
mechanistically interrogate both of these aims using gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in vivo and in
vitro to target eNOS in hepatocytes, KCs and HSCs. These studies will establish the cell type specific
importance of eNOS and provide valuable insight into reducing the incidence of NAFLD and NASH in our
Veteran population."

A growing share of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) rather than traditional fee-
for-service (TM) Medicare, with the MA share increasing from 13% in 2004 to 39% in 2020. The Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) pay MA plans a monthly capitated rate to cover nearly all health care
expenses for plan enrollees. MA plans keep as profits the portion of payments that are not used to cover enrollee
expenses. In addition, CMS grants MA plans greater freedom to manage enrollees’ health care use, for example,
through tools such as narrow provider networks and broader coverage of delivery innovations such as
telemedicine. Proponents argue that these financial incentives and effective tools for MA plans might enable
them to provide care more efficiently than TM. On the other hand, these effects could be offset by financial
incentives under capitation to limit service provision beyond what is necessary to improve short term health,
resulting in adverse impacts on longer-term outcomes. Prior work has primarily estimated cross-sectional
comparisons of TM and MA enrollees, which could lead to biased estimates if MA enrollees differ from TM
enrollees in other ways that are related to health care use and health outcomes. Our proposed project will study
changes in MA enrollment coming from seven states that recently changed public retiree health benefits from
supplemental TM coverage to mandatory MA plans (or in one state, from a mandatory MA plan to supplemental
TM coverage). We will use these natural experiments, along with comprehensive Medicare data for TM and MA
enrollees, to estimate the causal impact of MA enrollment on health care use, quality, and patient outcomes.
These results will provide important evidence to policymakers weighing broader expansions of Medicare
Advantage."

Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in individuals over 55 years of age
and is increasing as the world population becomes older. Treatment options for early AMD are limited and,
therefore, vision will become increasingly threatened in the elderly population. Evidence from observational
studies suggest that whole foods, Mediterranean diets and low glycemic load (LG) diets are associated with
less progression of AMD, suggesting a cost-effective approach to slow AMD progression. The goal of this
project is to assess feasibility aims for dietary intervention in a non-diabetic AMD cohort with early stage
disease and to plan a future large, multicenter study that will compare LG-Mediterranean dietary intervention to
standard diet. Our aims are to: 1) demonstrate feasibility of behavioral intervention to change dietary intake in
subjects with intermediate AMD from consuming a typical Western diet to a LG, Mediterranean diet; 2) assess
the feasibility of obtaining sensitive retinal images and sdOCTs and to explore assays (metabolomic markers,
complement factors, gut barrier dysfunction and dysbiosis, AGEs, and oxycholesterols (e.g. 7-ketocholesterol)
for consideration as non-disease biomarkers for a future UG1; 3) develop a protocol for a future multicenter
study and a Manual of Procedures. Our team is cross-disciplinary including experts in behavioral dietary
intervention, endocrinologists, retinal specialists, clinical trial experts and leaders of large consortia of AMD
intervention studies in the US and Europe. Innovative aspects of the planning study include: to assess the
willingness of an elderly population without diabetes to adopt a dietary intervention; to use continuous glucose
monitoring as a coaching tool for the cohort and to learn about the sensitivity of continuous glucose monitoring
for the future multicenter study; to explore ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic biomarkers for the future
study; and to perform feasibility studies on systemic biomarkers relevant to the pathophysiology of AMD and
that may improve sensitivity of outcome measures in the future multicenter clinical trial."

Deaf children who reach the age of eight without a foundation in language have longitudinal struggles in the
areas of receptive and expressive language, working memory, executive functions, literacy and academic
skills, and behavioral, mental, social, and physical health. The lack of intervention programs targeting sign
language competencies during the critical period of development is a critical barrier to making progress in
preventing or addressing language delays in deaf children. Strategic and interactive approaches driven by
sociocultural, cognitive, and language theories have accumulated a large body of evidence documenting
improvements in more complex oral and written language skills. Cross-linguistic transfers between oral and
writing skills within and across first and second languages are well-established in the literature. Taking these
factors into account in addition to growing evidence that sign language skills positively predict literacy skills
and may lead to improved health outcomes, it is critical to systematically support deaf children’s sign language
competences as early as possible. To address the identified critical barrier to progress, these are the aims of
this project: (1) develop Strategic and Interactive Signing Instruction (SISI), an intervention program to target
the development of sign language skills in deaf children aged 5-8; (2) refine SISI training and implementation
protocols; and (3) test the efficacy of SISI in improving deaf children’s sign language skills. First, a SISI manual
will be developed for standardization and consistency in training, implementation, and fidelity. The SISI manual
will include: (a) descriptions of strategic and interactive approaches and their new applications to develop sign
language skills, (b) SISI intervention protocols, (c) SISI fidelity checklist, and (d) list of sign language skills that
are targeted in SISI. Second, an experimental study will be conducted to assess the extent of training and
support required from teachers to become proficient in SISI implementation. Meanwhile, child progress in
meeting their target sign language skills will be monitored formatively, and modifications may be made in an
iterative design fashion to strengthen the intervention design. Third, another experimental study will be applied
to assess the efficacy of SISI in improving deaf children’s sign language skills. Findings will provide robust data
on the mechanisms of successful training dose, intervention design and fidelity, and data collection protocols in
preparation for subsequent R01 application involving a large randomized controlled trial with sufficient
statistical power to further strengthen evidence of SISI in improving deaf children’s sign language skills along
with examinations of cross-linguistic interactions in the written form. This project is innovative in its new
applications of theory-driven strategic and interactive approaches to target sign language development in deaf
children."
10796780,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Persistent post-viral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) is associated with a large spectrum of viruses with
significant adverse impacts on quality of life. The molecular and cellular changes in the olfactory epithelium in
cases of persistent PVOD have not been well characterized. Specifically, we are interested in studying the
response of the olfactory stem cells which are responsible for peripheral olfactory neurogenesis and the
regeneration of olfactory epithelium (OE) following injury. In the olfactory system, constitutive TNF-mediated
inflammation suppresses stem cell differentiation while elevated levels of IL-6 are correlated with persistent
olfactory loss. These findings raised the possibility that prolonged anti-viral signaling will inhibit olfactory stem
cell differentiation and thus impair OE regeneration and result in olfactory dysfunction. In our preliminary data,
we show evidence of increased type I and II interferon signaling in the olfactory mucosa of patients with SARS-
CoV-2 infection and elevated expression of interferon signaling genes in the olfactory stem cells of mice infected
with H1N1 influenza A. Furthermore, Notch signaling is known to be important in maintaining horizontal basal
cells (one of the olfactory stem cell populations) in an undifferentiated state. Thus, we hypothesize that persistent
PVOD may be related to an anti-viral olfactory epithelial response driven by the host innate immune system that
translates to a chronic upregulation of inflammatory signaling genes in the olfactory stem cells and an
upregulation of Notch signaling to result in stem cell quiescence and impaired regeneration of the olfactory
epithelium.
 In the proposed studies, we will investigate the chronic anti-viral and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways
in the local olfactory epithelial environment and olfactory stem cells through cytokine analysis and single cell
transcriptomic sequencing (Aim 1). We will correlate expression levels of these cytokines and interferon
stimulated genes with objective measures of olfactory function in humans with PVOD. Furthermore, we will
assess the effects of cytokines directly on cultured olfactory stem cells in vitro. In Aim 2, we will assess the
impact of viral infection on the Notch signaling pathway in olfactory stem cells using individual cell fate mapping
with quantitative immunostaining and single cell transcriptomic sequencing. In vivo testing of Notch antagonists
using a mouse model of viral infection will help determine the reversibility of the viral impact and the efficacy of
therapeutic targeting of the Notch pathway. The incorporation of both mouse and human models in this study
will allow for precise genetic manipulation and functional testing to assess olfactory epithelial cell fate as well as
permit direct translation of post-viral changes in gene expression on clinical outcomes of olfaction. Together,
these studies will help elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms for persistent post-viral olfactory loss
that may shed light on potential pathways for future therapeutics."

10796826,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Centrioles are required to template cilia and flagella and to organize centrosomes that nucleate
cytoplasmic microtubules in interphase and dividing cells. Centrosomes lose their ability to organise
cytoplasmic microtubules when they become basal bodies, which can template the formation of
primary cilia for signalling or flagellae for propelling sperm. To understand these diverse roles, it
necessary to study centrioles in the development of different cell types. Yet, their replication, structure
and function has been largely studied in cultured cells. Here we take advantage of the genetic and
developmental advantages of Drosophila to study centriole function in two cell types; cells destined to
make neurosensory cilia in the leg imaginal disc and male germ line cells destined to generate sperm.
 Our focus is on the roles of a network of centriole proteins in which Ana3, counterpart of human
ROTATIN and Rcd4, PPP1R35 in human cells, interact with each other and with a set of proteins
required for various steps of the elongation and maturation of the centriole necessary for it to become
a basal body. Specifically, we will: (i) apply molecular and structural biology approaches to determine
how the Ana3 and Rcd4 proteins interact with each other and with other centriole proteins to specify
different aspects of centriole assembly and function and how this is regulated by phosphorylation. We
will test the functions of these interactions through directed mutagenesis. (ii) use genetic approaches
to determine inter-dependencies of the networks that regulate centriole elongation in the conventional
cell division cycles of cultured cells and the leg imaginal disc and in cells that develop neurosensory
cilia. (iii) determine the differential roles of Rcd4 and Ana3 and their interacting network of proteins in
the multiple steps leading to formation of the giant centrioles of spermatocytes and their sequential
roles in generating primary cilia and subsequently sperm flagellae.,
 Because centriole duplication pathways are highly conserved between Drosophila and man, our findings
will shed light onto a wide range of human diseases including cancer, where centrosome defects indicate
poor prognosis; heritable ciliopathies, which affect centrioles and cilia in a wide range of tissues; and in
microcephaly, where defects in proteins such as ROTATIN, whose counterpart we study here, lead to
abnormal brain development."

This K24 Career Development Award in Patient-Oriented Research seeks support for a well-established, mid-
career Professor in Psychiatry at Yale who has a track record of achievement in patient-oriented alcohol
research, and a long-standing commitment to mentorship. Dr. Cosgrove leads a research program devoted to
using brain imaging to elucidate brain mechanisms underlying the maintenance of and recovery from alcohol
use disorder (AUD) to inform clinical treatment. Through this award, she seeks support for career development
and training in new techniques and systems that will foster a comprehensive approach to AUD. Dr. Cosgrove
has a long history as a mentor and is committed to the development of new alcohol research scientists. Her
efforts in mentorship have recently increased as she assumed responsibility as Co-Director of the Translational
Alcohol Research Program (TARP), an NIAAA-funded T32 for postdoctoral fellows (PhDs and MDs).
The proposed mentoring plan will include continued and new mentoring of undergraduate and graduate
students, postdoctoral fellows (including as TARP Co-Director), and junior faculty. Additionally, she is a mentor
on two NIAAA-funded K01 Career Development Awards awarded to faculty at Yale. Dr. Cosgrove will provide
mentoring in study design, recruitment and characterization of participants with AUD, data collection, analysis,
and interpretation, manuscript and grant writing, research ethics, and career development. Dr. Cosgrove has a
strong commitment to mentoring students from diverse backgrounds. As part of her career development, she
will engage in training in diversity, equity, and inclusion to improve her mentorship skills in this area and to
conscientiously increase the diversity of alcohol researchers through recruitment for the TARP, Yale-
Specialized Center of Research Excellence (SCORE), and her research program.
Dr. Cosgrove’s overall research program has focused on the clinical neuroscience of AUD using state-of-the
art brain imaging techniques. The proposed career development plan consists of training and coursework in a
new technique (metabolomics), and organ system (liver) in order to promote a more comprehensive approach
to the study of AUD. The goal is to increase and expand proficiency in these areas that, in addition to expertise
in the neurochemistry of AUD, will allow her to be a more effective mentor and researcher across a range of
domains related to patient-oriented AUD research. The research plan is constructed around Dr. Cosgrove’s
primary project on the Yale-SCORE, which is broadly focused on sex differences in treatments for AUD. Her
project utilizes positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging to measure markers of neurodegeneration
and related neurocognitive function in people with AUD. Adding techniques to this project to measure
molecules and systems outside of the brain will provide a vehicle for the proposed training and mentorship

10797014,"Although in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, respiratory and digestive disease is the primary
source of morbidity and mortality there are many other clinically relevant symptoms such as
depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality, including sleep disturbances, and altered sleep
patterns. Sleep disturbances experienced by individuals with CF are consistent with circadian
rhythm (CR) phase delays. The clinical relevance of CR and sleep regulation in CF can be seen
in studies that demonstrate CF patients with poor sleep quality have more severe lung disease
and poorer outcomes over time. Whether CR disruption in CF is a direct effect of impaired CFTR
function or a secondary manifestation of disease progression is currently unclear. Also unclear is
the efficacy of modulatory therapy in CF in reversing these phenotypes. We have recently
published that CR gene expression is altered in a CF mouse model suggesting that CR
dysregulation is a primary manifestation of CF. Mechanistically, we have previously reported
alterations in microtubule regulation in CF cells. These findings lead to the hypothesis that CR
regulation in CF is altered due microtubule instability and consequent reductions in melatonin
production. Microtubules have been suggested to play an important role in CR, and we have
previously demonstrated that CF cells display reduced acetylation and slower microtubule
formation rates. We have also recently published that depletion of a microtubule modulating
protein (tubulin polymerization promoting protein, TPPP) from mice replicates CF-like CR
disruptions that support a role of microtubules in CF phenotypes. Preliminary data demonstrate
that CF mice produce reduced levels of melatonin, a key CR regulator and known regulator of
microtubule stability. These data suggest melatonin and/or microtubule targeted compounds as
possible therapeutic interventions that can augment modulator therapy or allow an alternative
approach to address CR-related phenotypes in CF patients. The goals of the study are to
determine the role of CFTR in CR regulation and if CFTR correction influences CR gene
expression and related behavioral outcomes. We also will strive to understand the cellular
mechanisms involved in these regulatory relationships that can be therapeutically targeted. To
achieve these goals, the following specific aims will be studied: Aim 1. To determine the CFTR-
dependency of CR regulation and the efficacy of highly-effective CFTR modulators in reversing
CF-related CR phenotypes. Aim 2. To identify mechanisms of CR dysregulation in CF. Aim 3.
To determine the effect of CFTR modulators on circadian rhythm and to determine melatonin
production in children and adolescents with CF."
10806473,"Project Summary/Abstract
Malignant primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors are incurable tumors characterized by high symptom
burden and poor survival. In addition to the symptoms and challenges common to patients with other advanced
cancers, patients diagnosed with malignant primary CNS tumors face unique stressors related to the effects of
the cancer on their nervous system. In an effort to cope with distress about their poor prognosis and neurological
dysfunction, these patients commonly engage in avoidant behavior that may ultimately heighten their distress
and lead to social isolation, with adverse effects on their mood and quality of life. This proposal details a five-
year plan to refine and pilot test a supportive psychosocial intervention that incorporates elements of Acceptance
and Commitment Therapy to address the unmet supportive care needs of patients with primary malignant CNS
tumors and alleviate their distress. Specifically, the aims of this projects are to 1) refine a population-specific
psychosocial intervention based on interviews with stakeholders (N=15) and an open pilot study (N=10),
incorporating adaptations for patients with cognitive or communication deficits, as are common among these
patients; and 2) perform a pilot randomized controlled trial (N=100) to evaluate the feasibility of the study protocol
and acceptability of the intervention, and estimate the preliminary effects of the intervention on intervention
targets (coping skills and values-driven behavior) and proposed outcomes (prognostic distress, mood, quality of
life and social isolation). This proposal also details the plans of the candidate, Dr. Deborah Forst, a neuro-
oncologist and outcomes researcher, to gain mentorship, didactic training and career development to facilitate
her transition to research independence. Dr. Forst’s long-term career goal is to become an independent
physician-investigator and leader in supportive care research in neuro-oncology. With this project, Dr. Forst will
gain essential experience and skills in 1) developing psychosocial interventions; 2) adapting supportive care to
accommodate the needs of patients with cognitive and communication deficits; and 3) conducting supportive
care trials in seriously ill patients. She will receive this training through a combination of expert mentorship,
coursework and conference participation, and the design and execution of the proposed project. Dr. Forst has
assembled a team of mentors who are experts in designing and conducting supportive care trials (Dr. Jennifer
Temel, primary mentor) and refining psychosocial interventions (Dr. Lara Traeger, co-mentor), and she will
receive additional guidance and support from scientific advisors with expertise in cognitive dysfunction in patients
with CNS tumors, cognitive-linguistic rehabilitation, neuro-oncology trials, and biostatistics. Dr. Forst’s training
will be supplemented by structured coursework and participation in pertinent workshops and conferences. This
K08 award will prepare Dr. Forst to become an independent R01-funded investigator and leader in supportive
care in neuro-oncology, focused on the development of novel evidence-based psychosocial interventions to
improve outcomes for patients with malignant primary CNS tumors and other vulnerable cancer populations."
10936532,"Enhancing American Indian Caregiver Mastery through a Savvy Caregiver Program-Peer addresses the
growing number of American Indian caregivers with limited knowledge of dementia. The high level of burden
associated with providing care for those with dementia, along with uncertainty about managing disease
conditions, problems with different psychosocial aspects of care, lack of culturally responsive training and
education materials results in caregivers reporting feelings of isolation and depression. Despite the unique needs
of American Indian caregivers, few resources support this group in a culturally appropriate way. The Savvy
Caregiver Program is a multi-component, psychoeducational program consisting of 6 weekly 2-hour sessions for
family caregivers of people living with dementia at home. Informed by Stress Mediation and Social Cognitive
Theories, the Savvy Caregiver Program was developed to alleviate caregiving strains and strengthen knowledge,
skills, and outlook through classes, interactive exercises, and home assignments.
 This study will use a community-based participatory research framework to enhance the Savvy Caregiver
Program by adding a peer-based educational and support component, referred to as the Savvy Caregiver Peer
Program, that incorporates Stress Mediation and Generativity Theories. Six sequential talking circles will be held
with 5-8 previous American Indian dementia caregivers who are enrolled members of White Earth Nation (Aim
1) to develop the Savvy Caregiver Peer Program prototype. Participants will review the Savvy Caregiver Program
curriculum and discuss the roles and expectations of peer mentors in the program, including peer selection,
training, and a management structure to oversee peer mentors and caregiver engagement. The 6 planning and
design talking circles will gather strategic, culturally appropriate information to (1) provide the peer mentors with
an opportunity to directly define their role and expectations as part of the Savvy Caregiver Peer Program; (2)
educate peers on the Savvy Caregiver Program core elements and their role in supporting the materials; and (3)
gather insights about the peer mentor material to be provided to the caregiver. Upon completion of the sequential
talking circles and development of the Savvy Caregiver Program-Peer training materials and infrastructure, a
parallel arm randomized clinical trial of 30 caregivers (20 to intervention, 10 to control group) will be conducted
for 12 weeks (6 biweekly sessions) (Aim 2). Qualitative and quantitative data from peer mentors and caregivers
will be collected to assess the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment, randomization, intervention adherence,
and administration of caregiver measures. During Year 4 (Aim 3), we will host talking circles to engage caregivers
and peer mentors in the refinement and improvement of the Savvy Caregiver Program-Peer in preparation for
testing in a larger, subsequent randomized clinical trial. This study will contribute cultural and contextual
knowledge to inform the eventual development of caregiver interventions grounded in cultural values to improve
the quality of life and outcomes for American Indian dementia caregivers."

Extracellular proteolysis is a hallmark of cancer. Proteolysis has major functional consequences for
remodeling cell surface proteins and matrix including receptor activation and shedding of receptor
extracellular domains. Of the more than 600 human proteases, over half are on the cell surface or
secreted reflecting their significance for processing the extracellular space. Yet we understand very
little about the targets for cell surface proteolysis (CSP), the proteases responsible, and resulting neo-
cleaved products that could serve as new biomarkers or drug targets.
 What has been missing are robust technologies for unbiased identification of the CSP targets,
their specific sites of cleavage, the proteases responsible for promoting disease, and the generation of
neo-epitope specific antibodies. My group has engineered a novel peptide ligase, called subtiligase,
and shown it robustly labels sites of proteolysis of soluble proteins. Our preliminary data show that this
powerful tool can be used to determine the targets and precise sites of cleavage for CSP. We propose
this novel CSP technology can be used to determine CSP signatures in cancer. We will initially focus
on KRAS, the most dominant oncogene, especially in pancreatic cancer. We will determine KRAS-
induced proteolysis in isogenic pancreatic cell lines, with and without mutant KRAS, grown in hypoxic
and normoxic conditions in the context of two- and three-dimensional culture. We will identify the
surface proteases up-regulated using cell surface capture (CSC) proteomics and confirm their activities
using CRISPRi or small molecule inhibitors. We will characterize their specificities using new substrate
phage technology coupled with NGS and match these to neo-epitopes we discover. Lastly, we will
further exploit differential antibody phage display selection technology, and generate antibodies specific
to the cleaved forms of various identified targets, including CDCP1. We will develop important
technologies for new neo-epitope biomarkers and potential immune-oncology reagents for the
characterization of these important cleavage events.
 Impact: Our studies will provide robust protein engineering-based technologies for unbiased
insights into how CSP remodels cells, the proteases responsible, and actionable oncogene specific
neo-epitopes to generate antibodies as potential biomarkers and therapeutics. We believe these
approaches will be generally applicable to characterizing proteolysis in other solid tumor cancers."

The extent of a neuron’s dendritic arbor plays a critical role in the processing of sensory information in
mammalian neocortex. Dendrites grow rapidly after birth and then exhibit an apparent stability during
adolescence and adulthood resulting from a dynamic, homeostatic balance of opposing growth and retraction
pathways. Disruption of this balance could induce structural changes in previously formed dendritic arbors,
leading to deficits in cortical dendritic architecture which characterize several adolescent-onset neuropsychiatric
disorders. Many of the factors controlling dendritic growth and regression in adolescence remain unknown,
creating a critical gap in knowledge regarding both normal and abnormal adolescent dendritic development.
We recently identified that Oligodendrocyte Myelin Glycoprotein (OMGp) in can induce dendritic regression, via
a Kalirin-9 (KAL9) dependent mechanism. OMGp expression increases naturally across adolescence,
suggesting it contributes to the apparent dendritic stability in adolescence by counterbalancing growth signals.
In support of this interpretation, we observed that a gain of function (GOF) in OMGp signaling (ie KAL9-PT)
induces adolescent-onset dendritic regression in Layer 3 pyramidal cells (PCs) in primary auditory cortex in vivo.
In addition to the shape of its dendritic arbor, the extent of a PC’s output is determined through tight control of
dendritic postsynaptic integration by inhibitory somatostatin (SST) neurons. Inhibitory synapses from SST cells
targeting the dendrites of Layer 2/3 PCs in primary sensory cortex are highly dynamic even into adulthood, and
therefore may remain susceptible to adolescent-onset changes in dendritic architecture. This proposal seeks to
test the overall hypothesis that OMGp is a critical regulator of normal dendritic development in adolescence and
increased activity downstream of OMGp leads to dendritic regression with resultant functional impairments in
SST-dependent intracortical sensory processing. We will test this hypothesis in a set of integrated Aims. Aim 1
will induce oligodendrocyte- and neuronal-specific OMGp KO at timepoints spanning adolescence to examine
the role of cell-type specific OMGp in maintaining cortical dendritic architecture stability. Aim 2 will identify the
functional consequences of adolescent-onset dendritic regression on cortical signal processing, using a highly
translational auditory stimulation paradigm and chemicogenetic suppression to evaluate the impact on SST-
dependent (and as a comparator parvalbumin (PV)-dependent) cortical processing.
Completion of these studies will serve to increase basic knowledge of dendrite development and cortical
refinement during adolescence, and how OMGp influences these processes."

10806368,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths in the United States approached 1 million in 2019, accounting for 33% of
annual mortality. Americans consume 3,400 mg of sodium per day, nearly 50% higher than the limit
recommended by the U.S. FDA and WHO. Population sodium reduction is a strategy to reduce CVD deaths.
The WHO recommends four ‘best buys’ for sodium reduction: product reformulation, front-of-package labeling,
institutional procurement, and public educational campaigns. The FDA set a goal in 2016 to reduce sodium
consumption to 2,300 mg per day within ten years. Unfortunately, a lag exists in sodium policy implementation
in the U.S. An urgent need exists to apply implementation science to reduce excessive sodium consumption
to ultimately reduce CVD deaths. My research responds to this need by applying the RE-AIM framework to
policy implementation in systematically assessing sodium policy reach, effectiveness, adoption,
implementation, and maintenance. My preliminary studies in global CVD modeling and U.S. multisectoral
policy implementation serve as a critical foundation in formulating the overall objective for the proposed
research and in establishing study feasibility of carrying out this research. The rationale for this research is to
provide policy makers with the information and tools they need to improve cardiovascular health. This study will
analyze historical state-level data to estimate what ‘has been’ adopted, model to learn what ‘might be’ the
health gain and its distribution in nationwide implementation, and conduct qualitative study about what ‘could
be’ implemented. I analyze retrospective data on sodium policy adoption, maintenance, and reach in the
United States from 2000 to 2022 (Aim 1). I model how many lives might be saved by implementing institutional
procurement policy in all states in ten years (Aim 2). I assess capacity and constraints in multilevel
implementation system and stakeholder’s conventional and active roles in qualitative study (Aim 3). Outcomes
of this study include: (a) scientific evidence about current sodium policy implementation RE-AIM measures;
(b) an interactive tool, Policy RE-AIM, to present the findings from the three Aims in lay language and
through visualization; and (c) preliminary data to apply for future funding (e.g., an R01 award) to advance
CVD policy modeling methods and to improve sodium policy implementation at the county level. The proposed
research illustrates a novel application of RE-AIM to policy implementation science. It is innovative in
developing an interactive tool that can be used in the future as part of a strategy to improve policy
implementation to ultimately eliminate preventable cardiovascular health disparities. The intended impact of my
study is to contribute to the application of policy IS to CVD prevention and accelerate the translation of
cardiovascular science into real-world improvements in health equity. I have multidisciplinary mentorship with
expertise in implementation science (Dr. Bryan Weiner), policy implementation (Dr. Jodi Sandfort), modeling
(Dr. Yan Li), cardiovascular health (Dr. Chris Longenecker), as well as sodium and health (Dr. David Watkins)."
10915014,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This K01 award will provide training and protected research time for Alexandra Armstrong, DVM, DACVP, PhD
to achieve her career goal of becoming an independently-funded investigator with specialty expertise in animal
models of developmental orthopedic diseases, including the application of spatialomic profiling and quantitative
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (LCPD) is a developmental
orthopaedic disease with uncertainty regarding its pathogenesis or the ideal treatment regimen. Importantly, a
key aspect of the pathogenesis is ischemic injury to the growth cartilage in the proximal femur: both the
epiphyseal growth cartilage, underlying the articular surface, and the growth plate cartilage, within the femoral
neck. Dysfunction of these growth cartilages can contribute to collapse of the femoral head and to growth arrest
and leg length discrepancies, respectively. Despite the known role of ischemic injury to cartilage in LCPD, little
attention has been paid to the contribution of growth cartilage to either recovery or disease progression. To
address this critical gap, Dr. Armstrong will use a well-validated piglet model of LCPD to identify differentially
expressed genes within the growth cartilage associated with growth disturbances (Aim 1) and the response of
the growth plate and epiphyseal cartilage to transphyseal drilling (Aim 2), a treatment that may benefit children
with LCPD-induced growth disturbances. The patterns and pathways identified by spatialomics profiling will be
correlated with the histological features and compared to the quantitative MRI features of the epiphyseal
cartilage, with the potential to identify translational biomarkers of growth cartilage injury. Dr. Armstrong has a
strong scientific foundation, including expertise in musculoskeletal pathology, but she requires additional training
and dedicated time to develop her orthopaedic research program addressing questions of pathogenesis of
pediatric orthopaedic diseases using animal models. During the five-year training period, she will gain knowledge
in the clinical management of developmental orthopaedic disorders, develop expertise in novel spatialomics
methods and analysis, develop a strong knowledge base in cutting-edge musculoskeletal MRI techniques, gain
crucial experience in grantwriting, and undergo professional development in diversity, mentoring, teaching, and
leadership that will benefit her as a tenure-track faculty member with a primarily research-focused appointment.
This training will culminate in Dr. Armstrong achieving R01 or equivalent funding. She will be mentored by leading
experts in animal models, orthopaedic surgery, musculoskeletal imaging, rheumatology, and pathology, along
with didactic training in the analysis of genomic data, hands-on experiences, seminars/workshops, and
conferences. Dr. Armstrong’s work will be centered on the UMN Veterinary Clinical Sciences department, where
three of her four mentors are situated. Dr. Armstrong’s K01 training will fully prepare her to launch an independent
research career focused on improving the health of children affected by pediatric orthopaedic diseases."

The goals of this proposal are to help Sasha Prisco, MD, PhD, a cardiovascular physician-scientist, transition
to independence and to further the understanding of mechanisms of right ventricular dysfunction in pulmonary
arterial hypertension. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive vasculopathy which increases right
ventricular afterload, leading to right ventricular failure. Right ventricular function is the greatest predictor of
survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Unfortunately, there are no current pharmacologic therapies that
directly target the failing right ventricle. Our recent preclinical data demonstrated pathological inflammation
through activation of the cytokine receptor glycoprotein 130 induced deleterious microtubule remodeling,
downregulation of junctophilin-2 (an essential protein that maintains t-tubule structure and function), and
depressed right ventricular function in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Emerging data show alterations in gut
microbiota disrupt the intestinal barrier, which permits bacterial translocation, and subsequently activates
systemic inflammation, suggesting that modulating the microbiome may be an approach to mitigate
inflammation. We recently identified that modifying the gut microbiome with intermittent fasting improved right
ventricular function and postulate that increased abundance of Lactobacillus underlies these benefits. We will
test the hypothesis that Lactobacillus supplementation combats pathological gut dysbiosis, which prevents
immune cell activation, and subsequent glycoprotein 130-mediated microtubule remodeling in the following
specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine if Lactobacillus supplementation mitigates pathological microtubule
remodeling and enhances right ventricular function in two rodent models of pulmonary arterial hypertension,
monocrotaline and Sugen-hypoxia. In Aim 2, we will investigate the effects of Lactobacillus supplementation on
gut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation. For this proposal, we will use a variety of approaches from
metagenomics analysis of the gut microbiome, SomaScan proteomics, and single-cell RNA-sequencing to
histological assessments, echocardiography, invasive hemodynamics, and treadmill exercise testing. This
project has the potential to identify a novel therapeutic approach for pulmonary arterial hypertension."

Rapid globalization and urbanization continue to escalate the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
across the world, disproportionally affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Nepal is one of the
fastest urbanizing LMICs where the NCD burden has skyrocketed. In Nepal, control of the major three NCD
risk factors – high blood pressure (BP), high blood glucose (BG) and smoking—are dismally low, particularly
in urban areas, due to multiple levels of adverse health determinants. One reason for poor control is a
dearth of physician and nurses. Community health workers (CHWs) can fill this void. To date, trials have
documented that task-sharing with CHWs reduces systolic BP and fasting BG and achieves smoking
cessation. However, most trials have been done in rural areas, and most trials of CHWs tested management
of a single condition, e.g. just hypertension. Furthermore, despite demonstrated impact in systematic
reviews, task-sharing with CHWs is far from being fully implemented in health care delivery systems in
LMICs, including Nepal.
In this context, we propose to conduct the first implementation research study on task-sharing with CHWs for
concurrent management of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking in an urban, LMIC setting. Our
overarching goal is to scale up our demonstrated evidence-based task-sharing interventions to
address three NCD risk factors in which we engage key stakeholders and partners, and use
contemporary mobile health (m-health) tools. This study, a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation
research study, will be conducted in 33 study sites in Pokhara, the second largest city in Nepal. Building
upon our teams’ three CHW-led, home- based interventions that significantly reduced BP and fasting BG,
and improved smoking cessation rate in semi-urban areas in Nepal as well as an m-health intervention that
lowered systolic BP in an urban area in Nepal, we will develop the intervention package named SCALE-
NCD. Our specific aims are 1) Establish a partnership with stakeholders in Pokhara in order to
institutionalize and sustain the intervention, 2) Understand equity, determinants, and structured barriers for
scale-up of the intervention, and 3) Determine the effectiveness of the SCALE-NCD intervention, and its
impact on reach, adoption, fidelity, sustainability, and cost. This study will be led by exceptionally strong
team of implementation scientists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and anthropologists in the field of NCDs who
have built trusted relationship with stakeholders in Nepal over time, including policy makers, implementors,
advocates, health professionals, CHWs, and patients with NCDs. Greater understanding of “how” the
intervention can be scaled up will inform key steps for implementation of task-sharing with CHWs in health
care delivery systems in LMICs."

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) bloodstream infections (BSI) are
associated with mortality upwards of 30%. It is unknown whether optimal antibiotic treatment differs based on
the type of ESBL enzyme produced. Most microbiology laboratories do not test bacteria for ESBL production,
opting instead to use non-susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics “3GCephNS” (e.g.,
ceftriaxone MIC ≥2 µg/mL) as a proxy for ESBL production. While this approach is pragmatic, it has hampered
progress in understanding the molecular epidemiology and targeted treatment strategies for ESBL families.
Our preliminary data suggest that 3 ESBL families account for ~99% of ESBLs: CTX-M (~60%), SHV-variants
(~25%), and TEM-variants (~15%). However, our understanding of optimal treatment of ESBL-E is limited to
CTX-M-producing infections. A resistance mechanism-based approach has been used to optimize antibiotic
treatment against carbapenemase genes (e.g., blaKPC, blaNDM), contributing to a ~200% reduction in mortality.
We believe a similar “precision medicine” approach should be investigated for treating ESBL-E BSI.
The need to characterize the type of ESBL produced is demonstrated by a clinical trial comparing outcomes of
patients with 3GCephNS BSIs receiving either piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) or meropenem. Mortality was
significantly lower for patients receiving meropenem. Meropenem was henceforth adopted as first-line therapy
for 3GCephNS BSIs (and by extension ESBL-E BSI). However, 87% of patients (no US patients included)
were infected with CTX-M-producing isolates. While CTX-M are the most common ESBL enzymes, they are
not the only ESBLs. It is unknown if meropenem is the preferred therapy for SHV and TEM ESBL variants.
There are differences in preferred substrates, inhibitors, and hydrolyzing abilities across ESBL enzymes. PTZ
may be effective treatment for BSI caused by specific ESBL families, as supported by our preliminary data. If
indeed, PTZ is a reasonable treatment option for certain ESBL-E families, then prescribing meropenem for all
ESBL-E infections without discrimination based on the type of ESBL family will only serve to fuel the crisis of
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, without leading to improvements in patient outcomes.
Using a cohort of 2,000 consecutive 3GCephNS Enterobacterales BSI (diverse species) from 5 US hospitals,
we will characterize the epidemiology of β-lactamases. We hypothesize that blaCTX-M genes comprise ~60% of
β-lactamase genes. For ~40% of isolates, non-CTX-M ESBL genes (± ampC or narrow-spectrum β-lactamase
genes will be identified). Then, we will conduct an observational study to determine if patients infected with BSI
isolates producing non-CTX-M ESBL enzymes (i.e., SHV or TEM) have improved outcomes if receiving
meropenem vs. PTZ using a sophisticated inverse probability of treatment weighting approach incorporating
propensity scores. We hypothesize that PTZ will be effective treatment for ESBL-E caused by SHV and TEM
families given their reduced β-lactam hydrolyzing potential."

The goal of this program grant proposal is a better mechanistic understanding of the core Cyclin D-Cdk4/6-Rb-
E2F pathway regulating the G1/S transition controlling cell division. The overarching hypothesis of the program
is that an increased mechanistic understanding of G1/S control will provide fundamental advances in
understanding the control of human cell division to facilitate development of novel cancer therapeutics. Our
project aims all use biochemistry, genetics, and mass spectrometry to generate hypotheses for molecular
mechanisms controlling interactions in the Cyclin D-Cdk4/6-Rb-E2F pathway. To test these hypotheses in vivo,
all projects will rely on the cell phenotyping and molecular imaging core. Imaging is a key technology for testing
molecular mechanisms in live cells. In particular, time lapse single cell analysis is the gold standard for assessing
effects of mutations on cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition. In addition to time lapse imaging, Core C
will provide access to fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy methods (FCS and FCCS) that allow the
measurement of protein concentrations in molar units, and the measurement of the dissociation constants of
specific proteins in live cells (e.g., Rb and E2F). These capabilities will allow definitive testing of biochemical
mechanisms for regulation along the Cyclin D-Cdk4/6-Rb-E2F axis generated by our in vitro and genetic studies
in each Project. To serve the Projects, this core aims to 1) use CRIPSR/Cas9 genome editing to generate mutant
cell lines; 2) image gene expression, cell growth, and cell cycle transition dynamics at single cell resolution; and
3) build and maintain software that analyzes the terabytes of time lapse imaging data. These cell phenotyping
analyses will feedback and refine our mechanistic hypotheses, which we expect will lead to further genome
editing and testing."

Exercise training is linked to beneficial effects on maladaptive immune aging. In patients with rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), exercise training is a disease modulating therapy and may improve premature biological aging
inherent in RA, however, the mechanisms by which exercise benefits immune health is poorly understood.
Improved knowledge of the specific types of exercise and the mechanisms by which exercise reduces disease
activity in RA will enhance clinical care for older adults with chronic inflammatory conditions. Further, this work
has potential to generalize to improving immune function in older adults without inflammatory conditions.
My career goal is to lead a comprehensive exercise rheumatology translational research program to study the
effects of exercise on disease-promoting immune-aging pathways and personalized lifestyle prescriptions for
older patients with rheumatic disease. I plan to gain the training and experience to become a leader in exercise
rheumatology studying lifestyle interventions for improving immune aging in chronic inflammatory diseases. In
particular, I will complete three objectives to address the key gaps in my career development training: 1)
develop geroscience-specific competency in clinical aging research assessments; 2) acquire skills in
translational aging science statistical analysis; and 3) cultivate clinical-translational aging research leadership
skills. Further, I will achieve my career development plan with expert guidance of my mentors and collaborators
at the Duke Molecular Physiology Institute and Duke Aging Center.
In the proposed study, I will investigate whether exercise training-induced benefits to RA are linked to
improvements in T cell function, T cell mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, and markers of T cell aging. In Aim
#1 and Aim #2, I will utilize data from a NIH-funded randomized, controlled trial to determine if compared to
lifestyle counseling, a remotely supervised caloric restriction and exercise training (CRET) program leads to
greater improvement in RA regulatory T cell function and metabolism (Aim #1) and T cell aging (Aim #2). In
Aim #3, I will perform an independent pilot study to inform future investigations on the best exercise doses and
intensities to improve RA immune aging. To this end, I will determine if a remotely supervised high-intensity
aerobic exercise training intervention is safe, acceptable, and feasible. Results from my Aim #3 pilot study will
inform my planned R01 randomized controlled trial proposal comparing remotely supervised moderate- versus
high-intensity aerobic exercise training on RA immunoregulatory function and immune aging. With successful
completion of this K23 project, I will bridge the gap to achieving my career goal of becoming a leader in aging
science and physical activity interventions for older patients with RA and chronic inflammatory diseases."

E-cigarettes, or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are the most frequent tobacco product used by
adolescents (As, aged 14-17) and young adults (YAs, aged 18-24). While growing evidence suggests ENDS
as a possible strategy for smoking cessation among established adult smokers, the majority of A/YAs report
never smoking cigarettes. This population needs evidence-based treatment to quit ENDS and avoid life-long
nicotine addiction and the potential health harms associated with use. To date, there has been only one
randomized controlled trial on e-cigarette cessation which used the texting program, This is Quitting, to help
YA ENDS users quit. Our goal is to improve understanding of how to help A/YA ENDS users quit and
ultimately increase cessation rates.
This career development proposal is designed to increase our understanding of how to: a) promote A/YA
engagement with ENDS cessation programs; and b) help A/YA ENDS users successfully quit while providing
the training, experience, and data necessary to become an independent physician scientist focused on
designing, implementing, and assessing A/YA ENDS cessation interventions. The specific AIMS of this K08

10807448,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autism spectrum and related neurodevelopmental disorders are thought to arise from widespread mild synaptic
dysfunction that leads to an altered trajectory of brain network development (Johnson et al., 2015). In Rett
syndrome (RTT), a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder, loss-of-function mutations in MECP2 on the X
chromosome lead to a devastating loss of language, motor and visual function at the behavioral level. Yet no
therapy exists to stop or reverse the cognitive decline. Previous work in RTT mouse models reveal synaptic- and
network-level defects that precede symptom onset. Mecp2-deficiency alters the timing of excitatory synaptic
maturation in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the developing cortex (Mierau et al, 2016). Microelectrode
array (MEA) recordings and calcium imaging of neuronal activity in cultured murine cortical neurons reveal delays
in the development of functional connectivity in the Mecp2-deficient cortical networks including smaller network
size, weaker strength of connectivity and impairments in the development of network topology including features
that predict local and global efficiency of the networks (Dunn et al, unpublished). These findings reveal cellular-
scale deficits in information processing that likely underlie the cognitive impairment in RTT and could be targeted
with novel therapies to rescue cognitive function. In my proposed K02 and subsequent R01 research, we will
translate this approach to a human in vitro cellular model of RTT. In Aim 1, air-liquid interface cortical organoids
(ALI-COs) will be generated from RTT patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and allogenic
controls to first identify network-level defects in the development of cortical networks. The ALI-CO model shows
further cortical maturation than previous organoid models and avoids the necrotic core (Giandomenico et al.,
2019). In Aim 2, we will target excitatory synaptic maturation in a specific type of inhibitory neuron in the MeCP2-
deficient ALI-COs using novel cell-type specific modulators we identified (Mierau et al, unpublished). Our goal
is to prevent early synaptic defects and ensure the formation of network activity and topology necessary to
support cellular-scale information processing. This strategy could be used in our future R01 research to prevent
the cognitive decline in RTT. In Aim 3, we will develop novel tools for detecting and modulating network dynamics
in the MeCP2-deficient ALI-COs as a platform for testing strategies to rescue network function in RTT after the
cognitive decline has occurred. Re-expressing Mecp2 in adult Mecp2-deficient mice rescues many behavioral
and synaptic features, raising the hope that neuronal function can be rescued in RTT even after the cognitive
decline. We will next test dynamic electric, optogenetic, and pharmacologic approaches for modulating cognitive
function. This will support the subsequent R01 aims in Year 4 and 5 of the K02 award to test whether modulating
network function in real-time can rescue network function in RTT ALI-COs. This strategy would facilitate
screening of novel therapies to unlock function in symptomatic RTT patients and could be applied in the future
to develop new therapies for autism spectrum and other cognitive disorders."
10811486,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a deadly and disfiguring disease that will accounted for
more than 800000 cases worldwide in 2023. The sixth most common cancer worldwide, HNSCC continues to
increase, in part due to human papillomavirus (HPV) associated oropharynx cancers. The current standard
therapeutic regimens of surgery, chemotherapy, therapy and anti-PD-1 therapy are associated with significant
morbidity and loss of quality of life, with only modest 5-year survival rates. Immune therapy has offered new
options for HNSCC patients; treatment with T cell checkpoint inhibitors or therapeutic vaccines has led to gains
in survival for a portion of treated patients. However, the majority of HNSCC patients are resistant to these
therapies. Improved therapeutic approaches that target mechanisms of treatment escape hold promise for this
disease. We have found that HNSCC tumors are abundantly infiltrated by immune suppressive myeloid cells,
including monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes, which inhibit T cell recruitment and activation, leading to
immune suppression and resistance to checkpoint inhibitors in HNSCC. Inhibitory targeting of
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, PI3Kgamma (PI3Kg), a myeloid cell specific PI3K isoform,
reduces myeloid cell accumulation and converts remaining myeloid cells into pro-inflammatory cells, leading to
T cell activation and tumor inhibition in mouse models of HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC tumors. PI3Kg inhibition
synergizes with checkpoint inhibitors, stimulating T cell recruitment, activation, and memory formation. Based on
these findings, the PI3Kg inhibitor, IPI-549 (eganelisib), was developed as an immune oncology therapeutic and
has exhibited anti-tumor responses in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for the treatment of newly diagnosed cancer.
Spatial transcriptomics of HNSCC patient tissues from clinical trials showed us that PI3Kg antagonism enhances
biomarkers of myeloid cell and T cell activation in HNSCC patients. These bench to bedside to bench studies
identified novel myeloid cell, T cell and B cell biomarkers of response to PI3Kg inhibitors, as well as biomarkers
of treatment resistance. However, they also revealed potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. To
advance our understanding of PI3Kg inhibition in HNSCC, we propose to test the hypothesis that inhibitory
targeting of PI3Kg in tumor associated macrophages promotes both humoral and cellular immune responses that
suppress HNSCC tumor cell survival but also activates novel mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. The specific
aims of this proposal are: 1) To determine critical molecular and cellular regulators of PI3Kg mediated tumor
immune suppression in mouse models of HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC 2) To discover and target mechanisms of
resistance to PI3Kg inhibition in models of head and neck cancer.3) To identify circulating biomarkers of response
and resistance to PI3Kg inhibition that reflect intratumoral tumor biology in HNSCC patients for use in future
therapeutic monitoring."

A range of synthetic bone graft substitutes loaded with therapeutic growth factors, such as recombinant human
bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP2), are used for reconstructing craniofacial bone defects in patients
suffering from trauma, infection, congenital anomalies, and oncologic resection. However, these strategies often
involve the administration of supraphysiological doses of growth factors, which have been reported to lead to
serious off-target tissue responses, including heterotopic ossification (bone formation at undesirable places),
osteolysis, and swelling. The objective of this proposal is to design osteoinductive biomaterials to induce in situ
bone regeneration in the absence of exogenous growth factors. This project builds upon the PI’s extensive
published and preliminary data on a new class of two-dimensional (2D) mineral-based nanoparticles, known as
nanosilicates, to induce osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in the absence of growth
factors. Also, nanosilicate-based shear-thinning biomaterials can be used for minimally invasive cell therapy.
The central hypothesis is that nanosilicate-based biomaterials will activate endogenous cells to promote bone
formation in the absence of exogenous growth factors. To test this hypothesis three independent specific aims
are proposed: (1) Elucidate the molecular mechanism of nanosilicate-induced osteoinductivity; (2) Design 3D
printed nanosilicates-loaded microporous scaffolds for rapid cellular invasion and angiogenesis; and (3)
Demonstrate in situ bone regeneration using 3D printed nanosilicates-loaded microporous scaffolds. It is
expected that the ability of nanosilicate-based biomaterials to induce in situ bone regeneration by stimulating
endogenous cells will circumvent the current clinical limitations associated with the use of supraphysiological
doses of growth factors. The proposed research is significant because it will advance and expand the
understanding of how this new class of 2D nanomaterials can be used in bone tissue engineering. The
completion of the proposed work will provide a new class of osteoinductive biomaterials for future studies in
larger animal models and eventually advance bone regeneration approaches for humans."

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common in utero infection, causing hearing loss and other
neurodevelopmental defects in congenitally infected infants. Despite high prioritization and over 40 years of
research in the field, a CMV vaccine has yet to be licensed for clinical use. We are just beginning to
understand immune correlates of protection against HCMV, and Fc-mediated antibody effector functions, such
as antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and cytotoxicity (ADCC), have recently been implicated
in prevention of placental CMV transmission. CMV is adept at immune evasion, and targeting immune evasion
mechanisms that interfere with key immune responses is a promising strategy for producing more effective
vaccines, potentially through simple modification to vaccines already in development. HCMV expresses three
viral Fcγ receptors (vFcγRs), glycoproteins capable of binding to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG), that
interfere with antiviral Fc-mediated effector responses. The purpose of this work is to define the humoral
immune responses against vFcγRs, both during natural infection and following vaccination with vFcγR protein
subunits, to determine if antibodies targeting these proteins can block their Fc-binding ability, thereby
improving Fc-mediated effector responses. In Aim 1, we propose to define vFcγR-specific immune responses
in chronically HCMV-infected individuals. We will then utilize a rabbit immunogenicity model to define the
immunogenicity of vFcγR protein subunit vaccine antigens (gp34, gp68, gp95) in combination with common
glycoprotein immunogens, glycoprotein B (gB) and/or the pentameric complex (PC), adjuvanted with squalene
emulsion. The primary goal will be to identify the optimal combination of vFcγRs and glycoproteins that elicit
the best ADCP and ADCC responses, in terms of both magnitude and breadth. In Aim 2, we will define
vaccine-elicited gB-, PC-, and vFcγR-specific B and T cell responses. In Aim 3, we will test our primary
hypothesis that co-immunization with glycoprotein(s) and vFcγRs will result in improved glycoprotein-specific
Fc-mediated functional antibody responses. Given the importance of Fc mediated effector responses in
prevention of congenital CMV, observed improvements in these responses upon co-immunization would
suggest that such a vaccine would have greater efficacy in preventing congenital CMV given the demonstrated
importance of those responses in preventing vertical CMV transmission. Additionally targeting vFcγRs through
active vaccination may be a simple modification to current vaccine strategies to yield stronger responses that
have a demonstrated impact on vertical CMV transmission."

Anti-integrin α4β7 therapy (vedolizumab) has demonstrated outstanding safety and efficacy for the treatment of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a relatively common, chronic, incurable pair of idiopathic immune-mediated
diseases of the intestines (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) that typically strike in youth to early adulthood
to produce lifelong suffering and disability. However, for unknown reasons, many IBD patients do not respond
to even this therapy. We recently generated evidence that this therapy selectively affects the intestinal
migration of dendritic cells (DC) rather than T cells, as had been widely presumed. We therefore seek to
demonstrate that directly observing the nature of these DC, and their response to vedolizumab, will improve
our currently limited clinical tools for predicting and optimizing the efficacy of this therapy. Additionally, by
demonstrating that DC are the actual target of this profoundly specific yet effective therapy, we have implicated
them directly in the pathogenesis of IBD, which to date remains poorly understood. We therefore propose to
perform a detailed analysis on DC from the blood and colonic mucosa of IBD patients to correlate their
phenotype and diversity with the presence or absence of inflammation, and more specifically how vedolizumab
induces remission in IBD. By doing so, we will not only improve our existing tools for helping IBD patients, but
also reveal for new strategies to treat or even cure this significant public health problem."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), primarily caused by cigarette smoking, is the third leading cause
of death in the United States. Remarkably, individuals with similar smoking histories have different susceptibility
to develop the disease, and patients display a variable degree of clinical manifestations. Genetic factors may
account for these differences, but the functional, cellular and molecular basis of the variation remains to be
explored. This project aims to bridge knowledge from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of COPD
to the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease by utilizing the observations that (1) inflammatory response
is one of the most prominent differences upon cigarette smoke exposure and (2) a genetic animal model based
on GWAS recapitulates the prominent features of a severe inflammatory response in COPD.
Specifically, we found that genetic mouse models deficient of Hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP), a gene
consistently associated with COPD in GWAS, not only recapitulate robust emphysema susceptibility, but display
a strong inflammatory phenotype similar to human COPD. In particular, an increase in activated CD8+T cells is
observed along the course of emphysema development. Preliminary studies using single cell RNA sequencing
showed that Hhip expression is restricted to lung fibroblasts and absent from immune cells including the
lymphocytes. Moreover, Hhip deficient lung fibroblasts have increased expression of cytokines known to activate
CD8+T cells. These findings led us to hypothesize that reduced HHIP expression in lung fibroblasts leads to an
increase in cytokines and activation of CD8+T cells, and these activated CD8+T cells play a major role in
parenchymal destruction (emphysema). We propose to investigate this hypothesis by the following specific aims:
1. Determine whether CD8+T cell activation depends on Hhip in lung fibroblasts, 2. Determine the functional
importance of lymphocytic activation induced by Hhip-deficiency in smoke-induced lung inflammation and 3.
Determine the relationships between HHIP risk locus and pulmonary lymphocytic inflammation in human
subjects.
Dr. Yun will perform this work under the mentorship of Dr. Hersh, an expert in the field of COPD genomics, Dr.
Zhou, an expert in the field of functional genomics, and Dr. Silverman, an expert in COPD genetic epidemiology.
With the guidance of her mentors and scientific advisory committee composed of distinguished scientists with
expertise related to key areas of this proposal including lung immunology, functional validation and biostatistics,
Dr. Yun has developed a comprehensive five-year training program. This K08 award will support Dr. Yun to
develop the skills needed to become an independent physician-scientist with the long-term goal of understanding
how genetic variation modifies COPD by bridging human ‘omics data and functional validation of candidate
genes."

Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) intervention can increase language, literacy, social, and
adaptive skills for children with severe communication impairments. However, AAC is underutilized in speech-
language therapy for toddlers with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Hybrid telehealth models
can transform the delivery of early AAC interventions by expanding access to speech-language pathologists
(SLPs) with AAC expertise and reducing geographic and transportation barriers in underserved communities.
The purpose of this proposal is to develop and pilot test a hybrid telehealth AAC intervention for toddlers
with IDD and their families. We employ an implementation science approach, using systematic qualitative
methods to identify caregiver and SLP preferences and single-case experimental design methods to assess
the feasibility of the AAC intervention. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will improve caregivers’
use of AAC strategies, which will lead to increases in children’s expressive communication skills. Three
specific aims are proposed. Aim 1: Determine stakeholders’ preferences and needs for two key AAC
intervention components: (a) service delivery and (b) strategies to enhance treatment adherence. We
will conduct interviews with caregivers and SLPs to assess their needs and preferences regarding the
intervention. Interview findings will inform initial modifications to the service delivery model and treatment
adherence strategies investigated in Aims 2 and 3. Aim 2: Develop an AAC intervention through iterative
testing cycles. We will conduct six multiple baseline designs across behaviors to refine the AAC intervention
and demonstrate preliminary efficacy using an in-person service delivery. Findings from this study will inform
adaptations for a hybrid telehealth delivery of the AAC intervention, involving both in-person and telehealth
sessions evaluated in Aim 3. Aim 3: Conduct a pilot test of a hybrid telehealth AAC intervention. We will
pilot test the hybrid telehealth AAC intervention using a combination multiple-probe design across participants
and behaviors. Nine parent-child dyads will receive 24 intervention sessions, eight sessions provided to
families in-person, and 16 provided via telehealth. The primary outcome is caregivers’ use of AAC intervention
strategies, and the secondary outcome is child communication acts. This proposal is innovative because it
uses implementation science methods to develop a novel hybrid telehealth AAC intervention that is
feasible, acceptable, and appropriate for its end-users, increasing the likelihood of widescale adoption in
routine clinical practice. The project is significant because it addresses a critical need for early AAC
language interventions designed for home use. Our expected outcomes are to have developed the AAC
intervention and implementation strategies in preparation for an R01 application to conduct a large-scale
clinical trial."
10813186,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Long-term potentiation (LTP) of primary afferent synapses onto spinal projection neurons (PNs) has
been linked to increased pain sensitivity. The timing rules controlling the generation of LTP in adult PNs can
be persistently relaxed by neonatal tissue damage, which likely contributes to the ability of early life injury to
‘prime’ nociceptive circuits and thereby exacerbate pain after subsequent insult. In the brain, the temporal
window governing this spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is strongly regulated by G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR) signaling evoked by neuromodulators such as dopamine (DA). This raises the possibility that
neonatal injury facilitates LTP at primary afferent synapses onto adult PNs, and thereby promotes persistent
pain, via long-term changes in spinal neuromodulatory signaling. Unfortunately, it remains unknown how
GPCRs influence STDP at sensory synapses onto PNs. As a result, the cellular and molecular mechanisms
underlying the increased amplification of ascending nociceptive transmission by the adult dorsal horn during
the primed state are poorly understood. The objective of this application is to identify the neuromodulatory
signals that promote the activity-dependent strengthening of sensory synapses onto the key output neurons of
the spinal nociceptive circuit and contribute to the priming of developing pain pathways after early life injury.
The central hypothesis is that ‘non-Hebbian’ LTP at sensory synapses onto spinal PNs is enabled by D1-like
(i.e. D1/D5) dopamine receptor activation, occurring in concert with mGluR5-dependent intracellular Ca2+
release and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, which is essential for neonatal priming. The
rationale of the proposed research is that these studies will identify novel molecular strategies to reduce the
signaling gain of the spinal nociceptive network. Guided by strong preliminary data, the central hypothesis will
be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Elucidate how DA receptor activation shapes STDP in
PNs; (2) Identify the signaling pathways which cooperate with DA receptors to facilitate LTP in PNs; and (3)
Identify the neuromodulators which mediate the priming of spinal nociceptive circuits following neonatal tissue
damage. These aims will be accomplished by using a multidisciplinary experimental approach that includes
electrophysiological characterization of STDP in PNs combined with both reflexive and non-reflexive behavioral
measures of pain. The proposed work is innovative because it will be the first to demonstrate that DA signaling
dictates the timing rules governing the plasticity of sensory synapses onto spinal PNs. The outcome of these
investigations will be the identification of new spinal mechanisms that augment nociceptive transmission to the
brain, and the demonstration that aberrant neuromodulation contributes to the persistent sensitization of spinal
nociceptive circuits after early tissue damage. Thus the proposed research is significant because it will provide
knowledge needed to design novel interventional strategies to disrupt spinal LTP as a means to alleviate
chronic pain and to minimize the long-term consequences of neonatal tissue injury for the developing CNS."

A central role of estrogen is regulating hydration balance in the body. Decreases in body (systemic) hydration,
cause systemic vocal fold dehydration. Systemic vocal fold dehydration alters the biology of the tissue.
Nevertheless, the importance of estrogens in regulating these biological changes of systemic vocal fold
dehydration remain unknown. We address this important clinical and theoretical issue by investigating the
transcriptome, proteome, tissue morphology, and ultrasonic vocalization outcomes in a study design that
carefully manipulates hormonal state and hydration state. We will also examine the effects of estrogen on the
vascular geometry and blood flow to the larynx following the interaction of systemic dehydration with altered
hormonal states. We use the rat animal model for these studies since this model allows for robust and rigorous
control of hydration and hormonal levels. Because estrogen is important irrespective of biological sex, both
male and female rats will be included. To examine the effects of hormonal loss and replacement, we will
measure outcomes when reproductive organs have been surgically removed (ovariectomized and
orchiectomized rats) and when estrogen replacement with estradiol is delivered. Systemic dehydration will be
induced by a translational paradigm of water restriction for 5 days. Animals with free access to water will serve
as controls for dehydration. Across 16 animal groups, our first goal is to quantify the effects of hormonal loss
on the molecular and histologic signatures of vocal fold dehydration and the influence of estradiol replacement
on these signatures. Because hormone receptors are differentially located across vocal fold mucosa and
muscle, and these tissue layers have distinct cellular organization and biomechanical properties, the vocal fold
mucosa and muscle are examined separately. Our second goal is to investigate the interaction of hormonal
status and dehydration on ultrasonic vocalizations. Our third goal is to examine the influence of hormonal
status and dehydration on vascular geometry, blood flow, and the physiologic consequences of these changes.
By combining molecular, histological, and functional studies, and mechanistic investigations of hemodynamic
modifications, this comprehensive proposal seeks to shed fundamental insight into the effects of estrogens on
vocal fold dehydration biology. These data are needed to drive clinical recommendations pertaining to vocal
fold physiology under conditions of altered hydration and hormonal states."
10813192,"Excess nutrient consumption promotes systemic and tissue-specific inflammatory responses, inhibiting insulin
receptor signaling pathways and prevents glucose uptake. Although specific molecular and cellular mechanisms
that lead to the development of insulin resistance remain unclear, chronic inflammation is central to obesity-
induced T2D. Diet-induced adipose tissue (AT) expansion with infiltration of classically activated macrophages
and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines perpetuates chronic inflammation and insulin resistance.
Therapeutic approaches that directly interrupt innate immune responses are problematic however as they could
lead to immunosuppression and thus have limited therapeutic applicability. We have shown that persistent
inflammation in diabetes and obesity is due to a deficiency in the processes that normally resolve inflammation.
Nonetheless, mechanisms by which obesity induces perturbations in pro-resolving pathways and promote the
development of unmitigated chronic inflammation remains undefined. Physical inactivity contributes to increased
adiposity, markers of inflammation, chronic disease, and premature death, while physical activity protects against
the development of obesity and chronic inflammation independent of reductions in weight. Cellular mechanisms
by which physical activity protects against chronic inflammation, however, remain largely unknown. Recent work
has shown that resolution of inflammation is mediated in part by enzymatic (15-,12-, 5-lipoxygenase, and
cyclooxygenases) conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids into specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs;
e.g., resolvins, lipoxins, maresins, and protectins) that act to quell inflammatory signaling. Importantly, our lab
and others have also shown that obese-diabetic mice treated with SPMs display elevated alternatively activated
macrophages with reduced AT inflammation, improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced wound healing capacity.
Additionally, our lab has shown that high fat diet-induced insulin resistance develops due to elevated pro-
inflammatory lipid mediator leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production and that BLT-1 (LTB4 receptor) deficient mice are
protected against diet-induced insulin resistance— a paradigm that also persists in atherosclerotic lesions. These
findings suggest that imbalanced production of pro-inflammatory and proresolving lipid mediators contribute to
obesity-induced insulin resistance. Our preliminary data show that exercise increases AT SPM biosynthesis and
is inhibited by short duration high fat diet (HFD) feeding. We also find that HFD inhibits exercise-induced
alternatively activated adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) levels. Interestingly, adrenal gland expression of
biosynthetic enzymes and catecholamine levels—which our lab has previously shown to stimulate SPM
biosynthesis in macrophages—are reduced following HFD feeding. Thus, we hypothesize that HFD-induced
adrenergic dysfunction inhibits the proresolving response to exercise in AT. In pursuit of the scientific questions
herein, I will hone my basic laboratory skills, learn advanced techniques, develop professional skills and network,
all of which will propel me towards achieving my goal of becoming an independent investigator in academia."
10813193,"ABSTRACT:
Current understanding of cardiac parasympathetic (or vagal) activity unequivocally demonstrates that the vagal
activity to the heart and homeostatic reflex changes in cardiac vagal activity are mediated by cardiac vagal motor
neurons (CVNs) in the brainstem. Therefore, CVNs play an essential role in normal cardiovascular function.
Despite our understanding of CVN neurophysiology in health, the potential for CVN dysfunction in diseases is
still unclear. This is particularly true of our understanding of the complex interplay between diet and
cardiovascular function. In some estimates, Americans are consuming 600 more calories from fat per day then
any time in the recent past. This increased consumption of foods high in fat significantly elevated the risk of
developing cardiovascular diseases. A distinctive hallmark of cardiovascular disease risk is low cardiac vagal
signaling, and the extend of this imbalance correlates strongly with increasing risk morbidity and mortality.
Preliminary data from our laboratory demonstrate that CVN activity is significantly reduced and inhibitory
neurotransmission to CVNs is increased during early consumption of foods high in fat. This reduced CVN activity
parallels a significant reduction in cardiac vagal contribution to resting heart rate. The reduction in vagal activity
can be abolished through genetic knock down of a specific subunit of the receptors that mediate inhibition in
CVNs. Critically, PKC inhibition also abolishes the influence of high fat diet on vagal function, and this increased
PKCδ activity is likely mediated by increased activity of the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor on CVNs. Our overall
hypothesis guiding this proposal is that high fat diet-induced increase in functional expression of inhibitory
receptors in CVNs results in a progressive decline in overall vagal activity. However, critical questions remain,
including how quickly does the increased inhibition of CVNs occur and what role does the PKCδ isoform play in
this inhibition. Therefore, this proposal will 1) quantitively determine the timing of cardiac vagal signaling after
high fat diet, and 2) establish the role of PKCδ in the effects of early HFD on CVN function. The anticipated
results of these experiments will provide fundamental details in our understanding of cardiac vagal regulation
and mechanisms responsible for vagal regulation of heart rate. Identifying the early mechanistic consequences
of HFD on vagal activity could lead to the discovery of biomarkers, and early testing of new therapeutics targeting
disease mechanisms, rather than symptoms."

Properly developed somatosensory circuits are critical for any animal to sense and interact with their
environment. The development of somatosensory circuits requires that each neuron within the circuit to correctly
position its axons and dendrites. This allows them to establish specific synaptic connections and for circuits to
assemble. Within somatosensory circuits, interneurons represent are the most numerous neuron type. The other
types are sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system. In comparison to sensory neurons, interneurons
are under investigated due to lack of tools and knowledge about somatosensory circuit architecture. Molecular
factors, like temporal transcription factors and guidance cues, are known to regulate different aspects of neuronal
development, however the role of these molecular factors has not been deeply investigated in interneuron
dendrite development, synaptic partner selection, and circuit formation. I will test the central hypothesis that
temporal transcription factors regulate guidance receptor expression, and this establishes specific dendritic
morphologies and synaptic connections. To investigate this central hypothesis, in the Drosophila nerve cord, I
will be using the neuroblast 3-3 stem cell and the EL interneurons it generates as a model. In Aim 1, I will test
the working hypothesis in NB3-3, temporal transcription factors, Cas and Nab, activate different sets of guidance
cue receptors in its early-born and late-born EL daughter interneurons, and that this determines differential
dendrite positioning. I use single cell RNA-sequencing, NB3-3 specific gene manipulation of Cas and Nab, and
confocal microscopy to examine dendrite morphology. I expect to connect the role of temporal transcription
factors to the role of guidance cue receptor expression. Additionally, I expect to introduce an innovative
sequencing approach to our current analysis of somatosensory circuit development. In Aim 2, I will test the
working hypothesis that the guidance receptor Roundabout3 (Robo3) is necessary in early-born EL dendrites
and sufficient in late-born EL dendrites to regulate dendrite morphogenesis and position. I will perform Robo3
subcellular localization assays alongside gain and loss-of-function assays of Robo3 to examine the function of
Robo3 in EL dendrites. This aim will serve to identify the requirement of Robo3 in interneurons and develop new
assays to analyze Robo3 localization. Overall, this proposal will connect to previous disparate areas of
somatosensory circuit development. This work will also enable future research to investigate the broad
conservation of neuronal circuit specification and development of therapies for neurodevelopmental pathologies
in which circuit wiring is disrupted."

Recent studies suggest that plasma assays for phosphorylated tau protein at threonine 231 (p-tau231), threonine
181 (p-tau181), and threonine 217 (p-tau217) are highly associated with both brain amyloid-beta (Ab) and tau
pathologies and identify the spectrum of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with high accuracy. These studies suggest
that these simple blood tests for tau phosphorylation offer an unprecedented advance for the diagnosis of AD,
bypassing the need for additional biomarkers, including Ab. Plasma p-tau biomarkers have the potential to be
incorporated in clinical practice as a rapid screening test to confirm or rule out AD and to guide management of
patients with cognitive symptoms. Furthermore, this technology has immediate applications for diagnosis and
recruitment in clinical trials and may serve as a tool for monitoring the effects of drug candidates targeting tau
pathology. However, preliminary evidence suggests that the different plasma p-tau epitopes may differ widely in
sensitivity and specificity to detect AD, depending on the disease's stage at which they are quantified. Thus, a
well-powered study measuring p-tau231, p-tau181, and p-tau217 epitopes in the same subjects’ plasma samples
across the AD spectrum has the potential to elucidate the advantages and limitations of using each of the plasma
p-tau epitopes. This study can also clarify whether the quantification of more than one plasma p-tau epitope can
provide complementary information compared to the quantification of a single assay. Understanding the inherent
characteristics of each plasma p-tau epitope to detect the AD continuum can be crucial in interpreting conflicting
results from studies using the different epitopes that will likely emerge in the coming years. Here, we propose a
non-randomized observational biomarker study measuring p-tau231, p-tau181, and p-tau217, Ab, neurofilament
light chain, and total tau in stored plasma samples from 1,400 individuals across the AD spectrum, characterized
with positron emission tomography (PET) tau and Ab scans, enrolled in well-established cohorts of aging and
AD. All individuals will be assessed at baseline, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up visits. In this study, we aim (1) to
compare the performance of plasma p-tau epitopes to identify early and late depositions of Ab and tau proteins
measured by PET. (2) To compare the performance of plasma p-tau epitopes for the diagnosis of the AD
spectrum. (3) To compare the performance of baseline plasma p-tau epitopes concentrations to investigate
longitudinal cognitive deterioration. (4) To compare the performance of longitudinal changes in plasma
biomarkers for use in clinical trials and their associations with longitudinal changes in PET biomarkers. The
results generated in our study will have an impact on the design of several future biomarker programs, shedding
light on the performance of the plasma p-tau231, p-tau181, and p-tau217 epitopes for numerous applications in
research, clinical trials, and clinical practice."
10813209,"The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), alone or in combination with other cancer treatments is
increasing dramatically with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) common (90%) during ICI treatment. Most
irAEs are symptomatic and symptom self-management with timely reporting of moderate or severe symptoms
to HCPs may reduce irAE severity by early recognition and management, resulting in fewer treatment
interruptions and unscheduled health services. Using a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial
(SMART) design, we will initially randomize 286 diverse survivors (30% Hispanic) who are within 12 weeks of
starting ICIs and who also have elevated psychological distress to an Automated Telephone Symptom

monitoring using the PRO-CTCAE items by an automated voice response technology. Participants are
referred to a printed Handbook with information about symptoms, evidence-based self-management strategies,
and when to report symptoms to HCPs. ATSM automatically sends a weekly symptom summary to HCPs.
Active control survivors will receive automated symptom monitoring only with reports sent to HCPs. Survivors
in ATSM whose psychological distress is still elevated for 2 consecutive weeks during weeks 2-8 (non-
responders) will be randomized for the second time to add TIPC for 8 weeks or continue with ATSM alone. We
hypothesize adding TIPC will improve self-efficacy for symptom self-management, including communication
with HCPs and increase social support resulting in lower indices of psychological distress, other PRO-CTCAE
symptoms, clinician-documented irAES (primary outcomes), and unscheduled health services use and ICI
treatment interruptions (secondary outcomes). With total intervention time of 16 weeks, all survivors will be
interviewed at baseline and week 17 post-intervention, and electronic health record data will be extracted for
the participation period. Specific aims: Aim 1. Determine if primary and secondary outcomes over weeks 1-17
are lower (better) in the group created by the first randomization: the adaptive intervention that begins with
ATSM with the need-based addition of TIPC vs. active control group. Aim 2. Among those not responding to
ATSM on psychological distress during weeks 2-8 who enter the second randomization, determine: a) if
primary and secondary outcomes over weeks 8-17 are lower (better) in TIPC+ATSM vs. ATSM alone group; b)
the extent to which the effects of adding TIPC to ATSM on primary and secondary outcomes are mediated by
increased social support, self-efficacy for symptom management and for communication with HCP. Aim 3.
Explore which baseline characteristics of the survivor, cancer, and cancer treatment are associated with
optimal primary and secondary outcomes resulting from three supportive care options: 1) symptom monitoring
only with automated reports to HCPs (active control); 2) ATSM alone for 16 weeks; or 3) addition of 8 weeks of
TIPC to ATSM if no response on psychological distress during weeks 2-8."

The aim of the Georgia Veterinary Scholars Program (NIH-GVSP) at the University of Georgia College of
Veterinary Medicine (UGA-CVM) is to immerse academically talented veterinary students from across the US in
cutting edge research, inspire them toward careers in biomedical research, and foster a deeper understanding
of the myriad roles, and vital need, for veterinarians in research. Critical to this aim is the NIH-GVSP’s
commitment to broad, inclusive recruitment of students and careful pairing with strong, cross-disciplinary mentors
capable of providing a thorough exposure to the principles underlying the conduct of research and providing a
scientific environment that instills a sense of community. A specific effort is necessary to recruit biomedical
scientists with broad medical training, such as our veterinary graduates, as partners in the nation’s biomedical
research endeavors. Veterinarians are well equipped to provide a critically needed comparative organismal
biology approach to the frontiers of biomedical research, including animal cloning, transgenics, development of
medical devices, and translational medicine. Veterinarians are also ideally trained to recognize spontaneous
animal models of human disease and are critical players in public health disciplines, emerging infectious
diseases, and food safety. Nevertheless, veterinary students are often not aware of the wealth of career
opportunities in research and, in many cases, do not recognize the role of veterinarians in these exciting areas.
Clearly, for the promises of “One Health” and translational medicine to be realized in healthier people and
animals, we will need more veterinarians engaged in research. The renewal of our training grant will help us
accomplish the critical aim of showcasing the excitement and wonder of research careers to future veterinarians
to prompt them to choose research as their career. During the 12- week summer program, seven pre-doctoral
veterinary student trainees (35 total trainees for the five-year project period) are welcomed into the discipline
and camaraderie of the scientific community and challenged to think creatively. Fundamental skills are conveyed
through seminars on ethics, responsible conduct of research, scientific rigor, animal welfare, and communication
skills. Relaxed journal club discussions, team-building exercises, and site visits to local research organizations
contribute to a sense of community and excitement about future research possibilities. The central experience
is full-time hypothesis-driven research with a mentor of the student’s choosing, culminating in written and oral
presentations at the university and national levels. The PI and the 35 mentors spanning 13 departments in 6
colleges and schools within UGA support the program. The NIH-GVSP is designed to capture the imagination of
future veterinarians at a formative time to inspire them to develop into independent investigators."
10813712,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 70% of breast cancers (BC) are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, also characterized as luminal-
type BC; thus, are treated with endocrine therapy (ET). The transition from ER+ luminal cells to ER-negative
‘stem-like cells’ (SLCs) is a major mechanism of ET resistance; however, the underlying mechanism remains
largely unknown. We discovered that Ctr9, a subunit of PAFc transcriptional activator complex, is a determi-
nant of luminal cell identity. Using inducible and stable Ctr9 knockdown (KD) BC cell lines, a substantial
decrease of ER stability and increase of H3K27me3, a repressive histone mark on chromatin, were observed
upon Ctr9 depletion, indicating of a transition from luminal BC cells to SLCs. The cellular plasticity manifested
by Ctr9 engages two downstream effector proteins, Jarid2 and KDM6A, that control the levels of repressive
histone mark, H3K27me3. Ctr9 silencing leads to decreased Jarid2, a subunit of PRC2, and triggers a PRC2
subtype switch from less active PRC2.2 to PRC2.1 with higher H3K27me3 activity. In addition to enhancing
PRC2 H3K27me3 deposition activity, Ctr9 KD results in a decrease of KDM6A, the ‘eraser’ enzyme for
H3K27me3. Furthermore, Ctr9 depletion generates vulnerability that renders BC cells hypersensitive to EZH2
inhibitors (EZHi). EZH2 is highly expressed in SLCs for stem cell maintenance and expansion. Recently,
tazemetostat, an EZH2i, is FDA-approved for the treatment of follicular lymphoma. We hypothesize that loss of
Ctr9 leads to the transition from a Ctr9-expressing luminal lineage to an EZH2-governed SLC, thus the cells
become sensitive to EZH2i. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing three aims: (1) Dissect how Ctr9 depletion
results in transition from ER+ luminal cells to SLCs; (2) Determine the roles of Jarid2 and KDM6A during
luminal to SLC transition and sensitivity to EZH2i; (3) Determine whether Ctr9 and H3K27me3 are predictive
biomarkers for EZH2i sensitivity in vivo and study the inverse correlation of Ctr9 levels with H3K27me3 in
human specimens. Because of the higher levels of expression of EZH2 in ER-negative BC as compared to
ER+ BC, EZH2 inhibition has been extensively investigated in ER-negative BC. The study is of high impact
because our findings that Ctr9 demarcates EZH2 activity and H3K27me3 levels in luminal cells opens an excit-
ing possibility to target Ctr9low/H3K27me3high ER+ BC using EZH2i. Successful completion of this study will
justify a clinical trial to use Ctr9/H3K27me3 as independent biomarker to select ER+ BC patients for treatment
with EZH2i."

In the United States and around the world, people are living longer lives. As the population ages, so does the
number of older adults who may experience declines in memory, attention, reasoning, or other thinking skills.
Some of these changes in cognition can be treated and reversed if caught early. Others can be slowed down
and hopefully one day prevented. Unfortunately, people with cognitive decline or very mild dementia often are
not recognized until late in the disease course when treatments are less effective. As the first health care
professional most people reach out to about medical concerns, primary care providers play a critical role in
detecting cognitive decline early. While many primary care providers conduct cognitive screening at Medicare
Annual Wellness Visits and when patients voice concerns, 9 out of 10 would like more information about who
to screen, which assessment tool to use, and what to say if screening is positive. Deciding who to screen with
a brief cognitive assessment tool is a key part of the process because not everyone needs to be screened, and
primary care providers already face time pressures to address the obvious and immediate concerns of their
patients. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a risk assessment and cognitive screening tool that
requires minimal time and effort from primary care providers or their staff and is sensitive to cognitive decline in
older adults from diverse educational and racial/ethnic backgrounds. The tool will be integrated into electronic
health record systems to make it easy for primary care providers and patients to see results. The specific aims
of the first phase of the project are to modify an existing dementia risk screening index to identify older adults
who are at high-risk for cognitive impairment, develop a brief cognitive assessment tool using tasks that are
easy for older adults to perform yet are sensitive to cognitive decline, confirm their utility in 150 people with
varying levels of cognitive abilities that have already been well defined, and test ways to integrate findings into
the electronic health record. The specific aims for the second phase are to further test the effectiveness of the
newly developed tool in 250 older adults receiving care in a primary care clinic, to find out from primary care
providers using the tool how much they liked it and if it was useful and easy to use, and to integrate findings
into multiple electronic health record systems. Findings from this project will fill a gap in the existing toolkit of
primary care providers and will make screening for cognitive decline quick, easy, and effective."

 In 2018 alone, the WHO reported 1.7 million new cases and estimated 770,000 HIV-related deaths due
to gaps in HIV services. Early detection of HIV would allow quicker intervention and can significantly reduce the
risk of death and further transmission. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop an innovative engineered
CRISPR/Cas-based automated self-testing diagnostic platform for early detection of HIV RNA. The type
V and VI CRISPR/Cas systems when bound with their specific target sequence, activate a secondary collateral
nuclease activity that can rapidly cleave single-stranded nucleic acids in a non-specific multiple-turnover manner.
By monitoring the collateral activity of CRISPR/Cas systems using a FRET-based reporter, picomolar
concentrations of a target can be detected. Jain lab (PI) discovered that 3'-end extensions of CRISPR RNAs
with a short 7-nt DNA, drastically enhances the collateral nuclease activity of LbCas12a by 3.2-fold and termed
it ENHANCE. By applying ENHANCE femtomolar concentrations (700 fM) of HIV-1 target gene was detected in
30 min without requiring any target pre-amplification (Nat. Comms., 2020 & Methods, 2021). The Jain lab
developed a lyophilized version of ENHANCE v2, which is stable up to 30 days at room temperature and in
combination with an isothermal DNA amplification step, achieved a limit of detection of 15 copies/µL of SARS-
CoV-2 RNA with ~97% sensitivity and ~97% specificity in patient samples within 50 minutes (Comms. Med.,
2022). The PI recently developed a thermophilic BrCas12b-based single-pot SPADE assay to detect SARS-
CoV-2 in saliva using a point-of-care device (eBioMed., 2022) and an engineered BrCas12b-based SPLENDID
assay to detect HCV RNA in serum extracted with magnetic beads (Cell Rep. Med.-in revision, 2023).
 Based on the preliminary data, the exploratory R61 phase will have the following specific goals. 1) To
enhance sensitivity and specificity of CRISPR/Cas systems to detect 1000 copies of RNA in 1 mL of plasma
without the need for an isothermal DNA amplification step. 2) To develop an automated integrated microfluidic
device for sample preparation, extraction, and detection of a HIV-1 target by naked eye at 1000 target copies/mL
concentration. 3) To perform a pilot study with the optimized device for validating HIV-1 RNA detection in clinical
plasma samples from healthy (n=60), and HIV-infected (n=60) with 95% accuracy. Only after achieving these
milestones, the project will transition into the R33 phase with the following specific aims: 1) To recruit and survey
200 participants for user acceptability and usability of the device. 2) To perform clinical assessment of the self-
testing platform with 200 participants. This integrated approach will have all the components as defined by the
ASSURED (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free and Deliverable to
end-users) criteria by WHO. The development of this rapid self-testing platform would allow quicker interventions,
reduced outbreak and ultimately reduced deaths in people infected with HIV."

The central goal of this proposed program is to expand the pool of students from Florida Atlantic University
(FAU) who enter PhD, MD/PhD, or related programs in biomedical science. FAU services students in Florida's
fast growing Broward and Palm Beach County, and represents the most diverse four-year public university in
Florida. The institution has recently expanded the number of research laboratories and is forming partnerships
with Scripps Florida and Max Planck Florida, dramatically enhancing the research opportunities for
undergraduates. This proposal leverages these opportunities by identifying promising underrepresented
students from over 5000 majors in Biology, Psychology, and Neuroscience programs that may be interested in
research careers, and engaging them in a critical thinking and research-intensive curriculum beginning
sophomore year. We have developed three years of curriculum that includes specialized courses in critical
thinking, research approaches, and scientific communication. Students will participate in laboratory research at
FAU, Scripps, or Max Planck. As rising juniors, they will attend a summer internship at a partner Research
Intensive Institution. Students will be paired with an Academic Mentor, a Research Mentor and a Near-Peer
Mentor (graduate student) to provide support. One-on-one mentorship will be complemented by a diverse set
of workshops throughout the three-year program. Recruitment to this program will leverage existing support
networks for Freshman and other underrepresented groups, as well as a commitment by FAU to establish a
Pre-URISE program that exposes students to research opportunities early in their freshman year. The
completion of this program will provide support for underrepresented students to engage in research and
receive mentoring that will promote matriculation to PhD, MD/PhD, or similar programs."

The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) efforts of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center 
(HCCC) are managed through two related components – Clinical Research Services (CRS) and Data and 
Safety Monitoring (DSM). These components have grown and strengthened significantly over the prior funding 
period. They are critical to the mission of the HCCC and support HCCC clinical cancer research including 
treatment, non-treatment interventional and non-interventional studies. They encompass clinical research, 
regulatory, and data and safety monitoring. This includes investigator-initiated trials (IITs), National Clinical 
Trials Network (NCTN) trials, consortium trials, and industry sponsored trials. Services provided by the CRS
related to protocol management include protocol selection, development, routing, modification and adverse 
event monitoring. The CRS also provides trial specific support through staff that assist in assignment of trials to 
teams, protocol listing and promotion, accrual tracking, assistance with screening and consenting subjects, 
data management, quality assurance, and education for early career clinical investigators. The CRS works 
closely with other shared research resources to support translational cancer research, particularly Biostatistics 
(Biostats) and the Biospecimens Procurement and Molecular Epidemiology Resource (BioMER). A new 
component of the CRS is the Radiology Core Lab (RCL) that provides quantitative imaging services for clinical 
trials. DSM is coordinated through HCCC’s DSM Committee. The DSM has a distinct function from the 
Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee and IRB. DSM focuses on IITs and ensures the development of an 
acceptable data and safety monitoring plan, assesses subject safety, monitors clinical trial data veracity and 
protocol adherence, and provides education to investigators. CPDM also solicits feedback and responds to that 
feedback by providing innovative infrastructure that meets the needs of clinical investigators."
10814203,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating inflammatory disease that affects the intestine of premature
infants. There is major gap in our understanding of the pathophysiology of NEC, including no cure for this often
deadly disease. This proposal aims to help fill the knowledge gap by defining the role of the developmentally
expressed mRNA binding protein IMP1 in the intestine during NEC. IMP1 plays roles in intestinal barrier
maintenance, immune cell activation, intestinal stem cells, autophagy, and extracellular vesicles (EVs), which
could all effect NEC etiology; however, the role of IMP1 in NEC is not known. Herein I will test the hypothesis
that the RNA binding protein IMP1 post-transcriptionally promotes direct cell-to-cell and indirect vesicle-mediated
communication in the intestine to impact barrier and immune function and NEC development. In Aim 1, we will
utilize genetic mouse models where Imp1 is conditionally deleted or overexpressed in the intestinal epithelium
to compare physiological and molecular responses to NEC challenge with a focus on intestinal barrier function.
We will perform RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)-sequencing to identify novel Imp1 binding targets in the neonatal
intestine and during NEC, validate key targets in patient-derived enteroid models, and examine mechanisms in
monolayer culture systems. In Aim 2, we will identify the role of Imp1 in EV communication and intestinal
macrophage activation to protect against NEC. This will be achieved through direct analysis of EV cargo and
intestinal macrophages. We will examine interactions between EVs, immune cells, and the epithelium using
murine and patient-derived enteroids to define mechanisms governing barrier function and NEC etiology. Studies
of IMP1 will elucidate novel mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of intestinal epithelial communication,
with the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of NEC.
My goal is to become a successful, independent scientist and a leader in the field of gastroenterology, with the
long-term goals of identifying new therapeutic targets to improve NEC treatment and ultimately NEC prevention.
During this mentored career development award, I will refine existing and gain additional skills with the guidance
of my research mentoring committee, Drs. Wong, Good, Marks, Scottoline, Saugstad, and Brody. In addition to
the advice from my mentors and collaborators, I will pursue coursework in immunology and post-transcriptional
regulation, as well as seminars in career development skills including bioethics, grant/manuscript writing,
leadership, and laboratory management."
10936541,"Methadone Patient Access to Collaborative Treatment (MPACT) is a staff-level trauma-informed practice change
intervention for US opioid treatment programs (OTP). It is based on the theory that current OTP practice and culture
likely contribute to the wide ranging methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) interruption (>30%) and relapse (>50%)
rates known to increase opioid overdoses. OTP treatment culture has been described as “carceral,” and “not
healthcare,” with patients reporting being bound to the clinic by required daily supervised medication dosing. Changes
in OTP practices have been called for, but are recognized as ‘almost impossible.’ US federal regulatory flexibilities
intended to facilitate OTP practice change during COVID did not result in wide-spread or sustained MMT delivery
changes or service accommodations such as increased multi-day dosing for stable patients, less frequent urine analyses,
or even telehealth. These accommodations would be highly beneficial to rural and home-bound patients. Evidence-
based OTP practice change interventions are necessary if the US is going to effectively respond to the opioid overdose
crisis. If this lifesaving treatment is available but not well used, we must look to the practice and culture of OTPs. Lack of
practice change may be due to staff beliefs and experiences, including their own histories of substance use disorder
treatment, traumatic experiences, and on-the-job exposure to vicarious trauma. When staff trauma is addressed, we
expect OTP practice orientation will shift from punitive to harm-reduction/patient-centered.
 MPACT is designed to increase MMT retention and decrease in-treatment overdose and patient- and staff- reported
posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). MPACT has four evidence-based components: 1) a 4-module CME/CEU-
accredited trauma-informed psychoeducation training program for OTP staff, 2) a trauma navigation model for patients
and staff, 3) clinic trauma-informed care (TIC) self-assessment, and 4) separate reflective supervisory structures for
counselors/case managers and medical providers. For this proposal, MPACT components will be adapted for OTP
settings with patients and providers in a multilevel, trauma-informed planning process with guidance from the Arizona
transdisciplinary Drug Policy Research and Advocacy Board comprised of methadone and buprenorphine providers,
patients, people with lived/ing drug use experience, harm reduction NGOs, payers, trauma experts, and university
researchers. MPACT will be finalized in year 1, pilot tested and refined in year 2, and tested in a cluster-randomized
controlled intervention trial in OTP sites across the US in years 3-6. The primary means of gathering data are surveys
pushed to staff and patients (baseline and monthly) and retrospective patient chart reviews.
 We enter a period of unprecedented regulatory change for MMT delivery. MPACT can facilitate and support MMT
reform efforts that are planned or already in process. The future of OTPs and methadone treatment depend upon
evidence-based OTP practice change interventions. The pivotal question is: Can OTPs adopt Trauma Informed Care (TIC)
and, if so, does it improve patient outcomes? MPACT seeks to answer this question in a high risk/high reward proposal. If
the answer is YES, then MPACT will be immediately implementable and scalable for any OTP in the US."

Chronic exposure to nicotine in tobacco products results in numerous health consequences (lung cancer,
emphysema, hypertension, etc.) and accounts for over 6 million deaths per year. Relapse rates are high among
those who attempt to quit smoking, and pharmacotherapies that seek to foster smoking cessation have limited
effectiveness. Thus, there is a significant unmet need for more effective strategies to treat nicotine dependence.
Nicotine exposure produces physical dependence, and the physical and/or emotional nicotine withdrawal
symptoms – as compared to the rewarding effects of nicotine – are often the most important contributors to
relapse. Importantly, nicotine cravings and the risk for relapse tend to peak 1 to 2 weeks after the beginning of
abstinence. Unfortunately, few research studies have probed the important question of how/why relapse
behavior develops. Indeed, a critical gap in knowledge exists regarding our understanding of how chronic
nicotine exposure encourages nicotine seeking during abstinence. In this project, we will use a rat nicotine self-
administration model to study the medial habenula (MHb) and interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), which together
comprise a crucial pathway involved in nicotine-related behaviors. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs),
the pharmacological target of nicotine, are densely expressed in this pathway and are responsible for nicotine's
psychoactive and addictive properties. In this project, we intend to identify the relevant nAChRs and brain
circuits involved in nicotine seeking during abstinence. Three independent and complementary AIMs are
proposed, each of which probes a specific mechanistic aspect of relapse-like behavior. In AIM 1, we will use
biophysical techniques, 2-photon imaging, and fiber photometry to probe the relationship between MHb
neuronal activity and nicotine seeking during abstinence. AIM 2 will use electrophysiology, 2-photon imaging,
and a DREADD approach to examine the role of IPN neurons in nicotine seeking. Finally, AIM 3 will identify
specific IPN nAChRs involved in nicotine seeking and determine the importance of nicotinic cholinergic receptor
activity in producing nicotine craving and resultant nicotine seeking. Together, these AIMs will help us
understand how cessation of nicotine intake causes the brain to generate aversive physical and emotional
withdrawal responses that inevitably lead to relapse. Solving this problem could lead to new strategies or drugs
to foster smoking cessation."
10812799,"The goal of this study is to investigate the regulatory networks controlled by Eya1 and its cofactors, as
well as their occupancy of cis-regulatory DNA elements (CREs), in nephron formation. Eya1 is a
transcriptional coactivator with intrinsic phosphatase activity that regulates gene expression through
interactions with DNA-binding proteins, since it does not bind DNA directly. Our previous work has
shown that Eya1 forms critical transcriptional complexes with Six1/4, Six2, Myc, and the SWI/SNF
chromatin remodeling complex to specify the metanephric mesenchyme and maintain nephron
progenitors. Recently, we identified Eya1-regulated genes, associated proteins, and occupied CREs,
including interactions with chromatin regulators other than the SWI/SNF family, cell cycle regulators,
and DNA replication and repair proteins. Notably, we found that Eya1 interacts with multiple
components of the transcriptional repressor REST (RE1 silencing transcription factor) complex and
identified the REST-binding RE1 site in 76% of Eya1-occupied CREs without H3K27ac-deposition.
This RE1 site was present in ~45% of Eya1 target genes that were upregulated in Eya1-deficient
nephron progenitors, suggesting that Eya1 may act as a corepressor associated with Rest-dependent
gene repression networks. Moreover, more than half of the identified Wilms tumor-associated genes
are binding partners or targeted genes of Eya1. This renewal application proposes further studies to
investigate the importance of Eya1-occupied CREs containing Rest-binding RE1 sites in maintaining
nephron progenitor cell identity and how Eya1-BAF interaction regulates nephron progenitor cell
identity/state and commitment. This research represents a crucial step in understanding how Eya1
activity is amplified and diversified by its cofactors and CRE occupancy to activate or silence gene
expression that is crucial for establishing and maintaining nephron progenitor cells. The results will
provide new insights into how dysfunction of the Eya1-regulatory network contributes to kidney
diseases, including Wilms tumor."
10814249,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a spectrum of liver disorders ranging from hepatic steatosis to
steatohepatitis with varying degrees of fibrosis and cirrhosis. ALD is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and
health care costs in the US and worldwide. However, there is no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of ALD.
There is also an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms and mediators of disease progression and
severity. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (s-EH), a master enzyme that regulates the metabolism of endogenous
bioactive lipids (e.g., epoxy-fatty acids, Ep-FAs), has recently been recognized as an emerging therapeutic target
in multiple diseases. The overall goal of this project is to test the therapeutic efficacy of s-EH inhibition at
different stages of ALD severity, and to provide a mechanistic foundation for using s-EH inhibition as a novel
therapy for alcohol-induced liver pathology. Aim 1. To test the therapeutic effectiveness of s-EH inhibition
as a novel therapeutic strategy for ALD. We will: i) test whether modulation of s-EH activity by pharmacological
inhibition or s-EH (Ephx2) genetic ablation can effectively attenuate or prevent EtOH-induced liver injury in
experimental ALD; ii) evaluate whether s-EH inhibition leads to stabilization of blood and liver Ep-FAs; and iii)
correlate changes in Ep-FA levels with markers of liver injury. Systemic and targeted liver-specific delivery of s-
EH inhibitors (t-TUCB and TPPU), and WT and Ephx2 -/- mice (global and liver-specific) will be used in multiple
animal models of ALD, which produce different stages of disease severity and which recapitulate different
features of human ALD. This allows for a rigorous evaluation of the effects of s-EH inhibition at different stages
of ALD severity. Treatment and prevention paradigms will be applied. Aim 2. To explore mechanism(s)
underlying the beneficial effects of s-EH inhibition in experimental ALD. We will determine whether Ep-FA
stabilization mediated by s-EH inhibition plays a critical role in attenuation of EtOH-induced liver injury. We will
test whether n3 vs n6 Ep-FAs exert a greater beneficial effect by enhancing M2 macrophage polarization,
increasing a pro-restorative/pro-resolving macrophage phenotype, and by Ep-FAs-PPARγ-CXCL1-mediated
reduction of neutrophil infiltration. s-EH inhibitors, WT, transgenic fat-1 mice (which endogenously convert n6
PUFAs to n3 PUFAs), and hepatocyte-specific Pparγ-/- mice will be used. In vivo and in vitro studies will be
performed. Aim 3. To evaluate EtOH-induced alterations in s-EH and Ep-FAs in human ALD. Utilizing de-
identified human plasma and whole blood samples, we will: i) evaluate alterations in plasma Ep-FAs and
establish relationships between biomarkers of liver injury and systemic inflammation in patients with alcohol-
associated hepatitis (AH); ii) determine the effects of n3-PUFA dietary supplementation on plasma Ep-FAs in
heavy drinking individuals; and iii) test whether s-EH inhibition and Ep-FAs (including both n3 and n6 Ep-FAs)
can effectively decrease basal and LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in whole blood and
peripheral blood monocytes obtained from AH patients."

Much of the assembly process of the transcription machinery is governed by transient and dynamic protein-
protein interactions (PPIs) that defy standard characterization strategies. Transcriptional coactivators are the
hubs of this process, interacting with transcriptional activators, epigenetic modulators, the polymerase, and other
coactivators to assemble the transcriptional machine. Coactivators also represent a central molecular recognition
conundrum, as the mechanisms by which they interact with such a diverse array with binding partners and the
influence of local binding interactions on longer-range structural and functional trajectories. In the previous
funding period, we developed a molecular recognition model that addresses the first part of the conundrum. Here
will build on this model to discover allosteric modulators of coactivators previously labelled undruggable despite
their central functional roles. Additionally, we will answer the latter half of the conundrum to develop a
comprehensive model of molecular recognition in transcriptional coactivator function."

Lynch syndrome (LS) is a hereditary disease that predisposes patients to colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and
other cancers. Definitive diagnosis of LS depends on detection of a deleterious, germline mutation in one of
the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. A problem arises for clinicians and genetic counselors, however,
when the sequencing reveals a variation, such as a missense mutation, whose effect on gene function is not
immediately obvious. These variants of uncertain significance (VUS) cannot be used to confirm nor rule out LS
resulting in uncertainty about how to manage the patient and their family members. Laboratory studies to
determine whether a VUS disrupts protein function has become one important part of a strategy for
determining their relevance to disease. Studying the function of a VUS in human cells is the most thorough
approach to determining its effects on MMR function. We propose that advances in the culture of human
pluripotent stem cells (PSC) along with the development of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing provide an
ideal model system for testing the functional effects of MMR gene variants. PSCs are immortal, which makes
them a practical model system in the laboratory, yet non-transformed, thus they may more closely resemble
the environment in which the variant protein first influences early transformation events in LS patient cells. In
addition, they are pluripotent which means they can be differentiated into multiple cell types to examine cell-
type specific effects. As LS patients are mostly affected by colorectal cancer, we will further examine subsets
of VUS in human colonic organoids (HCOs) derived from the PSCs. Our goal is to perform a large-scale
screen of VUS in the MMR genes MSH2, MSH6 and MLH1 under the following aims: 1) Examining whether
cancer-associated variants in the MMR genes disrupt cellular repair and response functions in PSCs. We will
perform CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene targeting at the endogenous gene loci to create non-transformed cell
culture models expressing different VUS. 2) For those VUS-expressing PSCs with intermediate MMR effects,
we will differentiate the cells into HCOs and examine their ability to induce an apoptotic or senescent response
to damage in intestinal cells. 3) For VUS HCOs that still display inconclusive, intermediate function, we will
examine longer-term effects on genome stability and cell survival including through the use of mixed wild-
type/variant HCOs to assess whether a survival advantage exists for the variant-expressing cells. This
proposal will assist in the disease significance classification for a large number of MMR gene VUS which can
be used by clinicians and genetic counselors world-wide to assist in managing and preventing cancer in
patients and their families."
10814370,"Abstract: Role of force regulated nuclear structure in expression of osteogenesis
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) exist in a multipotential state, where osteogenic
and adipogenic genomes are silenced in heterochromatin at the inner nuclear leaflet. Activating
the osteogenic differentiation program involves multiple regulatory factors, including physical
force, which is generated in the marrow space during dynamic exercise. MSC experience
mechanical force through their cytoskeletal attachments to substrate, inducing signaling that
alters gene expression. We showed that intranuclear actin structures are affected by changes in
the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, and direct changes in intranuclear actin due to knock down of
nuclear restricted mDia2 (preventing intranuclear actin polymerization) exert profound regulatory
control on gene expression. Further, although both dynamic and static mechanical force activate
RhoA to control formation of the actin cytoskeleton, the nature of these forces appear to have
widely variant effects on gene expression – dynamic force inhibits adipogenesis and promotes
multipotentiality, while static force is associated with osteogenesis. Dynamic versus static
applications may affect gene expression through generating different forces on the nucleus,
affecting nuclear structure and nuclear access of the mechanoresponders, Yap and β-catenin.
 We here hypothesize that nuclear structure, modified by force activated actin polymerization,
contributes to selective MSC differentiation and fate. To address this hypothesis, we propose to
define how cellular actin structure resulting from dynamic or static mechanical force differentially
regulate nuclear architecture and gene expression. In SA1 we will find if dynamic and static strain
differentially modify nuclear architecture (F-actin and lamin structure, nucleoli size and spacing,
cell and nuclear stiffness and FISH localization of Runx2). Our data shows that loss of intranuclear
actin polymerization decreases lamin B1 at the inner nuclear leaflet, thus we will find if force alters
osteogenic gene silencing through lamins, and if alterations in formin mDia2 or laminB1 modulate
heterochromatization of the osteogenic genome. In SA2 we will ask if dynamic and static force
differentially regulate nuclear entry of Yap or β-catenin, and relate cytoskeletal stress transfer to
the nuclear membrane to changes in nuclear access of these molecules. Unbiased RNAseq will
allow us to compare gene expression after dynamic vs static force and ask if nuclear Yap and β-
catenin are critical. Lastly in SA3 we determine if intranuclear actin structure directly controls
access to the osteogenic genome. We will define nuclear structure after mDia2 knock down
(decrease intranuclear F-actin, induces osteogenesis), mDia1 knock down (decreasing
cytoplasmic F-actin) and altering secondary actin branching (induces adipogenesis). In these
conditions we will relate nuclear structure to activation of Runx2 and PPARγ cistromes.
 Upon completion of our objectives we will be able to establish how mechanical forces and
nuclear actin polymerization control epigenetic induction of osteogenesis and regulate nuclear
transfer of YAP and β-catenin."

The purpose of this K23 Career Development Award is to develop Logan Harper MD, MS as an
independent investigator with a focus in health disparity research in sarcoidosis. This funding
will allow pursuit of his research plans to develop a patient centered intervention to address root
causes of health disparities seen in Black sarcoidosis patients. The structured mentoring plan
includes hands-on experience administering and analyzing a large prospective patient
questionnaire study, and using community-based research techniques to develop and pilot test
an intervention collaboratively developed with Black sarcoidosis patients to address root causes
of health disparities. This experience will be supplemented with structured coursework in
statistical and community-based research techniques. This work will provide accelerated
development of an independent career path. Dr. Harper will benefit from a multidisciplinary
team of mentors, including Dr. Daniel Culver, a world authority on sarcoidosis, Dr. J Daryl
Thornton, an expert in health disparities and community-based participatory research, and Dr.
Raed Dweik, a proven mentor of early career researchers.
Under the supervision of Drs. Culver and Thornton, Dr. Harper has quantitatively established
the association of social factors with healthcare disparities, and qualitatively interviewed patients
to understand patient important mediators of health disparities in sarcoidosis. This work
supports the feasibility of the present research proposal, which aims to 1) quantify the
association of patient reported barriers to care with patient important sarcoidosis outcomes
through prospectively collected surveys, 2) utilize community-based research to collaboratively
develop an intervention to address mediators of poor sarcoidosis outcomes in Black sarcoidosis
patients, and 3) pilot test the intervention developed in aim 2 with local Black sarcoidosis
patients to determine acceptability, uptake, and identify appropriate outcomes and sample size
for a future randomized controlled trial. Completion of the proposed project will provide the most
comprehensive characterization of patient reported mediators of sarcoidosis outcomes to date.
Additionally, this work will lay the ground work for a future multi-centered cluster randomized
controlled trial of a novel, patient designed intervention to reduce healthcare disparities in Black
sarcoidosis patients. The training in this structured mentoring plan is designed to provide Dr.

Invasive fungal infections represent a major threat to immunocompromised patients and despite the availability of anti-
fungal antibiotics, mortality rates remain as high as 50%. Candida spp. is fifth among hospital-acquired pathogens and
fourth among bloodstream infections. Human SNPs in the type I interferon (IFN) pathway have been associated with
increased susceptibility to candidemia. While these data suggest a significant role of type I IFNs in C. albicans host defense,
the signaling pathway that licenses type I IFN production and regulation during C. albicans infection remains elusive.
Although small in numbers, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the primary producers of type I IFNs (IFNα and IFNβ)
in response to viral and bacterial pathogens though other cells (i.e. macrophages and monocytes) contribute to type I IFN
production as well. Upon activation, toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 9 can upregulate type I IFN production or
chemokine/cytokine production via IRF-7 and NF-κB pathways, respectively. Although induction of type I IFNs are well
described in response to viral and bacterial pathogens, a crucial knowledge gap remains with respect to the mechanisms by
which this pathway affects fungal pathogenesis. We have made several key observations to define the role of type I IFNs in
response to C. albicans. We show that pDCs from mice infected with C. albicans intravenously significantly upregulate the
activation markers, CD40 and CD86, as compared to uninfected mice. TLR9 and Dectin-1 are required for IFNα/β
production. TLR9 trafficking to fungal endosomes require Dectin-1 and Syk signaling. Furthermore, a microarray analysis
of wild-type and TLR9-knockout macrophages revealed IFN inducible family genes (IFI203, Mnda, and Ifi1) as dependent
on TLR9, implicating its role in the regulation of IFN signaling. Type I IFNs improve killing capacity of neutrophils in
response to C. albicans. We additionally demonstrated that in the absence of critical IFN signaling components (i.e. STING,
cGAS, IRF-3, and IFN receptor) mice demonstrate striking resistance to candidemia, but at the cost of a higher fungal
burden. These exciting data suggest that dysregulation of IFN signaling significantly affects the outcomes of invasive
Candida infections. Lastly, our preliminary studies implicate a role for STING in the production of the negative feedback
regulator SOCS1 (suppressor of cytokine signaling). Thus, our long-term goal is to understand the regulation and role of
type I IFNs in host defense against invasive candidiasis. To address our long-term goal, we propose the following three
aims: (1) elucidate the signaling pathway for TLR9-dependent type I IFN production in response to C. albicans, (2)
determine the impact of cGAS, STING, and IRF-3 in the host defense against candidemia, and (3) identify the mechanism
of C. albicans-induced SOCS1 to block TLR9-dependent type I IFN production. This work will provide greater
understanding of type I IFN response to invasive candidiasis and may lead to novel therapeutic targets to modulate the
immune response to alter clinical outcomes in candidemic patients."

 This is an application for a K23 career development award for Dr. Jessica Deleon, a behavioral
neurologist who is establishing herself as a junior investigator at the University of California, San Francisco
(UCSF). Her long-term goal is to become an independent clinical researcher focused on primary progressive
aphasia (PPA) and speech/ language disorders in diverse patient populations. Through the support of this K23
and the optimal, multidisciplinary training environment and resources at UCSF, Dr. Deleon aims to achieve the
following training goals: 1) advance her knowledge in multi-modal neuroimaging and the neural basis of PPA;
2) develop skills in study design and biostatistics; 3) gain expertise in neurolinguistics and bilingualism; 4)
apply neurogenetics and neuropathology to speech and language networks in PPA; and 5) implement her K23
training and findings into an R01 that focuses on improved diagnosis and treatment of speech/language
symptoms in PPA and other language disorders. To achieve these goals, Dr. Deleon has assembled a
mentorship team including primary mentor Dr. Maria Luisa Gorno-Tempini, a behavioral neurologist and world
leader in PPA and multi-modal neuroimaging; co-mentor Dr. Nina Dronkers, a neuropsychologist and expert in
neurolinguistics and bilingualism; Dr. Howard Rosen, a behavioral neurologist focusing on familial
frontotemporal dementia and neuroimaging; Dr. Lea Grinberg, a neuropathologist specializing in
neurodegenerative disease; Dr. Isabel Elaine Allen, a biostatistician with expertise in study design and
statistical analysis; Dr. Manuel Carreiras, a psychologist who has published extensively in bilingualism; and Dr.
Pei-Ning Wang, a neurologist with immense knowledge in the evaluation of Mandarin-speaking PPA patients.
 PPA is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive loss of speech and language
abilities. It can be mis- and underdiagnosed due to heterogeneity in its disease onset and progression,
speech/language symptoms and neuroimaging findings. This heterogeneity has significant implications for
accurate treatment and clinical trials. In this proposal, Dr. Deleon will investigate how three candidate factors
(neuropathology, genetics and spoken languages) influence PPA heterogeneity by developing a
comprehensive, multilingual speech/language battery and by utilizing multi-modal neuroimaging techniques
(voxel-based morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging and molecular PET imaging). She will apply these
methods in a 2-year (3 time-point) cross-sectional and longitudinal study of 530 historical and newly recruited
PPA patients. Dr. Deleon will identify speech/language symptoms and neuroimaging signatures that predict
underlying neuropathology (Aim 1) and investigate how genetic factors (Aim 2) and language factors (Aim 3)
influence PPA heterogeneity through their effects on neural networks. This proposal will provide new
knowledge to detect PPA, refine PPA diagnosis and pave the way for improved treatments for individuals with
speech and language symptoms related to PPA and related neurodegenerative disorders."

Neurotrophic a-herpesvirus including herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) establish lifelong, latent (non-replicating)
infections in sensory and sympathetic neurons. Recurring reactivation episodes triggered in response to
physiological stress interrupt latency and allow virus reproduction, shedding and spread to new hosts. While it
has long been known that HSV1 reactivation can be triggered by a perplexing variety of physiological and
neurological stresses, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained obscure. Recent studies using
cultured primary neurons to model HSV1 latency and reactivation, allows us to build a detailed but still incomplete
picture of how the virus is maintained in a dormant state and how stress response pathways converge to disrupt
this control leading to reactivation. By applying cutting-edge single cell technologies to a well-defined primary
neuron infection model, we have now identified neuronal factors that are rapidly mobilized in response to HSV1
reactivation and have the potential to block the virus replication program at a defined stage. The long-reaching
goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this cell-intrinsic host response. We
propose studies to identify the viral reactivation signature recognized by the host neuron and will determine why
virus gene expression is selectively inhibited. Furthermore, our multifaceted approach will allow us to decipher
the complex relationship between a viral parasite and its human host. By defining the molecular processes
involved in regulating the behavior of latent virus we hope to gain a better understanding how neurons can be
protected from a wide range of intrinsic and extrinsic insults."

World-wide sequencing efforts have identified recurrent novel genetic lesions associated with disease
progression, inferred patterns of common co-occurrence, and characterized clonal evolution in response to
treatments in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Despite the wealth of available genetic information, these analyses
all rely on statistical inference, thus limiting the possibility to link the genotype to the phenotype. Currently,
understanding functions of high frequency genetic lesions and how they cooperate with their co-occurring
mutations to cause CLL initiation and progression are not available. In this proposal, we aim to understand how
two of the most recurrent genetic lesions in CLL (SF3B1 mutations and ATM deletions) mechanistically impact
CLL initiation and progression with the overarching goal to understand CLL biology, generate novel murine
model, and find new strategies for treating CLL with these lesions.
This proposal is based on our finding that co-expression of mutated Sf3b1 with Atm deletion resulted in the
development of clonal pathognomonic CD19+CD5+ B cells in blood, marrow and spleen at low penetrance in
aged (18 months) mice, that can be propagated by in vivo passaging. Interestingly, whole-genome sequencing
of DNA from murine CLL revealed recurrent chromosome amplifications, suggesting chromosome instability as
a mechanism contributing to CLL in the mice with Sf3b1 mutation and Atm deletion. We now propose to
investigate the hypothesis that SF3B1 mutations promote genomic instability through RNA splicing related R-
loop formation while ATM deletion further augment genomic instability through decreasing R-loop associated
DNA damage repair (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that modulation of the R-loop formation is contributing to
the acceleration of CLL (Aim 2). Thus, targeting both RNA splicing and DNA damage response checkpoints are
likely to provide synthetic cytotoxicity for CLLs with these lesions (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed work will
create a fundamental foundation to explain how splicing factor mutations impact genomic instability and
contribute to oncogenesis, and provide rationale for designing novel clinical trials in CLL patients with both SF3B1
mutations and ATM deletions."
10814385,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is marked by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment contributing to the overall
therapeutic resistance seen in this deadly malignancy. Although Notch signaling is integral in the progression of
pancreatic neoplasia, its role in the establishment and maintenance of the immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment is unclear. The long-term goal is to define the role of intercellular signaling pathways like Notch
in the treatment resistance in pancreatic cancer. The overall objective of this application is to define how Notch
regulates myeloid and, as a consequence, T cell polarization in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment to
regulate its immunosuppressive nature. The central hypothesis of the application is that Notch serves as one of
the key regulatory pathways promoting the establishment of immunosuppressive myeloid and exhausted or
anergic T cell populations. The rationale for this proposal is that understanding the mechanistic basis and effects
of Notch signaling on the pancreatic tumor microenvironment will identify new approaches to sensitize pancreatic
cancer to existing therapies including immunotherapy.
The central hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims –
1. Dissect Notch signaling in the pancreatic cancer microenvironment;
2. Define the mechanism and direct effects of Notch signaling on myeloid polarization and function;
2. Target Notch signaling to alleviate immune suppression in pancreatic cancer.
We will use a combination of human and mouse pancreatic cancer samples, genetically engineered mouse
models, orthotopic tumor models, and human and murine tumor cell lines will be used. In addition, we will use
human organoids and cancer associated fibroblasts, together with patient-matched immune cells. Notch
signaling will be disrupted via genetic and pharmacologic approaches both in vivo and in vitro to define its role
in myeloid compartment function. The proposed work is innovative because it defines novel roles of Notch
signaling in pancreatic cancer outside its known epithelial function.
It is significant because it allows for the potential development of new immunomodulatory treatments for this
deadly disease."
10814389,"Amyloidogenic protein aggregation is a key event in seemingly disparate biological phenomena, including
those ranging from bacterial biofilms to neurodegenerative diseases. Intriguingly, amyloidogenic proteins do
not form aggregates with a single 3D structure, but rather with several related yet distinct 3D structures that
are linked to unique biological activities (akin to prion strains). How these structurally-unique aggregates
mediate different toxic or beneficial activities is one of the most important questions in the protein aggregation
field. Conformational antibodies specific for amyloidogenic aggregates are invaluable for investigating this
intriguing problem and, more generally, for their potential use as disease-specific diagnostic and therapeutic
agents. The utility of such antibodies stems from their ability to sensitively detect specific types of protein
aggregates and selectively interfere with their biological activities. However, these types of antibodies are
difficult to generate because of issues common to many antigens (immunodominant epitopes) and those
specific to protein aggregates (multivalent, highly hydrophobic and, in some cases, kinetically unstable). The
goals of this proposal are to develop structure-guided approaches for in vitro generation of antibodies against
six classes of predicted conformational epitopes in amyloidogenic aggregates, and to use these antibodies to
evaluate conformational differences between disease-associated aggregates formed in vivo. The predicted
epitopes – which include the leading candidates for generic antibody epitopes in oligomers and fibrils – have
not been specifically targeted or verified previously using monoclonal antibodies. We will primarily target a-
synuclein (associated with Parkinson’s disease), which forms multiple types of oligomers and fibrils. These
studies will address four key fundamental (Q1, Q2) and methodological (Q3, Q4) questions. 1) Which generic
classes of predicted conformational antibody epitopes exist in oligomers and fibrils of a-synuclein and other
amyloidogenic proteins? 2) Which protein-specific classes of predicted conformational epitopes exist in
different structural (strain) variants of a-synuclein aggregates? 3) What are optimal design parameters for
generating in vitro antibody libraries that maximize the likelihood of isolating antibodies with high specificity in
addition to high affinity? 4) What are the most effective in vitro methods for targeting antibody libraries to pre-
selected epitopes in protein aggregates in order to overcome common problems associated with
immunodominant epitopes and poor antigen quality? These proposed studies are based on multiple
discoveries in the Tessier lab: i) novel in vitro library design and sorting methods for isolating yeast-displayed
antibodies with extremely high specificity; ii) bioinformatics methods for predicting antibody specificity; and iii)
identification of multiple classes of conformational epitopes in Ab fibrils. These discoveries provide a strong
basis for rationally generating antibodies against diverse types of amyloidogenic aggregates and for providing
key insights into conformational differences between protein aggregates linked to unique human disorders."

The goal of the proposed study is to elucidate mechanisms contributing to the heightened risk of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hypertension (HTN) in early-menopausal compared to typical-age-
menopausal females. The risks of CVD and HTN increase steeply after menopause, but females who complete
menopause early (< age 46 yrs.) are more likely to experience HTN and CVD-related morbidity and mortality
than those who complete menopause at a typical age (~ 51 yrs.) Furthermore, sympathetic increases in
females after menopause, and higher sympathetic drive is associated with cardiovascular mortality and HTN.
Postmenopausal females have shown dysregulation in autonomic control of blood pressure (BP), but it is
unknown whether BP dysregulation occurs similarly in early-menopausal and typical-age-menopausal females.
Moreover, altered vascular transduction, whereby an increase in sympathetic activity causes vasoconstriction,
may play a role in the development of HTN. This proposal will investigate sympathetic regulation of blood flow
and blood pressure in early- and typical-age-menopausal females. Additionally, individuals who are racialized
as non-white have higher cardiovascular risks than white people, and this study will explore perceived
discrimination and coping as potential mediators of CVD and HTN in postmenopausal females of diverse
backgrounds. To evaluate vascular regulation, forearm vascular conductance (FVC) and muscle sympathetic
nerve activity (MSNA) will be measured via venous occlusion plethysmography and microneurography,
respectively, in postmenopausal females, ages 50-70 yrs., who completed menopause early or at a typical
age. Conductance and MSNA will be measured at rest (SA1) and during a two-minute cold pressor test (CPT)
of the hand (SA2). Importantly, BP responses to a CPT can predict future HTN, and greater sympathetic
reactivity to a stressor may indicate a higher risk for future CVD. Further, physiological responses and
correlations between discrimination and coping scores will be explored (SA3). The hypotheses are that early-
menopausal females will have lower resting FVC and higher resting MSNA, and larger changes in FVC and
MSNA with CPT, than typical-age-menopausal females; and that higher perceived discrimination and lower
coping ability will be associated with higher sympathetic outflow. Dr. Lee will be trained in techniques of
microneurography and venous occlusion plethysmography and will engage in career development activities,
including grant and scholarship development. In addition, she will be trained in community-engagement
strategies during the fellowship duration. She will receive training from an exemplary team in a research-rich
environment within the Medical School at the University of Minnesota. This proposal aligns with the NHLBI’s
mission, identifying mechanisms contributing to HTN and CVD for development of prevention and treatment
strategies to reduce CVD risk in early-menopausal females, while also striving toward health equity. The
proposed study will provide foundational knowledge along with exceptional fellowship training for the applicant."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major unresolved public health issue. Despite decades of research on amyloid-β
(Aβ) and tau, we do not fully understand the complex molecular and cellular biology of these key disease drivers.
The brain reacts to the pathological accumulation of Aβ and tau with an early and profound neuroinflammatory
response, which includes alterations in the profile, function, and activation of microglia, astrocytes, and
oligodendrocytes. Although neuroinflammation is an integral component and putative driver of AD pathogenesis,
the cell type-specific mechanisms that characterize this response and its impact on cognitive decline are
incompletely understood.
 Biased G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands preferentially activate G protein or β-arrestin signaling
pathways and are leading to the development of drugs with superior efficacy and reduced side effects in several
therapeutic areas. Surprisingly, biased GPCR signaling is a largely unexplored area in AD research. In the
previous funding cycle, we developed a G protein-biased GPCR 3 (GPR3) mouse model that lacks GPR3-
mediated β-arrestin signaling. Using this model, we showed that biased GPR3 mice exhibit normal cognitive and
behavioral functions, which are disrupted in Gpr3-deficient mice. We further determined that biased GPR3
signaling reduces Aβ levels and the Aβ plaque burden and enhances the glial response in a preclinical AD mouse
model. These exciting findings indicate that GPR3 is the first GPCR to modulate both Aβ pathology and the
innate immune response in AD. These studies also establish the strong scientific premise that the largely
unknown cell type-specific functions of GPR3 impact the development and progression of AD. Thus, the major
goal of this R01 renewal application is to test the central hypothesis that biased GPR3 signaling in microglia,
astrocytes, and neurons reduces AD-related pathologies and cognitive decline by promoting protective immune
responses and preserving neuronal function. Aim 1 will determine how biased GPR3 signaling alters microglia
activation and function and AD-related pathways in primary human microglia and in vivo in our AD mouse
models. Aim 2 will determine how biased GPR3 signaling affects the cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous
functions of astrocytes in primary human astrocytes and in vivo in our AD mouse models. Aim 3 will determine
the role of biased GPR3 signaling in neuronal function and cognition in directly converted induced neurons (iNs)
from control subjects and AD patients and in vivo in our AD mouse models, respectively. Successful completion
of these studies will establish the in vitro and in vivo impact of biased GPR3 signaling on neuronal- and glial-
dependent pathways and provide proof of concept for the development of safer and more selective GPCR-
targeting therapeutics with more directed pharmacological action for AD."

Human hippocampus is among the most complex tissue types with a wide range of cells organized in spatially
precisely defined regions. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the diseases strongly affected the hippocampal
region, which underlies the core feature of the disease-memory impairment and remains refractory to therapy,
due in part to the complexity of gene regulatory network coupled with cell-type-specific mechanisms of AD
progression. What types or subtypes of cells are affected by this process and their spatial heterogeneity in the
tissue context as well as how these cells impact the tissue environments remain poorly understood, which
precludes the development of strategies to target these cells to improve healthspan/lifespan or harnessing
these cells to promote tissue remodeling and repair, highlighting a pressing need for tools to map cells and the
surround microenvironments in these tissues and generate biomarkers to define spatial and phenotypic
heterogeneity in AD. This grant aims to (1) develop a first-of-its-kind technology for spatial co-profiling of
epigenome, transcriptome, and a panel of proteins in the same tissue section, and (2) deploy the high-resolution,
high-content and high-throughput spatial multi-omics technologies to construct comprehensive maps of cellular
states and the associated environments in human hippocampus from AD patients and health donors. The
expected outcomes and the major contributions of our project include: (1) Fundamental knowledge on diverse
cell types and their molecular basis of selective vulnerability (and conversely the resilience of other cell types) in
the context of tissue organization in the AD human hippocampus, allowing us to develop a
high-spatial-resolution cell census which will in turn allow us to identify molecular signature patterns, gene
regulatory networks, and biological processes potentially mediating cell type specific differences in the AD, and
(2) Offer the possibility of testing new therapeutic approaches for AD that are not targeted by currently approved
treatments. The resulting data will lead to better understanding of the relationship between tissue organization,
function, and gene regulatory networks in AD."

Adult neurogenesis is emerging as an important player in maintaining brain homeostasis and normal functions.
The dysfunctions of neurogenesis have been associated with aging and neurological disorders, including
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The ability to systematically map the molecular dynamics of neurogenesis at single-
cell resolution could serve as a foundation for a systematic effort to better understand the molecular events that
give rise to abnormal cell states in aging and diseases. While the rapid advances in single-cell genomics are
creating unprecedented opportunities to explore molecular heterogeneity in mammalian brains, nearly all such
methods are restricted to low throughput and fail to recover the heterogeneity and dynamics of the profoundly
rare cell states in adult neurogenesis (e.g., less than 0.1% of the cell population in the brain). Herein, we propose
to develop novel methodologies that enable a comprehensive view of temporal-spatial dynamics of neurogenesis
during aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in both human and mouse brains. Specifically, we will first develop a
novel high-throughput, low-cost single-cell genomics approach, sciNext1000, to profile the molecular
heterogeneity of four million cells from post-mortem human hippocampal samples. This approach will be powerful
because we can not only quantitatively characterize the frequency of human adult hippocampal neurogenesis at
single-cell resolution, but also identify the transcriptome features associated with impaired neurogenesis in aging
and AD at isoform resolution. In addition, we will develop another novel single-cell genomic technique, sci-Div-
seq, to enhance the detection of newborn neurons, and identify the cellular differentiation trajectories and
associated transcriptomic features of adult neurogenesis in young and aged mouse brains. The resulting dataset
will advance our understanding of gene regulation in neurogenesis across different neural lineages and
constitute a significant step towards a comprehensive characterization of the molecular mechanism underlying
neurogenesis impairment in aging. In addition to the internal molecular programs, the neurogenesis process is
controlled by aspects of environmental signals from the neural stem niche. We will apply a high-throughput
spatial transcriptomic strategy to identify the cellular interactions and local microenvironment involved in adult
neurogenesis in both human and mouse brains. These multi-pronged approaches will open a new paradigm for
understanding the global molecular programs and environmental regulation of adult neurogenesis, thereby
informing potential therapeutic targets to restore cell population homeostasis in aging and brain disorders."
10795937,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The epithelium that lines the airway comprises a variety of specialized cell types that play essential roles in lung
health. Changes in the epithelium are prominent features of asthma and other common lung diseases. During
normal differentiation, dramatic changes in gene expression are required for the development of the unique
functional capabilities of the basal, secretory, and ciliated cell populations within the epithelium. Furthermore, in
airway disease, each cell type has distinctive gene expression changes in response to pathogenic cytokines.
Over the past two decades, we have used transgenic mouse modeling, human cell culture, and clinical studies
to identify molecular mechanisms that underlie changes in epithelial gene expression that contribute to airway
obstruction in asthma. Although we and others have gained tremendous insights from mouse models, our overall
goal of understanding the biology underlying asthma and other human airway diseases has increasingly led us
to focus on developing appropriate human experimental systems. In the past several years, we and our
collaborators have developed a set of powerful approaches including single cell RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, massively
parallel reporter assays, and CRISPR-mediated gene editing, to address mechanistic questions in primary
human airway epithelial cells. These approaches now enable us to perform potentially groundbreaking
experiments that give new insights into airway epithelial cell complexity, identify key regulators of gene
expression and epithelial cell function, and reveal how specific airway epithelial gene regulators contribute to
asthma and other airway diseases. Most disease-associated genetic variants are found in regulatory regions,
and our work has important implications for understanding genetic contributions to airway disease risk. We will
also work to apply insights about gene regulation to develop approaches for therapeutic reprogramming of the
epithelium to prevent, cure, or treat disease. The environment at UCSF provides access to creative collaborators,
cutting-edge technologies, and key clinical resources and affords outstanding opportunities for working with early
career investigators who will be well positioned to continue to move the field forward."

10796813,"Project Summary: 
Modern biomedical research to uncover the metabolic basis of disease is increasingly dependent on the 
application of complex technology. In many cases, the costs associated with the acquisition and maintenance 
of necessary equipment, in addition to the technical expertise needed to run these technologies, typically exceed 
the capabilities of individual laboratories - particularly those of investigators at the start of their careers. Hence, 
the overarching goal for the COBRE Molecular Mechanisms Core is to provide investigators with such 
technologies in the realm of functional genomics and molecular bioimaging, and thus help them to apply state of 
the art approaches in their research projects. The Core seeks to achieve this goal in two Specific Aims: 
SPECIFIC AIM 1: To provide COBRE investigators with mentoring support concerning molecular bioimaging and 
functional genomics technology. Application of modern biomedical technology per se does not lead to 
meaningful or impactful scientific progress; it requires a clear understanding of the power of specific technologies 
for science to emerge from data. Therefore, the Core will serve as an intellectual and advisory resource for 
COBRE investigators when it comes to bioimaging and functional genomics experiments, and provide mentoring 
so that technological approaches match up with the scientific goal of each project. Hence, the goal for this Aim 
is to ensure that COBRE investigators, rather than viewing technology as a perhaps unsurmountable obstacle, 
can in fact embrace these new technologies with confidence to further their science. 
SPECIFIC AIM 2: To provide COBRE investigators with direct technological support for their experiments that 
use molecular bioimaging and functional genomics approaches. To understand the molecular etiology that forms 
the pathogenic framework for disease, technologies that capture gene expression changes are of primary 
necessity for conducting mechanistic research, and the key technologies for the Core are three-dimensional 
imaging of gene expression in whole-mount tissues, and assessment of gene expression using single-cell RNA 
sequencing. The Core will provide COBRE investigators with turn-key access to these technologies in order to 
ensure that they do not get needlessly bogged down in the hands-on technical minutiae, but can fully concentrate 
on the science of their research projects, and on their overall productivity. 
Furthermore, the Core, by relying on its NIH proposal review expertise, and by ensuring that experiments meet 
NIH rigor and reproducibility standards and thus contribute to a strong premise, can provide the mentoring 
environment needed for COBRE investigators to generate competitive NIH grant proposals."
10796819,"Project Summary: 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) results from reduced total number or diminished function of insulin-producing 
beta-cells within the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. How lipid metabolism influences the ability of the islet 
beta-cells to secrete insulin, regulate glucose metabolism, and proliferate has been largely studied almost 
exclusively in isolated islets using acute in vitro approaches. However, studies conducted in vitro have led to 
differential and often conflicting results. Herein, we propose two novel mouse models that allow us to address 
the role of lipid metabolism from two critical organelles to investigate targeted and specific outcomes in vivo. 
This approach will allow us to answer the fundamental question: does inhibition of fatty acid oxidation in 
pancreatic tissue, including islet beta-cells, contribute to alterations in beta-cell function observed during aging, 
insulin resistance, and diabetes? To address this question, we will use mice lacking either carnitine 
palmitoyltransferase-1a (CPT-1a; Aim 1), a mitochondrial gene, or Pex5 (peroxisomal gene; Aim 2) in 
pancreatic and islet tissue. In Specific Aim 1, we will use the pancreas-specific deletion of the Cpt1a gene in 
combination with low-fat and high-fat diets to determine whether limiting fatty acid oxidation enhances glucose 
metabolism to support insulin secretion. In this experiment, we will also assess whether fatty acid oxidation is 
critical for the expansion of beta-cells observed during states of insulin resistance in vivo. In Specific Aim 2, we 
will limit fatty acid oxidation in the peroxisomal compartment, which regulates the metabolism of very long 
chain fatty acids, to determine whether this enhances beta-cell function or promotes lipid storage to generate 
metabolic stress and key features of lipotoxicity. These novel genetic approaches will provide critical insights 
into the role of lipid oxidation during aging and obesity. Understanding the principles and mechanisms 
underlying fatty acid oxidation on islet biology in vivo have important implications for suppressing, treating, and 
curing obesity- and aging-associated metabolic diseases."

complementary approaches via cutting-edge in silico (project 1, PR1), epigenetic (PR2), and in vitro (PR3)

10796878,"PROJECT SUMMARY: IDEAL Data Management Core (DMC)
The overarching goal of the proposed immune development in early life (IDEAL) project is to employ systems
biology to characterize childhood immune trajectories in order to define endotypes of key clinical outcomes such
as vaccine responsiveness, respiratory infection and asthma. In support of this effort, the Data Management
Core (DMC) will establish and maintain a cloud-based discovery environment, consisting of data storage and
computational tools to perform integrative systems analyses of clinical data, lab sample management, and high
dimensional assay results. The DMC will facilitate collaborations between the IDEAL Projects and Cores
including data sharing, submission to public repositories, and engagement with the external research community.
The broad goals of the DMC are reliable data capture and retention, ongoing quality assurance (QA), and
access/computational resources for integrative analyses. We articulate these goals through three Specific Aims,
including establishment of digital infrastructure for data capture, management, and analysis; rigorous quality
control (QC) and QA; and biostatistical and bioinformatics expertise for analysis.
Our data management architecture is designed on the basis of improved institutional capabilities for reliable
cloud-based clinical data management, experimental assay QC/QA, and analytic support. We have worked
closely with the BCH Research Computing Department to implement a system for IDEAL collaborators that will
combine security and reliability with accessibility and state-of-the-art computational tools and resources. Our
approach offers many advantages over more traditional server-based architecture, not the least of which is a
fruitful collaborative computing environment for integrative analyses and scientific discovery.
Any scientific endeavor of this scope and scale requires robust data management plans, infrastructure, and
operations. Indeed, there can be no practical integration of data without an environment to link these data across
platforms. The DMC’s integrative function is necessary to leverage the distinct strengths of the IDEAL projects
and cores into scientific synergies. We expect our integrated discovery environment will augment the scientific
value and productivity of the overall IDEAL study. The DMC will enable us to discover endotype-specific
molecules and pathways, that may serve as prognostic and/or actionable biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes
and/or that represent targets for interventions that redirect IDEAL towards health."
10793715,"Approaches to ameliorate cognitive decline with aging are few and often require behavioral changes that
are difficult to maintain over long periods of time. The novel study proposed in this application will examine how
manipulating dietary fatty acids affects brain functioning in older adults. Prior studies have shown that there are
behavioral changes that can be made to improve cognition in adults on an acute time scale including improving
sleep and physical activity. Based on preclinical data and our prior studies in humans we propose that brain
functioning also can be acutely improved with a reduction in dietary saturated fat. We will use this approach in
cognitively normal older adults without dementia, but we propose that acutely improving baseline cognition is
beneficial in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease even if the overall course of the
patient’s neurological condition is increasingly impaired cognitive function.
 We will manipulate the dietary ratios of palmitic acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA), which are the most prevalent
saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, respectively in the diet and body lipids. Using a crossover study of
men and women, aged 65-75 years, we will administer two experimental diets in a random order for one week
and each experimental diet will be preceded by a one-week, low fat control diet for a four-week total study period.
One experimental diet will have a high PA/OA ratio typical of the usual North American Diet and the other
experimental diet will have a low PA/OA ratio typical of the Mediterranean Diet. We will assess the following
primary outcomes: working memory performance, activation of working memory networks using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional connectivity.
 Specific Aim 1 is to determine in cognitively normal older adults if lowering the dietary PA/OA ratio reversibly
affects working memory performance. Hypothesis 1 is that improved working memory performance will result
from lowering the dietary PA/OA ratio.
 Specific Aim 2 is to determine in cognitively normal older adults if lowering the dietary PA/OA ratio reversibly
affects brain functioning measured by fMRI activation during a working memory task and functional connectivity
during rest. Hypothesis 2a is that increased activation in the working memory network will result from lowering
the dietary PA/OA ratio. Hypothesis 2b is that increased local functional connectivity within the working memory
network will result from lowering the dietary PA/OA ratio.
 The impact of this study is that these data may suggest one mechanism for acutely improving cognition in
healthy older adults and potentially in those with cognitive impairment such as mild cognitive impairment and
Alzheimer’s disease. While changing dietary behavior long term requires additional investigation, there are
potential immediate benefits to acute improvements in cognition on quality of life for older adults."
10793821,"ABSTRACT
 People with schizophrenia (PwS) have high rates of cognitive dysfunction and associated disability,
especially with aging, and there is a lack of effective treatments to improve cognition in PwS. Obstructive sleep
apnea (OSA) is a key modifiable risk factor for cognitive deficits in PwS as it is often underdiagnosed and
undertreated. Untreated OSA may cause cognitive decline and dementia, which can be particularly dire in
middle-aged and older PwS due to lower cognitive reserve stemming from the onset of illness. The
inflammatory mechanisms by which OSA leads to cognitive deficits may intersect with the pathobiology of
schizophrenia. Thus, inflammatory biomarkers may be a key surrogate biomarker of OSA-related cognitive
deficits. There is a critical unmet need for interventions to improve cognition in PwS. However, to design
and power future OSA intervention trials in PwS, the proposed observational naturalistic study is needed to
gather relevant data in PwS and a non-psychiatric comparison (NC) group and include objective assessments
of OSA, cognitive functioning, and comprehensive inflammatory assessments. The overall objectives of the
proposed study are: (1) to assess the contribution of OSA to cognitive impairment, (2) to comprehensively
investigate inflammation as a surrogate marker of OSA and cognitive deficits, and (3) to identify key cognitive
correlates among PwS. The expected outcome of this proposed project is to lay the groundwork necessary for
future OSA treatment trials in PwS.
 We propose a cross-sectional case-control study of 150 PwS with and without untreated OSA and 150 non-
psychiatric comparison subjects with and without OSA, age 40-70 years. The research plan aims to: 1)
examine differences in cognitive functioning in PwS and NCs with and without co-morbid OSA; 2) examine the
relationships of inflammatory biomarkers with OSA and with cognitive functioning; and 3) explore how general
and schizophrenia-related OSA risk factors affect cognitive functioning.
 The innovative approach of this proposal includes a comprehensive multi-level inflammatory assessment
that incorporates systemic biomarkers and gene expression to highlight specific mechanistic pathways and
immune cells and the use of mobile cognitive testing that may be more sensitive to OSA-related changes. The
team for this proposed project includes expertise in aging in schizophrenia (Ellen Lee, MD), OSA physiology
and assessment (Atul Malhotra, MD; Christopher Schmickl, MD, PhD), neurocognitive functioning (Barton
Palmer, PhD), mobile cognitive assessments (Raeanne Moore, PhD), psychoneuroimmunology and sleep
(Michael Irwin, MD), comprehensive inflammatory assessments (Steve Cole, PhD), and biostatistics (Xin Tu,
PhD). Ultimately, this work’s positive impact will be future development of personalized, biologically-based
interventions to improve cognition among middle-aged and older PwS."

Current available clinical treatments greatly reduced the acute mortality of myocardial infarction. However, lost
cardiomyocytes during myocardial injury still cannot be replenished, leading to a steady increase of heart
failure patients. In contrast, adult zebrafish and newborn mammals are capable of robust cardiac regeneration.
This process has been shown to rely on proliferation of preexisting cardiomyocytes after injury. In rodents,
such an ability is lost within the first week after birth when the majority of cardiomyocytes undergo permanent
cell-cycle arrest. However, the physiological triggers of this transition remain largely unknown. Our recently
published work suggests that activation of thermogenic pathways during the acquisition of endothermy in
ontogeny and phylogeny may cause a loss of cardiomyocyte proliferative and regenerative capacity (Hirose et
al., 2019 Science). Following this direction, we discover that increases of neurohormonal activities associated
with postnatal thermogenesis drive cardiomyocyte cell-cycle exit, at least in part by turning on B cell lymphoma
6 (Bcl6), a transcription factor previously unappreciated in the heart field. Moreover, Bcl6 is also identified in
our RNA-seq analysis of all 1179 annotated mouse transcription factors as one of the top candidates that may
induce postnatal loss of cardiac regenerative potential. Intriguingly, cardiac expression of Bcl6 increases 19
folds after birth in mice but not in naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber), a poikilothermic rodent. The
function of Bcl6 in cardiomyocytes have never been reported. Our preliminary data show that cardiomyocyte-
specific deletion of Bcl6 in mice leads to enhanced cardiomyogenesis both in heart growth and after ischemic
injury. We further identify a putative direct target gene of Bcl6, and demonstrate its major contribution to the
phenotypes through genetic rescue experiments in mice. Based on these results, this grant proposal will apply
a novel method that integrates whole-heart clearing, immunostaining and volume imaging by light-sheet
microscopy to accurately assess the total cardiomyocyte number, and exploit mouse genetic models to
elucidate the functions of Bcl6 and its downstream target in cardiomyocyte cell-cycle control during postnatal
heart growth and adult myocardial injury repair. The regulation of Bcl6 in ontogeny and its expression in
phylogeny will be further investigated to understand whether and how its expression increases in parallel with
the development and evolution of endothermy. Altogether, this work will yield significant knowledge about the
physiological brake of cardiac regeneration, and may offer novel treatment strategies to enhance heart
regenerative repair in adult mammals."

10796828,"Fetal membranes (amniochorion) protect the fetus during pregnancy. At term, senescence (aging) and inflammation cause functional and mechanical instability to membrane cells, contributing to parturition. Premature senescence and membrane dysfunctions are associated with preterm birth (PTB) and preterm premature rupture of the membranes (pPROM). However, cellular-level changes contributing to membrane stability during gestation and its dysfunction leading to labor and delivery are still unclear. Recent studies of senescent term and preterm membranes revealed “microfractures” (MFs), sites of cellular remodeling. MFs are resealed during gestation to maintain membrane integrity. Higher numbers of MFs and their increased morphometry (depth and width) in term labor, pPROM, and PTB membranes compared to respective controls suggest MFs' resealing is compromised. Amnion epithelial cells in MFs have been observed undergoing epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Further, these cells showed proliferative and resealing properties of deepithelialized (nude/cell free) areas to stabilize membranes. At the healing edge of MFs, amnion mesenchymal cells exhibited a reverse phenomenon, mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). From these findings, we postulate that cellular transitions are essential for maintaining fetal membrane integrity. We
hypothesize that MFs are areas of membrane remodeling and their increased number and morphometry are associated with failure to remodel and dysfunctional membranes. Understanding intercellular and cell-matrix
interactions causing MFs' development and their resealing will help us to determine how oxidative stress (OS)
and inflammation can contribute to the persistence of MFs and dysfunctional membrane status in PTB and pPROM. Two specific aims to be tested are Specific Aim 1: To investigate the dynamic remodeling of the fetal membrane epithelium in an in vitro model of cell-free (nude) membranes during OS and infection / inflammation compared to normal conditions; Specific Aim 2: To determine cell migration, matrix degradation, and cellular transition associated with MFs' formation using a fetal membrane organ-on-a-chip approach. This multidisciplinary proposal combines cell and molecular biological and bioengineering approaches designed to overcome the limitations of classic 2D cell cultures by developing a fetal membrane-on-a-chip using organ-on-chip technologies. This model system will maintain multiple cell types in close proximity with constant dynamic interactions, similar to the conditions in utero. We will elucidate causative molecular mechanisms of (normal and abnormal) biologic MFs' formation and how they contribute to PTB and pPROM. Understanding cellular-level mechanisms will allow us to design strategies to minimize MFs' development to strengthen intrauterine cavities and reduce the risk of PTB and pPROM."

Cardiopulmonary arrest (CA) is a major cause of death/disability in the U.S. with poor prognosis and survival
rates. The current CA therapeutic challenges are physiologically complex because they involved hypoperfusion
[decreased cerebral blood flow, (CBF)], neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our long-term goal
is to identify these complex regulatory elements that ultimately control neuronal viability. In our pilot study, we
discovered that novel serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is highly expressed in brain NEURONS
that are susceptible to ischemia (e.g., hippocampus and cortex). Inhibition of SGK1 via GSK 650394 (specific
inhibitor) alleviated CA-induced hypoperfusion, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial deficits, neuronal cell death,
and learning/memory deficits; this suggests SGK1 may play a detrimental role during ischemia. The primary
goal of this proposal is to inhibit SGK1 and utilize pharmacological (specific SGK1 inhibitor) and cell type
(neuron)-specific genetic approaches (e.g., shRNA) in our well-established rodent models of CA to answer the
central hypothesis: SGK1 expression is enhanced after CA, which leads to hypoperfusion,
neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunctional, and neurological deficits. In Aim 1, the role of SGK1 in
CA-induced hypoperfusion will be investigated. How SGK1 causes CA-induced hypoperfusion will be determined
via two-photon microscopy and laser speckle contrast imaging (Aim 1a and 1c). Furthermore, we will identify
potential vasoactive mediators that contribute to SGK1-mediated hypoperfusion using PCR, capillary-based
immunoassay, and ELISA (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, we will determine if SGK is responsible for neuroinflammation and
mitochondrial dysfunction after CA by exploring three objectives. First, how SGK1 affects microglia
activation/polarization and astrogliosis following CA, which will be investigated via brain histology and flow
cytometry (Aim 2a). Second, inhibition of SGK1 alleviated CA-induced neuroinflammation will be analyzed via
protein chip assay (Aim 2b). Third, the harmful effects of SGK1 on mitochondrial ion homeostasis and energetics
will be studied by Seahorse respirometry and microspectrofluorometry, respectively (Aim 2c and 2d). In Aim 3,
we will evaluate the therapeutic potential of the SGK1 inhibitor against CA-induced neuronal cell death and
neurological deficits. Utilizing brain histology (Cresyl violet and Fluoro-Jade C staining) (Aim 3a) and behavioral
trials (Y-maze and novel object recognition test) (Aim 3b), the role of SGK1 in neurological deficits will be
determined. Successful completion of the proposed study will reveal the fundamental roles of SGK1 in neuronal
survival/death in cerebral ischemia-related diseases. Since the FDA has approved over 46 kinase-related drugs
for the treatment of various diseases, our study will be promptly translated into human clinical trials for the
patients suffering from CA."
10796924,"The human lens must maintain transparency over many decades and, to do so without a blood supply, the lens
maintains a fluid microcirculation system (MCS) to deliver nutrients throughout the tissue. Although the influx of
water, ions, and nutrients occurs at the anterior and posterior poles via the lens sutures and fluid outflow occurs
toward the equatorial efflux zone, the molecular details of how the MCS is established and maintained with age
are not well understood. It is, however, agreed that spatial differences in the expression and functionality of
channels and transporters are critical to the generation of ion and fluid circulation. In this application we focus
on lens aquaporins (AQPs) that we hypothesize play important roles in generating the lens MCS by establishing
differences in water permeability in influx, outflow, and efflux zones. Aquaporin-0 (AQP0), the most abundant
lens membrane protein, has reported roles in lens fiber cell adhesion, in basal water permeability, and in fiber
cell organization and, as such, is vital for the development and maintenance of lens transparency. A second
aquaporin, AQP5, is also present in lens fiber cells and can act as a regulated water channel since mechanical
tension can alter AQP5 subcellular localization in fiber cells of the anterior pole and equator to presumably
dynamically regulate water permeability. The long-term goal of our research is to understand how lens protein
modifications that occur during development, aging, and cataractogenesis help establish or alter the MCS
thereby leading to lens transparency or opacification. In the context of the microcirculation system, we
hypothesize that AQP posttranslational modifications and AQP-lipid interactions are important molecular
mechanisms used to modulate AQP functionality in the influx, outflow, and efflux zones. To test our hypotheses,
we will employ advanced quantitative proteomics, native mass spectrometry, multi-modal imaging methods, and
water permeability assays to obtain a molecular level understanding of how the structures and functions of lens
AQPs change in influx, outflow, and efflux zones. Further, we will examine changes in AQP modifications and
subcellular localization in organ cultured lenses exposed to stimuli that either dynamically regulate lens water
transport or compromise the ability of the MCS to maintain lens transparency. This suite of methods will be
applied to lens to test three hypotheses: 1) that water influx into the lens is increased by AQP5 membrane
trafficking in the anterior suture region of the lens, 2) that AQPs direct intracellular water flow toward the lens
equator in the outflow zone, and 3) that AQP5 trafficking to the membrane in the efflux zone dynamically
regulates the MCS in response to mechanical tension, and oxidative or osmotic stress; stresses that mimic age
related nuclear and diabetic cataract, respectively. We expect to provide a new mechanistic understanding of
the roles of AQPs and their modifications in maintaining lens transparency. With this in-depth understanding,
strategies for the development of novel therapies to delay the onset and progression of lens cataract can be
envisioned."
10796926,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer related morbidity and mortality in the U.S.
With the increasing use of computed tomography scans and lung cancer screening, tumors are increasingly
being detected at stage I disease, conferring a greater than 70% likelihood of cure. Surgery has been the
traditional treatment for stage I NSCLC. However, population-based studies demonstrate a rapid increase in
stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) over the past decade. Retrospective studies comparing surgery and
SBRT, including several publications from our group, have been hampered by relatively small sample sizes, lack
of patient reported outcomes, and sparse information on comorbidities and cancer-related outcomes.
Consequently, a recent systematic review concluded, “there is a need to compare both treatments in large
prospective trials”. Unfortunately, multiple attempted randomized controlled trials comparing surgery to SBRT
have failed to accrue and closed prematurely due to specialty bias and perceived lack of equipoise. Furthermore,
our previous work has demonstrated that individual patient characteristics are crucial in the choice of therapy. In
the absence of prospective comparative studies, treatment allocation is largely directed by institutional
experience, retrospective data, and provider opinion. The lack of evidence-based treatment allocation in patients
with stage I lung cancer remains a critical unmet need. To address this fundamental gap in knowledge, we will
perform a prospective, pragmatic, multi-center cohort study to compare the effectiveness of surgery and SBRT
for stage I NSCLC. This pragmatic study design is ideally suited to provide actionable results.
Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of surgery versus stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) on
stakeholder selected short and long-term outcomes in patients with clinical stage I lung cancer. Aim 1a:
To compare 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) between surgery and SBRT. We will compare long-term DFS
using propensity score matched cohorts. We hypothesize that SBRT will lead to fewer and less severe treatment-
related complications, while surgery will result in longer DFS. Aim 1b: To compare patient reported outcomes
(PRO) between surgery and SBRT. We will compare short and long-term PRO in propensity-matched cohorts
using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. We hypothesize that SBRT will result
in better short-term PRO with equivalent long-term PRO.
Aim 2: To develop and validate prediction models for treatment outcomes for an individual patient with
stage I lung cancer. In prospectively assembled cohorts of patients undergoing surgery or SBRT for stage I
lung cancer, we will predict long-term DFS and PRO for an individual patient using regression techniques. These
models will be validated and presented as a web-based tool for patients with stage I NSCLC. Our proposal will
create a benchmark for personalized treatment allocation in lung cancer and provide actionable results to
improve care for Stage I NSCLC patients."

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is initiated by a number of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary insults.
However, the lung damage becomes persistent despite treatment of the underlying etiology. Therefore, failure
of inflammation resolution is an underlying abnormality that drives the development of ARDS. Multiple pathways
have been established that drive inflammatory cell death. However, apoptosis is under recognized in its ability
to cause inflammation. Indeed, apoptotic death of the lung epithelium is a prominent feature in ARDS and
blocking apoptosis has proven beneficial in various models of ARDS.
Apoptotic cells must be efficiently cleared by phagocytes to prevent secondary necrosis of the dying cell. Thus,
apoptotic death is quiescent only when the cell is removed by a process called efferocytosis. Inefficient clearance
augments inflammation damages tissue leading to further apoptotic death creating a positive feedback loop of
unrelenting inflammation, such as we see in ARDS. We have found that syndecan-1 regulates lung inflammation
after influenza infection by promoting efferocytosis of apoptotic epithelium. Therefore, the central hypothesis of
this proposal is that syndecan-1 expression by the lung epithelium facilitates apoptotic cells clearance by
macrophages thereby promoting the resolution of lung inflammation after influenza injury.
This multi-PI proposal brings together two longstanding collaborators that have studied the role of syndecan-1
in lung injury. Dr. Chen has a research program primarily based on understanding the epithelial immune
response in the lungs after injury whereas Dr. Parks' program focuses on macrophage biology. Merging the

10798119,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in the bone marrow (BM), are quiescent, can self-renew, and generate
all lineages of the hematopoietic system. A coherent picture of how steady-state function and homeostatic
responses of HSCs are regulated has not emerged yet, however. Furthermore, although progress has been
made in this area, reliable renewal or even maintenance of HSCs in vitro remains challenging, but would have
major translational implications. A particular gap is our understanding of the organellar cell biology of HSCs. One
organelle of which role in HSCs is unclear is the mitochondrion. Preferential use of glycolysis in stem cells
suggests that mitochondrial respiration is more dispensable for HSCs than for progenitors. These findings raise
the question whether mitochondria play roles in HSCs that are not directly related to ATP production, such as
intermediary metabolism, epigenetics, apoptosis and intracellular calcium handling. Mitochondria dynamics, the
fusion and fission of mitochondria, play a central role in the coordination of mitochondrial function. The fusion
machinery consists of two partially redundant and interacting outer membrane GTPases, mitofusins (MFN) 1
and 2, and the inner membrane GTPase, OPA1. We observed that mitofusins show redundant and non-
redundant as well as cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic roles that profoundly and specifically impact HSCs. We also
found that HSCs are endowed with elevated mitochondrial mass and attenuated mitophagy, and that all mitofusin
mutants with severe phenotypes also had reduced mitochondrial mass in HSCs, but not in mature hematopoietic
cells. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and harness mitochondrial dynamics
to achieve more efficient maintenance of HSC in vitro."
10798123,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human facial morphology varies both within and among populations, and this variation is driven in large part by
genetic factors. Over the past seven years, gene mapping studies have identified numerous chromosomal
regions associated with normal-range facial variation. Using advanced methods of biological shape analysis,
our group recently uncovered over 200 such regions. Despite our success, these signals collectively explain
only a small fraction of the heritable variation in facial shape, suggesting that much of the genetic architecture
underlying human facial shape is yet to be discovered. A more complete understanding of this genetic
architecture may provide insights into the mechanisms that control how the human face forms, offer insights
into the etiology of craniofacial syndromes and birth defects, and eventually lead the way toward genetically-
informed personalized therapeutic interventions for craniofacial surgery and orthodontics. Critically, we also
lack knowledge about which genetic variants are functionally active at the implicated chromosomal regions or
which genes they even target, limiting our ability to design future studies to sort out the biological mechanisms
involved in building faces. The current proposal has three aims designed to significantly advance our
understanding of human facial genetics: (1) we will perform a series of high-throughput experiments designed
to delineate functional variants from our gene-mapping studies that drive craniofacial gene expression; (2) we
will leverage new sources of data to bolster the statistical power of our gene-mapping efforts, paving the way
for the discovery of new genetic pathways and a deeper understanding of the complex genetic networks and
interactions that underlie variation in facial features; and (3) by applying innovative image processing and
morphometric modeling techniques, we will utilize a large longitudinal dataset of over 11,000 adolescents with
genetic markers and craniofacial images available at multiple timepoints to scan the genome for variants that
impact key aspects of facial growth, such as timing of maturation and rate of change. Understanding the
genetic basis of these growth traits has potential clinical relevance for fields like craniofacial surgery and
orthodontics, where an individual’s facial growth trajectory can be an important factor in personalized treatment
planning. By connecting genotypes to facial phenotypes and subsequently delineating functional variants, this
project promises to fill gaps in our knowledge about the genetic basis of human facial traits and offer novel
insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying both normal and abnormal facial development."

PROJECT 2
 Androgen receptor (AR), is essential for normal prostate development where it acts mainly as a tumor
suppressor. In prostate cancer (PCa), AR transitions to a potent oncogene by supporting the survival of cancer
cells. ID4, a helix loop helix (HLH) transcriptional regulator, is tumor suppressor that is epigenetically silenced
in PCa and PCa cell lines DU145, C-81 and PC3. We have shown that in Id4-/- mice and in ID4 depleted PCa
cell line LNCaP ((LNCaP(-)ID4)), ID4: a) attenuates prostate development, b) promotes PIN by attenuating tumor
suppressors (PTEN, p53, NKX3.1) and promoting tumor promoters (Myc, Id1, pAKt and Sox9) without altering
AR expression, c) AR is re-directed from occupying promoters of tumor suppressors (NKX3.1) to tumor
promoters (FKBP51 and MYC), d) promotes tumorigenicity in castrated nude mice (CRPC phenotype) and e)
promotes the expression AMACR (PCa Marker) and, e) promotes stem cell phenotype/ markers (sca1 in Id4-/-
mice, ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3, CD133/ 44, Nanog and SOX2 in LNCaP(-)ID4 cells).
 Because tumor regenerating prostate cancer stem (PCSC) cells play a role in therapy resistance and
progression to advanced PCa, targeting AR in PCSC in an ID4 depleted background may be a promising and
effective strategy to combat CRPC. However, the molecular mechanism, by which ID4 cross-talks with AR and
regulates the stem cell population is not known. Our hypothesis for this proposal, is “inactivation of ID4
promotes stem cell like properties and CRPC via redirecting androgen receptor activity that fuels
aggressive growth”. The hypothesis will be addressed by: Aim1: Investigate the role of ID4 in regulating PCa
stemness and Aim2: Investigate the molecular mechanism by which loss of ID4 promotes CRPC.
 We will address the underlying mechanism by which ID4 is epigenetically silenced in PCa through a crosstalk
between PRMT1 and EZH2 and how loss of ID4 promotes stem cell phenotype. The underlying mechanism and
whether these stem cells are castration resistant, are regenerative, clonogenic and forms tumor that maintains
castration resistance will be the focus of Aim1. We have demonstrated that inactivation of ID4 could lead to
CRPC through multiple pathways including up-regulation pAKT and AR co-chaperone FKBP52. The majority of
CRPC maintain AR-dependent signaling as evident by re-elevation of PSA. Hence the role of ID4 in regulating
AR activity appears significant in context of CRPC (The AR cistrome, SA2).
 Loss of ID4 leads to the convergence of multiple oncogenic pathways which can be exploited for developing
a combinatorial therapeutic strategy by:1) up-regulating ID4 by blocking epigenetic pathways (e.g. PRMT1), 2)
targeting the pro-survival/ anti-apoptotic AKT pathway by blocking pAKT and 3) targeting the CRPC pathway by
blocking androgen receptor co-chaperone FKBP52. The targeted pathways individually are well documented in
PCa and the small molecules targeting these pathways have an established clinical profile. However, the
combinatorial strategy which converges on ID4-Stem cell-AR pathway is novel to this proposal (Aim 2)."

PROJECT 3
Prostate cancer with a metastatic castration-resistant phenotype is a leading cause of cancer-related
deaths among men in the United States and worldwide, affecting African Americans disproportionately. The
cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to this deadly disease remain poorly understood,
obstructing the development of an effective therapy that prolongs patients’ survival while preserving the
quality of life. The primary goal of this research will be to uncover the mechanism of molecular and functional
interactions between the transcriptional regulatory protein YAP1 and SCML2, a subunit of the Polycomb
repressive complex 1, and to demonstrate that YAP1 and SCML2 cooperate to contribute to invasive
prostate cancer. Using mass spectroscopy-based proteomic approaches, we have identified SCML2 as a
binding partner of the nuclear YAP1 protein complexes from prostate cancer cell lines. Our data showed that
androgen hormone signaling regulates YAP1 and SCML2 interaction in castration-sensitive and castration-
resistant cell lines. Our studies also showed that silencing SCML2 in castration-sensitive cells resulted in
androgen-independent cell growth and led to enzalutamide resistance. However, silencing SCML2 in
castration-resistant cells had the opposite effect when exposed to androgen. In addition, our data showed that
castration-resistant cells express significantly elevated SCML2 compared to castration-sensitive prostate
cancer cells, and the SCML2 gene amplification could contribute to advanced disease. These
observations support the overarching hypothesis that SCML2 and YAP1 cooperate to contribute to invasive
prostate cancer. The primary objectives of this study are to uncover the mechanism of biochemical and
functional interactions between the Hippo pathway effector YAP1 and Polycomb group protein SCML2 in
prostate cancer cells (Aim 1) to determine how altered-SCML2 activity changes the growth behaviors of
prostate tumor cell ex vivo and in vivo (Aim 2), and to evaluate the pattern of SCML2 expression in
prostate cancer disparity tissues and correlated the results with the clinical progression of prostate cancer and
race (Aim 3). This study will provide critical mechanistic insights into the functional and molecular interactions
between the YAP1 and SCML2 regulating cell migration and metastasis. Thus, uncovering a new
mechanism of the aggressive disease may benefit patient care through improved disease surveillance
and targeted selection of patients for more effective targeted therapy, which may reduce disparities in prostate
cancer mortality among men from African American communities. Lastly, YAP1 and SCML2 play a critical
role in the biology of many cancers with poor outcomes, and therefore, knowledge gained through this
research can benefit other cancers with poorer outcomes."

 Molds cause devastating infections in diverse patient populations worldwide. The most life-threatening of
these diseases are invasive mold infections (IMIs) which primarily affect immune compromised individuals
including those undergoing chemotherapy, long term steroid treatment, and hemopoietic or solid organ transplant
patients. IMIs can be caused by a handful of environmental molds but the most common species is Aspergillus
fumigatus. Currently, there are three classes of antifungals used to treat IMIs; however, despite available
treatments, mortality rates remain unacceptably high, typically ~50% but reaching 80-100% for some mold
species and patient cohorts. One contributing factor to the high mortality rates is intrinsic resistance of some
mold species to some or all clinical antifungals. In addition, acquired antifungal resistance, particularly among A.
fumigatus isolates, is becoming a clinical problem worldwide.
 In the drug development space, antifungal drug screens often focus on yeast species. This is due in part
to the technical ease of handling these organisms in high-throughput settings. Yeast growth is tightly correlated
to optical density, facilitating large-format growth-based screens. In contrast, molds grow as filaments which
create a heterogenous culture of tangled cells whose optical density is not well correlated to biomass.
Additionally, the inability to handle these cultures with automated liquid handling devices creates additional
challenges in high throughput settings. However, the high mortality rates and limited activity of clinical antifungal
against molds warrants more focus on these organisms in antifungal drug screening.
 To address the need for mold-active antifungals, we developed and validated a high-throughput
compatible screening assay to screen directly with A. fumigatus. This luciferase-based assay measures the
release of the cytosolic enzyme, adenylate kinase (AK), as a readout for fungal cell lysis. Uniquely, when used
with A. fumigatus this assay can also detect compounds that inhibit germination through the suppression of
background AK release that occurs during normal germination and vegetative growth. Here, we propose a high-
throughput screen of a large library of synthetic, drug-like molecules for novel scaffolds with anti-mold activity
using our AK screening platform. Pilot large-format screens have already identified candidate molecules for
further development; thus, based on the scale and diversity of our proposed screen, we expect to identify
additional mold-active antifungals with novel mechanisms of action for preclinical development."
10809638,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human cell division is regulated at the G1/S transition before DNA is replicated. The primary drivers of cells
through the G1/S transition are the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6 in complex with D-type cyclins.
The goal of this project is to determine the mechanisms that Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes use to drive cell division.
This is important for cancer because Cdk4/6 activity is elevated in many cancers including breast cancers, brain
cancers, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and neuroblastoma tumors. Inhibiting Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 is therefore a
promising avenue for therapies targeting these cancers. Here, we propose to determine how Cyclin D-Cdk4/6
drives the G1/S transition. First, we will do this by identifying all the targets of Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 kinases in cells
using a chemical genetic approach. Second, we will determine the molecular mechanism Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 uses
to dock and phosphorylate its primary target, the retinoblastoma protein Rb. In preliminary data, we discovered
that Cyclin D binds an alpha helix at the C-terminus of Rb. We now aim to determine the location on Cyclin D
that docks Rb’s C-terminal helix using a combination of in vitro biochemistry and structural biology approaches.
We propose to use knowledge of this docking interaction to develop a tool compound that disrupts the interaction
and arrests the cell cycle. This will allow testing of the importance of the interactions in cells and provides a
proof-of-principle that disrupting this interaction could be used in targeted cancer therapeutics. We will pursue
two directions to identify a tool compound. First, we will develop a peptide inhibitor based on Rb’s C-terminal
helix. Second, we will screen a small molecule library using a FRET assay. Taken together, the proposed
experiments will provide an in-depth analysis of the Cyclin D-Rb interaction and will determine how it drives cell
division. The broader impact of this study of the Cyclin D molecular docking mechanism and identification of
Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 substrates may be the identification of new small molecules that improve cancer therapy."
10809641,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In human cancers, the gene coding for the Rb tumor suppressor is frequently silenced, deleted, mutated, or
functionally inactivated by phosphorylation by over-expressed Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 kinase complexes. Due to its
importance in cancer, the Cyclin D-Cdk4/6-Rb axis is the target of FDA-approved Cdk4/6 inhibitors. The
underlying assumption of this effort is that Cdk4/6 inhibition leads to Rb re-activation and tumor suppression in
cancer cells where the gene coding for Rb has not been disabled. While a large number of studies have
investigated the consequences of Rb loss of function, few studies have investigated the consequences of Rb re-
activation in cells, even though this re-activation is highly relevant in the clinic in patients treated with Cdk4/6
inhibitors.
Here, we propose to tackle the central question of the mechanisms by which Rb activity can suppress cancer
progression using a combination of genetic, cell biological, biochemical, and structural approaches. First, we will
determine the effects of Rb re-activation in Rb-inactive cancer cells in vivo using a novel inducible mouse allele
in which Rb function can be turned on and off. Using this allele, we will re-activate Rb in tumor cells to determine
the molecular consequences of Rb re-introduction as a way to better understand how Rb wild-type cancer cells
respond to Cdk4/6 inhibitors. Second, we will investigate the possible tumor suppressor role of the Rb family
members p107 and p130 in response to Cdk4/6 inhibitors in cancer cells that are mutant for Rb. The goal is to
identify ways to enhance cell cycle inhibition by p107 and p130. Third, we will investigate post-translational
modifications that control Rb interactions with E2F and its tumor suppressive effects in cells, including acetylation
events that functionally interact with phosphorylation of Rb. The identification of such key residues that are
modified in Rb may open new avenues of research to prevent its functional inactivation or enhance its tumor
suppressive activity.
Taken together, these experiments will provide an in-depth analysis of the functional activation of Rb and its
family members in contexts relevant to cancer and may point to new effector mechanisms downstream of and
parallel to Rb. Ultimately, these experiments will help identify new ways to enhance the tumor suppressive effects
of FDA-approved Cdk4/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib, ribociclib, or abemaciclib."
10809647,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gain-of-function mutations of oncogenes and loss-of-function mutations of tumor suppressor genes drive the
initiation and progression of human cancer. These genes also play critical roles in normal development and
cellular differentiation. Genetic or epigenetic alterations in the Rb pathway are required for the initiation and
progression of most types of human cancer. The three inter-related projects in this program will address major
outstanding fundamental questions about the functioning of key proteins in the Rb pathway: Cyclin D-Cdk4/6
oncoproteins that regulate Rb by phosphorylation, the Rb family of tumor suppressors that act as transcriptional
regulators, and the E2F family of transcription factors that interact with and are directly regulated by the Rb family
proteins and control the transcription of genes important for cell cycle progression. A major goal of this program
project is to investigate the Rb pathway using an interdisciplinary approach. The major goal of this Core is to
provide an administrative framework to help implement the scientific goals and disseminate the results of the
proposed experiments.
Specifically, the Administrative Core will have three goals. The first goal will be to promote scientific interactions
among the Project Leaders and laboratory members involved in the three main Projects and two Scientific Cores.
The second goal will be to provide scientific and financial guidance and oversight, including in conjunction with
an Internal Advisory Committee and an External Scientific Advisory Board. The third goal will be to facilitate
communication among the members of the Projects and Cores themselves and to the greater scientific
community and the public. To achieve these goals, the Leader for this Administrative Core, will work closely with
the Leaders of each of the Projects and Scientific Cores. Regular scientific interactions to exchange ideas and
results, feedback from members of the internal advisory committee and the external scientific advisory board,
and specific metrics to monitor progress, will all be critical to help uncover novel fundamental mechanisms
underlying cell cycle progression."
10807815,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Hypertension in pregnancy is highly prevalent and increasing in the United States, and 40% of maternal deaths
involve women with hypertension. In adults from racial/ethnic minority groups, hypertension is two-fold more
prevalent and leads to higher rates of preeclampsia and stroke, thus resulting in devastating health
consequences in the infant and mother alike. The time required for frequent in-person visits, inadequate
counseling, and the asymptomatic nature of hypertension are major barriers to effective blood pressure (BP)
control in pregnant women. These issues can be addressed through home BP monitoring (HBPM), which holds
the potential to reduce preventable and devastating clinical events while also proven to reduce racial inequities
in pregnant women. Obstetric societies recommend HBPM for all pregnant women with hypertension, but our
pilot work suggests that rates of HBPM counseling and uptake are low. With the increasing use of mobile health
apps in pregnancy, there is an opportunity for digital health approaches with culturally appropriate storytelling to
improve HBPM and allow pregnant women with hypertension to learn from others with similar lived experiences.
This K23 Award proposes to develop Moms@Home, a digital health approach to support HBPM in pregnant
women with hypertension. Moms@Home will integrate storytelling videos with a Social Cognitive Theory-based
proven approach to support behavior change and address the cultural and literacy needs of a diverse population
of pregnant women. Incorporating storytelling with a successful digital health approach may increase the
adoption of HBPM. Guided by Patient and Clinician Advisory Groups, Aim 1 will adapt the existing mobile health
app MyDataHelpsTM to create Moms@Home for pregnant women with hypertension by incorporating stories from
women with similar lived experiences. Aim 2 will refine the Moms@Home components with obstetric caregiver
and patient interviews. Aim 3 will pilot test the Moms@Home approach in pregnant women with hypertension,
enriched in those from racial/ethnic minority groups, to assess HBPM adherence, feasibility, and acceptability.
Beyond the research plan, the K23 will provide Dr. Kovell with advanced research training, protected time, and
mentoring to become an independent physician-scientist focused on improving outcomes for pregnant women
with hypertension. Dr. Kovell will be guided by experienced mentors with expertise in digital health and study
design (Dr. McManus), behavior change (Dr. Lemon), peripartum/women’s health (Dr. Moore Simas), storytelling
and health equity (Dr. Allison), and biostatistics (Dr. Person). Her advisory team are experts in hypertension,
clinical trials, and informatics. In addition, her comprehensive career development plan will lead to a Master of
Science in Clinical Investigation degree and expertise in digital health, behavior change, and clinical trials. This
K23 award will set the stage for Dr. Kovell’s future R01 application examining digital behavioral health
interventions on BP control for pregnant women with hypertension. This innovative and scalable proposal has
tremendous potential to positively impact and support women with hypertension through healthy pregnancies."
10807838,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental health conditions in
childhood, and nearly half of all youth with ADHD have at least one parent who also meets criteria for the
disorder. Intergenerational ADHD is a significant risk factor for reduced skill use and poor child outcomes
following evidence-based behavioral parent training (BPT) programs. Given that BPT is predicated on
consistent, in vivo use of BPT skills, efforts to reduce parental ADHD-related barriers to BPT skill use may
have significant public health implications. Incorporating Cognitive and Behavioral Therapy (CBT) strategies
shown to improve adult ADHD symptoms and executive dysfunction into BPT programs may reduce such
barriers. Mobile health (mHealth) adjunct interventions are another promising approach to improve BPT skill
use, as personalized CBT-based supports and temporally relevant reminders may also reduce several of the
most common barriers. Yet, no existing BPT program includes these augmentations. This K23 seeks to adapt
an evidence-based BPT program to reduce skill use barriers and increase skill use among parents with ADHD
by incorporating (a) in-session modules on adult ADHD CBT strategies and (b) a smartphone-based app that
provides timely reminders and CBT-based supports. The intervention, Executive Function Enhanced Caregiver
Training Skills (EFECTS), will be developed using an iterative, stakeholder driven approach that uses Human
Centered Design (HCD) strategies to incorporate end-user feedback at all stages of development to improve
fit, outcomes, and implementation. A pilot RCT will compare EFECTS to an existing BPT program.
 Candidate: My early research examined the underlying executive function deficits associated with ADHD,
and my long-term career goal is to design theory-driven interventions based on our understanding of the
etiological underpinnings of the disorder. As treatment research represents a shift in my research interests, I
require formal, mentored training in intervention design and evaluation. Through this mentored career
development award, I will learn the skills necessary to become an independent intervention researcher,
including 1) mechanism-focused intervention development, 2) mHealth applications to improve parenting
intervention skill use, and 3) methods to improve intervention fit, implementation, dissemination, and effects.
My mentorship team is well-suited to provide the training necessary for me to become a successful intervention
researcher and consists of Dr. Sharlene Wolchik (primary mentor; expertise: theory-based parenting
intervention development; RCT implementation), Dr. Linda Pfiffner (co-primary mentor; expertise: developing
BPT programs for ADHD), Dr. Mary Solanto (co-mentor; expertise: designing CBT interventions for adults with
ADHD and executive dysfunction), Dr. David MacKinnon (advisor; expertise: analyzing treatment mechanisms
and outcomes), Dr. Aaron Lyon (advisor; expertise: HCD, implementation science), and Dr. Oliver Lindhiem

10809567,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is a critical mechanical defense mechanism of the human respiratory system.
Poor MCC is a fundamental feature of many inherited and acquired respiratory diseases including primary
ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), asthma, chronic bronchitis, and cystic fibrosis (CF). Due to the complex organization
of the lung, it is largely unknown how defects of the ciliary machinery change functional MCC and how regional
variability of airway epithelial structure, including cell type proportions and ciliary beat parameters, affect local
MCC pathophysiology. These knowledge gaps dramatically impair our ability to predict the degree of pulmonary
dysfunction imparted by specific ciliary defects, and to understand the airway region-specific onset observed in
many lung diseases. While impaired MCC is a pre-determined functional consequence of PCD and other
chronic lung diseases, to date, there is no established in vitro model that is able to accurately predict the
relationship between genotype, cilia motility, MCC, and respiratory phenotype and, therefore, many
genotype-phenotype relationships remain unexplained. Our transdisciplinary research program is designed
to address an unmet need to understand how a) region-specific airway organization and b) ciliopathy-
causing genotypes, impact MCC. To achieve this we will complete specific aims designed to: 1) use ex vivo
lung tissues, that retain their in vivo epithelial organization, as models of ciliated airway epithelia to
comprehensively evaluate biomechanical structure-function relationships in large and small airways (Aim 1); 2)
use established in vitro models of the human tracheo-bronchial (large) airways to determine a minimal set of
structural and functional parameters that are conserved between in vitro and ex vivo ciliated tissues (Aim 2); 3)
apply state-of-the-art physics-based computational approaches to develop an in silico model that will be able
to predict structure-function relationships of ciliated tissues (Aim 3) and 4) use the minimal set of parameters
that define functional MCC in both in vitro and ex vivo models as input into the in silico model to predict regional-
specific changes in MCC due to ciliary defects in both large and small airways (All Aims). Our specific objectives
build to our long-term goal of combining in vitro and in silico models as a preclinical, precision medicine
tool for evaluating small molecule or gene-editing therapeutics toward more targeted and efficient
treatment regimens of pulmonary diseases characterized by poor mucociliary clearance."
10886824,"Project Summary / Abstract
Aortic disease is an important contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and sudden death. Key discoveries,
including identification of the causal gene for Marfan’s syndrome (FBN1), have advanced our knowledge of
syndromic aneurysm and dissection, but to date there remains insufficient information on sporadic thoracic aortic
disease. For example, despite growing knowledge of the importance of aortic disease, there is no guideline for
screening for ascending aortic disease, and no therapy to treat its underlying molecular mechanisms. While there
is likely some overlap between thoracic and abdominal aortic disease, they are embryologically distinct and likely
have different genetic and clinical risk factors.
In Dr. Pirruccello’s preliminary work, he developed an automated deep learning model to quantify the diameter
of the thoracic aorta using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). He applied the model in the UK
Biobank and conducted a genome-wide association study for the diameter of ascending and descending thoracic
aorta in nearly 40,000 participants. These results cemented the feasibility of the approach of (1) training deep
learning models to extract biologically relevant information from imaging, and (2) conducting genetic analyses
on these deep learning model-based phenotypes. This now paves the way for a more comprehensive analysis
of additional aortic traits, and downstream evaluation of genetic risk factors for both thoracic and abdominal
aortic disease.
First, Dr. Pirruccello proposes to develop models for additional aortic traits including thoracic aortic strain and
distensibility, and abdominal aortic diameter. Second, after developing additional models to extract those
features, Dr. Pirruccello proposes to conduct genetic analyses on these traits in the UK Biobank, elucidating the
common and rare genetic variation that leads to variability in the aorta’s size and distensibility at several levels.
Third, he proposes to produce polygenic scores, permitting modeling of the clinical and genetic risk for
abnormalities in aortic size and distensibility that may predispose to aortic aneurysm and dissection.
This work will take place in the Division of Cardiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and at the Broad
Institute of MIT and Harvard. Dr. Pirruccello will perform this research under the mentorship of Dr. Patrick Ellinor,
the Director of the Cardiovascular Disease Initiative at the Broad Institute, and Dr. Mark Lindsay, an expert in
genetic aortic disease at the Massachusetts General Hospital Thoracic Aortic Center.
Dr. Pirruccello’s goal is to become a computational cardiovascular geneticist with expertise in machine learning.
He is dedicated to becoming an independent investigator and to use the research performed for the K08 as a
springboard for an R01."
10807393,"Adolescence is a critical period of neural maturation that lasts into the mid-20s in humans, ages
during which most U.S. military enlistments occur. Heavy episodic drinking is highly prevalent in
this age group, particularly among young military personnel. Recent evidence indicates
Veterans that engaged in early adolescent binge drinking (initiation before age 14) have a
higher prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUD), substance use disorders, depression, and
stress. Risks for later development of these affective disorders in Veterans can be further
exacerbated by acute stressors, suggesting compounding mechanisms between stress and
alcohol on affective networks. However, this relationship is poorly understood and
understudied, despite its important translational implications for Veterans' health. Recent
studies in both humans and animal models have shown that adolescent/young-adult intermittent
ethanol (AIE) exposure results in enduring deficits in brain function and behavior that persist
well into adulthood and possibly for the life of the individual. We, and others, have shown these
enduring effects of AIE to include deficits in neural, glial, and neuroimmune functions in several
brain regions that are known to drive anxiety-like and other affective behaviors. Our current
preliminary data demonstrate that animals with a history of adolescent alcohol exposure are
hypersensitive to the effects of stress, inducing anxiety-like behavior. Thus, adolescent/young
adult alcohol exposure may alter limbic brain structures that predispose individuals to stress-
induced affective dysregulation long after the ethanol exposure. This suggests that Veterans
with a history of early heavy drinking may be at elevated risk for stress-induced affective
disorders. Therefore, we propose three objectives investigating rodent behavior, markers of
neurocircuitry, and synaptic function. First we will conduct rodent behavioral studies to evaluate
the anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors caused by the combination of adolescent ethanol
exposure and adult stress, their longevity, and possible pharmacological amelioration. We will
assess the role for gabapentin (Neurontin) to reverse the anxiety phenotype induced by
adolescent alcohol and adult stress and characterize the longevity of the adolescent ethanol
exposure and adult stress phenotype by testing for anxiety-like and depressive-like behavior 3
or 9 weeks after the final stressor. The second aim of the project is to identify neural circuits and
mechanisms underlying this phenotype. We propose to use transgenic Fos-LacZ rats, to assess
unbiased whole-brain anxiety-induced activation and functional connectivity to identify novel
circuits of interest involved in the etiology of the phenotype. We will investigate the
chemogenetic inhibition of the mPFC and vHipp to attenuate the anxiety phenotype. We also
propose to explore neuroimmune, neurogenesis and neurodegeneration markers, using
immunohistochemistry, in the mPFC and vHipp, and their reversal by systemic gabapentin
treatment. The third aim seeks to identify specific synaptic mechanisms underlying the
interaction of adolescent ethanol exposure and adult stress in the mPFC and vHipp via
electrophysiology and their astrocytic chemogenetic reversal. Findings from these studies will
provide clinically relevant information to inform Veterans' healthcare. Results may lead to better
methods of screening patients for mental health needs and lead to targeted treatments for
stress-related anxiety disorders that are prominent in the Veteran population."
10810992,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hospitals across the United States are increasingly relying on physicians and advanced practice providers who
care for hospitalized patients (hospitalists). Hospitalists provide critical services and face a variety of stressors,
including unprecedented work conditions, exposures to highly infectious diseases, high patient volumes, and
unpredictable work demands. These factors contribute to high levels of job stress, which in turn can lead to
occupational burnout and mental health problems among hospitalists. In a recent single center study, 62% of
hospitalists reported burnout, with workload being the most commonly cited factor. This is concerning because
of the high reliance on hospitalists and the links between burnout and poor mental health and suboptimal patient
safety outcomes, and physician turnover. Burnout among US physicians has been estimated to cost the US
society $4.6 billion annually and health care organizations $7,600 per employed physician each year. However,
existing research on factors contributing to burnout and the consequences of burnout are primarily based on
physicians working in outpatient practices, leaving a critical gap in evidence-informed strategies to address
burnout among hospitalists and a lack of understanding of the cost of burnout to hospitals. Additionally, there
have been even fewer studies focused on hospitalist mental health. There is an urgent need to address the issue
burnout and poor mental health among hospitalists, as over one-third have considered leaving their current job,
threatening the sustainability of the workforce. Hospitalist turnover not only affects the long-term viability of the
field, but also has the potential to incur substantial costs for healthcare organizations; however, the costs are not
fully known. Determining the costs associated with hospitalist turnover is a crucial next step as it can inform
organizational decisions about work structure and environment and ultimately improve the well-being and
resilience of hospitalists. We will utilize a prospective multi-measure design to assess prevalence of burnout and
mental health and the relationship to hospitalist turnover using validated survey measures at 10 hospitals (Aim
1). Factors related to work structure and work environment that may contribute to burnout and poor mental health
among hospitalists will also be examined. We will gather data on the costs of hospitalist turnover by surveying
hospitalist group leaders at the 10 sites to model the probability of turnover, exploring relationships with burnout,
mental health status, and other covariates (Aim 2). A cost-consequence analysis will help leaders understand
the economic impact of turnover. The results of this study have the potential to inform policies and interventions
aimed at improving hospitalist well-being and reducing burnout and turnover in a significant portion of the
healthcare workforce. This is important because the results of this study will influence organizational decisions
about work structure and work environments that may be driving burnout and worsening mental health among
hospitalists and serve as a blueprint for other specialties."
10813063,"Untreated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) carries high morbidity, including musculoskeletal disability and
cardiovascular disease. Fortunately, in the past 15 years we have been able to control rheumatoid arthritis very
well by offering methotrexate alone, leflunomide alone, TNF blocker therapy, rituximab, or a combination of
methotrexate and a biologic (genetically-engineered proteins derived from human genes) therapy. At the same
time, it is known that biologic agents contribute to an increased incidence of serious infections, impaired host
response to vaccines, and a modest increase in risk for cancer. For certain, these agents block both
pathogenic autoimmune disease activity pathways as well as the beneficial host response and host defense
pathways. Furthermore, rheumatoid arthritis itself is associated with increased systemic immune activation and
risk for cardiovascular disease. Our data, and that of others, indicate that chronic immune activation likely
contributes to immune dysfunction, as measured by host response to neo-antigen and recall antigen
immunization, and that immune activation predicts cardiovascular disease in the setting of chronic infection.
We propose here to investigate determinants of immune health in the setting of auto immune disease by
testing the hypothesis that in rheumatoid arthritis chronic immune activation (elevated sCD14, sCD163,
TNFR2, TNF, autotaxin, and CD8/DC/monocyte activation) predicts immune dysfunction, as manifest by
impaired host response to vaccine, and cardiac disease. This relationship is interrupted by TNF blockade. Aim
1: Determine whether immune activation, as reflected by elevated levels of sCD14, sCD163, autotaxin,
TNFR2, IL6, CRP, dendritic cell activation and monocyte activation, predict immune health, as
measured by host response to neo-antigen and recall antigen vaccine in treated RA, and whether TNF
blocking treatment modifies this relationship. Aim 2: Determine the relation between immune
activation, endothelial function, coronary atherosclerosis in RA, and whether TNF blockade improves
both immune activation and cardiovascular surrogates."

 Diabetes incidence and prevalence remain at record highs in the United States. Understanding
diabetes disease progression and how it varies among America’s heterogeneous population is critical, given
unequal risks and outcomes for individuals of different racial/ethnic groups. Diabetes outcome prediction and
simulation models allow prediction of a person’s risk for diabetes complications and death. A recent review of
19 such models found that the majority—16 models—relied at least partly on transition functions developed by
the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). The UKPDS draws on data from a trial that began
in 1977 and involved 5100 patients who were followed for a total of 89,760 person years. The sample
consisted of mostly white British citizens. Only 8% and 10% of the UKPDS sample were Indian Asian and Afro-
Caribbean patients, respectively. The major racial/ethnic groups that make up the US population were not
included, and the variables studied in the UKPDS did not include any behavioral data. Long term, longitudinal
patient data on diabetes outcomes is costly to collect and all information on the UKPDS Outcomes Models has
been transparently reported and made publicly available. This has left the UKPDS risk models as the best
option for many risk engines, despite the small, dated and nondiverse sample that it is based on.
 Capitalizing on Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) Electronic Health Records (EHR) data
and legacy data systems, we identified over 527,000 patients with incident diabetes that were diagnosed and
treated at KPSC from 1993 to 2020. Our sample provides more than 4.4 million person-years of follow up.
More than 34,000 patients could be followed up for 21 or more years. The incident diabetes cohort from KPSC
is 34.4% Hispanic, 10.6% Asian and 12.7% African American or Black allowing us to update the risk equations
for all UKPDS outcome models by major race-ethnicity groups directly relevant for the U.S population. These
updated models will allow us to identify disparities in diabetes, assure statistical fairness, and improve
prediction of diabetes outcomes for diverse population groups.
 Because diabetes outcomes are largely influenced by health behaviors, we will also analyze behavioral
data captured in the EHR including data on exercise and referrals to diabetes and weight management
education classes. We will use cutting edge parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric models to re-
estimate risk equations using standard split sample cross-validation. We will report our methodology and
results transparently in the same format as the UKPDS. Our study will help to update existing simulation
models and support more timely and equitable clinical decision support and patient education."

Speech production difficulties affect most of the approximately 2 million people with aphasia in
the United States. Behavioral manifestations of speech impairment are heterogeneous and
imperfectly categorized with current systems for differential diagnosis. Though customized
treatment based on different speech profiles is widely believed to improve communicative
abilities and quality of life, evidence-based practice is limited due to a poorly defined diagnostic
process and uncertainty about which speech features distinguish among the core disorder
categories (apraxia of speech, aphasia with phonemic paraphasia, unilateral upper motor
neuron dysarthria), as they are defined behaviorally. In this project, we introduce a system for
quantitative documentation and analysis of clinically relevant speech characteristics. The
purpose of Aim 1 is to develop a new assessment for documenting speech profiles and
estimating their severity. We define boundaries between normal and impaired speech
production across key dimensions and metrics and identify a psychometrically sound and
clinically feasible test for estimating severity and characterizing multidimensional speech
profiles. In Aim 2, we develop a quantitative signature for speech profiles through empirically
focused analyses. By replacing existing diagnostic checklists with empirically validated profiles,
we expect project outcomes will resolve diagnostic confusion that has persisted for decades.
The link between diagnosis and intervention is developed in Aim 3, in order to establish a
foundation for precision intervention research. The project is expected to generate sound
assessment and diagnostic procedures and remove fundamental barriers to scientific discovery
concerning speech production difficulties after stroke."

and adverse birth outcomes including abortions, stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW), and infant
mortality. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs)
and intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) for the prevention of malaria in
pregnancy in endemic areas of Africa. However, there is concern for diminishing efficacy of these interventions
due to the spread of vector resistance to the pyrethroid insecticides used in LLINs and parasite resistance to
SP. Thus, there is an urgent need for new strategies for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy and improving
birth outcomes. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are now the standard treatment for malaria in
Africa. Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine (DP) is a fixed-dose ACT and an attractive alternative to SP for IPTp. DP
is highly efficacious, and the long half-life of piperaquine provides at least 4 weeks of post-treatment
prophylaxis. Recent randomized controlled trials from our group and others showed that, compared to IPTp
with SP, IPTp with DP dramatically reduced risks of malaria-specific outcomes but there were minimal
differences between the SP and DP groups in risks of adverse birth outcomes. The key question motivating
this proposal is why IPTp with either SP or DP is associated with similar risks of adverse birth outcomes
despite the far superior antimalarial activity of DP. The likely explanation is that SP, a broad-spectrum
antibiotic, protects against non-malarial causes of LBW and preterm birth. Our central hypothesis is that SP
improves birth outcomes independent of its antimalarial activity and that IPTp with a combination of SP+DP will
offer antimalarial and non-antimalarial benefits, thus providing superior prevention of adverse birth outcomes
compared to either drug used alone. To test this hypothesis we will conduct a double-blinded randomized
clinical trial in a rural area of Uganda with very high malaria transmission intensity, where our group already
has an established infrastructure for clinical research. Our specific aims will be (1) to compare the risk of
adverse birth outcomes among pregnant women randomized to receive monthly IPTp with SP vs. DP vs.
SP+DP, (2) To compare safety and tolerability of IPTp regimens among pregnant women randomized to
receive monthly IPTp with SP vs. DP vs. SP+DP, and (3) to compare risks of malaria-specific and non-malarial
outcomes among pregnant women randomized to receive monthly IPTp with SP vs. DP vs. SP+DP. This study
will be the first to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel combination of well-studied drugs for improving
birth outcomes and our findings may well have important policy implications, with a change in standard practice
for millions of pregnant women in Africa."
10813878,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed K23 Career Development Award will enable Dr. Kevin Clerkin to establish an independent
research career with expertise in the diagnosis and mechanism of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Dr.
Clerkin is a clinical advanced heart failure & transplant cardiologist, whose long-term goal is to optimize outcomes
of heart transplant recipients with respect to CAV. However, further training is required to achieve that goal. As
such, he has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors with individual expertise in: (1) transplant cardiology
(2) transplant immunology (3) clinical trial design and conduct (4) multimodality cardiac imaging and (5) research
dissemination. The career development plan includes formal coursework and mentored meetings in transplant
immunology and clinical trial design. Additionally, it involves activities and mentored experiences in career
development, research dissemination, and grantsmanship. Heart transplantation is the gold standard treatment
for end-stage heart failure, afflicting ~250,000 Americans annually. Given that CAV is the cause of death for up
to 1/3rd of transplant patients, it is necessary to improve our understanding and ability to diagnose CAV. The
primary objective of this K23 research training is to improve diagnostics for CAV and identify mechanisms
instigating early CAV in order to lay the groundwork for future studies to test therapies targeting that pathway.
This proposal consists of two interrelated studies to achieve this objective through clinical and translational
research. In the first, we hypothesize that physiology based screening (measuring coronary blood flow or
coronary flow reserve [CFR]) will improve the diagnosis of CAV over traditional angiography. We also
hypothesize that CFR measured on a non-invasive cardiac PET scan will correlate with CFR measured using a
pressure wire during coronary angiography, thereby allowing for a new primarily non-invasive screening
approach. In the second translational study we will leverage the careful CAV phenotyping of Study 1 to explore
clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) as a potential mechanism for early CAV. CHIP in adults
has been associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, mediated by increased inflammatory macrophage
chemokines and cytokines. While presently nothing is known of its impact on CAV, based on our previous work
identifying populations of macrophages surrounding coronary arteries of patients retransplanted for CAV, we
hypothesize that patients with CHIP will have an increased risk of CAV. Targeted gene sequencing will be
performed on peripheral blood samples from patients in our biobank in an effort to detect the presence of CHIP
and assess its association with early CAV. This K23 proposal will position Dr. Clerkin to accomplish his goals of
1) improving diagnosis of CAV, 2) identifying a novel target for optimizing CAV related patient outcomes post-
heart transplant, and 3) facilitating his development into an independent investigator in the field of transplant
cardiology."
10917005,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Efforts to curb the HIV epidemic in the United States (US) are impeded by suboptimal access and adherence to
antiretroviral therapy (ART), particularly among cis-gender Black women with HIV (CgBWH) in the Southern US
who have lower care linkage, engagement, and viral suppression, and higher mortality, than their male and White
female peers. Long-acting (LA) ART has the potential to transform the HIV treatment landscape, but the uptake
of LA-injectable (LAI) ART has been low due to multi-level challenges and the lack of tailored approaches for
key groups, including CgBWH. To help fill this gap, over the past six years our multidisciplinary team has led
mixed methods research on women’s LA ART interest, preferences, barriers, and facilitators. However, these
data were collected prior to LA ART approval, queried hypothetical use, and did not include young women or
focus on the South. To realize the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative “Treat” pillar, we must develop novel
approaches to optimize and tailor care linkage and ART adherence strategies for CgBWH. This proposal builds
on our existing multisite research infrastructure and robust academic-community partnerships to
explore Southern CgBWH preferences and implementation challenges in the era of approved LA ART; it
will integrate stakeholders’ needs and values to co-create prototype tools for education, referral, and linkage to
HIV treatment tailored to CgBWH. We will leverage the Study for Treatment And Reproductive Outcomes (STAR)
infrastructure, that is currently enrolling 1200 CgBWH in six Southern sites including urban and rural EHE
priority jurisdictions (AL, FL, GA, MS, NC, DC). To advance this work, we will use the Consolidated Framework
for Implementation Research and Human-centered design to inform our data collection, analyses and the
development of educational, referral, and linkage prototype toolkits to support CgBWH LA ART access and use.
In Aim 1 we will examine CgBWH preferences, facilitators, and barriers to LA ART uptake and novel delivery via
an ongoing LA ART survey in STAR (n=1200 CgBWH) and longitudinal interviews with 120 CgBWH who vary
by adherence, LA ART use, age, and rurality. In Aim 2 we will identify strategies to equitably scale up LA ART
for CgBWH through interviews with 60 HIV service providers including from community-based organizations
(CBOs) that vary by role, LA ART availability, funding, and rurality. In Aim 3 we will use human-centered design
approaches via a series of 3 workshops across four CBOs (2 rural, 2 urban) to integrate the voices of CgBWH
and HIV service providers and iteratively develop LA ART educational, referral and linkage tools that are tailored,
acceptable and feasible for CgBWH and a range of delivery sites. Given our established academic-community
research infrastructure, clinical leadership in LA ART programming, and expertise in HIV and women’s health,
qualitative methods and implementation science, we are well-positioned to rapidly implement this mixed methods
study and disseminate knowledge to all stakeholders, thus addressing the EHE “Treat” pillar in HIV hotspots."
10814390,"Project Summary: Dysfunction of GluN2B subunit in the N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) is implicated
in the physiopathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementia.
Pharmacological modulation of GluN2B subunit regulates synaptic plasticity and excitation, representing an attractive
therapeutic approach. PET is capable of quantifying biochemical processes in vivo, and a suitable GluN2B ligand
would substantially improve our understanding of GluN2B-based ionotropic glutamate signaling under
physiopathological conditions otherwise inaccessible by ex vivo (destructive) analysis. Quantification of GluN2B in
living brain by PET would provide the assessment of distribution, target engagement and dose occupancy of new
GluN2B-targeted neurotherapeutics. To date, no successful examples have been demonstrated to image GluN2B for
human use, representing a significant deficiency of our ability to study this target in vivo. Therefore, we propose to
develop a novel PET ligand that can overcome major drawbacks of previous attempts (low brain permeability / limited
target specificity / high lipophilicity), as the first translational imaging tool for drug discovery.
 Our first generation GluN2B-targeted ligand, [18F]N2B-0518 showed excellent potency, target selectivity and high
specific binding, but was discontinued due to low brain penetration and fast metabolism in vivo. In our next generation,
we successfully identified a lead molecule, N2B-94, which showed high potency and selectivity towards GluN2B over
all other NMDAR subunits. An 11C-isotopologue of N2B-94 was synthesized and preliminary PET imaging studies
confirmed that we have overcome the major obstacles for GluN2B ligand development by achieving: 1) high brain
uptake; 2) high target specificity, as well as well-improved in vivo stability. Though N2B-94 is a promising lead
molecule, PET ligands with higher brain penetration, improved potency and selectivity with proper brain kinetics are
sought for translational cross-species imaging studies to achieve optimal quantification of GluN2B in the living brain.
 On the basis that N2B-94 serves a validated hit for medicinal chemistry optimization, as specific goals, we will
design and prepare a series of GluN2B modulators amenable for labeling with 11C or 18F, and evaluate their ability to
quantify GluN2B activity and changes during drug challenge in rodents and nonhuman primates, as well as
autoradiography and biological validation in postmortem brain tissues from higher species. The impact of this work is
not only to develop the first potent and selective GluN2B PET ligand for the study of neurodegenerative disease-
related biological processes, but also ultimately, via PET imaging validation in higher species, to advance this ligand
for potential clinical translation and monitor target response of novel neurotherapeutics for neurodegenerative
diseases, including AD.
Relevance: This proposal has the potential to improve public health and help patients suffering from
neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, through the discovery of neurotherapeutics using GluN2B-selective
NMDAR PET ligands."
10814392,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Biobehavioral Human-Machine Co-adaptation of the Artificial Pancreas
Closed-loop control (CLC) is now transitioning to the clinical practice and one of the most advanced systems to
date–Control-IQ–uses an algorithm designed and tested by the previous research cycle of this project. With the
first generation of our CLC system now translated to the clinic, our objective is to design and test next-generation
CLC solutions, learning from the experience and utilizing the large database accumulated to date.
 Thus, we focus this project on the new concept of Adaptive Biobehavioral Control (ABC) – a first-in-class
 system that will use human-machine co-adaptation of CLC, recognizing both the necessity for the control
 algorithm to adapt to changes in human physiology, and the necessity for the person to adapt to CLC action.
To achieve its objectives, the ABC system will have two new components added to the current state-of-the art
Control-IQ: a Behavioral Adaptation Module (BAM) – a behavioral intervention deployed in a mobile app to assist
a person's adaptation to CLC by information and risk assessment primarily regarding meals and physical activity,
and a Physiologic Adaptation Module (PAM) – an automated procedure tracking risk status and changes in the
user's metabolic profile and acting in real time to adapt the CLC algorithm's insulin control parameters.
Using these technologies, we now propose to compare, in a randomized cross-over trial enrolling 90 participants
with type 1 diabetes, the current CLC (Control-IQ) to three new treatment modalities: ABC and its components
BAM and PAM. To do so, study participants will be randomized to two groups following two different sequences
of treatment modalities: CLCCLC+BAMCLC+PAMABC and ABCCLC+PAMCLC+BAMCLC. Each
treatment modality will continue for 2 months and the treatments will be separated by 2-week washout periods.
This design was used successfully in our previous study and enables four crossover comparisons: CLC vs. ABC
(primary) and CLC+BAM vs. CLC; CLC+PAM vs. ABC; CLC+BAM vs. CLC+PAM (secondary). We expect that:
(1) ABC will be superior to the current CLC in terms of: improved time in the target range 70-180mg/dl measured
 by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM); reduced risk for hypoglycemia, and better technology acceptance;
(2) Behavioral adaptation (CLC+BAM) will be superior to CLC in terms of improved CGM-measured time in the
 target range during the day and reduced CGM-measured incidence of hypoglycemia during/after exercise;
(3) Physiologic adaptation (CLC+PAM) will account for most of the glycemic benefits of ABC overnight, will be
 inferior to BAM in terms of postprandial glucose variability and hypoglycemia during/after exercise, and will
 be superior to BAM in terms of technology acceptance for those who prefer fully-automated control.
Overall, we affirm that reliable technology has been developed and sufficient data accumulated to warrant the
development of next-generation biobehavioral control, aiming adaptation of user behavior to the specifics of CLC
treatment and adaptation of CLC technology to user physiology, separately and in combination. The proposed
project will design and test a system for monitoring and control of these adaptation processes."
10814218,"ABSTRACT
Congenital urinary tract obstruction (UTO) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease in children. There is a
critical need for measures to prevent obstructive nephropathy – the renal injury and dysfunction that result from
UTO. The urothelial lining of the kidney undergoes massive reorganization in response to congenital and
acquired UTO, but until recently the significance of this urothelial remodeling has remained unclear. Recently
published data from our group provide the first experimental evidence that renal urothelial remodeling limits the
extent of obstructive nephropathy. During obstruction, the renal urothelium protects the kidney from injury by
producing an apical plaque composed of Uroplakin proteins. Depletion of the urothelial plaque accelerates
parenchymal loss in a mouse model of congenital UTO, accompanied by renal failure and death. Urothelial
plaque depletion likewise results in increased parenchymal loss following unilateral ureteral obstruction, a model
of acquired UTO. These data in congenital and acquired UTO models provide strong support for our central
hypothesis that the urothelium plays an essential role in protecting the kidney from obstructive nephropathy. The
objectives of this application are three-fold. First, we aim to define the role of urothelial injury as a driver of
obstructive nephropathy. Second, we will test the hypothesis that pharmaceutical enhancers of Uroplakin+ cell
generation and Uroplakin expression can be harnessed therapeutically to limit obstructive nephropathy. Last,
we will test the potential of urothelial proteins as diagnostic biomarkers of obstructive nephropathy in mice and
in children undergoing evaluation for congenital UTO. The long-term objective of this project is to improve the
care of patients with UTO by identifying novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches to prevent
progressive chronic kidney disease."
10814373,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Light regulates neurological function through circuits that remain poorly defined, and there remains a significant
unmet need in understanding photic plasticity in the brain of both sexes. For example, seasonal changes in
day length (i.e., photoperiod) modulate sleep, attention, appetite, metabolism, mood, and immune function
occur in a large number of people, with up to 80% being women. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) drives
circadian and photoperiodic responses to light, but there is a large gap in our understanding of sex differences
in SCN photic and photoperiodic processing. Our preliminary data indicate that circadian and photoperiodic
responses differ by sex, with females display larger behavioral responses to light mediated by divergent SCN
circuits. Based on these data, we propose the central hypothesis that photic processing differs between males
and females because the retina-SCN circuit is sexual dimorphic. We will test that biological sex influences
cellular responses to light (Aim1), photoperiodic responses to day length (Aim2), and neural adaptations in
SCN circuits (Aim3). These studies will benefit from the collective expertise of this collaborative research team,
which specializes in retinal physiology, SCN network properties, cellular imaging, and computational analyses.
Independent of sex differences, successful completion of these studies will provide novel insights into neural
mechanisms of photic processing and photoperiodic encoding to advance understanding in both sexes.
Further, this work is expected to provide information that will be critical to better understanding diseases
incurred by other forms of light-induced disruption (e.g., shiftwork, jetlag)."
10812808,"Summary
Unlike conventional T/B lymphocytes, a group of innate-like T cells, such as γδT cells and invariant NK
T (iNKT) cells, preferentially reside in epithelial tissues such as the skin where they play important roles
in the first line of defense to maintain the tissue integrity and, when dysregulated, also contribute to the
tissue inflammatory diseases. Understanding how skin-specific localization and maintenance of innate-
like T cells are regulated is critical in helping to design strategies targeting these cells for therapeutic
purposes. Our preliminary studies found that iNKT cells generated in the thymus of early postnatal
stages preferentially acquire a skin-homing property for their specific distribution into the skin.
Considering the skin is the outmost barrier tissue exposed to foreign environments immediately after
the birth of a body, we propose that the preferential generation of the skin-homing iNKT cells in the
thymus are important for protection of the “border” in the infant and young and the establishment of the
local immune homeostasis. In this grant application, we will dissect mechanisms regulating thymic
generation of skin-homing iNKT cells and their roles in helping skin tissue development and
homeostasis."
10814824,"The lack of sufficient high-quality, reproducible data across clinical and translational research is creating a
major obstacle for the effective translation of basic research to improve health outcomes. This complex problem
includes inadequate study design, inefficient dissemination of research findings, inadequate patient recruitment,
suboptimal use of electronic health practices, and poor documentation practices. About two thirds of typical
errors are related to problems in the experimental design and performance. Proper study design involves a
comprehensive approach to planning, performance, documentation, analysis, and publication. The research
methods experts at UTMB play a critical role in comprehensive study design and statistical analysis, as well as
interpretation and dissemination of high-quality, ethical clinical and translational research. We have experience
across the entire translational research continuum, with particular expertise in bioinformatics, patient-centered
outcomes research/comparative effectiveness research, large database analysis, clinical trials, data mining,
and network analysis. In this research methods component we will address the major issues in clinical and
translational studies making our CTSA more effective, efficient, and making our studies easily disseminated
to improve health across the country. To accomplish this, we will provide resources to our investigators in the
areas Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design. The Biostatistics Epidemiology and Research Design
group will provide researchers easy access to biostatistical education/training, research design consultation,
and innovative tools and methods to enhance the quality, rigor and efficiency of clinical and translational. The
Office of Clinical Research will provide investigators and study teams with focused regulatory knowledge and
clinical trial management support. We will support investigators with innovative tools such as developing apps
to assess data quality and data mining methods to assess pharmacotherapy-associated toxicities. We will also
apply innovative techniques to enhance trial design and to analyze the results of comparative effectiveness
research. In addition, we will develop a process to obtain electronic consent.Our Research Methods component will enhance innovation, access and quality of clinical and translational
research at UTMB. This is accomplished with tight integration between research methods, hub capacity, and
informatics. Our research methods program encompasses two integrated modules. The Biostatistics, Epidemiology
and Research Design (BERD) team is an essential component of the translational research mission at UTMB,
providing: team-based collaboration and consultation on research design and biostatistics; continuous education,
mentoring and training to students and faculty; and strong support to the informatics core. BERD will continue to
play a critical role in developing innovative research methods at UTMB, with particular emphasis on enhanced
clinical trials, advanced comparative effectiveness research methods, and novel data management tools. The
Office of Clinical Research (OCR) was established in June 2011 as a joint initiative between Research Services
and the CTSA. It is a multidisciplinary service organization, staffed by a team experienced in sponsored clinical
research, that supports faculty with sponsored clinical trials and investigator-initiated clinical research projects.
Guided by the continuous improvement model of our Innovation Score Card, the integrated modules of our
Research Methods component will address the following Specific Aims:"
10814825,"The primary goal of the Hub Research Capacity program is to support innovative research and to provide the
requisite tools for investigators to perform safe, high quality translational research. As outlined in the RFA, this
component of the CTSA will focus on Integrating Special Populations (ISP) along with Participant and Clinical
Interactions (PCI).
Our ISP core has extensive resources for performing translational research in various age groups including but
not limited to children, older adults, pregnant women and neonates (maternal-fetal medicine), as well as
Hispanic populations. Additionally, UTMB has tremendous expertise for investigating rare, orphan diseases
such as porphyria, mast cell disease etc. and research on the current US epidemic, opiate use and addictive
behaviors (Optional HUB). We are exclusively equipped with a state-of-the-art vaccine development center as
a critical arm of preventative care. Our Aim for ISP, will capitalize on existing individual program strengths to
collectively broaden our outreach in multicenter trials and underserved communities. The ISP core will be
intimately linked with Network Capacity and Informatics.
The PCI core will focus its efforts on clinician research education. Specifically, on novel methods to enhance
the safety and efficiency for conducting high quality translational research. Moving forward (Aims), clinical trials
will be augmented by integrating study coaches, training and support for new clinical studies as well as provide
investigators guidance to one of our new satellite studios. Working with Informatics Data Coordinating Center,
the PCI core will provide quality control component for new training, monitoring and regulatory aspects for
multi-site clinical trials. Additionally, UTMB continues to grow into a larger community area. Towards this end,
we will extend UTMB’s Clinical Research Center (CRC) footprint and its human research safety program. To
help accomplish these aims, the PCI core will utilize the Office of Clinical Research, the Clinical Research
Center (CRC) as well as have strong links with Translational Endeavors and Workforce Development."
10814827,"The main functions of the Network Capacity component of the UTMB CTSA Hub are to support networkwide
studies through our Trial Innovation Network (TIN) Hub Liaison Team and to link our hub with the CTSA
Program Central Resources, including the Center for Leading Innovation and Collaboration (CLIC) and the
Clinical Data to Health Coordinating Center (CD2H-CC). We will provide a nurturing environment to conduct
high-quality, efficient, and regulation-compliant multi-site clinical trials in our areas of unique strength. We
will continue to expand and enhance the clinical research and informatics infrastructure to provide more
opportunities for our investigators to participate in TIN multi-site clinical trials and CLIC and CD2H-CC
initiatives. We will also support the local development of multi-site studies to propose for dissemination by
the TIN and will disseminate our Informatics discoveries and our innovative Team Science training programs
nation-wide. We have strengthened and streamlined our clinical research infrastructure. We have integrated
the Hub Liaison Team with the Office of Clinical Research, the single point of contact for all clinical studies.
We have been working with our Informatics core to develop novel tools for clinical trial feasibility, patient
recruitment, clinical data extraction and reporting, and multi-hub software interoperability. We have worked
with Trials Today to establish a searchable customized UTMB trials website. The Hub Liaison Team will
leverage the OCR and the informatics advancements to develop high-quality multi-site clinical trials with high
recruitment yields at UTMB through its interactions with the TIN. The Network Capacity Specific Aims are: Aim
1. Optimize the UTMB Hub Liaison Team to improve access, rapidly respond to, and support CTSA
Network TIN studies. Aim 2. Support and link the CTSA Program Central Resources with the UTMB
Hub. Aim 3. Disseminate Team Science training to the CTSA Network. Effectiveness of the Network
Capacity activities will be measured using common metrics as well as metrics locally developed using our
continuous improvement methodology"
10814830,"Opioid overdose deaths and the rise in problematic opioid use patterns that indicate the development of opioid
use disorder (OUD) have reached crisis levels in the United States. The highest risk for OUD and other substance
use disorders (SUDs) associates with use instigated before 14 years of age. The Poison Center Network
reported 102,940 opioid-related exposures in Texas from 2000-2017, including 21,723 exposures attributed
to adolescents. Deaths attributed to opioids numbered 16,843 from 1999-2015, with 2,200 deaths in the age
range of 15-24 years, tracking with a steady escalation over this period. While Texas ranks among the states
with the lowest rate of opioid overdoses per capita, a 7.4% increase was reported between 2015 and 2016. The
Ecosystem Optimization for Translation (EOT) optional function will harness our rich information technology and
clinical and research excellence to create a Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes)
network. UTMB’s networking in rural and underserved communities is historically strong and this experience is a
central strength of the goal of the EOT to address existing gaps in integrated care in SUDs/OUD. The initial focus
for the teleECHO network builds on the existing relationship with community physicians in 14 family medicine
clinics in rural and underserved Texas counties to promote integration of OUD/SUD and mental health services
into family medicine practices. Telementoring will create a community of practice across healthcare workers
(physicians, faculty, residents, students) to facilitate case-based learning and disseminate best practices in
OUD/SUD care, improve quality of care of patients, and build the relationships required to conduct research in
rural and underserved communities. Partnering with the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium (TRCC), the EOT will
work with the UTMB Regional Maternal and Child Health Program (RMCHP) network of 31 clinics to enhance
teleECHO with targeted, women- and pregnancy-centered topics based upon contemporary knowledge of OUD/
SUDs and mental health disorders. This partnership will capture a quantitative and categorized electronic health
record database for epidemiological surveillance and clinical research in opioids, other risk factors and their
interactions in maternal-perinatal mortality and morbidity. To inform the use of contemporary knowledge, the
teleECHO network will be expanded with adolescent-centered topics, delivered through a community of practice
with teachers and healthcare providers in schools. Working with these schools and communities, we will translate
our evidence-based findings into practice via a Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance
(RE-AIM) approach focused on evidence-based substance use and violence prevention programs. The EOT is
a pivot in emphasis grounded in our collective strengths to move us to a future in which the best practices of
health care for OUD/SUDs, and evidence-based, culturally sensitive education and prevention strategies are
promulgated across diverse urban and rural communities in Texas, and ultimately the national network of CTSAs
and their populations served."
10814832,"The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) has participated as a CTSA hub since 2009. The academic home
of our CTSA, the Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), has brought together multidisciplinary translational
teams (MTTs) and the resources necessary to accelerate discoveries toward better health for individuals and
communities. Building on our existing strengths, CTSA initiatives have transformed UTMB’s learning and research
culture to one that embraces multidisciplinary translational team (MTT) approaches to addressing significant
health problems. We have developed novel educational curricula, significant clinical research programs in
special populations with multisite clinical trials, and provided leadership in the Texas Regional CTSA consortium
(TRCC) and nationally. UTMB’s CTSA hub supports the health goals of the nation by generating, testing and
disseminating integrative team science, education and best practices through stakeholder involvement at all
stages. Managed by a continuous improvement model using an Innovation Scorecard, we will address six
specific aims, to: 1) Expand the knowledge base and practice of collaborative teams to advance the conduct
of translational research through team-based innovation. Building on our team science leadership, we will test,
learn, and disseminate multi-institutional teaming to enhance the quality, efficiency, effectiveness, and diversity
of clinical and translational research. 2) Engage local, regional, and national stakeholders to make research more
effective at meeting their needs. We will build upon our relationships to extend inter-institutional partnerships, and
to work with stakeholders to disseminate scientific findings and advance the field of community engagement. 3)
Harness the potential of harmonized large data platforms across the translational spectrum to improve research
efficiency, develop technologies to support research teams, and share resources with researchers across the
CTSA network. Our aims are designed to enhance our informatics infrastructure and training with regional and
CTSA network interoperability putting existing and novel analytics tools into the hands of users. 4) Promote
clinical and translational research across the lifespan including special populations. We will expand upon our
significant strengths in multi-site trials in special populations to proactively engage the NCATS Trial Innovation
Network for new trials originating from UTMB. 5) Improve training for a diverse workforce in the authentic skills
needed to advance all phases of clinical and translational research. Our integrated U, K, and T programs will
include participants with diverse professional and educational experience, as well as diverse age, gender, racial,
and ethnic characteristics. 6) Develop and disseminate improved methods and processes for translation from
discovery to improved health. We will apply a continuous improvement approach to understand barriers, develop
effective interventions, and disseminate improvements in translational science and operations."
10814895,"PROJECT SUMMARY COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCES
The JAX Computational Sciences (CS) Shared Resource is central to the achievement of the JAX Cancer
Center's (JAXCC) scientific program objectives. As cancer research has become increasingly data intensive, it
is vital that investigators be capable of interpreting and leveraging vast data sets, both publicly available and
internally generated, to understand tumor biology. Such data analysis requires access to a dynamic suite of
analytical tools; infrastructure supporting those tools; computational, bioinformatic and statistical expertise to
mine and analyze the data; and quantitative analysts and software engineers to develop and build queries and
algorithms. Established in 1998, CS has been operating as a shared resource within the JAXCC since 2001 but
was dramatically expanded in 2013. The 41 member CS group addresses faculty needs by providing in-depth
expertise to JAXCC members in support of their independent research projects. This includes guidance in
experimental design; support for the integration of multi-platform data sets, data analysis software applications
and database development; development and application of computational procedures, statistical methods and
scientific software; and project management. CS also provides training and mentorship opportunities in
computational cancer research approaches and manages a plethora of analysis pipelines essential for cancer
genomic research conducted by JAXCC members. Staff include a multi-disciplinary mix of computational
biologists, computer scientists, statisticians, bioinformatics software engineers, and research project managers,
who bring significant depth of expertise in cancer genomics, metabolomics, biostatistics, software development,
machine learning, single cell genomics and integrative analysis, consistent with the needs of JAXCC members.
CS' three operational groups (Statistics and Analysis, Scientific Computing, Research Project Management) are
housed on the Bar Harbor, ME and Farmington, CT campuses, and each supports JAXCC members on both
campuses. Functioning in a modular manner, PIs can access the right mix of experienced expertise tailored to
their scientific needs. The Specific Aims for CS are: 1) To support JAXCC members in developing cutting-edge
analytical procedures for emerging problems in cancer genomics, and to carry out integrative analysis in
fundamental and translational cancer research; 2) To develop bioinformatics applications, maintain scientific
analysis workflows, and provide data architecture and software engineering expertise for the development and
management of scientific data portals pertaining to specific scientific questions addressed by JAXCC members;
and 3) To assist in resource planning for and management of complex computational projects and long-term
information technology and data science development for JAXCC members."
10814897,"PROJECT SUMMARY CANCER MODELS DEVELOPMENT RESOURCE
The Cancer Models Development Resource Shared Resource (CMDR) advises and supports JAX Cancer
Center (JAXCC) members in the design, development, and use of advanced mouse models for cancer research,
including genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), genetically diverse mapping panels, and patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) platforms. The construction and management of mouse models has become a complex
process requiring the expertise of specialized technical experts from different disciplines. While JAX is
institutionally recognized for its technical expertise in mouse model creation and interrogation, a limiting factor
for JAXCC members, particularly those not steeped in murine biology, remains access to expert technological
consultation and project management services. Thus, the primary goals of the CMDR are to support the use of
existing mouse cancer models for all interested JAXCC members and to facilitate the process for those with
limited experience or capacity for modeling cancer in mice in their own labs. The CMDR provides expertise in
GEMMs and PDX mouse modeling, mouse genetics, molecular biology, project management, colony
management, animal care, and regulatory compliance. According to the needs of a specific project, the CMDR
coordinates the activities of other CCSG-supported Shared Resources. The CMDR also serves as a bridge for
JAXCC investigators at the Farmington campus, enabling simplified access to the animal resources and
expertise available at the Bar Harbor campus. As a component of JAX's Genetic Resource Science group (GRS),
the CMDR has ready access to expertise in molecular, neurobiological, reproductive, and developmental biology
in addition to a long history of mouse resource development and skilled animal care and husbandry. To
accomplish our goal of being a one-stop resource for cancer model development and use, we propose two
Specific Aims: 1) Support the development and/or use of genetically engineered mouse models; and 2) Provide
consultation and project management support for the use of patient-derived xenograft mouse models."
10814898,"PROJECT SUMMARY GENOME AND SINGLE CELL TECHNOLOGIES
The key function of The Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center (JAXCC) Genome and Single Cell Technologies
Shared Resource (GSCT) is the provision of genomic technologies to sequence the genomic structures (DNA,
RNA, epigenome) and to precisely define the molecular features of individual cells. GSCT is composed of two
integrated components that are each part of JAX's institutionally managed Scientific Services program: Genome
Technologies, led by Dr. Chia-Lin Wei, and Single Cell Biology, led by Dr. Paul Robson. GSCT provides a
continuum of methods to address complex questions in cancer genomics and genomic biology. Key capabilities
include a suite of molecular biology protocols; diverse platforms for DNA sequencing; and streamlined data
management and analysis systems developed in conjunction with the Computational Sciences Shared
Resource. Sequencing includes first generation Sanger sequencing, second-generation high-throughput short-
read, and third-generation single molecule long-read sequencing services. The expansion of the Shared
Resource to include Single Cell Biology broadens the repertoire of platforms to include droplet-based single cell
transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing. GSCT also continually develops new methods, and identifies and
brings in the best externally developed methods, often in close collaboration with JAXCC members. GSCT keeps
all JAXCC members abreast of the latest available technologies through seminars, workshops, one-on-one
meetings, and directly through hands-on training of JAXCC member trainees. GSCT thus provides
comprehensive, high quality and effective solutions for JAXCC members to profile cancers using whole genome,
epigenome and transcriptome sequencing approaches and spatially resolved cellular phenotyping. In the next
funding cycle, our goal is to continue to provide genomic and single cell technology support and ensure JAXCC
members have access to the platforms they need to investigate the genomic instability and genetic complexity
of cancer and the molecular interactions between a tumor and host that contribute to cancer biology. Our
Specific Aims are to: 1) Incorporate new efficiencies to improve GSCT operations and enhance value to JAXCC
members; 2) Provide JAXCC members with new genomic technologies for multi-dimensional genome analyses;
and 3) Provide the tools to dissect cellular heterogeneity of complex cellular systems."
10814900,"PROJECT SUMMARY GENETIC ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES
The Genetic Engineering Technologies Shared Resource (GET) provides JAX Cancer Center (JAXCC)
members with all-inclusive access to the technical expertise, instrumentation, and centralized facilities necessary
to engineer and produce complex, precisely tunable, genetically engineered mouse models of cancer. Genetic
manipulation of the mouse genome and the production of novel genomic variants has been critical for evaluating
gene function in an organismal context. Unfortunately, many strains have been recalcitrant to genetic
engineering owing to their reproductive biology constraints and inefficiencies with the methods that induce the
gene modification. Thus, to produce next-generation mouse models, these limitations must be overcome by
combining optimal genetic background (i.e., strain) with the ability to engineer single, or multiple, genomic
variants with high efficiency in a cost-effective manner. Through the integration of molecular construct
development, cell biology, microinjection and viral vector expertise, GET is capable of taking a project from
conception to delivery of live mice with transient or germline-transmissible engineered mutations. On behalf of
the JAXCC members, GET performs the associated genetic engineering approaches, including allele design,
gene-editing reagent synthesis and QC, genotyping assay development, and mouse zygote or ES cell gene-
editing manipulation with modern targeted nuclease technology (CRISPR/Cas). The group has extensive
experience (>1000 CRISPR/Cas gene editing projects) and success generating genetically modified mice on
over 100 different inbred and specialty strains, and provides all the necessary husbandry to produce and validate
newly engineered mouse models. The design and production of high-titer viral vector preparations enable
JAXCC members to create somatic transgenesis mouse models that complement germline mutant models. Staff
within all components of GET provide consultation and experimental design support with gene engineering
specialists, as well as support for animal care and use, biosafety and biosecurity applications, training, and
provision of tested reagents and supplies for those investigators who choose to carry out aspects of the genetic
engineering and cell biology processes in their own laboratories. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Provide a
comprehensive, precise genome engineering service capable of generating germline-transmissible alleles not
limited by the mouse strain of origin; 2) Provide comprehensive recombinant virus genome engineering tools for
introducing precise genetic modifications in mammalian cells; and 3) Provide molecular, cellular or embryological
tools for gene engineering or target validation processes for JAXCC members. Execution of these aims in a
centralized resource provides a cost effective, scalable, and precise genome engineering platform as well as the
technical and operational experience no single research laboratory could effectively create and maintain. This is
the value of GET for the JAXCC."
10814903,"PROJECT SUMMARY PHENOTYPING TECHNOLOGIES
The goal of the Phenotyping Technologies Shared Resource (PT) is to provide a spectrum of phenotyping
capabilities and technical support to enable JAX Cancer Center (JAXCC) members to link the genetic and
genomic features of a tumor and/or host tissue with their anatomical, biochemical, protein and cell surface
characteristics. PT comprises four component cores, each managed by domain experts who coordinate research
projects seamlessly across PT's supported technologies as per the needs of the JAXCC member's research
projects. 1) Histopathology Sciences, which includes the Histology, Electron Microscopy, and Clinical
Assessment (hematology and blood chemistry) Services, performs quality-controlled hematology and chemistry
analyses, with detailed physiological and ultrastructural data at both the inter- and intra-cellular level. The 2)
Flow Cytometry and 3) Microscopy Services provide support for high-resolution cellular profiling and imaging,
respectively, in live cells and fresh tissues. 4) The Mass Spectrometry & Protein Chemistry Service is a
comprehensive service with platforms for deep protein and chemical analysis. Technical Leads regularly
evaluate their services and their relevance to JAXCC members, ensuring that JAXCC members receive the most
up-to-date and highest quality services. All four components of PT are based at the Bar Harbor campus, with
additional facilities, equipment and staffing for the Flow Cytometry and Microscopy Services at the Farmington
campus, to facilitate direct access to services for samples that cannot be readily transported between campuses
(such as live cells or fresh tissues). PT provides technical support essential to the success of JAXCC members
and the Cancer Center's overall scientific program objectives. In support of these objectives, PT's Specific Aims
are to: 1) Provide JAXCC members with easy, direct access to services for deep characterization of whole
animals, tissues, cells and proteins; 2) Provide expert phenotyping services that are tailored to JAXCC members'
needs; 3) Provide high quality and efficient services at a reasonable price and turnaround time to our members;
and 4) Provide consultation and project management support for the phenotypic characterization of cancer
models at the cellular, tissue and organismal levels."
10814907,"PROJECT SUMMARY DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS
The scientific leadership has transformed The Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center (JAXCC) in the current grant
cycle, resulting in an expanded cancer focus. New expertise in human genetics and genomics is tightly integrated
with mouse genomics expertise, supporting work to model the complexity of the human cancer genome. Integral
to this transformation was recruitment of new members through faculty hiring and engagement of existing faculty
with complementary transdisciplinary expertise. The JAXCC has expanded its capabilities in cancer genomics
and cancer systems biology, built strength in immuno-oncology and the tumor microenvironment, and
established robust translational partnerships to move basic research quickly towards clinical impact. The
membership has expanded profoundly, driven by a strengthened, cancer-focused leadership on both the Bar
Harbor and Farmington campuses, which saw the addition of 22 new members since 2013 (18 in the current
grant cycle).
Developmental funds have been crucial factors in fueling the JAXCC's growth and productivity. In the current
grant cycle, New Investigator funds were used to support nine junior faculty members, engaging them with the
Senior Leaders who mentored them as they developed their research plans. Awards are made throughout the
year with new investigators submitting a formal program plan for a two-year award. While still early for most, the
progress and productivity of these junior faculty point to the efficacy of this approach. These awards have
supported work leading to 12 publications and 14 external grants totaling $5,064,892. In the next cycle, funds
are requested for support of new investigator awards, which will be leveraged by significant institutional
commitment of funds. Plans call for adding 4 to 5 new junior-level JAXCC members in the next five years, with
a continuing emphasis on cancer genomics and immuno-oncology. Research will rely on the ongoing
development and validation of a variety of in vivo, ex vivo, and in silico systems to model cancer complexity.
The Pilot Project program is an essential part of the plan to achieve the JAXCC's strategic goals. The Senior
Leadership sets priorities and solicits pilot proposals annually through a request for applications (RFA) that
targets specific goals. Projects are awarded based on the quality of the science, their anticipated contribution to
one or more strategic goals, and the plan for securing federal funding for the mature project. In the previous
grant cycle, 17 awards have supported work leading to 14 publications and 14 grants totaling $7,619,270 (direct
costs). Funds are requested to support 2-3 new pilot projects in the first 2 years, open to all JAXCC members
and leveraging institutional match. As the membership matures, we will fund 3-5 pilot funds in years 3 to 5. Taken
together, the Developmental Funds will support the JAXCC in fostering a collaborative and dynamic cancer
program capable of advancing precision cancer medicine."
10814977,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Integrated Health Sciences Facilities Core
The mission of the OSU EHS CC is a) to improve environmental public health and b) to improve the
understanding of the relationships among environmental exposures, human biology, and disease. To drive
translational research that has a transformative impact on health, there is a critical need to unify
environmental health research with stakeholder needs. We need a significant pivot in the ways we work
together to develop and share expertise, tools, resources, and data. While many laboratories and public
organizations have contributed in isolation, their research has not realized transformative health impacts
because they do not adequately co-produce knowledge or leverage collective activities, resources, and
experience. We propose to transform the practice of translational environmental health science by co-
producing actionable knowledge with stakeholders. The Integrated Health Sciences Facilities Core (IHSFC) will
enable stakeholder-engaged translational research projects to achieve two goals: 1) Create science-based
decision support that stakeholders will apply to improve environmental public health. 2) Cultivate long-lasting
relationships that break down barriers between scientists and stakeholders, open rich channels of
communication, create an enduring scientist-stakeholder community, and build the environmental health
literacy of stakeholders by teaching them where they can find state-of-the-art environmental health science
information on demand. The IHSFC will provide training and resources to establish team science-based
collaboration that transforms the way we perform environmental health research across the translational
spectrum. The IHSFC will incorporate researcher and stakeholder experiences, needs, values, and expertise
into the development of cohesive and comprehensive project plans. The IHSFC will plan, execute, oversee, and
evaluate cross-sectoral research that generates actionable information. We will disseminate and communicate
our method of translational environmental research, its outcomes, and its impacts. These are our specific aims:
Aim 1: Catalyze stakeholder-engaged research projects that provides evidence-based support
for stakeholder decisions
Aim 2: Facilitate the execution of stakeholder-engaged, translational research and co-
production of knowledge.
Aim 3: Disseminate research findings and research products to stakeholder partners and to
broader groups of stakeholders.
In this new model of translational environmental health research, the IHSFC will lead and coordinate cross-
sectoral projects in which scientists and stakeholders collaborate to promote translational impact far beyond
the walls of our region and the environmental health science field at large."
10814981,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Community Engagement Core (CEC)
The Community Engagement Core will serve as primary liaison to stakeholders with whom the EHS CC
members will conduct joint research. The EHS CC plans to co-produce knowledge with stakeholders in seven
categories (residential communities, legislators, regulators, manufacturers, health care providers,
pharmaceutical firms, and non-profit organizations). EHS CC members will conduct cross-sectoral
multidisciplinary research with these stakeholders in order to generate actionable scientific evidence to guide a
stakeholder decision that will improve environmental public health. The CEC will work closely with the
Integrated Health Sciences Facilities Core (IHSFC) to move research through the translational spectrum. In
many cases, the CEC will serve as the first point of contact with the stakeholder. The CEC will prepare materials
to educate candidate stakeholders about the capabilities and resources of the EHS CC. The CEC will learn about
the decision the stakeholder wants to make, the context for the decision, and the associated legal, temporal,
financial, political, social, and cultural constraints. The CEC will then communicate this information about
stakeholder issues, needs, and concerns to EHS CC members. We have assembled a Stakeholder Advisory
Board and a group of CEC Affiliates to help us understand unfamiliar stakeholder cultures. When the Executive
Team and the stakeholder(s) agree to proceed, the CEC in collaboration with the IHSFC will develop a Project
Steering Committee (PSC) comprised of stakeholder liaisons and EHS CC investigators. The PSC will help
select a research team capable of co-producing the knowledge required to inform the stakeholder decision. The
PSC will lead and coordinate the project and will oversee research translation and dissemination. The CEC will
work to overcome the boundaries that separate EHS CC scientists from each other and from stakeholders, who
are experts in various non-science disciplines. We will help team members to understand each other's
languages, traditions, perspectives, assumptions, needs, and values. We will assure that communications
remain bidirectional and inclusive. We will apply state-of-the-art dissemination tools and techniques to craft a
final report that stakeholders will apply because they find it credible, salient, and legitimate. To achieve these
goals, the CEC will host Stakeholder Engagement Studios for EHS CC members interested in stakeholder-
engaged research. We will collaborate with the Administration Core to facilitate development of Stakeholder
Engagement Plans for all EHS CC investigators. We will develop an innovative Dissemination Toolkit with
feedback from stakeholders to ensure research outputs are relevant, actionable and understandable. After the
project, the CEC will sustain long-lasting stakeholder relationships that open rich channels of informal
communication and improve environmental health literacy, both the scientific literacy of the stakeholders and
the community literacy of the EHS CC. We will identify and publish guiding principles and best practices for
co-producing actionable knowledge about EHS."

10817662,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), the most common pediatric epilepsy
syndrome, have a mild seizure disorder but have moderate language difficulties, the pathophysiology of which
is currently unknown. Many posit that interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) arising from one or both motor
cortices disrupt language development, possibly by driving atypical connectivity between the motor and language
networks. Supporting this, the candidate found that response of the motor cortex to transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) specifically correlates with performance on a language learning task in BECTS subjects. The
aim of the proposed studies is to use a combination of high-density EEG (HD-EEG) alone and HD-EEG paired
with TMS (TMS-EEG) to determine if IEDs disrupt language function by altering brain connectivity. The central
hypothesis is that IEDs pathologically strengthen connectivity between the motor and language regions, thus
inhibiting development of efficient connectivity within the language network. Aim 1 will define the immediate
impact of IEDs on connectivity between the motor and language regions. Aim 2 will determine if children with
BECTS have decreased connectivity within the language network compared to controls and whether disrupted
connectivity predicts language dysfunction. We do not typically treat IEDs in BECTS as medications have limited
efficacy and global neurologic impact. In contrast, repetitive trains of TMS (rTMS) have therapeutic potential for
the treatment of IEDs as rTMS induces focal changes in cortical excitability. Thus, Aim 3 will determine if rTMS
to the motor cortex reduces IED frequency and normalizes connectivity in children with BECTS.
Dr. Baumer is a pediatric epileptologist at Stanford University who is establishing herself as an investigator in
patient-oriented research. Her goal is to advance our mechanistic understanding of cognitive comorbidities in
pediatric epilepsy. Dr. Baumer’s clinical training coupled with her background in TMS and clinical research make
her ideally suited to contribute in this area. The training plan outlined in this application will allow Dr. Baumer to
develop expertise in: (1) the conceptual and practical analysis of HD-EEG and TMS-EEG data with emphasis
on connectivity analysis; (2) the design and implementation of pediatric TMS-EEG studies; and (3) the
neurodevelopment and assessment of language processing. To achieve these goals, she has assembled a
mentorship team of internationally recognized physician-scientists with expertise in the measurement and
modulation of brain connectivity as well as the neuroscience of language development. She has recruited
advisors with methodologic expertise in pediatric TMS, HD-EEG, and epilepsy research. Along with her mentors,
Dr. Baumer has chosen laboratory rotations and courses that complement her research to ensure that she
reaches her training goals. Upon conclusion of the award, Dr. Baumer will be optimally positioned to lead a
pediatric neurostimulation research program that focuses on the interactions of epilepsy and cognition."
10817664,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A functional immune system is central to human health and, at the same time, alterations of normal lymphoid
developmental programs can lead to immune deficiencies, autoimmune diseases and a variety of lymphomas.
Germinal centers (GCs) are microanatomical structures formed in secondary lymphoid organs during antigen-
stimulated immune responses. GCs are the sites of B cell maturation through clonal expansion, somatic
hypermutation, and affinity-mediated selection -- and therefore play a critical role in differentiation of antibody
secreting cells and memory B cells. OCA-B is a unique transcriptional coactivator that is highly expressed in GC
B cells and GC-derived lymphomas such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt’s lymphoma. In vivo
studies have demonstrated that OCA-B is essential for both antigen-dependent B cell differentiation (including
GC formation) and normal expression of secondary immunoglobulin genes. However, little is known about the
exact role of OCA-B in normal GC formation and GC-derived lymphoma progression. In addition, the mechanism
by which OCA-B regulates its target genes is also unclear. In addressing these issues, our preliminary studies
have demonstrated (i) a functional occupancy of OCA-B on distal enhancers, in particular the large locus control
region (LCR) of the BCL6 gene that encodes a master regulator of GC formation; (ii) direct interactions of OCA-
B with the MED1 subunit of the Mediator coactivator complex and with a GC-specific transcription factor (MEF2B)
important for BCL6 expression and (iii) a B cell-intrinsic Oca-B dependency for GC B cell differentiation in vivo.
 Based on our previous OCA-B studies and recent preliminary data, we hypothesize that a predominant role
of OCA-B in GC formation involves activation of BCL6 through its distal enhancer region by recruiting and
concentrating transcription factors and cofactors, including chromatin/epigenetic factors, that facilitate enhancer-
promoter interactions. We also hypothesis that OCA-B plays a critical role in GC-derived lymphomagenesis. To
address these issues, we will investigate (i) the function and mechanism of action of OCA-B, through interactions
with MED1/Mediator and MEF2B, on the BCL6 LCR/super-enhancer in both ex vivo GC B and lymphoma cells,
(ii) the mechanism of action of OCA-B-dependent transcriptional coactivation through rigorous biochemical in
vitro transcription assays; (iii) the mechanism of action of OCA-B in GC B cell differentiation in vivo, including
identification of key target genes and regulatory networks; (iv) the role of OCA-B in B cell lymphoma progression
in vivo. We will use complementary biochemical, genomic, bioinformatic, genetic, gene-editing, cell-based and
in vivo (mouse model) approaches. Completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the molecular
mechanism of action of OCA-B in GC-specific transcriptional regulation, GC B cell differentiation, and GC-
derived B cell lymphomagenesis. Notably, it also will provide clues to new therapeutic strategies for treating B
cell lymphomas."
10808857,"Background: This proposal is intended to support the career development of Sanket Dhruva, MD, MHS, a
Staff Cardiologist at the San Francisco VA and Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of California,
San Francisco into an independent VA health services researcher with the training and experience necessary
to conduct innovative research and develop interventions that improve safety of Veterans with cardiovascular
implantable electronic devices (CIEDs: pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators [ICDs]). Even
though more than 10% of the 55,000 Veterans followed by VA have suffered CIED-related complications, there
has not been any systematic evaluation to identify failed CIED leads using VA’s data systems.
Significance/Impact: This research will close Dr. Dhruva’s knowledge gaps in biostatistics, data science, and
qualitative methods, enabling him to generate actionable, high-quality evidence to inform VA cardiac
electrophysiologists to implant the safest devices in Veterans. This research will also enable him to identify
CIED leads that have already been implanted in Veterans but are at risk for failure, thereby informing
strategies to avoid clinical sequelae of failure (such as inappropriate shocks and death) for individual Veterans.
This proposal is directly aligned with operational priorities set forth in VHA Directive 1189 (published in January
2020) to “monitor the safety of CIEDs,” HSR&D Priorities of a Learning Healthcare System and improving
Veteran Quality of Care and Safety, and supports VHA’s priority of becoming a High-Reliability Organization.
Innovation: This research is innovative through its application of advanced statistical methods to leverage a
comprehensive, longitudinal database of Veterans with CIEDs, the VA National Cardiac Device Surveillance
Program (NCDSP), including temporally dense CIED-generated data, to address the large-scale, complex
problem of identifying CIED lead failure. Additionally, this research provides information about the unexplored
question of physician selection of manufacturer and model of device to implant and the role of safety data.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: To compare risk-adjusted failure rates of different cardiovascular implantable
electronic device (CIED) lead models among Veterans.
H1: We will detect one or more CIED lead models with statistically and clinically significantly higher failure
rates when compared to other leads of the same type (e.g. ICD lead when compared to all other ICD leads).
Aim 2: To develop risk prediction models of all-cause CIED lead failure among Veterans by applying
supervised machine learning methods to repeated measures from CIED remote monitoring data.
H2: Risk prediction models will detect lead failure with high discrimination (area under the curve [AUC] ≥0.85)
and adequate calibration at 3 months and 12 months post-assessment.
Aim 3: To conduct a pilot study to determine the effect of an academic detailing and audit and
feedback intervention on the specific CIED lead models implanted in Veterans.
H3: Post-intervention, Veterans will more often be implanted with lead models associated with the lowest
failure rates.
Methodology: Aim 1 will use sequential propensity score-adjusted simulated prospective survival analyses
applied to a dataset of the NCDSP linked to VA’s Corporate Data Warehouse and Medicare data. Aim 2 will
apply two supervised machine learning techniques, elastic net and random forests, to quarterly patient-
generated data from CIEDs to create prediction models. Aim 3 will include qualitative interviews of cardiac
electrophysiologists about device selection and the development, implementation, and evaluation of an
academic detailing and audit and feedback intervention for cardiac electrophysiologists in 3 VISNs.
Implementation: This research will enable Dr. Dhruva to become an independent VA HSR&D investigator who
conducts research to improve outcomes for Veterans with CIEDs and those who will receive one in the future."
10808860,"Project Summary
 Although it is widely known that people with psychosis (PSY) exhibit impairment in a number of cognitive
domains—and working memory (WM) in particular—interventions aimed at remediating these deficits have
been only modestly successful, and mixed results continue to emerge. One critical barrier to increasing the
effectiveness of these interventions is the lack of clarity regarding neurobiological mechanisms that give rise to
these impairments, and that can be used as treatment targets for intervention development. We suggest that
one reason for this lack of clarity is that WM is frequently studied as a unitary phenomenon, when in fact it is
dependent upon several cognitive sub-processes—each of which is supported by a unique neural process, and
any one or any set of which may be impaired in PSY.
 In the present proposal, we will evaluate the role that a promising oscillatory candidate biomarker (alpha
desynchronization) plays in constraining WM capacity in PSY. Then, using neurofeedback, we will train
participants to modulate this signal and evaluate the impact of this training on visual WM retention. Recently,
we and others have demonstrated that robust task-related alpha desynchronization is associated with higher
memory capacity among healthy control subjects during a WM task. Furthermore, PSY exhibit robust
impairments in this oscillatory process, indicating that it is a strong candidate mechanism by which WM
capacity is constrained in this population. However, because a typical WM task is unable to distinguish
between the various cognitive sub-processes that support WM, it is not yet known which of these sub-
processes is linked to impaired alpha desynchronization in PSY.
 In the proposed study, we aim to identify the disrupted sub-process that is reflected in impaired alpha
desynchronization in PSY (Aim 1), and further evaluate the causal relationship between this brain process and
WM storage by manipulating alpha synchronization using neurofeedback (Aim 3). Additionally, we will
determine the extent to which impaired alpha desynchronization is specific to psychotic illness, and the degree
to which it is impacted by illness chronicity (Aim 2). Finally, in an Exploratory Aim 4, we will also measure a
secondary oscillatory biomarker, theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling, which has previously been linked to
the maintenance of a memory trace during the delay interval of a WM task.
 Our overall goal is to clarify the mechanistic role that alpha desynchronization plays in constraining WM
capacity in PSY and its impact on downstream neural processes (i.e., theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling),
which will lay the groundwork for future development of precision interventions that may effectively target these
processes to yield improvements in WM among PSY."

Title: Early change in circulating tumor DNA as a patient- and trial-level diagnostic in advanced lung cancer
Primary Investigator: Geoffrey R. Oxnard, MD
 Genomic analysis of plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is transforming the care of advanced non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Plasma ctDNA genotyping approaches (also known as “liquid biopsies”) are
now used routinely to noninvasively test for key cancer genotypes (EGFR, KRAS, ALK, ROS1, etc), both to
guide initial systemic treatment or to effectively target drug resistance. The quantitative nature of this
diagnostic creates obvious potential for use as a noninvasive tool for monitoring treatment response, a
phenomenon we and others have shown retrospectively but an approach which is inadequately being
leveraged clinically. Our preliminary data suggests that plasma ctDNA response is a highly dynamic marker,
offering rapid insight into treatment effect, earlier and potentially more sensitively than standard response
imaging. In an era with an increasing number and variety of cancer therapies, nimble tools for evaluating
treatment benefit may help us better assess therapies and get patients onto the best treatments.
 Our group at DFCI is uniquely positioned to translate plasma genomics into a clinical response
biomarker for NSCLC care. We have led the clinical validation of numerous ctDNA genotyping assays, while
simultaneously characterizing the complexities and limitations of ctDNA genomics. In parallel, we have a
strong track record in studying radiographic response as a translational tool and trial endpoint. Our group is
unique in its focus on the clinical application of novel diagnostics, with a deep understanding of the clinical
decision points and the necessary diagnostic performance. Building off this experience, we have an
opportunity now to address a critical scientific gap and inform the scientific community on (1) what constitutes a
plasma response, (2) what does a plasma response signify, and (3) how should plasma response be used as a
patient-level and trial-level diagnostic.
 In this application, we first plan to quantify the clinical variation of ctDNA levels in patients with NSCLC
starting a new therapy and, using existing trial and clinical cohorts, identify and validate a plasma response
cutpoint which reliably and robustly predicts for benefit from therapy. In parallel, we will perform a trial-level
analysis of plasma response in a cohort of 11 expansion cohorts from 8 clinical trials in EGFR- and KRAS-
mutant NSCLC, all with plasma being banked at DFCI, to understand the optimal timing of plasma response as
well as its ability to predict trial outcome (radiographic response rate). Finally, we will launch a therapeutic trial
of first-line immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC which uses plasma response assessment to adaptively guide
intensification of treatment, a paradigm-shifting approach which, if successful, has the potential to motivate a
new generation of trials using plasma ctDNA monitoring to effectively evolve the treatment of cancer patients.
Together, these studies will lay the groundwork for ctDNA-based response assessment as a widely available
tool for guiding patient care and for clinical trial analysis."

Placentally-mediated adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO), including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,
preterm birth, and fetal growth restriction, may play an underrecognized role in the development of Alzheimer's
disease and related dementias (ADRD). These APO may contribute to maternal ADRD risk through biological
processes such as vascular endothelial dysfunction and angiogenic dysregulation. However, these pathways
remain poorly characterized due to lack of well-phenotyped prospective pregnancy data with longitudinal follow
up of mothers. This study will capitalize on a multi-ethnic prospective cohort study, the Nulliparous Pregnancy
Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be Heart Health Study (nuMoM2b-HHS) to understand how APO may
influence maternal ADRD risk. From 2010-2013, the nuMoM2b study enrolled a diverse cohort of 10,038
healthy nulliparous individuals at 8 US academic medical centers who were followed from the first trimester
through the delivery of their first child. Pregnancies were phenotyped in detail, and APO occurred in >20% of
participants. The follow-up nuMoM2b-HHS followed nuMoM2b participants to characterize subsequent
pregnancy outcomes and accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors. This unique cohort, now 10-15 years
from their index pregnancy, currently consists of approximately 6500 individuals. The latest wave of in-person
visits began in 2022 and will continue through 2027. This wave already includes neurocognitive assessments
in all nuMoM2b-HHS participants, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of 250 participants
at Columbia University. We propose a new nuMoM2b-HHS ancillary study to investigate pathways by which
APO may lead to ADRD, using a combination of imaging and blood biomarkers. We will collect MRI data from
participants at three additional study sites (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Northwestern University,
and Indiana University), augmenting the racial, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity of the MRI sub-cohort.
Neuroimaging outcomes of interest will include gray matter volume, white matter hyperintensity volume, global
and regional cortical thickness, global and regional cerebral blood flow, and diffusion tensor imaging-based
fractional anisotropy. We will 1) determine whether those with and without history of APO differ in MRI ADRD
risk markers and 2) correlate placental growth factor (PlGF) levels measured during and after the index
pregnancy with the same MRI markers, in participants with and without a history of APO. PlGF, an angiogenic
regulatory protein, was selected as an exposure of interest due to its well-established status as a marker of
placental dysfunction during pregnancy, and recently recognized reliability as a later life biomarker for vascular
cognitive impairment and dementia. We hypothesize that lower 2nd-trimester PlGF levels and higher post-
pregnancy PlGF levels will correlate with early markers of neurodegeneration, global and regional changes in
cerebral blood flow, and white matter microstructural damage. This will be the first prospective study to
investigate the relationship between APO, angiogenic dysfunction, and future maternal ADRD risk."

This is an application for a Mentored Clinician Scientist Research Career Development Award.
The goal of the proposed project is to provide the candidate with advanced skills needed to
transition to an independent translational investigator with focus on accurate prognostic
biomarkers and development of a tailored treatment algorithm in HCC. To facilitate this long-term
career goal the candidate will examine multiple imaging, clinical and blood-based biomarkers,
and investigate the role of liquid biopsy in HCC progression in liver transplant-eligible patients.
The candidate proposes a comprehensive training plan, combining didactic instruction overseen
by her mentors, formal coursework, participation in applied training experiences with individual
mentors/advisors, and supervised performance of relevant laboratory techniques. The proposed
study will enroll HCC patients listed for liver transplantation and follow until the time of
transplantation or disease progression and death. She will identify the determinants contributing
to the disparate outcomes by including novel functional imaging, clinical risk factors and
circulating biomarkers including circulating tumor cells, immune cells and tumor DNA. This
application provides a more tailored approach to patient management in the limited time available,
to offer effective therapy to patients who are challenged with a lethal cancer and end-stage liver
disease. It would also improve liver transplant organ allocation, thus improving overall therapeutic
value for liver transplant recipients."

Continued expression of androgen receptor (AR) and its variants, such as AR-V7, despite AR targeted therapy
contributes to treatment resistance and cancer progression in advanced CRPC patients. This highlights the
need for new strategies to block continued AR signaling. Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3)
is one of the most important genes involved in androgen synthesis and metabolism. Activity of this enzyme
cannot be inhibited by abiraterone. Both AR/AR-V7 and AKR1C3 play key roles in cancer progression and
driving resistance to current therapies. Therefore, inhibition of both AR/AR-V7 and AKR1C3 would be an ideal
strategy for treating advanced prostate cancer (PCa). We have designed a novel strategy to simultaneously
target the AR/AR-V7 and AKR1C3 pathways. We designed and synthesized a library of novel dual
AKR1C3/AR/AR-variant inhibitors, called LX, according to structure-based computer modeling. Of the LX
compounds, LX-1 had the greatest effect at reducing cell number, AR/AR variant expression, and AKR1C3
activity. RNA-seq analysis demonstrated a robust reduction in expression of AR and AR-V7 signaling genes
by the selected LX. LX-1 inhibited conversion of the testosterone precursor androstenedione into testosterone
in tumor cells which express high levels of AKR1C3 in a dose-dependent manner ex vivo. Furthermore,
treatment with LX-1 reduced tumor growth in VCaP and LuCaP35CR PDX xenografts in vivo and decreased
intratumoral testosterone. Based on these findings, the overall hypothesis is that concurrent inhibition of
AR/AR variants and AKR1C3 using novel LX dual inhibitor suppresses CRPC tumor growth, overcomes
resistance and improves treatment response to enzalutamide/abiraterone. This project is to further
characterize LX by understanding its mechanism of action (MOA), determining its efficacy, pharmacokinetics
and toxicity, and to determine their effects on the sensitivity to anti-androgen therapy with the goal to translate
to future clinical development to treat advanced PCa. We hope that completion of the proposed studies will
lead to the development of a new class of therapeutic agents that target both intracrine androgen synthesis
and the AR signaling."

10795843,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We recently discovered that low, rather than high, expression of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) in
the serine biosynthesis pathway is indicative of metastasis in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) primary
tumors. Our preliminary experiments indicate that low PHGDH expression results in upregulation of the sialic
acid biosynthesis pathway, which in turn activates cellular programs required for metastasis. However, catalytic
inhibition of PHGDH does not increase sialic acid biosynthesis or metastasis, suggesting a non-catalytic role for
PHGDH. This project aims to: 1) investigate this non-canonical role of PHGDH in modulating sialic acid
biosynthesis, 2) decipher the metabolic rewiring that dictates low-PHGDH activation of sialic acid metabolism,
and 3) elucidate the mechanism of low PHGDH, high sialic acid metabolism-driven metastasis. To confirm non-
canonical PHGDH function, we will knock out other serine biosynthetic genes to show that it is not inhibition of
serine biosynthesis that drives sialic acid upregulation and metastasis. We will investigate PHGDH protein-
protein interactions and subcellular localization of PHGDH protein to further probe its non-canonical function.
Metabolic rewiring in low-PHGDH cells will be elucidated in detail using mass spectrometry methods. We will
also overexpress genes in metabolic pathways branching from glycolysis to determine whether sialic acid
metabolic flux is sensitive to diversion of carbon flux into competing pathways. Finally, our preliminary data links
high sialic acid metabolic flux to increased phosphorylation of EMT markers and p38 and c-SRC as drivers of
metastasis. We will study the importance of p38 and SRC phosphorylation in potentiating metastasis and
investigate whether this link is mediated by increased sialic acid flux or sialylation at the cell surface. Our overall
objective is to elucidate the mechanism of low PHGDH driven sialic acid upregulation as an enabler of breast
cancer metastasis, which will lead to new biomarkers (low PHGDH, high sialic acid) for metastasis and
development of novel therapeutic strategies for metastatic TNBC."
10795914,"Project Summary/ Abstract:
Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and type 2 (PAI-2) are serine protease inhibitors of tissue
plasminogen activator and urokinase. PAI-2, which is encoded by SerpinB2, has been shown to be critical to
the pathogenesis of different diseases including cancer and nematode infection. However, its role in obesity-
associated insulin resistance is not known. Our preliminary experiments revealed that diabetic patients
harbored significantly reduced number of SerpinB2+ cells in omental adipose tissue compared to non-diabetic
individuals. Moreover, we observed an inverse correlation between the frequency of SerpinB2+ cells and body
mass index in patients, suggesting a protective role of SerpinB2 in diabetes. Consistently, SerpinB2-deficient
mice exhibited impaired glucose tolerance. Among all hematopoietic cells in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), only
resident macrophages expressed detectable and high amount of SerpinB2. This macrophage subset had
significantly reduced SerpinB2 expression in obese humans and mice compared to lean control. Furthermore,
VAT of obese humans and mice contained diminished number of resident macrophages due to their high
apoptosis, which is in line with the well-known anti-apoptotic role of SerpinB2. Additionally, we found that
SerpinB2 is essential for the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, by VAT resident
macrophages. These cytokines are crucial for maintaining insulin sensitivity. Based on these observations, we
hypothesize that reduced SerpinB2 expression in obesity triggers VAT resident macrophage apoptosis,
increases inflammation and promotes insulin resistance. We will test this hypothesis in two specific aims. Aim.
1. To determine the role of SerpinB2 in insulin resistance, we will use 3-fold approaches: a) SerpinB2-/- mice, b)
macrophage-specific SerpinB2-deficient mice (LysMcre/+ SerpinB2fl/fl) and c) SerpinB2 silencing in VAT
macrophages in vivo in wild type mice using siRNA formulated in lipidoid nanoparticles. Furthermore, we will
determine if T cell-derived IFN-γ in obesity decreases SerpinB2 expression. We will also test if SerpinB2-
mediated production of anti-inflammatory cytokines depends on Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and mitogen
activated protein kinase (MAPK) activators ERK1/2. Aim. 2. We will investigate the molecular mechanisms of
the prevention of apoptosis by SerpinB2. Our preliminary data demonstrated that SerpinB2-deficient
macrophages contained diminished levels of transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a known modulator of caspase.
Additionally, we observed that SerpinB2 directly binds to TG2. To determine if anti-apoptotic effect of SerpinB2
is TG2-mediated, we will overexpress SerpinB2 in TG2-deficient macrophages and use specific TG2 inhibitors."
10795946,"Project Summary:
Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million adults in the U.S. and is a leading cause
of disability. There is growing recognition of distinct phenotypes within OA and the need to tailor
therapies to specific phenotypes. Intra-articular inflammation manifesting as synovitis has
emerged as an important phenotypic feature associated with pain and structural progression.
This proposal centers on understanding the role of synovitis and its topographic and temporal
effects on pain as well as its potential as a treatment target. The first aim investigates whether
discordance in effusion-synovitis between an individual’s knees portends differential pain
reporting between the knees. Longitudinally we will investigate whether changes in synovitis
over 24 months are associated with changes in pain. These analyses will include adjustment for
both knee and individual level contributors to pain to better ascertain the independent effect of
synovitis on pain. The second aim uses ultrasound, a readily available and inexpensive imaging
technique, to examine whether the presence of effusion-synovitis in the knee identifies a
subgroup that will have a greater reduction in pain after intra-articular steroid injection. Lastly,
aim 3 will utilize single-cell RNA sequencing of the synovium in patients with mild, moderate and
severe OA to better define cell types and transcriptional profiles active at various OA stages. If,
as we suspect, inflammation is more predominant early in the disease process, anti-
inflammatory therapies may be most effective in early OA.
This funding opportunity and project are specifically geared toward my transitioning to an
independent investigator and R01 funding. I will have protected time for this project and a
uniquely supportive and rich academic environment with access to world-leading mentors,
coursework, and career development series through the Harvard Medical School, Harvard T.H.
Chan School of Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Specifically, the aims in this
proposal will provide experience with advanced hierarchical, clustered and longitudinal
statistical modeling, use of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging variables in analysis,
and RNA sequencing of the synovium. These aims and educational opportunities will give me
an in-depth understanding of methods to investigate key facets of inflammation in OA,
positioning me to lead future work on the timing and targeting of novel OA therapies."
10795947,"This R35 proposal represents a comprehensive, long-term program that explores new mechanisms and
therapeutic concepts related to the formation of the unique types of atherosclerotic plaques that cause acute
cardiovascular disease (CVD). The training and mentoring of young scientists is also a key part of this program.
The PI has held multiple NIH grants without interruption for many years, publishes on atherosclerosis and
cardiometabolic disease in the highest impact journals, and has a highly successful record of training young
scientists to be independent academic researchers. The program will explore new, highly interrelated concepts
related to four key areas in which major gaps exist: (i) inflammation resolution and efferocytosis (clearance of
dead cells); (ii) pathophysiology of the minority of atherosclerotic lesions that are most clinically important; (iii)
amino acid metabolism in M""phi""s as it relates to high-burden efferocytosis; and (iv) aging-related clonal
hematopoiesis (CH). Processes that impair inflammation resolution, which are distinct from those that promote
inflammation per se, and defective efferocytosis promote the formation of clinically relevant necrotic, thin-capped
plaques. The lab's new work indicates that (i) the ability of M""phi""s to internalize multiple apoptotic cells (high-burden
efferocytosis) is critical to avoid necrotic plaques (Cell 2017); and (ii) a pathway related to M""phi"" metabolism of
apoptotic cell-derived amino acids is critical for high-burden efferocytosis. Another exciting new concept
supported by preliminary data is that impaired efferocytosis and resolution are exacerbated by CH, which is
emerging as a major age-related risk factor for atherosclerotic CVD. The overall vision of the program is to study
these new areas by first using (i) mouse and human M""phi""s to elucidate in-depth mechanisms; and (ii) genetically
altered mice to test causation in advanced plaque progression. The R35 will also explore the therapeutic potential
of these ideas in pre-clinical models, with the hypothesis that resolution mediator therapy will have efficacy and
safety advantages over conventional anti-inflammatory therapy. The PI will then use the flexibility and continuity
of the R35 program to move into new directions related to human studies. Through a rich network of collaborators
at Columbia and elsewhere—including Columbia's Cardiovascular and Metabolic Precision Medicine program—
the program will apply the new discoveries to (i) analyses of human atheroma; (ii) human genetics, including
subjects with KOs of genes in resolution/efferocytosis pathways through a collaboration with the PROMIS study;
and (iii) studies with human monocyte- and iPSC-derived M""phi""s that are amenable to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
genetic engineering, as guided by the program's mechanistic and human genetic data. Through the flexibility
and forward-looking nature of the R35 program, the combination of the proposed mechanistic work and human
studies will provide a power combination to fill in critical gaps in how dangerous plaque form; to devise novel
therapeutic strategies; and to train and mentor young scientists in this critical area of research."
10795948,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and other genetic analyses consistently implicate non-coding cis-
regulatory elements (CREs) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, the contribution of CREs to
the risk of developing AMD remains poorly understood because the function these elements has not yet been
directly tested. The barrier for testing AMD-associated CREs is in part due to the challenge of developing
experimentally validated model systems. CREs can be cell-type-specific and are not necessarily conserved
between humans and model organisms. It therefore remains unclear which CREs may be studied in vivo in
transgenic mice versus which require an in vitro human cell system. This gap in knowledge is a significant
obstacle toward understanding the genetic regulation of normal human vision and to understanding the
contribution of specific CREs to AMD. The long-term goal for our research is to understand how genetic variation
within CREs shapes the structure and function of the retina and contributes to the risk of developing AMD and
other disorders of vision. The focused objective of this proposal is to optimize and validate model systems for
studying the function of AMD-associated CREs. The central hypothesis driving this work is that some AMD-
associated CREs will be conserved between humans and mice due to their functional importance in vision. Other
CREs may be human-specific due to their essential roles in the macula, a part of the retina that is not present in
mice. In each of these cases, one or more optimal systems will be required to understand the function of each
AMD-associated CRE. To test this hypothesis, we are pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Determine the
functional conservation of AMD-associated CREs between humans and mice. 2) Test the function of a specific
CRE that is known to be conserved between humans and mice from our preliminary studies in a newly developed
mouse knockout model. 3) Test the requirement of human-specific CREs that are among the leading contributors
to AMD risk, in induced human retinal tissue cultures. Together these experiments will enable discovery of
genetic contributions to human vision and inherited visual diseases that have thus far been inaccessible using
current methods."

10796881,"Microbiome Core, Summary
Mounting evidence indicates a strong association between the microbiome and immune development in early
life (IDEAL). More specifically, we and others are providing growing evidence for a role of the microbiome in
the three clinical outcomes targeted in this IDEAL proposal: vaccine response, respiratory infection, and
asthma. In support of the proposed IDEAL program, the Microbiome Core (MBC) will generate and analyze
shotgun metagenomes from 1300 nasal and fecal samples from the existing Rochester Combined Cohort
(RCC) and the prospective Rochester IDEAL Cohort (RIC). Data generation and analyses will be conducted
with rigorous quality assurance measures. The microbiome data, paired with clinical and other omic data,
will be exceptional for an IDEAL study, and the nasal metagenomes will be unprecedented in scope and depth
of microbiome coverage. The premise at the foundation of the MBC is that the microbiome is a key driver of
IDEAL. As a consequence, we hypothesize that the microbiome will contribute to key objectives of the overall
IDEAL proposal, (i) early prediction of clinical phenotypes, (ii) delineation of molecular endotypes among the
phenotypes, and (iii) identification of actionable therapeutic targets. Further, comparative analysis of
microbiomes will provide mechanistic insight to interactions between the microbiome and IDEAL. The MBC has
two Specific Aims: SA1 is to generate microbiome data products, (i) high-quality shotgun metagenome
sequence data, (ii) taxonomic profiles, and (iii) functional profiles. The data products will be transferred to the
Data Management Core (DMC) to support Projects (PR) 1-3 in addressing the above key objectives. SA2 is
microbiome analysis using both taxonomic and functional profiles, focussing on diversity, differential

and mechanistic interpretation of microbiome variability among the clinical phenotypes and molecular
endotypes."
10796883,"Project Summary: IDEAL Proteomics and Metabolomics Core (PMC)
The central premise of the overall proposal Immune Development in Early Life (IDEAL) Shapes Vaccine
Response, Respiratory Infectious Disease and Asthma is that childhood immune development generates
immunological endotypes with distinct biological mechanisms leading to co-morbidity among the three clinical
phenotypes of interest vaccine responsiveness, respiratory infection proneness, and asthma.
Our overall hypothesis is that unfavorable immune trajectories in early life result in clinical phenotypes such as
low vaccine responsiveness, frequent respiratory infections and development of asthma, with significant overlap.
These three clinical phenotypes are the converging clinical manifestations of various immune endotypes, i.e.,
distinct cellular and molecular signatures associated with the underlying mechanistic processes. The objective
of the proposal is to test this hypothesis and to provide multidimensional quantitative molecular maps enabling
description of the underlying immunological endotypes, with the ultimate goal to identify biomarkers to identify
children at risk for unfavorable immune trajectories and to identify actionable targets for intervention.
Given the importance of cytokines/chemokines, proteins and metabolites in modulating immune development,
mapping their differential abundances in the context of the three different clinical phenotypes will be essential to
understand the underlying immunological endotypes, which will be identified in Project 1 (PR1), further examined
in vitro in PR3, and ultimately integrated with epigenetic data from PR2. To enable the proposed research, the
Proteomics and Metabolomics Core (PMC) will manage, handle, and aliquot ~1900 plasma and ~600
nasopharyngeal wash samples (provided/collected by the IDEAL Clinical Core; CC) and provide the Data
Management Core (DMC) the quantitative cytokine/chemokine, proteome, and metabolome maps.
Specific Aim 1 will use a well-established multiplex platform (Luminex; 41-plex Milliplex system) to detect and
quantify 41 cytokines and chemokines in plasma and nasopharyngeal wash samples.
Specific Aim 2 describes a 2-pronged LC/MS-based plasma proteomics approach yielding ~700 proteins
detected per sample, which covers the classical plasma proteome as well as a major fraction of the tissue
leakage proteins in plasma. Furthermore, the nasopharyngeal wash proteomes will be mapped using LC/MS-
based methods. All LC/MS analyses will be carried out in a high throughput fashion (60 to 100 samples/day)
including 96-well plate-based processing.
Specific Aim 3 coordinate the aliquoting and shipment of samples to Metabolon, Inc which, as leader in the field
of metabolomics services, will perform the LC/MS-based metabolomic analysis of the plasma yielding >1,000
metabolites detected per sample as well as nasopharyngeal wash samples.

10796845,"Integrative Polygenic Genetic Studies of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
Summary
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is caused by hepatic steatosis (lipid accumulation),
affects up to 29 million adults in the U.S. and has become the leading cause of liver disease.
NAFLD can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are few effective ways to
prevent or treat NAFLD. A better understanding of NAFLD etiology is needed to improve its
diagnosis and treatment. NAFLD is heritable (genetically influenced) and identified common
variants that explain ~20% of heritability of this trait, suggesting that more causal variants that
affect this trait remain to be discovered. While histology has historically been used to define
NAFLD steatosis, NAFLD is now routinely diagnosed using non invasive imaging or elevated
ALT/AST without the presence of other liver diseases. We recently published the world’s largest
cross ancestry GWAS analysis of serum ALT/AST/ALP GWAS where we identified >300
genome wide significant variants that associate with these traits; 23 of them also associated
with increased hepatic steatosis assessed in 7600 individuals using liver imaging. We showed
that a polygenic risk score (PRS) from the ALT but not AST or ALP genome wide significant
variants was able to predict steatosis, cirrhosis, and HCC. Here, we have assembled the largest
collection of multiethnic samples with hepatic steatosis measured with liver imaging or NAFLD
diagnosed by international classification of disease code with genome wide data also available.
We hypothesize that (1) common and low frequency variants contribute to NAFLD variation and
risk (2) identified variants in aggregate will improve risk prediction for liver steatosis, cirrhosis
and HCC compared to single variants and (3) GWAS NAFLD prioritized genes, when targeted,
will function autonomously in hepatocytes to cause steatosis. The objective of this application is
to carry out a GWAS meta analysis of NAFLD across imaging or ICD diagnosed NAFLD. A PRS
will be created from verified NAFLD associated variants effect and assessed for its ability to
predict, steatosis, cirrhosis, HCC. We will annotate verified NAFLD associated variants to
identify target genes for follow up functional studies for effects on steatosis alone and in
combination. Results from this work will help define the genetic and metabolic mechanisms that
cause NAFLD and inform development of new biomarkers as well as potential therapeutics for
this condition."

Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a blinding disease world-wide, but for unknown reasons, persons
from West Africa and of West African descent including African-Americans are at disproportionate risk.
Dysfunction in aqueous humor outflow may lead to elevated IOP, which, if left untreated, can cause
blindness. Yet, very little is known about this disease in African Americans. Therefore elucidation of IOP
regulation in African Americans is a major hurdle that must be overcome before therapeutics for the treatment
of POAG in this population can be developed. Genome-wide association study (GWAS), identified a unique
genetic risk allele, the FMNL2 gene in African Americans with POAG. The FMNL2 gene encodes the formin-
related protein-2 (FMNL2) that modulates TM cell actin stress fiber assembly, thus regulating TM contractility
and IOP. Another protein, Cdc42-Rho GTPase regulates FMNL2 function. Contraction and relaxation of the
TM cells help to regulate IOP. Collectively, these findings suggest that FMNL2 dysfunction is likely to alter
actin stress fiber assembly and contribute to POAG. Given that scientific premise, the overall goal of this
grant to elucidate the cellular, molecular and biochemical mechanisms that regulate IOP in African Americans
aimed at identifying novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of glaucoma in that population. Our objective
is to determine how FMNL2 regulates the TM cell contractile apparatus and thus modulates IOP in African
Americans. Our global hypothesis is that dysfunction in FMNL2 in the African American population decreases
aqueous humor outflow and results in the development of POAG. The specific aims will test these
hypotheses: (Aim 1) Dysfunction of FMNL2 gene disrupts TM cell actin stress fibers and aqueous humor
outflow, causing glaucoma in African Americans. (Aim 2) Cdc42-Rho GTPase signaling pathway regulates
FMNL2-mediated TM contractility. In vitro and in vivo studies using human tissues will be utilized to
investigate the mechanism of IOP regulation in African Americans. This project is novel and significant and
its completion would for the first time, demonstrate in African Americans, 1) an IOP-regulatory mechanism,
2) a functional role for the FMNL2 gene in regulating physiological IOP and 3) a causative role for the FMNL2
risk allele gene in glaucoma. Identification of Cdc42-Rho GTPase/FMNL2 signaling pathway in African
Americans will provide new therapeutic targets for the development of treatments for glaucoma in African
Americans and other persons of West African descent that are at a high risk for development of the disease."
10795138,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hypoxia is a condition in which the body is deprived of an adequate supply of oxygen which can
lead to severe damage to various tissues and organs and can have serious implications for the health and
well-being of the affected individual. Exposure to high altitudes is a common cause of hypoxia; populations
who permanently reside at high altitudes are exposed to chronic hypoxia, while populations only visiting
high altitudes for a short period are exposed to acute hypoxia. High-altitude human populations and certain
animal models have been extensively utilized to examine physiological changes associated with rapid
plastic responses to acute hypoxia and long-term adaptive response to chronic hypoxia. Recent genomic
studies of high-altitude human populations have provided key insights into the genetic basis of long-term
adaptation to hypoxia. E.g., genetic variations in the genes associated with hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs)
pathways are known to play a critical role in the chronic hypoxia response. While the genetic basis of long-
term adaptation to hypoxia is well studied, we still have a limited understanding of the underlying genomic
regulation associated with plastic response to acute hypoxia. In addition, little is known about how the
duration and frequency of hypoxia exposure may play a role in such plastic and adaptive responses. Thus,
the working hypothesis of this proposal is that the plastic and adaptive response to hypoxia may vary
according to the amount of time an individual spends under hypoxic conditions. To test this hypothesis, we
will study birds residing across the elevational gradient in the Himalayas and Tibetan plateau that
demonstrate natural acclimation/adaptation to acute/chronic hypoxia. We propose two specific aims: the
first aim will quantify intra- and inter-species changes in hematological traits associated with chronic
hypoxia and study the genomics/transcriptomics profiles in low/high altitude residents and altitudinal
migrants to identify the underlying genetic basis of physiological traits associated with long-term adaptation
to hypoxia. The second aim will expose birds to their “non-native” elevation via transplantation experiments
and measure plasticity in hematological traits and gene expression profiles to identify gene regulatory
mechanisms associated with rapid acclimation to acute hypoxia. The proposed research is scientifically
important because understanding the genetic basis of acute and chronic hypoxia responses has implications
for human health. The data generated from the proposed study will provide critical insights into the genetic
factors associated with short and long-term hypoxia exposure that can be used to infer risk factors of
multiple diseases associated with hypoxia and identify potential targets for drug development."
10796514,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cellular biology of the human gastroesophageal junction cardia (GEJ-cardia) has been notoriously difficult to
study, in particular due to a lack of biologically relevant GEJ-cardia-specific disease models. Based on known
early genetic events in GEJ-cardia neoplasia, we generated wild-type (WT) and TP53/CDKN2A dual-knockout
(DKO) 3-dimensional (3D) human GEJ-cardia-derived organoids using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. Notably,
DKO organoids grew faster, became larger, exhibited de novo intestinal, metaplastic and dysplastic morphology,
and consistently grew as xenografts in vivo. Interestingly, 2-D MALDI mass spectrometric imaging revealed a
markedly abnormal lipidomic profile in DKO organoids, with platelet-activating factor (PTAF) and free fatty acids
(FFAs) among the most-upregulated lipids. Intriguingly, several of these FFAs (stearic acid, lauric acid, cyclo
acid, oleic acid, and palmitate) function as known ligands that stimulate HNF4A, a centrally important master
transcription factor (MTF) implicated during early GEJ-cardia neoplastic evolution.
We hypothesize that dysregulated FFA metabolism, acting via a novel lipid-epigenome crosstalk featuring MTF
hyperactivation, causes abnormal growth, proliferation and differentiation at the human GEJ-cardia. This
hypothesis will be tested by two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will first assess the biological effects of PTAF-
PTAFR signaling in our early GEJ neoplasia organoid model, using either loss- or gain-of-function approaches,
followed by an examination of phenotypes, morphology, and differentiation of GEJ-cardia organoids. Similarly,
potential functions of candidate FFAs will be interrogated in GEJ-cardia organoids. Furthermore, we will establish
the in vivo etiologic role of PTAF-PTAFR signaling as well as candidate FFAs in early GEJ-cardia neoplasia. In
Aim 2, we will explore a novel crosstalk between lipid metabolism and epigenomic reprogramming by
investigating the functional contributions of FFAs and PTAF to the epigenomic activity of HNF4A. Direct binding
of FFAs and PTAF to HNF4A will be measured by competitive radiometric binding assays. The functional
regulation by HNF4A of GEJ-cardia chromatin accessibility and activity will be interrogated using a palette of
epigenomic sequencing approaches. Finally, we will perform spatial quantification of the abundance of HNF4A-
activating FFAs and PTAF in both GEJ-cardia organoids and primary patient samples by conducting advanced
histopathology-guided MALDI imaging analyses.
These efforts in toto promise to define biological drivers promoting early GEJ-cardia neoplastic evolution and to
elucidate a novel crosstalk between lipid metabolism and epigenomic reprogramming, thereby discovering
precise molecular mechanisms underpinning GEJ-cardia dysplasia and early neoplastic transformation.
Moreover, this project has the potential to uncover and validate candidate approaches toward prevention and
early intervention in GEJ-cardia neoplastic evolution by targeting PTAFR, which may ultimately be effectively
blocked by an FDA-approved pharmacologic antagonist in human patients."
10800521,"PROJECT SUMMARY – INVESTIGATOR DEVELOPMENT CORE
The primary goal of the Investigator Development Core (IDC) is to support the career development of post-
doctoral fellows, junior faculty, and early-stage investigators in the area of prostate cancer research. In addition,
the objectives of the IDC are to engage researchers across disciplines to promote interdisciplinary collaborations
and address prostate cancer disparities from biological and social perspectives. The Center for Cancer Research
and Therapeutic Development faculty members have complementary and integrated expertise and
demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments in prostate cancer research. The program will support two
pilot projects each year from a strong pipeline of pilot project applications with a potential pool of twenty
prospective investigators who require funding to generate data for application to external granting agencies. A
scientific committee will evaluate the pilot project proposals through a peer-review process before funding the
projects. Also, the project-specific committee will provide mentoring support to pilot project recipients to promote
their projects’ success. The proposed pilot projects are consistent with the NIH’s Roadmap for Medical Research,
which acknowledges integrating behavioral and social science research with biological research in addressing
health disparities. The proposed activities will strongly support the career development and enhancement of the
competitiveness of diverse investigators, particularly early-stage investigators, in basic biomedical and
behavioral sciences. In addition, the proposed plan for soliciting and evaluating research proposals, prioritizing
projects, and monitoring their performance in achieving project goals will further enhance the investigator
development and research capacity at Clark Atlantan University."

 Multiple clinical trials have shown that combining anti-estrogen therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy
improves progression-free survival in ER+/HER2- breast cancer patients. However, many patients are resistant
to CDK4/6 inhibitors or acquire resistance within the first few months of treatment. Interestingly, histological
staining of treated tumors reveals a small but consistent population of cells in the proliferative phase of the cell
cycle—a phenomenon we refer to as fractional resistance. It is critical to understand the mechanistic basis for
fractional resistance because the precise fraction of proliferating tumor cells (e.g., 2% versus 15%) is a strong
predictor of patient outcomes. Recent single-cell studies have shown that individual cells can take distinct
trajectories, or “paths”, through the cell cycle that are defined by a unique combination of molecular states over
time. We hypothesize that fractional resistance in breast tumors occurs because cells can take multiple paths
through the cell cycle, but only some of these paths are sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors. To test this hypothesis,
we have developed a powerful new method to profile >50 cell cycle regulator proteins in single cells. By linking
single-cell states together, computationally, this approach has revealed how individual cells take alternate
paths to evade cell cycle-targeted therapy. In Aim 1, we will induce fractional resistance in a panel of breast
tumor models by applying increasing doses of CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy to gradually eliminate
subpopulations of proliferating tumor cells, thereby defining the range of molecular states cells can reach under
drug treatment. Preliminary work suggests that resistant cells must take a particular set of paths at the G1/S
transition characterized by high ratios of cyclins (e.g., cyclin D/E) to CDK inhibitors (e.g., p21/p27); altered
CDT1 expression; and elevated E2F1 levels. We will validate these predictions through time-lapse microscopy.
Aim 2 will take an unbiased approach to determine changes to the global protein landscape in response to
increasing doses of endocrine/CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. Using deep, quantitative proteomics that combines
massive offline peptide fractionation with tandem mass tag labeling, we will determine changes to the protein
landscape in response to CDK4/6 inhibition; validate these changes biochemically and by imaging; and
determine the impact of the molecular state changes on sensitivity or resistance to endocrine/CDK4/6 inhibitor
therapy. New preliminary results show multiple candidate regulators (e.g., CDKN3, UHRF1) that are cell cycle -
dependent or expressed in fractionally resistant subpopulations. Aim 3 will identify resistant paths in resected
human tumors—a technique developed by our surgical team. In addition, we will test the fractional resistance
hypothesis in three ER+/HER2- PDX models to assess the extent of fractional resistance in long term,
physiologically relevant model. Overall, this project will provide new knowledge in how heterogeneity in cell
cycle behaviors leads to fractional drug resistance in ER+/HER2- tumors; identify novel resistance factors; and
pave the way for the development of next-generation biomarkers that capture the unique cell cycle behaviors
and drug sensitivities in other cancer types."

 Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in American men. The National Cancer Institute estimated
that there would be ~268,490 new cases of prostate cancer and ~34,500 deaths from prostate cancer within the
United States for 2022. Despite the development of second-generation hormonal therapies (e.g., enzalutamide)
and targeted poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (e.g., olaparib), the mortality of prostate cancer
remains high as intrinsic and acquired drug resistance is common to all these agents, and many patients develop
incurable metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) within 2–3 years.
 Accumulating evidence and our preliminary data show that mCRPC cells deficient in homologous
recombination repair (HRR) activities due to genetic mutations of DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1/2, or due
to the enzalutamide treatment-induced BRCAness state are particularly vulnerable to disruption of DNA-damage
tolerance pathways, such as the mutagenic translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). TLS is a fundamental cellular
defense mechanism that enables DNA replication across lesion sites under replication stress in order to promote
cell survival at the cost of replication fidelity.
 The eukaryotic Y-family polymerase Rev1 is an essential scaffolding protein in TLS, and the interaction
between its C-terminal domain (CTD) with translesion polymerase z is absolutely required for function. Aided by
our structural elucidation of the Rev1-bridged translesionsome complex in TLS, we have identified the first-in-
class in vivo active small molecule inhibitor, JH-RE-06, that disrupts TLS by directly binding to the Rev1 CTD to
block the Rev1 interaction with the Rev7 component of polymerase z. JH-RE-06 suppresses spontaneous and
treatment-induced mutagenesis in cells and sensitizes cancer cells to a variety of DNA-damaging agents both
in vitro and in a murine xenograft tumor model. Recently, we have shown that mCRPC cells in the BRCAness
state are particularly vulnerable to JH-RE-06 inhibition. The goal of this proposal is to further characterize JH-
RE-06 and derivatives in prostate cancer cells, optimize their potency, safety, and other pharmacological
properties, and demonstrate their effectiveness in treating mCRPC and suppressing acquired drug resistance in
murine tumor models. The successful execution of the proposal will profoundly alter the existing paradigm of
lethal prostate cancer treatment by providing effective means to overcome intrinsic and acquired drug resistance,
thus improving the outcomes for patients with lethal prostate cancer."
10809571,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To devise novel treatments for craniofacial birth defects, disease, and injuries, more research is needed to
understand developmental mechanisms that control jaw length. The jaws often display a range of size-related
anomalies including mandibular hypoplasia, retrognathia, asymmetry, and clefting. Our study will provide critical
data to address this unmet need by focusing on how jaw length is regulated during the deposition and resorption
of bone. We employ a unique quail-duck chimeric system that we created for manipulating neural crest
mesenchyme (NCM), which are the precursor cells that form the jaw skeleton. Quail have much shorter jaws
than do duck. Transplanting NCM between quail and duck embryos generates chimeras with the jaw length of
the donor species, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which NCM accomplishes this complex
task remain largely unknown. In our published and preliminary studies, we uncover a direct correlation between
jaw length and the NCM-mediated expression of ligands, receptors, and effectors of the Transforming Growth
Factor-Beta (Tgfβ) pathway, which is known to promote bone deposition and resorption. We observe that Tgfβ
receptor 1 (Tgfβr1), and targets including an osteogenic factor (Runx2) as well as a bone-resorbing collagenase
(Mmp13) are highly upregulated in quail compared to duck. If we over-express Runx2 or Mmp13, we shorten the
jaw whereas inhibiting Mmp13 lengthens the jaw. We also find species-specific variation in Runx2 isoforms and
in the promoters of Tgfβr1 and Mmp13. Thus, we hypothesize that multiple hierarchical levels of gene regulation
in the TgfFβ pathway generate species-specific differences in sensitivity to TGFβ signaling, modulate bone
deposition and resorption, and enable NCM to control jaw length. To test our hypothesis, we propose three
complementary Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which NCM utilizes differential expression
of Tgfβr1 to control Tgfβ pathway activation, bone deposition and resorption, and jaw length. We will identify
species-specific regulatory elements and assay for cell-autonomous versus context-dependent mechanisms that
affect Tgfβr1 expression. In Aim 2, we will determine the extent to which NCM deploys combinatorial, spatial,
temporal, and/or species-specific expression of Runx2 isoforms to regulate targets, bone deposition and
resorption, and jaw length. We will identify developmental contexts in which Runx2 is alternatively spliced and
use gain- and loss-of-function approaches to interrogate the ability of Runx2 isoforms to control bone growth. In
Aim 3, we will determine the extent to which NCM leverages species-specific differences in Mmp13 regulation
to modulate jaw length. We will manipulate upstream transcriptional inputs and endogenous promoter elements
of Mmp13 and use gain- and loss-of-function strategies to test if regulatory changes to Mmp13 provide spatial
and temporal control over local resorption and growth of bone. Each Specific Aim is clinically relevant in providing
data on critical stages and mechanisms that could be targeted via novel molecular therapies to benefit patients
with jaw length defects. Currently invasive surgery and/or orthodontics are the only treatment options."

A diverse U.S. biomedical research workforce is essential for developing innovation in basic, translational and
clinical research and healthcare and is necessary for improving the nation’s health. The NIH has identified key
issues contributing to the disproportionate representation of underrepresented individuals in the biomedical
workforce, including lack of effective mentoring, guidance in research and career development, and access to
professional networks. The overall goal of the UC San Diego Future Faculty of Cardiovascular Sciences
(FOCUS) Program is to establish long-term effective mentorship and training of early career faculty and
transitioning postdocs from underrepresented backgrounds in critical academic skills to enhance research
success and in obtaining independent NIH or equivalent funding. The program will be led by two Principal
Investigators (PIs) and two co-Investigators (co-Is). The PIs/co-Is have a long history of mentoring and training
early career faculty and success in designing, implementing and directing career development and mentoring
programs specifically for underrepresented mentees. All PIs/co-Is have successfully led extramurally funded
training programs; three of the four PIs/co-Is are actively engaged in NIH-sponsored cardiovascular research
and two PIs/co-Is are from underrepresented backgrounds. The goal and objectives of the UCSD FOCUS
Program are to use evidence-based strategies and asset models to enhance the success of underrepresented
early career faculty in developing competitive research programs and obtaining independent extramural research
funding. The proposed program for each of the four cohorts entering FOCUS will meet the objectives by
providing effective mentorship and training in areas that are unique challenges for early career researchers,
especially from underrepresented backgrounds. We hypothesize that early career faculty participants immersed
in the UCSD FOCUS Program will obtain strong mentorship, academic career development and leadership skills,
as well as excellent guidance in grantsmanship and research development, that will improve their success in
obtaining NIH or equivalent funding. We propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1) To continue to recruit UR early
career faculty and transitioning postdoctoral fellows who have cardiovascular scientific expertise aligned with
those of our research mentors, carefully selected based on their research and mentorship excellence. Aim 2)
To continue to use evidence-based strategies to enhance professional development and effective mentorship of
the early career faculty participants. Aim 3) To continue to promote research self-efficacy by immersing
participants in effective strategies to: a) develop robust and innovative research programs, b) acquire improved
skills in writing effective grant proposals and manuscripts, and c) understand the process and importance of
submitting, revising and reviewing journal articles and grants. Together the aims proposed in the renewal of the
UCSD FOCUS Program will continue to increase underrepresented faculty participants’ ability to conduct
innovative research, obtain independent NIH or equivalent funding, and attain academic success."

We move our eyes thousands of times each day, adding up to over an hour of our waking perception. These
eye movements create considerable difficulties for the brain’s visual processing system, which must suppress
the induced motion of the visual scene caused by the eye movement and provide a stable visual perception
despite these discontinuities. How the visual system deals with the potentially disruptive consequences of our
frequent eye movements is a question with direct relevance for our everyday visual perception, and especially
to disorders in which eye movements are abnormal or the integration of information is impaired, such as
schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorders; the integration of
information across eye movements may be particularly important in reading, and potentially impaired in mental
disorders such as dyslexia. Aim 1 of this proposal develops a novel statistical approach capable of producing
an encoding model which captures the fast changes in neural sensitivity around the time of eye movements,
and linking this activity to a perceptual readout. This approach reveals a novel neurophysiological
phenomenon—persistent activity in response to stimuli appearing near the time of the saccade—which
contributes to integrating the visual scene across saccades. In Aim 2, we apply the same modelling framework
to the phenomenon of perceived changes in the location of visual stimuli around the time of saccades, and
measure this phenomenon behaviorally in nonhuman primates. The impact of Frontal Eye Field (FEF) activity
on the modulation of extrastriate neuronal responses during eye movements is causally tested using
pharmacological manipulation in Aim 3. The combination of psychophysical, electrophysiological,
computational, and causal manipulation techniques used in this proposal promises an unprecedented level of
insight into how our brain actively reconstructs the visual world three times a second to provide us with a stable
sense of the visual world during eye movements."

metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data generation, and best-in-class bioinformatic analysis. We will optimize
our protocols for DNA and RNA extraction from stool, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic library preparation,
sequencing, and bioinformatics for ultra-high resolution taxonomic and functional profiling of the microbiome,
including bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. We will offer analytical services and expertise on study
design, sample collection, statistics, artificial intelligence, and host-microbe data interpretation to support other
NPH centers and develop standard operation procedures with the Research Coordinating Center (RCC). Our
team has developed uniquely innovative approaches to provide metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data at a
cost that facilitates application to all 17,500 samples provided by the BioBank, with robust quality control to
ensure high-quality raw and processed data products. We are also able to provide absolute quantification of
microbial load through our recent innovation in synthetic DNA ‘spike-ins', which also facilitates rigorous
assessment of contamination and extraction efficiency. Beyond bringing cutting edge technology that we have
developed to the consortium, we also propose 3 Pilot Projects: (i) long-read data assembly; (ii) multiplexed
metaproteomics; and (iii) automated stool sample collection and processing, so as to improve the taxonomic and
functional resolution of profiling and improve biomarker detection sensitivity using dense timeseries. Importantly,
our team is also optimally positioned to develop community consensus for the analysis strategies agreed on
during the planning year, as well as to address the challenges of integrating microbiome data into the NPH
consortium, due to our: existing high-throughput sample processing, sequencing, and data analysis cores; tight
integration among disciplinary groups; access to supercomputing infrastructure; data visualization expertise; and
tight coordination with an international braintrust of scientists who have been selected based on their
complementary expertise in different areas of microbiome and precision nutrition research. This center will also
benefit from cross-campus institutional commitment to provide 4 undergraduate, 5 postgraduate, and 6
postdoctoral fellowships, enabling faculty engagement and the development of innovative technologies and
algorithms to advance NPH consortium goals. Additionally, our existing community outreach experiences can
further support the NPH consortium’s goal to provide respectful, accessible and engaging feedback to the

10813786,"Project Summary
Overt metastases are often diagnosed years after the removal of primary breast tumors, indicating the existence
of systemically disseminated tumor cells or microscopic metastases. Adjuvant therapies have been designed to
eliminate these cells. Although significant advances were made, a substantial proportion of patients still develop
overt metastases, accounting for over 90% of breast cancer-related deaths. How micrometastases resume
aggressive outgrowth and become incurable overt metastases remains poorly understood. Our long-term goals
are to elucidate the biology underlying the survival and progression of microscopic metastases and to design
therapeutic strategies against these latent tumor cells. The overall objective of this project is to investigate how
tissue homeostasis of the bone, the organ most frequently affected by metastatic breast cancer, dictates the fate
of bone micrometastases (BMM). Bone and bone marrow comprise of several highly distinctive
microenvironment niches. Dormant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) may reside in the perivascular niche,
whereas proliferative BMM were found in the osteogenic niche that exhibit features of active osteogenesis (the
bone-making process). It remains elusive how cancer cells are relocated from one niche to another, and switch
their fates from dormancy to outgrowth. In search for such mechanism, we observed an interesting “migration-
by-tethering” phenomenon: cancer cells can adhere to osteogenic cells such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
through a dendritic spine-like structure (DSLS) that is highly pliable and elastic. Like dormant DTCs, resting
MSCs also localize in perivascular niches. Turnover of bone tissues releases signals to mobilize and chemo-
attracted MSCs to sites needing osteogenesis, thereby providing a possible vehicle for cancer cells to “ride” and
relocate from the perivascular niche to the osteogenic niche. The subsequent differentiation of MSCs will then
fuel the development of the osteogenic niche, and directly promoting metastasis progression. These findings
lead us to hypothesize that the bone turnover process may recruit both osteogenic cells and DTCs via a
“migration-by-tethering” mechanism, and foster the development of osteogenic niche to pro-mote bone
colonization. We will test these hypotheses by pursuing the following specific aims. Aim 1. To molecularly dissect
the “migration-by-tethering” mechanism and determine its role in the development of the osteogenic niche and
early-stage bone colonization of DTCs. Aim 2. To determine the impact of perturbations of bone turnover on
bone metastasis, and assess how this impact is mediated by the “migration-by-tethering” mechanism that recruits
DTCs to the osteogenic niche. The proposed research will have impact at multiple levels. At a cellular level, it
will elucidate how cell migration can occur with assistance of microenvironment cells but without acquisition of
cancer-intrinsic migratory traits. At a physiological and pathological level, it will establish connections between
bone homeostasis and bone metastasis, reveal etiology of late-onset bone recurrences, and provide therapeutic
insights."

The University of Rochester (UR) and Duke University will establish a Translational Center for Barrier MPS
(TRaCe-bMPS) to create drug development tools (DDTs) focused on the role of barrier functions in disease,
injury, and infection. The overall goal of the Center is to submit full qualification packages to the FDA for five
DDTs relevant to the treatment of: 1) central nervous system (CNS) disorders, 2) fibrosis, 3) musculoskeletal
autoimmune disease, 4) sepsis, and 5) osteomyelitis. For each DDT we have assembled an experienced and
multidisciplinary team to establish reproducibility of biomarker assessments for clinically important contexts of
use (CoU). Each DDT will be based on an existing, validated MPS model and leverage the modular µSiM
MPS platform which provides design flexibility along with translationally relevant permeability and imaging at
the interface between tissue compartments.
The TRaCe-bMPS will comprise: 1) a Qualification Program (QP), 2) a Resource Core (RC), and 3) an
Administrative Core (AC). These units will work together to achieve the Center’s five-year mission while
establishing sustainability through commercialization, collaboration, and resource sharing. The QP will
develop DDTs and standard operating procedures (SOPs) and achieve answer-in-sample-out functionality
through live cell imaging and integrated sensor technologies. Reproducibility for each DDT will be established
in at least two laboratories. Qualification plans and packages will be submitted to the FDA in a collaboration
between regulatory scientists at UR and Duke. Working with manufacturers, the RC will qualify every DDT
component before distribution to development teams. The RC will also advance DDTs to arrayed formats that
are compatible with automated plate readers and liquid handlers. The AC will include an Executive Committee
that will direct the Center with input from stakeholders, including pharmaceutical companies who will define
end user needs. The AC will also manage formal reporting and other interactions with the NIH, FDA, and the
NCATS center hub.
The dysregulated transport of cells and molecules between tissues is the underlying cause of many diseases
and is applicable to the development of drug programs. Additionally, the delivery of drugs to affected tissues
depends on the ability to cross these barriers. Despite the fundamental significance of tissue barriers in
medicine, most microphysiological systems (MPS) do not provide reliable access to quantitative assessments
cellular and molecular exchanges at tissue barriers. By focusing on DDTs specially designed to provide these
metrics, the TRaCe-bMPS addresses an unmet need in drug development. This focus, along with the unique

efficiently manage and coordinate the Center’s research activities in the Resource Core (RC) and the
Qualification Program (QP) in coordination with data management resources at the UR and Duke Clinical
Translational Science Institutes (CTSI).
The AC provides innovative governance and data flow between the operational units (RC and QP) in at least
two aspects. First, the multi-PI approach in the Executive Committee breaks with the traditional hierarchical
model and allows for deliberative, flexible, and nimble decision-making while fostering communications and
collaborations among the operational arms of the team. Second, the AC's oversight of the integration of data
sets generated by each of the DDTs in the RC is critical. This function ensures that the data is consistently
processed and ready for use in creating validation and qualification documents by the RC and QP,
respectively. The seamless integration of data is essential to achieving the overall research objectives and
ensuring that the TRaCe-bMPS delivers on its milestones.
The AC will aim to: 1) strategically manage the TRaCe-bMPS through an Executive Committee, which will be
in charge of overall governance including administration of personnel, financial oversight, and quality controls
on services and progress of the qualification processes through evaluations at periodically scheduled
meetings; 2) establish relevant scientific expertise on the team and progress towards project aims; 3) foster
communications between TRaCe-bMPS Resource Core and Qualifications Program investigators, as well as
other stakeholders including the NCATS/NIH program staff, the FDA, an Advisory Board, consultants, and
industry and pharma partners; 4) provide oversight over data management and integration for all data sets
generated by the RC for each of the DDTs to facilitate seamless utilization by the QP in preparing validation
and qualification documents; and 5) establish long-term sustainability plans beyond the funding period,
including plans for IP and commercialization."

10814022,"ABSTRACT
The goals of the MPS Qualification Program for the TRaCe-bMPS is to develop five FDA qualified drug
development tools (DDTs) that provide functional information important to the evaluation of drugs targeting tissue
barrier function in disease. Transport of cells and molecules across an interface (or barrier) between tissues is a
critical step in infection and inflammation and a key target in drug development. The ideal platform for the
discovery and efficacy studies of drugs targeting barrier function should have the following features: use
extremely thin, highly permeable and optically transparent membranes to support the culture of cells and
deposition of natural or synthetic extracellular matrix; enable culture of multiple cell types, provide measurement
of multiple outputs; offer the ability to make measurements over time using the same system; have the capability
of exposing tissue structures to physical forces, and enable multiplexing for medium throughput applications.
Existing commercial systems including the gold standard TranswellTM and tissue chips sold by Emulate, Mimetas,
and SynVivo, suffer limitations that prevent them from being the general solution to a barrier function based DDT.
The core technology of the TRaCe-bMPS is a modular platform, known as the µSiM (microphysiological system
featuring a silicon membrane) that has the ideal characteristics of a barrier-based platform while being scalable,
flexible, and reliable in addressing this unmet need. For the qualification process in the TRaCe-bMPS, we will
establish the following DDTs to assess the efficacy of drugs targeting barriers relevant to the treatment of: 1)
central nervous system (CNS) disorders, 2) fibrosis, 3) musculoskeletal autoimmune disease, 4) sepsis, and 5)
osteomyelitis. To advance these DDTs towards qualification, we will (1) place all systems within a common
platform that can be used in a multi-well format amenable to moderate throughput (12-24 well assays) using a
common microscopy and imaging system; (2) validate using a set of current drug treatments known to affect
specific pathways for the MPS disease models; (3) establish a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs);
and (4) establish reproducibility by having two laboratories obtain results following the SOP. We will then prepare
and submit FDA qualification packages for each of the five DDTs. Completion of these aims will provide qualified
DDTs with advanced functional assays using well-characterized human cells that will enable critical insight into
the role specific drugs on barrier and tissue function and lead to community adoption. We expect that the
qualification process will uncover additional needs to evaluate functional outcomes, leading to new or modified
MPS that address each of these context of use cases."
10811971,"Project Summary/Abstract
The current proposal is to support a Summer Undergraduate Research Program in Neuroscience
(NeuroSURP) mentored by Rutgers University research faculty. The program has three primary aims: (1) To
increase student knowledge and appreciation of basic biological research by providing a closely-mentored,
hands-on research experience; (2) To increase student knowledge and interest in pursuing careers in research
through career development and educational activities; (3) To provide continued advice, support and guidance
to program alumni to facilitate post-program career planning and implementation. Twelve undergraduates will
be admitted to our program each year beginning 2024. Special consideration will be given to students from
historically underrepresented minority and disadvantaged backgrounds including Black, Hispanic, Native
American, Pacific Islander, or have physical or mental disabilities, or are from economically and/or socially
disadvantaged backgrounds (collectively referred to as URM) that comprise a deep and diverse pool of
potential future scientists. The research component of the proposed SURP involves hands-on experimentation
in labs with active, nationally recognized and funded research programs in neuroscience with a focus on
neurological disorders at Rutgers University. The infrastructure and general organization of the proposed
program will be based on an existing program that has been in place for 27 years. Students will work on their
own research projects under the close supervision of mentors in their host labs. The proposed SURP is
designed to integrate student research experiences and mentoring with weekly meetings comprising training in
neuroscience, oral and written presentations, critical reading of manuscripts, Responsible Conduct of
Research as well as Rigor and Reproducibility including statistical analysis. In addition, there is a significant
career development component during the weekly meetings in which PhD, MD/PhD and MD guest speakers
discuss their career paths representing academic research, non-academic research as well as research-
related careers. Each year students will present the results of their summer research projects in a symposium
that is open to scientists on campus and members of the general public. In addition, the students submit a
paper on their project in the format of a manuscript and receive feedback from MPIs. Finally, the Co-directors
will maintain close contact with the alumni of our program as we have done for the past 27 years and will
continue to provide them with advice and mentoring related to applying to graduate school and their careers.
The mentors who will be supervising the students study neurological disorders including Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, autism, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, sensory loss, epilepsy, and
stroke. The multidisciplinary research focus of the faculty mentors on the cellular, molecular, and genetic
processes underlying developmental and degeneration of the nervous system has implications for the etiology,
pathogenesis and progression of neurological disorders."
10812070,"Title: Investigate the Role of Gut Microbiota in the Development of Type 1 Diabetes Using TEDDY Study
Project Abstract:
Gut dysbiosis in early childhood might cause or contribute to early-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D). The
Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study has established a nested case–control
(NCC) microbiome study for islet autoimmunity (IA) and T1D, which provides an opportunity to study microbial
factors involved in T1D development. However, only limited, subtle microbial associations with IA or T1D have
been detected in TEDDY so far, possibly because the longitudinal microbiome data have been analyzed in cross-
sectional fashion, neglecting the heterogeneity of the disease.
We hypothesize that temporal changes in gut microbiota in various microbiome maturation phases are
associated with the development of T1D as delineated by four distinct IA phenotypes and overt T1D. We propose
to develop two novel joint modeling tools that integrate longitudinal microbiome measurements and times to
onset of IA phenotypes and T1D and to implement these methods in a secondary analysis of TEDDY microbiome
data. Our new tools will embrace unique challenges presented by TEDDY’s NCC longitudinal microbiome study.
We have three aims. 1) Identify microbial biomarkers for specific IA phenotypes. We propose a novel joint
modeling framework under the NCC study design to characterize the association between time-varying microbial
abundances and the onset of specific IA phenotypes. We will apply the proposed statistical method to TEDDY
data to pinpoint which microbial biomarkers, either taxonomically or functionally, are associated with the
occurrence of specific IA phenotypes. 2) Identify microbial biomarkers that predict the risk of progression from
IA to T1D. We will extend the statistical method to allow for the modeling of two-stage T1D progression (from
birth to the onset of IA, and from onset of IA to overt T1D) and the discovery of microbial biomarkers that predict
T1D progression using TEDDY data. 3) Evaluate and refine these statistical methods and disseminate
companion software to the community.
The proposed new methods will allow us to discover novel microbial biomarkers for each IA phenotype and T1D
in the TEDDY study, broadening our understanding of the cause of T1D and ultimately promoting the
development of new strategies to prevent or delay the disease."

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) a highly heritable neurodevelopmental condition characterized
by inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Individuals with ADHD are at a higher risk for addictive
behavior during adolescence including excessive alcohol consumption and are more likely to developing an
alcohol use disorder (AUD). Epidemiological and genetic studies indicate that ADHD and AUD have high rates
of comorbidity and share several risk-associated genes, inferring a common underlying endophenotype.
Neuroimaging studies of individuals with ADHD demonstrate delayed brain maturation particularly in the frontal
cortex. Heavy drinking during adolescence also disrupts frontal cortex development, leading to accelerated
loss of grey matter. Thus, it is likely that ADHD is likely exacerbated by heavy alcohol use during adolescence,
perpetuating ADHD and AUD symptoms in adulthood. Despite the high prevalence of ADHD individuals that
suffer from comorbid AUD, we know very little about ADHD predisposition and the impact of adolescent alcohol
exposure on frontal cortex function. To better understand the underlying neurobiology of ADHD as well as the
relationship between cognitive dysfunction and adolescent alcohol consumption, we will evaluate measures of
cognitive control and alcohol self-administration in a prominent mouse genetic model of ADHD, the Lphn3
knockout mouse. Latrophillin 3 (LPHN3) is a synaptic cell adhesion G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)
involved in forming and maintaining glutamatergic synapses. Loss of function variants in LPHN3 have a strong
genetic association with ADHD and have been shown to be a significant risk factor for developing an AUD. We
propose a two hit model, where ADHD symptom severity can be worsened by adolescent binge drinking and
promote heavy alcohol consumption in adulthood. By focusing on frontal corticothalamic (CT) circuitry known
to mediate attention, working memory and impulsivity, we can evaluate the specific neural mechanisms
affected by adolescent alcohol and loss of Lphn3. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that
genetic deletion of Lphn3 in the frontal cortex causes reductions in glutamate neurotransmission and that
binge-like alcohol consumption during adolescence exacerbates this effect using ex vivo electrophysiology and
spine density measurements of specific subpopulations within frontal cortex. In Aim 2, we will test the
hypothesis that Lphn3 and adolescent alcohol consumption negatively affects cognitive control and that
specific neural circuits in the frontal cortex regulate these deficits. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that
Lphn3 deletion and adolescent alcohol consumption potentiate the reinforcing and motivational properties of
alcohol in a frontal CT circuit manner. Results from these studies will provide valuable information on the
interactions of alcohol with ADHD and potentially reveal novel interventions for problematic drinking in ADHD
individuals."
10812127,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose an innovative approach to antagonize the androgen receptor (AR) by displaying AR ligands on a
peptoid scaffold. This new family of molecules, called multivalent peptoid conjugates (MPCs), potently stops
the growth of prostate cancer cells resistant to treatment by standard anti-androgen agents such as
enzalutamide. Peptoids are small protein-like chains, but unlike polypeptides, they are protease resistant and
thus exhibit improved pharmacologic stability, favorable solubility, and cell permeability characteristics, making
them an attractive option for drug development. Our published and preliminary studies show that MPCs deter
prostate cancer growth by antagonizing the proliferative response of AR. We propose that MPCs promote a
novel AR conformation that drives a different pattern of AR-mediated gene expression compared to DHT or
enzalutamide resulting in a block to cell proliferation by the gain and loss of AR occupancy at select genomic
sites. We will perform ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and ChIP-mass spec to identify MPC target genes and the
coregulatory factors controlling their expression compared to enzalutamide and DHT in enzalutamide-resistant
cells.
In addition, MPCs can promote immune cell infiltration in treated xenograft prostate tumors, which could
potentiate a cytotoxic T cell response and enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), allowing
the patient’s immune system to fight tumor growth. The inadequacy of available immune checkpoint blockade
strategies is an obstacle to treating advanced prostate cancer. We will determine whether MPCs can promote
anti-tumor immunity and sensitize tumors to ICB treatment. Therefore, another goal of this proposal will be to
assess whether MPC309 can synergize with ICB antibodies in treating CRPC.
We will also conduct X-ray crystallography studies to establish the mechanism of action of MPC309 with AR.
This will provide insights into the molecular interactions between MCP309 and AR and will be used to guide
the design of more potent and selective MPCs optimized for AR antagonism. Thus, MPCs can stop the growth
of prostate cancer cells that have adapted to treatment by developing drug resistance and have the potential to
lead to the development of novel and effective therapies for patients with advanced prostate cancer."

More than 50% of smokers attempt to quit smoking each year, but even with intensive treatment the
overwhelming majority will return to smoking within six months. Given over 480,000 deaths each year in the
United States alone are directly attributable to smoking, there is a tremendous need for improved smoking
cessation interventions. β-adrenergic receptor antagonists have received substantial attention as a potential
treatment for addiction across both pre-clinical and clinical models. Traditional smoking cessation medications
are very effective for alleviating nicotine withdrawal but much less effective at addressing the influence of
environmental cues on smoking behavior. One key advantage of β-adrenergic drugs is that they target a
different mechanism than established treatments, acting to directly curb the influence of these environmental
cues on smoking motivation. This creates the potential for adjuvant medication interventions, whereby β-
adrenergic drugs are used in combination with medications targeting nicotine withdrawal to maximize potential
efficacy. A recently completed study in our laboratory supports this idea, demonstrating that acute
administration of propranolol reduces cue-provoked craving, suppresses neural response to smoking stimuli
(e.g. cigarettes, lighters), and alters connectivity between key brain regions shown to mediate effects in pre-
clinical models. This application seeks to expand upon this work by examining the impact of β-adrenergic
drugs on neural and behavioral response to smoking cues in a larger sample using a design that enables
examination of the effects of a β-adrenergic antagonist alone and in combination with an established smoking
cessation medication targeting nicotine withdrawal. Adult cigarette smokers (N = 80) will systematically
photograph their personal smoking contexts using procedures we have developed and validated. They will
then undergo four functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans during which they will be exposed to
smoking stimuli, including images of their personal smoking contexts. Prior to each scan, they will receive
either: 1) Nicotine Patch + β-Adrenergic Antagonist; 2) Placebo Patch + β-Adrenergic Antagonist; 3) Nicotine
Patch + Placebo Drug; and 4) Placebo Patch + Placebo Drug. Analyses will examine the effects of these
medications on craving and neural activation in response to smoking cues (Aim 1), as well as neural
connectivity (Aim 2). In addition, an exploratory aim will examine whether observed effects are mediated by
changes in cerebrovascular perfusion or neural connectivity at rest (Exploratory Aim 3). Results from this
translational project will provide valuable information on the neural underpinnings of β-adrenergic medications.
It will directly inform the development of a new line of pharmacological agents for smoking cessation and
provide a deeper understanding of mechanisms that can be used to help refine future intervention protocols."

The importance of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to our daily lives has been heightened
by the nature of the pandemic: from vaccines to computer programs that allow us to stay connected, the
innovations that are integral to our daily lives are based in STEM. Further, as healthcare researchers, we
recognize that the brain underpins the nature of the human experience and is involved with a wide variety of
healthcare topics beyond the brain/spinal cord, including but not limited to oncology, trauma, sleep, hearing and
speech, neurodevelopmental disabilities and community health/safety. Understanding how the nervous system
interrelates with various STEM concepts, impacts neurodevelopment, and influences health equity is critical for
building a capable workforce.
The lack of career pathways for diverse and capable young innovators in brain-based STEM and health
backgrounds signals a continued need for a focus on STEM literacy and competencies throughout K-12
education. Mentored Experiences to Expand Opportunities in Research version 3 (“METEOR v. 3”) will
provide meaningful experiences for Washington, DC metro area high school students from diverse cultural,
ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds and STEM teachers-in-training with a specific focus on understanding
the healthy and diseased brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves through a children’s health lens.
METEOR v. 3 will engage participants in inquiry-based biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research in the setting
of Children’s National Hospital and its’ Research Institute. We will provide a comprehensive program and
curriculum, which will employ unique, research-based educational practices designed to stimulate interest and
advance knowledge in the neurosciences, neurobiology, behavioral health and related fields. These innovative
hands-on experiences will stimulate the next generation of students and teachers to bring neurosciences to the
forefront of STEM and health care research."
10814393,"ABSTRACT
The prenatal brain is uniquely susceptible to viral infections. Such infections threaten 1 in 4 pregnancies and can
cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders if not fetal demise. Different viruses lead to strikingly similar clinical
outcomes due to overlapping viral neuropathology and the host’s common neuronal response. Such a reality
calls for the development of urgently needed prenatal standards of care for prevention or treatment of virally
induced brain injury. This need requires a much-deeper understanding of the corresponding neurobiology.
A key regulator of the host’s common neuroviral response is the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) through
essential roles in viral autophagy, which affect viral clearance and neuronal survival. There is unsettled
controversy, however, about whether mTOR expression and viral autophagy are key defenses against, or
requisites to, viral replication and neuronal injury. The PI has new preliminary data connecting mTOR with a
novel neuroviral response gene, Hexosaminidase B (HEXB), and suggesting new cellular functions for this
genetic complex in activating prenatal viral autophagy to prevent brain injury. Opening new research windows
for therapeutic intervention, this sets the context for the proposed K08 study, which rigorously tests the guiding
hypothesis that neurodevelopmental gene expression affects prenatal viral susceptibility toward brain injury.
Purusing three integrated and synergistic aims in cellular, mouse, and human systems, the PI will investige how
gene expression of mTOR and HEXB affects prenatal viral susceptibility and how it might be altered to prevent
brain injury. First, human-derived organoids are used to study how expression of mTOR and HEXB affects viral
clearance, neuronal survival, and up/downstream pathways (Aim 1). In parallel, this relationship is prenatally
evaluated in vivo to determine its impact on postnatal development (Aim 2). Mirrored allelic series of mTOR and
HEXB are genetically cross-titrated in these aims, which will shed light on a population genomic analysis to study
the extent to which variants in these genes/pathways affect prenatal susceptibility to brain injury (Aim 3).
This K08 grant combines research using synergistic/integrated systems with theoretical and technical training
by seasoned mentors in neurobiology, neurovirology, and genomics at Children’s National Hospital and NINDS.
The individually tailored career development plan uniquely positions the PI, a board-certified prenatal-neonatal
critical care neurologist-scientist, to open multiple new research windows into the developing human brain by:
(a) deepening our fundamental understanding of prenatal neurovirology and the crticial role of neuro-
developmental genes (mTOR & HEXB), regulatory networks, and essential cellular functions; (b) examining
genetic regulation of prenatal viral autophagy as a cornerstone for prenatal precision medicine; and (c) tapping
into a robust neuroepidemiology research infrastructure (Consortium, CDC, NIH) to identify prenatal
susceptibilities. The ultimate goal is to understand the connection between viral neurobiology and neuronal injury
in the developing brain to optimize the neuropsychological life experience of future generations of children."

Severe hemorrhage from extremity injuries is a significant cause of battlefield deaths and preventable trauma
fatalities in civilian medicine. Tourniquet use is the most effective means of arresting life-threatening limb
hemorrhage in the pre-hospital setting and creating bloodless surgical fields in orthopedic and vascular
surgeries; however, tourniquet-related ischemia and subsequent reperfusion (IR) can cause serious IR injuries.
These IR injuries have led to the limitations of tourniquet use. Exploring the mechanisms and finding effective
therapies can resolve the limitations of tourniquet use and improve outcomes and quality of life in post-
traumatic patients. The neuromuscular junction is structured to transmit electrical signals from motor nerve
terminals to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) for affecting muscle function. Our pilot data
demonstrated that some nAChR clusters are fragmented in mice with 6 weeks of tourniquet-induced IR.
Therefore, in Aim 1, we will determine the relationship between the fragmentation of nAChR clusters and
muscle contractile dysfunction in long-term tourniquet-induced IR. Additionally, our preliminary studies have
targeted a specific signaling pathway that links fragmentation of nAChR clusters in the injured muscle, namely
the inflammatory cytokine-cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5-catenin-rapsyn signaling pathway. In Aim 2, we will
test if the inflammatory cytokine-Cdk5-catenin-rapsyn signaling pathway mediates fragmentation of nAChR
clusters in long-term tourniquet-induced IR. In Aim 3, we will investigate the therapeutic effect of a novel anti-
inflammatory drug on long-term functional and structural recovery of the neuromuscular junction via inhibition
of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse models of tourniquet/IR injury. We will design in vitro and in vivo
studies to address our overarching hypothesis that anti-inflammation will promote repair of the neuromuscular
junction. Overall, proposed studies will unveil cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for long-term
neuromuscular junction disorder in tourniquet-induced IR. These studies will provide further information that
the neuromuscular junction could be a potential therapeutic target in tourniquet/IR injuries, especially through
the application of a novel anti-inflammatory drug in this proposal. This approach has significant potential to
resolve the limitations of clinical tourniquet use, thereby improving outcomes and quality of life in post-
traumatic patients."
10814395,"A. Specific Aims
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a progressive autoimmune disease which renders individuals incapable of regulating their blood glucose levels due to immune-mediated β cell destruction, resulting in loss of insulin production and many severe health complications that, if untreated, lead to death. Careful monitoring of blood glucose coupled with insulin injections have made T1D a chronic disease in which T1D individuals live ~ a decade less than their healthy counterparts. Thus, a cure for T1D is highly desirable. Cell gene therapy has proven to be an effective way to treat recalcitrant diseases such as pediatric leukemia, where chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) expressing T cells achieve 90% complete response, putting many individuals into very long remissions1, but to date no engineered T cell therapies have been attempted to cure T1D in humans.
We propose to test the hypothesis that engineered T cells can enable islet transplant with minimal or no additional immunosuppression. Islet transplantation represents the best-case scenario to test the ability of engineered T cells to protect islet cells from immune attack and will likely lay the foundation by which strategies are developed to treat new onset T1D. In islet transplant, MHC matching of donor and recipient rarely occurs, generating highly expressed, unique islet-specific HLA antigens that can be targeted by CAR engineered T regulatory cells (CAR Tregs) or T cells engineered to express molecules that suppress the immune system (T suppressor cells or Tsups). Additionally, through a comprehensive screening process, we have identified two targets, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and dipeptidyl peptidase like 6 (DPP6), that are highly expressed on α and β cells and have limited expression elsewhere that could be used to treat recently diagnosed individuals, and all transplant recipients without the desired MHC mismatch. In this proposal, we will further develop this toolbox to both develop better in vivo, preclinical models of T1D and new cell and gene therapies that will prevent, stall or reverse T1D.
Within the last decade, rapid progress made in T cell-based therapies makes it possible to consider such therapies for T1D. Following long-term remission of 3 cancer patients treated by CD19-specific CARs developed by the Center for Cellular Immunotherapies at Penn under the leadership of Carl June2, the CAR T cell revolution was launched. This early success drove considerable investment, empowering many institutions and companies to develop ways to improve both the safety and efficacy of, and reduce cost to produce engineered T cells. Many of these innovations will also help enable cell and gene therapies for T1D, which is the overarching goal of this RFA. The ultimate goal of this application is to successfully treat three non- human primates (NHP) with engineered T cells after an islet transplant, which we predict will launch similar enthusiasm for T1D cell and gene therapy as the first three CD19-CAR recipients did for cancer CAR therapy.
To achieve this goal, an experienced team of investigators with complementary expertise will lead this proposal. This team, a transplant surgeon who helped pioneer islet transplantation as a T1D therapy (Naji), a veterinary physician with expertise developing NHP T regulatory cell therapy models (Duran-Struuck), and a cell and gene therapist with a track record of engineering T cells and developing first-in-human clinical trials (Riley), have been working closely together via Helmsley Foundation funding to obtain the preliminary data presented in this application. This team is now is poised to immediately perform in vivo studies to test the ability of engineered T cell therapies to prevent, stall, or reverse T1D.
Aim 1. Engineer T Suppressor Cells (Tsups) to Facilitate Islet Transplant in Humanized Mouse Models. While T regulatory cells are potent immune suppressors, there are other promising ways to induce tolerance that may work as stand-alone therapies or synergize with CAR Tregs to protect β cell function. We will explore using PD-L1, TGF-β1, and/or γ-aminobutiric acid (GABA) expressing cells targeted to the islet to mediate islet acceptance alone or in combination with CAR Treg approaches we developed using humanized mice.
Aim 2. Optimize T cell Approaches to Promote Islet Transplant in NHPs. To date our efforts have focused on developing NHP CAR Tregs to enable islet transplant. We have optimized isolation, transduction, and expansion of NHP MHC-specific CAR T regulatory cells and are poised to start islet transplant experiments immediately. After we perform proof of principle experiments using CAR Tregs, we will prioritize future experiments based on the data obtained in Aim 1. A particularly exciting aspect of our studies is testing whether the ortho-IL-2 system developed by the Garcia Lab3 can work in non-human primates and support engineered Treg or other engineered T cell function and expansion while having no effect on endogenous effector cells. If successful, these studies will form the basis and rationale for Phase I clinical trials in humans."
10814587,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Overall)
A lag between biomedical research discoveries and the implementation of findings in clinical care is widely
recognized and primarily attributed to a disconnect between researchers and practitioners. One study found
that over the course of 17 years, only 14% of clinical research findings led to direct patient benefit. A reason
research findings are often do not implemented in clinical practice is because health services research takes
place over extended timeframes and researchers place an emphasis on publishing their findings in scientific
journals with less attention to application. Moreover, most researchers are typically external to healthcare
systems, conducting their research in universities or research firms. Closing the gap in translating research
findings to clinical care requires a new way of conducting research by embedding researchers in health care
systems, allowing them to engage in rapid, iterative learning in which evidence informs practice, and practice
informs evidence. The vision of the proposed Learning Health System Embedded Scientist Training and
Research (LHS E-STaR) of the North (LEaRN) Center is to leverage and extend existing infrastructure and
partnerships established at the University of Minnesota (UMN) under the Minnesota Learning Health System
K12 Mentored Career Development Program (MN-LHS) and its Center for Learning Health System Sciences
(MN-CLHSS). The LEaRN Center will accelerate the professional development and patient-centered outcomes
and comparative effectiveness research (PCOR/CER) conducted by specially trained, embedded LHS
researchers in the Minnesota health care system and beyond. The LEaRN Center represents a partnership
between UMN and five hub partner sites with established traditions of academic excellence and collaboration
between clinicians and embedded scientists with demonstrated success achieving the long-term goal to
expand and diversify the LHS-research trained workforce. Led by MPIs Timothy Beebe and Genevieve
Melton-Meaux, the LEaRN Center will leverage the unique strengths of five hub partners to provide diverse
didactic and experiential research and training opportunities to LHS scientists to equip them with the LHS tools
and expertise to make meaningful differences in health care settings serving children, the elderly,
under-represented and rural populations, Veterans, and individuals with multiple disorders. The LEaRN Center
will address five Aims: leverage and expand existing LHS infrastructure and partnerships to identify and
nurture a new generation of embedded LHS scholars (Aim 1); enhance the diversity of LHS scientists, their
science and their mentors (Aim 2); create a novel LHS infrastructure that supports the conduct, dissemination,
implementation, and use of PCOR/CER in healthcare system (Aim 3); create learning communities and
networks to convene, deliberate, and share knowledge (Aim 4); and implement a rigorous system for program
evaluation and improvement (Aim 5). The LEaRN Center will cultivate the next generation of LHS scientists
with the expertise, field experience, and community and professional partnerships to close the gap between
researchers and clinicals and assume LHS leadership roles."
10875722,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Understanding the relationship between risk factors and early symptoms is crucial to early and differential
diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Expression of the -4 allele of human apolipoprotein E (APOE-4) gene,
the strongest genetic risk factor for development of the episodic late-onset AD, associates tightly with the
earliest AD symptom - olfactory deficit (OD) in humans. Animals expressing the human APOE-4 gene evince
OD symptoms before AD pathogenesis, indicating a role of APOE-4 in functional disorders of the olfactory
system. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the APOE-4 effects on olfaction remain
unclear. We hypothesize that APOE-4 dysregulates neural circuits leading to excitation-inhibition imbalance
and neural hyperactivity in the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) to cause OD at the early stage of AD based
on the following evidence. First, the hallmark AD pathologies appear in the AON in the Braak stages 0 and I
of the disease and increase with AD severity. APOE-4 elevates AD pathogenesis. Second, the severity of AD
pathology (especially tau hyperphosphorylation) in the AON correlates linearly with the copies of APOE-4
allele. Third, AON has direct interconnections with the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, hippocampus, amygdala,
and lateral entorhinal cortex. All these olfactory centers exhibit vulnerability to AD pathogenesis at early
stages in humans and neuronal hyperexcitability in transgenic animals with humanized APOE-4 genotype.
Based on our preliminary data and the massive interconnections of AON with all other olfactory brain centers
via glutamatergic transmission that is particularly susceptible to detrimental effects of APOE-4, we
hypothesize that APOE-4 causes excitation-inhibition imbalance in the AON and dysfunction of related neural
circuits leading to OD. Three specific aims are proposed to test our central hypothesis. Aim 1: Determine
APOE-4 impact on olfaction-dependent behaviors. Aim 2: Investigate APOE-4 effects on AON neuronal
excitability. Aim 3: Characterize APOE-4 influence on synaptic processing in the AON. The proposed work is
designed to fill gaps in our knowledge on the mechanistic relationship between APOE-4, a well-established
genetic risk factor of LOAD, and OD at the cellular, circuit, and behavioral levels. Our findings will potentially
shed light on development of effective strategies for early and accurate diagnosis of AD in the APOE-4-
carrying or even broader populations. Since AD progressively impairs patient’s cognitive and other mental
abilities for years to decades thus significantly compromises the quality of life in the senior populations in the
US and worldwide, early and accurate diagnosis of this neurodegeneration will significantly benefit the
affected populations and their societies at the medical, economical, emotional, and social levels."
10812811,"Many species depend on social activity to thrive, and social impairment is a fundamental symptom of several
mental diseases. According to research, synaptic signals and activity can control social behavior. Yet, it is still
unclear how synapse control and social behavior are related. δ-catenin functions as an anchor for the
glutamatergic AMPA receptor (AMPARs) to regulate synaptic activity in excitatory synapses. Several families
with autism have been identified to have mutations in the δ-catenin gene, which results in a loss of δ-catenin
functions at excitatory synapses and is thought to be the etiology of autism in people. Recent studies, including
our own, suggest that the loss of δ-catenin functions significantly decreases cortical neurons' inhibition to
increase excitation. Our new data further reveal that δ-catenin deficiency disrupts social behavior in mice. These
new findings strongly support the scientific premise that δ-catenin is critical for glutamatergic synaptic activity
and social behavior. Nonetheless, the δ-catenin-mediated link of synaptic, cellular, and neural substrates to
social behavior is understudied. The significance of the current proposal is thus predicated on filling this gap.
Postsynaptic glutamatergic activity in excitatory and inhibitory cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
regulates cellular excitation and inhibition to control prefrontal rhythmic activity patterns, which is essential in the
control of social behavior in humans and animals. However prior research on the neural basis of social behavior
has mostly concentrated on top-down mPFC projections to various subcortical regions. Hence, in these earlier
studies, glutamatergic inputs to prefrontal neurons were mainly disregarded. Therefore, it is unclear how the
postsynaptic glutamatergic activity of prefrontal cells relates to social behavior. Research suggests that
parvalbumin-positive (PV+) inhibitory interneurons in the mPFC receive direct glutamatergic inputs from multiple
subcortical regions to provide feedforward inhibition onto prefrontal pyramidal neurons and control network
activity. This is important for the regulation of social behavior. Our preliminary data suggest that δ-catenin
deficiency impairs prefrontal neural activity at cellular and network levels to induce social deficits. Therefore,
existing data and our new findings lead us to hypothesize that δ-catenin is important for glutamatergic activity
in PV+ inhibitory interneurons to provide feedforward inhibition onto pyramidal neurons in the mPFC, which
regulates prefrontal activity at the cellular and network levels to ensure normal social behavior. We will employ
two new mouse models of δ-catenin deficiency - δ-catenin KO mice and human ASD-associated δ-catenin
glycine 34 to serine (G34S) mutant mice – to examine if δ-catenin controls pathway-specific glutamatergic activity
in PV+ interneurons and feedforward inhibition onto pyramidal neurons in the mPFC (Aim 1), to determine
whether δ-catenin deficiency disrupts prefrontal network activity during social interaction (Aim 2), and to address
if altering prefrontal δ-catenin expression is sufficient to affect social behavior (Aim 3)."

10820425,"Breast cancer (BCa) is the leading cause of women cancer mortality worldwide, and triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC) cells accounts for 15-20% BCa. However, higher therapeutic resistance and lower survival
of TNBC patients remain the major hinder of BCa treatment. Doxorubicin (Dox) and radiation are commonly
used for TNBC treatment. In our preliminary study, we found that TNBC showed much lower expression
levels of miR-152. Higher expression levels of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) and DNA hypermethylation were
involved in miR-152 suppression in TNBC cells. To understand mechanism of miR-152 suppression, and
role and mechanism of miR-152 in regulating cancer development and Dox- and radiation-induced
resistance, we performed a lot of preliminary experiments to identify what molecules that were potential
miR-152 direct targets as well as that were upregulated in Dox-resistant TNBC or PDX tumor tissues. We
found that pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (PKM2), solute Carrier Family 7 Member 5 (SLC7A5), and
polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) as direct targets of miR-152 with potential ability to converse
Dox-mediated resistance. PKM2, SLC7A5 and PTBP1 levels were increased when miR-152 expression
was suppressed in TNBC cells and PDX model. We found that miR-152 suppression played an important
role in mediating TNBC metabolic reprogramming, Warburg effect switch, tumor growth and Dox resistance
through PKM2/SLC7A5/PTBP1. We showed that overexpression of miR-152 or PKM2 knockdown rendered
TNBC cells more sensitive to radiation treatment. These new findings create new opportunity to investigate
mechanism of TNBC therapeutic resistance. We hypothesize that resistance to chemotherapy and
radiation treatment, metabolic reprogramming, and TNBC development are induced by miR-152
suppression and upregulation of PKM2, SLC7A5, and PTBP1. To test this central hypothesis, we will
perform experiments through three aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate role and mechanism of miR-152
suppression in TNBC cells in doxorubicin- and radiation-induced resistance; and role and mechanism of
PKM2 switch and induction via alternative splicing by miR-152 suppression to induce Warburg effect,
therapeutic resistance, and tumor growth. In Aim 2, we will determine role and mechanism of miR-
152/SLC7A5/PTBP1 pathway in regulating metabolic reprogramming and Warburg effect switch, and in
mediating doxorubicin- and radiation-induced therapeutic resistance. In Aim 3, we will determine whether
miR-152 suppression and PKM2 induction regulate tumor angiogenesis through CXCL8 expression using a
humanized chimeric tumor model; and whether levels of miR-152, PKM2, HIF-1α, hnRNPA3, SLC7A5, and
PTBP1 are correlated each other, and are correlated with therapeutic responses and with the cancer stages
and survival. This R01 project will identify mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, and metabolic
reprogramming; and provide information for developing new treatment option of TNBC in the future."
10820553,"While discussions about aging societies center mostly around concerns, the growing elderly population
also represents a source of social and human capital that has only recently become available and is
currently underutilized. There has been relatively little consideration of the positive contributions older
people can make to societies and even less exploration of ways to establish new norms and generate new
social roles that benefit older people and the broader societies in which they live. The proposed research
aims to characterize contributions that older people make to families and neighborhoods and explore ways
to increase such contributions. The overarching objective is to identify and illuminate conditions that foster
win-win outcomes in which older people contribute to the well-being of others in ways that simultaneously
confer benefits to their own health and well-being.
The research is guided conceptually by socioemotional selectivity theory, which maintains that changing
time horizons result in systematic age differences in motivation and emotion such that aging is associated
with increasingly greater priority placed on emotionally meaningful experiences. In addition to continued
efforts to refine measures and replicate findings throughout the five-year grant period, three specific aims
will be pursued. The first tests the hypothesis that grandparents confer protective effects on grandchildren
which are predicted by emotional characteristics and investment of grandparents. We also hypothesize that
these effects are most pronounced when grandchildren live in high-risk households. The second aim
considers the potential cognitive costs of structuring social worlds around well-known and emotionally close
others and strives to characterize social environments that offer both cognitive stimulation and emotional
satisfaction. The third aim explores the effects of older community residents on neighborhood well-being.
We hypothesize that a higher density of older people in a neighborhood is associated with lower school
absenteeism in children and lower crime rates as well as greater social cohesion. With social network
analysis we will examine the influence of highly engaged older neighbors on the strength of social cohesion
at the community level.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Aging presents significant challenges for individuals and societies in the 21st century. Most of the
anticipated burden, however, is predicated on social and cultural norms that fail to encourage active

West Africa holds a significant burden of the HIV epidemic with approximately 3.5 million people living with HIV
(PLHIV). Despite calls for action to support access to universal test and treat in the region, West Africa
experience major challenges ensuring a continuum of HIV care in adequacy with the latest UNAIDS
recommendations. To address these core challenges, the IeDEA West Africa Collaboration relies on a unique
network of cohorts in West Africa with a mission to conduct hypothesis-driven epidemiological research on
barriers in access to care as well as on the prognosis and outcomes of PLHIV, including adults, adolescents and
children in care, as well as HIV-exposed children. Our five-year research plan will focus on scientific questions
that contributing cohorts can hardly answer separately with a unique partnership between English-speaking and
French-speaking countries in the region. The overarching specific aims of our program will be: 1) To identify an
describe individual and structural barriers associated with the continuum of HIV care, from HIV testing to retention
in care and viral suppression throughout West Africa, 2) To leverage our existing network to establish a cohort
of HIV Key Populations including female sex workers and men who have sex with men in IeDEA West Africa, 3)
To determine the burden of non-communicable diseases and evaluate their interplay with HIV infection. Our
collaboration has supported one of the most robust epidemiological and clinical research infrastructure in the
region, housing data on close to 40,000 adults (including 883 HIV-2 et 843 HIV-1/2) and 15,814 children (6,515
children exposed to HIV, 7,041 on ART and 2,258 children living with HIV not already on ART) in seven countries
in the region (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Togo and Senegal). The next round will involve
21 HIV clinical centers in eight countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and
Togo). Among them, eight clinics are new collaborating centers. The IeDEA West Africa collaboration is
coordinated at the University of Bordeaux, France with a regional Office hosted by the PACCI program, a
research-oriented non-governmental organization situated in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire. This research team has a
long-lasting experience in observational HIV research including large-scale prospective cohorts in West Africa.
Data will be collected from affiliated cohorts every year according to standardized procedures and will be merged
at the coordinating center in Bordeaux. Capacity building in participating centers will include funding for local
human resources, training on data quality, on-site technical support and annual meetings to reinforce the
technical and scientific network. At the completion of this funding cycle, we intend to address major research
gaps including a better knowledge the various comorbidities affecting PLHIV in West Africa. Our cohorts will be
more representative of the regional HIV epidemic and will capture important data on Key Populations to inform
target interventions for these vulnerable groups."
10820439,"Proper growth, septation, and maturation of the cardiac outflow tract (OFT) into valved aortic and pulmonary
outlets are essential for oxygenated circulation after birth. 1-2% of live births and up to 30% of pre-term fetal
deaths have congenital heart defects, many of which affect the remodeling of the valvuloseptal primordial tissues,
called the proximal and distal outflow cushions. Despite much effort uncovering the genetic basis of early OFT
cushion formation, this understanding has not explained the clinically relevant phases of growth, condensation
and elongation into valves and septa. One reason for this appears to be the domination of conditional and
collective signaling mechanisms that are well accessible by genetic approaches. Mechanical forces (shear
stress, pressure, tension) are ever present during this complex period of OFT growth and remodeling, but to date
no studies have investigated these key interactions, especially for their contributions to OFT defects. We believe
that clinically relevant OFT remodeling arise from improper cushion endocardial and/or mesenchymal sensation
of and/or response to their local mechanical environment, which in turn drives the incorrect signaling programs.
The Butcher lab has pioneered innovative technology 1) to quantify local in vivo mechanical forces within this
OFT region and register them with local in situ gene/protein expression, 2) to not-invasively visualize and
precisely ablate intracardiac tissues without collateral damage in vivo, and 3) to directly test mechanobiological
mechanisms of endocardial cushion growth and remodeling ex vivo. The preliminary data in this proposal present
evidence of two mechanoregulated molecular switches that potentiate between OFT cushion proliferation and
differentiation, which motivates the novel hypothesis that local mechanosensaton operates molecular switches
to control sizing, shape, and stratification of the outflow valves and septa. Aim 1 will implement innovative non-
invasive laser photoablations of the formed proximal or distal cushions of the avian OFT to create genetically
unbiased clinically relevant outflow tract malformations. We will then quantitatively analyze and register their
hemodynamic, morphological and phenotypic changes. We will further apply novel deconvolution integration of
sc-Seq and slide-seq to reveal unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution of the cellular course of malformation,
and elaborate how known and newly discovered molecular regulatory programs associate with local mechanical
stress changes. Aim 2 will test the mechanistic causailty of the mechanotransduction operated molecular
switches in the OFT cushion endocardium via shear stress patterns. Aim 3 will test the operation of different
mechanobiogical switches in cushion mesenchyme via tension/compression. using high throughput ex vivo
organ cultures. The findings from these studies will substantally advance our understanding of
mechanoregulation and conditional signaling in outflow tract valuvloseptal maturation, paving the way for
strategies to manipulate such signaling programs to reduce or even rescue CHD severity in utero."

Mitochondrial diseases are heterogeneous genetic disorders caused by the impairment of the
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, affecting tissues that are heavily energy
dependent, and often manifesting with neuromuscular symptoms accompanied by a variety of
additional clinical features. Although the energetic defects arising from genetic errors in
mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are often known, many aspects of mitochondrial disease
pathogenesis are yet to be elucidated. As a consequence, because of the lack of defined
metabolic targets, no proven effective treatments or cures are available. Our recently published
studies indicate that a dramatic metabolic remodeling occurs in the skeletal muscle of a mouse
model of mitochondrial myopathy. We found that a starvation-like response promotes muscle
protein breakdown and amino acid catabolism to support a compensatory energy-generating
oxidative flux. In this flux, glutamate is oxidized through the TCA cycle and allows for OXPHOS-
independent substrate-level ADP phosphorylation. However, this compensatory process results
in muscle wasting and lipids accumulation. We hypothesize that in addition to ATP synthesis
impairment, OXPHOS-defective tissues must face a number of dysmetabolic problems caused
by altered pathways of the intermediary metabolism. Importantly, in preliminary studies leading
to this application, we have discovered that skeletal muscle from human patients with
mitochondrial myopathy show similar compensatory metabolic responses. Our findings suggest
that this metabolic shift towards preferred utilization of amino acids over lipids for energetic
purposes underlies maladaptive effects, contributing to disease pathogenesis.
In aim 1 of this application, we will investigate in depth the mechanisms and roles of the
metabolic rewiring in OXPHOS-defective muscle of a mouse model of mitochondrial myopathy.
In aim 2 we will investigate the muscle metabolic remodeling in human mitochondrial myopathy.
In aim 3 we will test metabolic supplementation therapy in the mitochondrial myopathy mouse.
At the conclusion of this study we will have improved our knowledge on the pathogenic
mechanisms of mitochondrial diseases, established a functional biomarker panel for human
mitochondrial myopathy, and assessed if metabolic supplementation can improve the myopathic
phenotype."
10817755,"Summary
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is potentially curative for many blood disorders
but is often complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Despite major advances in therapeutic strategies,
GvHD-related morbidity and mortality remain high, and better tools to predict the GvHD risk are urgently needed.
The immunologic basis of GvHD is the recognition by donor T cells of minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAgs),
arising from nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences between donor and recipient.
However, only some 50 mHAgs have been reported thus far. Current advances in the characterization of
germline and somatic events within coding exomes through next-generation sequencing, coupled with
improvements in HLA class I and II epitope prediction, offer an unprecedented opportunity to systematically
identify candidate mHAgs on an individualized basis. We hypothesize that identification of tissue-specific mHAgs,
predicted through baseline analysis of patient and donor DNA, can enable a personalized genomics-informed
risk assessment of GvHD, with the potential to help refine current donor selection algorithms and to enable
personalized tailoring of post-transplant immunosuppression. Our aims are thus to: (1) Build an epitope
prediction pipeline to systematically identify mHAgs, incorporating state-of-the-art tools for SNP discovery
from WES, expression filters designed through comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and proteomic
profiling of a set of commonly targeted GvHD tissues (i.e. skin, liver, colon and lung), inflammation signatures,
and Y-chromosome specific expression (in the case of female male transplants). This will be then coupled with
HLA class I and II prediction. Epitope predictions will be confirmed through direct detection of HLA-bound
peptides by immunopeptidome-based evaluations of GvHD-affected target tissues. (2) Define and track the T
cell responses to predicted mHAgs in patients with GvHD. To link prediction of mHAg targets with functional
T cell responses, we will establish proof-of-concept by testing for mHAg-specific T cell responses across three
clinically relevant settings: (i) patients experiencing organ-specific GvHD, immunoproteomically characterized in
Aim 1; (ii) patients who received sequential allo-HSCT from 2 distinct HLA-identical donors and experienced
GvHD following one but not the other transplant; and (iii) patients who received post-transplant
cyclophosphamide after matched related donor (MRD) HSCT as part of GvHD prophylaxis. (3) Test the
feasibility of mHAg prediction to generate a prognostic GvHD risk score. To determine if individual mHAg
burden relates to clinically observed GvHD, we will focus on patients with myeloid neoplasia, and perform WES
analysis on a discovery set of DNA from ~200 MRD recipient-donor pairs from patients treated at DFCI, and then
on an extension set of ~200 pairs from URD HSCT, from whom information regarding GvHD occurrence is
available. Through a planned validation analysis of ~600 other pairs (also myeloid neoplasia) from CIBMTR, we
will assess if this approach is applicable cross-institutionally, and for patients across ethnicities."

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of
proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However,
as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower
sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match
observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully
interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable
insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to
design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical,
and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which
new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR
signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes
key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will
design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively
introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and
2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the
NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from
machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible
to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important
proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated
proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but
cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the
protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for
meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from
expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This
will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have
assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive dementia (memory and cognitive
loss) in older adults. Presently, more than 5.5 million Americans may have dementia caused by AD. There is
no cure for this debilitating condition. It is increasingly critical that we develop better early diagnostic tools and
new treatment strategies for this neurodegenerative disease. Previous gene expression studies using brain
tissue and cross-sectional design identify genes whose expression correlates with AD progression. Gene
expression is regulated by the cell’s epigenome comprising of DNA methylation, histone modification and non-
coding RNAs. We propose to characterize the epigenome of key cell types in neural circuits responsible for
learning and memory. Our goal is to determine how the epigenome shapes hippocampal circuit activity and
behaviors during AD progression, using the latest single cell genomic technologies coupled with functional circuit
mapping and behavioral analysis. We will use two AD mouse models that recapitulate neuropathological
features and functional defects observed in human Alzheimer’s. Our guiding hypothesis is that AD
neurodegeneration causes significant alterations in the epigenome of cells, including maladaptive changes in
accessible chromatin landscape and gene expression programs in disease relevant cell types. This in turn
causes defects in specific neural circuit functionality during AD pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will generate a
comprehensive epigenome- and transcription-based cell atlas for hippocampal CA1 and subiculum, and identify
epigenomic changes that accompany AD progression in each cell type in AD model mice and age-matched
control mice. Single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq), single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and the newly
developed Methyl-HI in single cells for joint mapping of DNA methylation and chromatin contacts will be key
approaches. The proposed work will allow for creation of the first single cell multi-omics atlas of the hippocampal
circuits, and will allow us to track the epigenomic changes exhibited by multiple specific cell populations at
different AD-like neurodegeneration stages. In Aims 2 and 3, we will investigate the cell subtype specific
epigenomic and gene expression basis of neural circuit activities and related memory behaviors in AD model
mice of middle age. We will measure epigenomic and behavioral changes in response to genetically targeted
ontogenetic hippocampal circuit manipulation and histone deacetylase inhibition. Further, we will determine the
beneficial effects of simple behavioral interventions via physical exercise on AD-related epigenomic signatures
in Aim 3. Together, our proposed research will provide a new framework to study the molecular underpinnings
of neural circuit activities affected during the course of AD pathogenesis. It will also lead to the identification of
new therapeutic targets and molecular biomarkers for early detection and better treatment of AD."

10804808,"Project Summary/Abstract
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition with deleterious effects on individuals and
society. Evidence-based treatments for PTSD are available, including cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and
prolonged exposure (PE), but response rates are suboptimal, and dropout rates are high. Patients report
concerns about treatment that prevent optimal response, but evidence suggests therapists are often unaware of
patients' concerns and do not intervene effectively to help their patients benefit from treatment. The purpose of
this research is to refine and test an Adjunctive Writing intervention for Amplifying Response and Engagement
(AWARE), which was developed to enhance outcomes in CPT and PE. AWARE integrates findings from the field
of health communication and uses a writing task and guided therapist responses to facilitate improved patient-
therapist communication about patients’ treatment-related concerns during existing check-ins in CPT and PE.
After iteratively refining AWARE through a case series (n=4), a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=50) will be
conducted to preliminarily compare CPT/PE with AWARE to CPT/PE treatment as usual (TAU). The primary aim
of the RCT is to take an experimental therapeutics approach to demonstrate that AWARE is feasible, acceptable,
and engages the target of improved patient-therapist communication relative to TAU. A preliminary examination
will also be conducted of the effects of 1) AWARE vs. TAU, and 2) variability in patient-therapist communication
on symptom improvement and treatment completion. An exploratory aim is to examine patient-therapist
communication as a mechanism of improved symptom reduction and attendance in AWARE using session-by-
session assessments to see if the putative mechanism precedes and predicts the outcomes. This trial is
consistent with NIMH's Strategy 3.1.A, ""Developing novel interventions using a mechanism-informed,
experimental therapeutics approach,"" and can both enhance outcomes for patients with PTSD and improve the
field's knowledge of processes for enhancing PTSD treatments. Further, given that AWARE is a brief intervention
that can be implemented during existing check-ins in evidence-based treatments, AWARE can be easily scaled
and implemented to enhance outcomes across mental health disorders. The proposed research and training
plans will allow the applicant to gain essential knowledge and applied experience in 1) refining and evaluating a
mechanism-based intervention to enhance PTSD treatments, 2) translating health communication knowledge to
improve PTSD treatment outcomes, 3) using advanced data analyses to examine mechanisms of therapeutic
change, 4) conducting clinical trials in an experimental therapeutics framework, and 5) professional development
and grantsmanship. It will facilitate the applicant's transition to an independent investigator who uses treatment
mechanistic knowledge to optimize PTSD treatment outcomes. This project will take place at the National Center
for PTSD at VA Boston Healthcare System with support from accomplished mentors committed to the applicant's
professional development: Drs. Tara Galovski (primary mentor), Shannon Kehle-Forbes, and Brian Smith."
10812423,"This grant application aims to identify and characterize the role of Piezo in cells of the muscularis during baseline and stretched states. Bowel motility disorders and acute bouts of bowel obstruction are common clinical problems and can be severe, and we do not fully understand their mechanisms or have effective treatments. One crucial mechanism controlling bowel motility is mechanosensing, allowing each bowel segment to sense and respond to stretch. 
Various cell types within the intestinal muscularis control motility, sense stretch, and induce contractions. Among these cells are the components of the SIP syncytium comprised of smooth muscle cells (SMC), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and PDGFRcells. These cells respond to stretch and receive inputs from enteric neurons (EN), glia, and enteroendocrine cells (EEC) that modulate SIP syncytium activity. However, the mechanism underlying the ability to sense and respond to stretch has not been thoroughly evaluated. Here we propose to investigate the role of Piezo in this process. Piezo is a relatively new calcium channel that functions as a mechanosensor in numerous cells, including those in the gut. Here, we will focus on its role in smooth muscle cells, interstitial cells of Cajal, and PDGFRcells of the small intestine. 
To perform these experiments, we have developed novel methods to maintain murine cells of the muscularis in an in vitro system. We will also use physiologically tunable hydrogels to examine the consequences of stretch in this setting. Finally, we will use various genetic approaches to explore the effects of mechanosensing in SIP cells of the gut. After this study, we anticipate that we will further elucidate the biomechanical and physiological consequences of disrupting a mechanosensitive channel that alters muscularis function and highlight myopathy's indirect effect on the adjacent epithelial layer to exacerbate the dysmotility further."

Clinical gait abnormalities are present in about 35% of community-dwelling
older adults in the US, and accelerated gait decline is associated with many adverse physical and cognitive
outcomes - including falls, disability, cognitive decline, and dementia. Such outcomes not only reduces the quality
of life of affected individuals, their families, and friends, but also leads to increased health care costs. In 2000
the direct costs of falls among older adults exceeded $19 billion, and the cost of health care following an
emergency visit for an injurious fall among older adults totaled 6.8 billion in the US. In 2014, the estimated cost
of formal care to people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias was 214 billion in the US, plus another
220 billion in estimated costs for informal care provided by family members and other unpaid caregivers. Hence,
a better understanding of trajectories, and modifiable risk factors, of brain, gait, and cognitive decline in aging
can have a tremendous impact on individuals as well as to society. We aim to compare and contrast
trajectories of functional and structural brain changes with gait decline and cognitive decline in
cognitively-healthy older adults, and older adults in the early stages of cognitive decline. We hypothesize
that functional and structural changes in the control pathway of human locomotion – including supplementary
motor, insular, and prefrontal cortex regions – precede (or have earlier change points than) gait decline and
cognitive decline (Hypothesis 1a), and that functional brain changes precede structural brain changes
(Hypothesis 1b). We further hypothesize that functional and structural decline in these regions will be steeper or
have earlier change points in older adults with the motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome (Hypothesis 2) – a
pre-dementia syndrome characterized by slow gait and cognitive complaint – as well as in older adults with few
high-contact social relationships and poor social networks (Hypothesis 3). We will cross-enroll 200 LonGenity
study participants with up to 10 years of annual gait and cognitive testing, and 2 planned MRI scans (3 years
apart; 23 baseline MRIs completed). We propose to add a third MRI scan (3 years later) to permit examination
of both linear and non-linear relationships, and to extend annual gait, cognitive and social network testing.
This proposal is innovative because it simultaneously examines trajectories of both functional brain
decline (task-based functional activation/deactivation, resting-state functional connectivity) and structural
brain decline (gray matter volume, cortical thickness, structural connectivity), gait decline, and cognitive
decline in older adults in general – and as they relate to the MCR pre-dementia syndrome, and social
networks in particular. This proposal has the potential to provide a better understanding of the
interrelationships between gait, cognition and brain aging – and inform the development of targeted, and
appropriately sequenced, interventions for maintaining gait and cognition in aging, pre-dementia, early
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias."
11052249,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Clinical gait abnormalities are present in about 35% of community-dwelling
older adults in the US, and accelerated gait decline is associated with many adverse physical and cognitive
outcomes - including falls, disability, cognitive decline, and dementia. Such outcomes not only reduces the quality
of life of affected individuals, their families, and friends, but also leads to increased health care costs. In 2000
the direct costs of falls among older adults exceeded $19 billion, and the cost of health care following an
emergency visit for an injurious fall among older adults totaled 6.8 billion in the US. In 2014, the estimated cost
of formal care to people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias was 214 billion in the US, plus another

Typical mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists (e.g., oxycodone, fentanyl) are efficacious analgesics for the
treatment of moderate to severe pain. However, the therapeutic window of typical MOR agonists for pain
management is limited by their unwanted side effects such as respiratory depression and abuse liability. The
limitations of typical MOR agonists have prompted the development of novel MOR agonists (e.g., PZM-21, SR-
17018) with more favorable safety profiles. However, the mechanism by which these novel agonists produce
their more desirable behavioral effects is still unknown. One body of evidence indicates that the compounds
exhibit improved side-effect profiles due to G-protein signaling bias. However, more recent work has
challenged this position with evidence indicating that these novel agonists are merely partial agonists at the
MOR. Thus, the results from in vitro investigations into mechanisms are conflicting and in vivo studies are
lacking. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate a series of G-protein biased MOR agonists in preclinical
models of therapeutic and side effects, and under experimental conditions designed to differentiate typical from
partial MOR agonists. Under these conditions, typical MOR agonists produce maximal magnitude of effects,
and partial MOR agonists produce sub-maximal magnitude of effects. Specifically, Aim 1 will measure the
magnitude of analgesia produced by novel MOR agonists in comparison to typical and partial MOR agonists
under different levels of thermal nociceptive stimulation in a hot-plate assay. Aim 2 will measure the magnitude
of respiratory depression produced by novel MOR agonists, in comparison to typical and partial MOR agonists
in a whole-body plethysmography assay. Aim 3 will compare the maximum breakpoint (indicator of abuse
liability) mediated by typical, partial, and novel MOR agonists in a self-administration assay under increasing
levels of operant challenge provided by a progressive-ratio schedule of reinforcement. Based on the profile of
behavioral effects engendered by the novel MOR agonists, we will be able to determine which in vitro position
is most closely recapitulated in vivo. Ultimately, our findings from these three aims will inform the development
of opioid-based therapeutics with more favorable safety profiles and wider therapeutic windows. To accomplish
these aims, the training plan was described in this proposal, and, it will be carried out at the Jackson campus
of the University of Mississippi Medical Center. The applicant will be receiving scientific training and
professional development from the sponsor, the sponsor's collaborators, the Program In Neuroscience, and
the School of Graduate Studies in the Health Sciences."

The routine operation of the US Healthcare system produces an abundance of electronically-stored data that
captures the care of patients as it is provided in settings outside of controlled research environments. The
potential for utilizing these data to inform future treatment choices and improve patient care and outcomes of all
patients in the very system that generates the data is widely acknowledged. Given these key properties of the
routine-care data and the abundance of electronic healthcare databases covering millions of patients, it is critical
to strengthen the rigor of analyses of such data. Our group has previously developed an analytic approach to
reduce bias when analyzing routine-care databases, which has proven effective in more than 50 empirical
research studies across a range of topics and data sources. However, this approach currently cannot incorporate
free-text information that is recorded in electronic health records, such as clinical notes and reports. This
limitation has left a large amount of rich patient information underutilized for clinical research. We thus aim to
adapt and refine a set of established computerized natural language processing algorithms that can identify and
extract useful information from the clinical notes and reports in electronic health records and incorporate them
into our validated analytical approach for balancing background risks of different comparison groups, a key step
to ensure fair evaluation when comparing different therapeutic options. To test this newly integrated and
augmented approach, we will implement and adapt it in simulation studies where we can evaluate and improve
the performance of these new analytic methods in a controlled but realistic fashion. In addition, we will assess
the performance of our new approach in 8 practical studies comparing medical or surgical treatments that are
highly relevant to patients. To ensure highest level of data completeness and quality, we have linked multiple
healthcare utilization (claims) databases, spanning from 2007 to 2016, with 3 electronic health records systems,
including one each in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Texas. This data will allow testing of our newly
integrated approach in a variety of care delivery systems and data environments, which will be very informative
for the application of our products in the real-world settings."

Detecting adaptive genetic variation in population genomic datasets is important for understanding the genetic
architecture underlying complex genetic diseases. Humans and other natural populations have been evolving
under complex demographic histories, including divergence of ancestral populations, migration in structured
populations, and past population size changes. Adaptive genetic variation and variation subject to complex
demographic histories can result in similar observable genomic patterns, and distinguishing the evolutionary
forces underlying genetic variation observed in natural population remains challenging. It is thus of importance
to unravel the complex demographic histories underlying natural populations, and develop methods that detect
adaptive genetic variation while properly accounting for these histories. In addition to contemporary genomic
data, researchers have been gathering genetic data from ancient human remains in recent years. Including
such datasets into the analyses has the potential to vastly improve our ability to detect population structure and
genetic variation adapting to selective pressure. Thus, we will develop several tools for the analysis of
contemporary and ancient genomic datasets to unravel the migration histories underlying the population
expansion of humans and to detect adaptive genetic variation while accounting for these histories. To this end,
we will develop a novel Coalescent Hidden Markov Model method to characterize complex migration histories.
Our novel approach will use more efficient representations of local genealogies then previous approaches,
which increases the accuracy of the inference and is more robust to noise in the data. Moreover, this
framework will allow us to analyze population genomic data from large public databases to identify adaptive
genetic variation. The local genealogies will be highly skewed in regions with adaptive genetic variation, as
compared to genomic regions evolving under neutrality. The novel framework can be used to compute the
posterior distribution of genealogical summaries at different locations in the genome to identify regions with
skewed genealogies. In addition, we will implement approaches to detect adaptive genetic variation based on
forward-in-time solutions of the dynamics of beneficial genetic variation and linked neutral regions. Based on a
previously developed numerical approach, we will develop composite likelihood frameworks of observed
genomic sequence variation under this model to detect adaptive genetic variation, while accounting for the
underlying complex demographic history. Moreover, we will develop a method that aims at detecting polygenic
adaptation from ancient DNA. This approach will be based on explicit likelihood models of the underlying allele
frequency dynamics and allow us to detect and quantify directional and, unlike previous approaches, stabilizing
selection on complex traits. Lastly, we will collaborate with colleagues to apply these methods and other
appropriate tools to ancient DNA datasets to unravel the genetic response of medieval European populations
to the Black Death pandemic."
10795912,"SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) need to integrate microenvironmental cues to switch their fate between
quiescence, self-renewal, and differentiation, thereby sustaining hematopoiesis through life. However, the
molecular programs governing HSC stemness become grossly dysregulated during culture, hindering our ability
to expand functional HSCs for treating hematological diseases. Our data uncovered MYCT1 (Myc target 1) as
human HSC regulatory factor that is critical for their expansion and engraftment, but becomes suppressed during
differentiation and culture. We found that MYCT1 localizes in endosomes, interacts with vesicle components and
signaling receptors with critical functions in HSCs (e.g. TGFBR1 and 2), and controls the rate of endocytosis,
which modulates cell signaling and must be tightly regulated to maintain HSC stemness. Many genes
dysregulated upon MYCT1 knockdown (KD) are linked to HSC division and self-renewal. We hypothesize that
MYCT1 governs HSC stemness and their ability to balance between fate options by fine-tuning multiple signaling
cues through the control of endocytosis. We have created a toolbox of MYCT1 knockdown and overexpression
vectors, including various MYCT1 deletion mutants, that can be used in primary human HSPCs as well as HSC-
like and endothelial cell line models to investigate MYCT1 mechanism of action. We will investigate how MYCT1-
mediated control of endocytosis affects signaling in HSCs, and how this influences HSC cell-fate decisions
including quiescence and asymmetric vs symmetric division. We will then assess if rescuing MYCT1 regulated
processes improves the function of cultured human HSC, including those expanded using MLLT3
overexpression. Our work may open up new strategies to maintain HSC transplantability during ex vivo
expansion and ultimately help broaden HSC clinical applications."
10793851,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Clinical significance: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer and
represents 15-20% of new cases (1). Given that TNBC lacks molecular expression of hormonal receptors and
HER2 amplification, chemotherapy remains the go-to treatment option (2). The prognosis for TNBC patients is
grim, and after initial surgery/chemotherapy, patients often relapse with metastases to lung, brain, liver, and
bone (3). Understanding the mechanisms that govern TNBC progression and metastasis can reveal new targets
for therapeutic intervention which is an urgent and unmet clinical need for this patient population (4,5).
Rationale: Autophagy is a metabolic program that is highly utilized by TNBC cells to survive, particularly upon
exposure to chemotherapy (6). While reagents such as chloroquine can block autophagy, their clinical impact is
yet to be realized due to unknown mechanisms of action and toxicity (7,8). However, focusing on specific key
nodes that regulate the program with highly selective inhibitors is possible. Investigating upstream initiators of
the autophagy program, emerging evidence from our group demonstrates that Unc-51 like kinase 3 (ULK3)
expression, as opposed to the more commonly studied ULK1, correlates with TNBC aggressiveness. Further,
genetic analyses confirm a key role for ULK3 in controlling TNBC autophagy and survival. No ULK3 inhibitors
currently exist but excitingly, we have generated novel ULK3 selective inhibitors that are effective in preliminary
in vitro experiments. Here, we plan to focus on our lead ULK3 inhibitor, RF1024, to test our hypothesis that ULK3
is a tractable and therapeutic target for the effective treatment of triple negative breast cancer.
Proposed studies: In Aim 1 we will assess the efficacy of RF1024 in limiting TNBC growth in vitro using
immortalized cell lines and in vivo using two preclinical metastatic TNBC models (4T1, SUM159). In Aim 2, we
will determine ULK3 expression in TNBC patients. We will also investigate autophagy status and ULK3 levels as
a response/prognosis biomarker in a robust data set of TNBC patient biopsies. We propose to determine a
retrospective study (patient samples from 2010 - to date) on TNBC patient specimens collected at Moffitt with
the purpose to validate for the first time ULK3 protein as a possible biomarker. At the conclusion of our studies,
we expect to have fully interrogated the efficacy of a novel ULK3 inhibitor that can be rapidly translated to the
clinical setting for the treatment of TNBC patients"

This submission by Hillary Lum, MD, PhD for the NIH Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented
Research (K24) enables Dr. Lum to: 1) mentor junior clinical investigators in dementia care research, and 2)
enhance the science of community-engaged research and co-design methods involving persons affected by
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Dr. Lum is a geriatrician, palliative medicine physician,
and prior Beeson Scholar with an independent ADRD research program, ADRD team-science collaborations, a
national reputation in ADRD palliative care research, and a strong record of grants and publications.
Mentorship: Over the last decade, Dr. Lum has mentored more than 30 residents, fellows, and junior clinical
investigators in geriatrics, palliative care, neurology, and other patient-oriented aging disciplines. She has
research mentorship leadership roles including serving as Co-Director of the NIA T32 Multidisciplinary
Palliative Care in Aging Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program and Associate Director of the NCATS Clinical
Faculty Scholars Program at the University of Colorado. Her mentoring objectives are to increase the pipeline
of ADRD and geriatric investigators who progress to independence, and to lead institutional and national
ADRD and geriatric patient-oriented research mentorship programs.
Research theme: Dr. Lum's research integrates community-engaged research and co-design methods into
real-world intervention design, testing, and implementation to improve care for persons living with dementia
and family care partners. Community-engaged research is the process of working collaboratively with patients
and others during conceptualization, conduct, and dissemination of research. Co-design methods, focusing on
developing interventions, are part of community engaged research. As an example of community-engaged
research in ADRD, Dr. Lum convened a “Memory Tech Council” of patients, care partners, and community
members to identify priorities for use of consumer health information technology embedded in the health
system to improve dementia care. This K24 proposal will provide Dr. Lum with protected time to advance the
science of engagement in ADRD by focusing on: 1) expanding capacity for junior investigators to integrate
engagement methods into their ADRD research; 2) identifying community-engaged research methods for
partnering with persons living with dementia and care partners; and 3) organizing co-design tools for dementia
care interventions into a new online resource for dementia care researchers.
Impact: Through this K24 award, Dr. Lum will enhance the science of engagement in ADRD, enhance her
mentorship through current and new research mentorship roles at University of Colorado and nationally, and
enhance the field through a pipeline of clinical investigators in ADRD and patient-oriented aging research."
10794989,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Memory for events in the recent past is crucial for effective functioning in everyday environments.
Imagine someone is retiring and moving to a new city to be with family. Event memory will allow them
to remember how to get to the grocery store and in which aisle to look for cereal, which neighbor's
child to ask about mowing the lawn, and whether it is late enough to check if the mail has arrived.
Failures of event memory are exactly the problems that bring elders into the neurological clinic and
raise concerns that they may be developing Alzheimer's disease (AD)—both major epidemiological
concerns, given that the population of older adults and the number of people with AD are growing
dramatically. However, there is a large gap between this kind of memory and memory as it is usually
studied in the psychological and neuroscientific laboratory, by presenting people with disconnected
words, pictures, or sentences.
 Recent empirical and theoretical results have identified specialized neural and computational
mechanisms that segment ongoing activity into meaningful events and have shown that these
mechanisms are important for memory formation. In this proposal, we describe a novel synthesis and
extension of previous approaches to the effects of age and AD on memory, based on these
innovations. This synthesis opens up an opportunity to better understand how the mechanisms of
human memory encoding change with age and AD, and at the same time to test the potential of novel
interventions for potential clinical application to memory improvement. This project will capitalize on
this opportunity, achieving three specific aims:
 Specific Aim 1 will test whether and how attention to event segmentation improves elders'
memory for everyday activity at delays from minutes to week. Two well-powered experiments will
extend a promising intervention that has been shown to improve event memory in young adults to
older adult samples, testing memory at delays up to one month.
 Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that effective event segmentation improves the
resolution of elders' posterior/medial memory representations. Structures in the
medial temporal lobes and posterior medial parietal cortex have been shown to be important for event
memory and are affected by healthy aging and early AD. Two studies will test whether improving
event segmentation improves the resolution of memory representations in these regions.
 Specific Aim 3 will test whether the mechanisms and consequences of segmentation
improvement are maintained or impaired by early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Early AD
selectively impairs the very systems that are proposed to be important for representing event
memories. Two studies will test the possibility that improving event segmentation improves event
memory in people with early symptomatic AD."
10796988,"It is increasingly clear that women are more vulnerable than men to some of the negative effects of chronic
alcohol consumption, including immune system dysfunction and neurodegeneration. This is important since the
rates of problem drinking in women are rapidly increasing, and the currently available treatments are only
moderately effective. There is mounting evidence that men and women drink for different reasons. Women
tend to drink to regulate stress and negative affect, whereas men report drinking for alcohol-related positive
reinforcement. This provides an important opportunity to explore sex-appropriate treatments. In particular, we
need to understand the neurochemical mechanisms that underlie and contribute to these behavioral sex
differences in order to provide new treatment targets for medication development. In this proposed Yale-
SCORE, Project 2 will focus on identifying sex differences in biomarkers of alcohol-induced neurodegeneration
that lead to neural adaptations that drive the addiction cycle. Using state-of-the-art positron emission
tomography (PET) technology, we will examine sex differences in levels of microglia and synaptic density in
living individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Microglia, the brains’ resident immune cells, are involved in a
variety of physiologic and pathologic processes, most notably surveying the brains’ environment for danger
and carrying out necessary repair functions. Alcohol initially activates microglia but chronic consumption has
been shown to suppress both peripheral and neuroimmune systems. We have preliminary data suggesting
more severe neuroimmune suppression in women vs. men with AUD, which may underlie the findings that
women with AUD exhibit worse mood and neurocognitive dysfunction than men. Microglia are also critical for
supporting synaptic structure and function and conversely, microglial dysfunction leads to deficits in synapse
number and contributes to mood and cognitive impairment. However, the relationships between microglia,
synaptic density, stress, mood, and neurocognitive function in living humans with AUD are not known. In the
current study, we will examine whether chronic alcohol consumption is associated with reductions in microglia
(Aim 1) and synaptic density (Aim 2) and if the impairment varies by sex. We hypothesize that women with
AUD evidence greater deficits in microglia and synaptic density, which underlie sex differences in stress
reactivity, negative affect, and neurocognitive dysfunction in AUD (Aim 3). Thus, the proposed project has the
potential to measure, for the first time, sex differences in neurochemical markers of neurodegeneration in the
living brain of patients with AUD and their relationship to critical clinical outcomes. These findings will advance
the alcohol field by uncovering novel, sex-appropriate treatment targets."
10796990,"The role of Project 3 is to identify and translate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the ‘dark side
of addiction’ studied across Projects 1 and 2. Women have higher stress reactivity and higher rates of
depressive symptoms than men that may underlie their increased likelihood of chronic drinking. Since women
are particularly sensitive to effects of stress on negative reinforcement drinking (NRD, see Overall Section), a
primary aim of Project 3 is to identify mechanisms related to NRD and related treatments. The amygdala is a
sexually-dimorphic structure essential for stress reactivity, and both norepinephrine (NE) and GABA signaling
are critical for stress-induced behaviors. Based on the established role of GABA and NE in response to both
stress and alcohol use, we hypothesize that the increased susceptibility to chronic alcohol use and relapse in
women is partly due to sex differences in GABA-NE balance in subregions of the amygdala. We have shown
that guanfacine, a NE agonist at α2A receptors, decreases activity of amygdala neurons and induces
anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects, with sex-dependent patterns of neuronal activation. We therefore
hypothesize that targeting pre- and postsynaptic NE receptors or activating GABA neurons will counteract
NRD, and could have synergistic effects on amygdala neuronal activity and behaviors induced by stress. We
further hypothesize that these neuronal mechanisms interact with neuroinflammatory pathways, such as
microglial activation, to modify synaptic structure in the brain area, and that targeting these neuroadaptations
could alter NRD in a sex-dependent manner. Finally, we know that alcohol metabolism differs in men and
women, and have identified a greater effect of decreased brain metabolism of ethanol in female compared to
male mice. In Project 3, we will 1) determine whether targeting noradrenergic receptors decrease overall
ethanol intake, as well as NRD in female and male mice, 2) determine whether NE manipulations and GABA
neuron activity in the amygdala have synergistic effects on NRD in female and male mice using molecular
genetics to target specific GABAergic circuit mechanisms, 3) determine the effects of noradrenergic receptors
and GABA neuron activity on ethanol-induced microglia alteration and synaptic density in female and male
mice, and 4) identify interactions between brain alcohol metabolism and these signaling pathways in NRD.
These studies will provide mechanistic data relevant for studies in Projects 1 and 2 to identify brain
mechanisms that may modulate stress-related alcohol use in a sex-dependent manner, and to determine how
this contributes to sex differences in alcohol-related behaviors."

was successful in reaching the major goals and objectives for the funding cycle and accomplishments were
significant. In the present renewal application, we are proposing to build up from previous accomplishments to
move forward to the next level of competitiveness. The renewal application will consist of five Core Units
(Administration, Research Faculty Recruitment, Center for Research Resources, Community Training for Health
Disparities (CTIHD) and the Strategic Pipeline for Academic Research Career Success (SPARCS) and three full
research projects. These research projects are designed to provide answer to critical questions in the area of
health disparities. They include these studies: “Sex Difference in a rodent model of co-occurrence of chronic
stress and cocaine use disorder” (Basic Full Research Project). “Testing Bridges to Better Health and Wellness
for People Living with Serious Mental Illness in Puerto Rico” (Behavioral Full Research Project) and” Spleen
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition to Target Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Asthma” (Clinical Full Research Project).
These studies promise to shed light on fundamental details leading to health disparities in our most
disadvantaged communities. The RCMI Center will continue to be spearheaded by Jose A. Torres-Ruiz, Ph.D.,

all proposed activities under the renewal RCMI application will be assessed by the RCMI Internal and External
Advisory Committees, and by the Monitoring and Evaluation Team (Nexos). The Monitoring and Evaluation
Team will review and implement the formative and summative evaluation plans across the PHSU-RCMI Center.
The evaluation plans will be developed to assess the effectiveness of the Center to continue building research
infrastructure to support development of high quality basic, behavioral, clinical, and translational research
activities with strong emphasis on addressing minority health and health disparities. The external team will
evaluate the progress of the center in fulfilling the mission of the overall program and its core objectives based
on the measure of progress toward achieving short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals. The development
of the PHSU RCMI Center will be supported by an aggressive recruitment of well-trained researchers in the
RCMI targeted areas and the expansion of PHSU building facilities. The Center will also benefit from a robust
institutional commitment and continuity of leadership across the Cores."

10793989,"The goal of this competitive renewal is to interrogate a paradigm-shifting hypothesis that a combination of CB-
839, a glutaminase inhibitor, and 5-FU induces neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in PIK3CA mutant colorectal
cancers (CRCs), which in turn kills these cancer cells. NETs are extracellular web-like structures of cytosolic and
granule proteins assembled on de-condensed chromatin. NETs trap and kill bacteria, fungi, viruses, and
parasites. Although some studies implicate NETs in tumor metastasis, whether NETs can kill cancer cells is
largely unexplored. This proposal is built on the novel findings that we made during the current funding period:
1) PIK3CA mutations render CRCs more dependent on glutamine; 2) CB-839 preferentially inhibits xenograft
growth of PIK3CA mutant CRCs; 3) the combination of CB-839 with 5-FU induces xenograft tumor regression of
PIK3CA mutant CRC in nude mice; 4) the combination of CB-839 and 5-FU preferentially induces NETs in
PIK3CA mutant CRCs; 5) depletion of neutrophils in nude mice significantly attenuates the efficacy of the drug
combination; 6) disruption of NETs by DNase I treatment in xenograft tumors also attenuates the efficacy of the
drug combination. These exciting observations lead us to hypothesize that NETs induced by the drug
combination kill PIK3CA mutant CRCs. Two aims are proposed to test this exceptionally novel hypothesis. Aim
1 will determine if the combination of CB-839 and 5-FU induces NETs in immune-competent mice and human
CRC patients. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanisms by which NETs kill PIK3CA mutant CRCs. Although we focus
on colon cancer in this proposal, our proposed studies may have a broader impact beyond colorectal cancer
because PIK3CA is mutated in ~ 20% of all human cancer. Moreover, the mechanisms identified in the study
may also apply to other NET-related diseases."
10796844,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Breast cancer growth and progression require complex interactions between tumor cells and their
surrounding environment. Increased numbers of infiltrating inflammatory cells, in particular macrophages,
correlate with poor patient prognosis in breast cancer. Our studies have focused on identifying key
macrophage subpopulations that contribute to mammary tumor growth and progression. Based on studies in
the normal mammary gland, we have identified a stromal macrophage population that is associated with
remodeling hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix and is capable of promoting tumor cell invasion. These
macrophages are localized specifically to hyaluronan-enriched regions in the peri-tumoral stroma. Based on
our preliminary results, we hypothesize that this macrophage subpopulation represents a distinct tissue
resident-derived tumor associated macrophage population that contributes to breast cancer progression
through binding to and remodeling the hyaluronan-containing extracellular matrix. Studies proposed in
Specific Aim 1 will define the localization and source of this macrophage subpopulation using mouse models
of breast cancer. Studies proposed in Specific Aim 2 will delineate the key mechanisms through which these
macrophages contribute to extracellular matrix remodeling and drive tumor cell invasion. Finally, studies
proposed in Specific Aim 3 will define the localization of this macrophage subpopulation in human breast
cancers and use spatial transcriptomics to identify the local environment surrounding these macrophages.
Recent studies have highlighted the extensive functional diversity of macrophages in both normal
homeostasis and in various diseases, including cancer. Delineating the specific mechanisms that contribute
to macrophage heterogeneity and defining their functional contributions within the tumor microenvironment
are critical for developing strategies to effectively target this diverse population of cells."

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare, chronic autoimmune connective tissue disease affecting 60,000 – 100,000
people in the US. One main driver of physical disability in patients with SSc is upper extremity (UE) limitations
due to vascular and skin changes. These disease changes reduce joint movement, cause pain, and when not
treated early, can lead to permanent UE functional loss and rigidity, in the form of nonmalleable joint contractures.
Along with conventional pharmacological treatments to counteract disease severity, rehabilitation is
recommended to improve UE function and prevent long-lasting disability. Unfortunately, rehabilitation is only not
highly utilized and there are several barriers to receiving rehabilitation services. Access and travel to SSc
specialty centers are barriers, and traveling to repeated in-person sessions is not often logistically possible for
patients. In addition, the evidence base for rehabilitation does not consist of replicable protocol-based treatments
and relies on therapist expertise which results in variable care. The proposed study is designed to plan a multisite
randomized clinical trial with specialty centers and community sites to assess the efficacy of a telerehab
approach to improve UE function in patients with SSc. This is the result of several years of pilot testing and
preliminary work establishing a standard protocol for therapy and testing telerehab methods of treatment. The
planning for this multisite efficacy trial will result in adequate preparation and submission of a U01 application to
conduct the trial. We hypothesize that a supervised and tailored UE telerehab program will lead to improved UE
function in patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc compared to general education about symptom management.
We propose the following aims: 1. Establish our multisite research team that includes occupational therapists
who will serve as interventionists for the trial. 2. Complete the necessary milestones that will prepare us for a
successful U01 project application: 1) Design and refine a multisite clinical trial protocol; 2) Develop a Manual of
Operations and Procedures; 3) Refine telehealth platform and content; 4) Develop site-specific recruitment plans;
5) Develop a Data Safety and Monitoring Plan; 6) Establish our Data Management Plan; 7) Prepare and submit
single-site IRB application; 8) Create training materials for the interventionists and therapist assessor; and 9)
Conduct intervention fidelity training and test study processes. The proposed plan is the first step in examining
the efficacy of UE telerehab intervention that has the potential to be scalable and translatable into clinical
practice. Results of the trial would have implications for ongoing reimbursement for telerehab services and
potentially provide broader access to treatment of this rare condition. In addition, these methods could be applied
to other rheumatological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus."

Cilia are complex structures with more than 1,300 proteins involved in their formation and function. During
development, disruption of cilia function causes gestational lethality and mild to severe birth defects. Variants in
cilia proteins are causally associated with more than 35 ciliopathy syndromes. Ciliopathy patients have a wide
range of phenotypes affecting nearly every organ system. Despite the cilium's clinical importance, the functions
of the cilium and molecular pathways the cilium regulates are poorly defined. To understand the
pathophysiological mechanisms driving ciliopathy birth defects, we are extending and utilizing protocols,
expertise, and tools developed within the UAB U54 Center for Precision Animal Modeling (CPAM). We will
identify and characterize variants of interest derived from patient and variant repositories from local, regional,
and national/international sources. Both variants of unknown significance (VUS) in known ciliopathy genes and
predicted deleterious variants of interest identified in novel candidate ciliopathy genes that we prioritize through
this application will be selected. Each variant will undergo robust assessment based on known or predicted
deleteriousness, pathway and protein interactions, and phenotype and functional associations as compared to
known ciliopathies. Prioritized variants will be subjected to a robust wet lab process to test pathogenicity,
determine ciliopathy protein cellular localization, and screen rapidly for cilia related phenotypes in zebrafish F0
Crispant mutants. For variants that remain highly prioritized after these steps, we will generate precision
engineered mouse models corresponding to the patient variant. These models will undergo phenotype analyses
to assess the clinical correlation between the model and the patient. We will analyze the variant's impact on cilia
assembly, morphology, formation of specialized cilia sub-compartments, and disruption of cilia protein interaction
networks. We will determine the impact of the variant on developmental signaling pathways known to be
associated with the cilium as well as identify novel pathways not previously identified as being regulated by the
cilium. To accomplish the goals of project, we have assembled a team with a wide range of expertise in medicine,
genetics and molecular diagnostics, computational biology, bioinformatics, and data science, biochemistry, cell
biology, and animal model generation and phenotyping. Collectively we will confirm the functional impact of
variants identified in patients with ciliopathy-like birth defects and patients with variants in genes predicted but
not already well known to affect the cilium or its activity. The outcomes from this project will uncover novel cilia
protein interactions and subcomplexes involved in cilia formation and maintenance, cilia protein transport, and
cilia sensory and signaling activities. This work will also support definitive diagnoses for patients with cilia
associated birth defects and generate data that can be used to predict potential therapeutic strategies. We will
also develop and disseminate patient relevant models and bioinformatics tools for the broader community."
10799600,"This is the 2​nd renewal application of the Alpert Medical School Summer Research Program
(AMSSRP). The ​overall goal of the AMSSRP is to provide ​12 ​medical students with the
opportunity to have a mentored research experience annually under the guidance of Brown
University faculty. Designated faculty trainers are the principal investigators for research
programs focused on the molecular basis and pathology of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and
blood diseases and/or disease outcomes and prevention. The current program offers 8 medical
students, who have just completed their 1​ year of medical school, a 9 week summer research
st
experience that includes a collaborative, multidisciplinary, mentored research project, didactic
training, and career development activities to enhance their understanding, and give them the
hands-on experience of a career as a physician-scientist. The AMSSRP is geared to expose
students to the critical role played by physician-scientists in translational research and to inspire
these students to embark on this career path of exploration and discovery.
NIH has consistently made translational and ‘bench-to-bedside’ research a priority. However,
the increase in NIH support of biomedical basic research has not correlated with an increase in
the discovery of efficacious therapies or diagnostics to battle human diseases. This disparity
may be due in part to the decrease in the number of physicians who pursue research careers, a
decline that may result from a lack of mentorship, rising costs of medical school education, the
length of time of MD-PhD programs, and a perception that physician-scientists are not as highly
regarded as clinicians in the hospital setting. In addition, developing knowledge base and
research skill competencies for clinically trained physicians is time consuming and often learned
outside of medical school didactics. The AMSSRP serves to dispel this trend by partnering
medical students with successful and active mentors engaged in cutting edge research and
exposing them to the excitement of biomedical research discoveries related to cardiovascular,
pulmonary and blood health and diseases during their medical school years. By engaging
medical students early in their training, we hope to stimulate a lifelong drive of scientific inquiry
and a successful research career."

Mitochondria are essential for cellular function and organism viability. These organelles are well known for their
production of ATP, the primary energy currency of most eukaryotic cells. Less well known are the plethora of
other functions these organelles have including production of signaling molecules, regulation of apoptotic
signaling cascades, serving as a calcium sink, and also being the primary storage and utilization site of iron in
the cell. To serve these diverse functions, mitochondria must be properly localized in all cells; however, this
organelle is particularly critical in neurons. Neurons are highly metabolically active, electrically polarized, and
can have an enormous volume making regulation of the mitochondrial population particularly challenging.
Likely due to the high metabolic demands of this cell, precise control of mitochondrial localization and
maintenance of mitochondrial health are essential for neuronal survival. Abnormal mitochondrial localization,
health, and function have been linked to many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease. In
Alzheimer’s, defects in mitochondrial calcium load and contacts with the endoplasmic reticulum have both
been noted. Additionally, advanced neuroimaging of early-stage patients revealed defects in mitochondrial
function, making understanding how mitochondrial function is maintained in neurons paramount to
understanding disease biology. While the last several decades have revealed fascinating insights into
mitochondrial biology in neurons, we still do not have a thorough understanding of how the population of
mitochondria is maintained over the long life of the neuron. Anterograde transport is critical for bringing healthy
organelles from the cell body into the long axonal process which can extend a meter from the cell body in
humans. Conversely, retrograde transport moves aged or damaged organelles towards to cell body. Once
damaged organelles reach the cell body, some undergo targeted degradation. The fate of the bulk of these
organelles and the source of healthy mitochondria has not been defined. We have developed an in vivo system
to address these long-standing questions in the field. Using zebrafish neurons, we can image mitochondrial
localization, health, and transport in vivo in a fully intact neural circuit. We have developed transgenic lines,
genetic tools, and imaging approaches to individually label mitochondria to track them and follow their lifetime
and biogenesis in neurons. This will allow us to determine the source of healthy mitochondria necessary for
maintenance of the population in neurons (Aim 1). Independently, we designed a strategy to define the
mechanism of motor-mitochondria attachment specifically necessary for retrograde transport of the organelle
(Aim 2). Together, the proposed experiments will provide mechanistic insight into how and why mitochondria
move in the retrograde direction while also defining the source of healthy organelles necessary for
maintenance of the mitochondrial population in neurons. The knowledge gained will enhance our insight into
the basic biology of the cell that can be repurposed for potential therapeutic interventions."

This project proposes to revolutionize image-guided surgery (IGS) technology by tracking surgical modiﬁcations
in real time. IGS has profoundly changed modern endoscopic surgical techniques by allowing surgeons to
visualize pathologies that are not visible by endoscopy, to direct surgical instruments through the patient's
anatomy. However, revcurrent IGS is a static mechanism and can neither dynamically track surgery nor update
IGS reference images by CT or MRI in real time. The reference images easily deviate from the actual anatomy
and pathology during surgery, and surgeons must rely on memory to ensure the correctness and completeness of
the resection. This is more pronounced when the surgery covers a big area or involves soft tissue. In endoscopic
sinus and skull base surgery (ESSBS), for example, the surgery involves the wide sinus and skull base area,
which is a honeycomb-shaped structure surrounded by dense blood vessels and nerves. revDriven by ensuring the
safety of the patient during the operation, there is a reluctance to avoid more eﬀective but riskier resections.
This results in a currently accepted revision rate of ESSBS of up to 28%. By real-time tracking and guiding,
the precision of surgery would be dramatically increased, leading to far greater success in surgery, with a vastly
reduced percentage of required revision surgery.
This design approach will focus on the ability to track modiﬁcation and update images in real-time through
system optimization and advanced algorithms. revThe project will use a novel deep causal learning (DCL)
framework to break the bottleneck that results from the current unpredictable adverse factors in operating
rooms. The framework will use invertible nets to learn from data and clinical knowledge and identify, isolate,
and compensate for the adverse factors, leading to a realistic solution to this problem. A research team has been
assembled including surgeons, and computer scientists, to identify the limitations and challenges to formulate
a research plan to redesign the utility of IGS information to track surgery in real-time. The team will rely on
years of previous collaboration together to verify the feasibility of motion-based modiﬁcation tracking. More
speciﬁcally, this project will use motion and endoscopic videos (Aims 1 and 2) to independently track surgical
modiﬁcations. The two methods are based on the DCL framework, and the tracking results not only have
accuracy and estimated conﬁdence but will include the impacts of adverse factors as well. Moreover, the project
will fuse the two methods and verify clinical usability in the operating room environment (Aim 3).
revThis project will achieve reliable real-time updates of IGS in real clinical environments, and directly improve
the reliability of ESSBS surgical navigation. The project will pioneer tracking of surgical modiﬁcation when both
deformation and modiﬁcation are present, and extend the application of IGS to a broader array of endoscopic
surgeries. The use of causal learning to solve the medical modeling problem will be explored, thus paving the
way for using current and prior medical knowledge to formulate critical new learning of IGS procedures."
10796203,"Project Summary
The long-term goal of our work is to identify genetic variants that suppress intravascular blood clotting
called thrombosis or venous thromboembolism (VTE). We previously use a genome wide mutation
screen in mice to identify 10 dominant genetic variants that suppressed lethal thrombosis. Several
of these mutations are in genes which, when mutated, enable mice with a lethal thrombosis genotype
to survive. Arl6ip5 is one such gene. This gene and its protein product, also known as JWA, Praf3
etc. has multiple putative cellular and organismal functions, overlapping with Actr2 (Arp2, part of the
Arp2/3 complex). Our central hypothesis is that Arl6ip5 deficiency affects thrombosis by altering
essential cellular functions via cytoskeletal and transcriptional pathways. These in turn affect platelet
reactivity, gene transcription, and the kinetics of thrombosis.
We will complete the Specific Aims of our project by performing assays on our genome edited mouse
model of Arl6ip5 deficiency. Specific AIM 1 will investigate the ability of complete Arl6ip5 deficiency
to increase thrombosis suppression relative to partial Arl6ip5 deficiency. We will also investigate the
effects of Arl6ip5 on tail bleeding and Rose Bengal induced arterial and venous thrombosis. Specific
AIM 2 experiments will probe Arl6ip5 deficient platelets for functional and transcriptional defects
using targeted platelet assays and platelet RNA sequencing. To follow up on the plasma activated
partial thrombosplastin time (APTT) defect we observed in Arl6ip5 deficient mice, we will perform
detailed studies on blood and plasma, including the measurement of coagulation factor levels and
liver RNA sequencing to determine the molecular genetic pathway leading to this effect. Both male
and female mice will be testing to ensure the rigor and thoroughness of our studies.
The completion of the proposed studies will provide the first evidence of the role Arl6ip5 gene
mutations play in regulating hemostasis. These questions are highly impactful to the mission of the
NIH because they provide critical information about the regulation of thrombi, a widespread killer
causing heart attacks, strokes, and VTE. Increased fundamental knowledge of this process could
provide better insights into preventative and therapeutic strategies. These studies will also be used
to train the next generation of cardiovascular researchers in the proper conduct of scientific studies,
preparing them for outstanding independent scientific careers in cardiovascular research. The
funding of this grant will further contribute to the outstanding training environment of the Oakland
University Department of Biological Sciences, which has been doing an outstanding job of
contributing scientists to graduate and postdoctoral training programs in cardiovascular research."
10799545,"SUMMARY: CD8 T cells are a critical part of the immune system that protect against intracellular pathogens and
cancer. This protection is achieved by the T cell’s ability to target and kill tumor cells or cells infected with a
pathogen. Upon clearance of the diseased cells, pathogen-specific CD8 T cells can persist for the life of the host,
ready to rapidly recall their killing functions if the source of the antigen returns. This poised state of memory T
cells is the basis for long-lived immunity. However, if the source of the disease is not initially cleared, as occurs
during chronic infections or cancers, the killing functions of pathogen-specific CD8 T cells are progressively
reduced, commonly referred to as T cell exhaustion. This reduction in T cell mediated killing limits the ability of
the immune system to control tumor progression. Recent breakthroughs in our understanding of T cell
exhaustion have revealed that the non-functional state can be temporarily reversed by therapies that block
receptor signaling (PD-1) on the T cell, enabling T cell mediated tumor control. In light of the tremendous
therapeutic effect PD-1 blockade has on controlling tumor progression, the FDA has recently approved it for
clinical use. While PD-1 blockade therapy clearly controls tumor progression, the temporarily reactivated CD8
T cells retain a memory of the non-functional state. Therefore, a current challenge for the field is to identify the
cell-intrinsic properties that maintain T cell exhaustion after PD-1 treatment. We have recently demonstrated that
epigenetic modifications (modifications to the genome that are maintained during cell division) acquired during
prolonged antigen exposure reinforces T cell exhaustion by maintaining exhaustion-specific gene expression
programs. We hypothesize that these epigenetic programs are a major barrier for therapeutic strategies that
aim to reprogram exhausted tumor-specific T cells. Therefore, the aims of our proposal are 1) To identify de
novo DNA methylation programs that reinforce commitment of T cell exhaustion in mouse and human
tumor-specific CD8 T cells. 2) To erase de novo DNA methylation programs that constrain rejuvenation
of exhausted CD8 T cells during immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). 3) To determine if CAR T cell
exhaustion is regulated by de novo DNA methylation. The research proposed here will broadly identify gene
expression programs in antigen-specific CD8 T cells that inhibit anti-tumor functions, and will provide new insight
into the cell-intrinsic mechanisms for maintenance of exhaustion programs. These studies will provide a
foundation for developing methods to reprogram exhausted CD8 T cells to sustain effector potential during and
after immune checkpoint blockade and CAR T-cell therapies."
10806643,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The complexity and multifactorial nature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pose unique challenges for mechanistic
studies and developing therapies. Emerging evidence strongly suggests that AD is a consequence of age-
dependent neural network dysfunction in brain regions that mostly affect cognition, likely through interactive
effects of multiple pathogenic factors, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), TAU, and amyloid-beta (Aβ).
APOE4, the major genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, increases AD risk and lowers the age of disease onset
in a gene dose-dependent manner, whereas APOE2 is a strongly protective genetic factor in late-onset AD. Two
major pathological hallmarks of AD are intraneuronal tangles of hyperphosphorylated TAU and extracellular
amyloid plaques of Aβ aggregates. In cell cultures and mouse models, APOE isoforms have Aβ- and TAU-
dependent differential effects, and Aβ and TAU have APOE isoform-dependent effects, suggesting interactive
roles of these factors in AD pathogenesis. However, almost all of these studies of APOE isoforms, Aβ, and TAU
drew conclusions based on co-expression of mutant human APP, which is associated with early-onset but not
late-onset AD, or mutant TAU, which is associated with frontotemporal dementia but not AD.
Recently, a rare APOE variant, APOE3-R136S (APOE3-Christchurch), was found to protect against early-onset
AD in a PSEN1-E280A carrier, further highlighting the importance of studying the rare variants of APOE in AD
pathogenesis and protection. However, it is unknown whether the R136S mutation also protects against APOE4-
driven effects in late-onset AD in the context of wildtype (WT) human TAU and APP. In this project, we propose
to determine the potential protective effects of APOE-R136S on APOE4-driven neural network dysfunction,
behavioral deficits, and pathologies, in the context of WT human TAU, WT APP with humanized Aβ1-42, or both,
in novel mouse models of AD, and to explore the underlying cellular, molecular, and transcriptomic mechanisms.
In Aim 1, we will determine the potential protective roles of APOE-R136S in novel AD mouse models expressing
different human APOE isoforms and WT human TAU. In Aim 2, we will determine the potential protective roles
of APOE-R136S in novel AD mouse models expressing different human APOE isoforms and WT APP with
humanized Aβ1-42. In Aim 3, we will determine the potential protective roles of APOE-R136S in novel AD mouse
models expressing different human APOE isoforms with both WT human TAU and WT APP with humanized
Aβ1-42. The studies in this project will yield new insights into the multifactorial pathogenesis of AD, reveal cellular,
molecular, and transcriptomic mechanisms underlying the protective roles of APOE-R136S in AD, and may
identify novel targets for developing APOE-dependent therapies to treat or prevent AD."

10809805,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neuronal type identity is central to the development and function of neural circuits, as it instructs both the
connectivity of neurons as well as their synaptic and electrophysiological properties. Neuronal fates are thought
to be controlled by combinations of transcription factors (TF) known as terminal selectors, but very little is known
about the gene regulatory mechanisms that link differential TF expression to specific neuronal features. The
Drosophila visual system, a well-characterized brain region that has an organization analogous to the vertebrate
retina and cortex, provides the ideal balance of complexity and accessibility to investigate these mechanisms.
The first aim of this project will be to decipher the terminal selector TF codes that establish and maintain the
unique identity of approximately 200 neuronal types that make the Drosophila optic lobes. Using a single-cell
RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset I generated from developing optic lobes, I identified the combinations of
TFs that are stably maintained in each neuronal type throughout their differentiation. Under the mentorship of
Claude Desplan (K99 phase), I will test the hypothesis that these TFs function as terminal selectors by modifying
the TF codes of specific optic lobe neurons in vivo, with the goal of predictably transdifferentiating them into other
cell types. This will demonstrate the sufficiency of terminal selectors to confer neuronal identity and benefit the
field of regenerative medicine. The conserved mechanisms in mammalian systems could be exploited to induce
differentiation of pluripotent cells into specific neurons that could be transplanted to treat blindness or
neurodegeneration. The second aim of this project will link the terminal selector TFs to their downstream targets.
In collaboration with Richard Bonneau, I will learn to use the “Inferelator” algorithm to generate computational
models of gene regulatory networks by combining my existing scRNA-seq data with new chromatin accessibility
(scATAC-seq) data I will acquire. During the K99 phase, I will test the effects of perturbating key predicted
downstream effectors on the morphology and connectivity of a select group of neurons to establish proof-of-
concept. I will then generalize this approach in the R00 phase by inferring gene regulatory networks for all optic
lobe neurons at multiple developmental stages. The third aim will be performed in my independent lab (R00) to
utilize the network models for engineering precise modifications in visual circuits. I will seek to selectively
uncouple the circuit that computes wide-field motion from the one that detects small moving objects. I will use
synaptic tracing methods as well as intravital calcium imaging to demonstrate the functional consequences of
developmental perturbations. Altogether, this project will establish direct mechanistic links between the encoding
of neuronal identity and the molecules that mediate intercellular interactions during synaptic partner selection,
which are commonly affected in neurodevelopmental disorders. The mentorship I will receive from Dr. Desplan
and Dr. Bonneau, combined with the impressive resources of New York University provide the ideal environment
for preparing me to build a successful independent research program that link gene regulation to brain wiring."
10809807,"One in 26 people experience epilepsy at some point in their life and temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common
adult focal epilepsy. New and innovative therapies are required to treat the many cases of temporal lobe epilepsy
that are poorly controlled with conventional medications. Ideally, treatments should be based on a detailed
understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to seizures, but these biological mechanisms are poorly
understood. The conventional approach is to surgically remove the seizure “focus” in attempts to alleviate
seizures, but identifying the focus is challenging. Even in cases when the focus is ostensibly clear, surgery may
not prevent seizures. An alternative hypothesis is that even classically focal epilepsies, such as temporal lobe
epilepsy, rely on more distributed brain networks. One such network that is well-positioned to support seizures
is the Papez circuit, which embeds the hippocampus, a classic seizure focus, in a recurrent excitatory network.
Preliminary work demonstrates that the medial mammillary body, the hypothalamic node of this circuit, drives
synchronous network events in the hippocampus and highlights a potential role as an external controller for
pathologically synchronous states (i.e., epileptiform events). Using transgenic mouse lines and cell-type-specific
tools, two divergent pathways from the medial mammillary body will be investigated to determine 1) how seizure
activity spreads through these pathways, 2) whether these pathways are necessary and sufficient for seizure
activity, and 3) if targeted, non-invasive neuromodulation with ultrasound can control seizure activity. Completing
this grant will advance our understanding of the mechanisms that generate seizure activity and take a first step
towards translation using a clinically relevant treatment modality. The candidate's long-term goal is to establish
an independent research program that sheds light on the organization and function of networks that support
physiological processes (e.g., memory) and pathological seizures. To attain this goal, the candidate has outlined
a comprehensive, personalized program that identifies plans for career development in research training,
neuroscience knowledge, technique development, grantsmanship, scientific management, and others. This
training plan outlines a pathway to independence (i.e., from postdoc to establishing their own laboratory) that
has a realistic timeline and is supported excellent resources at Stanford University, collaboration, and an
established mentor with extensive experience relevant to this goal."
10807260,"Abstract:
All individuals with type 1 and >30% of those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1/2DM) require intensive insulin
therapy to manage their blood glucose levels. This therapy comes at a great price: increased incidence of
iatrogenic insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia is not only acutely life-threatening,
repeated hypoglycemia (RH) impairs the ability of the brain to detect and correct subsequent hypoglycemia
allowing glucose levels to fall to dangerous, even lethal, levels. Declining glucose first triggers the hormonal
(e.g., glucagon, epinephrine) counterregulatory response (CRR) to stimulate gluconeogenesis. Further glucose
decline leads to the behavioral response known as hypoglycemia awareness which includes neurogenic (e.g.,
palpitations, anxiety) and neuroglycopenic (e.g., tiredness, confusion) symptoms that alert the individual of
hypoglycemia. RH impairs these hormonal and behavioral responses leading to hypoglycemia associated
autonomic failure (HAAF) and hypoglycemia unawareness, respectively. While the CRR and HAAF have been
studied extensively, little is known about the mechanisms underlying hypoglycemia awareness/unawareness.
This oversight was due to lack of an animal model. However, the Levin lab recently developed a rat model for
hypoglycemia awareness which we have translated into the mouse. This model enables us for the first time to
investigate how RH causes hypoglycemia unawareness. Our data suggest that orexin expressing neurons in the
perifornical hypothalamus (PFH) which are inhibited by glucose (glucose inhibited or GI) play a role in
hypoglycemia awareness. We find that RH blunts activation of PFH orexin-GI neuron in low glucose. Using our
mouse model of hypoglycemia awareness/unawareness we have shown that the dopamine reuptake inhibitor
modafinil restores hypoglycemia awareness after RH. Modafinil also restores glucose sensing by PFH orexin-GI
neurons. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that RH increases the inhibitory effect of glucose on
PFH orexin-GI neurons leading to hypoglycemia unawareness. Modafinil, via the dopamine 1 receptor,
restores both glucose sensitivity of PFH orexin-GI neurons and hypoglycemia awareness. We will
determine how RH alters the glucose sensitivity of PFH orexin-GI neurons and how this is corrected by modafinil.
We will also determine the role of dopamine receptors in modafinil’s effect. Finally, we will determine the role of
diabetic hyperglycemia per se in hypoglycemia awareness/unawareness. These studies are the first to shed light
on the mechanisms of hypoglycemia awareness/unawareness and as such are of critical importance for patients
with T1/2DM."

 This K23 application supports Dr. Sheila Hegde, a highly promising cardiac imager and early-stage
investigator who is committed to investigating the underlying mechanisms by which physical activity (PA)
favorably impacts the risk of heart failure (HF) in late-life. Her long-term goal is to be an independent
investigator studying modifiable biomarkers of aging and HF risk that will ultimately inform therapeutic
intervention. The overall scientific objective of this proposal is to identify biologic pathways underlying the
beneficial effects of PA on cardiac function, functional capacity, and HF risk using high dimensional ‘-omic’
data. The main hypothesis is that PA delays age-related changes in cardiac structure and function and
mitigates HF risk through biologic pathways that can be identified through high throughput circulating
proteomic profiling. The specific aims are to: 1) Employ high-throughput plasma proteomics and genomic data
to identify novel molecular pathways underlying longitudinal PA-related changes in cardiovascular structure
and function and incident HF (NHLBI ARIC cohort); and 2) Identify molecular pathways underlying the
beneficial effect of a structured PA intervention on functional capacity with the use of plasma proteomics in
older sedentary adults at high risk of HF. (Brigham and Women’s Hospital-based cohort). These aims will also
serve as a vehicle to achieve the following career and learning objectives: 1) Attain advanced skills in novel,
data science driven methods for high-dimensional data, particularly in proteomics analysis; and 2) Develop the
necessary skills to design, implement, and conduct a clinical trial in order to transition to an independent
clinical investigator. These objectives will be accomplished through: 1) structured interactions with a
committed and expert multidisciplinary panel of mentors and advisors; 2) focused didactic coursework in study
design and statistical approaches relevant to ‘-omic’ data; and 3) progressive participation in multi-institutional
working groups and committees for national multicenter studies, dedicated mini-courses and meetings relevant
to PA and multi ‘-omic’ analyses, and national cardiovascular professional organizations. These activities will
also act as a framework to grow her leadership skills and to develop external collaborations.
 The results of the proposed early career development award will provide further insight into the
underlying cardiovascular mechanisms by which physical activity impacts age-related changes in cardiac
structure and function, functional capacity, and heart failure (HF) risk and serve as the necessary foundation
for Dr. Hegde to transition to an independent investigator."
10807642,"Project Summary
To develop effective therapies against the stress-related mental disorders (i.e., PTSD), it is highly important to
fully understand neural basis and mechanisms that underlie stress responses. The properly orchestrated
activity dynamics of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of
hypothalamus (PVH, denoted as PVHCRH neurons), the apex of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis,
are very important for underlying normal stress responses. PVHCRH neuronal activity is well known to be closely
controlled by a complex of stimulatory and inhibitory actions imposed by upstream GABAergic and
glutamatergic inputs as well as other hormonal and synaptic inputs. Despite the stress responses are well
understood at the level of PVHCRH neurons, very little is known about how stress signals are directly triggered,
buffered and regulated by upstream neurons that send direct inputs to PVHCRH neurons. Our pilot study
showed that arcuate nucleus (Arc) GABAergic neurons (denoted as ArcGABA neurons) represent one major
presynaptic GABAergic source of PVHCRH neurons (Notably, the AgRP subset of ArcGABA neurons has been
shown DO NOT sending direct inputs to PVHCRH neurons). Our preliminary tests further found that ArcGABA
neurons a) inversely regulate PVHCRH neuronal activity in a time-locked manner, b) respond in a stark contrast
phase with PVHCRH neurons but in the same phase with GABA release onto PVHCRH neurons in response to

 Sickle cell disease is a genetic red blood cell disorder affecting approximately 100,000 individuals,
primarily of African descent, in the United States alone. The presence of abnormal hemoglobin (hemoglobin S)
leads to sickling of red blood cells and vaso-occlusion, resulting in acute episodes of pain. Acute pain, or “vaso-
occlusive crisis” (VOC), is the most frequent cause of emergency room visits and hospital admissions in sickle
cell disease, contributing to the high burden of health care costs for these patients. Opioids are the mainstay of
treatment for a VOC. However, treatment with opioids runs the risk of both short and long term side effects such
as itching, constipation, respiratory depression, opioid tolerance and addiction. Because of these often severe
consequences, alternative treatment modalities to opioid therapy are urgently needed in this high-risk population.
Nitric oxide, which is generated from the amino acid citrulline through the urea cycle, is a powerful vasodilator,
and low nitric oxide levels play an important role in the pathogenesis of vaso-occlusion. Citrulline plays an
important role in nitric oxide production in endothelial cells, and consequently may be able to ameliorate vaso-
occlusion. We hypothesize that the introduction of L-citrulline to standard (opioid) therapy will shorten hospital
length of stay and decrease opioid use. In this phase 2 clinical trial, patients with sickle cell disease will be
randomized to receive either the study drug (intravenous citrulline) or placebo to determine if citrulline
administration leads to improvements in pain and decreases in hospital length of stay. In addition, we will
evaluate how the body reacts to the study medication by measuring tissue oxygenation, nitric oxide levels etc.,
while closely monitoring for side effects. To better assess how this new treatment might be tailored to meet
individual needs, DNA will be collected to evaluate the link between genetic variation in the nitric oxide pathway
and response to treatment with citrulline. The novel therapeutic option of intravenous citrulline has the potential
to significantly decrease opioid use and improve clinical outcomes for hospitalized sickle cell patients suffering
from vaso-occlusive sickle cell pain crisis."

As a neurocritical care physician, I have a strong background in neurophysiology, clinical neurology, and
critical care; as a post-graduate student who studied neuroscience, I have a background in cognitive
neuroscience. I also have a research passion for neuroscience topics such as sleep and cognition, including
how to optimize or enhance cognition. Within this K-23 proposal, I merge these clinical and research passions
and outline a thorough five-year curriculum with hands-on and didactic education to address deficiencies and
to achieve my goal of improving outcomes in older adults with acute brain injury (ABI). I have assembled a
mentorship team consisting of experts in sleep, aging, delirium, critical care, geriatric neuropsychology
(including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias; ADRD) and biostatistics. The proposed research plan
seeks to understand the impact of sleep disruption in the Neurological Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on older
patients with ABI. In current practice, the neurocritical care community performs frequent serial neurological
examinations (“neurochecks”) in an effort to monitor patients for neurological deterioration following ABI. Many
neurocritical patients are older and/or cognitively fragile, and delirium is common. Although ICU delirium is
multifaceted, frequent neurochecks may represent a modifiable risk factor if we can better understand the risks
and benefits of various neurocheck frequencies. My hypothesis is that the sleep interruption we induce in the
Neurological ICU in our patients following ABI may actually negatively impact their post-ICU recovery because
of the known associations between: 1) sleep disruption and delirium, 2) aging and delirium, 3) aging and
dementia such as ADRD, and 4) sleep and cognition. It is possible that sleep interruption during critical illness
exerts an effect on new or progressive dementia in part through delirium. In this context, this innovative,
impactful, carefully considered, and feasible proposal will first [Aim 1] randomize patients with acute
spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) to either hourly (Q1) or every-other-hour (Q2) neurochecks and
evaluate the impact of neurocheck frequency on delirium duration. Second [Aim 2], to better understand the
effect of Q1 versus Q2 on sleep, non-sedated patients without structural brain injury will be randomized to
either Q1 or Q2 neurochecks with evaluation of objective and subjective sleep characteristics. Lastly [Aim 3],
longer-term cognitive outcomes will be investigated in patients with ICH randomized to Q1 versus Q2
neurochecks with the goal of identifying whether hourly neurochecks increase the risk for dementia/ADRD. We
have designed our studies with a particular emphasis on human subjects’ protections and developed a protocol
that is well within standard of care at institutions across the USA. This grant will be instrumental to my vision as
it will provide me with the protected time for training that I require to attain first-rate patient-oriented research
skills. Ultimately, I endeavor to become an independent R01-funded neurocritical care physician scientist
focused on improving the neurocognitive health of ICU patients at risk for cognitive decline including ADRD."

10813065,"This Veterans Affairs Career Development Award (CDA-2) proposes to examine levels of neuroinflammation
and oxidative stress in the brains of Veterans with schizophrenia, and to relate these processes to each other
and to important functional outcomes. Neuroinflammation, which refers to the recruitment of immune cells in
response to injury, and the antioxidant defense system (AODS), which refers to the molecules and enzymes
that neutralize an excess of free radicals (oxidative stress), are important protective responses to injury in the
brain. Both have been shown to be altered in schizophrenia compared to healthy controls, and may be related
to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Furthermore, their relationship to disrupted functional outcomes in
schizophrenia including occupational status, housing status, and social relationships, remains relatively
unstudied. Until recently, markers for neuroinflammation and the AODS have only been examined in
postmortem tissue, peripheral blood, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients. This CDA-2 proposes to
examine both neuroinflammation and the AODS directly in brain of Veterans with schizophrenia and control
subjects with two relatively novel techniques: 1) neuroinflammation will be measured with second-generation
radioligand binding to the molecule translocator protein (TSPO), using positron emission tomography (PET);
subjects will be genotyped in order to exclude the low affinity binding phenotype prior to entering the study, and
2) the AODS will be measured with levels of glutathione, the most important antioxidant molecule in the brain,
using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The specific area of focus will be dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex in light of this area’s importance for cognitive function in schizophrenia. The project has three scientific
goals: a) Brain levels of neuroinflammation and the AODS will be compared between patients with
schizophrenia and healthy controls. b) The relationship of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress to each
other in patients will be examined, along with their relationship to cognitive performance and community
function via clinical assessments and interviews. c) The peripheral inflammatory markers TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10,
INF-g and CRP will be measured, and their relationship to the above central markers will be examined. This
information will shed light on the roles of two key processes in the brain in schizophrenia, and their influence
on quality of life for Veterans with schizophrenia. In addition to these scientific aims, this proposal will provide
the applicant, Dr. Yvonne Yang, with expertise in PET neuroimaging and MRS neuroimaging, and expertise in
the field of neuroinflammation in schizophrenia. Dr. Yang’s training plan includes regular meetings with her
mentors: expert in PET neuroimaging Dr. Mark Mandelkern, MRS physicist Dr. Albert Thomas, psychiatrist and
expert in MRS of glutathione Dr. Richard Maddock, expert in psychoneuroimmunology Dr. Michael Irwin, and
her primary mentor Dr. Michael Green. It also includes workshops, conferences, formal didactics, and training
in the responsible conduct of research. The scientific project, training plan, and mentoring plan described
above will provide Dr. Yang with the skills and expertise to independently lead further studies investigating the
role of neuroinflammation in schizophrenia, and lay the groundwork for a personalized medicine treatment
paradigm using anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents, through a VA Merit Award proposal."
10813066,"Project summary
The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small nucleus in the brainstem that is vulnerable to the accumulation of abnormal
tau protein, a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The LC is structurally connected to the
temporal lobe and may play a role in transmitting abnormal tau through trans-neuronal spread. The LC is the
primary producer of the neuromodulator norepinephrine. Norepinephrine is essential for normal attention and
memory function. Beyond a role in cognition, norepinephrine serves a myriad of neuroprotective roles which
include inhibition of oxidative stress, maintenance of the blood brain barrier, and anti-inflammatory processes.
The occurrence of hyperphosphorylated tau in the LC has been linked with loss of norepinephrine-producing
LC neurons. The targeting and neurodegeneration of LC is particularly insidious due to the combined loss of
cognition-enhancing neuromodulation and loss of neuroprotective functions thus paving the way for disease
acceleration and propagation. Despite insults to the LC, there is evidence for upregulation of norepinephrine
metabolism in healthy aging, mild cognitive impairment, and AD. We propose upregulation of norepinephrine
synthesis in the LC cells remaining represents a mechanism of neurochemical compensation that, in some
individuals, wards off cognitive decline and protects against disease spread. In healthy older adult humans, we
will define relationships between LC structural integrity, and norepinephrine synthesis levels (Aim 1). We will
determine the extent to which elevated norepinephrine synthesis confers a benefit to memory performance
(Aim 2). Finally, we will test the hypothesis that elevated norepinephrine synthesis is associated with reduced
tau accumulation longitudinally (Aim 3). This multimodal study will combine state-of-the-art magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) to measure LC structural integrity, [18F]Fluoro-m-tyrosine positron emission
tomography (PET) to measure norepinephrine/dopamine synthesis capacity, [18F]MK-6240 PET to measure
tau pathology, and plasma measures of Ab42/40. If successful, this research will provide new understanding of
the neurochemical basis of individual differences in disease progression and will launch a novel avenue of
investigation into the role of norepinephrine in disease resilience (supporting maintenance of cognitive function
despite pathology) and disease resistance (combatting disease spread)."
10813069,"My laboratory is interested in fundamental molecular mechanisms by which cells maintain ionic homeostasis.
We study two particular systems responsible for transport of K+ and Zn2+, respectively. Overall goals are the
same for both systems, which are to develop a comprehensive understanding of transport from structural as
well as thermodynamic perspectives. We will use a broad spectrum of biophysical and biochemical
approaches, including cryo-EM for structure determination, in vitro biophysical assays for functional
characterization, single-molecule FRET and Molecular Dynamic simulations for analyzing dynamics of the
molecules. In this way, we aim to define an energy landscape for each system, annotated with the
experimental structures for stable intermediates as well as an appreciation for the high-energy transition states
that define the transport pathway. We also seek to understand determinants of substrate specificity and
structural elements responsible for the allosteric coupling that underlies energy coupling and regulatory
mechanisms. The first system under investigation is KdpFABC, an interesting and unusual hybrid between an
ATP-dependent pump related to P-type ATPases and a K+ channel related to the Superfamily of K+
Transporters. Our previous work has defined the architecture of this heterotetramer and suggests a highly
novel mechanism for transport, in which K+ enters the selectivity filter of the channel-like subunit, travels 40 Å
through a membrane-embedded tunnel, and is then expelled by the pump-like subunit in an energy-dependent
manner. We now plan functional analyses of site-directed mutants to validate this hypothesis and to adopt new
approaches to study the energetics. The second system is YiiP, a Zn2+/H+ antiporter from the Cation Diffusion
Facilitator superfamily. Members of this family form homodimers, have multiple ion binding sites and are
thought to function via an alternating access mechanism. For this system, we have characterized two different
conformations by cryo-EM analysis and MD simulation, and have identified a role for Zn2+ binding on the
transition. We seek to understand better the role of individual Zn2+ binding sites, the nature of occluded states,
the transition between inward- and outward-facing states and the role of protons in this process. We plan also
to study additional members of this family to address the basis for substrate specificity and structural features
that have been postulated to regulate the transport process. In addition to shedding light on these two specific
transport mechanisms, we hope that our work will offer new ways to think about transport that goes beyond
cartoons and structural animations to incorporate protein dynamics and mapping of the energy landscape to
describe the behavior of these molecular machines."

The goal of this R01 renewal is to examine the impact of methamphetamine (MA) use on fatal and nonfatal
overdose, engagement in injection- and sex-risk behaviors, and treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) and
other substance use disorders (SUD) among people who use drugs (PWUD) from two Appalachian cohorts.
MA use among people who use opioids is increasing. Several recent publications have coined this increase in
MA/opioid co-usage as the “twin epidemics”, as new onset methamphetamine use has been reported in areas
particularly hard hit by the opioid epidemic. This application builds on work from two established cohort studies
located in the epicenter of the opioid crisis - the Social Networks Among Appalachian People (SNAP) cohort
and GATEWAY2HOPE (G2H). These cohorts will be combined to increase both geographic scope and
statistical power and to examine the following aims: 1) To characterize use of methamphetamine in the context
of continued opioid use (twin epidemics), initiation of meth use, and social networks of PWUM. Building on the
data we have gathered for opioid use over time, additional prospective data will be collected on initiation and
use patterns for methamphetamine, including route of administration; 2) To examine longitudinal changes in
sex- and injection-risk behaviors as a result of initiation of meth use. Measures specific to this aim include fatal
and non-fatal overdose, sharing of syringe and other injection paraphernalia, and unprotected sexual
encounters. HIV, HCV and STI testing, as well as death certificate reviews will be conducted to complement
self-reported behavioral data; and 3) determine impact of MA use on SUD/OUD treatment seeking, treatment
initiation and long-term engagement in SUD treatment. While the data collected to date from the SNAP and
CARE2HOPE cohorts have been invaluable in informing the opioid epidemic in rural Appalachia, it is important
that this renewal be positioned to fill additional gaps in the literature. Currently, there is little information on the
“twin epidemic” phenomenon and its potential impact on fatal and non-fatal overdoses, the SUD treatment
cascade, and harm reduction services, especially in resource-deprived areas such as rural Appalachia. The
proposed renewal will address these gaps and provide data that are integral to addressing drug-related harms
in the rural U.S."

Non-syndromic orofacial clefts are one of the most common birth defects worldwide. Genetic variation is
thought to play a major role in risk of non-syndromic clefts; indeed, several genetic risk loci have been
identified, to date. However, these loci cumulatively explain only part of the heritability, and for most of these
loci, the specific causal variants have not yet been determined. Moreover, recent work has suggested that cleft
subtypes (i.e., cleft lip alone, cleft lip with cleft palate, cleft palate alone, and subtypes defined by laterality and
completeness) may have partially overlapping and partially distinct etiologies, although the shared and
unshared genetic architectures of cleft subtypes are not well understood. Furthermore, maternal environmental
exposures (i.e., smoking, alcohol consumption, and folate) during pregnancy are known to influence cleft risk
and may interact with genetic factors as part of the underlying cleft liability. This proposal will seek to fill the
gap in knowledge regarding the genetic variants and their interactions with maternal exposures leading to overt
forms of clefts. This project will include analyses of existing data on our previously collected cohort comprising
cases with orofacial clefts, their immediate family members, and controls with no history of clefts. We will use
these data to perform genome-wide association studies and targeted gene-by-environmental interaction
analyses for orofacial clefts and subtypes. Understanding the genetic architecture of orofacial clefts may
ultimately lead to improved prediction of risk and recurrence, and may inform new preventive or therapeutic
interventions."

The overall goal of this research is to better understand how astrocytes in the medial subnucleus of the
central amygdala (CeM) modulate conditioned fear behaviors. We recently found using brain slices that
exogenous activation of astrocytes in the CeM powerfully regulates synaptic transmission and decreases
CeM neuronal activity. However, critical gaps remain in identifying the role of CeM astrocytes in vivo,
their contribution during fear conditioned behaviors, and the neurochemical pathways that couple the
concerted activity of neuronal and astrocyte networks in the CeM. The goal of this proposal is therefore
to address these gaps in knowledge by performing measurements of astrocytic and neuronal activity in
the amygdala in freely, behaving mice using optical and genetic methods. In Aim1 we will record the
activity of astrocytes in the CeM during the acquisition, expression and extinction of cued fear
conditioned behaviors. They will provide the first physiological evidence that astrocytes are specifically
and differentially activated during specific phases of conditioned fear responses. In Aim 2 we will
determine whether CeM astrocytes have an endogenous role in modulating amygdala-driven responses.
It will also further test the role of astrocytic endocannabinoid signaling in these behaviors. In Aim 3 we
will determine the cellular and behavioral consequences upon exogenous activation of CeM astrocytes
using chemogenetic and optogenetic methods. In summary, the proposed studies will provide a much
more detailed picture on the role of astrocytes in the central amygdala and extend our recent ex vivo
amygdala slice studies. This knowledge will pave the way for new pharmacological strategies to treat
anxiety/fear disorders, by taking advantage of the uncommon profile of receptor expression of astrocytes
to regulate their activity. Therefore, our studies will contribute to generate a new strategy to treat
neurological diseases, such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress syndrome by targeting a relatively
understudied cell type in the amygdala."

 Kidneys, as a major organ for waste removal, are being exploited to accelerate the body
clearance of “off-target” engineered nanoparticles to meet FDA regulation for the clinical translation of
nanomedicines, which demands thorough understanding of nanoparticle transport and interactions at
the fundamental level. However, renal proximal tubule is often overlooked in comparison with
extensive studies on glomerular filtration of engineered nanoparticles even though proximal tubule is
the most active site involved in concentration, retention and reabsorption of the filtered proteins
through glomeruli. While the sizes and charges are recognized important in protein reabsorption due
to unique microvilli-covered surface of proximal tubule cells, it is still largely unknown how engineered
nanoparticles will be retained and interact with the proximal tubules after being filtered through the
glomeruli.
 The objective of this application is to advance our fundamental understanding of the size,
charge and surface chemistry effects on the transport and interactions of engineered nanoparticles in
not only the normal but also injured proximal tubules; so that we can obtain a general strategy in
minimizing their potential health hazards in their future clinical applications. Five specific aims are
proposed to accomplish the objective: In Aims 1-3, we will unravel size, surface chemistry, and
surface charge effects on the transport and interaction of renal clearable gold nanoparticle in renal
proximal tubules. Aim 4 is to revisit these size, charge and surface chemistry dependencies in the
diseased kidneys with proximal tubular injury. Aim 5 is to evaluate biocompatibility and nephrotoxicity
of renal clearable AuNPs with distinct interactions with proximal tubules in both normal mice and mice
with proximal tubular injury. Success of the proposed studies will significantly advance our
fundamental understanding of in vivo interactions of engineered nanoparticles with renal proximal
tubules, laying down a solid foundation for further development of new design strategies that can
minimize nephrotoxicity of nanomedicines in their future clinical translation."

orexin system activity to deficits in fear extinction.17–20 Our group has demonstrated that reactivity to CO2
challenge, which is a safe, affordable and easy-to-implement procedure, can serve as a proxy for orexin
system activity and predicts fear extinction deficits in rodents.21
Building upon this basic research, the goal for the propo
sed study is to validate CO2 reactivity as a
biomarker of exposure-based therapy non-response.
To this end, we will assess
CO2 reactivity in
600 adults
meeting for one or more fear- or anxiety-related disorders prior to providing open, state-of-the art,
transdiagnostic exposure-based therapy. By incorporating CO2 reactivity into a multivariate model predicting
treatment non-response that also includes reactivity to hyperventilation as well as a number of related and
theoretically-relevant prognostic variables, we will establish the mechanistic specificity and the additive
predictive value of the putative biomarker. By developing models independently within two study sites and
predicting the other site's data, we will validate that the results are likely to generalize to future clinical
samples.
 The proposed study represents a necessary stage in translating basic research to strategies for treatment
selection. The investigation addresses an important public health issue by testing an accessible clinical
assessment strategy - informed by basic research - that may lead to a more effective treatment selection
(personalized medicine) for patients with anxiety- and fear-related disorders and enhance our understanding of
the mechanisms governing exposure-based therapy."
10814174,"The goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity of neural
circuits essential for learning and memory. We focus on class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs), transcriptional
repressors that shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. We and our colleagues have previously
demonstrated that the class IIa HDAC isoform, HDAC4, regulates memory in mice, drosophila and C.elegans.
In conjunction with these findings, HDAC4 has been linked to several neurological disorders in humans. In the
initial project period, we discovered that HDAC4 and its close homolog, HDAC5, restrict the transcriptional
response to sensory input. These observations support the hypothesis that plasticity- and memory-related genes
are dynamically repressed in the brain in any environment. Here, we propose to determine how class IIa HDACs
operate at circuit, cellular and molecular levels, and how their nuclear signaling impacts neurons in the mouse
hippocampus. Moreover, we will exploit class II HDACs as tools for rapid chemical-genetic control of transcription
in behaving animals.
Our aims are: 1) To determine how class IIa HDAC operate at a circuit level by using immunofluorescent
microscopy, activity-based tagging of memory engrams cells, and in vivo 2-photon imaging of repressors and
calcium indicators; 2) To identify nuclear effectors of class IIa HDACs in specific genetically-defined neuron types
by deep sequencing and mass spectrometry; 3) To define the consequences of class IIa HDACs signaling on
circuit structure and function. This will be accomplished by combining electron microscopy, whole-brain imaging,
and electrophysiology; and 4) To leverage chemical-genetic manipulation of class IIa HDAC signaling for
mapping of brain areas where activity-dependent transcription promotes memory coding.
Taken together, these studies will explain how neuronal chromatin-binding proteins associated with human
disease function in the normal brain, and will provide novel insights into the basic mechanisms underlying
network plasticity and memory storage."
10814254,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The gut microbiome makes significant contributions to whole-body glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, in
part, through production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA). Recent evidence suggests that microbial SCFA
production may be increased by exercise training, and that SCFA may be important positive regulators of
exercise performance and skeletal muscle metabolism and function. However, it is not known how gut microbes
could regulate SCFA production in response to exercise. Our work identifies lactate utilizing bacteria (LU-Bac),
which can convert lactate to SCFA, as potential sources of SCFA during exercise. As circulating lactate levels
increase during moderate to high intensity exercise, combining LU-Bac supplementation with exercise may result
in higher levels of circulating SCFA, thus enhancing the metabolic benefits of exercise. Individuals with impaired
glucose tolerance have lower gut LU-Bac content, and blunted metabolic and aerobic improvements in response
to exercise training. Thus, in addition to improving metabolic health, LU-Bac supplementation may enhance the
health benefits of exercise by ameliorating the metabolic defects that lead to impaired training response. We
hypothesize that lactate produced by muscle with regular exercise is used by LU-Bac to generate SCFA, which
then act on skeletal muscle to improve metabolism and function. We propose this novel gut-muscle axis leads
to improved metabolic health and exercise response. One aim of this proposal is to test LU-Bac supplementation
as a treatment for impaired glucose tolerance and low response to exercise in mouse models of metabolic
disease that partially reflect the pathologies of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. A second aim is to determine the
specific contribution of lactate fermentation by LU-Bac to circulating and tissue SCFA levels with exercise, and
whether LU-Bac-derived SCFA contribute to the health benefits of exercise training. Our third aim is to define
the mechanisms in skeletal muscle by which SCFA lead to enhanced exercise performance and metabolic
health. Specifically, we will determine whether SCFA receptors and transporters in muscle are necessary for
the positive effects of SCFA on muscle metabolism and function. This work will have a broad impact on the
fields of exercise, metabolism, and microbiology by determining the mechanisms by which the microbiome can
enhance muscle metabolism and adaptation to exercise. We anticipate our results will lead to development of a
live biotherapeutic to improve exercise response and metabolic health."

Developing a small molecule male contraceptive is complicated by the blood-testis barrier (BTB) and blood-
epididymal barrier (BEB), since many male contraceptive targets are localized to the adluminal compartment of
the seminiferous epithelium or to sperm within the epididymal tubule lumen. Improved understanding of the
chemical features that confer the ability for xenobiotics to cross BTB or BEB will facilitate the discovery and
development of new male contraceptives. Published data and our studies of novel bromodomain testis (BRDT)
inhibitors suggest that it is possible to identify properties that facilitate passage across the BTB or BEB. We will
identify key chemical features that facilitate the passage of drugs across BTB and BEB in two separate R61
and R33 phases. In the R61 phase, we will 1) optimize the protocols and throughput for measuring mouse
tissue distribution using a drug test set; and 2) measure tissue distribution of 100 compounds and their
metabolites and identify molecular descriptors that influence delivery to the testis. We will quantify chemically
unrelated compounds in mouse plasma, rete testis fluid (RTF), testis, and epididymis using liquid
chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Compound spatial distribution in the rete testis, testis, and
epididymis will be mapped using imaging MS. We will use chemoinformatics to correlate structures and
molecular descriptors with the experimental RTF/plasma, testis/plasma, and epididymis/plasma ratios to
identify features that facilitate or impede testis accumulation. In the R33 phase we plan to broaden our
understanding and directly test the effects of altering the key inferred physical properties or molecular
descriptors. We will 3) validate identified chemical features using a series of rationally designed synthetic
analogs. Analyzing compound series will allow us to distinguish between trends in physicochemical parameters
and special properties conferred by a particular chemotype. We will 4) test an additional 200 novel small
molecules to identify new chemotypes that influence testis uptake and 5) test outlier compounds whose uptake
belies their physical properties using transporter knock-out mice, to determine the tissue distribution that
occurs without transporters so as to improve our physicochemical permeability models for the BTB and BEB.
This work will establish predictive uptake rules applicable to drugs that must act behind BTB or BEB, facilitating
the identification of new male contraceptives and of therapeutics for which accumulation in the immune-
privileged compartments of the testis or epididymis would be beneficial."

Photoactivatable Fluorophores for High-Throughput Multiplexed Tracking of Single-Molecules in Live Cells
PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The goal of our project is to develop synthetic dyes with photoactivatable fluorescence for the simultaneous
tracking of multiple structurally-distinct intracellular components in live cells. Specifically, the proposed studies
will lead to the realization of a palette of photoactivatable fluorophores (PAFs) that can be photoactivated with
mild green illumination (>500 nm) to produce partially-resolved fluorescence across the red region (>600 nm) of
the electromagnetic spectrum. Their photoactivation conditions will ensure negligible photodamage to live cells,
which instead cannot be avoided under the harsh irradiation required to operate existing PAFs. The high
brightness, infinite contrast and high photobleaching resistance engineered into our PAFs will enable the
localization of individual photoactivated molecules with precision at the nanometer level (≤20 nm) and their
tracking with millisecond response (≤10 ms) for several seconds (≥1 s) on the basis of single-particle tracking
photoactivated localization microscopy (spt-PALM). Their spectrally-resolved fluorescence will permit the
identification of structurally-distinct probes with the acquisition of emission spectra at the single-molecule level,
relying on spectroscopic single-molecule localization microscopy (sSMLM). Such a unique combination of
photochemical and photophysical properties is unprecedented and, in conjunction with established strategies to
label selectively different intracellular components of live cells with synthetic dyes, will allow the simultaneous
monitoring of multiple structurally-distinct targets with the characteristic high-throughput of spt-PALM and
spectral discrimination of sSMLM. The spatial resolution possible with our technology cannot be achieved with
conventional fluorescence imaging protocols and its high-throughput multiplexing capabilities cannot be
implemented in live cells with the many synthetic dyes and fluorescent proteins developed so far. Thus, the
innovative synthetic constructs that will emerge from the proposed studies can contribute to the investigation of
the fundamental factors governing cellular processes with multiplexing and super-resolution capabilities that are
not accessible with current fluorescent probes and imaging schemes."

Stroke is a highly prevalent condition that contributes to significant deficits in functional mobility, particularly in
older adults. To address these deficits, post-acute rehabilitation is an evidence-based component of care.
However, facility-based rehabilitation (i.e., in a skilled nursing or inpatient rehabilitation facility) is costly. If
stroke patients can achieve the same outcomes in a high-intensity home-based rehabilitation (HIHR) approach
as in these facilities, the relative value (outcomes/costs) would be greater. The effectiveness of such an
approach has not been studied. Further, the implementation of a HIHR care model has not been examined in
the US health system. The objectives of the proposed research are to identify barriers to initial HIHR efforts
implementation in one health system and to understand its clinical effectiveness to inform subsequent
improvement of the care model. A hybrid type 2 study design with a triangulated mixed methods approach will
be used over two cycles of a learning health system research framework. Specific aims are to (1) explore
barriers affecting the initial implementation of HIHR for stroke patients, (2) compare the effectiveness of HIHR
to facility-based rehabilitation on improving patients' function, and (3) implement a refined HIHR model and re-
examine its implementation and effectiveness. We hypothesize that clinical workflow challenges and
patient/caregiver preferences will affect the outcomes with initial implementation and that patients' function at
HIHR discharge will be at least equivalent to patients' function at facility discharge. We also hypothesize that
improvements in implementation and effectiveness outcomes will be achieved by refining the HIHR model after
learning from the evaluation of the initial model. These aims align well with the candidate's goal to become an
independent learning health system researcher, with an emphasis on studying rehabilitation practice in health
systems. Training aims are to (1) develop expertise in mixed methods research and its application to care
delivery, (2) gain expertise in assessing implementation success of a health system innovation, (3) develop
expertise in comparative effectiveness research using observational data, and (4) develop skills to engage with
health system leaders and lead a learning health system research lab. These training aims will be
accomplished via one-on-one mentorship with content experts and combination of local and national
coursework. All scientific and training aims will be accomplished in an environment that includes a large
integrated academic health system and a partner institution for didactic instruction. The expected outcome of
this work is a description of the implementation and effectiveness outcomes for HIHR. This is an innovative
approach for post-acute rehabilitation following stroke that does not currently exist in the US health system, but
which may substantially affect the value of care that aims to improve patients' functional independence
following stroke."
10814317,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Young Adults (YA) are a key “super-spreader” population transmitting SARS-Co-V2, the causative agent of
COVID-19 (COVID). Given their high rate of asymptomatic infection compounded by transmission rates that
are being fueled by behaviors that run contrary to physical distancing and face covering regulations, YA
represent a priority population upon which to focus efforts to ensure high levels of COVID vaccine uptake.
While COVID vaccines can protect African American young adults (AA-YA) against COVID related morbidity
and mortality, this population will only accept vaccination if interventions assure AA-YA of its safety and
benefit, while also addressing historical contexts and systemic forces that propagate mistrust. Digital Health
Interventions (DHIs) can reach large numbers of AA-YA regardless of geographic location and empower them
to make informed decisions about their health using a familiar modality that YAs value and trust. Our
collaborative team developed the theory informed DHI Tough Talks to assist YA with HIV disclosure decision
making, specifically by considering the social, ethical and behavioral implications of their choices and the
consequences that follow. In response to NOT-MD-21-008: Research to Address Vaccine Hesitancy, Uptake,
and Implementation among Populations that Experience Health Disparities, we propose to apply a community-
based participatory research (CBPR) approach to assess multi-level factors identified within the NIMHD
Research Framework and adapt and test Tough Talks to address COVID vaccine hesitancy (VH), Tough
Talks-COVID (TT-C). In aim 1, we will conduct multi-method formative research to elicit the behavioral,
cognitive, and environmental determinants influencing COVID VH among AA-YA (ages 18-29) in three
southern states. We combine validated survey measures, with novel CBPR methods including choose-your-
own adventure journeys and digital storytelling to better understand vaccine decision-making in AA-YA. In
collaboration with expert advisors, community partners, and AA-YA end-users, in aim 2, we will leverage
ADAPT-ITT to develop and refine TT-C. User-centered participatory design and rapid prototyping focus groups
will be conducted with AA-YA (n=12-16) in southern states. Once finalized, we will conduct a technical pilot
with AA-YA (N=24) to assess TT-C’s feasibility and acceptability. In aim 3, we will conduct a hybrid type 1
effectiveness implementation 3-arm RCT with n=540 AA-YA from three southern states. Participants will be
randomized to receive standard of care (control), TT-C delivered remotely, and TT-C delivered in-person.
Primary effectiveness outcomes are COVID vaccine uptake and series completion. Secondary effectiveness
outcomes are VH, confidence, and knowledge, attitudes and beliefs. We will conduct qualitative interviews with
participants (n=12-16) and site staff (n=6-8) to assess implementation barriers and facilitators. We leverage our
existing infrastructure to meaningfully engage with southern AA-YA communities, working to dismantle
inequitable research relationships and medical mistrust to increase COVID vaccine uptake."
10814181,"Project Summary
 Damage to salivary glands is a devastating condition – identification of therapies to
promote regeneration of these important organs is imperative. Great progress is being made in
engineering and transplantation of salivary gland epithelium. A major remaining hurdle in
gland engineering is the need to establish a functional vasculature, which is essential for survival
of any replacement tissue in vivo. In addition to essential support, therapeutic angiogenesis also
stimulates healing of non-vascular tissue. This study will characterize methods of promoting
vascularization in regenerating salivary gland tissues. Using mice as a pre-clinical model system,
we will evaluate two distinct therapeutic approaches – individually and in combination – to
promote vascularization and regeneration of damaged glands. One therapeutic approach
involves implantation of an exogenous vascular cell milieu as a method to enhance formation of
functional blood vessel networks. The other approach, which may be effective when used in
conjunction with implanted cells, or on its own, will involve systemic delivery of a drug with
potential to stimulate angiogenesis. The therapeutic potentials of the of the two approaches will
be evaluated separately and in combination in vivo in mice in a biopsy wound healing model.
Cellular and molecular events of vascular assembly associated with each therapy will be defined
using cell culture assays in vitro. For implantation of vascular cells, we will use a cell milieu of
stromal vascular fraction derived from adipose (AdSVF). The AdSVF cell milieu has real
advantages as a cell source. It includes many cell types needed to form functional blood vessel
networks (endothelial, pericytes, vascular smooth muscle, fibroblasts) it reduces inflammation
to promote regeneration of parenchymal tissue, it is readily available for self-donation, and,
importantly, has proven safe for clinical use. As an adjunct to implanted AdSVF, or as a
stand-alone vascularizing therapeutic, we will also test the ability of a systemic pharmacologic
agent Tazarotene to stimulate formation of functional vascular networks. Tazarotene is a
synthetic retinoid. Its vascular promoting activity is consistent with the action of natural
retinoids, including vitamin A and its derivative retinoic acid, which are essential for vascular
assembly in vivo. This project will identify methods to promote functional vasculature in
regenerating salivary glands. Resulting knowledge can be used to enhance success of therapies
aimed at repairing salivary epithelium, thereby advancing the field toward developing effective
therapies for patients suffering from salivary gland damage."
10814403,"There is an urgent need to decipher the complex polygenic risk architecture of neuropsychiatric and
neurodevelopmental disorders. Most disease-associated common variants are non-coding. Candidate risk loci
in noncoding regions are often regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters, that may modulate
transcriptional activity of key genes contributing to one or many endophenotypes. The functional impact of
most disease-associated non-coding variants remains unknown. Enhancers are known to underlie cell-type
specific patterning of gene expression influencing cellular development and responses to environmental
conditions. Candidate regulatory sequences (CRS) associated with genetic risk are likely key drivers of
underlying endophenotypes and represent potential therapeutic targets. Over the past decade, large-scale
identification of regulatory sequences has expanded our awareness and highlighted their importance yet
functional characterization of regulatory elements on a meaningful scale remained inaccessible. Only with
contemporary advances in high-throughput sequencing and large-scale screening techniques, such as the
Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA), has characterizing the growing list of non-coding risk loci en
masse become feasible. I will apply a MPRA in hiPSC-derived brain cells to identify psychiatric risk variants
within CRS that demonstrate cell-type specific transcriptional activity. Additionally, I wi/1 lool< at the interactions
ol pre-natal stress and inflammation with genetic risl< and consequent susceptibility to negative mental health
later in life. There is sufficient evidence correlating fetal environmental factors with neurodevelopmental
trajectories. Stress or inflammation during pregnancy has been linked to mental health outcomes in the
offspring. The influence of pre-natal environmental factors on brain-related CRSs may explain correlations with
Maternal-Immune Activation (MIA) and increased susceptibility to stress and negative health trajectories of the
offspring. Biological mechanisms underlying MIA may contribute to this increased susceptibility. Using MPRAs,
I will identify risk variants within brain-related CRS that confer greater susceptibility, or resilience, to
environmental stressors. By assessing environmental interactions during development, we will look at
contributions to risk that precede later-life traumatic experiences or symptom presentations. This research will
take place under the Mount Sinai Neuroscience Training Program. Mount Sinai's Department of Neuroscience
currently ranks 2nd nationally in NIH funding. Nearly 5,000 ft2 of space are allocated to the Training Program
within the Neuroscience Department and Friedman Brain Institute. There is, additionally, ~100,000 ft2 that
house the Department's and the lnstitute's research programs and 4,500 ft2 dedicated to Institutional CORE
facilities. This fellowship would support my journey to become a multidisciplinary, translational principal
investigator by providing training in four major areas: Scientific Excellence. Scientific Alliance. Academic
Scholarship. and Scientific Leadership."
10812630,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 2 inflammation occurs during intestinal helminth parasite infection and allergic disease, which together
affect billions of people worldwide and cause significant morbidity. Hookworm-like parasites migrate through
the lung and then reside in the gut, providing a valuable model to study Type 2 inflammation in multiple tissues.
The current paradigm suggests that Type 2 inflammation is characterized by epithelial cell production of
interleukin (IL)-33 that activates immune cells to produce IL-4 and IL-13, which act back on epithelial cells to
promote mucin secretion and worm expulsion. In parallel, synthesis of the bioactive lipid prostaglandin D2
(PGD2) is increased and expression of its receptor CRTH2 is also dynamically regulated on immune and
epithelial cells. However, our current cytokine-centric paradigm does not adequately account for how PGD2
and CRTH2 control cell- and tissue-specific responses in Type 2 inflammation. Our preliminary studies
leverage a novel CRTH2 reporter mouse that also allows for cell lineage-restricted CRTH2 deletion, revealing
CRTH2 expression in group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). We show that
ILC2s, critical IL-13-producers, failed to accumulate in the lung during Type 2 inflammation in CRTH2-deficient
mice, likely due to effects on ILC2 migration. In contrast, PGD2 counteracted the effects of IL-13 on CRTH2-
expressing IECs during intestinal helminth infection. Intestinal tuft cells, epithelial cells that produce anti-
helminth IL-25 and leukotrienes, were particularly enriched for CRTH2 expression, and surprisingly, were
capable of PGD2 production. These data led us to hypothesize that cell type- and tissue-specific signals control
CRTH2 expression in the lung vs. intestine to dictate the context-dependent effects of PGD2 during Type 2
inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we propose 2 Specific Aims that will employ murine models of
hookworm-like parasite infection and in vitro murine and human small intestine enteroid cultures. Aim 1 will
dissect the role of IL-33 in upregulating ILC2 CRTH2 expression and mechanisms by which the PGD2-CRTH2
pathway controls ILC2 tissue distribution and activation in pulmonary Type 2 inflammation. Aim 2 will test if IL-
13 promotes tuft cell CRTH2 upregulation, how the PGD2-CRTH2 pathway regulates pro-inflammatory cytokine
and leukotriene release from murine and human tuft cells, how tuft cell-intrinsic CRTH2 regulates protection
against helminth infection, and if tuft cells are a critical source of PGD2 in the intestine. These studies will
reveal how PGD2 and CRTH2 control Type 2 inflammation. Trials employing CRTH2 inhibitors to treat allergic
respiratory disease in humans have yielded conflicting results, potentially attributable to unappreciated effects
of CRTH2 on a variety of immune and epithelial cell types. Thus, our studies stand to inform the strategic use
of CRTH2 inhibitors in the modulation of lung and intestinal Type 2 inflammation in humans."

The community of microorganisms within our gastrointestinal tract, collectively known as the gut microbiota,
constitutes one of the densest and most diverse bacterial ecosystems known. While the close relationship
between humans and their microbiota represents vast potential for engineering human health, we are currently
limited in tools required to unravel the intrinsic complexity. Our ability to predictably harness the microbiota for
beneficial health outcomes requires a fundamental understanding of the physiology of these bacteria, yet most
human gut bacteria have never been studied using molecular genetic tools and are too distantly related from
well-studied model bacteria to accurately transfer gene annotations by homology. This major gap in our
functional understanding of gene functions in human gut bacteria must be addressed with systematic efforts,
which will require multiple complementary expertise.
 High-throughput genetics is an attractive approach for characterizing the biological functions of genes
within the human microbiota. Application of perturbations en masse to large populations of genetically modified
bacteria permits the parallel assessment of nearly all genes. A similar high-throughput strategy can potentially
be applied to the human gut microbiome, but there are multiple major obstacles that we aim to resolve in this
project: (1) transformation of non-model bacteria remains challenging and is a largely trial-by-error effort, (2)
the development of a new genetic system for a non-model bacterium is time-consuming, (3) the adoption of
multiple technologies and laboratory workflows complicates the comparison of data across teams, (4) in vivo
mouse experiments should ideally be carried out in ex-germ-free mice colonized by mutants of interest.
 The team assembled for this grant includes leaders at the forefront of novel cultivation methods,
electroporation for genetic transformation, and tools for assessing gene function in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 1,
we will rapidly develop genetic tools for a large number of human gut commensal strains, with the ultimate goal
of generating genome-wide randomly barcoded transposon mutant libraries for sequencing. We will utilize
these libraries to test the phenotypic importance of all non-essential genes across a multitude of in vitro (Aim 2)
and in vivo (Aim 3) conditions to globally discover new gene functions. Through our combined expertise in
bacteriology, microfluidics, high-throughput screening, host-microbe interactions, and imaging, we will produce
genetic tools and fitness data for the vast community of microbiota researchers at unprecedented scale, and
deliver deep insight into the physiology of the human gut microbiota."

Robust model systems are essential for understanding human disease. While Alzheimer’s disease can be studied using in vivo models that have become more representative in recent years (e.g. by introducing natural genetic diversity and humanized APOE variants into existing Alzheimer’s mouse models), the ability to study vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) remains difficult. Indeed, the molecular mechanisms underlying VCID and SVD remain mostly unknown, and in vivo models for these diseases are lacking. A representative human in vitro model would therefore be beneficial to complement in vivo systems and improve understanding of vascular contributions to neurodegeneration. The development of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has increased the utility of in vitro central nervous system (CNS) models, which have gradually progressed from isolated two-dimensional cell cultures to multi-cellular three-dimensional assemblies that better recapitulate the organization and architecture of specific brain regions. However, these human ‘brain organoids’ still have significant deficits. Notably, cortical organoids exhibit improperly organized laminar architectures and lack perfusable microvasculature with blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. These deficits limit the representativeness of using brain organoids to understand the mechanisms of VCID and SVD. In this proposed project, we will develop a biomimetic brain organoid platform with robust neurovascular function. Aim 1 of this proposal will characterize the organization and maturation of cortica. organoids grown in a novel biomaterial that mimics cues provided by radial glia to help guide laminar patterning. Aim 2 will focus on integrating brain endothelial cells and pericytes with the cortical organoids to develop perfusable microvasculature throughout the tissue construct, thereby generating the ‘neurovascular organoid’ platform. Aim 3 will then validate the representativeness of the neurovascular organoids by subjecting them to acute and chronic injuries known to damage the BBB; in particular, iPSCs with defined APOE genotype will be used to assess onset and progression of neurovascular dysfunction in response to this well-established genetic risk factor. Overall, this project will establish a human in vitro model of the vascularized cortex that is expected to have utility for unraveling the mechanisms of VCID and SVD."

A treatment for drug addiction remains elusive due to incomplete knowledge of the brain
circuits controlling both the overwhelming motivation to relapse to drug use and the ability to
refrain from using drugs. In part through progress during the 20-yr tenure of this grant, we
know that glutamatergic projections from cortical and allocortical brain regions to the nucleus
accumbens core (NAcore) and GABAergic NAcore projections to the dorsolateral ventral
pallidum (dlVP) are necessary for executing cue-induced cocaine seeking and extinction
training-induced refraining from cocaine seeking. Classically, projections from the striatum
contain two neuronal subtypes, those projecting to the ventral mesencephalon selectively
expressing D1 dopamine receptors (D1-MSNs) and those projecting to the palldum expressing
D2 receptors (D2-MSNs). Through work on this grant, we now know that NAcore D1-MSNs also
innervate the dlVP1, and that activity in this D1-MSN to dlVP subcircuit is necessary for cue-
induced cocaine seeking. Also, we discovered that activity in D2-MSNs is associated with
extinction-induced refraining from cocaine seeking.
 Akin to the NAcore, the dlVP contains two primary cell types, one expressing glutamate
(VPglu) and the other expressing GABA (VPGABA). Also, a subpopulation of VPGABA co-express
enkephalin (VPPenk). We have begun to study the dlVP subcircuits coded by these distinct dlVP
neuronal subtypes in regulating cocaine seeking and refraining from seeking. Cell-type specific
chemogenetic stimulation reveals that VPglu inhibit reinstated cocaine seeking and stimulating
VPPenk induces cocaine seeking. Surprisingly, VPglu and VPGABA cells in dlVP have different
axon terminal fields. These findings indicate distinct roles for the different dlVP neuronal
subtypes, and that divergent roles for subtype selective projections emanating from the dlVP is
likely. We propose to disentangle the circuitry in which the dlVP is embedded using a
combination of behavior, in vivo calcium imaging and slice electrophysiology, and test the
hypothesis that VPglu activity promotes refraining during extinction responding, while VPPenk
codes for cocaine seeking."
10814269,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This project will determine the effects of cannabis use on antiretroviral therapy (ART) pharmacokinetics (PK)
in persons living with HIV (PLWH), including mechanisms that may affect ART distribution into the CNS and
efficacy and neurotoxicity, which may have a significant impact on HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders
(HAND) and mood disorders such as depression. Cannabis use is common among PLWH and may modify ART
efficacy by altering several biological mechanisms that influence PK. While cannabis use may adversely affect
ART adherence, it also appears to reduce inflammation and inhibit two common ART drug metabolizing
pathways (cytochrome P450, CYP and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase, UGT). Considering the
emphasis of HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program (HNRP) on the central nervous system (CNS) and our
expertise in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pharmacology, our project will focus on blood-brain barrier (BBB)
permeability, CSF PK, and ART efficacy and neurotoxicity. HIV and drug use can each affect BBB permeability
and could play a key role in how HIV and ART affect the CNS. Despite this, little research has examined the
effects of cannabis on the BBB and cognitive and mood disorders in PLWH. In addition, prior studies have not
collected details about cannabis use that may determine its consequences, including mode of administration,
reason for use (medicinal or recreational), content (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, THC or cannabidiol, CBD), and
pattern of use (timing of ART administration relative to substance use).
 Aim 1 of the proposed project will address these knowledge gaps by determining the effects of cannabis use
on PK in CSF and blood for ART drugs that are representative of key CYP and UGT pathways. Participants will
be assessed at: 1) a baseline visit at which chronic cannabis use will be quantified, a dose of ART drugs will be
administered, concentrations of ART and cannabinoids will be measured, and cognition and depression
assessed (N=120); and 2) three Acute Cannabis Administration (ACA) visits at which either placebo, high THC
cannabis, or high CBD cannabis will be administered to a subgroup of 40 dolutegravir users in a crossover
randomized double-blind design. At the ACA visits, probe substrates for CYP (buspirone) and UGT
(acetaminophen) will also be administered. Aim 2 will focus on biological mechanisms and will assess the impact
of acute cannabis administration on metabolism of the CYP and UGT probe substrate drugs as well as on
indicators of BBB integrity, such as CSF/serum albumin ratio and expression of the molecular drug transporter
P-glycoprotein. Aim 3 will focus on how cannabis modifies ART PK-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationships
with HIV disease and cognitive and depression outcomes.
 The proposed project will address several priorities of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, including HIV-
associated comorbidities (substance use and HAND), and HIV pathogenesis (interaction between substance
use and ART PK)."

10818254,"Summary: Dura is the fibrous membrane that covers the brain and spine. Perforations in the dura (durotomy)
such as punctures, incisions or lacerations are often encountered during cranial and spinal surgery and require
repair and sealing to prevent serious and occasionally fatal complications related to leakage of cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF). Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures of the brain and spine significantly limit direct repair of
durotomies by traditional methods such as suture or staple closure, due to a combination of restricted working
space and access vectors and limited field of view (constrained deployment), and the often-friable nature of the
perforated dura. PatchClamp MedTech, Inc. is developing novel devices to enable rapid, safe, and immediate
watertight repair and sealing of durotomies encountered during MIS and open craniospinal procedures. A low-
profile, single-hand disposable applicator enables the surgeon to place a tissue or synthetic graft through a
narrow MIS access port onto the inner surface of the perforated dura and secure it in place with a clasp released
onto the outer dural surface. Prototypes using high resolution 3D printed bioabsorbable subcomponents and
commercially available synthetic dural substitutes have provided proof-of-concept. In this proposal, we refine
and test the efficacy of the device under a variety of frequently encountered MIS constraints in vitro and demon-
strate a stable watertight seal in vivo. Ease of application, sealing efficacy and survey feedback from surgeons
deploying the graft in this model will guide sequential modifications and scaling of the device. Aim 1. Assess
mechanical attributes of device components and dural sealing performance in vitro in unconstrained
access. Using clinically relevant burst pressure chamber models, we will assess the following attributes: easy
loading and release of the graft from the applicator, atraumatic passage of the graft through the dural perforation
with rapid re-expansion, precise release of the extradural clasp struts, elastic reformation of the struts against
the membrane after release, measurement of the force applied by the struts to the external surface of the mem-
brane, minimum strut force to maintain stability against lateral movement, and ability to unclasp and re-position
or remove the graft after initial deployment. We will demonstrate that the deployed graft maintains a watertight
seal under escalating pulsatile pressure in comparison to current dural closure techniques. Aim 2. Assess per-
formance in vitro under constrained access conditions. We will assess visualization, access, deployment,
and sealing efficacy compared to current dural closure techniques under constrained access models simulating
MIS approaches using a lumbar soft tissue simulator with both a pressurized acrylic burst chamber as well as a
pressurized spine laminotomy model. Surgeon input will guide design iterations. Aim 3. Demonstrate sealing
performance in vivo. The refined prototype will be used to test device graft deployment and sealing compared
to conventional dural closure in an acute pig laminectomy durotomy model. Successful completion will lead to
preclinical IDE-enabling work in preparation for first-in-human trials."

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer related death.
Approximately 20% of breast cancer cases are triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by tumors
negative for three receptors: estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2),
making specific hormone and antibody targeted therapies ineffective due to the lack of their therapeutic targets.
Treatment of TNBC involves both local therapies (surgery and radiation), and systemic therapies
(chemotherapy). However, compared to other types of breast cancer, TNBC is the most challenging form of
breast cancer to treat, is prone to recurrence and metastasis, and has a poor 5-year survival rate, especially in
later stages Notably, advanced BC with distant metastases is currently considered incurable.
Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 gene occur in 80% of cases of TNBC are associated with relapse
to the most aggressive treatments and mortality. Missense mutations in p53 (the protein encoded by this gene)
lead to production and accumulation of mutant p53 proteins without tumor suppressor capabilities. Any therapy
that could restore tumor suppressor functions to the accumulated p53 proteins would provide an outstanding
therapeutic opportunity to turn even the most aggressive cancers harboring p53 mutations into very treatable
ones with good prognosis. There are historic examples of this paradigm. The identification of BCR-Abl in chronic
myeloid leukemia or PML-RARA in promyelomonocytic leukemia and their selective therapies (Imatinib/Retinoic
acid), respectively turned the once uncurable cancers into curable diseases.
Weatherwax Biotechnologies is developing a novel, proprietary and highly innovative drug-discovery platform to
identify bifunctional molecules (BFMs) that reactivate tumor suppressor functions of p53 in the mutant isoforms.
BFMs are a new class of small-molecules with abilities to modulate drug targets that greatly exceed those of
traditional therapeutics. This is because BFMs don’t rely on direct binding to modulate drug targets (as standard
drugs do). Instead, they recruit endogenous “modifier protein” to bind to and alter the protein of interest. Given
the broad range of post-translational modifications classes of enzymes that catalyze upon other proteins, by co-
opting these catalytic capabilities, BFMs can enable mechanisms of action with unprecedented efficacy.
The objective of this project is to produce high quality BFM tool compounds with lead-like properties
capable of reactivation of mutant p53. Utilizing Weatherwax’s knowledge gained from the early screening of
BFMs, this research will identify hit compounds that selectively induce cell death only in p53 mutant tumor cells.
Utilizing parallel chemistry, a library of BFM compounds will be designed and synthesized (Specific Aim 1),
followed by selection of hit modifier proteins showing biological modulation of p53 activity in cellulo (Specific
Aim 2). Finally, through structure-activity relationship and ADME, high quality high affinity BFMs will be produced
(Specific Aim 3) that (although beyond the scope of this grant) can be then moved to preclinical studies."

Schistosomiasis, caused by parasitic helminths, remains a major global health problem currently affecting over
250 million people in 78 countries with an additional 800 million people at risk of infection. Schistosoma
haematobium causes female genital schistosomiasis and urinary schistosomiasis resulting in bladder cancer if
left untreated. S. haematobium infection often results in formation of lesions within the vaginal tract of women,
often rendering them more susceptible to HIV coinfection. Since 2014, urogenital schistosomiasis is now being
actively transmitted in Southern Europe, a region previously thought to be schistosomiasis-free. Over the course
of 20 years, we have developed a potent schistosomiasis vaccine for S. mansoni, termed SchistoShield®,
targeting a functionally important antigen, Sm-p80, formulated using the TLR4-targeting adjuvant GLA-SE.
SchistoShield® has been exhaustively tested in numerous animal models and has consistently exhibited
protection at all parasite life cycle stages. We are near completion of a Phase 1 safety and dose-ranging human
clinical trial with SchistoShield® in the US – with no safety signals reported – and will begin Phase 1B trials in
Africa in Q3 of 2023 with a future Phase 2 trial in Africa to be funded by the Gates Foundation. We hypothesize
that a Sh-p80-based vaccine for S. haematobium (HematoShieldTM) could be developed using our extensive
experience with SchistoShield®, and that this homologous vaccine will provide superior protection against
urogenital schistosomiasis.
In this STTR we propose two Aims: (1) produce and release vaccine candidates and then to (2) Evaluate the
vaccine candidates in an animal model of urogenital schistosomiasis. Successful completion of these Aims will
be crucial identifying which candidate vaccine for this burdensome disease will be progressed into future current
Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) production, stability, potency, and toxicology testing as well as important
clinical trials for efficacy against S. haematobium."

This application seeks a five-year continuation of the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study, an ongoing
epidemiological and etiological research and reporting project begun in 1975. In addition to being a basic
research study, MTF has become one of the nation's most relied upon sources of information on emerging trends
in illicit drug, alcohol, and tobacco use among American adolescents, college students, and adults. Nationally
representative samples of 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students (about 42,000 students per year) will be surveyed
annually from 2022/23 to 2026/27. A companion panel application seeks continuation of follow-up surveys of
both past and future high school graduates at modal ages 19–30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and, new to this cycle,
age 65. The study's cohort-sequential longitudinal design permits the measurement and differentiation of three
types of change—age (developmental), period (historical), and cohort. Each has different determinants, and MTF
finds all three types of change occur for most drugs. Factors that may explain historical trends and cohort
differences also are monitored. MTF is designed to document the developmental history and consequences of
drug use and related attitudes from adolescence through the retirement years, and to determine the individual
and contextual characteristics and social role transitions that contribute to change and stability in both use and
related attitudes. This work will be extended to new years, cohorts, and ages under this main application and the
companion follow-up application. The study will examine the importance of many other hypothesized
psychological, behavioral, and social determinants of drug use (including attitudes and beliefs, counter-
advertising, role-modeling, and access), as well as a range of potential consequences (including physical and
psychological health, status attainment, role performance, and symptoms of substance use disorders). Impacts
of policy changes will be examined, including new FDA policies aimed at the reduction of teen vaping. The study's
very broad measurement covers (a) initiation, use, and cessation for over 50 categories and subcategories of licit
and illicit drugs, including alcohol and tobacco; (b) attitudes and beliefs about many of them, including perceived

difficulties, delinquency, school performance, plans, aspirations, etc.); and (d) aspects of key social environments
(home, work, school) and social role statuses, experiences, and transitions. Results will continue to elucidate

Hearing in mammals is dependent upon the ability to efficiently conduct sound vibrations from
the environment to the inner ear. This conduction apparatus includes the auricle, external
auditory canal, tympanic membrane (TM), middle ear space, and ossicular chain. Although a
great deal of research has been directed to the biophysical properties of the ear less is known
about the cellular composition of these structures and how the diverse cells that make up these
structures are formed, maintained, and interact in pathological states. The TM has three layers:
an outer layer of stratified squamous epithelium, a middle layer of connective tissue, and an
inner layer of mucosal epithelium. It is unknown how many different cell types are present in
each of these layers, where the stem or progenitor cell populations of these layers reside, or the
dynamics of how these layers are maintained. Classic dye studies indicated that the outer
epithelium of the TM migrates radially outward from the malleal attachment to the TM. We and
others have shown that within the TM the vast majority of the proliferation is occurring near the
malleus, and that cells then migrate radially outward. This implies at least two populations: a
stem/progenitor population near the malleus, and a progeny population within the radial portions
of the TM. We will first dissociate normal and injured TMs from mice and humans, sort cells,
and perform single cell RNA sequencing analysis combined with nearest-neighbor clustering
analysis using a novel algorithm, CellfindR, in order to identify the cellular subpopulations within
the TM and to predict lineage relationships between them. We will confirm these populations by
using immunofluorescent staining of mouse and human TMs. We will then perform pulse-chase
labelling experiments using EdU as well as lineage tracing with genetically modified mice to
validate the lineage hierarchies predicted by the psuedotime analysis, and definitively identify
the stem and progenitor populations of the TM during perforation repair. Finally, we will perturb
the PDGFR and BMP signalling pathway in defined populations of the TM using inducible and
cell specific knockout mice in vivo as well as defined small molecule inhibitors in a novel ex vivo
air-liquid interface model of explanted mouse and human TMs in order to define the
mechanisms by which these populations differentiate and are maintained and to provide a
therapeutic proof of concept. We hope that once we gain a deeper understanding of the
functional cellular architecture and physiology within the TM, we can then learn how these
processes go awry in and create better biological and surgical treatments for disorders of the
TM."

The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted that mathematical modeling of infectious disease is critical
for data-informed decision making. At the same time, however, it has been made clear that the modeling
community does not have appropriately advanced informatics infrastructures that facilitate a rapid consensus
understanding during epidemics and that put the power of modeling in the hands of local public health
stakeholders. This project proposes three integrated elements to transform the workflow of constructing, testing,
and crowd-sourcing spatial epidemiological models to gain deep understanding of epidemics, to provide usable
decision-making tools for local stakeholders, and to propose concrete, locally focused solutions. Our proposal is
to develop a proof-of-concept, collaborative informatics framework for model construction, analysis and
comparison, followed by rigorous optimization of spatial intervention strategies. In Aim 1, we design EpiMoRPH
(Epidemiological Modeling Resources for Public Health), a system that will streamline and automate the
construction and testing of spatial models against benchmark data. EpiMoRPH will support rapid model
comparisons in a community-driven environment to build consensus and to produce a broad understanding of
which modeling approaches are most appropriate in different spatial contexts. Importantly, EpiMoRPH will assist
local public health stakeholders with deciding on the best, community-contributed models that are relevant for
their particular situations and will then implement those best models to make locally customized forecasts. In
Aim 2, we make advances in the automation of spatial and robust optimization algorithms, with the goal of
allowing non-expert users to generate tailor-made intervention strategies relevant to their local municipalities.
Here, we will develop a tool kit of robust optimization algorithms that account for various uncertainties and that
will gradually build upon the functionality of EpiMoRPH. Importantly, a driving motivation for this tool kit is to
ensure that the optimization routines allow public health stakeholders to balance the control of transmission and
disease outcomes with the equitable allocation of interventions across racial, ethnic, and socio-economic
sectors. In Aim 3, we will collaborate with a Public Health Advisory Council to test, formally evaluate, and refine
our model-based technologies, ensuring that our innovations meet the needs of public health partners, while
also appealing to the broader community of epidemiological modelers. Together our aims will build accessible
and sustainable technologies that put epidemiological modeling and optimization methods in the hands of local
public health decision-makers."

Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) remains incurable and lethal. Immunotherapy using immune checkpoint
blockade (ICB) antibodies revolutionized cancer treatment, yet advanced PCa is refractory to ICB therapy. PCa
has limited infiltration of effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which may contribute to ICB resistance.
However, the mechanism shaping the cold microenvironment of PCa is poorly understood. Recently, we
identified chromatin effector PYGO2 in the 1q21.3 amplicon as an oncogenic and metastatic driver for PCa (Lu
et al, 2018). PYGO2 binds to histone H3 tail methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me) and modulates transcription. Our
preliminary results suggest that PYGO2 is an emerging signaling hub to control immunosuppression and CTL
infiltration in a Wnt/β-catenin-independent manner, yet the precise mechanism for PYGO2 function in PCa
immune evasion is unclear. Moreover, the effect of targeting PYGO2 with selective inhibitors on PCa progression
and response to immunotherapy is unknown. Therefore, there is a significant need to unravel the function,
mechanism and targeting strategy of PYGO2 in order to enhance immunotherapy of PCa.
 Our central hypothesis is that PYGO2 is a major cancer cell-intrinsic mechanism to shape the
immunosuppressive microenvironment in PCa, and ICB therapy can be significantly enhanced by PYGO2
inhibition using novel small molecule inhibitors. We propose to accomplish three Specific Aims: (Aim 1) Elucidate
the epigenetic mechanism of PYGO2 function in the immunosuppression of PCa by integrating targeted and
unbiased approaches. (Aim 2) Determine the synergistic anti-tumor effect on PCa progression and metastasis
by combining PYGO2 ablation and ICB therapy. (Aim 3) Identify small molecule inhibitors of PYGO2 with anti-
tumor activity as single agent and in combination with immunotherapy.
 Upon completion of the project, we expect to illuminate novel molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying the role of PYGO2 in immune evasion of the PCa tumor microenvironment, establish the key
preclinical evidence on co-targeting PYGO2 and immune checkpoint pathways as a new strategy of effective
combination immunotherapy, and identify selective PYGO2 inhibitors with potent anti-tumor activity when used
as single agent or in combination with immunotherapy. Our results will advance understanding of how genetic
changes in cancer cells (i.e. PYGO2 amplification) can shape the cold tumor microenvironment. Given the
aberrant upregulation of PYGO2 in many cancer types, our studies are relevant to a large population of cancer
patients. In the long term, we envision that the bench-to-bedside translation of our findings through development
and clinical testing of the PYGO2 inhibitor(s) may accelerate the therapeutic application of the combined
epigenetic modulation and immunotherapy to the curative treatment of PCa and other cancers."

Transcription is the first step to read out the genetic information stored in the chromosome. In eukaryotes,
three multi-subunit RNA polymerases (Pols), Pol I, II, and III transcribe the 25S ribosomal RNA (rRNA),
protein-coding, and short non-coding RNAs such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and 25S rRNA genes, respectively. A
wealth of genetic and biochemical data accumulated over 50 years have uncovered most of the molecular
players involved and details of the intricate regulatory circuits. The recruitment and assembly of the initiation
complex at the promoter represent one of the key regulatory steps during gene expression. The Pol II initiation
machinery includes the activator-bound Mediator along with a series of general transcription factors (GTFs)
(TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH) that assemble into a ~4-megadalton (MDa) pre-initiation
complex (PIC) on core promoter DNA. On the other hand, the Pol III enzyme is recruited onto its promoter with
the help of corresponding GTFs (TFIIIC, TBP, BRF1, and B''). This proposal aims to investigate the
mechanism of transcription regulation by directly visualizing these transcriptional competent initiation
complexes using single-particle cryo-EM. Comparable pictures of these different but evolutionarily related
systems at this critical step of gene regulation will provide an unprecedented, comprehensive view of this key
process in the central dogma of molecular biology."

Importantly, it will be one of a handful of facilities throughout the world that provides Mass Spec Imaging
approaches to identify and characterize cellular proteins and extracellular matrix proteins in situ. The core has
extended these beyond protein identification to facilitate in situ Mass Spec Imaging of metabolites, lipids,

10823262,"Candidate: With my multidisciplinary background in Artificial Intelligence (PhD), Public Health Informatics
(MS), Epidemiology and Health Statistics (MS), and Preventive Medicine (Bachelor of Medicine), my career
goal is to become an independent investigator working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and
Biomedicine, with a particular emphasis initially in machine learning and public health.
Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and
scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement
my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong
mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael
Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development.
Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of
computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms
such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models
can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more
problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in
the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for
transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning,
explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a
target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model
from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN-
TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims
are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare
settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and
evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do
this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza.
Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I
expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a
region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection
capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced
biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and
lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects."
10823365,"Project Summary / Abstract
Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide and lumbar imaging has become ubiquitous in
its standard course of care. However, typical clinical imaging offers only a qualitative assessment of spine
anatomy and “new research to improve prognostic stratification of patients with chronic low back pain” was
recently called for by the NIH Pain Consortium Task Force on Research Standards for Chronic LBP.
Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, a primary or secondary cause of LBP, is characterized by the progressive
breakdown of the tissue's structure and composition resulting in altered mechanical behaviors and internal
disruptions that can provide a means for nerve ingrowth, a precursor for discogenic pain. Magnetic resonance
elastography (MRE) is a non-invasive imaging technique that tracks propagating strain waves as they move
through soft tissues and allows the measurement of tissue material properties in-vivo. Supporting data
demonstrates that MRE-derived shear stiffness can serve as a biomarker sensitive to this disease process and
can detect internal disruptions within operated IVDs compared to non-operated controls. Yet, improved MRE
scan sequences to reduce scan time, mechanical validation of MRE-derived viscoelastic properties, and
determination of the limits of MRE-detected internal disruptions are required prior to clinical utilization.
The long-term goal of this research is to provide a safe and non-invasive method to quantify the mechanical
function of musculoskeletal soft-tissues within the spine to allow early diagnosis of injury and disease, improve
patient stratification and facilitate in-vivo evaluation of restorative interventions for LBP. Aim 1 develops a custom
spin-echo echo-planar imaging MRE sequence to reduce scan times while simultaneously increasing SNR. Aim
2 validates the MRE-derived viscoelastic material properties of healthy and degenerated IVD tissue against
material testing and also determines the type, orientation and minimum defect size that MRE can detect in
cadaveric tissue. Aim 3 determines if MRE-derived measurements of material properties and internal defects
together with MR measurements of spatial variations in tissue composition can differentiate a painful and non-
painful IVD from asymptomatic subjects and disc-related chronic LBP patients, respectively. This work will
improve data collection in a reduced time, which is applicable to all MRE applications, and allow in-vivo
assessment of viscoelastic mechanical properties and internal damage. Non-invasive in-vivo assessment of IVD
mechanical function may allow the prognostic stratification of LBP patients and serve as a novel “patient specific”
clinical tool to identify damage and quantify the functional consequences of disease and treatment."
10823664,"Overall - Abstract
 Enteric bacterial infections are a significant global health concern, particularly in developing nations, where
they disproportionately affect children. These diseases include typhoid fever (caused by Salmonella enterica
serovar Typhi -S. Typhi-), invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS; e.g., S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium), and
shigellosis (caused by multiple Shigella serotypes). Limited knowledge of systemic and local gut immunity,
including immunological correlates of protection, for human-restricted enteric pathogens (e.g., Salmonella and
Shigella) continues to hamper vaccine development. Importantly, very limited information is available regarding
immune responses to these enteric pathogens in children. To address these major shortcomings, it is
imperative that studies involving human-restricted infectious agents are performed in children and adults. Thus,
we are proposing under the central theme of “Mechanisms of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity to Vaccination
and Infection with Enteric Pathogens in Children and Adults” to further our understanding of the protective
immunological mechanisms that can be elicited systemically and in the gut microenvironment by using
exclusively human based models with major human-restricted pathogens, i.e., Salmonella (S. Typhi, S.
Typhimurium S. Enteritidis) and Shigella flexneri 2a. These studies will use unique specimens from clinical
studies (Core 1) in which participants are immunized, or not, with parenteral or oral candidate vaccines against
these major enteric bacterial pathogens, and, in some cases, followed by challenge with wild type organisms
(Research projects -RP- 1-2). This will allow us to examine the mechanisms (e.g., epigenetic modifications)
involved in the induction and maintenance of human adaptive immunity associated with protection.
 Furthermore, because of the critical importance of innate immunity elicited in the gut, we will use explant
tissues and advanced in vitro models of the human gut mucosa (e.g., enteroids) to study the early crosstalk
between epithelial cells and innate immunity and the epigenetic mechanisms at play in the gut
microenvironment following exposure to Salmonella and Shigella (RP3). The mechanisms underlying immune
responses will be studied using advanced technologies e.g., suspension mass cytometry, imaging mass
cytometry (Core 3), EpiTOF, ATAC-seq, transcriptomics (RNA-seq), phosphoflow, and single-cell RNA-seq
(RP1-3). Mechanistic studies using unique human specimens, gut organoids and explants will employ common
methods of analysis and tools and the same wild type and attenuated bacterial strains. A world-class team of
systems biologists (Core 2) will integrate immunological and omics data. The proposed strategy involves
synergistic interactions among all RP’s and Cores supported by an interdisciplinary team of renowned
scientists in immunology, clinical studies, genomics, epigenetics, bioinformatics, modeling, biostatistics and
adjuvants. The long-term goal of this “Enteric CCHI” is to advance our knowledge of systemic and gut human
immunity to accelerate the development of novel and better vaccines for enteric bacterial pathogens."

Objectives
Antibiotic resistant bacteria are an immense and rapidly growing medical problem affecting Veterans, combat
warriors, and the broader population. Some infections are now considered “untreatable,” threatening to return
us to the pre-antibiotic era. Heteroresistance (HR) is an under-recognized yet widespread form of antibiotic
resistance in which a bacterial strain harbors a minor subpopulation of resistant cells co-existing with a majority
susceptible population. We showed that even when as infrequent as 1 in 1 million, these resistant cells can
rapidly replicate despite antibiotic treatment and thus cause treatment failure. However, we discovered a way
to exploit HR as the basis of effective combination therapy; when two drugs to which an isolate exhibits HR are
combined, each drug kills the cells resistant to the other and together they eradicate the infection. To avoid
monotherapy failures and select effective combination regimens, it is important to identify HR during clinical
antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST). However, current AST cannot detect and distinguish HR. This proposal
will develop a novel AST platform to detect HR, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.
Research Plan
Preliminary data suggest that optical interferometry can accurately and rapidly (1.5 hours) detect HR, as well
as outperforming current diagnostics in differentiating standard resistance (in which 100% of cells are resistant)
from susceptibility. We will elucidate optimal functional parameters for interferometry-based AST to balance
sensitivity, accuracy, and speed. We will then test the efficacy of the interferometry AST on a broad panel of
clinical bacterial isolates with diverse antibiotic resistance profiles, enhancing the system through an iterative
process. We will extend the indications of the system, determining if it is effective on spiked blood cultures,
abrogating the need for testing of pure colonies and further enhancing sample processing speed. Finally, we
will retrospectively study a collection of bacteria from 2 clinical trials, testing the ability of interferometry to
accurately detect HR as well as the association of HR with clinical outcomes.
Methods
This proposal is based on the innovative use of optical interferometry, a physics and material sciences
technology, to detect antibiotic resistance including HR. Interferometry generates a topographic map of the
surface of a bacterial population grown on agar with different respective antibiotics. “Peaks” of growing,
resistant cells are easily distinguished from “valleys” of non-growing, susceptible cells.
Clinical Relevance
The research in this proposal has the potential to provide clinicians with the most accurate and comprehensive
antibiotic resistance profile of bacterial strains. This could significantly improve the way antibiotics are selected
for therapy, helping to avoid unnecessary failures, and identifying effective combination therapies to treat
infections currently viewed as “untreatable.” This new AST platform has the potential to have a profound
positive impact on the care of Veterans and others, and to save lives."
10805823,"Phosphatidylcholine is the most common phospholipid in cell membranes, microvesicles, and lipoproteins; it
contains the phosphocholine head group (PC) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) that are susceptible to
lipid peroxidation by reactive oxygen species. Lipid peroxidation of PUFA generates oxidized phospholipids
(OxPLs) that are highly reactive and cause extensive cell damage. Oxidized phospholipids containing
phosphocholine (PC-OxPLs) are pathogenic in multiple conditions, including osteoporosis, cardiovascular
diseases, and steatohepatitis. Following the peroxidation of PUFA, the phosphocholine headgroup undergoes
a conformational change and becomes an epitope that is recognized and bound by the natural antibody E06
IgM which blocks the deleterious effects of OxPLs. Transgenic mice overexpressing a single chain (scFv) form
of the antigen-binding domain of the E06 IgM (E06-scFv) have increased bone mass at 6 months of age and
are protected against age-induced bone loss. E06-scFv increases bone formation and osteoblast number at
both cancellous and cortical sites. OxPLs decrease Wnt10b and Wnt target genes in osteoblastic cells.
Consistent with this, with unbiased approaches such as bulk RNA sequencing of vertebrae and single cell RNA
sequencing of osteoblastic cells we found that Wnt10b and Wnt target genes are upregulated in E06-scFv
transgenic mice compared to WT. Increasing the levels of antibodies against PC-OxPLs, by either
overexpressing E06-scFv or injecting a monoclonal E06 IgG antibody, is protective against multiple diseases
where PC-OxPLs play a pathogenic role such as atherosclerosis, ischemia reperfusion injury, vascular
inflammation, and steatohepatitis. Importantly, short term administration of a monoclonal form of E06 IgG
increases mineral apposition rate, indicating that the injectable antibody increases osteoblast function. We
have investigated the relationship between the endogenous levels of anti-PC antibodies and bone mineral
density (BMD) in humans in a cross-sectional study of 247 Veterans and found that the levels of anti-PC IgM
negatively correlate with both the T- and Z-scores at the femur. This correlation is maintained after adjusting
for age, race, and gender. Consistent with this, patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis at the femoral sites
had higher levels of anti-PC IgM compared to those with normal BMD. These results suggest that higher levels
of endogenous anti-PC IgM in patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis reflect higher exposure to PC-OxPLs,
although insufficient to prevent their adverse effects. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that PC-OxPLs
inhibit osteoblast differentiation and function by affecting Wnt signaling and their neutralization with exogenous
administration of a monoclonal E06 IgG antibody is an effective therapeutic intervention to increase bone mass
in mice. In humans, anti-PC IgM are a marker of for increased exposure to PC-OxPLs and may predict the loss
of bone with time. Studies proposed in this application will establish whether E06-scFv increases bone mass
by increasing Wnt10b by characterizing the bone phenotype of E06-scFv transgenic mice crossed with mice in
which Wnt10b has been globally deleted. We will also determine whether weekly injections of murine
monoclonal E06 IgG increase bone mass and reproduce the anabolic effects of the E06-scFv transgene in
young and old mice. Additionally, we will expand the clinical studies to determine whether the levels of the anti-
PC IgM correlate with baseline BMD, with longitudinal BMD changes in the elderly and with fractures. This will
be accomplished by measuring the levels of anti-PC IgM in a large cohort of patients from two epidemiological
studies: the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) and the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) in women.
Successful completion of these preclinical and clinical studies may lead to a novel therapy to simultaneously
prevent or ameliorate osteoporosis together with multiple age-related disease that are very common in the
aging veteran population."
10805085,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Socioeconomic and racial health disparities in the US are vast, with sinking life expectancy fueled by excess
mortality among poor and Black people. Hazardous working conditions, like low wages and poor job control,
propel disparities in mortality, self-rated health (SRH), and mental illness. Underused relational theories
suggest such conditions are caused by upstream power imbalances between workers, managers, and
employers: social classes divisible by managerial authority and business ownership. Trends like sinking labor-
union membership and surging class disparities in income suggest power has tipped away from workers, who
are most of the workforce and largely women and Black people. Thus, worsening disparities and population
health may reflect changing class power dynamics. However, while longitudinal studies have tested the effects
of downstream factors like wages, none using relational theories have tested class’s cumulative effects on
health over the life course, the modifying role of power dynamics, or the effects of worker empowerment. This
hinders efforts to identify adverse working conditions’ root causes and improve disparities and population
health. In the proposed K99/R00, I will obtain the advanced training needed to address these gaps and pursue
an independent research career. My research objectives are to: a) quantify class’s cumulative effects on SRH,
mental illness, and mortality over the life course, including by intersecting gender-race, b) test the modifying
role of power dynamics, and c) analyze the effects of workplace-level and state-level worker empowerment. To
achieve these objectives, I will apply methods to overcome the time-varying confounding that has impeded
prior research, like parametric g-formula and difference-in-differences designs, to nationally representative
1968-2019 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and 1986-2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
data on US adults. PSID and NHIS are among the largest longitudinal or repeated cross-sectional health
datasets with detailed class data. My work will be embedded within Columbia University’s Mailman School of
Public Health, where I will be supported by an interdisciplinary mentorship team with considerable experience
mentoring early-career investigators. My research will be fostered by a training plan that includes training in: 1)
intersectionality theory, 2) life-course and aging research, 3) methods for testing cumulative effects and time-
varying effect modification in settings with healthy-worker bias, and 4) econometric methods. The proposal will
advance the field by analyzing the overlooked root causes of work-related health disparities over the life course
and by identifying actionable policy solutions. My findings will be critical to meeting NIA’s strategic goals of
understanding aging-related health disparities and developing strategies to improve older-adult health. The
accompanying training plan will help me launch an independent research career studying and addressing the
structural power dynamics fueling social class disparities in health."

Molecular evolution and genomics research has entered an exciting phase with the advent of sequencing
techniques, enabling us to profile genome variation from hundreds of cells from an individual. Now, evolutionary
patterns and processes can be revealed at the highest cellular resolution. However, the state-of-the-art
phylogeny reconstruction methods perform poorly for cellular sequencing data because the number of genetic
variants is small due to a low mutation rate and short time span. Cellular sequence alignments are frequently
tall, i.e., a small number of variants (columns) and a large number of sequences (cells, rows). A common feature
of these tall datasets is the presence of sequencing error due to technical challenges associated with single-cell
sequencing. Even small sequencing errors cause inferred cellular phylogenies to become unreliable and produce
erroneous downstream biological inferences. We will develop innovative methods for molecular evolutionary and
phylogenetic analysis of tall data for studying somatic and pathogen evolution. Specifically, our aims will be to
(a) develop a mutation ordering and phylogeny estimation (MOPE) framework to infer tall data phylogenies
accurately and (b) integrate MOPE with traditional phylogenetic methods to further increase the accuracy of
evolutionary inferences. We will also (c) develop a library of software for high-throughput analysis of tall data.
Ultimately, the proposed software and research developments will advance molecular evolution and genomics,
bioinformatics, and biomedicine. New software and its source code will be made available free for research,
education, and training."

 Vocal communication plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of social interactions and is impaired
in a wide range of neurological disorders. Consequently, a major component of translational research focuses
on identifying circuit-level neurobiological mechanisms underlying social communication deficits. Determining
the neural mechanisms underlying social communication deficits requires both understanding the functions of
neural circuits as well as the ability to link neural circuits to specific naturalistic behaviors. However, obtaining
this information has been challenging because of the difficulties in interpreting complex behavioral interactions
in freely socializing animals. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the neural circuitry controlling
naturalistic social behaviors directly influenced by communication. This could ultimately allow communication
disorders to be treated by therapeutically targeting atypically functioning neural circuitry. In pursuit of this goal,
the overall objective in this proposal is to determine how social communication is encoded in the nervous
system and the role it plays in shaping behavior. The proposal uses a novel microphone array system to track
the vocal behavior of freely socializing, individual adult mice—a technique that has eluded the field for 50
years. Coupling this innovative method with in vivo wireless electrophysiology and machine-learning
techniques used for robustly extracting meaningful social information will enable identification of the neural
circuits that encode social communication and the role communication plays in directly shaping social
behavior. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mice emit behavior-dependent vocalizations that directly alter the
social dynamics between animals. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that behaviorally-dependent vocalizations are
encoded in the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the lateral entorhinal
cortex, one of the primary cortical inputs to CA2, encodes the locations of vocalizations in egocentric reference
frames. The proposed research will have a broad impact as these studies will provide fundamental insight into
the neurobiological basis of social communication. Moreover, these experiments will lay the groundwork for
future studies examining the neural basis of social communication in mouse models of neurological disorders,
such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and autism spectrum disorders."

The arcuate nucleus-median eminence complex (Arc-ME) is an evolutionarily conserved region
of the hypothalamus that plays important roles in physiology and behavior, including control of
appetite, energy balance, insulin sensitivity, fertility and lactation. In rodent models, the initiation
of a high fat diet (HFD) rapidly induces inflammation specifically within Arc-ME, well in advance
of inflammation observed in peripheral tissues. Genetic studies disrupting this inflammation
protect from obesity, suggesting the inflammation is causal, and studies in humans show a
correlation between arcuate inflammation and obesity. The arcuate has a unique anatomical
relationship with bloodstream, as there is no classic endothelial Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB)
separating it from the median eminence, which is invaginated by fenestrated capillaries that are
continuous with the peripheral circulation. Here, tanycytes, specialized ependymal cells found
lining the ventricular wall of the basal hypothalamus, extend elaborate processes that separate
the Arc and ME, thereby partitioning the ME, CSF, and brain parenchyma into distinct
compartments. Studies of hypothalamic inflammation have not previously addressed a role for
tanycytes, despite their unique localization. Using single cell RNA-seq, we observe that HFD
induces an interferon response pathway specifically in 2 tanycytes, the subpopulation that
contacts the peripheral circulation. We hypothesize that 2 tanycytes are sentinel cells that
respond to signals associated with HFD by upregulating an inflammatory gene program and
initiates hypothalamic inflammation. We propose to test this hypothesis by examining whether
genetic models in which the interferon response program is specifically induced or disrupted in
tanycytes is sufficient/necessary for induction of hypothalamic inflammation. We further propose
to define specific interferon regulatory factor targets by which tanycytes elicit inflammation using
a combination of transcriptional and epigenomic profiling within tanycytes and estimation of cell-
cell communication from single cell sequencing of our perturbed models. Together, these studies
will demonstrate a new role for tanycytes in initiating HFD-induced hypothalamic inflammation
and identify specific molecular targets that enable them to do so. As 2 tanycytes are located
outside of the BBB, they provide an attractive and specific target cell type modulating energy
homeostasis against which to design therapeutics to combat obesity."

 Built upon a history of sustained commitment to becoming a clinician scientist, the goal of this proposal is
to become an independent investigator and leader in the field of translational cancer research and molecularly-
guided precision medicine trials in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PDAC impacts over 50,000
people annually in the United States and will soon become the second leading cause of cancer-related death.
Two tractable strategies to increase survival in this devastating disease are: (1) to increase the utilization of
potentially curative surgical resection, and (2) to identify the optimal systemic therapy for each patient amongst
the cadre of agents currently prescribed in the clinic. To evaluate these strategies, this proposal is based upon
a multi-center, randomized, phase II clinical trial investigating the safety and efficacy of an aggressive surgical
approach to borderline resectable and locally advanced disease after combination cytotoxic chemotherapy,
radiation, and immunotherapy. In the context of this trial, we will also evaluate the capacity of a novel culture
technique, termed organoids, to provide clinically-actionable molecular data and guide precision medicine
approaches. Taken together, this proposal evaluates a treatment strategy that may result in a curative
operation for an additional 20-40% of newly diagnosed PDAC patients (10 - 20,000 US citizens annually) and
will evaluate a tool for selection of best systemic therapy for each PDAC patient to provide a durable survival.
 To foster a transition to independence and enable leadership in future projects, translational research
efforts will be supplemented during the award period with a formal career development plan. This plan is
guided by the mentorship of Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, a renowned leader in the field of translational research in
PDAC and the deputy director of the Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). As an
extramurally-funded researcher with an expertise in immune-focused and molecularly-guided clinical trials, Dr.
Jaffee is an ideal mentor. An advisory committee has been established to include the world’s leading expert in
PDAC organoids, Dr. David Tuveson, and a leader in surgical science initiatives, Dr. Christopher Wolfgang. I
have joined the Division of Surgical Oncology as a surgeon-scientist with 75% protected research time. The
research and training plan will be completed at JHU, one of the world’s leading institutions for pancreatic
cancer care and a top-ranked research institution. In the rich environment and resources of JHU, I will pursue
didactic coursework in the design and conduct of novel translational research and clinical trials. To reach
independence as a surgeon-scientist, I will also draw upon the resources of a formal K-to-R transition program
administered by the JHU Institute for Clinical and Translational Research. Support through the K08 Career
Development Awards Program will be critical in helping me to achieve a long-term goal of serving as a leader
in molecularly-guided precision medicine trials that have the potential to redefine outcomes in PDAC."
10795845,"ABSTRACT
Mammalian platelets are small anucleate blood cells specialized to continuously monitor and preserve the
integrity of the cardiovascular system (hemostasis). They are produced by megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone
marrow and released into blood, where they circulate for ten days in humans and five days in mice until they
get cleared by phagocytes. Platelet homeostasis, i.e. the establishment of a defined peripheral platelet count,
requires tight regulation of both platelet production and clearance. To fulfill their hemostatic function, platelets
depend on a very sensitive signaling machinery that facilitates platelet adhesion under shear stress. This high
sensitivity, however, poses a risk for unwanted platelet activation that can lead to platelet clearance and/or
thrombosis. The overarching goal of our work is to achieve a better understanding of the molecular
mechanisms regulating MK development and platelet reactivity, with a specific focus on the role of small
GTPases in these processes. This R35 OIA application is an extension to three funded NHLBI R01 grants:
Small GTPases in Megakaryocyte Biology; Rap1 Signaling in Platelet Homeostasis and Vascular Hemostasis;
Spatial Regulation of Platelet Activation by Podoplanin-Clec2 Signaling. Our MK studies utilize unique
biosensors to establish a molecular signature of small GTPase activity (both Rho and Rap GTPases) during
the final stages of development, including the transition from proliferation to proplatelet formation. Once
established, we will establish proof-of-principle that precisely targeted perturbation of GTPase activity by
optogenetic tools is a viable strategy to optimize in vitro platelet production, a hot topic in Transfusion
Medicine. Our platelet work focuses more specifically on the role of Rap GTPases as master regulators of
cellular activation and hemostatic plug formation. We have utilized unique mouse models to establish the
importance and the key regulators of Rap1 signaling during platelet activation. Furthermore, we have shown
that Rap1 activity has to be tightly balanced both in quiescent, circulating and in hemostatically active platelets,
and that disturbance of this pathway leads to bleeding or thrombocytopenia/ thrombosis. In ongoing and future
work, we will expand on our cell biological and biochemical/-physical studies to provide a comprehensive
understanding of how Rap signaling controls platelet function, how it is regulated, and if/ how it contributes to
other patho-physiological processes such as vascular integrity in development/ inflammation and venous
thrombosis. We will use our unique biochemical assays to screen for inhibitors of Rap signaling. Our clinical
studies will investigate if Rap1 signaling is altered in various pathologies, and whether there is interindividual
variability in this pathway in healthy and diseased subjects? Together, these studies are expected to lead to
novel strategies for the diagnosis and management of some inherited and acquired thrombocytopenias and
bleeding disorders, and to a more personalized approach to anti-platelet therapy."

Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) sequelae damage the cerebral microvasculature and augment Alzheimer's
pathology by inducing brain insulin resistance characterized by sub-physiological insulin levels and impaired
insulin-signaling in the brain. Conversely, soluble amyloid beta (sAβ) peptides that accumulate in the plasma
and brain during Alzheimer's progression exacerbate the impact of T2DM and aggravate brain insulin
resistance. A critical need exists to identify how T2DM sequelae and sAβ exposure inhibit insulin delivery to
the brain and intensify brain insulin resistance. The long-term goal is to elucidate cerebrovascular and
metabolic contributions to Alzheimer's disease and facilitate the development of novel therapeutic
interventions. The overall objective in this application is to determine the combined effects of T2DM sequelae
and sAβ on insulin delivery to the brain and to identify the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. The
central hypothesis is that T2DM sequelae and sAβ peptides perturb insulin signaling/trafficking at the
cerebrovascular endothelium [referred to as the blood brain barrier (BBB)] and reduce insulin delivery to the
brain. It is also hypothesized that these effects are further aggravated by the pathological synergism between
T2DM sequelae and sAβ. The rationale for the proposed research is that a mechanistic understanding of how
sAβ exposure and T2DM sequelae disrupt brain insulin delivery will allow us to develop novel therapeutic
strategies to address brain insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease and T2DM. Guided by preliminary data,
the following three specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine the effect of T2DM sequelae on insulin
trafficking/signaling at the BBB; 2) Determine the effects of sAβ alone and in conjunction with T2DM sequelae
on insulin trafficking/signaling at the BBB; and 3) Identify insulin trafficking pathways at the BBB, vulnerable
to sAβ exposure and impaired insulin signaling. Under the first and second aims, dynamic SPECT/CT imaging
will be used to characterize insulin uptake kinetics at the BBB in mouse models that exhibit T2DM and
Alzheimer's sequelae. Moreover, the dysregulation in insulin signaling at the BBB will be captured by reverse
phase protein arrays. For the third aim, flow cytometry and TIRF microscopy will be used to determine the
effects of sAβ ± insulin signaling inhibitors on insulin transcytosis in BBB monolayers. The proposed research
is potentially innovative because it employs dynamic imaging methods coupled with quantitative modeling
techniques to capture changes in insulin trafficking kinetics at the BBB in T2DM and Alzheimer's mouse
models. The proposed research is significant because the contribution it is expected to have broad translational
importance in repurposing existing drugs to treat brain insulin resistance and in identifying candidate targets
to discover novel drugs. Upon completion of the work, the new knowledge generated is expected to have an
important positive impact by facilitating the identification of novel therapeutic strategies to combat brain
insulin resistance in Alzheimer's patients with T2DM."
10795917,"Glucocorticoids (GCs, generically known as “steroids”) are exceptionally effective drugs in the control of a wide
variety of immune-mediated diseases, including asthma. They are also used to treat viral-induced inflammation
in the context of asthma exacerbations. Through reducing inflammation in tissues such as airway smooth muscle
(ASM), inhaled GCs are very effective in the majority of asthma patients, whereas systemic therapy, which
causes side effects, is used to treat asthma exacerbations. Despite using best therapies, over one million
Americans continue to be afflicted with difficult-to-control asthma and frequent exacerbations. Thus, new
pharmacologic approaches aimed at steroid signaling mechanisms in the lung, including ASM, are urgently
needed to improve treatment for asthma.
 GCs primary biochemical function is to bind to the GC receptor (GR), leading to regulation of transcription
directly by GR, which is a transcription factor. ASM is a key target tissue of GCs in asthma, and ASM exhibits
hyper-contractility, remodeling and exuberant cytokine expression in asthma. Previous efforts to exploit steroid-
controlled pathways as a method to improve asthma therapies directed at ASM have been predicated on the so
called “transrepression” model of GR activity, in which GR is thought to reduce inflammation by antagonistic
tethering to pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as NFkB. Entirely contrary to dogma, this grant
application is focused instead on transcriptional induction by GR and cooperation between GR and NFkB. Our
preliminary data implicate GR-NFkB cooperation as central to controlling inflammation in ASM, thus likely
contributing significantly to efficacy of steroids. Mechanistically, our data suggest this pathway involves
transcription of enhancer RNAs and formation of chromatin loops, and our data also suggest this mechanism is
druggable. Based on our promising findings on GR-induced pathways, we have also created a novel method to
interrogate GR-induced enhancer RNA signatures for genetic links to asthma. Our overarching hypothesis is
that GR-mediated transcriptional induction and GR-NFkB cooperation in ASM is crucial for steroid efficacy in
asthma and these pathways are linked to risk of developing asthma. We will test this hypothesis with three
specific aims, which will also address crucial molecular knowledge gaps. In Aim 1, we will determine the
comprehensive set of enhancer RNAs that are induced cooperatively by GR/NFkB and determine if these
enhancer RNAs loop to the promoters of anti-inflammatory genes. In Aim 2, we will determine the DNA sequence
requirements and additional factors involved in cooperative regulation by GR and NFkB, and we will test the
therapeutic relevance of this pathway in translational models. In Aim 3, we will identify novel genetic associations
between SNPs, GR-induced enhancers and asthma, and we will determine the relevance of these SNPs to GR
signaling and ASM function."
10795918,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer is a genetic disease, and the set of mutations in a tumor affects both its behavior and its response to
therapies. Large sequencing initiatives have produced catalogs of gene variants arising in different cancers.
Substantial challenges remain, however, in interpreting their effects. First, even when variants affect the same
gene, their molecular phenotypes may be distinct. Second, many variants are common enough that they have
been identified, but still sufficiently rare that no targeted studies have characterized them. Finally, cancer in
general arises from cooperation among multiple mutations, so the function of a variant in one context—cell
type, genetic background, or environment—may only partly inform its behavior in another. The sheer number
of possible variants and contexts argues for taking a systematic approach to phenotyping. Here, we present
BEAT-seq (Base Editing Allele Transcriptome sequencing), a flexible, scalable, and robust approach for
engineering cancer-associated variants by CRISPR-mediated base editing and measuring the resulting effects
on cellular phenotype by single-cell RNA sequencing. Robustness follows from our development of a sensor
assay that can quantify the base editing efficiency of many sgRNAs in parallel, enabling us to identify those
that reliably introduce cancer variants. We then exploit an improved Perturb-seq protocol, enabling us to
introduce libraries of variants in pooled format and simultaneously capture both the sgRNAs, encoding the
programmed edits, and single-cell transcriptomes, carrying their phenotypic consequences. In Aim 1, we
credential BEAT-seq by generating validated sgRNAs targeting common cancer variants. We profile the effects
of these variants across different epithelial cell types—pancreatic and lung—and across different genetic
backgrounds to study the role of context. Finally, we explore whether BEAT-seq can assign function by
constructing a library targeting ~500 somatic and germline variants of unknown significance identified through
MSK-IMPACT sequencing. These tasks grow gradually in analytical complexity. In Aim 2, we establish rigorous
statistical pipelines for the interpretation of single-cell functional genomics experiments. We show that the
orthogonal characterization from the sensor assay enables a Bayesian approach to identify edited and
unedited cells, addressing a central challenge that affects many single-cell screens. We then develop a data
normalization procedure for representing perturbations’ effects in relative terms, enabling comparisons to be
made across contexts. Finally, in Aim 3 we conduct in vivo BEAT-seq experiments profiling cells carrying
dozens of p53 variants introduced by orthotopic transplantation into mouse pancreases. This work enables
parallelized characterization of cancer variants on a scale not previously feasible. Our results will provide
insight into how variants affect tumor phenotype in different contexts, illuminate the role of variants of unknown
significance, and provide a gold standard set of tools for conducting and analyzing single-cell base editing
experiments."
10793832,"Project Summary
Rates of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) with socioemotional deficits are rapidly rising, including general
and social anxiety disorders (ADs, more common in women). Although environmental factors, including chemical
exposures in early development, are universally thought to increase NDD risk, most work to date has almost
exclusively focused on genetic factors. One of the few environmental factors implicated in sex-specifically
impacting behaviors relevant to NDDs with socioemotional deficits is developmental exposure to flame retardants
(FRs). FRs and its components are widely used in electronics, infant products, and furniture, resulting in
ubiquitous human exposure. Our previous work has shown that developmental exposure to the chemical FR
mixture Firemaster 550 (FM 550) sex-specifically alters anxiety and social behavior in several species. Since it
is challenging to directly link environmental chemical exposure to NDD-relevant behavioral and neural endpoints
due to the lack of human-typical social behaviors in many laboratory rodents, we have employed the more
human-relevant, spontaneously prosocial animal model, the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster). In the prairie
vole model, developmental FM 550 exposure sex-specifically impacted anxiety, social interaction, exploratory
motivation, and social pair bond formation. The greatest effects were detected in females, who displayed
generalized and social anxiety, while males displayed a decreased ability to form social pair bonds. The
mechanisms by which FM 550 exposure alters the neural systems that are integral to these behaviors and
disorders remain poorly understood, providing the rationale for this proposal. Here we focus on dopamine (DA),
oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) systems in the social brain neural network (SBNN), which includes sexually
differentiated brain regions such as the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) that are key for coordinating NDD-relevant
behaviors. We will leverage the prairie vole model and our synergistic expertise in developmental
neurotoxicology, autoradiography, genetics, electrophysiology, and neurochemistry to identify how FM550
impacts DA/OT/AVP receptor expression, receptor action on neuron function, and DA signaling as assessed
using voltammetry in awake behaving animals. Our central hypothesis is that developmental exposure to FM
550 disrupts DA/OT/AVP receptor density, DA/OT/AVP electrical function, and DA signaling in awake, behaving
animals. We address this central hypothesis in voles of both sexes. There are three aims: 1) Test the hypothesis
that developmental FM 550 exposure impacts DA/OT/AVP receptor density and related gene expression, 2) Test
the hypothesis that developmental FM 550 exposure impacts DA/OT/AVP receptor action on neuron electrical
function, and 3) Investigate the effects of developmental FM 550 exposure on DA signaling relevant to social
interactions. Overall, the proposed studies are significant and high impact because they leverage a unique model
animal with enhanced translational value to identify specific novel mechanisms by which DA/OT/AVP receptors,
neuron function and DA signaling are vulnerable to developmental chemical exposures."

The objectives of the NIH Stroke NET are to harness multidisciplinary stroke expertise to collaboratively and efficiently conduct NINDS-sponsored stroke trials in all domains (acute, prevention, recovery). The Ohio Valley (formerly Cincinnati) Regional Coordinating Center is composed of 33 hospitals served by the University of Cincinnati (UC) stroke team network, and one highly active satellite hospital, The Ohio State University with 6 enrolling hospitals. Our goals are to (1) efficiently initiate trials, recruit and retain participants, and optimize data quality; (2) actively contribute to the overall success of NIH Stroke NET; and (3) Successfully train the next generation of stroke researchers. We will achieve this by continuing to bring an established research infrastructure, a large and diverse patient population, experienced leadership, a rich training program, and a supportive administration. We have been successful as an RCC by all metrics in the prior grant cycle, including rapid trial initiation, high trial recruitment, high data quality, and consistent Stroke NET participation. Our sites have shown their commitment to NIH Stroke Net’s training mission by maintaining a robust training and education program. Our department has shown its support by providing additional funds to complete the RCC trainee’s salary and benefits and support effort of our Research Manager. We are committed to continued partnership with NIH Stroke NET to advance stroke care and research opportunities for our patients."
10796962,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Gestational diabetes (GDM) complicates 10% of pregnancies in the US annually and is rising dramatically as a
result of the obesity epidemic. GDM and the resulting maternal hyperglycemia lead to significant maternal and
neonatal complications that can be reduced with glycemic control. The extent of treatment needed is based on
maternal glycemic response to medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and exercise; yet at least 30-50% of patients
will fail the initial trial of MNT and exercise and subsequently require pharmacotherapy. It is crucial to note, that
the definition of what constitutes an unsuccessful attempt at MNT and exercise has not been established.
Consequently, initiation of pharmacotherapy is at a provider’s discretion with a wide variation in practice. We
recently demonstrated this variation in a national survey of 452 Maternal-Fetal Medicine providers (MFMs),
with >80% of MFMs requesting evidence-based recommendations to guide initiation of pharmacotherapy. We
also showed that earlier pharmacotherapy initiation at 20% elevated glucose values improved composite
neonatal outcome. However, such intensified treatment could also increase the risk of a small-for-gestational
age and may carry a negative impact on patient reported outcomes such as anxiety, depression and stress.
Finally, the lack of standardized guidelines for pharmacotherapy initiation may introduce biases and lead to a
variation in healthcare delivery by race and ethnicity. Therefore, there is a critical need to address this major
gap in clinical practice of GDM and investigate the efficacy, safety, and patient reported outcomes of earlier
pharmacotherapy initiation for GDM. We plan to address this gap with GDM and Pharmacotherapy (GAP)
study, a randomized controlled trial of 416 patients with GDM that will compare two thresholds (20% vs. 40%)
of elevated glucose values prior to insulin initiation. Our central hypothesis is that initiating insulin earlier,
defined as 20% elevated glucose values, compared with controls, defined as 40% elevated glucose values,
will result in reduced GDM-related adverse outcomes and disparities in GDM management, without adverse
health consequences. Our hypothesis has been formulated based on our pilot data favoring the 20% threshold
for clinical outcomes. The active control group chosen to be 40% based on our survey results demonstrating
that 75% of MFMs start pharmacotherapy at 40% elevated glucose values. We will pursue the following three
specific aims:1) Determine the effect of earlier insulin initiation for GDM management on adverse neonatal
and maternal outcomes associated with GDM; 2) Assess the safety of earlier insulin initiation in pregnant
patients and their neonates; and 3) Determine the effect of earlier insulin initiation on patient-reported
outcomes using standardized measures and qualitative interviews. The GAP study will provide a high-level
evidence for pharmacotherapy initiation in GDM and will have a direct impact on clinical practice. If proven
effective and safe, earlier pharmacotherapy initiation will improve the health of pregnant patients and their
offspring and will promote standardization of GDM management."

The need for a diverse environmental health workforce has growing urgency as the population of
the planet nears eight billion people and the environmental health impacts of natural disasters
and drought become evident on every continent. In addition to understanding how environmental
stressors impact human health, scientists of the next generation will need to work across
disciplines to develop viable solutions to environmental and social challenges. Yet the disciplines
that underpin environmental health sciences—biomedical, clinical and behavioral sciences—lack
the diversity that bolsters effective problem solving (Ferrini-Mundy, 2013). More broadly, women,
persons with disabilities, and three racial and ethnic groups—people of African American,
Hispanic, and/or American Indian and Alaska Native descent—remain underrepresented in
science and engineering education programs and employment (NAS, 2011; NSF, 2019). Pursuit
of STEM careers requires additional support for all students, especially underrepresented minority
and women students who contend with systemic racial and gender bias. For these students, the
likelihood of persisting in STEM majors is influenced by opportunities to meaningfully participate
in the academic community and develop supportive relationships with faculty and peers (Figueroa
et al., 2015; PCAST, 2012; Tsui, 2007).
Within this context, the Curriculum in Toxicology & Environmental Medicine (CiTEM) in the UNC-
Chapel Hill School of Medicine, together with the UNC Institute for the Environment (UNC-IE) and
the Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences at NC Central University (NCCU), propose
an environmental health-focused undergraduate research program to expand and diversify the
pool of students entering the environmental health workforce. The 21st Century Environmental
Health Scholars program will provide mentored research experiences and professional
development for students from diverse backgrounds, with a goal of preparing these students for
further studies or research careers in environmental health sciences. We will accomplish this goal
through the following aims.
 Aim 1. Facilitate summer undergraduate research opportunities in environmental health
sciences.
 Aim 2. Facilitate academic-year undergraduate research experiences and broaden
 professional development to include environmental health sciences careers, science
 communication, and community engagement.
 Aim 3. Implement robust mentorship training that incorporates evidence-based practices in
 mentoring diverse students and cohort building opportunities.
Over five years, this program will prepare 25 diverse undergraduates for careers in environmental
health sciences, introducing them to cutting-edge research topics and facilitating essential skills
development. At the same time, participating mentors will enhance their ability to create and
sustain inclusive learning environments. Together, these activities will encourage the participation
of individuals from diverse backgrounds to pursue environmental health sciences research and
careers."
10796968,"Significant progress in diabetes device technology has been realized over the past two decades. These novel
technologies improve glycemic control over daily injections thus reducing the probability of encountering
diabetic complications. Insulin infusion pump sets provide dosing flexibility and enhanced clinical efficacy in
terms of reducing HbA1c and severe hypoglycemic events. Despite these technological improvements in
insulin delivery systems, current best-practice set wear is typically limited to three days. Current challenges to
extending the lifespan of subcutaneous insulin administration sets and infusion pumps involve unreliable
insulin efficacy through the development of skin pathologies. Currently, all commercially available insulin
formulations contain insulin phenolic preservatives (IPP) known as excipients that are a double edge sword.
While they provide insulin protein stability, sterility and prolong insulin shelf life, our laboratory has recently
shown that these are cytotoxic, induce inflammation and secondary fibrosis. Subsequently, our data in murine
and porcine models demonstrated that proximate pre-infusion IPP removal significantly reduces infusion site
inflammation while maintaining protein functionality. Thus, the two major obstacles to increased infusion set
wear time are the chemotoxicity of the IPP and the transdermal cannula induced tissue injury, both of which
are inflammation driven. Mature mast cells (MC) reside in cutaneous tissue. Thus, MC are one of the first
responder in skin injury and are key contributors in orchestrating the inflammatory response once the skin is
breached. Therefore, our central hypothesis, supported by our published and preliminary data, is that
accumulative IPP and the transdermal injection and infusion devices contribute to local skin irritation due to
mast cell activation and subsequent leukocyte recruitment, thus initiating the inflammatory cascade. As MC
interact with macrophages (MQ) we further hypothesize that increased MC degranulation promotes M1
phenotype leading to phagocytosis insulin uptake/degradation by neutrophils & MQ and thus altering blood
glucose control. Therefore, our overall goals are, first, to determine how MC activation occurs, and, second,
the contribution to the resulting tissue reactions (inflammation and fibrotic cascades) while correlating IPP
concentration and composition for the duration of the infusion period. We will test our hypothesis in three
specific aims: 1) determine IPP induced MC activation and insulin degradation, 2) employ novel transgenic
mouse models (Cre/loxP) to determine the mechanisms and mediators of IPP and device MC induced
inflammation, and 3) preserve long-term tissue integrity during insulin infusion pump therapy in a pre-clinical
porcine model. Ultimately, the successful accomplishment of this proposal could result in transforming current
diabetes management practices that would achieve the goals of increasing the lifespan of insulin infusion
devices and most importantly, sustaining a tissue site available for future recurrent insulin administrations."
10794764,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 More than 25-35% of children with velopharyngeal (VP) or palatal anomalies, such as those associated
with repaired cleft palate and/or craniofacial conditions, will develop velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) as
evidenced by hypernasal speech. This can negatively impact quality of life and communication abilities across
the lifespan if not corrected during childhood. VPD often requires surgical management to achieve an anatomy
capable of producing normal speech and balanced resonance. However, an extremely high failure rate (up to
32%) is reported for these surgical procedures, and numerous revision surgeries are necessary. With each
revision surgery, the likelihood for success further decreases. Furthermore, although the consequences of VPD
are well established, the fundamental anatomic underpinnings for what constitutes functional VP anatomy from
non-functional anatomy is poorly understood due to the inability for clinicians to objectively quantify the VP
mechanism and consider patient-specific variables in the pre-operative assessment process.
 Recent work utilizing MRI has emerged as a methodology to facilitate improved understanding of the VP
anatomy. However, previous efforts to understand the VP mechanism have been significantly limited by small
sample sizes and time-intensive analytic methods. What is needed is a major technological advancement in our
ability to quantify the VP anatomy and utilize this information to integrate patient-specific measurements into the
clinical decision-making process.
 The main objectives of this R21 project are to deliver a cutting-edge, artificial intelligence/deep learning
framework for automated 3D segmentation and 2D measurement of VP structures (Aim 1), to develop a large
dataset to test foundational hypotheses on the relationships between velopharyngeal anatomy and speech
resonance (Aim 2), and assess feasibility for integration of anatomic analyses in a clinical workflow (Aim 3).
These advancements will lay a critical foundation by developing a clinically feasible method for accurate, pre-
operative assessment of the VP mechanism, which will accelerate clinical translation and development of precision
medicine approaches. This will lead to exciting opportunities for patient-specific surgical planning and operation
with a higher success rate. This will ultimately improve communication outcomes and quality of life for children
with VPD."

Osteonecrosis (ON) is a common and severe side-effect of modern therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). It most frequently impacts older children (≥10 years old) and young adults, with 15-45% of patients in
these groups developing ON symptoms during therapy. Severe ON causes pain and limited mobility, requiring
orthopedic surgery including joint replacement. There are currently no interventions which reduce this risk.
This award application describes a career development plan to allow me to evolve into a successful
independent clinical investigator and achieve my long-term goal of being an independent investigator leading
clinical trials which reduce the toxicity of ALL therapy. The short-term goal of this project is to test an
intervention for its ability to decrease osteonecrosis. Our preliminary preclinical data showed that intensive
antihypertensive therapy reduces ON in this setting without impairing the anti-leukemia effect of chemotherapy.
We will now test this in the clinic by evaluating the ability of intensive antihypertensive control (targeted to the
50-75th percentile for age, sex, and height) to reduce ON (as measured by 9 month MRI) compared to standard
antihypertensive control (targeted to the 90-95th percentile) by randomizing 160 children and young adults ages
10-18.99 years enrolled on the Total 17 ALL trial to either intensive or standard antihypertensive control
(Research Aim 1). Building on our preclinical data, we will also test the ability of biomarkers of vascular
dysfunction to identify patients at highest risk of developing ON (Research Aim 2). Finally, we will measure
patient-reported quality of life outcomes (PROs) to determine how both the intervention and osteonecrosis
impact patients’ health-related quality of life (Research Aim 3).
This career development award will also prepare me to achieve my long-term goals as an independent
investigator. The practical experience of leading the proposed clinical trial, combined with didactic education in
clinical trial design and structured mentorship, will increase my expertise as a clinical researcher (Training Aim
1). The award will also support training and mentorship in vascular physiology to improve both the analysis of
the planned trial as well as to improve future trials (Training Aim 2). Finally, I will receive training, mentorship,
and practical experience in the use of PROs to better implement these tools in future trials to best understand
patient complications from therapy (Training Aim 3).
This proposal may identify the first intervention to reduce ON in patients with ALL. Such an intervention would
have implications for patients with other malignancies or autoimmune diseases who are also at risk of
developing ON due to prolonged glucocorticoid treatment. Simultaneously, the training supported by the award
will prepare me for a successful career as a clinician scientist to reduce therapy toxicity in children with ALL."

 The burden of stroke disproportionately impacts the Southeast United States- a region known as the “Stroke Belt”. Outreach to populations in this region for stroke education, prevention, acute treatment, rehabilitation, and participation in clinical research, remains a challenge. In order to change the disproportionate stroke burden of this region, a highly functional clinical and research multicenter infrastructure to engage populations at high risk for stroke is critical.  In this application, investigators in the Southeast Collaborative Alliance for Stroke Trials (SE-CoAST) are committed to continuing to serve as a Regional Coordinating Center (RCC) in Stroke Net. SE-CoAST is now an expanded, robust collaboration between 5 tertiary care medical centers situated in the heart of the Stroke Belt: the Medical University of South Carolina along the South Carolina (SC) coast, the University of South Carolina at Columbia (Prisma Health Richland) in the Midlands of SC, the University of South Carolina at Greenville (Prisma Health Upstate) in the Upstate of SC, the Augusta University Medical Center in eastern Georgia, and Guilford Neurological Associates (Moses Cone Health) in western North Carolina. The greatest strength of this expanded network is our established partnerships in research and stroke care delivery, which has resulted in SE-CoAST emerging as one of the top recruiting Stroke Net RCCs overall. SE-CoAST has also been the #1 recruiting RCC in the Stroke Belt and the #1 recruiting RCC of Black subjects. SE-CoAST Investigators continue to make significant contributions to national Stroke Net activities, serving on Stroke Net national committees and in leadership roles for Stroke Net clinical trials. Additionally, the SE-CoAST training core has a proven track record of successful faculty development of a diverse group of Stroke Net Scholars.  Over the next 5 years, the goals of SE-CoAST are: 1) to leverage the SE-CoAST organization to accelerate trial start-up and increase recruitment and retention in Stroke Net trials while continuing to ensure high-quality data collection; 2) to make impactful contributions to the leadership of Stroke Net activities nationally; 3) Provide a fertile learning environment that includes strong mentorship and support to enhance the career development of our Stroke Net scholars. Our commitment to enrolling a diverse population of subjects from a highly stroke-prone region and the experience and leadership of our expanded multicenter team makes SE- CoAST a highly successful and valuable member of Stroke Net."
10795282,"Project Abstract – There is currently no evidence for an established treatment paradigm for
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The most recent clinical trials on hematoma evacuation and
iron chelator treatment have not shown a significant improvement in neurological function. No
objective surrogate markers of disease severity currently exist to guide prognosis. MRI is
inherently more informative about local tissue changes following hemorrhage in the brain tissue
than CT. We have recently completed our first translational MRI study (R21 - NS099684)
validating MRI based evaluation of iron overload in the brain tissue following ICH in 20 patients.
We have also demonstrated in another completed R21 (NS-104663) that proportional
erythrolysis within hematoma can be quantified reliably on MRI. Its influence on iron overload to
the surrounding tissue, perihematomal edema and white matter (WM) survival within the
hematoma can be robustly recorded in acute and subacute phases (7 – 10 days) and chronic
phase (up to 6 month). In addition, our preliminary data shows that the above markers have a
correlation with surviving WM within hematoma and the perihematomal region. The proposed
study aims to track natural history of ICH in terms of variations in above mentioned multiple MRI
markers, from acute (7-10 days) to the chronic phase (up to 6 months). It will particularly
address the importance of early erythrolysis on perihematomal iron overload and acute white
matter injury (day 7-10); the impact of hematomal and perihematomal iron overload on white
matter tract survival (days 7-10); and the effect of iron overload on white matter tract recovery
and brain atrophy after ICH (day 180). This study is important because this translational work
will establish MRI markers of iron mediated neurotoxicity and thus better inform future trials,
objectively evaluating newer treatment strategies including both image-guided mechanical
hematoma evacuation as well as pharmacological therapy for ICH."

prevalence rate of ~40% among teens and young adults. These percentages reflect the fact that STIs are a
major area of health disparity in the PICT as well as in other parts of the world. In the U.S., Hawaiian and other
Pacific Islanders have the 3rd highest prevalence of STIs, which is 3.7 times that of Whites. In these resource-
constrained regions, syndromic management of Ct is the norm. This is problematic because ~80% of females
and 50% of males are asymptomatic and do not seek medical care. Transmission from these asymptomatic yet
infected individuals to partners likely fuels the ongoing worldwide epidemic. Further, lack of treatment can
result in serious sequelae such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and hemorrhagic
proctitis. While the endocervix is considered the primary site of infection, female Ct rectal infections now
outnumber those in the urogenital tract. Without adequate detection, the rectum, which requires 7 to 21 days of
treatment with high rates of recurrence, is a potential reservoir of Ct for transmission within the host and to
partners. Our unifying hypothesis is that the natural history of Ct STIs is defined by the interaction of the
microbiomes, immune responses and pathogen populations of three key body sites: the vagina, endocervix
and rectum. We will employ metagenome shotgun sequencing (MSS) to understand healthy, dysbiotic and Ct-
associated microbiota in addition to host immune responses and Ct pathogen characteristics for a high-
incidence cohort of Fijian women. This work will naturally transition to improving future Ct diagnostics that
utilize metgenomic methods, and we will determine whether these data can predict protection from Ct and/or
incident Ct and infection severity. With prospective samples and clinical data collected prior to and at incident
Ct infection (or no Ct) from our cohort, we aim to: 1) identify taxonomic diversity, richness and abundance of
DNA-based organisms in the endocervix, vagina and rectum using MSS cross-referenced to 16S sequencing
at both time points; 2) quantitate immune responses in the context of the microbiota for each site, time point
and clinical outcome; 3) determine microbiota/immune response profiles that correlate with incident Ct genomic
strains and whether strain plays a role in clinical outcome at each site. Our research will aid in selecting
optimal sites for Ct screening and designing strategies such as vaginal and/or rectal therapy with beneficial
microbiota, especially for the latter site given the long and often ineffective treatment regimens. The steady
global increase in Ct cases necessitates research especially among those who suffer from health disparities
and are at increased risk for STIs. We have assembled a unique cohort of Fijian women with high rates of Ct
(up to 38%) without which it would not be possible to study the natural history of Ct urogenital and rectal STIs."

The CDC estimated that one-quarter of Americans living with HIV were over the age of 55 in 2012. By next
year, these individuals will be over age 60, entering into the age demographic where Alzheimer's disease (AD)
becomes a distinct differential for clinicians. Because up to one-half of people living with HIV experience
cognitive impairment from HIV or related factors, the likelihood for masking and thus delaying the diagnosis of
early AD is substantial. Differentiating HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) from the Mild Cognitive
Impairment stage of AD (MCI-AD) is one of the most pressing issues in geriatric neuroHIV. Current HAND
nosology does not provide guidance on this issue. Published work suggests the likelihood for distinct
phenotypes that would facilitate diagnostic sorting with commonly available inputs from neuropsychological
testing and structural imaging, but these may not be sufficient. Many studies highlight the importance of
myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages and microglia) in the pathogenesis of both HAND and AD. In this
application we propose to harness the power of epigenetics utilizing cell type specific signatures and cutting-
edge single cell technologies to define distinguishing and overlapping immune biomarkers of HAND from the
MCI-AD in individuals over 60 years of age. This application will test the hypothesis that a rare population of
circulating monocytes in blood defined by an indelible epigenetic profile related to the CNS are present in
HAND compared to age-matched cognitively normal HIV+ individuals over age 60 on suppressive anti-
retroviral therapy. We further posit that comprehensively defining this HAND-related monocyte cell type will aid
in distinguishing HAND from individuals with MCI-AD while also defining fundamental neuropathogenic
mechanisms of each disease. The specific aims are Aim 1: To examine monocyte epigenetic phenotypes
in individuals over 60 years with early MCI-AD compared to HAND and, separately, cognitively normal
age-matched HIV+ individuals on suppressive ART. Aim 2 To utilize single cell resolution technology
to interrogate unique monocyte subpopulation phenotypes that can be used to compare and contrast
with MCI-AD and HAND. Aim 3: To validate MCI-AD and HAND related signatures in primary monocytes
and define functional consequences of site-specific methylation events. Two major outcomes are
expected from the knowledge gained by this proposal: (1) to reveal biological pathways to understand the
pathogenesis of HAND and MCI-AD. and 2) address the challenges of distinguishing HAND from Mild
Cognitive Impairment due to AD in geriatric neuroHIV."

The central goal of this project is to identify the cellular mechanisms that underlie the mechanical
hypersensitivity and pain in Fabry Disease (FD), and thereby identify novel targets for improved pain treatment.
FD is the most common lysosomal storage disease. It results from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-
galactosidase A (α-Gal A) that leads to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids within the lysosomes of cells
including dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Small fiber neuropathy is a hallmark of FD. Neuropathic-like pain
begins around age 5, worsens with age, and affects 60-80% of all (male and female) patients. The pain is
described as episodic “pain crises” triggered by fever, exercise, fatigue or stress, and chronic “permanent
pain.” We created a transgenic rat model of FD using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete the gene encoding α-Gal A.
Fabry rats closely recapitulate many phenotypes observed in patients, including elevated serum levels of α-
galactosyl glycosphingolipids, spontaneous and mechanically-evoked pain behavior, pronounced lipid
inclusions and aberrant accumulation of α-galactosyl glycosphingolipids in small-diameter DRG neurons and
severe hearing loss. Sensory neurons somata from Fabry rats have sensitized rapidly adapting mechanical
currents and sensitized responses to mustard oil, suggesting that Piezo2 and TRPA1 channel activities may be
enhanced. Inhibition of TRPA1 alleviates the behavioral mechanical hypersensitivity in FD. Afferent fibers also
show clear spontaneous activity, which may underlie the ongoing pain. The Scientific Premise of this
proposal is that DRG sensory neurons in FD are dysfunctional and that the glycosphingolipids elevated in FD
sensitize Piezo2 and TRPA1 channels in sensory neurons, resulting in the mechanical hypersensitivity and
ongoing pain. This proposal will define the mechanisms that mediate Fabry disease pain in a top-down
approach through Aims that 1) define the stimulus evoked, ongoing, and crisis-evoked pain behavior over time
in male and female Fabry rats, 2) determine if the DRG is a key site for the generation and maintenance of
mechanical and ongoing pain, and 3) interrogate whether Piezo2 and/or TRPA1 ion channels mediate the
mechanical sensitization observed in the Fabry rat. In addition to identifying pain mechanisms that are FD-
specific, these studies will have a broader impact by identifying mechanisms that could advance the
understanding of mechanisms that underlie tactile allodynia and spontaneous pain in other types of
neuropathic disorders and uncover novel roles for lipids in mechanotransduction mechanisms in
somatosensory systems."
10924031,"ABSTRACT
Genetic variation in immune-related genes, as in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus, plays a pervasive
role across organ systems. HLA variation, called HLA alleles, is used to match organ donors, and has been
associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs), cancer, infections, and cardiovascular and neurologic diseases.
However, most studies focus on the impact of HLA variation on specific immune-mediated diseases; the broader
influence of HLA variation across all human disease has not been investigated in depth. The proposed research
program will address the challenge of identifying immunogenomic influence on a broad spectrum of diseases
and ADRs. Previous studies of HLA influence have almost exclusively focused on populations of European
descent, thus differences across ancestral groups are not well understood. The availability of the All of Us
Research Program (AoU), a large, diverse DNA biobank coupled to electronic health records (EHR) enables
investigation of how HLA alleles influence many diseases across multiple diverse populations simultaneously.
We propose to perform systematic investigation of the association of HLA alleles with disease, using a two
pronged approach based on the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). PheWAS is a disease-neutral
approach that identifies the association between genetic variation across a broad set of diseases. In Specific
Aim 1, HLA alleles will be determined using whole genome sequence data, and PheWAS will be deployed in
AllofUs to determine the influences of HLA alleles across organ systems, and to explore ancestral differences in
HLA associations. We will determine association of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ alleles with a comprehensive
set of diseases within and across major ancestry groups in AoU. Despite its power, PheWAS analysis is limited
to identifying single-allele connections to phenotypes of interest, so influences that result from HLA interactions
(either combinations of HLA alleles, or between an HLA gene and some other genomic context) may be missed.
Specific Aim 2 will address this shortcoming – we will develop Machine Learning strategies to explore the effect
of HLA allele interactions on disease, and explore the potential for recognizing pleiotropic influences of HLA
alleles. This innovative PheWAS-based approach has the potential to discover novel mechanisms of many
diseases, identify biomarkers that may predict disease, and create a roadmap by which future researchers
investigate the impact of HLA variation in human disease. As indicated by our previous work, PheWAS has the
potential to condense decades of immunogenomic discoveries into a single analysis. When applied to under-
studied, diverse populations, this work has the potential to accelerate this field of research. This approach can
be applied to many other genomic loci, differential associations by other characteristics such as sex and/or
gender, and identification of pleiotropic effects across disease systems, creating a number of potentially fruitful
avenues of future research."
10799657,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The key appeal of polygenic risk scores (PRS) is the provision of individual-level estimates of genetic liability to
complex disease. These proxies of genetic liability enable a raft of applications across clinical and basic research
settings. However, while PRS are set to play a pivotal role in the future of biomedical research, their present
formulation is suboptimal since it fails to directly account for substructure in genetic disease risk.
The overarching goal of our proposal is to introduce a new generation of pathway-specific PRS, informed by
biological function. Rather a single genome-wide PRS for each individual, they will have a set of k PRS over k
pathways. Pathways will be defined according to multiscale integration of ‘omics data, exploiting co-expression
networks, the transcriptome and the epigenome. The key deliverable from this project will be the production of a
powerful and comprehensive pathway-specific PRS computational tool, PRSet, informed by biological function.
The rationale is that PRS calculated for individuals by aggregating the effects of all risk variants genome-wide,
results in a loss of vital individual-level information. Providing pathway-specific estimates of genetic liability,
computed in a scalable, statistically rigorous way, informed by latest multi-omic data, could enable researchers
to better decompose heterogenous complex disease, identify key pathways that explain overlap or
differences among disorders, and explain problems of portability of PRS between and within populations.
Applying our pathway-specific PRS tool, we seek to stratify patients into more homogenous subgroups by their
liability over key pathways. We will use PRSet for stratification in three ways: (i) stratifying within SCZ/BiP, testing
if liability over different pathways forms multiple routes to disease, (ii) differentiating between SCZ and BiP, testing
if key pathways differentiate these highly overlapping disorders, (iii) testing whether variation in treatment
response can be explained by pathway liability. Such stratification could help explain past successes, failures
and adverse-effects in clinical trials, and provide new therapeutic targets tailored to subsets of patients.
Our proposal is significant because the burgeoning application of PRS means that any advance in the PRS
approach will have immediate, high impact across psychiatric research. Pathway-specific PRS could open-up
routes to hypotheses that cannot be answered by genome-wide PRS. If PRSet reveals that genetic liability is
more stratified than presently modelled, then this would call for a focus on pathways and their multi-omic
integration, paving a new path towards precision medicine.
Our proposal is innovative because we develop the first pathway-specific, function-informed, PRS tool, we
propose that disease risk may be influenced by multiple genetic liabilities, and we stratify patients according to
pathway-specific genetic risk for the first time.
In conclusion, our proposal delivers a tool for the field to perform powerful pathway PRS analyses, better
understand genetic liability to disease, and which may offer a more direct route to precision medicine."

 Metabolic transformation is a hallmark feature of cancer cells that allows sustained anabolic metabolism to
fuel cell growth and proliferation, and when distilled to its core, cancer is ultimately a disease of unchecked
anabolic metabolism. Yet, it is not well understood how the aberrant metabolic activity of tumor cells affects the
function, phenotype and metabolic states of neighboring immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. The
development of new immunotherapies that stimulate anti-tumor T cell responses to control or eradicate cancer
is a revolutionary and promising area of cancer therapy, but the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor
microenvironment remains the biggest obstacle to increasing the frequency of patients that respond to
immunotherapy. We propose that a major component dictating whether the tumor microenvironment (TME) is
immuno-supportive or immuno-suppressive is the metabolic state of tumor cells. This model is based on the fact
that, like tumor cells, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) also require high rates of aerobic glycolysis and
glutaminolysis to proliferate and perform tumoricidal effector functions. It is well documented that CD8+ T cells
are functionally suppressed or “exhausted” in tumors and perhaps a primary source of this suppression is simply
nutrient deprivation stemming from competition between metabolically active tumor and immune cells for the
same nutrients. This model of a “metabolic tug-of-war” between tumor and immune cells over nutrients such as
glucose and glutamine presents an entirely different perspective on how an immunosuppressive TME may form.
 To bridge this gap in cancer immunology, we will determine how metabolic pathways, particularly those
involved in lipid homeostasis, utilized by melanoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) affect the
quality and function of infiltrating immune cells. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will investigate the balance between
lipogenesis and lipolysis in tumor cells to determine how this affects the composition of lipids and lipoproteins in
the TME and the types of TILs present. We will test if CD8+ TILs metabolically adapt to changes in tumor cell
metabolism and learn how this affects their anti-tumor immune response. In Aim 2, we will investigate if TILs
respond to hyperlipidemia and Ox-LDL in the TME via upregulation of the transporter CD36 and elucidate how
Ox-LDL-CD36 signaling suppresses CD8+ TIL effector functions (this work is the first to explore this pathway in
CD8+ T cells to our knowledge). Lastly, we found arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism correlates with TIL infiltration
and in Aim 3 we will explore a new model that the balance of PGD2 and PGE2 changes as tumors progress,
converting an immuno-supportive TME to one that is more immuno-suppressive. In all three Aims we will target
these metabolic pathways to discover novel combinations of therapies that enhance the efficacy of
immunotherapies currently in clinical use today. This work has great potential to uncover several new dimensions
of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and interventions to stimulate anti-tumor immunity."
10799659,"Breastfeeding reduces the mother’s risk of type 2 diabetes and protects the child from obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. Unfortunately, mothers with obesity and type 2 diabetes often have insufficient milk production. Lactation by the breast tissue is accomplished through a serious of complicated cellular remodeling, and a “reverse” remodeling post-weaning takes place to return the breast tissue to the non-lactating state (involution). Our understanding of how breast tissue remodels during and post-weaning is limited, which impedes our ability to address lactation complications. The human breast (mammary gland) is comprised of glandular, ductal, connective, and adipose tissue; in the non-lactating mammary gland, the majority of the mass is made up of adipose tissue. My lab recently showed that during lactation, mammary adipocytes undergo a process of dedifferentiation to become adipocyte precursor-like cells; during involution, these dedifferentiated cells can proliferate, and re-differentiate back into adipocytes. Thus, for the first time, we discovered that terminally differentiated mature adipocytes can dedifferentiate, go back to cell cycle, and regain the capacity of self-renewal. Our objective for this proposal is to determine what regulate mammary adipocytes dedifferentiation during lactation, and to define the role of mammary adipocyte dedifferentiation and regeneration during lactation and involution. Our new preliminary data indicate that mammary adipocytes dedifferentiation is due to paracrine stimulation, and Wnt signaling is the top candidate that regulate this process. We also showed that short-term high fat diet feeding leads to incomplete mammary adipocyte dedifferentiation and smaller mammary alveolar structure. Furthermore, inhibiting the regeneration of mammary adipocytes leads to severely delayed mammary gland involution, persistent alveologenesis, periductal fibrosis, and milk retention. We hypothesize that mammary adipocyte dedifferentiation is regulated by paracrine factors from the mammary epithelial cells, especially Wnt signaling, and successful mammary adipocyte dedifferentiation and regeneration are essential for mammary lactation and involution. We will test our hypothesis in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms that regulate adipocyte dedifferentiation during lactation, focusing on Wnt signaling, as well as identifying new paracrine factors. In Aim 2, we will define the role of mammary adipocyte dedifferentiation in mammary alveologenesis and lactogenesis. Specifically, we will determine if incomplete adipocyte dedifferentiation is directly correlated with impaired mammary alveologenesis and lactogenesis. In Aim 3, we will define the role of mammary adipocyte regeneration in mammary gland involution. Our findings will provide fundamental knowledge to the fields of both adipose and mammary gland biology. We will also provide novel insights into lactation and involution complications in women with metabolic disorders. Moreover, the underlying mechanism of mature adipocyte dedifferentiation will bring new strategies for the treatment of obesity."

Activation of E2F transcription factors is the most downstream event in the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) tumor
suppressor pathway, which controls entry into the cell cycle and proliferation. E2F stimulates expression of
genes needed for DNA synthesis during S phase and for further progression into mitosis. Inactivation of Rb
and aberrant activation of the E2F-controlled transcription program is a hallmark of cancer. While Rb
repression of E2F has been extensively characterized, little is known regarding how E2F activates transcription
and how additional regulatory mechanisms control E2F function. Here we explore the structural mechanisms
underlying the function and posttranslational regulation of E2F.
Our first aim is to determine how E2F associates with chromatin and influences chromatin architecture to
induce gene expression. We will use structural, biochemical, and cellular assays to investigate how E2F binds
nucleosomes and how those interactions are critical for modulating chromatin architecture as cells activate the
transcription program for S phase entry. Our second aim is to identify novel E2F posttranslational modifications
and how modifications including phosphorylation and acetylation modulate E2F association with chromatin and
co-activator proteins. Our third aim is to reveal how E2F proteins are recognized by the E3 ligase adaptor
protein Cyclin F (CycF) for ubiquitylation and degradation. A structural and cell biology approach will be
applied to define the CycF-binding motif, and we will test the hypothesis that chemical inhibition of CycF can
deregulate the cell cycle in model cancer cells.
In collaboration with the other program projects and cores, our study will provide unprecedented molecular
analysis of E2F function and regulation. Our experimental results will provide foundational knowledge that can
be applied to design new therapeutic strategies that target E2F activity in diverse cancers."

The overarching goal of this candidate’s program of research is to overcome social and environmental barriers
to promote behavior change and cardiovascular health equity. The focus on this application is low-income,
rural patients, since cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence is 40% higher among rural than urban residents.
Health behavior counseling and follow-up care are required for patients with an elevated body mass index who
have increased risk for CVD. Counseling is most effective when developed with, and tailored to, the patient
and offered with resources that support healthy food intake and physical activity. Resource referral and follow-
up is particularly important in rural low income residents who often have more severe social needs that impede
healthy behaviors. The proposed research will leverage the candidate’s digital health tool (PREVENT) for
healthcare teams to use within the clinic visit. PREVENT visually displays patient-reported and electronic
health record (EHR) data to facilitate counseling and deliver tailored physical activity and healthy food intake
goals and resources. PREVENT may improve the quality of required care and promote cardiovascular health
equity. A K12 award enabled the candidate to show that PREVENT is feasible in urban clinics. This research
will build upon her K12 work to: 1) collaborate with rural and clinic partners to modify and integrate the
PREVENT tool for low-income, rural patients with obesity (Aim 1); and 2) conduct a pilot pragmatic clinical trial
of PREVENT to optimize feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and potential health equity impact. To
achieve the goals of this research and transition to independence, the candidate requires further training in: 1)
rural health and health equity; 2) advanced dissemination and implementation science; 3) design and conduct
of pragmatic clinical trials; and 4) team management and leadership. Together, the exceptional mentors,
internal and external advisors, and institution are committed to assisting the candidate to reach her career
development goals and to conduct the proposed research. In summary, this award will build the foundation for
the candidate’s career as an independent investigator by providing: 1) the skillset to use dissemination and
implementation science and health equity research methods to tailor and equitably implement technology
interventions; 2) methodologic and leadership skills to conduct pragmatic clinical trials; 3) a multilevel, scalable
program for improving the quality of health behavior counseling; and 4) the pilot data to support the feasibility
of a subsequent R01 trial of PREVENT in multiple clinic settings."

The overarching goal of the UM Behavioral Medicine and Sleep Disorders (BSM) Institute is to continue
building capacity to address a critical deficiency in the academic workforce. This will be achieved by
providing congruent mentored learning experience to an additional cadre of URM faculty pursuing careers in
cardiovascular risk reduction via implementation of innovative, translational behavioral models. The Institute
commences with a 2-week didactic program (Summer I), followed by year-long consultation with a
Mentorship Team, monthly webinars, a mid-year meeting to present work in progress and scientific findings,
and ending with a 1-week program (Summer II). The initial 2-week didactic sessions focus on methodology,
biostatistics, methods ensuring proper ethical conduct and reproducibility, behavioral medicine and sleep
disorders topics, and intensive grant-writing workshops. The 1-week follow-up program provides mentees
with opportunities for one-on-one interactions with NHLBI staff; participation in NIH Mock Study Section;
and peer proposal critiques. In partnership with distinguished investigators at the University of Miami, Mount
Sinai, and NHLBI staff, we will implement and evaluate the BSM curriculum throughout the 5-year period.
Together with the Coordination Core (CC), we will apply our web-based evaluation protocol to assess
effectiveness of the Institute and to track mentees’ progress for 5 years post completion. Outcomes
include: 1) number of professional presentations and peer-reviewed publications; 2) leadership positions; 3)
career awards; and 4) federal and non-federal grants. Mentees’ characteristics predicting academic success
will be measured pre and post enrollment. The specific aims are: 1) to select qualified junior URM faculty
with potential to contribute to current knowledge of behavioral and biomedical models used to reduce risk of
CV-related diseases; 2) to increase mentees’ self-efficacy to pursue a BSM career, achieved via active
coaching to realize their Individual Development Plan and acquisition of expertise in applying translational
behavioral tools; 3) to work with the CC to submit and administer the Small Research Project; 4) to provide
congruent mentorship to mentees, enabling their transition into independent investigators; 5) to provide
mentees with intensive individualized training and guidance in grant writing using NIH review criteria; and 6)
to evaluate effectiveness of the Institute ensuring milestones are achieved in a timely manner. The Co-
Directors will work directly with the CC to execute BSM’s programmatic activities, implement program
evaluation plan, monitor mentees’ progress during enrollment, and tracking mentees’ academic
achievements. Successful completion of this renewed Institute will establish a network of 48 well-trained
URM faculty, applying novel, evidence-based methods to improve health equity in minoritized communities."

AD/ADRD are highly complex diseases characterized by distinct molecular pathways and neuropathological
phenotypes. Unfortunately, the treatment remains at best modestly effective and no new drugs have been
approved since 2003. Combinatorial drug therapy for AD/ADRD treatment has not been intensively studied but
it is highly promising. We hypothesize that finding repositioned drug combinations through innovative
exploration of big data may uncover effective AD/ADRD treatments, with implicit advantages in overcoming
drug resistance and targeting multiple biomarkers. We will combine big biomedical data from complementary
sources, novel and advanced informatics models, clinical domain expertise, as well as biology knowledge and
validation into a coherent framework to tackle AD/ADRD with potential combinatorial drug therapies. In an
exponentially larger and more challenging space of combinatorial drug therapy, opportunities are also
exponentially larger when compared with traditional single-drug models but many computational challenges
need to be carefully handled. We will develop multiple computational models under two philosophical
umbrellas, with focuses on quantifiable screening and biological understanding. Our findings will be validated
with biological experiments from cell to mouse. If successful, we will significantly advance AD/ADRD research
and benefit patients with safe and effective treatment."
10807372,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that
affects approximately 2.5 million people worldwide. US military personnel are at special risk to develop MS:
the incidence rate in the US military population (12.9 per 100,000 person-years) is 1.7x higher than the civilian
population, and 3x higher than the global population. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a
widely studied animal model that shares many features of human MS. Tissue injury in EAE and MS is caused
by inflammatory leukocytes that enter the CNS and destroy myelin. CNS-infiltrating, myelin-reactive CD4+ T
cells play key roles in the pathology of MS. Although a number of MS treatments are available, due to the
heterogeneity of the MS disease process, individual patient responses, and medication toxicities, there is a
substantial unmet clinical need for improved therapeutics.
 Leukocyte differentiation and function is profoundly affected by the engagement of metabolic pathways for
lipid or retinoid processing. Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase-1 (DGAT1) is a metabolic enzyme that can
catalyze the synthesis of triglycerides (via DGAT activity), and retinyl esters (via acyl CoA:retinol
acyltransferase (ARAT) activity). Little is known regarding the role of DGAT1 in leukocyte biology. We
published that DGAT1 is selectively upregulated in activated mouse CD4+ T cells both in vitro and in vivo
during EAE. DGAT1 is selectively expressed in brain lesions and CD4+ blood T cells obtained from MS
patients. Both conventional DGAT1 KO mice and mice we generated with CD4+ T cell-selective deficiency in
DGAT1 (tamoxifen-treated CD4CreERT2+/-DGAT1fl/fl) were protected against EAE and histological CNS
inflammation and demyelination. Furthermore, DGAT1 pharmaco-inhibition can be used therapeutically to
improve clinical EAE. Our preliminary studies indicate that genetic deficiency in DGAT1 leads to increased
regulatory T cell (Treg) numbers and frequency; that polyfunctional Treg proliferation is enhanced in vitro in
DGAT1 KO cells; and that suppressor activity is increased in DGAT1 KO Treg from normal and EAE mice. We
therefore hypothesize that DGAT1 serves as a novel immune checkpoint for Treg that can be targeted to
enhance Treg proliferation and activity to combat MS.
 In Aim 1, we propose to investigate if DGAT1 small molecule antagonists enhance human and mouse
regulatory T cell proliferation/suppressor activity and extend remission in the relapsing-remitting PLP-SJL EAE
model. Notably, DGAT1 inhibitors are already being tested in clinical trials for treatment of obesity-associated
diseases. Thus, the studies outlined in Aim 1 have the potential to prompt swift repurposing of existing, safe,
well-characterized DGAT1 inhibitors and offer real translational opportunities to improve the lives of Veterans
and other patients with MS. In Aim 2, we will define the role of DGAT1 in regulatory T cell trafficking to the
CNS during demyelinating disease. Our preliminary data indicates that chemokine receptor CCR6 is
upregulated in DGAT1-deficient Tregs, which we hypothesize contributes to their increased frequency in the
CNS during EAE. We will use CCR6 KO mice to ask if CCR6-dependent Treg trafficking to the CNS is
required for the protective effects of DGAT1 inhibitor in EAE. We also propose to use transcriptomic profiling
to compare gene expression signatures of CNS Treg from DGAT1 KO vs. WT EAE mice to identify additional
differentially-expressed trafficking receptors and regulatory pathways impacted by DGAT1. In Aim 3, we will
use conditional DGAT1-deficient mice to define the role of DGAT1 in CD4+ T cells, regulatory T cells, and
neutrophils in clinical EAE and CNS histological inflammation and demyelination. The bulk of our preliminary
data clearly points to a major pathogenic role for DGAT1 in CD4+ T cells and Tregs in EAE. In new
preliminary data, we also uncovered high expression of DGAT1 in neutrophils along with alterations in
neutrophil abundance during EAE. Neutrophils are known to contribute to EAE pathogenesis."

Adoptive cellular therapies (ACT) such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy are complex treatments for
patients with hematologic malignancies. Patients receiving ACT can experience life-threatening toxicities, which
result in tremendous symptom burden and creates substantial burden for their caregivers. Moreover, patients
receiving ACT experience intense healthcare utilization at the end of life (EOL) with 50% dying in the hospital.
Thus, interventions are needed to optimize the quality of life (QOL) and EOL care for patients receiving ACT and
improve the QOL of their caregivers. Prior studies have shown that involving specialty palliative care (PC)
clinicians in the care of patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies improves a wide range of
outcomes for patients and their caregivers. Yet PC clinicians are rarely consulted in the care of patients receiving
ACT. Furthermore, these patients have unique needs and illness trajectory and prior PC interventions in
oncology are not tailored for this population. We recently completed a longitudinal study to comprehensively
delineate the needs of patients receiving ACT and utilized these data to develop a PC intervention (PEACE)
tailored to this population. This proposal details a five-year plan to refine and pilot test PEACE to address the
unmet needs of patients receiving ACT and their caregivers. Specifically, the aims of this project are to 1) refine
PEACE based on findings from an open pilot study (N=15) of patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing
ACT and their caregivers; 2) determine the feasibility and acceptability of PEACE by conducting a pilot
randomized controlled trial (RCT) (N = 80), and 3) explore the preliminary effects of PEACE for improving the
QOL, physical and psychological symptoms, prognostic understanding, and EOL communication of patients
receiving ACT and the QOL, psychological symptoms, and prognostic understanding of their caregivers. This
work will lay the foundation to demonstrate the role of PC for improving the quality of care and lived experience
of patients receiving ACT.
This proposal also details the plans of the candidate, Dr. P. Connor Johnson, a medical oncologist physician-
investigator specializing in ACT, to gain mentorship, didactic training, and career development to facilitate his
transition to research independence. Dr. Johnson’s long-term career goal is to become a leader in supportive
care oncology research, specializing in developing and evaluating interventions to improve the QOL and care of
patients receiving ACT. This proposal includes Dr. Johnson’s plans for gaining expertise in 1) refining and testing
supportive care interventions; 2) adapting PC interventions to the unique needs of patients receiving ACT and
their caregivers; and 3) conducting and evaluating outcomes in supportive care clinical trials. He will achieve this
training through experiential learning leading the proposed project with guidance from his mentor Dr. Areej El-
Jawahri, a leading expert in PC research, and a scientific advisory team with expertise in PC research, qualitative
research methods, ACT clinical care and research, EOL communication, monitoring intervention fidelity, and
RCT outcome evaluation. He will gain additional skills through coursework in PC and RCT design and conduct.
This project will position Dr. Johnson to compete for R01-level funding and launch an independent career leading
a research program at the interface of supportive care and ACT."

Fungal infections, particularly Candida albicans (Ca), have a high worldwide disease burden and mortality rate.
Unfortunately, antifungal resistance is rising in this pathogen, necessitating the search for alternative treatment
modes. Ca can exist in the gut of healthy individuals without causing disease, but can also switch into a
pathogenic form. Key drivers of Ca virulence include hyphal growth and biofilm formation that is enforced by its
mating pheromone, α-factor. Unfortunately, biofilm formation also reduces the efficacy of antifungal drugs.
Therefore, drugs that inhibit the ability of C. albicans to form biofilms in the gut may synergize with currently
available therapies to treat Candida infections. Excitingly, Ca biofilms can be inhibited with synthetic peptides
or biofilm-degrading enzymes. However, because protein drugs are susceptible to degradation in the gut,
delivery of these drugs remains a challenge. Targeted delivery strategies such as liposomes or nano-lipid
carriers are promising candidates for this purpose, but release their therapeutic cargo in response to rather
crude signals (e.g. mucus or pH) which are relatively uniform in the large intestine.
Engineered probiotic microbes are a promising vehicle for delivery of protein drugs into the large intestine.
Recent advances in our ability to engineer non-model microbes, as well as an increased understanding of the
gut microbiota, have led to a renewed focus in these therapies. Engineered probiotics achieve site-specific
protein delivery due to the ability to sense highly specific extracellular cues (e.g. peptide hormones), localize to
defined regions of the gut by displaying adhesins on their surface, and secreting recombinant proteins
extracellularly. For the purposes of treating Ca biofilms, the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb) is
particularly promising because of its high secretion rates, ability to easily display recombinant proteins on its
cell surface, and its ability to express receptors for the Ca mating pheromone. In this study, we will develop
strains of probiotic yeast that can bind to Ca biofilms, secrete biofilm-inhibiting proteins, and sense peptides
secreted by Ca during biofilm formation. In doing so, we will generate a lead live biotherapeutic against Ca
biofilms that is ready for testing in preclinical models of gut-derived candidiasis."
10813791,"This research aims to understand age-related temporal processing in older cochlear-implant (CI) users. The gap
in knowledge is that critical measurements and comparisons have been unavailable to disentangle peripheral
from central factors that impact CI performance. The long-term goals of this grant are to (1) understand the
biological effects of auditory aging and (2) determine how to best remediate age-related auditory deficits with a
CI. The overall objective of this application, which is the next step toward attainment of our long-term goals, is to
disentangle the peripheral and central contributions to age-related temporal processing deficits in CI users. Our
central hypothesis is that age-related speech perception deficits are explained by unique contributions from pe-
ripheral and central auditory functions, which significantly affect outcomes in older CI users. The rationale is that
CIs are uniquely suited to disentangle peripheral vs central contributions of age-related temporal processing
deficits because they can bypass or easily characterize peripheral contributions to hearing, making an ideal
system for auditory aging research. We plan to test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific
aims: (1) Determine the extent to which temporal processing from single-electrode stimulation can be explained
by aging and the peripheral electrode-to-neural interface in CI subjects; (2) Determine the extent to which speech
perception can be explained by aging and the peripheral electrode-to-neural interface in CI subjects; (3) Deter-
mine the extent and manner in which central auditory compensation overcomes peripheral processing deficits
that contribute to age-related performance declines in CI subjects. These aims will yield the following expected
outcomes. First, we will understand how aging and ENI correlate with each other, and how well peripheral con-
tributions explain simple single-electrode temporal-processing performance. Second, we will understand if pe-
ripheral contributions play a smaller role in explaining speech perception performance using multi-electrode stim-
ulation, relative to perception of simple signals presented to single electrodes. Third, we will ascertain if age-
related central processing deficits contribute above and beyond the peripheral deficits for processing of both
simple and complex acoustic signals (including speech) among CI listeners. The proposed research is significant
because expanding our understanding of the locus of the age-related temporal processing deficits will help de-
velop age-specific guidance to CI candidacy, approaches to CI programming, and CI rehabilitation, improving
an older CI user’s performance and quality of life. The proposed research is innovative because CIs offer a
unique ability to bypass and characterize the periphery, allowing us to disentangle peripheral vs central mecha-
nisms that contribute to age-related hearing deficits."

In the US there are >700,000 new heart attacks (acute myocardial infarctions) a year, and >300,000 patients
undergo scheduled ischemia during cardiac surgery. Beyond tissue reperfusion (angioplasty, thrombolysis)
there are no FDA-approved interventions to limit acute cardiac injury due to ischemia and reperfusion (IR). This
renewal proposal supports our ongoing research program in cardiac metabolism, and is focused on novel
cardioprotective metabolic signaling events downstream of glycolysis. It is built on the following premise: (i)
Acidic pH during IR is cardioprotective, and many therapies that boost glycolysis work in-part by enhancing
metabolic acidosis. (ii) Succinate accumulation is a key event in ischemia, and its oxidation at reperfusion
drives reactive oxygen species generation. We propose acid can regulate succinate dynamics (accumulation,
oxidation, transport). (iii) The glycolytic byproduct methylglyoxal (MGO) causes glycative stress in diabetes, but
type-I diabetic hearts are acutely protected against IR injury, and MGO inhibits the mitochondrial permeability
transition (PT) pore, a key event in IR injury. Some cardioprotective interventions also elevate MGO. (iv) The
mitochondrial enzyme ALKBH7 is necessary for necrosis. Inhibition or ablation of ALKBH7 is cardioprotective,
and this protection requires the MGO metabolizing enzyme GLO-1. Based on these published and preliminary
findings, our central hypothesis is that the cardioprotective effects of elevated glycolysis are mediated
by pH, succinate, and MGO. This hypothesis will be tested by addressing 3 related aims… Aim 1 will
investigate succinate dynamics in IR injury and the impact of pH. Aim 2 will investigate the role of MGO as an
acute cardioprotective signal, including identifying its targets in mitochondria. Aim 3 will study ALKBH7, identify
its substrates, and develop ALKBH7 inhibitors as cardioprotective drugs. The aims will use established
experimental systems (adult cardiomyocytes, perfused hearts, LC-MS based metabolomics, in-vivo IR injury,
and a high-fat diet model of diabetes) and engineered mice including Alkbh7-/-, Glo1-/- and hGlo1TG. Innovation
is embedded in the idea that MGO can serve an acute protective signaling role separate from its well-known
chronic pathologic effects (i.e. hormesis). This work will advance basic knowledge on ischemic cardiac
metabolism, will develop small molecule therapeutics, and will offer mechanistic insights to other pathologies
beyond IR."
10813729,"SUMMARY
Genomic analyses of thousands of MDS patients has established that mutations in RNA splicing factors are
the most common class of genetic alterations in patients with MDS. In parallel, functional studies have
revealed that several of these genetic lesions appear to drive aberrant hematopoietic self-renewal and
differentiation that is characteristic of MDS. Specifically, mutations in splicing factor 3b subunit 1(SF3B1), a
core spliceosome component, are among the most common in patients with MDS and lead to incorrect intronic
branch point recognition. Despite these advances, our knowledge of the effects of this genetic alteration on
downstream gene expression programs within actual disease initiating cells has been hampered by the
coexistence of normal wildtype hematopoiesis together with the aberrant clone harboring somatic driver
mutations. While some of these limitations are now beginning to be addressed with single cell genomics,
performing a layered genomic analysis to simultaneously capture somatic mutations, gene expression, RNA
splicing, and chromatin state in single cells has never been performed. Expression of RNA-binding proteins is
in turn cell type dependent, necessitating the simultaneously profiling of gene expression, full-length cDNA and
SF3B1 mutational status at the single cell level, allowing splicing to be examined in the proper cellular context.
To address this challenge, we developed an array of multi-omic single-cell technologies that are capable of
capturing multiple layers of information (e.g., genotypes, transcriptomes, methylomes, protein expression) from
the same single cells. Moreover, we addressed the specific challenge of genotyping in scRNA-seq in single
cells at high throughput by developing Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT). Importantly, GoT turns the
admixture of mutant and wildtype hematopoiesis from a limitation to an advantage, enabling the direct
comparison of mutant and wildtype cells within the same individual.
Capitalizing on a unique cohort of bone marrow samples from individuals with MDS and CH, we now aim to
apply and extend the multi-omics single-cell toolkit to test define how SF3B1 somatic mutations lead to clonal
growth advantage. First, we will perform GoT across MDS and CH samples with canonical SF3B1 driver
mutations. We will integrate GoT with Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-
seq) (GoT-CITE), to add the critical layer of cell surface markers to single-cell whole transcriptomes. Second,
mutations in splicing factors are specifically associated with greater risk of transformation in CH. Therefore, we
will develop and implement GoT-Splice, where long-read sequencing will be used to define splicing variation
as a function of cell identity. Third, given the high importance of epigenetic patterning to hematopoietic stem
cell identity, we will develop and apply targeted single-cell genotyping in the context of chromatin accessibility
(GoT-ChA). This will allow us to unravel the regulatory underpinnings of SF3B1-driven CH and MDS."
10813731,"PROJECT SUMMARY
From initial diagnosis through treatment and into survivorship, patients frequently report fatigue as a significant
problem. Studies suggest that up to 90% of cancer patients experience moderate to severe fatigue during
treatment and nearly 30% after treatment completion. Fatigue pathophysiology is thought to be multifactorial and
complex, including host susceptibility, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, disruption in circadian rhythms of
sleep/activity patterns, and neuroendocrine and metabolic dysregulation. However, to date most studies
examining the biology of cancer-related fatigue have limited their focus to inflammation. We propose a new
approach, the Predisposing, Precipitating, and Perpetuating (3P) model, to comprehensively examine cancer-
related fatigue pathophysiology. The 3P model hypothesizes that: (1) genetic variants predispose patients to
fatigue, (2) inflammation and metabolic dysregulation caused by cancer and its treatment are precipitating
factors, and (3) behaviors such as poor diet, physical inactivity, and sleep disruption perpetuate the problem. In
the current study, we will use a metabolomics approach, the study of small molecules, to examine the relative
contributions of precipitating endogenous metabolism and cytokines as well as perpetuating behavioral factors
to fatigue pathophysiology, and how these are modified by predisposing genetic variants and other factors. This
approach offers an exciting opportunity to interrogate cancer-related fatigue at a multi-omics systems level. To
our knowledge, cancer-related fatigue has never been studied in the context of the metabolome. We will leverage
detailed clinical, epidemiological, and objective and subjective behavioral data as well as blood samples obtained
at diagnosis/surgery and sequentially up to 2-years post-diagnosis from the ColoCare Study, a large,
international, multi-site, prospective colorectal cancer (CRC) survivor cohort (n=2,379) to determine and validate
predictors of fatigue. The ColoCare study is the only large cohort study that collects such comprehensive
biological and behavioral data in the context of CRC. The study has three aims. In Aim 1, we will examine
genomic variation and other baseline characteristics as predisposing factors for cancer-related fatigue. In Aim 2,
we will examine the metabolome and inflammasome as precipitating factors for cancer-related fatigue. In Aim 3,
we will conduct an integrative analysis to evaluate sleep, physical activity, diet, and their relationships with the
genome, metabolome and inflammasome as perpetuating factors for cancer-related fatigue. This study is unique
in using the 3P framework, detailed longitudinal evaluation of fatigue, and use of cutting-edge technologies to
measure multi-omic and behavioral changes over time. Results will provide new avenues for risk prediction,
prevention, and treatment of cancer-related fatigue."

Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1D) is an autoimmune disease targeting pancreatic β-cells that affects over 8 million
people worldwide. Standard treatment for T1D is limited to administration of exogenous insulin, which can result
in hypoglycemic episodes, and fails to fully prevent micro- and macro- vascular complications. Thus, deriving
glucose-responsive insulin-producing β-cells from renewable sources is an index goal of regenerative medicine.
Yet, current human stem cell-derived β-cells produce insulin at lower levels than native β-cells and fail to
recapitulate regulated insulin secretion typical of mature adult islet β-cells. This limits their therapeutic potential
and reflects a significant gap in our knowledge regarding mechanisms regulating human islet maturation. Exciting
recent studies identified human-specific age-dependent gene expression changes, including novel transcription
factors, such as RXRG, not expressed in mouse or immature human β-like cells, that might control functional
maturation of human islet cells. My Preliminary Data shows that RXRG loss in human adult β-cells results in
impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Recent studies also showed that gradual turnover of enhancers
drives lineage progression and maturation. I have found a presumptive enhancer regulatory element of RXRG
that becomes differentially accessible with age in adult β-cells compared to immature β-cells and a-cells, as
measured by H3K27Ac occupancy. My objective here is to discover mechanisms that induce maturation of
human β-cells, using two approaches. In Aim 1, I will investigate the regulatory roles of the novel
transcriptional regulator of β-cell maturation RXRG. This will involve knock down of RXRG, and then β-cell
specific RNA-seq and CUT&RUN to identify RXRG downstream targets. In addition, I will activate RXRG
endogenous promoter using the CRISPRa system and evaluate chromatin accessibility changes induced by
activation of this maturation-required transcription factor. In Aim 2, I will study the non-coding regulatory
mechanisms activating RXRG expression to induce β-cell maturation. Since these mechanisms do not occur
in mouse or stem cell-derived human β-cells, and are specific to adult β-cells, the studies I proposed will be
performed in adult human islets using the pseudoislet-genetics platform I developed during my postdoctoral
studies. Here, I will use novel technological advancements, including CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
editing of human islet cells, to delete the presumptive enhancer element of RXRG and evaluate its role in
regulating RXRG expression. Finally, I will activate RXRG expression in juvenile islets using CRISPRa to activate
RXRG promoter, enhancer or both, and evaluate if RXRG expression enhances coordinated glucose-dependent
insulin secretion in adulthood. Altogether, findings from this proposal will uncover novel pathways leading to β-
cell maturation, that could be exploited towards efforts with β-cells from renewable sources. Equally importantly,
these studies provide a novel toolkit for genetically manipulating previously “unstudiable” or inaccessible non-
replicating mature and immature β-cells."

 Our long-term goal is to accurately identify who is at risk of decline in driving, to forecast when decline
will occur, and to intervene before decline, thereby reducing the numbers of crashes, injuries, and death in
older adults. Our findings indicate that the long preclinical stage of Alzheimer disease (AD), as reflected in
amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers among cognitively normal persons, is associated
with poorer driving performance on a standardized road test. This project will assess how depression,
preclinical AD, and antidepressants affect driving behavior in cognitively normal older adults (≥ 65 years).
 This research is significant because 36 million licensed drivers are aged 65 years or older, and the
number of older adults in the United States is expected to double by 2050, when 1 in 4 drivers will be 65 years
or older. Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of injury and death in older adults (814 daily crashes).
Driving is a cognitively demanding and highly dynamic activity. Depression and symptomatic AD independently
increase the risk of an automobile crash. Depression is also a factor for conversion to symptomatic AD, yet it is
often used as an exclusion criterion for aging studies. The adverse impact of depression and antidepressant
use on driving, and the impact of depression on AD is documented; yet an understanding of the synergy
between these three areas is lacking.
 Our Specific Aims will (1) characterize the relationship between major depression (diagnosis) and
naturalistic driving behavior in a prospective, longitudinal study, (2) examine whether major depression and
preclinical AD, combined, predict faster longitudinal change in driving behavior among older adults, (3) assess
the impact of medications (antidepressants), major depression, and preclinical AD on naturalistic driving.
 To test these Specific Aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in AD,
depression, neuroimaging biomarkers, CSF biomarkers, naturalistic driving, cognitive and brain aging, and
longitudinal biostatistical methods. We will capitalize on existing infrastructure to follow 70 currently enrolled
individuals and enroll an additional 70 participants with depression, to create a cohort of 140 individuals. This
cohort will utilize a naturalistic driving methodology that will capture their driving behaviors on an everyday
basis. Their cognition will be tested annually using the Clinical Dementia Rating and various psychometric
measures. Participant depression will be characterized using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview
(MINI) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
 Once obtained, this knowledge can be used to create stage-appropriate, personalized, driving-related
safety strategies that can be implemented upon diagnosis, and adjusted throughout disease progression."
10814399,"Nearly 5 million Americans require augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) methods to meet their
daily communication needs. Some of these high-need individuals have motor impairments so severe (due to
conditions such as brainstem stroke, traumatic brain injury, Guillain Barré syndrome, and cerebral palsy, among
other disabilities) that they do not have the manual dexterity to control AAC technology and require alternative
access methods (such as eye-tracking, head-tracking, or switch-scanning). Existing solutions, however, require
extensive maintenance, frequent re-calibrations, and manual interface modifications that must be carried out
with continued assistance from a caregiver or by compensating via their own residual motor activity. The
excessive workload of adapting to these alternative communication methods are among the leading causes of
AAC abandonment, ultimately depriving this population of their fundamental right to communication. To meet
the critical communication needs of individuals with severe motor impairments, we propose the first AAC
device comprising a versatile access method that automatically learns and customizes a keyboard interface to
the residual motor function of the individual. In Phase I, we established the feasibility of developing a
personalized keyboard interface (limited to A–Z, space) based on an individual’s cursor movement and target
selection abilities using a combined surface electromyographic (sEMG) and inertial (IMU) access method placed
on their forehead. When evaluated amongst individuals with and without severe motor impairments, our AAC
solution achieved greater information transfer rates (ITRs) over the standard QWERTY keyboard. Having
successfully demonstrated this proof-of-concept, we are collaborating with speech researchers and clinicians at
Boston University, MA (STEPP Lab for Sensorimotor Rehabilitation Engineering) and Madonna Rehabilitation
Hospital, NE (Institute for Rehabilitation Science and Engineering) to advance our Phase I system into a pre-
commercial MyAACTM system comprising versatile access method and personalized, comprehensive
communication software. We will achieve this by developing hardware to support streamlined access across
multiple points on the body (Aim 1), designing automated algorithms to rapidly create an expanded AAC
interface, inclusive of letters, numbers, symbols, emojis, and word completion options, that is personalized based
on the residual motor function of user-specific access points (Aim 2), creating software for point-of-care use of
the access technology and interface, and evaluating the resulting MyAACTM system for communication efficacy
in individuals with severe motor impairments (Aim 3). Our milestone will be to demonstrate that MyAACTM
improves ITR and user experience over conventional AAC devices. The final MyAACTM deliverable will be easily
integrated with existing AAC tablets and mobile devices to provide those in need of alternative communication
methods with an automatically customized, efficient, and intuitive solution to restore communication access in
their daily lives."

The Y chromosome is widely believed to be the sole source of sex differences in mammals. Emerging work,
including from our group, however, also implicates X-linked genes in inducing sexually dimorphic gene
expression. Although most X-linked genes are expressed equally between females and males through the
transcriptional inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in females, some escape X-inactivation and are
subject to higher expression in females. Differences in the levels of expression of X-linked genes between the
sexes may thus contribute to sex differences. The long-term goal of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms
of sex-biased transcriptional regulation. In the prior round of funding, we found that the higher expression in
females of the X-inactivation escapee Kdm5c induces X-inactivation selectively in females and not males in an
evolutionarily conserved. We have also accumulated preliminary data suggesting that whereas at a higher
expression dose KDM5C induces X-inactivation, at a lower dose it paradoxically first prevents inactivation of
the active X chromosome in males as well as in females. We further found that KDM5C also regulates
autosomal genes in a sex-biased manner. The overall objective of this proposal, which constitute the next
steps toward attaining our long-term goal, is to determine mechanistically how KDM5C functions in a sex-
biased manner. Our central hypothesis is that KDM5C regulates gene expression in a sex-biased manner on
the X chromosomes as well as autosomes through dose-dependent and locus-specific H3K4me2/3
demethylation. The rationale for this proposal is that the mechanistic dissection of KDM5C function will inform
the hormone-independent regulation of sexually dimorphic gene expression. The proposal's central hypothesis
will be tested by the following two specific aims: 1) Determine how KDM5C orchestrates the selection of the
active and the inactive X chromosome in mouse embryos and stem cells; and, 2) Mechanistically dissect the
functions of KDM5C in hormone-independent regulation of sex-biased gene expression in mouse embryos and
differentiating embryonic stem cells. The Aims will be tested by ablating or tuning the expression of KDM5C
protein and connecting changes in histone H3K4me1/2/3 modifications and their downstream effectors to
changes in the expression of the KDM5C target loci genome-wide. The proposed research is innovative
because it promises a novel mechanism underlying mammalian sex differences, including in the divergent
transcriptional fates of the X chromosomes, using cutting-edge chromatin and single-cell transcriptional
profiling technologies. The significance of the proposal is that it will identify novel dose-dependent genetic and
epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to sex differences independently of hormones."

Peru has the second highest incidence of tuberculosis (TB) disease in the Americas [1]. Despite causing the
largest number of deaths worldwide due to any single agent infectious disease, no study has yet examined the
influence of the pathogen genome on TB pathology as defined by the extent of radiological involvement on the
chest radiograph. Therefore, our first Aim is to combine population level genome sequencing data with
radiological data and linked clinical and demographic metadata to determine using novel multivariate genome
wide association (GWAS) techniques the bacterial genomic biomarkers of TB pathology
More than 80% of TB disease arises following a transmission event that occurs outside the home [2].
Understanding where, when and how frequently transmission events occur in the community is therefore critical
in order to intervene and prevent spread of the disease. Identifying transmission sites, intervening and thereby
preventing transmission is critical to diminishing the spread of primary drug resistance [3]. Therefore, our second
Aim is to use population level whole genome sequencing together with real time GPS monitoring and the latest
in spatial ecology mapping analysis to uncover new sites of TB transmission relative to matched controls
Acquired drug resistance also contributes significantly to the global burden of drug resistance [4]. How TB strain
genotype influences the acquisition of drug resistance remains disputed and insufficiently understood [5–11].
Identifying which genetic background is most associated with the acquisition of drug resistance to specific drugs
would enable patients with drug susceptible TB to receive a personalized treatment regimen that minimizes the
development of drug resistance on that genetic background. Therefore, our third aim is to use a unique set of
>9000 bacterial strains collected in Peru at the population level over 20 years to phylogenetically infer which
genetic background is associated with drug resistance acquisition; then confirm these findings in the laboratory
and on a similar Moldovan dataset collection of >3000 strains.
Preliminary studies have identified a TB bacterial genetic background that is highly associated with drug
resistance [12]. We have also identified new community sites where significant TB transmission occurs [13] as
well as identifying putative bacterial genetic polymorphisms independently associated with pathology in drug
resistant TB. Our proposed study could help to diminish TB transmission in the region, identify new biomarkers
of pathology, uncover new sites of TB transmission, and identify the bacterial genetic associations with drug
resistance acquisition."

The complications of diabetes, particularly impaired wound healing and diabetes-associated nephropathy, are
major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with types 1 and 2 diabetes. The RAGE extracellular domains
are heterogeneous and RAGE ligands may bind at spatially-distinct sites on these domains, thereby indicating
that the use of small molecules or antibodies targeted to the extracellular domains, may be ineffective. We have
discovered that the interaction of the cytoplasmic tail of RAGE (ctRAGE) with the intracellular formin molecule,
DIAPH1, is essential for RAGE-mediated signal transduction. We previously performed a high-throughput screen
of >59,000 compounds with the goal to block the interaction of ctRAGE with DIAPH1. We identified two lead
series (LS) that fulfill key criteria for drug-like properties; from one of the series, LSII, RAGE229 emerged as a
plausible lead for clinical development because of efficacy, favorable pharmacokinetic profile and promising
early-stage off-target and toxicity testing. In vivo efficacy was also demonstrated, as administration of RAGE229
attenuated inflammation in a delayed type hypersensitivity experiment in mice, reduced myocardial infarct size
upon ligation and reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in diabetic mice, and reduced
multiple parameters of diabetes-associated kidney pathology and impaired wound healing in diabetic mice, all
versus vehicle, in both male and female mice. However, in late-stage testing, RAGE229 tested positive in the
Mini-AMES test. To address this liability, we have already prepared new analogs of RAGE229; these analogs
retain potency but are negative in the Mini-AMES test. In addition, we have made significant progress in
developing back-up candidates in the LS I. Importantly, a lead benchmark compound within LSI tested negative
in the Mini-AMES test as well. Our established, multi-disciplinary team is now well-poised to move forward
aggressively at this critical juncture to identify lead candidate molecules for LSII and the back-up LSI for ultimate
clinical development for diabetic complications. Our drug discovery goals, supported by extensive preliminary
data are: 1) to identify potent, selective, and safe candidate analogs of LSII; and 2) to develop LSI backup
candidates with a different scaffold to mitigate risk to our RAGE program. If successful, our work will set the
stage for the development and clinical testing of a novel class of disease-modifying agents for diabetic
complications."

Our long-term goal is to identify neural mechanisms of healthy and impaired balance to guide mechanistically-
based predictors, assessments, and interventions for addressing balance and gait impairments common in aging
and neurological disorders. It is well-known clinically that engagement of cortical resources in balance control
is an indicator of fall risk in older adults including stroke survivors, as inferred by the degradation of balance
and/or gait performance when a concurrent cognitive task shifts attention away from balance control. A scientific
barrier to improving prognostic tools, preventive strategies, and interventions for balance impairments is that we
lack an understanding of how and when cortical resources are engaged in balance control, particularly with
balance task difficulty. An innovation of our proposal is to identify direct, mechanistic measures of cortical
activity during reactive balance. We will combine MPI Ting’s expertise in the neuromechanics of reactive
balance control and MPI Borich’s expertise in human electrophysiology to identify relationships between brain
activity and motor function to improve stroke rehabilitation. Our objective is to identify cortical activity signatures
that distinguish individual-, task-, and group-level differences in the engagement of cortical resources for balance
control amongst young adults (Aim 1), older adults (Aim 2), and older adults with unilateral lesions due to stroke
(Aim 3). We will measure electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic (EMG), and biomechanical signals
during reactive balance recovery to support-surface translations. We propose to use both clinically feasible
electrode-based analysis approaches, as well as mechanistically-important anatomically-informed functional
analyses using high-density EEG in combination with structural and functional MRI scans. We hypothesize that
cortical activity signatures during balance control increase in an individual-, age-, and disease-specific manner
as balance task difficulty increases. Within groups, we predict individual variability in cortical activity to be
explained by balance challenge, i.e., balance task difficulty normalized to step threshold, a measure of balance
function. However, between groups, we predict cortical activity signatures and their relation to balance challenge
will differ. Our Aims are motivated by our preliminary data that show 1) increases in N1 and beta power over
leg sensorimotor regions with balance task difficulty depend on balance function in young and older adults 2)
opposite relationships between sensorimotor functional connectivity and balance task difficulty in younger vs.
older adults; 3) distinct aspects of balance function associated with sensorimotor vs. prefrontal-motor
connectivity in older adults; and 4) sensorimotor functional connectivity in stroke survivors associated with
walking function. If successful, we will identify neurophysiological indicators of balance health that will be broadly
applicable across the lifespan, and across neurological and orthopedic balance disorders to significantly
advance the scientific framework to enable precision-medicine strategies for personalized, mechanistic
assessments and interventions to improve quality of life those with poor balance health."

The consequences of irradiation- and/or Cisplatin (IR/CisP)-induced neuronal toxicity,
i.e., neurological function deficits, often irreversible and permanent, represent a daunting
challenge when treating patients with cancer. The underlying mechanisms of toxicity remain
poorly understood and the ability to selectively protect neuronal survival while not compromising
tumor control following IR/CisP is lacking. This proposal aims to determine the mechanisms
protecting neurons from IR/CisP-induced cytotoxicity, with the overarching goal to provide
evidence supporting novel strategies to decrease their neurotoxicity, while maintaining therapy
efficacy and improving patient quality of life. NAD+-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 2 (SIRT2),
which is highly expressed in differentiated neurons, is involved in diverse cellular processes
including metabolism, response to oxidative stress, and tumor suppression. Our preliminary study
has discovered a novel signaling network that connects SIRT2 to transcription coupled-
homologous recombination repair (TC-HRR) and -nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) of DNA
damage and neuronal cell resistance to IR/CisP-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, our data
revealed that CSB, the key mediator for TC-HR/TC-NER, is directly deacetylated by SIRT2.
Moreover, the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which is involved in DNA damage signaling in
neuron cells, phosphorylates and inhibits SIRT2 function in DNA repair and neuronal survival
following IR/CisP. We hypothesize that SIRT2 activity, which is suppressed by CDK5-mediated
phosphorylation, protects neurons against IR/CisP-induced DNA damage by enhancing CSB-
directed TC-NER and TC-HRR, thereby attenuating neuronal cytotoxicity and neurological
deficits. A series of in vitro and in vivo experiments are proposed to test this hypothesis: Aim 1
will determine whether CSB mediates SIRT2 promotion of TC-NER/TC-HRR and neuron survival
following IR/CisP. Aim 2 will determine how CDK5 negatively regulates SIRT2 function in TC-
NER/TC-HRR and neuron survival following IR/CisP. Aim 3 will test if pharmacologically targeting
SIRT2 specifically attenuates neuronal deficits following IR/CisP-based cancer therapy. Results

10814275,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tobacco use remains the leading cause of death in the United States and contributes to more than 7 million
hospitalizations annually. Hospitalization offers a critical window for intervention: hospital policies prohibit
smoking, patients are highly motivated to quit, and societal guidelines recommend that clinicians should
counsel patients and prescribe smoking cessation pharmacotherapy (SCP) to virtually all smokers.
Nevertheless, only 22% of patients are ever prescribed SCP while hospitalized and only 1% of patients are
prescribed guideline-concordant SCP. This failure ultimately contributes to a 70-80% smoking relapse rate,
most of which occurs within a few days of hospital discharge – well before outpatient follow-up can occur.
 If we are to capitalize on the opportunity that hospitalization provides to maximize smoking cessation
treatment and outcomes, new strategies are needed to overcome the low uptake of guideline-concordant SCP
by physicians and patients. To address this problem, we propose to deploy a nurse practitioner-led, hospital-
based tobacco treatment team to: 1) prescribe individually tailored and guideline-concordant SCP; 2) counsel
and motivate patients to use SCP properly; and 3) and manage a mobile phone-based text-messaging system
to keep patients motivated and adherent to SCP. Our preliminary data suggest that such an approach is
feasible and acceptable to patients, physicians, and hospital administrators.
 In Aim 1, we will perform a parallel-group implementation-effectiveness randomized trial among 424
hospitalized smokers with a cardiopulmonary disease in a large tertiary hospital. We will compare rates of SCP
use and smoking cessation between patients who received the intervention and those who did not. In Aim 2,
we will measure the economic value of the intervention from both a hospital and payer perspective to better
inform hospital and insurance policies and sustainability. In Aim 3, we will perform qualitative interviews with
patients, physicians, staff members, and hospital administrators to evaluate the acceptability and sustainability
of our strategies. We hypothesize that our intervention will: improve guideline-concordant SCP use; increase 6-
month smoking cessation rates; be acceptable to patients, clinicians, and administrators; and be cost-effective
and sustainable.
 Our multi-disciplinary team has broad experience in cardiopulmonary medicine, tobacco treatment,
implementation science, medication adherence, qualitative methods, health economics, and text message
technology. At the conclusion of this grant, our team will develop a detailed, evidence-informed implementation
guide for a hospital-based tobacco treatment team. Ultimately, we anticipate the knowledge gained from this
study will facilitate widespread and effective hospital-based tobacco treatment so that more patients lead lives
free from tobacco and cardiopulmonary disease."
10814339,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Viruses are infectious agents that replicate inside the living cells of an organism, and it remains critical to
understand the basic molecular mechanisms that govern viral replication, as they perform numerous complex
physical and chemical processes ranging from atomic-scale phenomena, such as the quantum chemistry of
bond cleavage to large-scale processes, such as protein self-assembly. These processes are fundamentally
multiscale since they span time and length scales from the molecular to the mesoscopic. For instance, during
viral particle maturation, proteolytic cleavage of the group-specific antigen polyprotein (Gag) releases capsid
domain proteins (CA) that subsequently reassemble into a fullerene capsid. Our overarching goal is to study
the molecular processes involved in viral replication using theory, physics-based modeling, and computer
simulations.
This proposal focuses on five key aspects of the viral life cycle: (1) how innate immune sensors like the
tripartite motif containing protein 5 α (TRIM5α) restrict viral infection by assembling into hexagonally-patterned
lattices to physically cage the viral core and signal the capsid for degradation, (2) the material and physical
properties of the capsid shell that encases and protects the viral genome, (3) the chemical features of pH-
gated pores distributed throughout the capsid surface, (4) the large-scale morphological changes that occur
during virion maturation, and (5) the conformational dynamics of spike proteins in SARS-CoV-2 virion fusion.
Our strategy is to develop multiscale simulation methods to link molecular behavior at one length-scale to the
next. Coarse-grained (CG) methods and reduced representation models will be developed that retain the
essential physics of the biological process and are also computationally efficient to simulate large-scale viral
processes. All-atom (AA) simulations will be used to accurately probe protein conformational dynamics. Bond
cleavage and formation will be described using mixed quantum-classical approaches, e.g., quantum
mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. These simulations will serve as the basis for
developing reactive CG models based on hybrid kinetic Monte Carlo molecular dynamics (MC/MD) to link
quantum phenomena to the CG scale.
Computational predictions on viral replication will be tested and validated in collaboration with leading
structural biologists and biochemists. Collectively, insights from these studies will broadly impact the fields of
molecular simulation, virology, and computational biophysics. Findings from these studies have the potential to
aid in the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat viral infection."

10820461,"Radiation, inflammation, infection, and toxins can damage the integrity of the gastrointestinal epithelium. Mechanisms that initiate, facilitate, and subsequently attenuate regeneration are essential to prevent long-term damage or disease. Post-transcriptional regulons are groups of functionally-related mRNAs regulated primarily by RNA-binding proteins, which enable rapid, tissue-specific responses to cellular damage. This type of regulation is especially important in highly proliferative tissues such as the intestinal epithelium, where RNA-binding proteins may serve as “rheostats” for cellular and tissue adaptation. Our overarching goal is to identify novel strategies to enhance intestinal epithelial regeneration and improve therapies for patients, especially those who experience injury to the gastrointestinal epithelium as a result of radiation or chemotherapy. We discovered recently that epithelial regeneration is enhanced in mice with intestinal epithelial deletion of IMP1 (IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 1; also called IGF2BP1), in part via up-regulation of the autophagy pathway. Autophagy is a mechanism by which cells adapt and survive in response to stress. For example, recent studies in mouse models with autophagy gene deletion demonstrate increased susceptibility to irradiation-induced tissue damage. Defining the link between IMP1 and autophagy would contribute to an emerging paradigm of post-transcriptional regulons that serve as critical regulators of gastrointestinal epithelial regeneration. Aim 1 will examine the molecular mechanisms by which IMP1 regulates autophagy gene translation. We will use cell biology assays as well as ribosome-profiling in epithelial cells from mice with Imp1 deletion to define direct roles for IMP1 in autophagy (and other) gene translation. Aim 2 will evaluate how IMP1-mediated changes in autophagy contribute to stem cell dynamics at homeostasis using mouse models, autophagy assays, and enteroid-formation assays. Aim 3 will evaluate intestinal stem cell-specific roles of IMP1 in autophagy-mediated repair during irradiation-induced injury and subsequent regeneration. We will use mouse models of Imp1 deletion together with chemical or genetic deletion of autophagy to define how IMP1 normally functions during irradiation-induced injury and regeneration and whether this is autophagy-dependent. Successful completion of this proposal has the potential for both scientific and clinical impact and will provide a basis for improved or novel therapies for patients with radiation-induced (and potentially other) injury to the intestinal epithelium."

10816155,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nonhormonal agents that block the development of highly fluid midcycle cervical mucus would have a
contraceptive effect without affecting other aspects of the menstrual cycle. Endocervical cells produce a
mucus secretion that varies in viscosity during the menstrual cycle. Under the influence of rising levels of
estradiol in natural cycles, mucus changes in consistency from highly viscous and impenetrable to sperm to a
highly fluid state that allows sperm to enter and move into the upper genital tract. As progesterone rises with
ovulation, mucus consistency rapidly reverts to the viscous impenetrable state. Thick, impenetrable mucus is
the mechanism of action of the levonorgestrel IUD, a progestin-only method of contraception that does not
block ovulation. “Cervical factor infertility” is the diagnosis for women that have poor mucus quality during
otherwise normal ovulatory cycles, and become pregnant with intrauterine insemination that bypasses the
cervix. Women with certain mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
gene develop cervical factor infertility as a manifestation of their cystic fibrosis. CFTR codes for a membrane
protein that functions as a chloride/bicarbonate channel, and controls ion and water secretion and absorption
in epithelial tissues. Preliminary studies in our lab have documented that CFTR is expressed in endocervical
cells, hormonally-regulated, and plays a critical role in the regulation of cervical mucus consistency.
Considerable research over the last few decades has led to the discovery of a number of small molecules that
act as activators and inhibitors of CFTR. We have identified that the CFTR inhibitor Inh-172 blocks
endocervical cell CFTR activity in vitro and in vivo, resulting in an increase in mucus viscosity. In this project,
we propose to evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) effects of vaginal
administration of Inh-172 in the baboon model. In the R61 phase, we will conduct validation of efficacy studies
including mucus physical properties, mucus sperm interactions and in vivo sperm inhibition. During the R33
phase, in collaboration with field-leading vaginal ring drug delivery teams from the Queens University of
Belfast, we will formulate Inh-172 into vaginal rings and measure levels of Inh-172 in local vaginal and
cervical tissues, compare these to circulating plasma concentrations, and correlate these drug levels with
efficacy outcomes. Additionally, we will evaluate safety endpoints including systemic effects of CFTR inhibition
as well as local, vaginal health. Results of these experiments will provide proof-of-concept data to support
advancement of one or more delivery systems into early phase clinical trials in women."
10817728,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Traumatic injury is a leading cause of death and disability for older adults in the United States. Due to the physiological
and psychosocial processes of aging, older adults have unique trauma care needs. Unfortunately, current guidelines for
trauma care and emergency medical services (EMS) to not adequately address these needs. The impact of prehospital
care on health outcomes represents a substantial gap in the literature for the treatment of injured older adults.
Approximately 10% of injured older adults receive opioid analgesia for pain management during the prehospital interval,
or the time from the onset of injury until hospital arrival. Little is known about the consequences of these interventions.
Prehospital opioid analgesia could decrease risk of delirium by managing severity of acute pain, and thereby reducing
the accumulation of factors disrupting normal brain activity and improving health outcomes. Conversely, opioid pain
medications are neuroactive drugs that can disrupt brain activity, increasing risk of delirium and worsening health
outcomes. By either pathway, prehospital administration of opioid analgesia has profound implications for short- and
long-term health and functional status of injured older adults. This application for a National Institute on Aging
Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) seeks support for Dr. Molly Jarman, a new Instructor of Surgery
at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Center for Surgery and Public Health who aspires to a career focused on
improving the quality, effectiveness, and accessibility of prehospital EMS and trauma care systems for the older adult
population in the United States. Dr. Jarman’s prior research has focused on geographic determinants of injury mortality
and access to trauma center care. To extend the impact and practical application of this research, Dr. Jarman proposes
to move her research toward geriatric trauma outcomes, addressing the emerging need for trauma care optimized for
the aging United States population. Accordingly, the K01 training is focused on gaining knowledge in geriatric trauma
care and prehospital trauma care services, as well as statistical methods for causal inference and economic analysis. The
proposed research will employ advanced analytic methods to closely examine the impact of prehospital pain
management interventions. Research aims will include (1) an assessment of factors influencing EMS use of prehospital
opioid analgesia for injured older adults, (2) short- and long-term health outcomes associated with prehospital opioid
analgesia, and (3) estimation of Medicare expenditures during the first year following injury for patients with and
without prehospital pain management. The practical application of this work will be to inform efforts by national, state,
and local EMS leaders seeking to provide appropriate care for injured older adults during the prehospital interval,
including changes to practice guidelines and investment in EMS infrastructure and/or personnel training. By providing
salary support, training, freedom from administrative responsibilities, and formal mentorship structure, this award will
facilitate Dr. Jarman’s transition to an independent research career focused on improve health outcomes and functional
status of injured older adults."

The diagnosis and treatment of oral and oropharyngeal cancers adversely affects the ability to swallow, taste,
speak, chew, and maintain movement of the head, neck, and shoulder. To preserve function and reduce late
effects, survivors coordinate their long-term medical and psychosocial needs, manage a significant number of
daily care routines, and address comorbidities. Despite the significant long-term survivorship care
requirements, there are no empirically-based interventions to assist survivors in building skills and confidence
to effectively manage their care. We have evaluated the information and support needs of survivors recruited
via the New Jersey State Cancer Registry and, using this feedback, designed, and tested the feasibility and
preliminary efficacy of Empowered Survivor (ES), an innovative and interactive online intervention. Our results
indicated that Empowered Survivor was well-utilized and resulted in significant improvements in self-efficacy in
managing care, greater preparedness for managing survivorship, and head and neck specific quality of life
(QOL). Engagement in three self-care behaviors (oral self-exam, swallowing and head and neck mobility
exercises) increased. The goal of the proposed study is to bolster the ES intervention by enhancing modules
and adding two modules based on participant input: Calm and Connect, which focuses on managing
psychological concerns, and Maintaining, which focuses on maintaining self-care routines. We will evaluate ES
against a free online self-management intervention, Springboard Beyond Cancer (Springboard), which was
developed for cancer survivors by the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society. Six hundred
patients who have completed treatment between one and three years ago and are currently cancer-free will be
recruited via the New Jersey State Cancer Registry or the Cancer Registry of Greater California and randomly
assigned to ES or Springboard. Participants will complete measures at baseline, 2, and 6-months post-
baseline. Finally, we will engage in a process evaluation of Empowered Survivor to inform future
implementation. This single site clinical trial study has four aims. Aim 1 evaluates the impact of ES versus
Springboard on the primary outcomes of self-efficacy, preparedness, and head and neck specific QOL. Aim 2
examines mediators (planning, information needs, support needs, activation, fear of recurrence) and
moderators (age, race/ethnicity, sex, HPV status, baseline self-efficacy and preparedness) of ES's impact on
self-efficacy in managing care, preparedness, and head and neck specific QOL. Aim 3 evaluate the impact of
ES versus Springboard Beyond Cancer on the secondary outcomes of engagement in oral self-exams and
head and neck mobility exercises. The Exploratory Aim conducts a process evaluation of ES to inform future
implementation. Although cancer survivors have many long-term self-care needs, there are few empirically-
based self-management interventions for cancer survivors. Should Empowered Survivor prove efficacious, it
will serve as a model of care and advance both science and practice for survivors of all types of cancer,
particularly survivors who receive their care in the community."
10817760,"The hippocampus neurogenic niche (HNN) generates new neurons in mammals, but it is unclear if this is
happening in humans. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is necessary to maintain intact cognitive and emotional
functions regulated by the hippocampus. Markers of immaturity have been detected in neuronal cells of the HNN
but it is still unclear if they represent adult-born neurons, or neuronal cells that have maintained their immaturity
since birth. We found that the number of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature neurons was stable
throughout the eighth decade of life in normal aging (NA) subjects, but angiogenesis and neuroplasticity were
decreased in older people. Other groups have supported our findings, while some could not detect immature
neuronal cells in human hippocampus. Moreover, in aging mice, more NPCs differentiate into glia rather than
neurons, compared to younger animals, but we do not know if this happens in humans. Adult neurogenesis is
lower in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and it is unknown if this is because more NPCs differentiate into glia or through
other mechanisms. These gaps in knowledge warrant the use of new technologies to investigate cellular lineages
in the human HNN, and molecular regulators of NPCs proliferation, cell fate, differentiation, maturation and
survival. This project aims to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and genes (DEGs) in the human
HNN, at the regional and single cell level, comparing NA and AD. We will apply our pipeline using high resolution
mass spectrometry for proteomics analysis, and single nuclei (sn) RNA and ATAC (Assay for Transposase-
Accessible Chromatin) sequencing (seq), to identify gene expression and epigenetic changes. In slide-mounted
hippocampus tissue, we will apply Visium (10X Genomics) and our custom-made spatial transcriptomic
technology for anatomical co-mapping of cell-type specific mRNAs and proteins (DBiT-seq). Novel computational
approaches will identify neurogenesis regulators in the human HNN that can be tested in cellular or animal
models. Findings obtained with these “OMICS” approaches will be validated using HighPlex RNAscope®
(ADCBio) and immunofluorescence, and qPCR, Western blots, and ELISA assays, to visualize and quantify DEP
and DEG expression at the single cell and regional level. Our rigorous brain collection methods assure tissue
quality, uniform processing, use of toxicology and neuropathology, and strict clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Groups include: NA subjects (N=100), Braak stage 0-1, age 14-99 yrs., 40 of which (60 years of age and older)
are matched (by age, sex and postmortem interval between death and brain collection) with 40 AD cases (from
the Columbia Taub Institute collection), Braak stage 1 through 4. Aims: 1. Identify HNN DEPs associated with
NA and AD. 2. Identify DEGs in immature and mature neuronal and glial cell populations of the DG in NA and
AD subjects, using sn-RNA and sn-ATAC-seq (10X Genomics). 3. Determine the anatomical localization of cell
expressing DEGs and DEPs associated with NA and AD, using Visium and DBiT-seq. 4. Test correlations
between DEPs and DEGs, and numbers of NPCs and immature neurons and glia in NA and AD."

The U-RISE Program at Clark Atlanta University (CAU) is designed to transition academically promising
undergraduates spread across the breadth of STEM disciplines into doctoral programs in biomedical sciences.
We recognize that millennial scientists will be expected to keep pace with increasing demands to use quantitative

Therefore, through a thoughtfully designed training program with a committed group of academic leaders and
faculty mentors, we propose to engage a cohort of promising scholars in a truly interdisciplinary curriculum that
builds on a foundation provided by CAU (through the U-RISE Prep Program). Our overall objective for the U-
RISE Program at CAU is to have a significant and measurable impact on student retention and completion rates
within our STEM majors so that these specially trained scholars then progress logically into doctoral studies.
Given that CAU holds three major distinctions: 1) the largest United Negro College Fund (UNCF) institution; 2)
a Carnegie R2 research classification—a doctoral university with high research activity; and 3) the fourth largest
generator of African American PhDs, we are well-positioned to substantively contribute to our nation’s agenda
of growing its research and innovation capacity through the preparation of competitive scientists who continue
to be traditionally underrepresented in the biomedical field. Our planned objectives span fostering a talented pool
of undergraduate students who are capable of thriving in high-caliber, research-intensive institutions both as
students and members of the academy while undertaking a training plan that includes curricular enhancements,
specialized programming, and research immersion that begins early and orchestrated with direct support and
consultation from carefully matched faculty mentors. By investing in an inclusive, training environment for a
cohort of promising young scientists, we intend to create a program that is designed to offer a framework, that is
constructed with a technical-operational-professional strategy, grounded in the values of responsible conduct for
the pursuit of research, and enriched with a tailored and meaningful curriculum and professional development
modules to become competitive in the pursuit of graduate studies. With plans for ongoing evaluations and
dissemination, we intend to share our knowledge and outcomes with others who have been challenged with
retention and program advancement, particularly at other historically black colleges and universities where many
of America’s next generation of great biomedical researchers can be discovered."
10817920,"ABSTRACT
More than half of Crohn’s disease (CD) patients develop stricture induced intestinal obstruction and ultimately
requiring surgery. A mechanistic understanding of intestinal stricture formation is mandatory to develop novel
preventive and therapeutic approaches. Hyperplasia of the muscularis propria (MP) rather than extracellular
matrix (ECM) deposition is a major contributor to intestinal wall thickening and hence gut luminal narrowing. In
intestinal segments affected by CD, wrapping of mesenteric fat around the bowel is typically observed, called
‘creeping fat’. This is specific for CD and highly associated with the presence of MP hyperplasia and stricturing
disease (with or without internal penetrating disease). There are essentially no mechanistic data linking creeping
fat with intestinal stricture formation or explaining creeping fat formation. Preliminary results show that
mesenteric fat derived lipids selectively induce remarkable proliferation of human intestinal MP muscle cells
(HIMC) via long-chain free fatty acids (LC-FFAs) metabolism and uptake into mitochondria through the
transporter carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT-1A). ECM released by activated HIMC, predominantly
fibronectin (FN), selectively promotes migration of primary human mesenteric adipocytes (Ad) and Pre-Ad. This
resembles formation of creeping fat around intestinal segments. Hence, we propose the following hypothesis:
stricture formation in CD is the result of a feedback loop where creeping fat non-immune cell-derived
factors induce smooth muscle cell hyperplasia leading to increased secretion of ECM which promotes
further creeping fat formation. This hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Define
the mechanisms of creeping fat-induced smooth muscle cell hyperplasia. We will identify creeping fat derived
mediators and their cellular source responsible for HIMC proliferation, focusing on FFA signaling pathways,
proliferation, mitochondrial function and modulation of the proliferation pathways. Specific Aim 2. Determine the
role of HIMC-derived ECM molecules in integrin-mediated adipocyte migration. We will investigate mechanisms
of HIMC-derived ECM leading to fat migration using a loss-of-function and gain-of-function approach with the
goal to identify specific integrin signaling pathways. Specific Aim 3. Investigate the effect of mesenteric fat
deletion and mitochondrial muscle metabolism on intestinal smooth muscle hyperplasia in vivo. We will induce
experimental fibrosis in two transgenic mouse strains that 1) exhibit fat deletion that can be temporally controlled
and 2) delete the mitochondrial transporter CPT-1 prior to and after induction of experimental intestinal fibrosis
specifically in -SMA positive muscle cells. In addition, we present the first mouse model for creeping fat,
developing after repeated intestinal injury. We will assess creeping fat formation and resolution by temporally
controlled deletion of FN selectively in -SMA positive muscle cells. If successful, this proposal will challenge
the paradigm of purely immune-driven ECM deposition driving stricture formation and provide novel
mechanisms to prevent or treat stricture associated intestinal obstruction in CD patients."
10817922,"The long-term goal of this research is a prosthetic socket for trans-tibial prosthesis users that continually adjusts
size so as to both maintain a proper fit and stabilize limb volume. The socket relieves users of the burden of
continually sensing if their socket fit has deteriorated, deciding what adjustment to make, and effecting a socket
size change. Users may instead focus on other aspects of their life. The auto-adjusting socket should enhance
independence, improve limb health, and enrich patient quality of life.
The specific aims are to modify an auto-adjusting socket for Walking previously developed by our group to add
a remote key fob interface and two new auto-adjustment algorithms. The compact key fob eliminates a barrier
present in the prior design. A Low Activity auto-adjustment algorithm manages socket size to maintain fit during
short bouts of walking mixed with standing, as would occur for example when moving about in a building. A
Sitting algorithm facilitates limb fluid volume recovery during sitting. The algorithms are optimized through lab-
based participant testing. Performance of the complete auto-adjusting socket system is tested in user free-living
environments in three modes: auto-adjusting; manual-adjusting; and locked (sock changes only).
The aims are accomplished by alternating between clinical studies and engineering design. In the first aim,
prototype key fobs are fabricated and evaluated by participants with limb amputation and prosthetists in a
qualitative study design. From the results a single design is specified for development. In the second aim, new
auto-adjustment algorithms are created and added to the existing on-board control system to maintain fit during
combined short bouts of walking and standing (Low Activity) and during sitting (Sitting). Fit is monitored using
measurements from custom limb-socket distance sensors embedded in the socket. In a crossover randomized
trial, socket comfort, residual limb health, variability in limb fluid volume, and control system error are assessed
while participants wear the socket during a structured protocol with all three auto-adjustment functions enabled
(Walking, Low Activity, Sitting) compared with only the Walking function enabled. Based on study results, the
socket control system is updated accordingly. In the third aim, a crossover randomized trial is conducted in at-
home testing where participants wear the socket in auto, manual, and locked modes. In the manual mode,
participants adjust the socket using the key fob. Participant self-report scores, residual limb health, prosthesis
use, activities, socket fit, number of manual socket adjustments and participant preference are compared.
The health relatedness of this application is a reduction of the burden of socket fit monitoring and fit management
for patients with limb loss. Rather than having to continually manage their disability, people with limb amputation
may live more independent lives. The auto-adjusting socket should also reduce residual limb health
complications from poor socket fit. The system may serve as a model for design of technologies that address
other levels of amputation (e.g., transfemoral, upper-limb) where automatic adjustment to maintain fit is needed."
10817797,"ABSTRACT
 The long-term goal of our lab is to understand the role of the Core Binding Factor (CBF) family of
transcription factors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CBF family members, which include RUNX1 and its
binding partner CBFB, are the most frequently mutated genes in leukemia. One of the most common recurrent
CBF mutations is the fusion gene CBFB-MYH11 (CM), which is generated by of the inversion of chromosome
16 [inv(16)]. Expression of CM is the initiating event in AML development, but additional cooperating mutations,
such as activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase KIT, are required for transformation to a frank leukemia. CM
is assumed to also be required after the acquisition of cooperating mutations, but its role during leukemia
maintenance is currently poorly understood. CM was originally thought to dominantly repress RUNX1, leading
to the repression of tumor suppressor genes. Our recent work supports a new model of the fusion protein’s
activity: CM and RUNX1 together activate transcription of pro-leukemic genes. This new model implies that
identifying the functionally important targets genes of the fusion protein complex may lead to new potential drug
targets. Another extension of this new model is that there may be additional co-factors required for CM’s
transcriptional activity. In recent work, we found that Histone Deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is part of the CM/RUNX1
complex, and is required for expression of CM target genes. Using a mouse model of inv(16) AML, we found
that the HDAC1 inhibitor entinostat induced differentiation, and reduced leukemic burden in vivo.
 Based on our previous work, we hypothesize that CM is required for the expression of genes that promote
leukemia maintenance, and that HDAC1 is an important co-factor of CM. Consequently, we propose that HDAC1
inhibitors will be particularly useful for the treatment of inv(16) AML. In Specific Aim 1, we will use two
complimentary approaches to define the role of CM in leukemia maintenance: a new knockin mouse model that
allows for deletion of the fusion gene after leukemia development, and an inducible shRNA knockdown model.
We will use these tools to determine CM’s role during leukemia maintenance in vivo, if CM independent cells
can give rise to relapse, and test the role of candidate CM target genes in leukemia maintenance. In Specific
Aim 2, we will determine the requirement for HDAC1 in CM+ leukemia cells, test whether HDAC1 affects
expression of both CM target and non-target genes, and test potential mechanisms for HDAC1’s non-canonical
role in transcriptional activation. Specific Aim 3 will test the potential of the entinostat to treat inv(16) AML. We
will use genetic and patient derived xenograft mouse models to test whether the addition of entinostat to the
standard treatments will reduce leukemic burden and increase survival. We will also test whether using entinostat
to inhibit CM in combination with dasatinib to inhibit cooperating mutations in KIT is more effective than either
drug alone. The proposed studies are based on our accumulated experience and our strong preliminary findings,
and will address important gaps in the field and have direct translational implications for inv(16) AML patients."

Nowhere is the need for disease modifying therapeutic compounds more urgently needed than in the treatment
of mental health disorders. Despite significant advances in pharmaceutical and behavior interventions, mental
illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression and anxiety, combined with substance abuse disorders remain a
significant and growing burden to society. Orphan G-protein coupled receptors (oGPCRs) represent an
untapped reservoir of potential new drug targets for these diseases but the lack of pharmacological tools
needed to validate these targets prevents their therapeutic exploitation. As a first step towards tapping this
reservoir to develop new classes of medicines, we propose to find compounds that bind the oGPCRs and can
be used to validate them as drug targets. Leveraging recent high-resolution gene expression maps of
important brain circuits, we identified 27 oGPCRs whose discrete patterns of expression in the human brain
make them high value neuroscience drug targets. These were further prioritized based on the body of
biological data available for each receptor (e.g. genetics, linkage to disease) with the goal of focusing on
oGPCRs of greatest relevance to mental health. For the top 10 priority targets we will conduct high-throughput
screens against a library of ~50,000 compounds using an innovative ligand-induced forward trafficking assay
we recently published. In this assay, each oGPCR is engineered to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in
a state in which forward transport is enabled by the binding of a ligand. Trafficking of the oGPCR is then
monitored using a split beta-galactosidase reporter system. In this way, compounds (hits) that bind and induce
a conformational change in the oGPCR will be identified. Using a panel of cross and counter screen assays,
hits will be confirmed and shown to engage native oGPCR. Medicinal chemistry will be used to improve
potency and selectivity, and to generate chemical probes with physicochemical attributes suitable for use in
cellular assays exploring the function and pharmacology of target oGPCRs. Selectivity of probes will be
evaluated using a diverse panel of targets including GPCRs, ion channels, nuclear receptors and enzymes.
Where a specific oGPCR is highly expressed in human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, we will investigate the
ability of probes to the specific receptor to affect neural networks using a microelectrode array assay system
we developed. We anticipate that these efforts will generate >10 novel probes against high priority oGPCRs.
Our intention is to rapidly distribute these to the scientific community to accelerate the understanding of these
brain enriched oGPCRs, contributing to their validation as drug targets for psychological disorders."

At a global level, ongoing ecological, environmental and demographic changes favor the survival and expansion
of several mosquito and tick species that transmit arboviruses. Aedes mosquito species that thrive in urban
environments created by humans are responsible for epidemics of several flaviviruses [dengue virus (DENV)
serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4; Zika virus (ZIKV); yellow fever virus (YFV)] and alphaviruses [chikungunya virus (CHIKV)
and Mayaro virus (MAYV)]. Laboratory-based diagnosis and surveillance for arboviruses is difficult because
most infected individuals are asymptomatic or develop a mild undifferentiated febrile illness. Serological assays
have been developed for the detection of recent or past arboviral infections, but the utility of these assays is
severely limited by antibody cross reactivity between related viruses. For example, when ZIKV emerged in many
regions of the Americas where greater than 80% of the population was dengue-immune, with current serological
assays, it was difficult, if not impossible, to identify infected individuals or monitor the spread of ZIKV at a
population level, and likewise to now detect new DENV infections in areas that experienced intense ZIKV
epidemics. Our studies over the past 10 years demonstrate that people exposed to flavivirus infections reliably
develop antibodies to epitopes that are unique to each flavivirus as well as cross-reactive antibodies. Using our
discoveries about the location of immunodominant virus type-specific epitopes, we have produced novel
recombinant antigens and demonstrated their utility for the type-specific diagnosis of arboviruses. Under
Specific Aim 1 of this proposal, we will build on these discoveries to develop a sample-sparing,
microsphere bead-based multiplex assay for the type-specific and sensitive detection of recent or past
arbovirus infections. Our initial studies will focus on 8 arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes
albopictus mosquitos because these viruses share a similar ecology and co-circulate in the same human
populations. At a second stage, we will expand the coverage of the assay to detect infections with other
arboviruses transmitted by other mosquito species and ticks. Several tetravalent DENV and ZIKV vaccines are
currently being evaluated in human clinical trials. While vaccine developers have relied on neutralizing
antibodies as a correlate of protection, recent results from clinical trials demonstrate that neutralizing antibodies
alone are a poor correlate of vaccine safety and efficacy. We have identified flavivirus type- and epitope-specific
antibody responses that are better predictors than neutralizing antibodies of vaccine safety and efficacy. Under
Specific aim 2 of this proposal, we will develop a sample-sparing microsphere-based assay for the
detection of epitope-specific vaccine-induced antibody responses that are correlated with protective
immunity to each of the DENV serotypes and ZIKV. The technological advances and products from this
proposal will enhance our ability to efficiently monitor arbovirus infections at the individual and population levels
and also support the development of arbovirus vaccines."

The Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells (IBSC) at UCSC proposes a postdoctoral training program for 5 fellows
each year (4 NICHD, 1 UCSC sponsored) that prepares postdoctoral fellows to take on leadership roles in pro-
fessions that translate stem cell research into life-long health benefits. The trainees are sponsored for 2-year
training periods that encompass rigorous research focused on normal and abnormal human development in a
stem-cell context and individually tailored career development plans to prepare trainees for academic or biomed-
ical industry jobs. The program was developed in response to research showing that structured mentoring and
targeted career skill building improve career outcomes and increase the motivation of trainees to remain in sci-
ence-focused careers, especially women and minority postdocs.
 The core of the interdisciplinary training program consists of mentored research in laboratories of 24 faculty
members (seasoned and new mentors) belonging to six departments: Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biol-
ogy; Biomolecular Engineering; Chemistry; Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology; Applied Mathematics;
Electrical and Computer Engineering. All mentors accepted into this training program have well-funded stem cell
research programs in NICHD focus areas and have strong scientific records. All mentors will receive regular
mentoring training and new faculty will be paired with seasoned mentors. Trainees will also select co-mentors to
support reaching their career goals.
 Trainees enter the program as a cohort and perform research in a mentor laboratory. In year 1, postdocs
will also take part in formal training including grant writing, responsible conduct of research, and methods for
enhancing reproducibility. In year 2, the program offers a number of additional training and practical opportunities
that enhance leadership, mentoring, entrepreneurial, and communication skills. Participation is customized to
each trainee’s career goals and will be guided by research mentors and co-mentors.
 The program is administered by an Internal Executive Committee and overseen by an External Advisory
board. An External Selection Committee reviews and ranks program applicants for appointment to the program.
An Entrepreneurship Committee will advise on program aspects designed for fellows with interest in industry
careers. Program administration monitors training progress and program success through quarterly feedback,
through annual program reviews by mentors and postdocs, and by documenting the career development of
former trainees.
 This program is designed to improve the job satisfaction, productivity, retention, and career outcomes of
postdoctoral fellows. The proposed training structure is supported enthusiastically by UCSC, as reflected in the
substantial institutional support for this program."

Approximately 10,000 patients receive an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
annually in the United States. Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) is a
rare but often fatal hematologic complication that manifests with uncontrolled microangiopathic
hemolytic anemia (MAHA), thrombocytopenia, microvascular thrombosis, and in severe cases,
permanent neurologic or kidney dysfunction. We recently completed a large retrospective cohort
study to elucidate the incidence of and clinical risk factors for TA-TMA. Building upon the
previous experience, our objectives in the current proposal are to test these clinical predictors
and laboratory biomarkers associated with TA-TMA development in an independent prospective
pediatric cohort to improve early detection and risk stratification. We propose the following aims:
Aim 1: To determine the incidence and early post-transplant risk factors for TA-TMA in a
prospective pediatric cohort study that incorporates the use of clinical informatics. Aim 2: To test
a dynamic risk prediction tool for TA-TMA that incorporates validated clinical and laboratory
biomarkers in immune, endothelial, and complement activation pathways.
The K23 award applicant, Dr. Ang Li, is well-qualified to conduct the proposed project. He is
committed to becoming an independently funded patient-oriented physician scientist in benign
hematology. He has proposed a comprehensive five-year career development plan to help his
transition from supervised research to independence. Specifically, he envisions a strong
mentorship panel, a formal advisory committee, a realistic coursework training in epidemiology,
biostatistics, clinical informatics, and bioethics. The Section of Hematology (primary affiliation)
and Section of Epidemiology and Population Sciences (secondary affiliation) at Baylor College
of Medicine offer an ideal research training environment and the Institution is fully committed to
his career development."
10817817,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol use and smoking during pregnancy often occur in the context of maternal anxiety and depression.
However, little is known regarding how different combinations of maternal alcohol use, smoking, and
psychiatric symptoms interact to alter early central and autonomic nervous system (CNS, ANS) development
and subsequent neurobehavioral outcomes in offspring. To better understand these relationships, this grant
proposes to comprehensively characterize maternal alcohol, smoking, depression, and anxiety patterns during
pregnancy via machine learning and artificial intelligence methodologies; to perform deep phenotyping of
electrocortical and physiological data from infants; to test the overall hypothesis that physiology-derived
measures mediate the relationship between maternal prenatal exposures and subsequent child
neurodevelopmental outcomes. To accomplish these goals, this research proposes to use existing data from
the completed Safe Passage Study conducted by the NIH funded Prenatal Alcohol in SIDS and Stillbirth
(PASS) Network and from recently completed follow-up studies which enrolled subsets of the PASS
participants. PASS cohort participants are from geographically and socio-economically diverse regions in
South Africa and the Northern Plains of the United States. The extant PASS database comprises a detailed
documentation of daily alcohol and smoking exposure and prenatal depression/anxiety assessments collected
for 10,325 maternal/infant dyads and more than 1,000 variables which provide extensive information on
maternal-fetal-infant medical history, demographics, and socio-economic status. These exposure data will be
analyzed in relation to neonatal CNS/ANS deep phenotyping profiles derived from the analysis of 3,355 infant
electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) data recorded either at birth or at one month of
age. The extant neurobehavioral outcomes data were collected in four distinct cohorts of participants originally
enrolled in PASS and followed up at 12 months (n=849) and 24-37 months of age (n=667). The follow-up study
datasets contain item-level data, sub-test raw scores, and scaled-scores for the Mullen scales of early learning,
the Parent Report of Children’s Abilities-Revised (PARCA-R), the Bayley scales of infant development III
screening test and the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers Revised with Follow up (M-CHAT-R/F). The
proposed approach is expected to elucidate mechanisms of suboptimal neurodevelopment and resilience, and
ultimately inform screenings for at-risk groups. Additionally, the proposed comprehensive deep phenotyping is
intended to identify markers that are potential mediators of the relationship between prenatal exposures and
outcomes. We anticipate that our findings will capitalize on the geocultural diversity of our cohorts and provide
meaningful information associated with health disparities in underrepresented populations."
10817821,"Project Summary
Social deficits are common in psychiatric disorders and available treatments are limited. Our lack of basic
knowledge on how the brain controls social behaviors makes it challenging to develop therapeutics for social
deficits. For numerous animal species, social rank dictates many aspects of behavior, such as access to
resources and resilience to stress. Individuals with higher social rank typically win more often during social
conflicts (e.g. food competition) and show more agonistic behaviors; collectivity referred to as dominance
behaviors. Cross-species evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role in
social dominance. However, exactly how the mPFC encodes social rank and which mPFC inputs and outputs
contribute to dominance behaviors is unknown. Multiple studies show that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is
necessary for social memory, and more recently, a study showed that this role involves vHPC input to the mPFC.
Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that the projection from the mPFC to the lateral hypothalamus (LH)
modulates social dominance behavior. These findings in combination with the literature suggest a model in which
the mPFC receives social memory information from the vHPC and guides social behaviors via modulation of LH
GABAergic and glutamatergic subpopulations. Progress in uncovering neural correlates of social behavior has
been limited by the tools used to characterize murine social behavior, since existing social assays lack trial-
structure needed for statistical power and common measurements of social behavior are simplistic (e.g. sniffing).
Overcoming this challenge required developing a trial-based social competition assay in which mice compete
against cagemates for a reward signaled by a tone. Due to its trial structure, this assay facilitates the
quantification of social behaviors and subsequently the identification of neural correlates for social dominance.
In this assay, dominant mice win most of the rewards across trials, occupy the reward port and displace mice
from the reward port more often than subordinates. Machine learning approaches will be used to profile the
behavioral differences seen across social rank during the competition assay. Utilizing this ethologically relevant
social competition assay, circuit manipulations, in vivo neural recording methods and machine learning allows
testing the hypothesis that the tripartite vHPC-mPFC-LH circuit encodes social dominance. Altogether, this
research will provide a new approach to study social dominance and will further our understanding of how the
distributed circuits of the mPFC modulate social behavior. Furthermore, pinpointing the neural circuits underlying
social behaviors will facilitate identification of potential therapeutics for social deficits in psychiatric disorders.
Finally, completion of this research will provide training opportunities in statistical approaches for behavioral
analysis and new circuit dissection tools, which are essential for the candidate to become an expert in social
neuroscience and to start a successful independent research program."
